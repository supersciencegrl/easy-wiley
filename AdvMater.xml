         <title>Stapled Liposomes Enhance Cross&#8208;priming of Radio&#8208;immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The release of tumor&#8208;associated antigens (TAAs) and their cross&#8208;presentation in dendritic cells (DCs) are crucial for radio&#8208;immunotherapy. However, the irradiation resistance of tumor cells usually results in limited TAA generation and release. Importantly, TAAs internalized by DCs are easily degraded in lysosomes, resulting in unsatisfactory extent of TAA cross&#8208;presentation. Herein, we developed an antigen&#8208;capturing stapled liposome (ACSL) with a robust structure and bioactive surface. The ACSLs captured and transported TAAs from lysosomes to the cytoplasm in DCs, thereby enhancing TAA cross&#8208;presentation. L&#8208;arginine encapsulated in ACSLs induced robust T cell&#8208;dependent antitumor response and immune memory in 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mice after local irradiation, resulting in significant tumor suppression and an abscopal effect. Replacing L&#8208;arginine with radiosensitizers, photosensitizers, and photothermal agents may make ACSL a universal platform for the rapid development of various combinations of anticancer therapies.

         <title>Quenching&#8208;Resistant Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emitter Realizes 40% External Quantum Efficiency in Narrowband Electroluminescence at High Doping Level</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters manifest great potential for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) due to their high exciton&#8208;utilization efficiency and narrowband emission. Nonetheless, their tendency towards self&#8208;quenching caused by strong interchromophore interactions would induce doping sensitivity and deteriorate the device performances, and effective strategy to construct quenching&#8208;resistant emitters without deteriorating color purity is still to be developed. By segregating the planar MR&#8208;TADF skeleton using two bulky carbazolyl units, we herein report a highly emissive molecule with enhanced quenching resistance. The steric effect largely removed the formation of detrimental excimers/aggregates, and boosted the performance of the corresponding devices with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) up to 40.0% and full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 25&#160;nm, representative of the only example of single OLED that can concurrently achieve narrow bandwidth and high EL efficiency surpassing 40% to date. Even at doping ratio of 30 wt%, the EQEmax is retained to be 33.3% with nearly unchanged emission spectrum. This work provides a viable approach to realize doping&#8208;insensitive MR&#8208;TADF devices with extreme EL efficiency and color purity for high&#8208;end OLED displays.

         <title>Asymmetric Elimination Reaction on Chiral Metal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral intermetallic compounds are promising candidates to promote heterogeneous asymmetric catalysis. Combining experimental and theoretical surface science methods, enantiospecific control is demonstrated for a halogen elimination reaction with a difference in the debromination temperatures of the two surface enantiomers of up to an unprecedented 46 K on the prototypical chiral intermetallic PdGa{111} surfaces.








Abstract
The production of enantiopure materials and molecules is of uttermost relevance in research and industry in numerous contexts, ranging from nonlinear optics to asymmetric synthesis. In the context of the latter, dehalogenation, which is an essential reaction step for a broad class of chemical reactions, is investigated; specifically, dehalogenation of prochiral 5&#8208;bromo&#8208;7&#8208;methylbenz(a)anthracene (BMA) on prototypical, chiral, intermetallic PdGa{111} surfaces under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Asymmetric halogen elimination is demonstrated by combining temperature&#8208;programmed X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and density functional theory. On the PdGa{111} surfaces, the difference in debromination temperatures for the two BMA surface enantiomers amounts up to an unprecedented 46 K. The significant dependence of the dehalogenation temperature of the BMA surface enantiomers on the atomic termination of the PdGa{111} surfaces implies that the ensemble effect is pronounced in this reaction step. These findings evidence enantiospecific control and hence promote intrinsically chiral crystals for asymmetric on&#8208;surface synthesis.

         <title>Liquid Gating meniscus&#8208;shaped Deformable Magnetoelastic Membranes with self&#8208;driven Regulation of gas/liquid Release</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Liquid gating membranes have been demonstrated to show unprecedented properties of dynamicity, stability, adaptivity, and stimulus&#8208;responsiveness. Most recently, smart liquid gating membranes have attracted increasing attention to bring some brand&#8208;new properties for real&#8208;world applications, and various environment&#8208;driven systems have been created. Here, a self&#8208;driven system of a smart liquid gating membrane is further developed, by designing a new liquid gating magnetoelastic membrane&#8208;based system with reversible meniscus&#8208;shaped deformations, and it is not subject to the complex gating liquid restriction of magnetorheological fluid. Compared with other systems, this magnetic responsive self&#8208;driven system has the advantage that it provides a universal and convenient way to realize active regulation of gas/liquid release. Experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrate the stability, the non&#8208;fouling behavior, and the tunability of the system. In addition, this system can be used to perfectly open and close gas transport, and the gating pressure threshold for the liquid release can be reduced under the same conditions. Based on the above capabilities, combined with the fast and three&#8208;dimensional contactless operation, it will be of benefit in fields ranging from visible gas/liquid mixture content monitoring and energy&#8208;saving multiphase separation, remote fluid release and beyond.

         <title>Low&#8208;threshold, highly stable colloidal quantum dot short&#8208;wave infrared laser enabled by suppression of trap&#8208;assisted Auger recombination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Pb&#8208;chalcogenide colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are attractive materials to be used as tuneable laser media across the infrared spectrum. However, excessive nonradiative Auger recombination due to the presence of trap states outcompetes light amplification by rapidly annihilating the exciton population, leading to high gain thresholds. Here, we employ a binary blend of CQDs and ZnO nanocrystals in order to passivate the in&#8208;gap trap states of PbS&#8208;CQD gain medium. Using transient absorption, we measure a five&#8208;fold increase in Auger lifetime demonstrating the suppression of trap&#8208;assisted Auger recombination. By doing so, we achieve a two&#8208;fold reduction in amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) threshold. Finally, by integrating our proposed binary blend to a DFB resonator, we demonstrate single&#8208;mode lasing emission at 1650&#160;nm with a linewidth of 1.23&#160;nm (0.62 meV), operating at a low lasing threshold of &#8764;385 &#956;J.cm&#8211;2. The Auger suppression in this system has allowed to achieve unprecedented lasing emission stability for a CQD laser with recorded continuous operation of 5 hours at room temperature and ambient conditions.

         <title>Anisotropic Foams Via Frontal Polymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The properties of foams, an important class of cellular solids, are most sensitive to the volume fraction and openness of its elementary compartments; size, shape, orientation, and the interconnectedness of the cells are other important design attributes. Control of these morphological traits would allow the tailored fabrication of useful materials including highly porous solids, anisotropic heat conductors, tough composites, among others. While approaches like ice templating has produced foams with elongated cells, there is a need for rapid, versatile, and energy efficient methods that also control the local order and macroscopic alignment of cellular elements. Here we describe a fast and convenient method to obtain anisotropic structural foams using frontal polymerization. We fabricated foams by curing mixtures of dicyclopentadiene and a physical blowing agent via frontal ring opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP). The materials were characterized using micro&#8208;computed tomography (Micro&#8208;CT) and an image analysis protocol to quantify morphological characteristics including volume fraction and anisotropy. The cellular structure, porosity, and hardness of the foams changed with blowing agent, concentration, and resin viscosity. Moreover, we used a full factorial combination of variables to correlate each parameter with the structure of the obtained foams. We found a strong correlation between the resin viscosity and the foam's cellular structure. Furthermore, a specific combination of input parameters controlled the transitions from (i) isotropic to anisotropic cellular structures, (ii) porous to non&#8208;porous, and (iii) soft to hard foams. Our results demonstrate the controlled production of foams with specific morphologies using the simple and efficient method of frontal polymerization. This work shows promise for creating foams with aligned cellular structures that allow anisotropic mass and energy transport properties in high performance structural solids.

         <title>Two Birds with One Stone: Interfacial Engineering of Multifunctional Janus Separator for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Li dendrite growth and unsatisfactory sulfur cathode performance are two core problems that greatly restrict the practical applications of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Here, an all&#8208;in&#8208;one design concept for Janus separator enabled by the interfacial engineering strategy is proposed to improve the performance of LSBs. At the interface of anode/separator, the thin functionalized composite layer contains the high&#8208;elastic&#8208;modulus and high&#8208;thermal&#8208;conductivity boron nitride nanosheets and oxygen group&#8208;grafted cellulose nanofibers (BNNs@CNFs), which can effectively avoid the formation of &#8220;hot spot&#8221;, homogenize Li&#8208;ion flux, and suppress dendrite growth. Meanwhile, at the interface between separator and cathode, the high&#8208;density homogenously exposed Ru single atoms on the surface of reduced graphene oxide (rGO@Ru SAs) can &#8220;trap&#8221; the polysulfides and considerably reduce the activation energy to boost their conversion kinetics. Consequently, the LSBs show a high capacity of 460 mAh g&#8211;1 at 5 C and ultrastable cycling performance with an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.046% per cycle over 800 cycles. To further demonstrate the practical prospect of our Janus separator, an assembled Li&#8208;S pouch cell using our Janus separator delivers a cell&#8208;level energy density of 310.2&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1. This study provides a promising strategy to simultaneously tackle the challenges facing metallic Li anode and sulfur cathode in LSBs.

&lt;p&gt;Li dendrite growth and unsatisfactory sulfur cathode performance are two core problems that greatly restrict the practical applications of lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). Here, an all-in-one design concept for Janus separator enabled by the interfacial engineering strategy is proposed to improve the performance of LSBs. At the interface of anode/separator, the thin functionalized composite layer contains the high-elastic-modulus and high-thermal-conductivity boron nitride nanosheets and oxygen group-grafted cellulose nanofibers (BNNs@CNFs), which can effectively avoid the formation of &#8220;hot spot&#8221;, homogenize Li-ion flux, and suppress dendrite growth. Meanwhile, at the interface between separator and cathode, the high-density homogenously exposed Ru single atoms on the surface of reduced graphene oxide (rGO@Ru SAs) can &#8220;trap&#8221; the polysulfides and considerably reduce the activation energy to boost their conversion kinetics.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;fast Synthesis of I&#8208;rich Lithium Argyrodite Glass&#8208;Ceramic Electrolyte with High Ionic Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lithium argyrodites are one of the most promising sulfide electrolytes due to their high ionic conductivity and ductile feature. Among them, Li6PS5I (LPSI) exhibits better stability against Li metal but a rather low ionic conductivity (only &#8764; 10&#8211;6 S cm&#8211;1) because of the absence of S2&#8211;/I&#8211; disorder. Herein, argyrodite Li6&#8211;xPS5&#8211;xI1+x glass&#8208;ceramic electrolytes with high iodine content are synthesized using ultimate&#8208;energy mechanical alloying method. S2&#8211;/I&#8211; disorder is successfully introduced into the system by doping LiI during this one&#8208;pot process. Determined by 6Li magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, the introduction of iodine promotes Li+ inter&#8208;cage jumps, leading to an enhanced long&#8208;range Li+ conducting. The Li5.6PS4.6I1.4 glass&#8208;ceramic electrolyte (LPSI1.4&#8208;gc) possess high ionic conductivity (2.04 mS cm&#8211;1) and excellent stability against Li metal. The Li symmetric cell with the LPSI1.4&#8208;gc electrolyte demonstrates ultra&#8208;long cycling stability over 3200 h at 0.2&#160;mA cm&#8211;2. LiCoO2/Li6PS5Cl/Li all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery applying LPSI1.4&#8208;gc as the anode interlayer also presents prominent cycling and rate performance. This work provides a novel type of electrolyte with high ionic conductivity and stability against Li metal.

         <title>Orientation Heredity in The Transformation of Two&#8208;Dimensional Epitaxial Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Controlling the lattice orientation is significant for both two&#8208;dimensional (2D) vdW layered and non&#8208;layered film growth process. Here we report a unique and universal phenomena termed lattice orientation heredity (LOH). The LOH enables product films (including 2D layered materials) to inherit the lattice orientation from reactant films in a chemical conversion process, excluding the requirement on the substrate lattice order. We demonstrate the process universality by investigating the lattice transformations in the carbonization, nitridation, and sulfurization of epitaxial MoO2, ZnO, and In2O3 thin films. Their resultant compounds all inherit mono&#8208;oriented feature from their precursor oxides, including 2D vdW layered semiconductors (e.g., MoS2), metallic films (e.g., MXene&#8208;like Mo2C and MoN), wide bandgap semiconductors (e.g., hexagonal ZnS), and ferroelectric semiconductors (e.g., In2S3). Using LOH&#8208;grown MoN as a seeding layer, we achieved mono&#8208;oriented GaN on an amorphous quartz substrate. The LOH process is a universal strategy capable of growing epitaxial thin films (including 2D vdW layered materials) not only on single&#8208;crystalline but also the non&#8208;crystalline.

         <title>Strong &#960;&#8722;&#960; Stacking Stabilized Nanophotosensitizers: Improving Tumor Retention for Enhanced Therapy to Large Tumor in Mice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Conventional photosensitizers (PSs) often show poor tumor retention and are rapidly cleared from the bloodstream, which is one of the key hindrances to guarantee precise and efficient photodynamic therapy (PDT) in vivo. In this work, we present a photosensitizer assembly nanosystem that sharply enhances tumor retention up to &#8764;10 days. The PSs are synthesized by meso&#8208;substituting anthracene onto the BODIPY scaffold (AN&#8208;BDP), which then self&#8208;assemble into stable nanoparticles (AN&#8208;BDP NPs) with amphiphilic block copolymers due to the strong intermolecular &#960;&#8722;&#960; interaction of anthracene. Additionally, the incorporated anthracene excites the PSs, producing singlet oxygen under red light irradiation. Although AN&#8208;BDP NPs could completely suppress regular test size tumor (&#8764;100 mm3) by one&#8208;time radiation, only 12% tumour growth inhibition rate was observed in the case of large size tumor (&#8764;350 mm3) under the same conditions. Due to the long time tumor retention, AN&#8208;BDP NPs allows single&#8208;dose injection and three&#8208;time light treatments, resulting in an over 90% inhibition rate, much more efficient than single&#8208;time radiation of conventional clinically used PSs including chlorin (Ce6) and porphyrin with poor tumor retention. The results reveal the importance of long tumor retention time of PSs for efficient PDT, which can accelerate the clinical development of nanophotosensitizers.

Due to the long time tumor retention, &lt;b&gt;AN-BDP&lt;/b&gt; NPs allows single-dose injection and three-time light treatments, resulting in an over 90% inhibition rate, much more efficient than single-time radiation of conventional clinically used PSs including chlorin (Ce6) and porphyrin with poor tumor retention. The results reveal the importance of long tumor retention time of PSs for efficient PDT, which can accelerate the clinical development of nanophotosensitizers.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Boosting Piezoelectricity Under Illumination via the Bulk Photovoltaic Effect and the Schottky Barrier Effect in BiFeO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Piezoelectricity is a key functionality induced by conversion between mechanical and electrical energy. Enhancement of piezoelectricity in ferroelectrics often has been realized by complicated synthetical approaches to host unique structural boundaries, so&#8208;called morphotropic phase boundaries. While structural approaches have been well&#8208;known, enhancing piezoelectricity by external stimuli has yet to be clearly explored despite their advantages of offering not only simple and in&#8208;situ control without any prior processing requirement, but compatibility with other functionalities. Here, we show that light is a powerful control parameter to enhance the piezoelectric property of a BiFeO3 single crystal. Our series of PFM and C&#8208;AFM based measurements under illumination reveal a locally enhanced effective piezoelectric coefficient, dzz, eventually showing almost a seven&#8208;fold increase. We explain this phenomenon with theoretical models by introducing the two main underlying mechanisms attributed to the bulk photovoltaic effect and Schottky barrier effect, involving the role of open circuit voltage and photocharge carrier density. These results provide key insights to light&#8208;induced piezoelectricity enhancement, offering its potential for multifunctional optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Efficient Tandem Quantum&#8208;Dot LEDs Enabled by An Inorganic Semiconductor&#8208;Metal&#8208;Dielectric Interconnecting Layer Stack</title>

Abstract
Light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) in a tandem configuration offer a strategy to realize high&#8208;performance, multi&#8208;colour devices. Until now, though, the efficiency of tandem colloidal quantum dot LEDs (QLEDs) has been limited due to unpassivated interfaces and solvent damage originating from the materials processing requirements of interconnecting layers (ICLs). Here we report an ICL consisting of a semiconductor&#8208;metal&#8208;dielectric stack that provides facile fabrication, materials stability, and good optoelectronic coupling. We investigate experimentally how the ICL enables charge balance, suppresses current leakage, and prevents solvent damage to the underlying layers. We report as a result record efficiencies for double&#8208;junction tandem QLEDs, whose emission wavelengths cover from blue to red light:, i.e., external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 40% (average 37+/&#8208;2%) for red, 49% (average 45+/&#8208;2%) for yellow, 50% (average 46+/&#8208;2%) for green, and 24% (average 21+/&#8208;2%) for blue are achieved.

         <title>Annealing Accelerator for Ising Spin Systems based on In&#8208;memory Complementary 2D FETs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metaheuristic algorithms such as simulated annealing (SA) has been implemented for optimization in combinatorial problems, especially for discreet problems. SA employs a stochastic search, where high&#8208;energy transitions (&#8220;hill&#8208;climbing&#8221;) are allowed with a temperature&#8208;dependent probability to escape local optima. Ising spin glass systems have properties such as spin disorder and &#8220;frustration&#8221; and provide a discreet combinatorial problem with high number of metastable states and ground&#8208;state degeneracy. In this work, we exploit subthreshold Boltzmann transport in complementary two&#8208;dimensional (2D) field effect transistors (p&#8208;type WSe2 and n&#8208;type MoS2) integrated with analog, non&#8208;volatile, and programmable floating&#8208;gate memory stack to develop in&#8208;memory computing primitives necessary for energy and area efficient hardware acceleration of SA for the Ising spin systems. We experimentally demonstrate &gt;&#160;800X search acceleration for 4 &#215; 4 ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and a spin glass system using SA compared to an exhaustive search using brute force trial at miniscule total energy expenditure of &#8764;120 nJ. Our hardware&#8208;realistic numerical simulations further highlight the astounding benefits of SA in accelerating the search for larger spin lattices.

         <title>Lattice Polarity Manipulation of Quasi&#8208;vdW Epitaxial GaN Films on Graphene Through Interface Atomic Configuration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Quasi van der Waals (vdW) epitaxy, a pioneering epitaxy of sp3&#8208;hybridized semiconductor films on sp2&#8208;hybridized two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials, provides a way, in principle, to achieve single&#8208;crystal epilayers with preferred atom configurations that are free of substrate. Unfortunately, this has not been experimentally confirmed in the case of the hexagonal semiconductor III&#8208;nitride epilayer until now. Here, for the first time, we report that the epitaxy of gallium nitride (GaN) on graphene can tune the atom arrangement (lattice polarity) through manipulation of the interface atomic configuration, where GaN films with gallium and nitrogen polarity were achieved by forming C&#8208;O&#8208;N&#8208;Ga(3) or C&#8208;O&#8208;Ga&#8208;N(3) configurations, respectively, on artificial C&#8208;O surface dangling bonds by atomic oxygen preirradiation on trilayer graphene. Furthermore, an aluminum nitride (AlN) buffer/interlayer leads to unique metal polarity due to the formation of an AlON thin layer in a growth environment containing trace amounts of oxygen, which explains the open question why those reported wurtzite III&#8208;nitride films on 2D materials always exhibit metal polarity. The reported atomic modulation through interface manipulation provides an effective model for hexagonal nitride semiconductor layer grown on graphene, which definitely promotes the development of novel semiconductor devices.

         <title>3D Printed MXene Aerogels with Truly 3D Macrostructure and Highly Engineered Microstructure for Enhanced Electrical and Electrochemical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D printing method based on inkjet printing and unidirectional freeze casting is utilized to fabricate pristine Ti3C2Tx aerogels with truly 3D shapes and vertically aligned MXene sheets. 3D printed aerogels are proposed for flexible/wearable electronics due to their excellent electromechanical performance. Enhanced electrochemical performance of the micro&#8208;supercapacitors is attributed to the improved electrical conductivity and ionic diffusion achieved simultaneously.








Abstract
Assembling 2D materials such as MXenes into functional 3D aerogels using 3D printing technologies gains attention due to simplicity of fabrication, customized geometry and physical properties, and improved performance. Also, the establishment of straightforward electrode fabrication methods with the aim to hinder the restack and/or aggregation of electrode materials, which limits the performance of the electrode, is of great significant. In this study, unidirectional freeze casting and inkjet&#8208;based 3D printing are combined to fabricate macroscopic porous aerogels with vertically aligned Ti3C2Tx sheets. The fabrication method is developed to easily control the aerogel microstructure and alignment of the MXene sheets. The aerogels show excellent electromechanical performance so that they can withstand almost 50% compression before recovering to the original shape and maintain their electrical conductivities during continuous compression cycles. To enhance the electrochemical performance, an inkjet&#8208;printed MXene current collector layer is added with horizontally aligned MXene sheets. This combines the superior electrical conductivity of the current collector layer with the improved ionic diffusion provided by the porous electrode. The cells fabricated with horizontal MXene sheets alignment as current collector with subsequent vertical MXene sheets alignment layers show the best electrochemical performance with thickness&#8208;independent capacitive behavior.

         <title>Ultrafast&#8208;Response/Recovery Flexible Piezoresistive Sensors with DNA&#8208;Like Double Helix Yarns for Epidermal Pulse Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hysteresis is a critical issue existing in textiles sensors. Distinct from the conventional methods, in this work, a biomimetic DNA&#8208;like double&#8208;helix structure is introduced into a textile&#8208;based pressure sensor, providing a twisting force to allow quick and sufficient recovery from the deformation. Ultimately, the hysteresis is largely inhibited together with an improved response/relaxation time.








Abstract
A key challenge in textile sensors is to adequately solve the hysteresis for more broad and exacting applications. Unlike the conventional strategy in integrating elastic polymers into the textile, the hysteretic issue is critically addressed here through the structural design of yarns to provide a twisting force. The underlying mechanism is fully discussed based on theory and modeling, which are in good agreement with experimental data. Impressively, the pressure sensor outperforms almost all reported textile&#8208;based sensors in terms of recovery index, which refers to the ability to overcome the lagged deformation reflected by the hysteresis (5.3%) and relaxation time (2&#160;ms). Besides, the sensor superiority is also demonstrated by way of its ultrafast response time (2&#160;ms). Thanks to these merits, this pressure sensor is demonstrated to be capable of monitoring epidermal pulses and meanwhile shows great potential to advance the standardization and modernization of pulse palpation in traditional Chinese medicine.

         <title>Natural Polymer in Soft Electronics: Opportunities, Challenges, and Future Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Produced and modified by living organisms, natural polymers are credible alternatives to synthetic polymers ascribing to their biodegradability, biocompatibility, and capability in interfacing with cutting&#8208;edge technologies. The adoption of natural polymers in soft electronic devices is discussed, and the key challenges in polymer&#8208;to&#8208;conductor integration, device stability, biodegradation, and their environmental impact are addressed.








Abstract
Pollution caused by nondegradable plastics has been a serious threat to environmental sustainability. Natural polymers, which can degrade in nature, provide opportunities to replace petroleum&#8208;based polymers, meanwhile driving technological advances and sustainable practices. In the research field of soft electronics, regenerated natural polymers are promising building blocks for passive dielectric substrates, active dielectric layers, and matrices in soft conductors. Here, the natural&#8208;polymer polymorphs and their compatibilization with a variety of inorganic/organic conductors through interfacial bonding/intermixing and surface functionalization for applications in various device modalities are delineated. Challenges that impede the broad utilization of natural polymers in soft electronics, including limited durability, compromises between conductivity and deformability, and limited exploration in controllable degradation, etc. are explicitly inspected, while the potential solutions along with future prospects are also proposed. Finally, integrative considerations on material properties, device functionalities, and environmental impact are addressed to warrant natural polymers as credible alternatives to synthetic ones, and provide viable options for sustainable soft electronics.

         <title>Dimensional Design and Core&#8211;Shell Engineering of Nanomaterials for Electromagnetic Wave Absorption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electromagnetic (EM) wave absorption materials possess exceptionally high EM energy loss efficiency. With vigorous developments in nanotechnology, such materials have exhibited numerous advanced EM functions, including radiation prevention and antiradar stealth. To achieve improved EM performance and multifunctionality, the elaborate control of microstructures has become an attractive research direction. By designing them as core&#8211;shell structures with different dimensions, the combined effects, such as interfacial polarization, conduction networks, magnetic coupling, and magnetic&#8211;dielectric synergy, can significantly enhance the EM wave absorption performance. This paper outlines the advances in low&#8208;dimensional core&#8211;shell EM wave absorption materials and discusses a selection of the most remarkable examples. It comprehensively summarizes the derived key information regarding dimensional design, structural engineering, performance, and structure&#8211;function relationship. Moreover, the investigation of cutting&#8208;edge mechanisms is given particular attention. Additional applications, such as oxidation resistance and self&#8208;cleaning functions, are also introduced. Finally, insight into what may be expected from this rapidly expanding field and future challenges are presented.

         <title>Dual Tumor Microenvironment Remodeling by Glucose&#8208;Contained Radical Copolymer for MRI Guided Photo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Aberrant glucose metabolism and immune evasion are recognized as two hallmarks of cancer, which contribute to poor treatment efficiency and tumor progression. Herein, a novel material system consisting of a glucose and TEMPO (2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxyl) at the distal ends of PEO&#8208;b&#8208;PLLA block copolymer (Glucose&#8208;PEO&#8208;b&#8208;PLLA&#8208;TEMPO), was designed to encapsulate clinical therapeutics CUDC101 and photosensitizer IR780. The specific core&#8208;shell rod structure formed by the designed copolymer renders TEMPO radicals excellent stability against reduction&#8208;induced MRI silence. Tumor targeting moiety endowed by glucose provides the radical copolymer outstanding multimodal imaging capabilities, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and fluorescence imaging (FLI). Efficient delivery of CUDC101 and IR780 was achieved to synergize the antitumor immune activation through IR780&#8208;mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) and CUDC101 triggered CD47 inhibition, showing M1 phenotype polarization of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs). More intriguingly, this study demonstrates PDT&#8208;stimulated p53 can also re&#8208;educate TAMs, providing a combined strategy of using dual tumor microenvironment remodeling to achieve the synergistic effect in the transition from cold immunosuppressive to hot immunoresponsive tumor microenvironment.

         <title>Atomic Visualization and Switching of Ferroelectric Order in &#946;&#8208;In2Se3 Films at the Single Layer Limit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) ferroelectrics have received wide interest due to the remarkable quantum states of emerging physics at reduced dimensionality, associated with their exotic properties in high&#8208;performance and nonvolatile functional devices. Here, by combing molecular beam epitaxy synthesis and scanning tunneling microscopy characterization, we report two metastable phases of layered In2Se3 films: &#946;&#8217;&#8208; and &#946;*&#8208;In2Se3, which develop different types of in&#8208;plane spontaneous polarizations, thus resulting in different striped morphologies. We identify the anti&#8208;ferroelectric order in &#946;&#8217;&#8208;In2Se3 and ferroelectric order of &#946;*&#8208;In2Se3, respectively, down to the 2D limit by comprehensive investigations of structural and spectroscopic signatures, including the lattice distortion, the spatial profile of images, the formation of domain structure, and the electronic band&#8208;bending by polarization charges at edges. We further control the ferroelectric switching between those two phases via applying an electric field generated from the STM tip in a reversible manner. The intriguing tunability between the (anti&#8208;)ferroelectric orders in the 2D limit provides a promising platform for studying the interplay between electronic structure and ferroelectricity in van der Waals materials, and promotes potential development of miniaturized transistors and memory devices based on electric polarizations.

         <title>Controlled Deposition of Zinc Metal Anodes via Selectively Polarized Ferroelectric Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries are regarded as ideal candidates for stationary energy storage systems due to their low cost and high safety. However, zinc can readily grow into dendrites, leading to limited cycling performance and quick failure of the batteries. Herein, we propose a novel strategy to mitigate this dendrite problem, in which selectively&#8208;polarized ferroelectric polymer material (poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF&#8208;TrFE))) is employed as a surface protective layer on zinc anodes. Such a polarized ferroelectric polymer layer could enable a locally&#8208;concentrated zinc ion distribution along the coated surface and thus enable the horizontal growth of zinc plates. As a result, symmetrical zinc batteries using such anodes exhibits long cycling lifespan at 0.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 0.2 mAh cm&#8722;2 for 2000 hours, and a high rate performance up to 15&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Also, the full cell (including Zn&#8208;MnO2 battery and zinc ion capacitor) based on this anode has been demonstrated. This work provides a novel strategy to protect the zinc anode and even other metal anodes exploiting polymer ferroelectricity.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous zinc ion batteries are regarded as ideal candidates for stationary energy storage systems due to their low cost and high safety. However, zinc can readily grow into dendrites, leading to limited cycling performance and quick failure of the batteries. Herein, we propose a novel strategy to mitigate this dendrite problem, in which selectively-polarized ferroelectric polymer material (poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE))) is employed as a surface protective layer on zinc anodes. Such a polarized ferroelectric polymer layer could enable a locally-concentrated zinc ion distribution along the coated surface and thus enable the horizontal growth of zinc plates. As a result, symmetrical zinc batteries using such anodes exhibits long cycling lifespan at 0.2&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 0.2 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 2000 hours, and a high rate performance up to 15&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Also, the full cell (including Zn-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery and zinc ion capacitor) based on this anode has been demonstrated. This work provides a novel strategy to protect the zinc anode and even other metal anodes exploiting polymer ferroelectricity.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Copper&#8208;free Click Chemistry: Applications in Drug Delivery, Cell Tracking and Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Traditionally, organic chemical reactions require organic solvents, toxic catalysts, heat, or high pressure. However, copper&#8208;free click chemistry has been shown to have favorable reaction rates and orthogonality in water, buffer solutions, and physiological conditions without toxic catalysts. Strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition and inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reactions are representative of copper&#8208;free click chemistry. Artificial chemical reactions via click chemistry can also be used outside of the laboratory in a controllable manner on live cell surfaces, in the cytosol, and in living bodies. Consequently, copper&#8208;free click chemistry has many features that are of interest in biomedical research, and various new materials and strategies for its use have been proposed. Herein, we describe recent remarkable trials that have used copper&#8208;free click chemistry, focusing on their applications in molecular imaging and therapy. We have categorized the research as nanoparticles for drug delivery, imaging agents for cell tracking, and hydrogels for tissue engineering, which are rapidly advancing fields based on click chemistry. The content is based primarily on our experience with click chemistry&#8208;based biomaterials over the last ten years.

         <title>Liquid Crystal Elastomer Metamaterials with Giant Biaxial Thermal Shrinkage for Enhancing Skin Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unique mechanics&#8208;guided designs and fabrication schemes of liquid crystal elastomer metamaterials that allow access to unprecedented biaxial actuation shrinkage and negative thermal expansion are developed. A low&#8208;temperature synthesis method enables excellent actuation performances at a substantially reduced temperature. Such a biocompatible metamaterial is integrated with a dressing to develop a shrinkable, hemostatic patch for enhancing skin regeneration.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are a class of soft active materials of increasing interest, because of their excellent actuation and optical performances. While LCEs show biomimetic mechanical properties (e.g., elastic modulus and strength) that can be matched with those of soft biological tissues, their biointegrated applications have been rarely explored, in part, due to their high actuation temperatures (typically above 60&#160;&#176;C) and low biaxial actuation performances (e.g., actuation strain typically below 10%). Here, unique mechanics&#8208;guided designs and fabrication schemes of LCE metamaterials are developed that allow access to unprecedented biaxial actuation strain (&#8722;53%) and biaxial coefficient of thermal expansion (&#8722;33&#160;125&#160;ppm&#160;K&#8722;1), significantly surpassing those (e.g., &#8722;20% and &#8722;5950&#160;ppm&#160;K&#8722;1) reported previously. A low&#8208;temperature synthesis method with use of optimized composition ratios enables LCE metamaterials to offer reasonably high actuation stresses/strains at a substantially reduced actuation temperature (46&#160;&#176;C). Such biocompatible LCE metamaterials are integrated with medical dressing to develop a breathable, shrinkable, hemostatic patch as a means of noninvasive treatment. In vivo animal experiments of skin repair with both round and cross&#8208;shaped wounds demonstrate advantages of the hemostatic patch over conventional strategies (e.g., medical dressing and suturing) in accelerating skin regeneration, while avoiding scar and keloid generation.

         <title>In Situ Formation of Nano Ni&#8211;Co Oxyhydroxide Enables Water Oxidation Electrocatalysts Durable at High Current Densities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable synthesis method of nanocrystalline metal selenides is developed to achieve both high activity and stability of electrocatalysts used for water oxidation, important for green hydrogen production. The formation of defective and coordinatively unsaturated sites by milling at cryogenic temperatures facilitates the hydration of metal sites to form active nanosized oxyhydroxides.








Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) limits the energy efficiency of electrocatalytic systems due to the high overpotential symptomatic of poor reaction kinetics; this problem worsens over time if the performance of the OER electrocatalyst diminishes during operation. Here, a novel synthesis of nanocrystalline Ni&#8211;Co&#8211;Se using ball milling at cryogenic temperature is reported. It is discovered that, by anodizing the Ni&#8211;Co&#8211;Se structure during OER, Se ions leach out of the original structure, allowing water molecules to hydrate Ni and Co defective sites, and the nanoparticles to evolve into an active Ni&#8211;Co oxyhydroxide. This transformation is observed using operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, with the findings confirmed using density functional theory calculations. The resulting electrocatalyst exhibits an overpotential of 279&#160;mV at 0.5 A cm&#8722;2 and 329&#160;mV at 1 A cm&#8722;2 and sustained performance for 500 h. This is achieved using low mass loadings (0.36&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) of cobalt. Incorporating the electrocatalyst in an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer yields a current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.75&#160;V for 95 h without decay in performance. When the electrocatalyst is integrated into a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethylene electrolyzer, a record&#8208;setting full cell voltage of 3&#160;V at current density 1 A cm&#8722;2 is achieved.

         <title>Bioinspired Multifunctional Photonic&#8208;Electronic Smart Skin for Ultrasensitive Health Monitoring, for Visual and Self&#8208;Powered Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasensitive self&#8208;powered mechanoluminescence smart skin (SPMSS) with bioinspired strain&#8208;dependent micro crack structure is designed and fabricated. The SPMSS demonstrates ultrasensitive sensing performances including ultralow detection limit, ultrahigh sensitivity, and ultrafast response. The SPMSS displays tunable and highly sensitive mechanoluminescence features for visual sensing and exhibits excellent triboelectric nanogenerator properties for reliable power source supply and self&#8208;powered sensing.








Abstract
Smart skin is highly desired to be ultrasensitive and self&#8208;powered as the medium of artificial intelligence. Here, an ultrasensitive self&#8208;powered mechanoluminescence smart skin (SPMSS) inspired by the luminescence mechanism of cephalopod skin and the ultrasensitive response of spider&#8208;slit&#8208;organ is developed. Benefitting from the unique strain&#8208;dependent microcrack structure design based on Ti3C2Tx (MXene)/carbon nanotube synergistic interaction, SPMSS possesses excellent strain sensing performances including ultralow detection limit (0.001% strain), ultrahigh sensitivity (gauge factor, GF = 3.92 &#215; 107), ultrafast response time (5&#160;ms), and superior durability and stability (&gt;45&#8201;000 cycles). Synchronously, SPMSS exhibits tunable and highly sensitive mechanoluminescence (ML) features under stretching. A relationship between ML features, strain sensing performances, and the deformation has been established successfully. Importantly, the SPMSS demonstrates excellent properties as triboelectric nanogenerator (4 &#215; 4 cm2), including ultrahigh triboelectric output (open&#8208;circuit voltage VOC&#160;= 540&#160;V, short&#8208;circuit current ISC&#160;= 42 &#181;A, short&#8208;circuit charge QSC&#160;= 317 nC) and power density (7.42 W m&#8722;2), endowing the smart skin with reliable power source supply and self&#8208;powered sensing ability. This bioinspired smart skin exhibits multifunctional applications in health monitoring, visual sensing, and self&#8208;powered sensing, showing great potential in artificial intelligence.

         <title>Synergistic Therapy of a Naturally Inspired Glycopolymer&#8208;Based Biomimetic Nanomedicine Harnessing Tumor Genomic Instability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the saccharide unit and its weak interactions and the combined advantages of branched polymers, glycopolymer&#8211;pyropheophorbide&#8208;a conjugates are optimized for enhanced photodynamic therapy (PDT), effective olaparib incorporation, and natural tumor cell membrane modified ability. The obtained biomimetic nanomedicine with homotypic cancer targeting ability achieves a prominent antitumor effect via harnessing tumor genomic instability, providing a platform strategy for synergistic nanomedicines combat with cancer.








Abstract
Inspired by natural saccharide&#8208;protein complexes, a stimuli&#8208;responsive biodegradable and branched glycopolymer&#8211;pyropheophorbide&#8208;a (Ppa) conjugate (BSP) with saccharide units for cancer therapy is constructed. A linear glycopolymeric conjugate (LSP), a branched glycopolymeric conjugate (BShP) from Ppa with long carbon chains, and a branched conjugate (BHSP) based on poly[N&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide] (polyHPMA) without saccharide units are prepared as controls. Through structure&#8211;activity relationship studies, BSP with a 3D network structure forms stable nanostructures via weak intermolecular interactions, regulating the stacking state of Ppa to improve the singlet oxygen quantum yield and the corresponding photodynamic therapy (PDT) effect. BSP shows high loading of olaparib, and are further coated with tumor cell membranes, resulting in a biomimetic nanomedicine (CM&#8208;BSPO). CM&#8208;BSPO shows highly efficient tumor targeting and cellular internalization properties. The engulfment of CM&#8208;BSPO accompanied with laser irradiation results in a prominent antitumor effect, evidenced by disruption of cell cycles in tumor cells, increased apoptosis and DNA damage, and subsequent inhibition of repair for damaged DNA. The mechanism for the synergistic effect from PDT and olaparib is unveiled at the genetic and protein level through transcriptome analysis. Overall, this biodegradable and branched glycopolymer&#8211;drug conjugate could be effectively optimized as a biomimetic nanomedicine for cancer therapy.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed High&#8208;Density Al&#8211;N4 Sites in Porous Carbon for Efficient Photodriven CO2 Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous carbon possessing atomically dispersed Al&#8211;N4 motifs exhibits excellent catalytic performance for photothermal CO2 cycloaddition reaction by taking advantage of the uniformly dispersed Al/N species and the efficient photothermal effect of the carbon matrix. Importantly, the photogenerated electrons favor transfer from Al&#8211;N&#8211;C to epoxide and significantly accelerate the rate&#8208;limiting step, which opens a new activation mechanism for CO2 cycloaddition reaction.








Abstract
Highly active catalysts that can directly utilize renewable energy (e.g., solar energy) are desirable for CO2 value&#8208;added processes. Herein, aiming at improving the efficiency of photodriven CO2 cycloaddition reactions, a catalyst composed of porous carbon nanosheets enriched with a high loading of atomically dispersed Al atoms (&#8776;14.4&#160;wt%, corresponding to an atomic percent of &#8776;7.3%) coordinated with N (AlN4 motif, Al&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst) via a versatile molecule&#8208;confined pyrolysis strategy is reported. The performance of the Al&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst for catalytic CO2 cycloaddition under light irradiation (&#8776;95% conversion, reaction rate = 3.52 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) is significantly superior to that obtained under a thermal environment (&#8776;57% conversion, reaction rate = 2.11 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Besides the efficient photothermal conversion induced by the carbon matrix, both experimental and theoretical analysis reveal that light irradiation favors the photogenerated electron transfer from the semiconductive Al&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst to the epoxide reactant, facilitating the formation of a ring&#8208;opened intermediate through the rate&#8208;limiting step. This study not only provides an advanced Al&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst for photodriven CO2 cycloaddition, but also furnishes new insight for the rational design of superior photocatalysts for diverse heterogeneous catalytic reactions in the future.

         <title>Highly Selective Adsorption of Carbon Dioxide over Acetylene in an Ultramicroporous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Partially desolvated Cu&#8208;F&#8208;pymo can exclusively capture CO2 over C2H2 with very high selectivity. Sorption experiments and modeling studies reveal that such a molecular sieving effect is attributed to the suppression of C2H2 adsorption by residual water molecules. The inverse separation is further confirmed by column breakthrough studies given that highly pure acetylene (&gt;99.9%) can be directly harvested.








Abstract
Separating carbon dioxide from fuel gases like hydrocarbons by physical adsorbents is industrially important and more energy&#8208;efficient than traditional liquid extraction or cryogenic distillation methods. It is very important while very challenging to develop CO2&#8208;selective adsorbents, considering CO2 is less polarizable than light hydrocarbon molecules, particularly those simultaneously with almost identical molecular dimensions and physical properties, such as acetylene. Herein, an ultramicroporous metal&#8211;organic framework constructed from copper(II) and 5&#8208;fluoropyrimidin&#8208;2&#8208;olate, termed Cu&#8208;F&#8208;pymo, is carefully studied under different activations for inverse separation of CO2 from C2H2. The partially desolvated Cu&#8208;F&#8208;pymo can exclusively capture CO2 over C2H2 with very high selectivity exceeding 105 under ambient conditions, the highest ever reported. Sorption experiments and modeling studies reveal that such molecular sieving effect is attributed to the suppression of C2H2 adsorption from the blockage of the preferential sites for C2H2 by residual water molecules. The inverse separation is further confirmed by column breakthrough studies given that highly pure acetylene (&gt;99.9%) can be directly harvested from the gas mixture. Cu&#8208;F&#8208;pymo also shows remarkable stability under harsh conditions.

         <title>Rational Design and General Synthesis of Multimetallic Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nano&#8208;Octahedra for Enhanced Li&#8211;S Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Mn&#8208;based multimetallic metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nano&#8208;octahedra are prepared. The synthetic strategy is utilized to incorporate metal ions into the MOF architecture, of which the parent monometallic MOF nano&#8208;octahedra could not be prepared directly, thus rationally generating novel multimetallic MOFs, which also allows for the general synthesis of various micro&#8208;/nanoscale MOFs in the energy storage field.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), which consist of central metal nodes and organic linkers, constitute a fast growing class of crystalline porous materials with excellent application potential. Herein, a series of Mn&#8208;based multimetallic MOF (bimetallic and trimetallic MIL&#8208;100) nano&#8208;octahedra are prepared by a facile one&#8208;pot synthetic strategy. The types and proportions of the incorporated elements can be tuned while retaining the original topological structure. The introduction of other metal ions is verified at the atomic level by combining X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure experiments and theoretical calculations. Furthermore, these multimetallic Mn&#8208;based MIL&#8208;100 nano&#8208;octahedra are utilized as sulfur hosts to prepare cathodes for Li&#8211;S batteries. The MnNi&#8208;MIL&#8208;100@S cathode exhibits the best Li&#8211;S battery performance among all reported MIL&#8208;100@S composite cathode materials, with a reversible capacity of &#8776;708.8 mAh g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles. The synthetic strategy described herein is utilized to incorporate metal ions into the MOF architecture, of which the parent monometallic MOF nano&#8208;octahedra cannot be prepared directly, thus rationally generating novel multimetallic MOFs. Importantly, the strategy also allows for the general synthesis and study of various micro&#8208;/nanoscale MOFs in the energy storage field.

&lt;p&gt;Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), which consist of central metal nodes and organic linkers, constitute a fast growing class of crystalline porous materials with excellent application potential. Herein, a series of Mn-based multimetallic MOF (bimetallic and trimetallic MIL-100) nano-octahedra are prepared by a facile one-pot synthetic strategy. The types and proportions of the incorporated elements can be tuned while retaining the original topological structure. The introduction of other metal ions is verified at the atomic level by combining X-ray absorption fine structure experiments and theoretical calculations. Furthermore, these multimetallic Mn-based MIL-100 nano-octahedra are utilized as sulfur hosts to prepare cathodes for Li&#8211;S batteries. The MnNi-MIL-100@S cathode exhibits the best Li&#8211;S battery performance among all reported MIL-100@S composite cathode materials, with a reversible capacity of &#8776;708.8 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 200 cycles. The synthetic strategy described herein is utilized to incorporate metal ions into the MOF architecture, of which the parent monometallic MOF nano-octahedra cannot be prepared directly, thus rationally generating novel multimetallic MOFs. Importantly, the strategy also allows for the general synthesis and study of various micro-/nanoscale MOFs in the energy storage field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3D Printing of Superhydrophobic Objects with Bulk Nanostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The principle of polymerization&#8208;induced phase separation is exploited to 3D print superhydrophobic objects with bulk nanostructure and unlimited geometrical freedom. The bulk nanoporous structure of the 3D&#8208;printed superhydrophobic objects not only makes them tolerant to abrasion damage, but also opens new possibilities in applications including gas&#8208;permeable and water&#8208;repellent microfluidics, as well as hierarchically structured super oil absorbents.








Abstract
The rapid development of 3D printing (or additive manufacturing) technologies demands new materials with novel properties and functionalities. Superhydrophobic materials, owing to their ultralow water adhesion, self&#8208;cleaning, anti&#8208;biofouling, or superoleophilic properties are useful for myriad applications involving liquids. However, the majority of the methods for making superhydrophobic surfaces have been based on surface functionalization and coatings, which are challenging to apply to 3D objects. Additionally, these coatings are vulnerable to abrasion due to low mechanical stability and limited thickness. Here, a new materials concept and methodology for 3D printing of superhydrophobic macroscopic objects with bulk nanostructure and almost unlimited geometrical freedom is presented. The method is based on a specific ink composed of hydrophobic (meth)acrylate monomers and porogen solvents, which undergoes phase separation upon photopolymerization to generate inherently nanoporous and superhydrophobic structures. Using a desktop Digital Light Processing printer, superhydrophobic 3D objects with complex shapes are demonstrated, with ultralow and uniform water adhesion measured with scanning droplet adhesion microscopy. It is shown that the 3D&#8208;printed objects, owing to their nanoporous structure throughout the entire volume, preserve their superhydrophobicity upon wear damage. Finally, a superhydrophobic 3D&#8208;printed gas&#8208;permeable and water&#8208;repellent microfluidic device and a hierarchically structured 3D&#8208;printed super&#8208;oil&#8208;absorbent are demonstrated.

         <title>High Energy Density Solid State Lithium Metal Batteries Enabled by Sub&#8208;5 &#181;m Solid Polymer Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thin, solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) are crucial to improve cell energy density. However, limited oxide stability and weak strength hinder the application of ultrathin SSEs. In this work, an ultrathin bilayer SSE with porous ceramic scaffold inside is proposed to simultaneously enlarge the electrochemical window and improve the mechanical strength. High&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;metal batteries are also demonstrated.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) are considered as the most promising next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy storage devices due to their ability in addressing the safety concerns from organic electrolytes and enabling energy dense lithium anodes. To ensure the high energy density of SSBs, solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) are required to be thin and light&#8208;weight, and simultaneously offer a wide electrochemical window to pair with high&#8208;voltage cathodes. However, the decrease of SSE thickness and delicate structure may increase the cell safety risks, which is detrimental for the practical application of SSBs. Herein, to demonstrate a high&#8208;energy&#8208;density SSB with sufficient safety insurance, an ultrathin (4.2 &#181;m) bilayer SSE with porous ceramic scaffold and double&#8208;layer Li+&#8208;conducting polymer, is proposed. The fire&#8208;resistant and stiff ceramic scaffold improves the safety capability and mechanical strength of the composite SSE, and the bilayer polymer structure enhances the compatibility of Li metal anode and high&#8208;voltage cathodes. The 3D ceramic facilitates Li&#8208;ion conduction and regulates Li deposition. Thus, high energy density of 506&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 1514&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 is achieved based on LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathodes with a low N/P ratio and long lifespan over 3000 h. High&#8208;energy&#8208;density anode&#8208;free cells are further demonstrated.

         <title>Heterogeneous Functional Dielectric Patterns for Charge&#8208;Carrier Modulation in Ultraflexible Organic Integrated Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulating the behavior of charge carriers in respective transistors on the same substrate is essential in maximizing the performance of organic integrated circuits (ICs). Heterogeneous functional dielectric patterns for charge&#8208;carrier modulation are obtained by UV patterning. Consequently, the threshold voltage is precisely controlled within the 2&#8211;4&#160;V operational range. Furthermore, these ultraflexible organic ICs exhibit the highest performance.








Abstract
Flexible electronics have gained considerable attention for application in wearable devices. Organic transistors are potential candidates to develop flexible integrated circuits (ICs). A primary technique for maximizing their reliability, gain, and operation speed is the modulation of charge&#8208;carrier behavior in the respective transistors fabricated on the same substrate. In this work, heterogeneous functional dielectric patterns (HFDP) of ultrathin polymer gate dielectrics of poly((&#177;)endo,exo&#8208;bicyclo[2.2.1]hept&#8208;ene&#8208;2,3&#8208;dicarboxylic acid, diphenylester) (PNDPE) are introduced. The HFDP that are obtained via the photo&#8208;Fries rearrangement by ultraviolet radiation in the homogeneous PNDPE provide a functional area for charge&#8208;carrier modulation. This leads to programmable threshold voltage control over a wide range (&#8722;1.5 to +0.2&#160;V) in the transistors with a high patterning resolution, at 2&#160;V operational voltage. The transistors also exhibit high operational stability over 140 days and under the bias&#8208;stress duration of 1800&#160;s. With the HFDP, the performance metrics of ICs, for example, the noise margin and gain of the zero&#8208;VGS load inverters and the oscillation frequency of ring oscillators are improved to 80%, 1200, and 2.5&#160;kHz, respectively, which are the highest among the previously reported zero&#8208;VGS&#8208;based organic circuits. The HFDP can be applied to much complex and ultraflexible ICs.

A large&#8208;area optoelectronic neuromorphic system demonstrates the hardware training of random images using multispectral light signals. It provides the first demonstration of a monolithically integrated and scalable optoelectronic neuromorphic devices composed of a heterostructure phototransistor and circuit component with standard complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) processing, which is capable of efficient pattern recognition by the fully optically derived signals.








Abstract
The complete hardware implementation of an optoelectronic neuromorphic computing system is considered as one of the most promising solutions to realize energy&#8208;efficient artificial intelligence. Here, a fully light&#8208;driven and scalable optoelectronic neuromorphic circuit with metal&#8208;chalcogenide/metal&#8208;oxide heterostructure phototransistor and photovoltaic divider is proposed. To achieve wavelength&#8208;selective neural operation and hardware&#8208;based pattern recognition, multispectral light modulated bidirectional synaptic circuits are utilized as an individual pixel for highly accurate and large&#8208;area neuromorphic computing system. The wavelength selective control of photo&#8208;generated charges at the heterostructure interface enables the bidirectional synaptic modulation behaviors including the excitatory and inhibitory modulations. More importantly, a 7 &#215; 7 neuromorphic pixel circuit array is demonstrated to show the viability of implementing highly accurate hardware&#8208;based pattern training. In both the pixel training and pattern recognition simulation, the neuromorphic circuit array with the bidirectional synaptic modulation exhibits lower training errors and higher recognition rates, respectively.

         <title>Sono&#8208;Controllable and ROS&#8208;Sensitive CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 Genome Editing for Augmented/Synergistic Ultrasound Tumor Nanotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel avenue to circumvent the resistance of tumor cells in conventional sonodynamic therapy is pioneered in this work, where targeted delivery and controllable release of the cluster regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat&#8208;associated protein system is also achieved.








Abstract
The potential of the cluster regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)&#8208;associated protein 9 (Cas9)&#8208;based therapeutic genome editing is severely hampered by the difficulties in precise regulation of the in vivo activity of the CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 system. Herein, sono&#8208;controllable and reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;sensitive sonosensitizer&#8208;integrated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), denoted as P/M@CasMTH1, are developed for augmented sonodynamic therapy (SDT) efficacy using the genome&#8208;editing technology. P/M@CasMTH1 nanoparticles comprise singlet oxygen (1O2)&#8208;generating MOF structures anchored with CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 systems via 1O2&#8208;cleavable linkers, which serve not only as a delivery vector of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 targeting MTH1, but also as a sonoregulator to spatiotemporally activate the genome editing. P/M@CasMTH1 escapes from the lysosomes, harvests the ultrasound (US) energy and converts it into abundant 1O2 to induce SDT. The generated ROS subsequently trigger cleavage of ROS&#8208;responsive thioether bonds, thus inducing controllable release of the CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 system and initiation of genome editing. The genomic disruption of MTH1 conspicuously augments the therapeutic efficacy of SDT by destroying the self&#8208;defense system in tumor cells, thereby causing cellular apoptosis and tumor suppression. This therapeutic strategy for synergistic MTH1 disruption and abundant 1O2 generation provides a paradigm for augmenting SDT efficacy based on the emerging nanomedicine&#8208;enabled genome&#8208;editing technology.

         <title>Ubiquitination Flow Repressors: Enhancing Wound Healing of Infectious Diabetic Ulcers through Stabilization of Polyubiquitinated Hypoxia&#8208;Inducible Factor&#8208;1&#945; by Theranostic Nitric Oxide Nanogenerators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A subcutaneous injectable near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;triggered theranostic nitric oxide nanogenerator is bioengineered to maintain hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; (HIF&#8208;1&#945;) stability by repressing ubiquitination&#8208;mediated protein degradation and promote diabetic ulcer healing. This nanogenerator is also capable of early detection and elimination of wound infections.








Abstract
Current treatments for diabetic ulcers (DUs) remain unsatisfactory due to the risk of bacterial infection and impaired angiogenesis during the healing process. The increased degradation of polyubiquitinated hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; (HIF&#8208;1&#945;) compromises wound healing efficacy. Therefore, the maintenance of HIF&#8208;1&#945; protein stability might help treat DU. Nitric oxide (NO) is an intrinsic biological messenger that functions as a ubiquitination flow repressor and antibacterial agent; however, its clinical application in DU treatment is hindered by the difficulty in controlling NO release. Here, an intelligent near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;triggered NO nanogenerator (SNP@MOF&#8208;UCNP@ssPDA&#8208;Cy7/IR786s, abbreviated as SNP@UCM) is presented. SNP@UCM represses ubiquitination&#8208;mediated proteasomal degradation of HIF&#8208;1&#945; by inhibiting its interaction with E3 ubiquitin ligases under NIR irradiation. Increased HIF&#8208;1&#945; expression in endothelial cells by SNP@UCM enhances angiogenesis in wound sites, promoting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion and cell proliferation and migration. SNP@UCM also enables early detection of wound infections and ROS&#8208;mediated killing of bacteria. The potential clinical utility of SNP@UCM is further demonstrated in infected full&#8208;thickness DU model under NIR irradiation. SNP@UCM is the first reported HIF&#8208;1&#945;&#8208;stabilizing advanced nanomaterial, and further materials engineering might offer a facile, mechanism&#8208;based method for clinical DU management.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Interactive Fiber Electronics with Visual&#8211;Digital Synergies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bimodal fiber electronics that can simultaneously visualize and digitize mechanical stimulus without an external power supply is presented. The novel visual&#8211;digital synergies mechanism endows the fiber electronics with excellent optical and electrical performance, and new temporal&#8211;spatial resolution. Industrial&#8208;level scalable manufacture and recycling are thoroughly demonstrated. This bimodal fiber electronics shows unique application in human&#8211;machine interfaces and underwater sensing.








Abstract
Fiber electronics with mechanosensory functionality are highly desirable in healthcare, human&#8211;machine interfaces, and robotics. Most efforts are committed to optimize the electronically readable interface of fiber mechanoreceptor, while the user interface based on naked&#8208;eye readable output is rarely explored. Here, a scalable fiber electronics that can simultaneously visualize and digitize the mechanical stimulus without external power supply, named self&#8208;powered optoelectronic synergistic fiber sensors (SOEFSs), are reported. By coupling of space and surface charge polarization, a new mechanoluminescent (ML)&#8208;triboelectric synergistic effect is realized. It contributes to remarkable enhancement of both electrical (by 100%) and optical output (by 30%), as well as novel temporal&#8211;spatial resolution mode for motion capturing. Based on entirely new thermoplastic ML material system and spinning process, industrial&#8208;level continuously manufacture and recycling processes of SOEFS are realized. Furthermore, SOEFSs&#8217; application in human&#8211;machine interface, virtual reality, and underwater sensing, rescue, and information interaction is demonstrated.

         <title>Nickelate Superconductivity without Rare&#8208;Earth Magnetism: (La,Sr)NiO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By refining the synthesis of high&#8208;quality thin films, a superconducting dome is observed in La1&#8722;xSrxNiO2. Perhaps more surprisingly, undoped LaNiO2 also shows a strong indication of superconductivity. A generalized superconducting dome can be obtained by combining the La/Pr/Nd systems, revealing systematic shifts in the unit cell volume and the relative electron&#8211;hole population across the lanthanides.








Abstract
The occurrence of unconventional superconductivity in cuprates has long motivated the search for manifestations in other layered transition metal oxides. Recently, superconductivity is found in infinite&#8208;layer nickelate (Nd,Sr)NiO2 and (Pr,Sr)NiO2 thin films, formed by topotactic reduction from the perovskite precursor phase. A topic of much current interest is whether rare&#8208;earth moments are essential for superconductivity in this system. In this study, it is found that with significant materials optimization, substantial portions of the La1&#8722;xSrxNiO2 phase diagram can enter the regime of coherent low&#8208;temperature transport (x&#160;= 0.14 &#8208; 0.20), with subsequent superconducting transitions and a maximum onset of &#8776;9 K at x&#160;= 0.20. Additionally, the unexpected indication of a superconducting ground state in undoped LaNiO2 is observed, which likely reflects the self&#8208;doped nature of the electronic structure. Combining the results of (La/Pr/Nd)1&#8722;xSrxNiO2 reveals a generalized superconducting dome, characterized by systematic shifts in the unit cell volume and in the relative electron&#8208;hole populations across the lanthanides.

2D amorphous MoS3&#8208;on&#8208;rGO heterostructure is constructed via an isotropic growth process for beyond&#8208;lithium&#8208;ion batteries (Na+, K+, and Zn2+) with outstanding electrochemical performance and superior cyclic stability. The amorphous MoS3&#8208;on&#8208;rGO exhibits low strain and fast reaction kinetics during cycling.








Abstract
Beyond&#8208;lithium&#8208;ion storage devices are promising alternatives to lithium&#8208;ion storage devices for low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale applications. Nowadays, the most of high&#8208;capacity electrodes are crystal materials. However, these crystal materials with intrinsic anisotropy feature generally suffer from lattice strain and structure pulverization during the electrochemical process. Herein, a 2D heterostructure of amorphous molybdenum sulfide (MoS3) on reduced graphene surface (denoted as MoS3&#8208;on&#8208;rGO), which exhibits low strain and fast reaction kinetics for beyond&#8208;lithium&#8208;ions (Na+, K+, Zn2+) storage is demonstrated. Benefiting from the low volume expansion and small sodiation strain of the MoS3&#8208;on&#8208;rGO, it displays ultralong cycling performance of 40&#8201;000&#160;cycles at 10&#160;A g&#8722;1 for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Furthermore, the as&#8208;constructed 2D heterostructure also delivers superior electrochemical performance when used in Na+ full batteries, solid&#8208;state sodium batteries, K+ batteries, Zn2+ batteries and hybrid supercapacitors, demonstrating its excellent application prospect.

         <title>Polydopamine Nanobottles with Photothermal Capability for Controlled Release and Related Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polydopamine nanobottles with strong optical absorption are fabricated and then explored as a versatile platform for the encapsulation and controlled release of various types of cargos, including small molecules and biomacromolecules.








Abstract
Nanobottles refer to colloidal particles featuring a hollow body connected to a single opening on the surface. This unique feature makes them ideal carriers for the encapsulation and controlled release of various types of cargos. Here a facile route to the fabrication of uniform nanobottles made of polydopamine by leveraging swelling&#8208;induced pressure is reported. When polystyrene spheres are coated with polydopamine and then incubated with a toluene/water emulsion, the polystyrene will be swollen to automatically poke a single hole in the shell because of the pressure inside the shell. After quenching the swelling with ethanol and then removing all the polystyrene with tetrahydrofuran, polydopamine nanobottles are obtained. The dimensions of the hollow body are determined by the polystyrene template, while the size of the opening can be tuned by varying the shell thickness. Through the opening, different types of cargos, including small molecules and biomacromolecules, can be easily loaded with a thermoresponsive material into the cavity. The cargos can be released in a controllable manner through direct heating or polydopamine&#8208;enabled photothermal heating. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment, the polydopamine nanobottles are used for temperature&#8208;controlled release of thrombin to trigger the formation of fibrin gels in situ.

         <title>Codes in Code: AIE Supramolecular Adhesive Hydrogels Store Huge Amounts of Information</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of AIE supramolecular adhesive hydrogels showing different fluorescent colors and the use of a &#8220;Codes in Code&#8221; method, incorporating 1D barcode or/and 2D code patterns into a 3D code pattern, to demonstrate the storage capacity of large amounts of information, are reported. This study realizes a great improvement of the storage capacity of information code materials.








Abstract
With the continuous advancement of information technology, the requirements for the information storage capacity of materials are getting higher and higher. However, information code materials usually only store a single piece of information. In order to improve their storage capacity, aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) supramolecular adhesive hydrogels with different fluorescent colors are prepared, and a &#8220;Codes in Code&#8221; method is used to demonstrate the storage capacity for large amounts of information. Four kinds of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) supramolecular hydrogels with different fluorescent colors are prepared; based on the hydrogen bonds on the hydrogel surface, these hydrogels can be assembled into a hydrogel, G5, which shows multiple fluorescent colors under the irradiation of UV light. When many 1D barcode patterns or/and 2D code patterns are incorporated into G5, not only a kind of 3D information but also plenty of 1D or/and 2D information can be stored. Therefore, the information codes prepared by the &#8220;Codes in Code&#8221; method can store a large amount of information.

         <title>Electrical Generation and Deletion of Magnetic Skyrmion&#8208;Bubbles via Vertical Current Injection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new route to generate and delete magnetic skyrmion&#8208;bubbles electrically is presented using a vertical current path. The vertical current path concept is easy to integrate with a widely used spin&#8211;orbit torque device. Using the vertical current path with a spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;torque device, core operations for a skyrmion racetrack memory device in a three&#8208;terminal device are demonstrated.








Abstract
The magnetic skyrmion is a topologically protected spin texture that has attracted much attention as a promising information carrier because of its distinct features of suitability for high&#8208;density storage, low power consumption, and stability. One of the skyrmion devices proposed so far is the skyrmion racetrack memory, which is the skyrmion version of the domain&#8208;wall racetrack memory. For application in devices, skyrmion racetrack memory requires electrical generation, deletion, and displacement of isolated skyrmions. Despite the progress in experimental demonstrations of skyrmion generation, deletion, and displacement, these three operations have yet to be realized in one device. Here, a route for generating and deleting isolated skyrmion&#8208;bubbles through vertical current injection with an explanation of its microscopic origin is presented. By combining the proposed skyrmion&#8208;bubble generation/deletion method with the spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;torque&#8208;driven skyrmion shift, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experimental demonstration of the skyrmion racetrack memory operation in a three&#8208;terminal device structure is provided.

         <title>Impact of Nanoscale Morphology on Charge Carrier Delocalization and Mobility in an Organic Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hole carrier wavefunction is propagated through samples of pentacene with varying levels of structural disorder using surface hopping non&#8208;adiabatic molecular dynamics. It is found that charge carriers are more delocalized, that is, more &#8220;quantum&#8221; than previously thought, even for relatively disordered samples, and the mechanism of charge transport as a function of crystallinity is established.








Abstract
A central challenge of organic semiconductor research is to make cheap, disordered materials that exhibit high electrical conductivity. Unfortunately, this endeavor is hampered by the poor fundamental understanding of the relationship between molecular packing structure and charge carrier mobility. Here a novel computational methodology is presented that fills this gap. Using a melt&#8208;quench procedure it is shown that amorphous pentacene spontaneously self&#8208;assembles to nanocrystalline structures that, at long quench times, form the characteristic herringbone layer of the single crystal. Quantum dynamical simulations of electron hole transport show a clear correlation between the crystallinity of the sample, the quantum delocalization, and the mobility of the charge carrier. Surprisingly, the long&#8208;held belief that charge carriers form relatively localized polarons in disordered OS is only valid for fully amorphous structures&#8212;for nanocrystalline and crystalline samples, significant charge carrier delocalization over several nanometers occurs that underpins their improved conductivities. The good agreement with experimentally available data makes the presented methodology a robust computational tool for the predictive engineering of disordered organic materials.

Unfortunately, this endeavor is hampered by the poor fundamental understanding of the relationship between molecular packing structure and charge carrier mobility. Here a novel computational methodology is presented that fills this gap. Using a melt-quench procedure it is shown that amorphous pentacene spontaneously self-assembles to nanocrystalline structures that, at long quench times, form the characteristic herringbone layer of the single crystal. Quantum dynamical simulations of electron hole transport show a clear correlation between the crystallinity of the sample, the quantum delocalization, and the mobility of the charge carrier. Surprisingly, the long-held belief that charge carriers form relatively localized polarons in disordered OS is only valid for fully amorphous structures&#8212;for nanocrystalline and crystalline samples, significant charge carrier delocalization over several nanometers occurs that underpins their improved conductivities. The good agreement with experimentally available data makes the presented methodology a robust computational tool for the predictive engineering of disordered organic materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient and Spectrally Stable Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Employing a Cationic &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorene&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated cationic polymer as a multifunctional passivator to suppress non&#8208;radiative processes, improve charge transport properties, and inhibit ion migration for blue mixed&#8208;halide perovskite semiconductors, is reported. As a result, efficient and spectrally stable blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes with emission wavelengths from 485 to 458 nm are achieved.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite semiconductors have demonstrated remarkable potentials in solution&#8208;processed blue light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). However, the unsatisfied efficiency and spectral stability responsible for trap&#8208;mediated non&#8208;radiative losses and halide phase segregation remain the primary unsolved challenges for blue perovskite LEDs. In this study, it is reported that a fluorene&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated cationic polymer can be blended with the perovskite semiconductor to control film formation and optoelectronic properties. As a result, sky&#8208;blue and true&#8208;blue perovskite LEDs with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage coordinates of (0.08, 0.22) and (0.12, 0.13) at the record external quantum efficiencies of 11.2% and 8.0% were&#160;achieved. In addition, the mixed halide perovskites with the conjugated cationic polymer exhibit excellent spectral stability under external bias. This result illustrates that &#960;&#8208;conjugated cationic polymers have a great potential to realize efficient blue mixed&#8208;halide perovskite LEDs with stable electroluminescence.

         <title>A Liquid Metal Mediated Metallic Coating for Antimicrobial and Antiviral Fabrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple method to coat metallic particles on fibers is reported. Liquid metal (LM), gallium particles serve as an adhesive nucleation layer to reduce copper ions into metallic copper via galvanic replacement. The liquid&#8208;metal&#8211;copper (LMCu) particles have excellent antimicrobial and antiviral activity against a wide range of bacteria, fungi, and influenza and corona viruses.








Abstract
Fabrics are widely used in hospitals and many other settings for bedding, clothing, and face masks; however, microbial pathogens can survive on surfaces for a long time, leading to microbial transmission. Coatings of metallic particles on fabrics have been widely used to eradicate pathogens. However, current metal particle coating technologies encounter numerous issues such as nonuniformity, processing complexity, and poor adhesion. To overcome these issues, an easy&#8208;to&#8208;control and straightforward method is reported to coat a wide range of fabrics by using gallium liquid metal (LM) particles to facilitate the deposition of liquid metal copper alloy (LMCu) particles. Gallium particles coated on the fabric provide nucleation sites for forming LMCu particles at room temperature via galvanic replacement of Cu2+ ions. The LM helps promote strong adhesion of the particles to the fabric. The presence of the LMCu particles can eradicate over 99% of pathogens (including bacteria, fungi, and viruses) within 5&#160;min, which is significantly more effective than control samples coated with only Cu. The coating remains effective over multiple usages and against contaminated droplets and aerosols, such as those encountered in facemasks. This facile coating method is promising for generating robust antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral fabrics and surfaces.

         <title>Electro&#8208;Optic Activity in Excess of 1000 pm V&#8722;1 Achieved via Theory&#8208;Guided Organic Chromophore Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using theory&#8208;guided design, a new series of organic electro&#8208;optic chromophores is demonstrated, based on strong bis(4&#8208;dialkylaminophenyl)phenylamino electron&#8208;donating groups. Density functional theory modeling and hyper&#8208;Rayleigh scattering measurements confirm large improvements in hyperpolarizability. The best electro&#8208;optic coefficient (r33&#160;= 1100&#160;&#177; 100 pm V&#8722;1) is nearly twice as high as the previous best example and higher than for thin&#8208;film barium titanate.








Abstract
High performance organic electro&#8208;optic (OEO) materials enable ultrahigh bandwidth, small footprint, and extremely low drive voltage in silicon&#8208;organic hybrid and plasmonic&#8208;organic hybrid photonic devices. However, practical OEO materials under device&#8208;relevant conditions are generally limited to performance of &#8776;300 pm V&#8722;1 (10&#215; the EO response of lithium niobate). By means of theory&#8208;guided design, a new series of OEO chromophores is demonstrated, based on strong bis(4&#8208;dialkylaminophenyl)phenylamino electron donating groups, capable of EO coefficients (r33) in excess of 1000 pm V&#8722;1. Density functional theory modeling and hyper&#8208;Rayleigh scattering measurements are performed and confirm the large improvement in hyperpolarizability due to the stronger donor. The EO performance of the exemplar chromophore in the series, BAY1, is evaluated neat and at various concentrations in polymer host and shows a nearly linear increase in r33 and poling efficiency (r33/Ep, Ep is poling field) with increasing chromophore concentration. 25 wt% BAY1/polymer composite shows a higher poling efficiency (3.9&#160;&#177; 0.1 nm2 V&#8722;2) than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art neat chromophores. Using a high&#8208;&#949; charge blocking layer with BAY1, a record&#8208;high r33 (1100&#160;&#177; 100 pm V&#8722;1) and poling efficiency (17.8&#160;&#177; 0.8&#160;nm2 V&#8722;2) at 1310&#160;nm are achieved. This is the first reported OEO material with electro&#8208;optic response larger than thin&#8208;film barium titanate.

         <title>Calcium Phosphate&#8208;Reinforced Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Regulate Adenosine&#8208;Mediated Immunosuppression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium&#8208;phosphate&#8208;reinforced iron&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (CaP@Fe&#8208;MOFs) are designed to reduce adenosine accumulation and to inhibit adenosine&#8208;mediated immunosuppressive response. CaP@Fe&#8208;MOFs regulate the adenosine metabolism by promoting adenosine&#8208;kinase&#8208;mediated phosphorylation and relieving the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Moreover, CaP@Fe&#8208;MOFs enhance the antitumor immune response via adenosine regulation, including the increase of T lymphocytes and dendritic cells and the decrease of regulatory T lymphocytes.








Abstract
Long&#8208;term accumulation of adenosine (Ado) in tumor tissues helps to establish the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and to promote tumor development. Regulation of Ado metabolism is particularly pivotal for blocking Ado&#8208;mediated immunosuppression. The activity of adenosine kinase (ADK) for catalyzing the phosphorylation of Ado plays an essential role in regulating Ado metabolism. Specifically, accumulated Ado in the tumor microenvironment occupies the active site of ADK, inhibiting the phosphorylation of Ado. Phosphate can protect ADK from inactivation and restore the activity of ADK. Herein, calcium phosphate&#8208;reinforced iron&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (CaP@Fe&#8208;MOFs) are designed to reduce Ado accumulation and to inhibit Ado&#8208;mediated immunosuppressive response in the tumor microenvironment. CaP@Fe&#8208;MOFs are found to regulate the Ado metabolism by promoting ADK&#8208;mediated phosphorylation and relieving the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Moreover, CaP@Fe&#8208;MOFs can enhance the antitumor immune response via Ado regulation, including the increase of T lymphocytes and dendritic cells and the decrease of regulatory T lymphocytes. Finally, CaP@Fe&#8208;MOFs are used for cancer treatment in mice, alleviating the Ado&#8208;mediated immunosuppressive response and achieving tumor suppression. This study may offer a general strategy for blocking the Ado&#8208;mediated immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment and further for enhancing the immunotherapy efficacy in vivo.

&lt;p&gt;Long-term accumulation of adenosine (Ado) in tumor tissues helps to establish the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and to promote tumor development. Regulation of Ado metabolism is particularly pivotal for blocking Ado-mediated immunosuppression. The activity of adenosine kinase (ADK) for catalyzing the phosphorylation of Ado plays an essential role in regulating Ado metabolism. Specifically, accumulated Ado in the tumor microenvironment occupies the active site of ADK, inhibiting the phosphorylation of Ado. Phosphate can protect ADK from inactivation and restore the activity of ADK. Herein, calcium phosphate-reinforced iron-based metal-organic frameworks (CaP@Fe-MOFs) are designed to reduce Ado accumulation and to inhibit Ado-mediated immunosuppressive response in the tumor microenvironment. CaP@Fe-MOFs are found to regulate the Ado metabolism by promoting ADK-mediated phosphorylation and relieving the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Moreover, CaP@Fe-MOFs can enhance the antitumor immune response via Ado regulation, including the increase of T lymphocytes and dendritic cells and the decrease of regulatory T lymphocytes. Finally, CaP@Fe-MOFs are used for cancer treatment in mice, alleviating the Ado-mediated immunosuppressive response and achieving tumor suppression. This study may offer a general strategy for blocking the Ado-mediated immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment and further for enhancing the immunotherapy efficacy in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Epitaxial Film Growth of van der Waals Ferromagnetic Ternary Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D magnetic crystals constitute ideal platforms to experimentally access the fundamental physics of magnetism and achieve magneto&#8208;optical and magneto&#8208;electric devices for future electronics. In this work, a new generalized synthetic concept for producing wafer&#8208;scale epitaxial thin films of 2D ferromagnetic ternary chalcogenide crystals is described. The growth process utilizes commercial wafers (Ge, Si) as a metal source as well as epitaxy provider.








Abstract
Following the first experimental realization of intrinsic ferromagnetism in 2D van der Waals (vdW) crystals, several ternary metal chalcogenides with unprecedented long&#8208;range ferromagnetic order have been explored. However, the synthesis of large&#8208;area 2D ternary metal chalcogenide thin films is a great challenge, and a generalized synthesis has not been demonstrated yet. Here, a quick and scalable synthesis of epitaxially aligned ferromagnetic ternary metal chalcogenide thin films (Cr2Ge2Te6, Cr2Si2Te6, Mn3Si2Te6) is reported. The synthesis is based on the flux&#8208;controlled surface diffusion of Te on metal (Cr, Mn)&#8208;deposited wafer (Ge, Si) substrates. Magnetic anisotropy study of the epitaxial ternary thin films reveals the intrinsic magnetic easy axis; out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction for Cr2Ge2Te6 and Cr2Si2Te6, and in&#8208;plane direction for Mn3Si2Te6. In addition to the synthesis, this work creates an opportunity for transfer&#8208;free device fabrication for realizing magnetoelectronics based on the electrical control of both charge and spin degrees of freedom in 2D ferromagnetic semiconductors.

         <title>An Amorphous Peri&#8208;Implant Ligament with Combined Osteointegration and Energy&#8208;Dissipation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired peri&#8208;implant ligament (PIL) is realized using polymer&#8208;infiltrated amorphous titania nanotubes based on a periodontium&#8208;mimetic architecture. The PIL not only provides exceptional osteoinductivity by more than 18% bone&#8211;implant contact, but also remarkably reduces stress transfer to the peri&#8208;implant bone by &#8776;30% as compared to titanium. The PIL will open new possibilities for developing high&#8208;performance implant materials with increased lifespans.








Abstract
Progress toward developing metal implants as permanent hard&#8208;tissue substitutes requires both osteointegration to achieve load&#8208;bearing support, and energy&#8208;dissipation to prevent overload&#8208;induced bone resorption. However, in existing implants these two properties can only be achieved separately. Optimized by natural evolution, tooth&#8208;periodontal&#8208;ligaments with fiber&#8208;bundle structures can efficiently orchestrate load&#8208;bearing and energy dissipation, which make tooth&#8211;bone complexes survive extremely high occlusion loads (&gt;300 N) for prolonged lifetimes. Here, a bioinspired peri&#8208;implant ligament with simultaneously enhanced osteointegration and energy&#8208;dissipation is presented, which is based on the periodontium&#8208;mimetic architecture of a polymer&#8208;infiltrated, amorphous, titania nanotube array. The artificial ligament not only provides exceptional osteoinductivity owing to its nanotopography and beneficial ingredients, but also produces periodontium&#8208;similar energy dissipation due to the complexity of the force transmission modes and interface sliding. The ligament increases bone&#8211;implant contact by more than 18% and simultaneously reduces the effective stress transfer from implant to peri&#8208;implant bone by &#8776;30% as compared to titanium implants, which as far as is known has not previously been achieved. It is anticipated that the concept of an artificial ligament will open new possibilities for developing high&#8208;performance implanted materials with increased lifespans.

         <title>Molecule&#8208;Upgraded van der Waals Contacts for Schottky&#8208;Barrier&#8208;Free Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upgraded van der Waals metal&#8211;semiconductor contacts with near&#8208;zero Schottky barrier are realized by a stable, efficient, and non&#8208;residue molecule treatment of reducing the Schottky barrier width, to enable record&#8208;setting performance metrics of atomically thin transistors.








Abstract
The applications of any ultrathin semiconductor device are inseparable from high&#8208;quality metal&#8211;semiconductor contacts with designed Schottky barriers. Building van der Waals (vdWs) contacts of 2D semiconductors represents an advanced strategy of lowering the Schottky barrier height by reducing interface states, but will finally fail at the theoretical minimum barrier due to the inevitable energy difference between the semiconductor electron affinity and the metal work function. Here, an effective molecule optimization strategy is reported to upgrade the general vdWs contacts, achieving near&#8208;zero Schottky barriers and creating high&#8208;performance electronic devices. The molecule treatment can induce the defect healing effect in p&#8208;type semiconductors and further enhance the hole density, leading to an effectively thinned Schottky barrier width and improved carrier interface transmission efficiency. With an ultrathin Schottky barrier width of &#8776;2.17&#160;nm and outstanding contact resistance of &#8776;9 k&#937;&#160;&#181;m in the optimized Au/WSe2 contacts, an ultrahigh field&#8208;effect mobility of &#8776;148&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in chemical vapor deposition grown WSe2 flakes is achieved. Unlike conventional chemical treatments, this molecule upgradation strategy leaves no residue and displays a high&#8208;temperature stability at &gt;200 &#176;C. Furthermore, the Schottky barrier optimization is generalized to other metal&#8211;semiconductor contacts, including 1T&#8208;PtSe2/WSe2, 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoTe2/WSe2, 2H&#8208;NbS2/WSe2, and Au/PdSe2, defining a simple, universal, and scalable method to minimize contact resistance.

         <title>AIEgen&#8208;Based Lifetime&#8208;Probes for Precise Furin Quantification and Identification of Cell Subtypes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission luminogen (AIEgen)&#8208;based PyTPA&#8208;ZGO probe with three lifetime signals is proposed for precise furin quantification, including signal 1 of AIEgen (&#964;Pn), signal 2 of inorganic nanoparticles (&#964;Zn), and signal 3 as the composite dual&#8208;lifetime signal (CDLSn). Furthermore, CDLSn exhibits higher accuracy than &#964;Pn and &#964;Zn in identifying cell subtypes based on the specific furin concentration in each subtype.








Abstract
Biochemical sensing probes based on aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission luminogens (AIEgens) are widely used in biological imaging and therapy, chemical sensing, and material sciences. However, it is still a great challenge to quantify the targets through fluorescence intensity of AIEgen probes due to their undesirable aggregations. Here, a PyTPA&#8208;ZGO probe with three lifetime signals for precise quantification of furin is constructed: the lifetime signal 1 and signal 2 comes from AIEgen PyTPA&#8208;P (&#964;Pn) and inorganic nanoparticles Zn2GeO4:Mn2+&#8208;NH2 (&#964;Zn), respectively, while the lifetime signal 3 is marked as the composite dual&#8208;lifetime signal (CDLSn, CDLSn=&#964;Zn&#964;Pn). In contrast, the fluorescence intensity signal of PyTPA&#8208;P shows defectively quantitative performance. Furthermore, it is found that the CDLSn exhibits higher significant differences than the two other lifetime signals (&#964;Pn and &#964;Zn) thanks to its wide range between the maximum and minimum signal values and small standard deviation. Therefore, CDLSn is further used to accurately identify cell subtypes based on the specific concentration of furin in each subtype. The lifetime criterion can realize precise quantification, and it should be a promising direction of AIEgen&#8208;based quantitative analysis in the future.

   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;), and signal 3 as the composite dual-lifetime signal (CDLS&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;). Furthermore, CDLS&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits higher accuracy than &#964;&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; and &#964;&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; in identifying cell subtypes based on the specific furin concentration in each subtype.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biochemical sensing probes based on aggregation-induced-emission luminogens (AIEgens) are widely used in biological imaging and therapy, chemical sensing, and material sciences. However, it is still a great challenge to quantify the targets through fluorescence intensity of AIEgen probes due to their undesirable aggregations. Here, a PyTPA-ZGO probe with three lifetime signals for precise quantification of furin is constructed: the lifetime signal 1 and signal 2 comes from AIEgen PyTPA-P (&#964;&lt;sub&gt;Pn&lt;/sub&gt;) and inorganic nanoparticles Zn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;GeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;:Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&#964;&lt;sub&gt;Zn&lt;/sub&gt;), respectively, while the lifetime signal 3 is marked as the composite dual-lifetime signal (CDLS&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, CDLSn=&#964;Zn&#964;Pn). In contrast, the fluorescence intensity signal of PyTPA-P shows defectively quantitative performance. Furthermore, it is found that the CDLS&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits higher significant differences than the two other lifetime signals (&#964;&lt;sub&gt;Pn&lt;/sub&gt; and &#964;&lt;sub&gt;Zn&lt;/sub&gt;) thanks to its wide range between the maximum and minimum signal values and small standard deviation. Therefore, CDLS&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is further used to accurately identify cell subtypes based on the specific concentration of furin in each subtype. The lifetime criterion can realize precise quantification, and it should be a promising direction of AIEgen-based quantitative analysis in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tomoscopy: Time&#8208;Resolved Tomography for Dynamic Processes in Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments of time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray tomography, called &#8220;tomoscopy,&#8221; are presented. Tomoscopy provides up to 1000 tomograms per second at &#181;m&#8208;range resolution, running experiments for minutes without interruption. Tomoscopy is applied to study various dynamic processes in materials science.








Abstract
The structure and constitution of opaque materials can be studied with X&#8208;ray imaging methods such as 3D tomography. To observe the dynamic evolution of their structure and the distribution of constituents, for example, during processing, heating, mechanical loading, etc., 3D imaging has to be fast enough. In this paper, the recent developments of time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray tomography that have led to what one now calls &#8220;tomoscopy&#8221; are briefly reviewed A novel setup is presented and applied that pushes temporal resolution down to just 1&#160;ms, that is, 1000&#160;tomograms per second (tps) are acquired, while maintaining spatial resolutions of micrometers and running experiments for minutes without interruption. Applications recorded at different acquisition rates ranging from 50 to 1000&#160;tps are presented. The authors observe and quantify the immiscible hypermonotectic reaction of AlBi10 (in wt%) alloy and dendrite evolution in AlGe10 (in wt%) casting alloy during fast solidification. The combustion process and the evolution of the constituents are analyzed in a burning sparkler. Finally, the authors follow the structure and density of two metal foams over a long period of time and derive details of bubble formation and bubble ageing including quantitative analyses of bubble parameters with millisecond temporal resolution.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Free siRNA Micelles as Effective Drug Delivery Platform and Potent RNAi Nanomedicines for Glioblastoma Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The siRNA micelle not only acts as a spherical nucleic acid that is able to cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and enter tumor cells, but also is capable of delivering chemical drugs into brain tumors. This multifunction endows siRNA micelles with great potential as an RNAi nanomedicine or drug delivery platform for glioblastoma therapy.








Abstract
Nanoparticle&#8208;based small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapy shows great promise for glioblastoma (GBM). However, charge associated toxicity and limited blood&#8211;brain&#8208;barrier (BBB) penetration remain significant challenges for siRNA delivery for GBM therapy. Herein, novel cation&#8208;free siRNA micelles, prepared by the self&#8208;assembly of siRNA&#8208;disulfide&#8208;poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (siRNA&#8208;SS&#8208;PNIPAM) diblock copolymers, are prepared. The siRNA micelles not only display enhanced blood circulation time, superior cell take&#8208;up, and effective at&#8208;site siRNA release, but also achieve potent BBB penetration. Moreover, due to being non&#8208;cationic, these siRNA micelles exert no charge&#8208;associated toxicity. Notably, these desirable properties of this novel RNA interfering (RNAi) nanomedicine result in outstanding growth inhibition of orthotopic U87MG xenografts without causing adverse effects, achieving remarkably improved survival benefits. Moreover, as a novel type of polymeric micelle, the siRNA micelle displays effective drug loading ability. When utilizing temozolomide (TMZ) as a model loading drug, the siRNA micelle realizes effective synergistic therapy effect via targeting the key gene (signal transducers and activators of transcription 3, STAT3) in TMZ drug resistant pathways. The authors&#8217; results show that this siRNA micelle nanoparticle can serve as a robust and versatile drug codelivery platform, and RNAi nanomedicine and for effective GBM treatment.

         <title>Boron Nitride Nanosheets Can Induce Water Channels Across Lipid Bilayers Leading to Lysosomal Permeabilization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interactions of hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets with cells are revealed using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations, liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation, and in vitro imaging methods. Lipid bilayer penetration occurs through a cross&#8208;membrane water channel formation, opening the door to a better understanding of the potential cytotoxicity mechanisms of 2D materials and their biomedical applications.








Abstract
While the interaction between 2D materials and cells is of key importance to the development of nanomedicines and safe applications of nanotechnology, still little is known about the biological interactions of many emerging 2D materials. Here, an investigation of how hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) interacts with the cell membrane is carried out by combining molecular dynamics (MD), liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation, and in vitro imaging methods. MD simulations reveal that a sharp hBN wedge can penetrate a lipid bilayer and form a cross&#8208;membrane water channel along its exposed polar edges, while a round hBN sheet does not exhibit this behavior. It is hypothesized that such water channels can facilitate cross&#8208;membrane transport, with important consequences including lysosomal membrane permeabilization, an emerging mechanism of cellular toxicity that involves the release of cathepsin B and generation of radical oxygen species leading to cell apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, two types of hBN nanosheets, one with a rhomboidal, cornered morphology and one with a round morphology, are prepared, and human lung epithelial cells are exposed to both materials. The cornered hBN with lateral polar edges results in a dose&#8208;dependent cytotoxic effect, whereas round hBN does not cause significant toxicity, thus confirming our&#160;premise.

         <title>Freestanding Ferroelectric Bubble Domains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelectric bubble&#8208;like domains, a precursor to electrical skyrmions, arise in epitaxially clamped complex oxide heterostructures. These specially ordered electric dipoles are stable in a freestanding state despite the presence of inhomogeneously distributed structural ripples. This finding opens the door to explore electric skyrmions with arbitrary boundaries and physically flexible topological orders in ferroelectric curvilinear space.








Abstract
Bubble&#8208;like domains, typically a precursor to the electrical skyrmions, arise in ultrathin complex oxide ferroelectric&#8211;dielectric&#8211;ferroelectric heterostructures epitaxially clamped with flat substrates. Here, it is reported that these specially ordered electric dipoles can also be retained in a freestanding state despite the presence of inhomogeneously distributed structural ripples. By probing local piezo and capacitive responses and using atomistic simulations, this study analyzes these ripples, sheds light on how the bubbles are stabilized in the modified electromechanical energy landscape, and discusses the difference in morphology between bubbles in freestanding and as&#8208;grown states. These results are anticipated to be the starting point of a new paradigm for the exploration of electric skyrmions with arbitrary boundaries and physically flexible topological orders in ferroelectric curvilinear space.

         <title>Molten&#8208;Salt&#8208;Assisted CsPbI3 Perovskite Crystallization for Nearly 20%&#8208;Efficiency Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molten&#8208;salt&#8208;assisted crystallization (MSAC) strategy is developed to improve the grain growth of all&#8208;inorganic perovskite films. MSAC enables more active mass transfer and interaction among precursor colloids. Devices based on the MSAC strategy show much increased  efficiency to as high as 19.83% with open&#8208;circuit voltage as high as 1.2 V.








Abstract
Dynamic manipulation of crystallization is pivotal to the quality of polycrystalline films. A molten&#8208;salt&#8208;assisted crystallization (MSAC) strategy is presented to improve grain growth of the all&#8208;inorganic perovskite films. Compared with the traditional solvent annealing, MSAC enables more intensive mass transfer by means of convection and diffusion, which is beneficial to the interaction among the precursor colloids and to inducing in&#8208;plane growth of perovskite grains, resulting in the formation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films with suppressed pinhole and crack formation. Additionally, the introduction of molten salt alters the intermediate phases, and thus changes the crystallization pathways by reducing the energy barrier to produce films with desired optical and electrical properties. As a result, the MSAC strategy endows the devices with champion steady&#8208;state output efficiency of 19.83% and open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) as high as 1.2&#160;V, among the highest for this type of solar cell, thanks to its effectively reduced Voc deficit.

         <title>Visualizing Van der Waals Epitaxial Growth of 2D Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new growth mode of 2D van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures with distinctly different morphologies and growth rates from the conventional mode is observed using a custom&#8208;built system integrating physical vapor deposition with in situ optical microscopy/Raman spectroscopy. A model to explain these two growth modes is proposed, which appears to be applicable to 2D vdW heterostructures in general.








Abstract
Understanding the growth mechanisms of 2D van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures is of great importance in exploring their functionalities and device applications. A custom&#8208;built system integrating physical vapor deposition and optical microscopy/Raman spectroscopy is employed to study the dynamic growth processes of 2D vdW heterostructures in situ. This allows the identification of a new growth mode with a distinctly different growth rate and morphology from those of the conventional linear growth mode. A model that explains the difference in morphologies and quantifies the growth rates of the two modes by taking the role of surface diffusion into account is proposed. A range of material combinations including CdI2/WS2, CdI2/MoS2, CdI2/WSe2, PbI2/WS2, PbI2/MoS2, PbI2/WSe2, and Bi2Se3/WS2 is systematically investigated. These findings may be generalized to the synthesis of many other 2D heterostructures with controlled morphologies and physical properties, benefiting future device applications.

         <title>Construction of Messenger RNA (mRNA) Probes Delivered By Lipid Nanoparticles to Visualize Intracellular Protein Expression and Localization at Organelles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of mRNA probes is designed to image specific organelles. When delivered by lipid nanoparticles, these mRNA probes enable the visualization of intracellular protein trafficking and localization in cells. Moreover, these mRNA probes can also be applied to visualize specific organelles in vivo.








Abstract
Organelles are specialized compartments, where various proteins reside and play crucial roles to maintain essential cellular structures and functions in mammalian cells. A comprehensive understanding of protein expressions and subsequent localizations at each organelle is of great benefit to the development of organelle&#8208;based therapies. Herein, a set of single or dual organelle labeling messenger RNAs (SOLAR or DOLAR) is designed as novel imaging probes, which encode fluorescent proteins with various organelle localization signals. These mRNA probes enable to visualize the protein localizations at different organelles and investigate their trafficking from ribosomal machinery to specific organelles. According to the in vitro results, SOLAR probes show organelle targeting capabilities consistent with the design. Moreover, DOLAR probes with different linkers display distinct targeting properties depending on different organelle localization signals. Additionally, these mRNA probes also exhibit organelle labeling ability in vivo when delivered by lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Therefore, these mRNA&#8208;based probes provide a unique tool to study cell organelles and may facilitate the design of organelle&#8208;based therapies.

         <title>NanoRobotic Structures with Embedded Actuation via Ion Induced Folding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fabrication method for 4D nanorobotic systems via ion&#8208;induced folding is introduced. By tailoring the patterning and folding parameters, dynamic 4D microstructures with personalized properties are achieved using planar multilayer structures obtained by batch fabrication. High nanorobotic performances are demonstrated theoretically and experimentally through a folded gripper.








Abstract
4D structures are tridimensional structures with time&#8208;varying abilities that provide high versatility, sophisticated designs, and a broad spectrum of actuation and sensing possibilities. The downsizing of these structures below 100 &#956;m opens up exceptional opportunities for many disciplines, including photonics, acoustics, medicine, and nanorobotics. However, it requires a paradigm shift in manufacturing methods, especially for dynamic structures. A novel fabrication method based on ion&#8208;induced folding of planar multilayer structures embedding their actuation is proposed&#8212;the planar structures are fabricated in bulk through batch microfabrication techniques. Programmable and accurate bidirectional foldings (&#8722;70&#176;&#160;&#8722;&#160;+90&#176;) of Silica/Chromium/Aluminium (SiO2/Cr/Al) multilayer structures are modeled, experimentally demonstrated then applied to embedded electrothermal actuation of controllable and dynamic 4D nanorobotic structures. The method is used to produce high&#8208;performances case&#8208;study grippers for nanorobotic applications in confined environments. Once folded, a gripping task at the nano&#8208;scale is demonstrated. The proposed fabrication method is suitable for creating small&#8208;scale 4D systems for nanorobotics, medical devices, and tunable metamaterials, where rapid folding and enhanced dynamic control are required.

Antiviral Coatings
During the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, robust and effective antimicrobial and antiviral fabrics have been required. In article 2104298, Michael D. Dickey, Vi Khanh Truong, Tae&#8208;il Kim, and co&#8208;workers propose an easy&#8208;to&#8208;control and straightforward method to coat gallium liquid metal (LM) particles on a wide range of fabrics to facilitate the deposition of liquid metal copper alloy (LMCu) particles. This coating can offer robust adhesion on fabrics and provides huge potential toward rapid eradication of a wide range of bacteria, fungi, and viruses.

Skyrmion Generation/Deletion
The generation/deletion of magnetic skyrmions at a specific area on a device is the most demanding issue in skyrmionics. In article number 2104406, Chanyong Hwang and co&#8208;workers introduce a recipe for magnetic skyrmion generation/deletion. A vertically injected current pulse induces skyrmion generation/deletion one by one depending on the polarity. Using this vertical&#8208;current concept with a spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;torque&#8208;driven skyrmion  shifting, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of skyrmion racetrack memory is presented.

Tumor Therapy
In article number 2104779, Meng Zheng, Bingyang Shi, and co&#8208;workers develop a kind of polymeric siRNA micelle as an effective drug&#8208;delivery platform and potent RNAi nanomedicine for glioblastoma therapy. The siRNA micelles are capable of traversing the blood&#8211;brain barrier via transcytosis mediated by scavenger receptors, to subsequently target a brain tumor and then exert potent RNAi therapy or RNAi&#8208;Chemo synergistic therapy.

Flexible Electronics
In article number 2104446, Takafumi Uemura, Tsuyoshi Sekitani, and co&#8208;workers report the modulation of charge carriers in ultraflexible organic integrated circuits. This is achieved by introducing heterogeneous functional dielectric patterns through ultraviolet&#8208;light irradiation. Consequently, the threshold voltage is precisely controlled from negative to even positive values, and performance metrics of ultraflexible integrated circuits are maximized.

         <title>Application of Triplet&#8211;Triplet Annihilation Upconversion in Organic Optoelectronic Devices: Advances and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive summary of advances toward developing efficient triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA) upconversion materials and their application in optoelectronic devices is systematically given. The key challenges and perspectives of TTA upconversion systems for further improvement for optoelectronic devices and other related research directions are provided. This review hopes to provide valuable guidelines for future advancement in organic optoelectronics.








Abstract
Organic semiconductor materials have been widely used in various optoelectronic devices due to their rich optical and/or electrical properties, which are highly related to their excited states. Therefore, how to manage and utilize the excited states in organic semiconductors is essential for the realization of high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices. Triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA) upconversion is a unique process of converting two non&#8208;emissive triplet excitons to one singlet exciton with higher energy. Efficient optical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical devices can be realized by harvesting sub&#8208;bandgap photons through TTA&#8208;based upconversion. In electrical&#8208;to&#8208;optical devices, triplets generated after the combination of electrons and holes also can be efficiently utilized via TTA, which resulted in a high internal conversion efficiency of 62.5%. Currently, many interesting explorations and significant advances have been demonstrated in these fields. In this review, a comprehensive summary of these intriguing advances on developing efficient TTA upconversion materials and their application in optoelectronic devices is systematically given along with some discussions. Finally, the key challenges and perspectives of TTA upconversion systems for further improvement for optoelectronic devices and other related research directions are provided. This review hopes to provide valuable guidelines for future related research and advancement in organic optoelectronics.

         <title>Updated Insights into 3D Architecture Electrodes for Micropower Sources</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D architecture electrode design enhances  energy storage capability within a limited footprint area. The superiority of 3D architecture electrodes for performance improvement of microbatteries and microsupercapacitors is comprehensively addressed. The most recent research  advances, current challenges, and future perspectives are outlined and discussed.








Abstract
Microbatteries (MBs) and microsupercapacitors (MSCs) are primary on&#8208;chip micropower sources that drive autonomous and stand&#8208;alone microelectronic devices for implementation of the Internet of Things (IoT). However, the performance of conventional MBs and MSCs is restricted by their 2D thin&#8208;film electrode design, and these devices struggle to satisfy the increasing IoT energy demands for high energy density, high power density, and long lifespan. The energy densities of MBs and MSCs can be improved significantly through adoption of a 2D thick&#8208;film electrode design; however, their power densities and lifespans deteriorate with increased electrode thickness. In contrast, 3D architecture electrodes offer remarkable opportunities to simultaneously improve MB and MSC energy density, power density, and lifespan. To date, various 3D architecture electrodes have been designed, fabricated, and investigated for MBs and MSCs. This review provides an update on the principal superiorities of 3D architecture electrodes over 2D thick&#8208;film electrodes in the context of improved MB and MSC energy density, power density, and lifespan. In addition, the most recent and representative progress in 3D architecture electrode development for MBs and MSCs is highlighted. Finally, present challenges are discussed and key perspectives for future research in this field are outlined.

         <title>Bioengineering Approaches for the Advanced Organoid Research</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence of organoid technologies, in terms of development of 3D miniature organs in vitro, has provided revolutionized approaches for understanding developmental processes and disease modeling. Comprehensive insights into the materials and genome engineering techniques applied to organoid culture are demonstrated. Based on the recent achievements, prospects and key challenges for the next&#8208;generation organoid technologies are also discussed.








Abstract
Recent advances in 3D cell culture technology have enabled scientists to generate stem cell derived organoids that recapitulate the structural and functional characteristics of native organs. Current organoid technologies have been striding toward identifying the essential factors for controlling the processes involved in organoid development, including physical cues and biochemical signaling. There is a growing demand for engineering dynamic niches characterized by conditions that resemble in vivo organogenesis to generate reproducible and reliable organoids for various applications. Innovative biomaterial&#8208;based and advanced engineering&#8208;based approaches have been incorporated into conventional organoid culture methods to facilitate the development of organoid research. The recent advances in organoid engineering, including extracellular matrices and genetic modulation, are comprehensively summarized to pinpoint the parameters critical for organ&#8208;specific patterning. Moreover, perspective trends in developing tunable organoids in response to exogenous and endogenous cues are discussed for next&#8208;generation developmental studies, disease modeling, and therapeutics.

         <title>Evolution of Graphene Patterning: From Dimension Regulation to Molecular Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 45, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene patterning has attracted widespread attention owing to its ability to tailor the structures and properties of graphene, targeting high&#8208;tech applications. The established strategies have been evolved from the initial dimension regulation to the emerging molecular engineering of graphene sheets. In general, these methods can be divided into top&#8208;down/bottom&#8208;up and chemical patterning routes as comprehensively discussed in this review.








Abstract
The realization that nanostructured graphene featuring nanoscale width can confine electrons to open its bandgap has aroused scientists&#8217; attention to the regulation of graphene structures, where the concept of graphene patterns emerged. Exploring various effective methods for creating graphene patterns has led to the birth of a new field termed graphene patterning, which has evolved into the most vigorous and intriguing branch of graphene research during the past decade. The efforts in this field have resulted in the development of numerous strategies to structure graphene, affording a variety of graphene patterns with tailored shapes and sizes. The established patterning approaches combined with graphene chemistry yields a novel chemical patterning route via molecular engineering, which opens up a new era in graphene research. In this review, the currently developed graphene patterning strategies is systematically outlined, with emphasis on the chemical patterning. In addition to introducing the basic concepts and the important progress of traditional methods, which are generally categorized into top&#8208;down, bottom&#8208;up technologies, an exhaustive review of established protocols for emerging chemical patterning is presented. At the end, an outlook for future development and challenges is proposed.

         <title>Roll&#8208;to&#8208;Roll Dry Transfer of Large&#8208;scale Graphene</title>

Abstract
A major challenge for graphene applications is the lack of mass production technology for large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;quality graphene growth and transfer. Large&#8208;scale graphene transfer is currently limited to wet chemical etching and electrochemical delamination. These processes result in doped graphene because of chemical residues. Moreover, wet chemical etching does not allow recycling of graphene growth substrates, while generating a large amount of chemical waste. Here, we report a roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll (R2R) dry transfer process for large&#8208;scale graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The process is fast, controllable, and environmentally benign. It avoids chemical contamination and allows the reuse of graphene growth substrates. By controlling tension and speed of the R2R dry transfer process, the electrical sheet resistance is achieved as 9.5 k&#937;/sq, the lowest ever reported among R2R dry transferred graphene samples. The R2R dry transferred samples are used to fabricate graphene&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistors (GFETs) on polymer. We demonstrate that these flexible GFETs feature a near&#8208;zero doping level and a gate leakage current one to two orders of magnitude lower than those fabricated using wet&#8208;chemical etched graphene samples. We further demonstrate the scalability and uniformity of the R2R dry transferred graphene by successfully transferring a 3&#215;3&#160;in2 sample and measuring its field&#8208;effect mobility with 36 millimeter&#8208;scaled GFETs evenly spaced on the sample. The field&#8208;effect mobility of the R2R dry transferred graphene is determined to be 205&#177;36&#160;cm2/V.

         <title>Moisture&#8208;wicking, Breathable and Intrinsically Antibacterial Electronic Skin Based on Dual Gradient poly(ionic liquid) Nanofiber Membranes
</title>

Electronic skin can detect minute electrical potential changes in the human skin and represent the body's state, which is critical for medical diagnostics and human&#8208;computer interface development. On the other hand, sweat has a significant effect on the signal stability, comfort, and safety of electronic skin in a real&#8208;world application. In this study, by modifying the cation and anion of poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) and the spinning process, we were able to create a PIL based multilayer nanofiber membrane (PIL membrane) electronic skin with a dual gradient. PIL electronic skin is moisture&#8208;wicking and breathable due to the hydrophilicity and pore size gradients. The intrinsically antimicrobial activities of PILs allow the safe collection of bioelectrical signals from the human body, such as electrocardiography (ECG) and electromyography (EMG). In addition, the robotic hand may be operated in real&#8208;time, and a preliminary human&#8208;computer interface can be accomplished by simple processing of the collected EMG signal. This study establishes a novel practical approach for monitoring and using bioelectrical signals in real&#8208;world circumstances via the multifunctional electronic skin.

         <title>Decoupling Complex Multi&#8208;Length&#8208;Scale Morphology in Non&#8208;Fullerene Photovoltaics with Nitrogen K&#8208;Edge Resonant Soft X&#8208;Ray Scattering</title>

Abstract
Complex morphology in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and other functional soft materials commonly dictates performance. Such complexity in OPVs originates from the kinetically trapped nonequilibrium state on mesoscale, which governs device charge generation and transport. Resonant soft x&#8208;ray scattering (RSoXS) has been revolutionary on the exploration of OPV morphology in the past decade due to its chemical and orientation sensitivity. However, for non&#8208;fullerene OPVs, RSoXS analysis near the carbon K&#8208;edge has been challenging, due to the chemical similarity of materials used in active layers. An innovative approach is provided by nitrogen K&#8208;edge RSoXS (NK&#8208;RSoXS), utilizing the spatial and orientational contrasts from the cyano groups in the acceptor materials, which allows for determination of phase separation. Of particular importance is that the NK&#8208;RSoXS, for the first time, clearly visualizes the combined feature sizes in PM6:Y6 blends from crystallization and liquid&#8208;liquid demixing, determining optoelectronic properties. NK&#8208;RSoXS also reveals that PM6:Y6:Y6&#8208;BO ternary blends with reduced phase separation size and enhanced material crystallization can lead to current amplification in devices. Nitrogen is common in organic semiconductors and other soft materials, and the strong and directional N 1&#8594;&#960;* resonances make NK&#8208;RSoXS a powerful tool to uncover the mesoscale complexity and open opportunities to understand heterogeneous systems.

         <title>Tailoring Interlayer Spacers for Efficient and Stable Formamidinium&#8208;Based Low&#8208;Dimensional Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The two&#8208;dimensional Dion&#8208;Jacobson (DJ) perovskite solar cells generally show mediocre device performances as restrained by their defective film quality. The rigid diammonium organic interlayer spacers are intolerant to lattice mismatches, which induces defects and distortions and ultimately deteriorates the optoelectronic properties. Herein, we introduce a secondary interlayer spacer into the formamidinium (FA) based low&#8208;dimensional perovskite and substantially improve the film quality. The flexible monovalent spacer cations effectively alleviate lattice distortions and reduce crystal defects, providing perovskite films with desirable microscopic morphology, preferable crystal orientation, reduced defect states and improved charge transport capability. As a result, the optimized perovskite solar cell (PSC) based on the (PDA0.9PA0.2)(FA)3Pb4I13 (PDA = propane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diammonium, PA = propylammonium) film exhibits the exceptional power conversion efficiency of 16.0%, the highest reported value in its class. In addition, the device demonstrates the enhanced thermal stability, retaining 90% of its initial efficiency after aging at 85&#176;C for 800 h.

         <title>Extreme Environmental Thermal Shock Induced Dislocation&#8208;Rich Pt Nanoparticles Boosting Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An environmental high&#8208;temperature thermal&#8208;shock method is proposed to generate dislocation&#8208;rich Pt nanoparticles in a liquid&#8208;nitrogen cooling medium. Structural stress and thermal stress trigger the formation of dislocations. The fast&#8208;cooling rate makes dislocations kinetically frozen in nanoparticles. The strain induced by dislocations downshifts the d&#8208;band center of the Pt, leading to weakened adsorption energy between the metal and reaction intermediates.








Abstract
Crystal structure engineering of nanomaterials is crucial for the design of electrocatalysts. Inducing dislocations is an efficient approach to generate strain effects in nanomaterials to optimize the crystal and electronic structures and improve the catalytic properties. However, it is almost impossible to produce and retain dislocations in commercial mainstream catalysts, such as single metal platinum (Pt) catalysts. In this work, a non&#8208;equilibrium high&#8208;temperature (&gt;1400 K) thermal&#8208;shock method is reported to induce rich dislocations in Pt nanocrystals (Dr&#8208;Pt). The method is performed in an extreme environment (&#8776;77 K) created by liquid nitrogen. The dislocations induced within milliseconds by thermal and structural stress during the crystallization process are kinetically frozen at an ultrafast cooling rate. The high&#8208;energy surface structures with dislocation&#8208;induced strain effects can prevent surface restructuring during catalysis. The findings indicate that a novel extreme environmental high&#8208;temperature thermal&#8208;shock method can successfully introduce rich dislocations in Pt nanoparticles and significantly boost its hydrogen evolution reaction performance.

         <title>Modeling the Triboelectric Behaviors of Elastomeric Nonwoven Fabrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An analytical model is developed for nonwoven&#8208;based triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) working at conductor&#8208;to&#8208;dielectric contact mode. The model fits well with different sets of experimental data at reasonable mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and suggests that nonwoven triboelectric output reaches a maximum at a specific thickness, solidity, or average fiber diameter when other structural parameters are fixed.








Abstract
Theoretical modeling of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) is fundamental to their performance optimization, since it can provide useful guidance on the material selection, structure design, and parameter control of relevant systems. Built on the theoretical model of film&#8208;based TENGs, here, an analytical model is introduced for conductor&#8208;to&#8208;dielectric contact&#8208;mode nonwoven&#8208;based TENGs, which copes with the unique hierarchical structure of nonwovens and details the correlation between the triboelectric output (maximum transferred charge density) and nonwoven structural parameters (thickness, solidity, and average fiber diameter). A series of styrene&#8211;ethylene&#8211;butylene&#8211;styrene nonwoven samples are fabricated through a melt&#8208;blowing process to map nonwoven structural features within certain ranges, while an ion&#8208;injection protocol is adopted to quantify the triboelectric output with superior consistency and reproducibility. With a database containing structural features and triboelectric output of 43 nonwoven samples, a good model fitting is achieved via nonlinear regression analysis in Python, which also shows good predictive power and suggests the existing of tribo&#8208;output maxima at a specific thickness, solidity, or average fiber diameter when other structural parameters are fixed. The model is also successfully applied to a group of polypropylene meltblown nonwovens, which verifies its universality on meltblown&#8208;nonwoven&#8208;based TENGs.

&lt;p&gt;An analytical model is developed for nonwoven-based triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) working at conductor-to-dielectric contact mode. The model fits well with different sets of experimental data at reasonable mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and suggests that nonwoven triboelectric output reaches a maximum at a specific thickness, solidity, or average fiber diameter when other structural parameters are fixed.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Ionic Crosslinking Induced Nanochannels: Nanophase Separation for Ion Transport Promotion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Charge&#8208;governed ion transport is crucial to numerous industries, and the advanced membrane is the essential component. In nature, the efficient and selective ion transport is mainly governed by the charged ion channels located in cell membrane, indicating the architecture with functional differentiation. Inspired by this architecture, we design and fabricate a membrane by ionic crosslinking sulfonated poly(arylene ether ketone) (SPAEK) and imidazolium&#8208;functionalized poly(arylene ether sulfone) (IPAES) to make full use of the charges. This ionic crosslinking is designed to realize nanophase separation to aggregate the ion pathways in the membrane, which results in excellent ion selectivity and high ion conductivity. With the excellent ion transport behavior, ionic crosslinking membrane shows great potential in osmotic energy conversion, which maximum power density can be up to 16.72 W/m2. This design of ionic crosslinking&#8208;induced nanophase separation offers a roadmap for ion transport promotion.

         <title>Direct&#8208;bandgap bilayer WSe2/microsphere monolithic cavity for low&#8208;threshold lasing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as widely accepted two&#8208;dimensional (2D) gain materials in the field of light sources owing to their direct bandgap and high photoluminescence quantum yield. However, the monolayer medium suffers from weak emission because only a single layer of molecules can absorb the pump energy. Moreover, the material degradation when transferring these fragile materials hinders their cooperation with the optical cavity further. In this study, for the first time, we develop a high&#8208;quality monolithic structure by directly growing single&#8208;domain tungsten diselenide (WSe2) bilayers on single silica microsphere (MS) cavities. Such a completely wrapped structure guides the indirect&#8208;to&#8208;direct bandgap transition of WSe2 bilayers, leading to a significantly improved photoluminescence intensity by about 60 folds. Moreover, the high&#8208;quality monolithic structure enhances the confinement factor of the cavity by more than 20 folds. Based on the above advantages, we realize a bilayer WSe2/MS microlaser with an ultralow threshold of 0.72 W&#160;cm&#8722;2, nearly an order of magnitude lower than the existing records. The results demonstrate the possibility of using multilayer TMD materials as 2D gain media and provide insights into a new ultra&#8208;compact monolithic platform of TMD material/cavity for lasing devices.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;high Sensitive Au&#8208;doped Silicon Nanomembrane Based Wearable Sensor Arrays for Continuous Skin Temperature Monitoring with High Precision</title>

Abstract
Monitoring the body temperature with high accuracy provides a fast, facile, but powerful route about the human body in a wide range of health information standards. Here, we introduce the first ever ultra&#8208;sensitive, and stretchable gold&#8208;doped silicon nanomembrane (Au&#8208;doped SiNM) epidermal temperature sensor array. The ultra&#8208;sensitivity is achieved by shifting freeze&#8208;out region to intrinsic region in carrier density and modulation of fermi energy level of p&#8208;type SiNM through the development of a novel gold&#8208;doping strategy. The Au&#8208;doped SiNM is readily transferred onto an ultrathin polymer layer with a well&#8208;designed serpentine mesh structure, capable of being utilized as an epidermal temperature sensor array. Measurements in&#8208;vivo and in&#8208;vitro show temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) as high as &#8208;37270.72ppm/&#176;C,&#160;22&#160;times higher than existing metal&#8208;based temperature sensors with similar structures, and one of the highest thermal sensitivity among the inorganic material based temperature sensors. Applications in the continuous monitoring of body temperature and respiration rate during exercising (i.e., in a sweat environment) are demonstrated with a successful capture of information. This work lays a foundation for monitoring human body temperature, potentially useful for precision diagnosis (e.g., continuous monitoring body temperature in COVID&#8208;19 cases) and management of disease relevance to body and skin temperature in healthcare.

         <title>Thermally Controlled Charge&#8208;Carrier Transitions in Disordered PbSbTe Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Binary and ternary chalcogenides have recently attracted much attention due to their wide range of applications including phase&#8208;change memory materials,[2] topological insulators,[4] photonic switches,[7] and thermoelectrics.[12] These applications require a precise control of the number and mobility of charge carriers. Here, we report on an unexpected charge&#8208;carrier transition in ternary compounds from the PbTe&#8211;Sb2Te3 pseudo&#8208;binary line. Upon thermal annealing, sputtered thin films of PbSb2Te4 and Pb2Sb2Te5 undergo a transition in the temperature coefficient of resistance and in the type of the majority charge carriers from n&#8208;type to p&#8208;type. These transitions are observed upon increasing structural order within one crystallographic phase. To account for this striking observation, we propose that the Fermi energy shifts from the tail of the conduction band to the valence band because different levels of overall structural disorder lead to different predominant types of native point defects. This view is confirmed by an extensive computational study, revealing a transition from excess cations and SbPb for high levels of disorder to PbSb prevailing for low disorder. Our findings will help fine&#8208;tune transport properties in certain chalcogenides via proper thermal treatment, with potential benefits for memories, thermoelectric material optimization, and neuromorphic devices.

         <title>An Ultrarobust and High&#8208;Performance Rotational Hydrodynamic Triboelectric Nanogenerator Enabled by Automatic Mode Switching and Charge Excitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charge excitation and automatic mode switching triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is proposed, which displays outstanding durability and electrical output at the same time. This work provides an ideal scheme for enhancing the mechanical durability and broadening the range of working frequency as well as improving the electrical output performance of TENGs.








Abstract
The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is an emerging technology for ambient mechanical energy harvesting, which provides a possibility to realize wild environment monitoring by self&#8208;powered sensing systems. However, TENGs are limited in some practical applications as a result of their low output performance (low charge density) and mechanical durability (material abrasion). Herein, an ultrarobust and high&#8208;performance rotational TENG enabled by automatic mode switching (contact mode at low speed and noncontact at high speed) and charge excitation is proposed. It displays excellent stability, maintaining 94% electrical output after 72&#160;000 cycles, much higher than that of the normal contact&#8208;mode TENG (30%). Due to its high electrical stability and large electrical output, this TENG powers 944 green light&#8208;emitting diodes to brightness in series. Furthermore, by harvesting water&#8208;flow energy, various commercial capacitors can be charged quickly, and a self&#8208;powered fire alarm and self&#8208;powered temperature and humidity detection are realized. This work provides an ideal scheme for enhancing the mechanical durability, broadening the range of working frequency, and improving the electrical output of TENGs.

&lt;p&gt;A charge excitation and automatic mode switching triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is proposed, which displays outstanding durability and electrical output at the same time. This work provides an ideal scheme for enhancing the mechanical durability and broadening the range of working frequency as well as improving the electrical output performance of TENGs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is an emerging technology for ambient mechanical energy harvesting, which provides a possibility to realize wild environment monitoring by self-powered sensing systems. However, TENGs are limited in some practical applications as a result of their low output performance (low charge density) and mechanical durability (material abrasion). Herein, an ultrarobust and high-performance rotational TENG enabled by automatic mode switching (contact mode at low speed and noncontact at high speed) and charge excitation is proposed. It displays excellent stability, maintaining 94% electrical output after 72&#160;000 cycles, much higher than that of the normal contact-mode TENG (30%). Due to its high electrical stability and large electrical output, this TENG powers 944 green light-emitting diodes to brightness in series. Furthermore, by harvesting water-flow energy, various commercial capacitors can be charged quickly, and a self-powered fire alarm and self-powered temperature and humidity detection are realized. This work provides an ideal scheme for enhancing the mechanical durability, broadening the range of working frequency, and improving the electrical output of TENGs. In addition, the high-performance hydrodynamic TENG demonstrated in this work will have great applications for Internet of Things in remote areas.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Doping&#8208;Induced Dielectric Catastrophe Prompts Free&#8208;Carrier Release in Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general mechanism for the doping&#8208;induced insulator&#8211;conductor transition in organic semiconductors is proposed. Multiscale simulations unveil the high polarizability of dopant&#8211;semiconductor complexes and predict large nonlinear enhancements of the dielectric constant as the system approaches a dielectric instability (catastrophe) upon increasing doping. Such an enhanced screening frees charges from Coulomb barriers at concentrations of 5&#8211;10%, in accordance with experiments.








Abstract
The control over material properties attainable through molecular doping is essential to many technological applications of organic semiconductors, such as organic light&#8208;emitting diodes or thermoelectrics. These excitonic semiconductors typically reach the degenerate limit only at impurity concentrations of 5&#8211;10%, a phenomenon that has been put in relation with the strong Coulomb binding between charge carriers and ionized dopants, and whose comprehension remained elusive so far. This study proposes a general mechanism for the release of carriers at finite doping in terms of collective screening phenomena. A multiscale model for the dielectric properties of doped organic semiconductor is set up by combining first principles and microelectrostatic calculations. The results predict a large nonlinear enhancement of the dielectric constant (tenfold at 8% load) as the system approaches a dielectric instability (catastrophe) upon increasing doping. This can be attributed to the presence of highly polarizable host&#8211;dopant complexes, plus a nontrivial leading contribution from dipolar interactions in the disordered and heterogeneous system. The enhanced screening in the material drastically reduces the (free) energy barriers for electron&#8211;hole separation, rationalizing the possibility for thermal charge release. The proposed mechanism is consistent with conductivity data and sets the basis for achieving higher conductivities at lower doping loads.

         <title>Challenges and Strategies towards Practically Feasible Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Remarkable improvement of inorganic solid electrolytes has opened up the opportunities to realize commercialization of solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs). However, practical operation of SSLMBs faces challenges of poor stability and low energy efficiency. This review introduces current understandings regarding the underlying origins of the issues in SSLMBs and discussions on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies to overcome these challenges.








Abstract
Remarkable improvement of the ionic conductivity of inorganic solid electrolytes (SEs) exceeding 10 mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature has opened up the opportunities to realize the commercialization of solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs). The transition to the intrinsically inflammable SEs also promises that SSBs would successfully utilize lithium metal anode thus achieving the high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries without the risk of a safety hazard. However, the practical operation of solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) still faces the challenges of the poor cycle stability and the low energy efficiency, which are coupled with the interface stability and even with the dendrite growth of lithium metal. This article overviews current understandings regarding the underlying origins of the issues in employing the lithium metal anode in SSLMBs from the five main standpoints: i) the chemical/electrochemical interfacial stability, ii) the microscopic evolution of interfacial morphology, iii) the intrinsic diffusivity of lithium atom/vacancy at the interface, iv) imperfections (defect/pores), and v) non&#8208;negligible electronic conductivity of SEs. The discussions are followed on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efforts and strategies to overcome these respective challenges. Finally, the authors provide their perspectives for the future research directions toward achieving the commercial level of high&#8208;energy SSLMBs.

         <title>Design of Quasi&#8208;MOF Nanospheres as a Dynamic Electrocatalyst toward Accelerated Sulfur Reduction Reaction for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quasi&#8208;metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework (quasi&#8208;MOF) nanospheres are developed as a sulfur electrocatalyst, wherein abundant metal nodes that act as active sites are exposed, rendering strong lithium polysulfides absorbability. The dynamic structure evolution over the sulfur reduction reaction can effectively promote catalytic conversion of lithium polysulfides, leading to accelerated reaction kinetics. This quasi&#8208;MOF sulfur composite demonstrates a decent electrochemical performance with prolonged cycle lifespan.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are considered as one of the most promising next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries owing to their high energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the sluggish kinetics of the sulfur reduction reaction process, which is so far insufficiently explored, still impedes its practical application.&#160;Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are widely investigated as&#160;a sulfur immobilizer, but the interactions and catalytic activity of lithium polysulfides (LiPs) on metal nodes are weak due to the presence of organic ligands. Herein, a strategy to design quasi&#8208;MOF nanospheres, which contain a transition&#8208;state structure between the MOF and the metal oxide via controlled ligand exchange strategy, to serve as sulfur electrocatalyst, is presented. The quasi&#8208;MOF not only inherits the porous structure of the MOF, but also exposes abundant metal nodes to act as active sites, rendering strong LiPs absorbability. The reversible deligandation/ligandation of the quasi&#8208;MOF and its impact on the durability of the catalyst over the course of the electrochemical process is acknowledged, which confers a remarkable catalytic activity. Attributed to these structural advantages, the quasi&#8208;MOF delivers a decent discharge capacity and low capacity&#8208;fading rate over long&#8208;term cycling. This work not only offers insight into the rational design of quasi&#8208;MOF&#8208;based composites but also provides guidance for application in Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Probing Electronic States in Monolayer Semiconductors through Static and Transient Third&#8208;Harmonic Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electronic states and their dynamics are of critical importance for electronic and optoelectronic applications. Here, we probe various relevant electronic states in monolayer MoS2, such as multiple excitonic Rydberg states and free&#8208;particle energy bands, with a high relative contrast of up to 200 via broadband (from &#8764;1.79 to 3.10&#160;eV) static third&#8208;harmonic spectroscopy, which is further supported by theoretical calculations. Moreover, we introduce transient third&#8208;harmonic spectroscopy to demonstrate that third&#8208;harmonic generation can be all&#8208;optically modulated with a modulation depth exceeding &#8764;94% at &#8764;2.18&#160;eV, providing direct evidence of dominant carrier relaxation processes, associated with carrier&#8208;exciton and carrier&#8208;phonon interactions. Our results indicate that static and transient third&#8208;harmonic spectroscopies are not only promising techniques for the characterization of monolayer semiconductors and their heterostructures, but also a potential platform for disruptive photonic and optoelectronic applications, including all&#8208;optical modulation and imaging.

         <title>Nanostructure Control in 3D Printed Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Currently, there are no straightforward methods to 3D print materials with nanoscale control over morphological and functional properties. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach for the fabrication of materials with controlled nanoscale morphologies using a rapid and commercially available digital light&#8208;processing 3D printing technique. Our process exploits reversible deactivation radical polymerization to control the in&#8208;situ polymerization&#8208;induced microphase separation of 3D printing resins, which provides materials with complex architectures controllable from the macro&#8208; to nanoscale, resulting in the preparation of materials with enhanced mechanical properties. This method does not require specialized equipment or process conditions and thus represents an important development in the production of advanced materials via additive manufacturing.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are no straightforward methods to 3D print materials with nanoscale control over morphological and functional properties. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach for the fabrication of materials with controlled nanoscale morphologies using a rapid and commercially available digital light-processing 3D printing technique. Our process exploits reversible deactivation radical polymerization to control the in-situ polymerization-induced microphase separation of 3D printing resins, which provides materials with complex architectures controllable from the macro- to nanoscale, resulting in the preparation of materials with enhanced mechanical properties. This method does not require specialized equipment or process conditions and thus represents an important development in the production of advanced materials via additive manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Biomimetic Trachea Engineering via a Modular Ring Strategy Based on Bone&#8208;Marrow Stem Cells and Atelocollagen for use in Extensive Tracheal Reconstruction</title>

Abstract
The fabrication of biomimetic tracheas with cartilaginous rings alternately interspersed between vascularized fibrous tissue (CRVFT) architecture has the potential to perfectly recapitulate normal tracheal structure and function. Herein, we describe the development of a customized chondroitin sulfate&#8208;incorporated type II atelocollagen (COL II/CS) scaffold with excellent chondrogenic capacity and a type I atelocollagen (COL I) scaffold to facilitate the formation of vascularized fibrous tissue. An efficient modular ring strategy was then adopted to develop a CRVFT&#8208;based biomimetic trachea. The in vitro engineering of cartilaginous rings was achieved via the recellularization of ring&#8208;shaped COL II/CS scaffolds using bone marrow stem cells as a mimetic for native cartilaginous ring tissue. A CRVFT&#8208;based trachea with biomimetic mechanical properties composed of bionic biochemical components was additionally successfully generated in vivo via the alternating stacking of cartilaginous rings and ring&#8208;shaped COL I scaffolds on a silicone pipe. The resultant biomimetic trachea with pedicled muscular flaps was used for extensive tracheal reconstruction and exhibited satisfactory therapeutic outcomes with structural and functional properties similar to those of native trachea. This is the first study to utilize stem cells for long&#8208;segmental tracheal cartilaginous regeneration and this represents a promising method for extensive tracheal reconstruction.

         <title>Hierarchically Porous Silica Membrane as Separator for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Commercial polymeric separators in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) typically suffer from limited porosity, low electrolyte wettability, and poor thermal and mechanical stability, which can degrade the battery performance especially at high current densities. Here, we report the design of hierarchically porous, ultralight silica membranes as separator for high&#8208;performance LIBs through the assembly of hollow mesoporous silica (HMS) particles on the cathode surface. The rich mesopores and large cavity of individual HMS particles provide low&#8208;tortuosity pathways for ionic transport, while simultaneously serving as electrolyte reservoir to further boost the electrochemical kinetics. Moreover, benefiting from their inorganic and hierarchically porous nature, such HMS separators display better electrolyte affinity, thermal stability, and mechanical strength than commercial polypropylene (PP) separators. As a demonstration, LIBs with a LiFePO4 cathode coated with HMS separators exhibit exceptional rate capability and cycling stability, outperforming LIBs with PP and Al2O3&#8208;modified PP separators as well as separators made of solid silica particles.

         <title>Homologous Bromides Treatment for Improving the Open&#8208;circuit Voltage of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed organic&#8208;inorganic mixed halide perovskite solar cells have achieved rapid improvements in power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, it is imperative to minimise voltage deficit (Woc = Eg/q&#8208;Voc) for the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art cells for their PCE to approach the theoretical limit. Herein, we report the strategy of depositing homologous bromide salts on the perovskite surface to achieve a surface and bulk passivation for the fabrication of solar cells with high open&#8208;circuit voltage. A Woc of 0.39&#160;V (Voc = 1.24&#160;V) in 1.63&#160;eV bandgap (determined by EQE) perovskite device (PCE = 22.1%) and a Woc of 0.38&#160;V (Voc = 1.18&#160;V) in 1.56&#160;eV bandgap perovskite device (PCE = 23.7%) are demonstrated on 0.159 cm2. Meanwhile, we also achieved an efficiency of 21.8% for a large area device of 1 &#215; 1 cm2. Distinct to the conclusions given by previous works that the homologous bromides such as FABr only react with PbI2 to form a large bandgap perovskite layer on top of the original perovskite, our work finds that the bromide also penetrates the perovskite film and passivates the perovskite in the bulk. This is confirmed by the small bandgap enlargement observed by absorbance and photoluminescence (PL), bromide element ratio increasing in bulk by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry&#160;(TOF&#8208;SIMS) and depth&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Furthermore, a clear suppression of non&#8208;radiative recombination in the perovskite device was confirmed by a variety of characterisations. The best non&#8208;encapsulated device with homologous bromide passivation maintained 97% of its initial efficiency after 2500 hours of ambient storage and 59% after 520 hours of thermal stability test at 85&#176;C. Our work provides a simple and universal way to reduce the Woc of single&#8208;junction perovskite solar cells and it would also shed light on developing other high performance optoelectronic devices, including perovskite&#8208;based tandems and light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs).

         <title>Multifunctional Hyphae Carbon Powering Lithium Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Biotechnology can bring new breakthrough on design and fabrication of energy materials and devices. In this work, for the first time, we propose a novel and facile biological self&#8208;assembly technology to fabricate multifunctional Rhizopus hyphae carbon fibre (RHCF) and its derivatives in large scale for electrochemical energy storage. Crosslinked hollow carbon fibres are successfully prepared by conversion of Rhizopus hyphae, and we further realize macroscopic production of centimeter&#8208;level carbon balls consisting of hollow RHCFs. Moreover, the self&#8208;assembled RHCF balls show strong adsorption characteristics on metal ions and can be converted into a series of derivatives such as RHCF/metal oxides. Notably, the designed RHCF derivatives are demonstrated with powerful multifunctionability as cathode, anode and separator for lithium sulfur batteries (LSBs). The RHCF can act as the host material to combine with metal oxide (CoO) and S, Li metal and polypropylene (PP) separator to form new RHCF/CoO&#8208;S cathode, RHCF/Li anode and RHCF/PP separator, respectively. Consequently, the optimized LSBs full cell presents excellent cycling performance and superior high&#8208;rate capacity (881.3&#160;mA h g&#8211;1 at 1 C). Our work provides a new method for large&#8208;scale preparation of hollow carbon fibres and derivatives for advanced energy storage and conversion.

         <title>The Road for Two&#8208;Dimensional Semiconductors in Silicon Age</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Continued reduction in transistor size can improve the performance of silicon integrated circuits (ICs). However, as Moore's Law approaches physical limits, high&#8208;performance growth in silicon ICs becomes unsustainable, due to challenges of scaling, energy efficiency, and memory limitations. The ultra&#8208;thin layers, diverse band structures, unique electronic properties, and silicon compatible processes of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials create the potential to consistently drive advanced performance in ICs. This review presents the potential of fusing 2D materials with silicon ICs to minimize the challenges in silicon ICs, and to create technologies beyond the von Neumann architecture. It discusses the killer applications for 2D materials in logic and memory devices to ease scaling, energy efficiency bottlenecks, and memory dilemmas encountered in silicon ICs. The fusion of 2D materials allows the creation of all&#8208;in&#8208;one perception, memory and computation technologies beyond the von Neumann architecture to enhance system efficiency and remove computing power bottlenecks. Progress on the 2D ICs demonstration is summarized, as well as the technical hurdles it faces in terms of wafer&#8208;scale heterostructure growth, transfer, and compatible integration with silicon ICs. Finally, the promising pathways and obstacles to the technological advances in ICs due to the integration of 2D materials with silicon is presented.

This review presents the potential of fusing 2D materials with silicon ICs to minimize the challenges in silicon ICs, and to create technologies beyond the von Neumann architecture. It discusses the killer applications for 2D materials in logic and memory devices to ease scaling, energy efficiency bottlenecks, and memory dilemmas encountered in silicon ICs. The fusion of 2D materials allows the creation of all-in-one perception, memory and computation technologies beyond the von Neumann architecture to enhance system efficiency and remove computing power bottlenecks. Progress on the 2D ICs demonstration is summarized, as well as the technical hurdles it faces in terms of wafer-scale heterostructure growth, transfer, and compatible integration with silicon ICs. Finally, the promising pathways and obstacles to the technological advances in ICs due to the integration of 2D materials with silicon is presented.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Manipulating electroluminochromism behavior of viologen substituted iridium(III) complexes through ligand engineering for information display and encryption</title>

Abstract
Electrically controlling photoluminescence has attracted great research interest and offers many opportunities for technological developments. Electroluminochromic materials undergo redox reactions under low&#8208;voltage stimuli to achieve reversible luminescence switching. Till now, photoluminescence switching of a single molecule caused by electrical stimuli is restricted to intensity response because the redox&#8208;active moieties are good electron donor or acceptor and electrical stimuli can regulate the photoinduced electron&#8208;transfer and affect the luminescence intensity. In this work, we report the manipulation of electroluminochromism behavior of a series of viologen substituted iridium(III) complexes through the regulation of ligand orbital energy levels and electronic communication between the viologen pendants and the iridium(III) complex core. Electrochemical redox reactions reversibly modulate either the luminescence quenching effect or the push&#8211;pull electronic effect of the viologen substituents, achieving multicolor &#8220;on&#8208;off&#8221; luminescence response toward electrical stimuli and luminescence manipulation between two emissive states with different wavelengths and lifetimes. To illustrate the promising applications of these electroluminochromic materials recording and displaying luminescence information under electrical stimuli are demonstrated. Information encryption is realized by letting the electroluminochromism occur in the near&#8208;infrared region or in the time domain. Near&#8208;infrared camera or time&#8208;resolved luminescence analysis can be used to help read the invisible information.

         <title>Processing of Self&#8208;Healing Polymers for Soft Robotics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft robots are inherently safe, but prone to various damage types. Self&#8208;healing polymers address this vulnerability. In this work, the variety of processing techniques of self&#8208;healing polymers for robotics in the literature is reviewed and limitations and opportunities are discussed. Two promising research fields are bridged, and a guide is given toward selecting suitable processing methods based on a self&#8208;healing polymer and the intended soft robotics application.








Abstract
Soft robots are, due to their softness, inherently safe and adapt well to unstructured environments. However, they are prone to various damage types. Self&#8208;healing polymers address this vulnerability. Self&#8208;healing soft robots can recover completely from macroscopic damage, extending their lifetime. For developing healable soft robots, various formative and additive manufacturing methods have been exploited to shape self&#8208;healing polymers into complex structures. Additionally, several novel manufacturing techniques, noted as (re)assembly binding techniques that are specific to self&#8208;healing polymers, have been created. Herein, the wide variety of processing techniques of self&#8208;healing polymers for robotics available in the literature is reviewed, and limitations and opportunities discussed thoroughly. Based on defined requirements for soft robots, these techniques are critically compared and validated. A strong focus is drawn to the reversible covalent and (physico)chemical cross&#8208;links present in the self&#8208;healing polymers that do not only endow healability to the resulting soft robotic components, but are also beneficial in many manufacturing techniques. They solve current obstacles in soft robots, including the formation of robust multi&#8208;material parts, recyclability, and stress relaxation. This review bridges two promising research fields, and guides the reader toward selecting a suitable processing method based on a self&#8208;healing polymer and the intended soft robotics&#160;application.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Changing Particles: From Materials Design and Mechanisms to Implementation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The extension of shape&#8208;morphing capabilities to the micro&#8208; and nanoscale has recently enabled novel applications in photonics, microrobotics, biomedicine, and microfluidics. The materials, mechanisms, and fabrication technologies used to create shape&#8208;changing micro&#8208; and nanoparticles are discussed, and key demonstrations in various application areas are summarized comprehensive review.








Abstract
Demands for next&#8208;generation soft and responsive materials have sparked recent interest in the development of shape&#8208;changing particles and particle assemblies. Over the last two decades, a variety of mechanisms that drive shape change have been explored and integrated into particulate systems. Through a combination of top&#8208;down fabrication and bottom&#8208;up synthesis techniques, shape&#8208;morphing capabilities extend from the microscale to the nanoscale. Consequently, shape&#8208;morphing particles are rapidly emerging in a variety of contexts, including photonics, microfluidics, microrobotics, and biomedicine. Herein, the key mechanisms and materials that facilitate shape changes of microscale and nanoscale particles are discussed. Recent progress in the applications made possible by these particles is summarized, and perspectives on their promise and key open challenges in the field are discussed.

         <title>Highly Efficient Self&#8208;Healing Multifunctional Dressing with Antibacterial Activity for Sutureless Wound Closure and Infected Wound Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Wound dressings with wound closure and status monitoring capabilities that can promote wound healing in clinical care have been rarely reported. To achieve more efficient wound management, a novel self&#8208;healing elastomer&#8208;based multifunctional wound dressing has been developed for sutureless wound closure and timely wound infection monitoring. The self&#8208;healing elastomer containing cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) has high mechanical toughness (35&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), biocompatibility and outstanding antibacterial activity (bactericidal rate is &#8764;90% in 12 h), enabling the wound dressing to effectively inhibit bacterial growth and accelerate infected wound healing. The in vivo full&#8208;thickness skin incision model shows that the multifunctional wound dressing can help in contracting wound edges through the excellent self&#8208;healing ability of the elastomer to facilitate wound closure and healing, as evidenced by notably dense and well&#8208;organized collagen deposition. Furthermore, the temperature, pH and glucose level of the wound area can be detected simultaneously by an integrated sensor array in the wound dressing, providing reliable and timely information of the condition of the wound. This proposed self&#8208;healing elastomer&#8208;based multifunctional wound dressing is a promising prospect in clinical wound management and post&#8208;treatment.

         <title>Resonance&#8208;mediated dynamic modulation of perovskite crystallization for efficient and stable solar cells</title>

Abstract
Manipulating perovskite crystallization to prepare high&#8208;quality perovskite films is the key to achieve highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we report a dynamic strategy to modulate perovskite crystallization using a resonance hole&#8208;transporting material (HTM) capable of fast self&#8208;adaptive tautomerization between multiple electronic states with neutral and charged resonance forms for mediating perovskite crystal growth and defects passivation in situ. This approach, based on resonance variation with self&#8208;adaptive molecular interactions between HTM and perovskite, produces high&#8208;quality perovskite films with smooth surface, oriented crystallization and low charge recombination, leading to high&#8208;performance inverted PSCs with power conversion efficiencies approaching to 22% for small&#8208;area devices (0.09&#8201;cm2) and up to 19.5% for large&#8208;area devices (1.02 cm2). Also, remarkably high stability of the PSCs was observed, retaining over 90%, 88%, or 83% of the initial efficiencies in air with relative humidity of 40&#8764;50%, under continuous one&#8208;sun illumination, or at 75&#176;C&#160;annealing for 1000 h without encapsulation.

         <title>Graphitic Aza&#8208;fused &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Networks: Construction, Engineering, and Task&#8208;Specific Applications</title>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) &#960;&#8208;conjugated networks linked by aza&#8208;fused units represent a pivotal category of graphitic materials with stacked nanosheet architectures. Extensive efforts have been directed at their fabrication and application since the discovery of covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs). Besides the triazine cores, tricycloquinazoline (TCQ) and hexaazatriphenylene (HAT) linkages are further introduced to tailor the structures and properties. Diverse related materials have been developed rapidly, and a thorough outlook is necessitated to unveil the structure&#8211;property&#8211;application relationships across multiple subcategories, which is pivotal to guide the design and fabrication towards enhanced task&#8208;specific performance. Herein, we first introduce the structure types and development of related materials including CTFs, covalent quinazoline networks (CQNs), and hexaazatriphenylene networks (HATNs). Advanced synthetic strategies coupled with characterization techniques provide powerful tools to engineer the properties and tune the associated behaviors in corresponding applications. Case studies in the areas of gas adsorption, membrane&#8208;based separation, thermo&#8208;/electro&#8208;/photocatalysis, and energy storage are then addressed, focusing on the correlation between structure/property engineering and optimization of the corresponding performance, particularly the preferred features and strategies in each specific field. In the last section, the underlying challenges and opportunities in construction and application of this emerging and promising material category are discussed.

         <title>Multifunctional Biomedical Materials Derived from Biological Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The delicate structure and fantastic functions of biological membranes are the successful evolutionary results of a long&#8208;term natural selection process. Their excellent biocompatibility and biofunctionality are widely utilized to construct multifunctional biomedical materials mainly by directly camouflaging materials with single or mixed biological membranes, decorating or incorporating materials with membrane&#8208;derived vesicles (e.g., exosomes), and designing multifunctional materials with the structure/functions of biological membranes. In this review, we discuss the structure&#8208;function relationship of some important biological membranes and biomimetic membranes, such as various cell membranes, extracellular vesicles, and membranes from bacteria and organelles. Selected literature examples of multifunctional biomaterials derived from biological membranes for biomedical applications, such as drug and gene delivery systems, tissue repair scaffolds, bioimaging, biosensors, and biological detection, are also highlighted. These designed materials show excellent properties, such as long circulation time, disease&#8208;targeted therapy, excellent biocompatibility, and selective recognition. Finally, perspectives and challenges associated with the clinical applications of biological membrane&#8208;derived materials are discussed.

         <title>Selective Antisite Defect Formation in WS2 Monolayers via Reactive Growth on Dilute W&#8208;Au Alloy Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Defects are ubiquitous in 2D materials and can not only affect the structure and properties of the materials but can also introduce new functionalities. Methods to adjust the structure and density of defects during bottom&#8208;up synthesis are required to control the growth of 2D materials with tailored optical and electronic properties. In this paper, w e present a Au&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition approach to selectively form SW and S2W antisite defects, whereby one or two sulfur atoms substitute for a tungsten atom in WS2 monolayers. Guided by first&#8208;principles calculations, w e describe a new method that can maintain tungsten&#8208;poor growth conditions relative to sulfur via the low solubility of W atoms in a gold/W alloy, thereby significantly reducing the formation energy of the antisite defects during the growth of monolayer WS2. The atomic structure and composition of the antisite defects are unambiguously identified as SW and S2W by Z&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy, and their total concentration is statistically determined, with levels observed up to &#8764;5.0%. Scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy measurements and first&#8208;principles calculations further verified these antisite defects and revealed the localized defect states in the bandgap of WS2 monolayers that are candidates for single photon emitters. This bottom&#8208;up synthesis method to form antisite defects should apply in the synthesis of other 2D transition metal dichalcogenides.

         <title>Bioprinting of Complex Multicellular Organs with Advanced Functionality&#8212;Recent Progress and Challenges Ahead</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioprinting has emerged as a promising strategy for fabrication of functional organs in the lab. Until recently, however, this has mostly been restricted to a few miniaturized tissues with rudimentary biological activity. This review discusses a series of milestones that have paved the way for bioprinting of 3D multicellular tissues and organ with advanced levels of biological and architectural mimicry.








Abstract
Bioprinting has emerged as one of the most promising strategies for fabrication of functional organs in the lab as an alternative to transplant organs. While progress in the field has mostly been restricted to a few miniaturized tissues with minimal biological functionality until a few years ago, recent progress has advanced the concept of building three&#8208;dimensional multicellular organ complexity remarkably. This review discusses a series of milestones that have paved the way for bioprinting of tissue constructs that have advanced levels of biological and architectural functionality. Critical materials, engineering and biological challenges that are key to addressing the desirable function of engineered organs are presented. These are discussed in light of the many difficulties to replicate the heterotypic organization of multicellular solid organs, the nanoscale precision of the extracellular microenvironment in hierarchical tissues, as well as the advantages and limitations of existing bioprinting methods to adequately overcome these barriers. In summary, the advances of the field toward realistic manufacturing of functional organs have never been so extensive, and this manuscript serves as a road map for some of the recent progress and the challenges ahead.

         <title>Cr&#8208;Doped Pd Metallene Endows a Practical Formaldehyde Sensor New Limit and High Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D Cr&#8208;doped Pd metallene (Cr&#8208;Pdene) with few atomic layers as an advanced catalyst provides an anti&#8208;poisoning formaldehyde&#8208;to&#8208;CO2 means for the formaldehyde oxidation reaction. The Cr&#8208;Pdene&#8208;based practical electrochemical sensor can accurately detect ppb&#8208;level gaseous formaldehyde and micromolar&#8208;level liquid formaldehyde in indoor air and different foods with long&#8208;term stability, good repeatability, and high selectivity.








Abstract
Electrochemical sensors for detecting micromolecule organics are desirable for improving the perception of environmental quality and human health. However, currently, the electrochemical sensors for formaldehyde are substantially limited on the market due to the long&#8208;term unsolved problems of the low electrooxidation efficiency and CO poisoning issue of commercial Pd catalysts. Here, a 2D Cr&#8208;doped Pd metallene (Cr&#8208;Pdene) with few atomic layers is shown as an advanced catalyst for ultrasensitive and selective sensing of formaldehyde via a highly efficient formaldehyde electrooxidation. It is found that the doping of Cr into Pd metallene can efficiently optimize the electronic structure of Pd and weaken the interaction between Pd and CO, providing an anti&#8208;poisoning means to favor CO2 production and suppress CO adsorption. The Cr&#8208;Pdene&#8208;based electrochemical sensor exhibits one order of magnitude higher detection range and, especially, much higher anti&#8208;interference for formaldehyde than that of the conventional sensors.

     alt="Cr-Doped Pd Metallene Endows a Practical Formaldehyde Sensor New Limit and High Selectivity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2D Cr-doped Pd metallene (Cr-Pdene) with few atomic layers as an advanced catalyst provides an anti-poisoning formaldehyde-to-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; means for the formaldehyde oxidation reaction. The Cr-Pdene-based practical electrochemical sensor can accurately detect ppb-level gaseous formaldehyde and micromolar-level liquid formaldehyde in indoor air and different foods with long-term stability, good repeatability, and high selectivity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical sensors for detecting micromolecule organics are desirable for improving the perception of environmental quality and human health. However, currently, the electrochemical sensors for formaldehyde are substantially limited on the market due to the long-term unsolved problems of the low electrooxidation efficiency and CO poisoning issue of commercial Pd catalysts. Here, a 2D Cr-doped Pd metallene (Cr-Pdene) with few atomic layers is shown as an advanced catalyst for ultrasensitive and selective sensing of formaldehyde via a highly efficient formaldehyde electrooxidation. It is found that the doping of Cr into Pd metallene can efficiently optimize the electronic structure of Pd and weaken the interaction between Pd and CO, providing an anti-poisoning means to favor CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production and suppress CO adsorption. The Cr-Pdene-based electrochemical sensor exhibits one order of magnitude higher detection range and, especially, much higher anti-interference for formaldehyde than that of the conventional sensors. Most importantly, it is demonstrated that the Cr-Pdene can be integrated into commercializable wireless sensor networks or handheld instruments for promising applications relating to the environment, health, and food.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multifunctional Separator Allows Stable Cycling of Potassium Metal Anodes and of Potassium Metal Batteries</title>

Abstract
This is the first report of a multifunctional separator for potassium&#8208;metal batteries (KMBs). Double&#8208;coated tape&#8208;cast micro&#8208;scale AlF3 on polypropylene (AlF3@PP) yield state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrochemical performance: Symmetric cells are stable after 1,000 cycles (2,000 hours) at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 and 0.5 mAh cm&#8211;2, with 0.042&#160;V overpotential. Stability is maintained at 5.0&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 for 600 cycles (14,400 minutes), with 0.138&#160;V overpotential. Post&#8208;cycled plated surface is dendrite&#8208;free, while stripped surface contains smooth SEI. Conventional PP cells fail rapidly, with dendrites at plating, and &#8220;Dead Metal&#8221; and SEI clumps at stripping. Potassium hexacyanoferrate(III) cathode KMBs with AlF3@PP display the enhanced capacity retention (91% at 100 cycles versus 58%). AlF3 partially reacts with K to form an artificial SEI containing KF, AlF3 and Al2O3 phases. The AlF3@PP promotes complete electrolyte wetting and enhances uptake, improves ion conductivity, and increases ion transference number. The higher of K+ transference number is ascribed to the strong interaction between AlF3 and FSI&#8211; anions, as revealed through 19F NMR. The enhancement in wetting and performance is general, being demonstrated with ester&#8208; and ether&#8208;based solvents, with K&#8208;, Na&#8208; or Li&#8208; salts, and with different commercial separators. In full batteries AlF3 prevents Fe crossover and cycling&#8208;induced cathode pulverization.

         <title>Construction of Interfacial Electric Field via Dual&#8208;porphyrin Heterostructure Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A dual&#8208;porphyrin heterostructure is successfully constructed by coupling tetrakis (4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) zinc porphyrin (ZnTCPP) with tetrakis (4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl) porphyrin (THPP). The high photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 41.4&#160;mmol h&#8211;1 g&#8211;1 is obtained for ZnTCPP/THPP under full spectrum, which is approximately 5.1 and 17.0 times higher than that of pure ZnTCPP and THPP, respectively. The significantly enhanced activity is mainly attributed to the giant interfacial electric field formed between dual porphyrins, which greatly facilitates efficient charge separation and transfer. Meanwhile, similar conjugated structures of dual porphyrins also provide proper interface match and decrease interface defects, thus inhibiting the recombination of photoproduced carriers. By rationally combining the appropriate band structures and high&#8208;quality interfacial contact of dual porphyrins, this work provides a fresh insight into the interfacial electric field construction to improve the photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Mechanically Durable Memristor Arrays Based on a Discrete Structure Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Memristors constitute a promising functional component for information storage and in&#8208;memory computing in flexible and stretchable electronics including wearable devices, prosthetics and soft robotics. Despite tremendous efforts made to adapt conventional rigid memristors to flexible and stretchable scenarios, stretchable and mechanical damage endurable memristors have never been achieved, which is critical for maintaining reliable functions under unexpected mechanical attacks. Here, we reported the development of stretchable memristors with mechanical damage endurance based on a discreate structure design. Our memristors possess large stretchability (40%) and excellent deformability (half&#8208;fold), and retain stable performances under dynamic stretching and releasing. We show that our memristors maintain reliable functions and preserve information after extremely mechanical damages including punctures (up to 100 times) and serious torn situations (fully diagonal cut). Our structural strategy offers new opportunities for next&#8208;generation stretchable memristors with mechanical damage endurance, which is vital to achieve reliable functions for flexible and stretchable electronics even in extreme and highly dynamic environments.

         <title>Anionic Redox Regulated via Metal&#8211;Ligand Combinations in Layered Sulfides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The increasing demand for energy storage is calling for improvements in cathode performance. In traditional layered cathodes, the higher energy of metal 3d over O 2p orbital results in one band cationic redox, capacity solely from cation can not meet the needs for higher energy density. Emerging anionic redox chemistry is promising to access higher capacity. In recent studies, low&#8208;lying O non&#8208;bonding 2p orbital was designed to activate one&#8208;band oxygen redox, but still accompanied by reversibility problems like oxygen loss, irreversible cation migration and voltage decay. Herein, by regulating metal&#8208;ligand energy level, both extra capacities provided by anionic redox and highly reversible anionic redox process were realized in NaCr1&#8208;yVyS2 system. The simultaneous cationic and anionic redox of Cr/V and S was observed by in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure (XANES). Under high d&#8208;p hybridization, the strong covalent interaction stabilized the electron holes on anions, prevented irreversible dimerization and cation migration, restrained voltage hysteresis and voltage decay. Our work provides a fundamental understanding of highly reversible anionic redox in layered compounds, and demonstrated the feasibility of anionic redox chemistry based on hybridized bands with d&#8208;p covalence.

         <title>A Tri&#8208;Channel Oxide Transistor Concept for the Rapid Detection of Biomolecules Including the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike Protein</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solid&#8208;state transistor sensors that can detect biomolecules in real time are highly attractive for emerging bioanalytical applications. However, combining upscalable manufacturing with the required performance remains challenging. Here we develop an alternative biosensor transistor concept that relies on a solution&#8208;processed In2O3/ZnO semiconducting heterojunction featuring a geometrically engineered tri&#8208;channel architecture for the rapid, real&#8208;time detection of important biomolecules. The sensor combines a high electron mobility channel, attributed to the electronic properties of the In2O3/ZnO heterointerface, in close proximity to a sensing surface featuring tethered analyte receptors. The unusual tri&#8208;channel design enables strong coupling between the buried electron channel and electrostatic perturbations occurring during receptor&#8208;analyte interactions allowing for robust, real&#8208;time detection of biomolecules down to attomolar (aM) concentrations. The experimental findings are corroborated by extensive device simulations, highlighting the unique advantages of the heterojunction tri&#8208;channel design. By functionalizing the surface of the geometrically&#8208;engineered channel with SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) antibody receptors, we demonstrate real&#8208;time detection of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike S1 protein down to aM concentrations in under two minutes in physiological relevant conditions.

The sensor combines a high electron mobility channel, attributed to the electronic properties of the In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/ZnO heterointerface, in close proximity to a sensing surface featuring tethered analyte receptors. The unusual tri-channel design enables strong coupling between the buried electron channel and electrostatic perturbations occurring during receptor-analyte interactions allowing for robust, real-time detection of biomolecules down to attomolar (aM) concentrations. The experimental findings are corroborated by extensive device simulations, highlighting the unique advantages of the heterojunction tri-channel design. By functionalizing the surface of the geometrically-engineered channel with SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) antibody receptors, we demonstrate real-time detection of the SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein down to aM concentrations in under two minutes in physiological relevant conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Defect&#8208;free Metal Deposition on Two&#8208;dimensional Materials via Inkjet Printing Technology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials have many outstanding properties that make them attractive for the fabrication of electronic devices, such as high conductivity, flexibility, and transparency. However, integrating 2D materials in commercial devices and circuits is challenging because their structure and properties can be damaged during the fabrication process. Recent studies have demonstrated that standard metal deposition techniques (like electron beam evaporation and sputtering) significantly damage the atomic structure of 2D materials. Here we show that the deposition of metal via inkjet printing technology does not produce any observable damage in the atomic structure of ultra&#8208;thin 2D materials, and that it can keep a sharp interface. These conclusions are supported by abundant data obtained via atomistic simulations, transmission electron microscopy, nano&#8208;chemical metrology, and device characterization in a probe station. Our results are important for the understanding of inkjet printing technology applied to 2D materials, and they could contribute to the better design and optimization of electronic devices and circuits.

         <title>Highly Stiff and Stretchable DNA Liquid Crystalline Organogels with Super Plasticity, Ultrafast Self&#8208;healing and Magnetic Response Behaviors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
DNA&#8208;based gels are attractive materials as they allow intuitive rational design, respond to external physicochemical stimuli, and show great potential for biomedical applications. However, their relatively poor mechanical properties currently limit their technological application considerably as the latter requires mechanical integrity and tunability. With this work, we report a DNA organogel that gels through supramolecular interactions, which induce mesophase ordering, and that exhibits exceptional stretchability, deformability, plasticity, and biocompatibility. Moreover, the nature of the supramolecular bond enables complete self&#8208;healing within 3s. Most importantly, the DNA&#8208;based liquid crystalline organogels exhibit impressive ultimate tensile strengths above 1&#160;MPa, stiffness higher than 20&#160;MPa, and toughness up to 18&#160;MJ m&#8722;3, rendering our materials the strongest among reported DNA networks. In addition, we demonstrate the facile access to composite DNA materials by blending magnetic nanoparticles with the organogel matrix giving access to magnetic field induced actuation. We believe that these findings contribute significantly to the advancement of DNA gels for their use in smart materials and biomedical applications.

         <title>Bioinspired Quasi&#8208;3D Multiplexed Anti&#8208;Counterfeit Imaging via Self&#8208;Assembled and Nanoimprinted Photonic Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Innovative multiplexing technologies based on nano&#8208;optics for anti&#8208;counterfeiting have been proposed as overt (visible without tools) and covert (hidden and only visible with tools) technologies to secure products and make them difficult to counterfeit. However, most of these nano&#8208;optical anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials are metasurfaces and metamaterials with complex and expensive fabrication process, often resulting in materials that are not damage tolerant. Highly efficient anti&#8208;counterfeiting technologies with easy fabrication process are targeted for intuitive and effective authentication of banknotes, secure documents and goods packing. Here, a simple strategy exploiting self&#8208;assembling and nanoimprinting technique to fabricate a composite lattice photonic crystal architecture featuring full spatial control of light, multiplexed full&#8208;pixel imaging, and multichannel cryptography combined with customized algorithms is reported. In particular, the real&#8208;time encryption/recognition of mobile quick response codes and anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels on a postage stamp, encoded by our proposed photonic architecture, are both demonstrated. The wave optics of scattering, diffraction, and polarization process involved are also described, validated with numerical simulations and experiments. By introducing a new degree of freedom in the three&#8208;dimensional space, the multichannel image (multiplexed image) switching exhibits unprecedented variability of encryption, providing a promising roadmap to achieve larger information capacity, better security, and higher definition for the benefit of modern anti&#8208;counterfeiting security.

         <title>Energy Band Engineering by Remote Doping of Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer Leads to High&#8208;Performance IGZO/p&#8208;Si Heterostructure Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal oxide semiconductors are of great interest for enabling advanced photodetectors. However, operational instability and absence of an appropriate doping technique hinder practical development and commercialization. Here we propose a strategy to dramatically increase the conventional photodetection performance having superior stability in operational and environmental atmospheres. By performing energy band engineering through an octadecylphosphonic acid (ODPA) self&#8208;assembled monolayer based doping treatment, the proposed indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc oxide (IGZO)/p&#8208;Si hetero&#8208;interfaced devices exhibit greatly enhanced photoresponsive characteristics, including a photo&#8208;switching current ratio with a hundredfold increase, and photoresponsivity and detectivity with a 15&#8208;fold increase each.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal oxide semiconductors are of great interest for enabling advanced photodetectors. However, operational instability and absence of an appropriate doping technique hinder practical development and commercialization. Here we propose a strategy to dramatically increase the conventional photodetection performance having superior stability in operational and environmental atmospheres. By performing energy band engineering through an octadecylphosphonic acid (ODPA) self-assembled monolayer based doping treatment, the proposed indium-gallium-zinc oxide (IGZO)/&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-Si hetero-interfaced devices exhibit greatly enhanced photoresponsive characteristics, including a photo-switching current ratio with a hundredfold increase, and photoresponsivity and detectivity with a 15-fold increase each. The observed ODPA doping effects were investigated through comprehensive analysis with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and with a Kelvin probe force microscope (KPFM). Furthermore, the proposed photodetectors fabricated at a four-inch wafer-scale, and demonstrate its excellent operation robustness with consistent performance over 237 days and 20,000 testing cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Elucidating and Mitigating High&#8208;voltage Degradation Cascades in Cobalt&#8208;free LiNiO2 Lithium&#8208;ion Battery Cathodes</title>

Abstract
LiNiO2 (LNO) is a promising cathode material for next&#8208;generation Li&#8208;ion batteries due to its exceptionally high capacity and cobalt&#8208;free composition that enables more sustainable and ethical large&#8208;scale manufacturing. However, its poor cycle life at high operating voltages over 4.1&#160;V impedes its practical use, thus motivating efforts to elucidate and mitigate LiNiO2 degradation mechanisms at high states of charge. Here, we present a multi&#8208;scale exploration of high&#8208;voltage degradation cascades associated with oxygen stacking chemistry in cobalt&#8208;free LiNiO2. Lattice oxygen loss is found to play a critical role in the local O3&#8208;O1 stacking transition at high states of charge, which subsequently leads to Ni&#8208;ion migration and irreversible stacking faults during cycling. This undesirable atomic&#8208;scale structural evolution accelerates microscale electrochemical creep, cracking, and even bending of layers, ultimately resulting in macroscopic mechanical degradation of LNO particles. By employing a graphene&#8208;based hermetic surface coating, oxygen loss is attenuated in LNO at high states of charge, which suppresses the initiation of the degradation cascade and thus substantially improves the high&#8208;voltage capacity retention of LNO. Overall, this study provides mechanistic insight into the high&#8208;voltage degradation of LNO, which will inform ongoing efforts to employ cobalt&#8208;free cathodes in Li&#8208;ion battery technology.

         <title>Unravelling the Mechanism of Intermediate&#8208;Temperature CO2 Interaction with Molten NaNO3 Salt Promoted MgO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The optimization of MgO&#8208;based adsorbents as advanced CO2 capture materials is predominantly focused on their molten salt modification for which theoretical and experimental contributions provide great insights for their high CO2&#8208;capture performance. The underlying mechanism of the promotion effect of the molten salt on CO2 capture, however, is a topic of controversy among several theoretical approaches. Herein, advanced experimental characterization techniques, including in situ eTEM, in situ CO2&#8208;DRIFTS, transient 18O&#8208;isotopic exchange, and Density Functional Theory are employed to elucidate the mechanism of CO2 interaction with molten salt&#8208;modified MgO in the 250&#8211;400&#160;&#176;C range. Herein, eTEM studies using low (2&#8208;3 mbar) and high (700 mbar) CO2 pressures illustrate the dynamic evolution of the molten NaNO3 salt&#8208;promoted and unpromoted MgO carbonation with high magnification (&lt; 50&#160;nm). The formation of 18O&#8208;NaNO3 (use of 18O2), and that of C16O18O following CO2 interaction, verifies for the first time the proposed theoretical (DFT) reaction path: Conversion of NO3&#8211; (NO3&#8211; &#8594; NO2+ + O2&#8211;), adsorption of NO2+ on MgO with significant weakening of CO2 adsorption strength, and formation of [Mg2+ &#8230; O2&#8211;] ion pairs preventing the development of an impermeable MgCO3 shell, which largely increases the rate of bulk MgO carbonation compared to the unmodified MgO.

         <title>Cluster Fragments in Amorphous Phosphorus and their Evolution under Pressure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Amorphous phosphorus (a&#8208;P) has long attracted interest because of its complex atomic structure, and more recently as an anode material for batteries. However, accurately describing and understanding a&#8208;P at the atomistic level remains a challenge. Here we show that large&#8208;scale molecular&#8208;dynamics simulations, enabled by a machine learning (ML)&#8208;based interatomic potential for phosphorus, can give new insights into the atomic structure of a&#8208;P and how this structure changes under pressure. The structural model so obtained contains abundant five&#8208;membered rings, as well as more complex seven&#8208; and eight&#8208;atom clusters. Changes in the simulated first sharp diffraction peak during compression and decompression indicate a hysteresis in the recovery of medium&#8208;range order. An analysis of cluster fragments, large rings, and voids suggests that moderate pressure (up to about 5&#160;GPa) does not break the connectivity of clusters, but higher pressure does. Our work provides a starting point for further computational studies of the structure and properties of a&#8208;P, and more generally it exemplifies how ML&#8208;driven modeling can accelerate the understanding of disordered functional materials.

         <title>Deciphering nanoparticle trafficking into glioblastomas uncovers an augmented antitumor effect of metronomic chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanoparticles have been explored in glioblastomas as they can traverse the blood&#8211;brain barrier and target glioblastoma selectively. However, direct observation of nanoparticle trafficking into glioblastoma cells and their underlying intracellular fate after systemic administration remains uncharacterized. Here, based on transmission electron microscopy experiments of an intracranial glioblastoma model, we show that ligand&#8208;modified nanoparticles can traverse the blood&#8211;brain barrier, endocytose into the lysosomes of glioblastoma cells, and undergo endo&#8208;lysosomal escape upon photochemical ionization. Moreover, an optimal dose of metronomic chemotherapy using dual drug&#8208;loaded nanocarriers can induce an augmented antitumor effect directly on tumors, which was not recognized in previous studies. Metronomic chemotherapy enhances antitumor effects 3.5&#8208;fold compared with the standard chemotherapy regimen using the same accumulative dose in vivo. This study provides a conceptual framework that can be used to develop metronomic nanoparticle regimens as a safe and viable therapeutic strategy for treating glioblastomas and other advanced&#8208;stage solid tumors.

         <title>Construction of Ni(CN)2/NiSe2 Heterostructures by Stepwise Topochemical Pathways for Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Exploiting effective electrocatalysts based on elaborate heterostructures for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has been considered as a promising strategy for boosting water splitting efficiency to produce the clean&#160;energy&#8212;hydrogen. However, constructing catalytically active heterostructures with novel composition and architecture remains poorly developed due to the synthetic challenge. In this work, we demonstrate that unique Ni(CN)2/NiSe2 heterostructures, composed of single&#8208;crystalline Ni(CN)2 nanoplates surrounded by crystallographically aligned NiSe2 nanosatellites, can be created from nickel&#8208;based Hofmann&#8208;type coordination polymers through stepwise topochemical pathways. When employed as the OER electrocatalyst, the Ni(CN)2/NiSe2 heterostructures show enhanced performance, which could be attributed to optimized geometric and electronic structures of the catalytic sites endowed by the synergy between the two components. This work demonstrates a rational synthetic route for creating a novel Ni&#8208;based OER electrocatalyst that possesses nanoscale heterostructure, whose composition, spatial organization, and interface configuration can be finely manipulated.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Angiogenic Nanomicelles For the Topical Delivery of Aflibercept to Treat Retinal Neovascular Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The traditional intravitreal injection delivery of anti&#8208;vascular endothelial growth factor (anti&#8208;VEGF) to the posterior segment of the eye for treatment of retinal diseases is invasive and associated with sight&#8208;threatening complications. To avoid such complications, there has been significant interest in developing polymers for topical drug delivery to the retina. This study reports a nanomicelle drug delivery system made of a co&#8208;polymer EPC (nEPCs), which is capable of delivering aflibercept to the posterior segment topically through corneal&#8208;scleral routes. EPC is comprised of polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylglycol (PPG) and polycaprolactone (PCL) segments. In this study, aflibercept&#8208;loaded nEPCs (nEPCs+A) is capable of penetrating the cornea in ex&#8208;vivo porcine eye models and deliver a clinically significant amount of aflibercept to the retina of laser&#8208;induced choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) murine models, causing CNV regression. nEPCs+A also demonstrates biocompatibility in&#8208;vitro and in&#8208;vivo. Interestingly, this study also suggests that nEPCs have intrinsic anti&#8208;angiogenic properties. The ability to deliver anti&#8208;VEGF drugs and the intrinsic anti&#8208;angiogenic properties of nEPCs may result in synergistic effects which can be harnessed for effective therapeutics. nEPCs may be a promising topical anti&#8208;VEGF delivery platform for the treatment of retinal diseases.

&lt;p&gt;The traditional intravitreal injection delivery of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) to the posterior segment of the eye for treatment of retinal diseases is invasive and associated with sight-threatening complications. To avoid such complications, there has been significant interest in developing polymers for topical drug delivery to the retina. This study reports a nanomicelle drug delivery system made of a co-polymer EPC (nEPCs), which is capable of delivering aflibercept to the posterior segment topically through corneal-scleral routes. EPC is comprised of polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylglycol (PPG) and polycaprolactone (PCL) segments. In this study, aflibercept-loaded nEPCs (nEPCs+A) is capable of penetrating the cornea in ex-vivo porcine eye models and deliver a clinically significant amount of aflibercept to the retina of laser-induced choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) murine models, causing CNV regression. nEPCs+A also demonstrates biocompatibility in-vitro and in-vivo. Interestingly, this study also suggests that nEPCs have intrinsic anti-angiogenic properties. The ability to deliver anti-VEGF drugs and the intrinsic anti-angiogenic properties of nEPCs may result in synergistic effects which can be harnessed for effective therapeutics. nEPCs may be a promising topical anti-VEGF delivery platform for the treatment of retinal diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Zinc(I) Active Sites to Accelerate Nitrogen Reduction Kinetics for Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction (NRR) to produce ammonia (NH3) at ambient conditions is a promising alternative for the Haber&#8208;Bosch process. However, developing highly active and stable NRR catalysts to replace precious metals remains challenging. Herein, we report an unusual NRR electrocatalyst with a single Zn(I) site supported on hollow porous N&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers (Zn1N&#8208;C). The Zn1N&#8208;C nanofibers exhibit an outstanding NRR activity with a high NH3 yield rate of &#8764;16.1&#160;&#956;g NH3 h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 at &#8208;0.3&#160;V and Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 11.8% in alkaline media, surpassing other previously reported carbon&#8208;based NRR electrocatalysts in which the transition metal is dispersed atomically and anchored at nitrogen (TM&#8208;Nx) sites. 15N2 isotope labeling experiments confirm that the feeding gas is the only nitrogen source in the production of NH3. Structural characterizations reveal that atomically dispersed Zn(I) sites with Zn&#8208;N4 moieties serve as real active sites, and nearby graphitic N site synergistically facilitates the NRR activity. In situ attenuated total reflectance&#8208;Fourier transform infrared measurement and theoretical calculation demonstrate that the formation of initial *NNH intermediate is the rate&#8208;limiting step toward NH3 generation. It also indicates the graphitic N atom adjacent to the tetracoordinate Zn&#8208;N4 center significantly lowers the energy barrier for this process to accelerate hydrogenation kinetics.

         <title>High Performing Self&#8208;Powered Photosensing and Reconfigurable Pyro&#8208;photoelectric Memory with Ferroelectric Hafnium Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
With highly diverse multifunctional properties, hafnium oxide (HfO2) has attracted considerable attention not only because of its potential to address fundamental questions about material behaviors, but also its potential for applied perspectives like ferroelectric memory, transistors, and pyroelectric sensors.&#160;However, effective harvesting of the pyro&#8208;photoelectric effect of HfO2 to develop high&#8208;performing self&#8208;biased photosensors and electric writable and optical readable memory has yet to be developed. Here, we developed a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept HfO2&#8208;based self&#8208;powered and ultrafast (response time &#8764; 60 &#956;s) infrared pyroelectric sensor with a responsivity of up to 68 &#956;A&#8201;W&#8722;1. In particular, temporal infrared light illumination&#8208;induced surface heating and, in turn, change in spontaneous polarization are attributed to robust pyro&#8208;photocurrent generation. Further, controllable suspension and reestablishment of self&#8208;biased pyro&#8208;photocurrent response with a short electric pulse is demonstrated, which offers a conceptually new kind of photo&#8208;readable memory. Potentially, our novel approach opens a new avenue for designing on&#8208;demand pyro&#8208;phototronic response over a desired area and offers the opportunity to utilize it for various applications, including in&#8208;memory storage, neuromorphic vision sensors, classification, and emergency alert systems.

         <title>A Universal Nonhalogenated Polymer Donor for High&#8208;Performance Organic Photovoltaic Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two nonhalogenated polymers, PB1 and PB2, with different side&#8208;chain orientations and deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels are reported. In organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells, PB1 only produces a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.3%, while PB2 gives an outstanding PCE of 17.7%. More importantly, PB2 has good compatibility with various electron acceptors. PB2 achieves excellent PCEs of 18.4% and 27.1% for ternary OPV cells and indoor light photovoltaic devices, respectively.








Abstract
Nonhalogenated polymers have great potential in the commercialization of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells due to their advantage in low&#8208;cost preparation. However, non&#8208;halogenated polymers usually have high highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels and inferior self&#8208;aggregation properties in solution, thus resulting in low power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Herein, two nonhalogenated polymers, PB1 and PB2, are prepared. When the polymers are used to fabricate OPV cells with BTP&#8208;eC9, the PB1&#8208;based device only gives a PCE of 5.3%, while the PB2&#8208;based device shows an outstanding PCE of 17.7%. After the introduction of PBDB&#8208;TF as the third component, the PB2:PBDB&#8208;TF:BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based device with an optimal weight ratio of 0.5:0.5:1 achieves a PCE up to 18.4%. More importantly, PB2 exhibits good compatibility with various nonfullerene acceptors to achieve better PCEs than those of classical polymer (PBDB&#8208;T and PBDB&#8208;TF)&#8208;based devices. When PB2 is combined with a wide&#8208;bandgap electron acceptor (F&#8208;BTA3), this device shows excellent PCE of 27.1% and 24.6% for 1 and 10 cm2 devices, respectively, under light intensity of 1000 lux light&#8208;emitting diode illumination. These results provide new insight in the rational design of novel nonhalogenated polymer donors for further development of low&#8208;cost materials and broadening the application of OPV cells.

         <title>Ultralow Thermal Conductivity, Multiband Electronic Structure and High Thermoelectric Figure of Merit in TlCuSe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconductors with ultralow lattice thermal conductivities and high power factors at the same time are scarce but fundamentally interesting in understanding thermoelectric energy conversion. TlCuSe exhibiting intrinsically ultralow thermal conductivity (0.25 W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;1), a high power factor (11.6 &#956;W cm&#8211;1 K&#8211;1), and a high figure of merit ZT (1.9) at 643 K is described.








Abstract
The entanglement of lattice thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, and Seebeck coefficient complicates the process of optimizing thermoelectric performance in most thermoelectric materials.

         <title>Additives for Ambient 3D Printing with Visible Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced polymerization of commercially relevant acrylics and concomitant 3D printing under ambient conditions is made possible with thiol additives acting as oxygen scavengers. The tadpole and frog are 3D printed using energy efficient red light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), metaphorically representing the transformative advance that allows additive manufacturing (or breathing for the frog) in air.








Abstract
With 3D printing, the desire is to be &#8220;limited only by imagination,&#8221; and although remarkable advancements have been made in recent years, the scope of printable materials remains narrow compared to other forms of manufacturing. Light&#8208;driven polymerization methods for 3D printing are particularly attractive due to unparalleled speed and resolution, yet the reliance on high&#8208;energy UV/violet light in contemporary processes limits the number of compatible materials due to pervasive absorption, scattering, and degradation at these short wavelengths. Such issues can be addressed with visible&#8208;light photopolymerizations. However, these lower&#8208;energy methods often suffer from slow reaction times and sensitivity to oxygen, precluding their utility in 3D printing processes that require rapid hardening (curing) to maximize build speed and resolution. Herein, multifunctional thiols are identified as simple additives to enable rapid high&#8208;resolution visible&#8208;light 3D printing under ambient (atmospheric O2) conditions that rival modern UV/violet&#8208;based technology. The present process is universal, providing access to commercially relevant acrylic resins with a range of disparate mechanical responses from strong and stiff to soft and extensible. Pushing forward, the insight presented within this study will inform the development of next&#8208;generation 3D&#8208;printing materials, such as multicomponent hydrogels and composites.

         <title>Direct Chemical Vapor Deposition Synthesis of Porous Single&#8208;Layer Graphene Membranes with High Gas Permeances and Selectivities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous single&#8208;layer graphene membranes for gas separation are synthesized by one&#8208;step chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Highly dense gas&#8208;sieving pores are created in graphene by tuning the CVD parameters. The resulting graphene membranes exhibit record&#8208;high H2/CH4 separation performance to date: H2/CH4 selectivity &gt;&#160;2000 while H2 permeance &gt;&#160;4000 GPU.








Abstract
Single&#8208;layer graphene containing molecular&#8208;sized in&#8208;plane pores is regarded as a promising membrane material for high&#8208;performance gas separations due to its atomic thickness and low gas transport resistance. However, typical etching&#8208;based pore generation methods cannot decouple pore nucleation and pore growth, resulting in a trade&#8208;off between high areal pore density and high selectivity. In contrast, intrinsic pores in graphene formed during chemical vapor deposition are not created by etching. Therefore, intrinsically porous graphene can exhibit high pore density while maintaining its gas selectivity. In this work, the density of intrinsic graphene pores is systematically controlled for the first time, while appropriate pore sizes for gas sieving are precisely maintained. As a result, single&#8208;layer graphene membranes with the highest H2/CH4 separation performances recorded to date (H2 permeance &gt;&#160;4000 GPU and H2/CH4 selectivity &gt;&#160;2000) are fabricated by manipulating growth temperature, precursor concentration, and non&#8208;covalent decoration of the graphene surface. Moreover, it is identified that nanoscale molecular fouling of the graphene surface during gas separation where graphene pores are partially blocked by hydrocarbon contaminants under experimental conditions, controls both selectivity and temperature dependent permeance. Overall, the direct synthesis of porous single&#8208;layer graphene exploits its tremendous potential as high&#8208;performance gas&#8208;sieving membranes.

         <title>Suppressing Interface Strain for Eliminating Double&#8208;Slope Behaviors: Towards Ideal Conformable Polymer Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interface strain between film and substrate is first found to play the crucial role in determining device ideality. The release of strain by peeling can reduce the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance, which decreases oxygen doped carriers, thereby realizing ideal polymer field&#8208;effect transistors (PFETs). The work clarifies the effect of interface strain on the device ideality, offering useful guidance for constructing ideal conformable PFETs.








Abstract
High&#8208;mobility polymer field&#8208;effect transistors (PFETs) are being actively explored for applications in soft electronic skin and low&#8208;cost flexible displays because of their superior solution processability, mechanical flexibility, and stretchability. However, most of high&#8208;mobility PFETs often deviate from the idealized behavior with variable mobility, large threshold voltage, and high off&#8208;state current, which masks their intrinsic properties and significantly impedes their practical applications. Here, it is first revealed that interface strain between polymer thin film and rigid substrate plays a crucial role in determining the ideality of PFETs, and demonstrate that various ideal conformable PFETs can be successfully fabricated by releasing strain. It is found that strain in film can be released by one&#8208;step peeling strategy, which can reduce &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking distance and suppress generation of oxygen doped carriers, thereby obtaining linearly injected charge carriers and decreased carrier concentration in channel, eventually realizing ideal PFETs. More impressively, the fabricated ideal conformable PFET array displays outstanding conformability to curved objects, and meanwhile showing excellent organic light&#8208;emitting display driving capability. The work clarifies the effect of the interface strain on the device ideality, and strain can be effectively released by a facile peeling strategy, thus offering useful guidance for the construction of ideal conformable PFETs.

         <title>Miniaturized VIS&#8208;NIR Spectrometers Based on Narrowband and Tunable Transmission Cavity Organic Photodetectors with Ultrahigh Specific Detectivity above 1014 Jones</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept of innovative transmission cavities combined with organic photodetectors (OPDs) is proposed to achieve narrowband photodetection from the VIS to the NIR region. With this approach, an ultrahigh specific detectivity above 1014 Jones is achieved and is integrated into a miniaturized spectrometer, representing a significant step toward applying OPDs as an attractive alternative for mobile spectrometric sensing.








Abstract
Spectroscopic photodetection plays a key role in many emerging applications such as context&#8208;aware optical sensing, wearable biometric monitoring, and biomedical imaging. Photodetectors based on organic semiconductors open many new possibilities in this field. However, ease of processing, tailorable optoelectronic properties, and sensitivity for faint light are still significant challenges. Here, the authors report a novel concept for a tunable spectral detector by combining an innovative transmission cavity structure with organic absorbers to yield narrowband organic photodetection in the wavelength range of 400&#8211;1100&#160;nm, fabricated in a full&#8208;vacuum process. Benefiting from this strategy, one of the best performed narrowband organic photodetectors is achieved with a finely wavelength&#8208;selective photoresponse (full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum of &#8776;40&#160;nm), ultrahigh specific detectivity above 1014 Jones, the maximum response speed of 555&#160;kHz, and a large dynamic range up to 168&#160;dB. Particularly, an array of transmission cavity organic photodetectors is monolithically integrated on a small substrate to showcase a miniaturized spectrometer application, and a true proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept transmission spectrum measurement is successfully demonstrated.

     alt="Miniaturized VIS-NIR Spectrometers Based on Narrowband and Tunable Transmission Cavity Organic Photodetectors with Ultrahigh Specific Detectivity above 1014 Jones"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new concept of innovative transmission cavities combined with organic photodetectors (OPDs) is proposed to achieve narrowband photodetection from the VIS to the NIR region. With this approach, an ultrahigh specific detectivity above 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; Jones is achieved and is integrated into a miniaturized spectrometer, representing a significant step toward applying OPDs as an attractive alternative for mobile spectrometric sensing.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spectroscopic photodetection plays a key role in many emerging applications such as context-aware optical sensing, wearable biometric monitoring, and biomedical imaging. Photodetectors based on organic semiconductors open many new possibilities in this field. However, ease of processing, tailorable optoelectronic properties, and sensitivity for faint light are still significant challenges. Here, the authors report a novel concept for a tunable spectral detector by combining an innovative transmission cavity structure with organic absorbers to yield narrowband organic photodetection in the wavelength range of 400&#8211;1100&#160;nm, fabricated in a full-vacuum process. Benefiting from this strategy, one of the best performed narrowband organic photodetectors is achieved with a finely wavelength-selective photoresponse (full-width-at-half-maximum of &#8776;40&#160;nm), ultrahigh specific detectivity above 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; Jones, the maximum response speed of 555&#160;kHz, and a large dynamic range up to 168&#160;dB. Particularly, an array of transmission cavity organic photodetectors is monolithically integrated on a small substrate to showcase a miniaturized spectrometer application, and a true proof-of-concept transmission spectrum measurement is successfully demonstrated. The excellent performance, the simple device fabrication as well as the possibility of high integration of this new concept challenge state-of-the-art low-noise silicon photodetectors and will mature the spectroscopic photodetection into technological realities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Crystallographic&#8208;Site&#8208;Specific Structural Engineering Enables Extraordinary Electrochemical Performance of High&#8208;Voltage LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 Spinel Cathodes for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Crystallographic&#8208;site&#8208;specific structural engineering is performed on the cathode material structure for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, aiming at the root causes of the instability based on the fundamental structure/function relationship. The high&#8208;voltage spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) cathode with Fd3&#175;m space group symmetry is employed as a representative, of which two issue&#8208;involved crystallographic sites are directly and simultaneously addressed, contributing to an extraordinarily excellent battery performance.








Abstract
The development of reliable and safe high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries is hindered by the structural instability of cathode materials during cycling, arising as a result of detrimental phase transformations occurring at high operating voltages alongside the loss of active materials induced by transition metal dissolution. Originating from the fundamental structure/function relation of battery materials, the authors purposefully perform crystallographic&#8208;site&#8208;specific structural engineering on electrode material structure, using the high&#8208;voltage LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) cathode as a representative, which directly addresses the root source of structural instability of the Fd3&#175;m structure. By employing Sb as a dopant to modify the specific issue&#8208;involved 16c and 16d sites simultaneously, the authors successfully transform the detrimental two&#8208;phase reaction occurring at high&#8208;voltage into a preferential solid&#8208;solution reaction and significantly suppress the loss of Mn from the LNMO structure. The modified LNMO material delivers an impressive 99% of its theoretical specific capacity at 1 C, and maintains 87.6% and 72.4% of initial capacity after 1500 and 3000 cycles, respectively. The issue&#8208;tracing site&#8208;specific structural tailoring demonstrated for this material will facilitate the rapid development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Nanosecond&#8208;Pulsed Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes at High Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;speed pulsed operation of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes is achieved with a rise time of 1.2&#160;ns. The temporal response provides access to transient charge carrier dynamics under electrical excitation, revealing several new electroluminescence quenching pathways. Furthermore, the integration of Bragg gratings enhances the forward radiance more than two&#8208;fold, with a maximum of approximately 1200 kW sr&#8722;1m&#8722;2 at 8.5 kA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
While metal&#8208;halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) hold the potential for a new generation of display and lighting technology, their slow operation speed and response time limit their application scope. Here, high&#8208;speed PeLEDs driven by nanosecond electrical pulses with a rise time of 1.2&#160;ns are reported with a maximum radiance of approximately 480 kW sr&#8722;1&#8197;m&#8722;2 at 8.3 kA cm&#8722;2, and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1% at approximately 10 kA cm&#8722;2, through improved device configuration designs and material considerations. Enabled by the fast operation of PeLEDs, the temporal response provides access to transient charge carrier dynamics under electrical excitation, revealing several new electroluminescence quenching pathways. Finally, integrated distributed feedback (DFB) gratings are explored, which facilitate more directional light emission with a maximum radiance of approximately 1200 kW&#8197;sr&#8722;1&#8197;m&#8722;2 at 8.5 kA cm&#8722;2, a more than two&#8208;fold enhancement to forward radiation output.

Magneto&#8208;responsive microneedle&#8208;structured robots are developed by a building&#8208;block stacking inspired multistage 3D fabrication strategy. Such microrobots contain a polarized magnetic substrate for remote guidance, needle tips for intestinal drug release, and a separable connection for tip&#8211;substrate detachment and substrate excretion. These microrobots perform well in delivering insulin to pigs and blood glucose control, indicating their potentials in effective oral macromolecule administration.








Abstract
Oral administration is the most convenient and commonly used approach for drug delivery, while it is still a challenge to overcome the complicated gastrointestinal barriers and realize efficient macromolecular drug absorption. Here, novel magneto&#8208;responsive microneedle robots are presented for efficient oral delivery of versatile macromolecules. These microneedle robots with three components of the magnetic substrate, the separable connection, and tips are generated by a Lego&#8208;brick&#8208;stacking&#8208;inspired multistage 3D fabrication strategy. With the assistance of commercial enteric capsule encapsulation, they can be taken orally and be released when entering the small intestine. Benefitting from their polarized magnetic substrate, the tips of the microneedle robots can orient to the small intestinal wall, overcome the barriers, insert into the tissue, and deliver encapsulated actives under specific magnetic fields. Besides, after the separable connection degrades, the tips can be left inside the tissue for continuous actives release, and the magnetic substrate can be excreted safely. Based on these features, the practical values of the microneedle robots are demonstrated by using them to orally deliver insulin and efficiently regulate the blood glucose of pigs. It is believed that the proposed microneedle robots can orally deliver diverse macromolecules and thus open a new chapter for oral administration.

         <title>Efficient and Stable CsPbI3 Inorganic Perovskite Photovoltaics Enabled by Crystal Secondary Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect&#8208;triggered phase degradation has become the main issue in the field of inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite. A crystal secondary growth of inorganic perovskites induced by a solid&#8208;state reaction to achieve defect compensation in CsPbI3 perovskite is demonstrated. Finally, the defect&#8208;compensated CsPbI3&#8208;based solar cell delivers 20.04% efficiency with excellent operational stability.








Abstract
Defect&#8208;triggered phase degradation is generally considered as the main issue that causes phase instability and limited device performance for CsPbI3 inorganic perovskites. Here, a defect compensation in CsPbI3 perovskite through crystal secondary growth of inorganic perovskites is demonstrated, and highly efficient inorganic photovoltaics are realized. This secondary growth is achieved by a solid&#8208;state reaction between a bromine salt and defective CsPbI3 perovskite. Upon solid&#8208;state reaction, the Br&#8722; ions can diffuse over the entire CsPbI3 perovskite layer to heal the undercoordinated Pb2+ and conduct certain solid&#8208;state I/Br ion exchange reaction, while the organic cations can potentially heal the Cs+ cation vacancies through coupling with [PbI6]4&#8722; octahedra. The carrier dynamics confirm that this crystal secondary growth can realize defect compensation in CsPbI3. The as&#8208;achieved defect&#8208;compensated CsPbI3 not only improves the charge dynamics but also enhances the photoactive phase stability. Finally, the CsPbI3&#8208;based solar cell delivers 20.04% efficiency with excellent operational stability. Overall, this work proposes a novel concept of defect compensation in inorganic perovskites through crystal secondary growth induced by solid&#8208;state reaction that is promising for various optoelectronic applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defect-triggered phase degradation is generally considered as the main issue that causes phase instability and limited device performance for CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; inorganic perovskites. Here, a defect compensation in CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite through crystal secondary growth of inorganic perovskites is demonstrated, and highly efficient inorganic photovoltaics are realized. This secondary growth is achieved by a solid-state reaction between a bromine salt and defective CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite. Upon solid-state reaction, the Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions can diffuse over the entire CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite layer to heal the undercoordinated Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and conduct certain solid-state I/Br ion exchange reaction, while the organic cations can potentially heal the Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation vacancies through coupling with [PbI&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; octahedra. The carrier dynamics confirm that this crystal secondary growth can realize defect compensation in CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The as-achieved defect-compensated CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; not only improves the charge dynamics but also enhances the photoactive phase stability. Finally, the CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based solar cell delivers 20.04% efficiency with excellent operational stability. Overall, this work proposes a novel concept of defect compensation in inorganic perovskites through crystal secondary growth induced by solid-state reaction that is promising for various optoelectronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Robust Jumping Actuator with a Shrimp&#8208;Shell Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is highly desirable to develop compact and robust jumping robots that can withstand severe conditions. In this work, a film jumping actuator is reported, which exhibits shrimp&#8208;shell architecture, from a conjugated ladder polymer (cLP) connected by carbon nanotube (CNT) sheets. The hierarchical porous structure ensures fast absorption and desorption of organic vapor, thereby achieving a high response rate.








Abstract
It is highly desirable to develop compact&#8208; and robust&#8208;film jumping robots that can withstand severe conditions. Besides, the demands for strong actuation force, large bending curvature in a short response time, and good environmental tolerance are significant challenges to the material design. To address these challenges, this paper reports the fabrication of a thin&#8208;film jumping actuator, which exhibits a shrimp&#8208;shell architecture, from a conjugated ladder polymer (cLP) that is connected by carbon nanotube (CNT) sheets. The hierarchical porous structure ensures the fast absorption and desorption of organic vapor, thereby achieving a high response rate. The actuator does not exhibit shape distortion at temperatures of up to 225&#160;&#176;C and in concentrated sulfuric acid, as well as when immersed in many organic solvents. This work avails a new design strategy for high&#8208;performance actuators that function under harsh and complicated conditions.

         <title>Dendritic CsSnI3 for Efficient and Flexible Near&#8208;Infrared Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The injection and transport capacity of holes is significantly stronger than electrons in CsSnI3&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes; therefore, the charge injection is manipulated by preparing a dendritic CsSnI3 structure, increasing the interface area of the perovskite/electron&#8208;transporter and the probability of radiative recombination. As a result, an efficient device is achieved with a record external quantum efficiency of 5.4%.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic and lead&#8208;free CsSnI3 is emerging as one of the most promising candidates for near&#8208;infrared perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (NIR Pero&#8208;LEDs), which find practical applications including facial recognition, biomedical apparatus, night vision camera, and Light Fidelity. However, in the CsSnI3&#8208;based Pero&#8208;LEDs, the holes injection is significantly higher than that of electrons, resulting in unbalanced charge injection, undesired exciton dissipation, and poor device performance. Herein, it is proposed to manage charge injection and recombination behavior by tuning the interface area of perovskite and charge&#8208;transporter. A dendritic CsSnI3 structure is prepared on the hole&#8208;transporter, only making a bottom contact with the hole&#8208;transporter and exposing all other available crystal surfaces to the electron&#8208;transporter. In other words, the interface area of perovskite/electron&#8208;transporter is significantly higher than that of perovskite/hole&#8208;transporter. Moreover, the embedding interface of perovskite/electron&#8208;transporter can spatially confine holes and electrons, increasing the radiation recombination. By taking advantage of the dendritic structure, efficient lead&#8208;free NIR Pero&#8208;LEDs are achieved with a record external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.4%. More importantly, the dendritic structure shows great superiorities in flexible devices, for there is almost no morphology change after 2000&#8208;cycles of bends, and the fabricated Pero&#8208;LEDs can keep 93.4% of initial EQEs after 50&#8208;cycles of bends.

         <title>Secondary Bonding Channel Design Induces Intercalation Pseudocapacitance toward Ultrahigh&#8208;Capacity and High&#8208;Rate Organic Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional organic electrodes rely on functional groups. In this work, the organic compound 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid is used as an example to reveal that secondary bonds for molecular stacking are connected together to form 3D channels for Li+&#8208;ion intercalation. The secondary bonding channels comprising &#63743;C&#63742;C&#63743; redox sites are identified to display intercalation pseudocapacitance, playing an important role in increasing specific capacity and rate capability.








Abstract
Organic electrode materials have shown extraordinary promise for green and sustainable electrochemical energy storage devices, but usually suffer from low specific capacity and poor rate capability, which is largely caused by inactive components and diffusion&#8208;controlled Li+ intercalation. Herein, high&#8208;rate Li+ intercalation pseudocapacitance in organic molecular crystals is achieved through introducing weak secondary bonding channels, far exceeding their theoretical capacity based on redox chemistry at functional groups. The authors&#8217; combined experimentally electrochemical characterization with first&#8208;principles calculations show that the heterocyclic organic molecule 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (BPDCA) crystal permits a four&#8208;electron redox reaction at conventional &#63743;C&#63742;O and &#63743;C&#63742;N groups and a six&#8208;electron intercalation pseudocapacitance along conjugated alkene hydrogen bonding channels (&#63743;H2NC5&#63743;H&#8943;O&#63742;C(OH)&#63743;) and heterocyclic aromatic stacking channels (&#63743;C5H3N&#8943;NH3C5&#63743;). The BPDCA electrode delivers an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 1206&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8208;1 at 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&#8208;1 and an exceptional rate capability. A 4.8&#160;V high&#8208;energy/power&#8208;density BPDCA anode&#8208;based hybrid Li&#8208;ion capacitor is thus realized. This work opens a new avenue for developing organic intercalation pseudocapacitive materials via secondary bonding structure design.

         <title>Monolayer Support Control and Precise Colloidal Nanocrystals Demonstrate Metal&#8211;Support Interactions in Heterogeneous Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interactions between coexisting metal and metal oxide phases determine the properties of heterogeneous catalysts. Atomic layer deposition and colloidal nanocrystal synthesis are combined to precisely control catalyst properties with sub&#8208;nanometer precision. Significant enhancements are observed in methane combustion activity after modification of SiO2 support with only one monolayer of Al2O3, and surface versus bulk contributions of metal&#8211;support interactions are explored.








Abstract
Electronic and geometric interactions between active and support phases are critical in determining the activity of heterogeneous catalysts, but metal&#8211;support interactions are challenging to study. Here, it is demonstrated how the combination of the monolayer&#8208;controlled formation using atomic layer deposition (ALD) and colloidal nanocrystal synthesis methods leads to catalysts with sub&#8208;nanometer precision of active and support phases, thus allowing for the study of the metal&#8211;support interactions in detail. The use of this approach in developing a fundamental understanding of support effects in Pd&#8208;catalyzed methane combustion is demonstrated. Uniform Pd nanocrystals are deposited onto Al2O3/SiO2 spherical supports prepared with control over morphology and Al2O3 layer thicknesses ranging from sub&#8208;monolayer to a &#8776;4&#160;nm thick uniform coating. Dramatic changes in catalytic activity depending on the coverage and structure of Al2O3 situated at the Pd/Al2O3 interface are observed, with even a single monolayer of alumina contributing an order of magnitude increase in reaction rate. By building the Pd/Al2O3 interface up layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer and using uniform Pd nanocrystals, this work demonstrates the importance of controlled and tunable materials in determining metal&#8211;support interactions and catalyst activity.

&lt;p&gt;Electronic and geometric interactions between active and support phases are critical in determining the activity of heterogeneous catalysts, but metal&#8211;support interactions are challenging to study. Here, it is demonstrated how the combination of the monolayer-controlled formation using atomic layer deposition (ALD) and colloidal nanocrystal synthesis methods leads to catalysts with sub-nanometer precision of active and support phases, thus allowing for the study of the metal&#8211;support interactions in detail. The use of this approach in developing a fundamental understanding of support effects in Pd-catalyzed methane combustion is demonstrated. Uniform Pd nanocrystals are deposited onto Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; spherical supports prepared with control over morphology and Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; layer thicknesses ranging from sub-monolayer to a &#8776;4&#160;nm thick uniform coating. Dramatic changes in catalytic activity depending on the coverage and structure of Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; situated at the Pd/Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; interface are observed, with even a single monolayer of alumina contributing an order of magnitude increase in reaction rate. By building the Pd/Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; interface up layer-by-layer and using uniform Pd nanocrystals, this work demonstrates the importance of controlled and tunable materials in determining metal&#8211;support interactions and catalyst activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Congener&#8208;Induced Sulfur&#8208;Related Metabolism Interference Therapy Promoted by Photothermal Sensitization for Combating Bacteria</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanomaterial anti&#8208;implant&#8208;associated infection therapy named congener&#8208;induced sulfur&#8208;related metabolism interference therapy is proposed, based on the competitive role of selenium (Se) and sulfur (S) in bacteria metabolism as congeners. The original nanodrug MnSe2 is devised to generate permeable H2Se into bacteria and eliminated them by specific destruction of metabolic homeostasis with the promotion of photothermal sensitization.








Abstract
Metabolic homeostasis is vital for individual cells to keep alive. Stronger metabolic homeostasis allows bacteria to survive in vivo and do persistent harm to hosts, which is especially typical in implant&#8208;associated infection (IAI) with biofilm intervention. Herein, based on the competitive role of selenium (Se) and sulfur (S) in bacteria metabolism as congeners, a congener&#8208;induced sulfur&#8208;related metabolism interference therapy (SMIT) eradicating IAI is proposed by specific destruction of bacteria metabolic homeostasis. The original nanodrug manganese diselenide (MnSe2) is devised to generate permeable H2Se in bacteria, triggered by the acidic microenvironment. H2Se, the congener substitution of H2S, as a bacteria&#8208;specific intermediate metabolite, can embed itself into the H2S&#8208;utilization pathway and further alternatively disrupt the downstream sulfur&#8208;related metabolism state inside bacteria. A proteomic study indicates ribosome&#8208;related proteins are heavily downregulated and the basic metabolic pathways are mainly disordered after SMIT, revealing the destruction of bacteria metabolic homeostasis. The efficiency of SMIT is significantly promoted with the mild temperature sensitization provided by the photothermal treatment (PTT) of MnSe2 nanoparticles, verified by the proteomic study and the anti&#8208;IAI effect in vitro and in vivo. With the intelligent nanodrug, a PTT&#8208;promoted SMIT strategy against IAI is provided and a new insight into the interference design toward metabolic homeostasis with biochemical similarity is demonstrated.

         <title>Additively Manufactured Deformation&#8208;Recoverable and Broadband Sound&#8208;Absorbing Microlattice Inspired by the Concept of Traditional Perforated Panels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on traditional perforated panel concepts, a novel broadband sound&#8208;absorbing microlattice with impact&#8208;recovery multifunctionality is presented. The microlattice boasts high averaged absorption coefficients of 0.77 with mechanisms attributing to synergistic impedance matching and a combination of viscous, thermal, and structural damping dissipation. It is also pseudo&#8208;reusable with high strain recovery at 30% with no degradation of sound absorption observed.








Abstract
Noise pollution is a highly detrimental daily health hazard. Sound absorbers, such as the traditionally used perforated panels, find widespread applications. Nonetheless, modern product designs call for material novelties with enhanced performance and multifunctionality. The advent of additive manufacturing has brought about the possibilities of functional materials design to be based on structures rather than chemistry. With this in mind, herein, the traditional concept of perforated panels is revisited and is incorporated with additive manufacturing for the development of a novel microlattice&#8208;based sound absorber with additional impact resistance multifunctionality. The structurally optimized microlattice presents excellent broadband absorption with an averaged experimental absorption coefficient of 0.77 across a broad frequency range from 1000 to 6300&#160;Hz. Extensive simulation and experiments reveal absorption mechanisms to be based on viscous flow, thermal and structural damping dissipations while broadband capabilities to be on multiple resonance modes working in tandem. High deformation recovery up to 30% strain is also possible from the strut&#8208;based design and viscoelasticity of the base material. Overall, the excellent properties of the microlattice overcome tradeoffs commonly found in conventional absorbers. Additionally, this work aims to present a new paradigm: revisiting old concepts for the developments of novel materials using contemporary methods.

         <title>Ultrafast Interlayer Charge Separation, Enhanced Visible&#8208;Light Absorption, and Tunable Overpotential in Twisted Graphitic Carbon Nitride Bilayers for Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking g&#8208;C3N4 as a representative example, it is theoretically found that twisted bilayers are endowed with good charge separation, ultrafast interlayer charge transfer, and enhanced visible&#8208;light absorption. Due to the induced large moir&#233; potentials, the overpotentials of HER and OER on the twisted bilayers are significantly reduced. Therefore, twist is better and of great potential in catalysis.








Abstract
Moir&#233; pattern superlattice formed by 2D van der Waals layered structures have attracted great attention for diverse applications. In experiments, the enhancement of catalytic performance in twisted bilayer systems is reported while its mechanism remains unclear. From high&#8208;accuracy first&#8208;principles and time&#8208;dependent ab initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics calculations, ultrafast interlayer charge transfer within 120 fs, excellent charge separation, improved visible&#8208;light absorption, and satisfactory overpotentials for the hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions in twisted graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) bilayers are found, which are beneficial to photocatalytic, photo&#8208;electrocatalytic, or electrocatalytic water splitting. This work provides insightful guidance to advanced nanocatalysis based on twisted layered materials.

         <title>Atomic Scale Control and Visualization of Topological Quantum Phase Transition in &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymers Driven by Their Length</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Length control of &#960;&#8208;conjugated pentacene polymers leads to the observation of a topological quantum phase transition. The transition is marked by the emergence of a zero&#8208;energy in&#8208;gap edge state. A pseudo Jahn&#8211;Teller effect is identified as the driving mechanism by theoretical calculations. Furthermore, atomic manipulation with scanning tunneling microscopy allows for engineering polymers.








Abstract
Quantum phase transitions (QPTs) driven by quantum fluctuations are transitions between distinct quantum phases of matter. At present, they are poorly understood and not readily controlled. Here, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and noncontact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM) are used to explore atomic scale control over quantum phase transitions between two different topological quantum states of a well&#8208;defined &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer. The phase transition is driven by a pseudo Jahn&#8211;Teller effect that is activated above a certain polymer chain length. In addition, theoretical calculations indicate the presence of long&#8208;lasting coherent fluctuations between the polymer's two quantum phases near the phase transition, at finite temperature. This work thus presents a new way of exploring atomic&#8208;scale control over QPTs and indicates that emerging quantum criticality in the vicinity of a QPT can give rise to new states of organic matter.

         <title>Multichannel Piezo&#8208;Ultrasound Implant with Hybrid Waterborne Acoustic Metastructure for Selective Wireless Energy Transfer at Megahertz Frequencies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multichannel piezo&#8208;ultrasound implant (MC&#8208;PUI) is proposed, which integrates a hybrid waterborne acoustic metastructure, multiple piezo&#8208;harvesters, and a miniaturized circuit with electronic components for selective wireless control via ultrasound frequency switching. The optimized device structure that utilizes a 3D&#8208;printed air&#8208;diffraction matrix and a half&#8208;lambda Fabry&#8211;Perot resonator provides the advantage of ultrasound frequency selectivity for in vivo multifunctional operations.








Abstract
Ultrasound energy transfer (UET) is developed and integrated into various bioelectronics with diagnostic, therapeutic, and monitoring capabilities. However, existing UET platforms generally enable one function at a time due to the single ultrasound channel architecture, limiting the full potential of bioelectronics that requires multicontrol modes. Here, a multichannel piezo&#8208;ultrasound implant (MC&#8208;PUI) is presented that integrates a hybrid waterborne acoustic metastructure (HWAM), multiple piezo&#8208;harvesters, and a miniaturized circuit with electronic components for selective wireless control via ultrasound frequency switching. The HWAM that utilizes both a 3D&#8208;printed air&#8208;diffraction matrix and a half&#8208;lambda Fabry&#8211;Perot resonator is optimized to provide the advantage of ultrasound selectivity at megahertz frequencies. Complying with U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations, frequency&#8208;controlled multifunctional operations, such as wireless charging (&#8776;11.08 &#181;W) at 3.3&#160;MHz and high&#8208;sensitivity wireless switch/control (threshold &#8776;0.55&#160;MPa) of micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diode/motor at 1&#160;MHz, are demonstrated ex vivo using porcine tissue and in vivo in a rat. The developed MC&#8208;PUI enhances UET versatility and opens up a new pathway for wireless implant design.

         <title>A Bioinspired Stretchable Sensory&#8208;Neuromorphic System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel form of stretchable integrated system, namely a bioinspired stretchable sensory&#8208;neuromorphic system, is presented, which comprises an artificial mechanoreceptor, an artificial synapse, and an epidermal photonic actuator as three devices. This system features a bioinspired sensory&#8208;neuromorphic system entailing tactile sensing, pattern learning/inferencing, and visualizing feedback information.








Abstract
Conventional stretchable electronics that adopt a wavy design, a neutral mechanical plane, and conformal contact between abiotic and biotic interfaces have exhibited diverse skin&#8208;interfaced applications. Despite such remarkable progress, the evolution of intelligent skin prosthetics is challenged by the absence of the monolithic integration of neuromorphic constituents into individual sensing and actuating components. Herein, a bioinspired stretchable sensory&#8208;neuromorphic system, comprising an artificial mechanoreceptor, artificial synapse, and epidermal photonic actuator is demonstrated; these three biomimetic functionalities correspond to a stretchable capacitive pressure sensor, a resistive random&#8208;access memory, and a quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diode, respectively. This system features a rigid&#8208;island structure interconnected with a sinter&#8208;free printable conductor, which is optimized by controlling the evaporation rate of solvent (&#8776;160% stretchability and &#8776;18&#160;550 S cm&#8722;1 conductivity). Devised design improves both areal density and structural reliability while avoiding the thermal degradation of heat&#8208;sensitive stretchable electronic components. Moreover, even in the skin deformation range, the system accurately recognizes various patterned stimuli via an artificial neural network with training/inferencing functions. Therefore, the new bioinspired system is expected to be an important step toward implementing intelligent wearable electronics.

         <title>A Cascade Battery: Coupling Two Sequential Electrochemical Reactions in a Single Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cascade battery that couples two sequential electrochemical reactions in a single battery is proposed. It can more fully utilize the inactive reaction chamber than traditional batteries and bypass the challenges of thick solid electrode to access high areal capacity. The cascade battery design breaks the stereotype of conventional battery configuration, paving a way for constructing two&#8208;in&#8208;one batteries.








Abstract
Currently, rechargeable electrochemical batteries generally operate on one reversible electrochemical reaction during discharging and charging cycles. Here, a cascade battery that couples two sequential electrochemical reactions in a single battery is proposed. Such a concept is demonstrated in an aqueous Zn&#8211;S hybrid battery, where solid sulfur serves as the cathode in the first discharge step and the generated Cu2S catalyzes Cu2+ reduce to Cu/Cu2O to provide the second discharge step. The cascade battery shows many merits compared to traditional batteries. First, it integrates two batteries internally, eliminating the use of additional inactive connecting materials required for external integration. Second, it can more fully utilize the inactive reaction chamber of the battery than traditional batteries. Third, cascade battery can bypass the challenges of thick solid electrode to access high areal capacity. An ultrahigh areal capacity of 48&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 is achieved even at a low solid cathode loading (9.6&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2). The cascade battery design breaks the stereotype of conventional battery configuration, providing a paradigm for constructing two&#8208;in&#8208;one batteries.

         <dc:description>
Monolithic fabrication of a flexible droplet&#8208;based electricity generator (DEG) is demonstrated by in situ growth of laser&#8208;induced graphene electrodes with different hydrophobicity in a fluorinated ethylene propylene&#8208;coated polyimide bilayer structure. The DEG exhibits high power conversion efficiency, lighting up 480 LEDs with one water droplet. More importantly, the DEG exhibits superior cyclability and operational stability under high humidity and various pH conditions.








Abstract
Laser&#8208;induced graphene (LIG) has emerged as a promising and versatile method for high&#8208;throughput graphene patterning; however, its full potential in creating complex structures and devices for practical applications is yet to be explored. In this study, an in&#8208;situ growing LIG process that enables to pattern superhydrophobic fluorine&#8208;doped graphene on fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP)&#8208;coated polyimide (PI) is demonstrated. This method leverages on distinct spectral responses of FEP and PI during laser excitation to generate the environment preferentially for LIG formation, eliminating the need for multistep processes and specific atmospheres. The structured and water&#8208;repellant structures rendered by the spectral&#8208;tuned interfacial LIG process are suitable as the electrode for the construction of a flexible droplet&#8208;based electricity generator (DEG), which exhibits high power conversion efficiency, generating a peak power density of 47.5 W m&#8722;2 from the impact of a water droplet 105&#160;&#181;L from a height of 25&#160;cm. Importantly, the device exhibits superior cyclability and operational stability under high humidity and various pH conditions. The facile process developed can be extended to realize various functional devices.

         <title>Engineering d&#8208;p Orbital Hybridization in Single&#8208;Atom Metal&#8208;Embedded Three&#8208;Dimensional Electrodes for Li&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A descriptor, the d&#8211;p hybridization state between single&#8208;atom metal catalysts (SACs) and sulfur species, is proposed to guide the design of SACs for Li&#8211;S batteries. The large&#8208;sized and flexible 3D electrodes with optimized SACs achieve high specific energy with low catalyst loading and high sulfur loading. The good mechanical stability for bending also shows potential for fabricating bendable/foldable Li&#8211;S batteries.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom metal catalysts (SACs) are used as sulfur cathode additives to promote battery performance, although the material selection and mechanism that govern the catalytic activity remain unclear. It is shown that d&#8208;p orbital hybridization between the single&#8208;atom metal and the sulfur species can be used as a descriptor for understanding the catalytic activity of SACs in Li&#8211;S batteries. Transition metals with a lower atomic number are found, like Ti, to have fewer filled anti&#8208;bonding states, which effectively bind lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and catalyze their electrochemical reaction. A series of single&#8208;atom metal catalysts (Me = Mn, Cu, Cr, Ti) embedded in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) electrodes are prepared by a controllable nitrogen coordination approach. Among them, the single&#8208;atom Ti&#8208;embedded electrode has the lowest electrochemical barrier to LiPSs reduction/Li2S oxidation and the highest catalytic activity, matching well with the theoretical calculations. By virtue of the highly active catalytic center of single&#8208;atom Ti on the conductive transport network, high sulfur utilization is achieved with a low catalyst loading (1&#160;wt.%) and a high area&#8208;sulfur loading (8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). With good mechanical stability for bending, these 3D electrodes are suitable for fabricating bendable/foldable Li&#8211;S batteries for wearable electronics.

&lt;p&gt;A descriptor, the &lt;i&gt;d&#8211;p&lt;/i&gt; hybridization state between single-atom metal catalysts (SACs) and sulfur species, is proposed to guide the design of SACs for Li&#8211;S batteries. The large-sized and flexible 3D electrodes with optimized SACs achieve high specific energy with low catalyst loading and high sulfur loading. The good mechanical stability for bending also shows potential for fabricating bendable/foldable Li&#8211;S batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-atom metal catalysts (SACs) are used as sulfur cathode additives to promote battery performance, although the material selection and mechanism that govern the catalytic activity remain unclear. It is shown that &lt;i&gt;d-p&lt;/i&gt; orbital hybridization between the single-atom metal and the sulfur species can be used as a descriptor for understanding the catalytic activity of SACs in Li&#8211;S batteries. Transition metals with a lower atomic number are found, like Ti, to have fewer filled anti-bonding states, which effectively bind lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and catalyze their electrochemical reaction. A series of single-atom metal catalysts (Me = Mn, Cu, Cr, Ti) embedded in three-dimensional (3D) electrodes are prepared by a controllable nitrogen coordination approach. Among them, the single-atom Ti-embedded electrode has the lowest electrochemical barrier to LiPSs reduction/Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S oxidation and the highest catalytic activity, matching well with the theoretical calculations. By virtue of the highly active catalytic center of single-atom Ti on the conductive transport network, high sulfur utilization is achieved with a low catalyst loading (1&#160;wt.%) and a high area-sulfur loading (8&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). With good mechanical stability for bending, these 3D electrodes are suitable for fabricating bendable/foldable Li&#8211;S batteries for wearable electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

By comparison of three different boron dipyrromethene compounds, the heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free 10&#8208;(anthracen&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;3,7&#8208;bis((E)&#8208;4&#8208;(diphenylamino)styryl)&#8208;5,5&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;5H&#8208;dipyrrolo[1,2&#8208;c:2&#8220;,1&#8221; f][1,3,2] diazaborinin&#8208;4&#8208;ium&#8208;5&#8208;uide is used for near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided phototherapy, in which the anthracene module is able to capture singlet oxygen with laser irradiation and release it in dark conditions for &#8220;afterglow&#8221; photodynamic therapy, leading to the complete suppression of tumors.








Abstract
Improving singlet oxygen (1O2) lifespan by fractionated delivery in dark and hypoxic conditions is a better way to achieve enhanced phototherapeutic efficacy. Herein, three boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes are synthesized to demonstrate that anthracence&#8208;functionalized BODIPY, namely ABDPTPA is an efficient heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizer for the reversible capture and release of 1O2. The spin&#8211;orbit charge&#8208;transfer intersystem crossing of ABDPTPA promises a high 1O2 quantum yield of 60% in dichloromethane. Under light irradiation, the anthracene group reacts with 1O2 to produce endoperoxide. Interestingly, after termination of irradiation, the endoperoxide undergoes thermal cycloreversion to produce 1O2, and regenerates the anthracene module to achieve 1O2 &#8220;afterglow,&#8221; which results in a prolonged half lifetime of 1O2 for 9.2&#160;min. In vitro cytotoxicity assays indicate that ABDPTPA nanoparticles have a low half&#8208;maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 3.6&#160;&#181;g mL&#8722;1 on U87MG cells. Further, the results of near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided phototherapy indicate that ABDPTPA nanoparticles can inhibit tumor proliferation even at a low dose (200&#160;&#181;g mL&#8722;1, 100&#160;&#181;L) without any side effects. Therefore, the study provides a generalized 1O2 &#8220;afterglow&#8221; strategy to enhance phototheranostics for complete tumor regression.

         <title>Molecular Ferroelectric&#8208;Based Flexible Sensors Exhibiting Supersensitivity and Multimodal Capability for Detection</title>

[C(NH2)3]ClO4&#8208;polyurethane flexible sensors feature a series of unique characteristic including self&#8208;powering, high sensitivity, and excellent durability. A comprehensive scaling analysis along with computational modeling provides insights into the electro&#8208;mechanical coupling and establishes the rules of engineering design and optimization for the molecular ferroelectric&#8208;based flexible sensors.








Abstract
Although excellent dielectric, piezoelectric, and pyroelectric properties matched with or even surpassing those of ferroelectric ceramics have been recently discovered in molecular ferroelectrics, their successful applications in devices are scarce. The fracture proneness of molecular ferroelectrics under mechanical loading precludes their applications as flexible sensors in bulk crystalline form. Here, self&#8208;powered flexible mechanical sensors prepared from the facile deposition of molecular ferroelectric [C(NH2)3]ClO4 onto a porous polyurethane (PU) matrix are reported. [C(NH2)3]ClO4&#8208;PU is capable of detecting pressure of 3&#160;Pa and strain of 1% that are hardly accessible by the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art piezoelectric, triboelectric, and piezoresistive sensors, and presents the ability of sensing multimodal mechanical forces including compression, stretching, bending, shearing, and twisting with high cyclic stability. This scaling analysis corroborated with computational modeling provides detailed insights into the electro&#8208;mechanical coupling and establishes rules of engineering design and optimization for the hybrid sponges. Demonstrative applications of the [C(NH2)3]ClO4&#8208;PU array suggest potential uses in interactive electronics and robotic systems.

         <title>Efficient Ion Sieving in Covalent Organic Framework Membranes with Sub&#8208;2&#8208;Nanometer Channels</title>

Ultrathin covalent organic framework membranes are constructed, where abundant hydrogen bonding sites are lined in the 1D sub&#8208;2&#8208;nm sized channels. The hydrogen&#8208;bond binding interaction between the hydrogen bonding sites and hydrated divalent cations are stronger than that of monovalent cations, enabling efficient metal ion sieving driven by the concentration gradient.








Abstract
Membranes of sub&#8208;2&#8208;nanometer channels show high ion transport rates, but it remains a great challenge to design such membranes with desirable ion selectivities for ion separation applications. Here, covalent organic framework (COF) membranes with a channel size of &#8776;1.4&#160;nm and abundant hydrogen bonding sites, exhibiting efficient ion sieving properties are demonstrated. The COF membranes have high monovalent cation permeation rates of 0.1&#8211;0.2&#160;mol m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 and extremely low multivalent cation permeabilities, leading to high monovalent over divalent ion selectivities for K+/Mg2+ of &#8776;765, Na+/Mg2+ of &#8776;680, and Li+/Mg2+ of &#8776;217. Experimental measurements and theoretical simulations reveal that the hydrogen bonding interaction between hydrated cations and the COF channel wall governs the high selectivity, and divalent cations transport through the channel needs to overcome higher energy barriers than monovalent cations. These findings provide an effective strategy for developing sub&#8208;2&#8208;nanometer sized membranes with specific interaction sites for high&#8208;efficiency ionic separation.

         <title>Skin&#8208;Integrated Devices with Soft, Holey Architectures for Wireless Physiological Monitoring, With Applications in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Material strategies and design concepts, including holey architectures, precurved layouts, and structured hydrogel adhesives, are introduced for thin, soft wireless devices that can continuously monitor vital signs in the neonatal and pediatric intensive care units. They enable mechanical and geometrical advantages, soft release of devices from the skin, improved permeability, and visual inspection of the skin through holes.








Abstract
Continuous monitoring of vital signs is an essential aspect of operations in neonatal and pediatric intensive care units (NICUs and PICUs), of particular importance to extremely premature and/or critically ill patients. Current approaches require multiple sensors taped to the skin and connected via hard&#8208;wired interfaces to external data acquisition electronics. The adhesives can cause iatrogenic injuries to fragile, underdeveloped skin, and the wires can complicate even the most routine tasks in patient care. Here, materials strategies and design concepts are introduced that significantly improve these platforms through the use of optimized materials, open (i.e., &#8220;holey&#8221;) layouts and precurved designs.

     alt="Skin-Integrated Devices with Soft, Holey Architectures for Wireless Physiological Monitoring, With Applications in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Material strategies and design concepts, including holey architectures, precurved layouts, and structured hydrogel adhesives, are introduced for thin, soft wireless devices that can continuously monitor vital signs in the neonatal and pediatric intensive care units. They enable mechanical and geometrical advantages, soft release of devices from the skin, improved permeability, and visual inspection of the skin through holes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuous monitoring of vital signs is an essential aspect of operations in neonatal and pediatric intensive care units (NICUs and PICUs), of particular importance to extremely premature and/or critically ill patients. Current approaches require multiple sensors taped to the skin and connected via hard-wired interfaces to external data acquisition electronics. The adhesives can cause iatrogenic injuries to fragile, underdeveloped skin, and the wires can complicate even the most routine tasks in patient care. Here, materials strategies and design concepts are introduced that significantly improve these platforms through the use of optimized materials, open (i.e., &#8220;holey&#8221;) layouts and precurved designs. These schemes 1) reduce the stresses at the skin interface, 2) facilitate release of interfacial moisture from transepidermal water loss, 3) allow visual inspection of the skin for rashes or other forms of irritation, 4) enable triggered reduction of adhesion to reduce the probability for injuries that can result from device removal. A combination of systematic benchtop testing and computational modeling identifies the essential mechanisms and key considerations. Demonstrations on adult volunteers and on a neonate in an operating NICUs illustrate a broad range of capabilities in continuous, clinical-grade monitoring of conventional vital signs, and unconventional indicators of health status.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chaotic Organic Crystal Phosphorescent Patterns for Physical Unclonable Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chaotic phosphorescent patterns are developed based on an organic crystal and MoS2 heterostructure for physical unclonable functions (PUFs). The phosphorescent patterns on the MoS2 seem similar on the macroscopic scale, whereas each organic crystal exhibits highly disorder features on the microscopic scale. In image analysis, the encoding capacity as a single PUF domain achieves more than 1017 on a MoS2 small fragment.








Abstract
Since the 4th Industrial Revolution, Internet of Things based environments have been widely used in various fields ranging from mobile to medical devices. Simultaneously, information leakage and hacking risks have also increased significantly, and secure authentication and security systems are constantly required. Physical unclonable functions (PUF) are in the spotlight as an alternative. Chaotic phosphorescent patterns are developed based on an organic crystal and atomic seed heterostructure for security labels with PUFs. Phosphorescent organic crystal patterns are formed on MoS2. They seem similar on a macroscopic scale, whereas each organic crystal exhibits highly disorder features on the microscopic scale. In image analysis, an encoding capacity as a single PUF domain achieves more than 1017 on a MoS2 small fragment with lengths of 25&#160;&#181;m. Therefore, security labels with phosphorescent PUFs can offer superior randomness and no&#8208;cloning codes, possibly becoming a promising security strategy for authentication processes.

         <title>Controllable Solution&#8208;Phase Epitaxial Growth of Q1D Sb2(S,Se)3/CdS Heterojunction Solar Cell with 9.2% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solar cell device based on (hk1)&#8208;oriented Sb2(S,Se)S3 grown on top of hexagonal CdS is successfully prepared. The enhanced device performance is attributed not only to the faster charge transport along the vertically oriented (Sb4X6)n ribbons, but also to the efficient charge extraction across the heterojunction owing to the formation of favorable covalent bond at the junction.








Abstract
Antimony sulfoselenide (Sb2(S,Se)3) is a promising photoabsorber for stable and high efficiency thin film photovoltaics (PV). The unique quasi&#8208;1D (Q1D) crystal structure gives Sb2(S,Se)3 intriguing anisotropic optoelectronic properties, which intrinsically require the optimization of crystal growth orientation, especially for electronic devices with vertical charge transport such as solar cells. Although the efficiency of Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells has been improved greatly through optimizing the material quality, the fundamental issue of crystal orientation control in polycrystalline films remains unsolved, resulting in charge carrier recombination losses in the device. Herein, the epitaxial growth of vertically&#8208;oriented Sb2(S,Se)3 film on hexagonal CdS is successfully realized via a solution&#8208;based synergistic crystal growth process. The crystallographic orientation relationship between Sb2(S,Se)3 light absorber and the CdS substrate has been rigorously investigated. The best performing Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cell shows a high power conversion efficiency of 9.2% owing to the faster charge transport in the bulk and the efficient charge extraction across the heterojunction. This study points to a new direction to control the crystal growth of mixed&#8208;anion Sb2(S,Se)3, which is crucial to achieve high efficiency solar cells based on antimony chalcogenides with low dimensionality.

         <title>Superior Sodium Storage Properties in the Anode Material NiCr2S4 for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries: An X&#8208;ray Diffraction, Pair Distribution Function, and X&#8208;ray Absorption Study Reveals a Conversion Mechanism via Nickel Extrusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Results of an extensive study of pseudo&#8208;layered NiCr2S4 as an anode material in sodium&#8208;ion batteries are reported. Electrochemical and kinetic characteristics, X&#8208;ray absorption, diffraction, and total&#8208;scattering experiments evidence a complex and unusual charge storage mechanism: nickel extrusion and sodium insertion via formation of a NaCrS2 intermediate followed by the full conversion to nanocrystalline Ni0, Cr0, and Na2S is observed.








Abstract
The pseudo&#8208;layered sulfide NiCr2S4 exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance as anode material in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). The Na storage mechanism is investigated by synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray scattering and absorption techniques as well as by electrochemical measurements. A very high reversible capacity in the 500th cycle of 489&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 is observed at 2.0&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 in the potential window 3.0&#8211;0.1&#160;V. Full discharge includes irreversible generation of Ni0 and Cr0 nanoparticles embedded in nanocrystalline Na2S yielding shortened diffusion lengths and predominantly surface&#8208;controlled charge storage. During charge, Ni0 and Cr0 are oxidized, Na2S is consumed, and amorphous Ni and Cr sulfides are formed. Limiting the potential window to 3.0&#8211;0.3&#160;V an unusual nickel extrusion sodium insertion mechanism occurs: Ni2+ is reduced to nanosized Ni0 domains, expelled from the host lattice, and is replaced by Na+ cations to form O3&#8208;type like NaCrS2. Surprisingly, the discharge and charge processes comprise Na+ shuttling between highly crystalline NiCr2S4 and NaCrS2 enabling a superior long&#8208;term stability for 3000 cycles. The results not only provide valuable insights for the electrochemistry of conversion materials but also extend the scope of layered electrode materials considering the reversible nickel extrusion sodium insertion reaction as new concept for SIBs.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Ruthenium on Nickel Hydroxide Ultrathin Nanoribbons for Highly Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media, atomically dispersed ruthenium (Ru) loaded nickel hydroxide ultrathin nanoribbons (R&#8208;NiRu) with extremely high aspect ratio of &#8776;100 and large Ru loading amount reaching up to &#8776;7.7&#160;wt% are synthesized via an efficient and facile one&#8208;step hydrothermal process. The R&#8208;NiRu demonstrate a superb HER performance in alkaline media.








Abstract
Achieving highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media is a great challenge. Single&#8208;atom catalysts with high&#8208;loading amount have attracted great interest due to their remarkable catalytic properties. Herein, by using nickel foam as the substrate, the authors design and precisely synthesize atomic ruthenium (Ru)&#8208;loaded nickel hydroxide ultrathin nanoribbons (R&#8208;NiRu) with a high atomic Ru loading amount reaching &#8776;7.7&#160;wt% via a one&#8208;step hydrothermal method. The presence of concentrated Cl&#8722; in the synthetic system is beneficial for constructing ultrathin nanoribbons, which, with abundant edge &#63743;OH groups, make it easy to trap atomic Ru. Taking advantage of the synergy between atomic Ru and the nanoribbon morphology of nickel hydroxide, R&#8208;NiRu exhibit a low overpotential of 16&#160;mV for HER at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 40&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1 in aqueous 1.0&#160;m&#160;KOH solution, which are superior to those of commercial Pt/C (overpotential of 17&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, Tafel slope of 43&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1). Density functional theory (DFT) calculation results demonstrate that atomically dispersed Ru can significantly reduce the HER energy barrier.

&lt;p&gt;To achieve highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media, atomically dispersed ruthenium (Ru) loaded nickel hydroxide ultrathin nanoribbons (R-NiRu) with extremely high aspect ratio of &#8776;100 and large Ru loading amount reaching up to &#8776;7.7&#160;wt% are synthesized via an efficient and facile one-step hydrothermal process. The R-NiRu demonstrate a superb HER performance in alkaline media.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media is a great challenge. Single-atom catalysts with high-loading amount have attracted great interest due to their remarkable catalytic properties. Herein, by using nickel foam as the substrate, the authors design and precisely synthesize atomic ruthenium (Ru)-loaded nickel hydroxide ultrathin nanoribbons (R-NiRu) with a high atomic Ru loading amount reaching &#8776;7.7&#160;wt% via a one-step hydrothermal method. The presence of concentrated Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in the synthetic system is beneficial for constructing ultrathin nanoribbons, which, with abundant edge &lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;OH groups, make it easy to trap atomic Ru. Taking advantage of the synergy between atomic Ru and the nanoribbon morphology of nickel hydroxide, R-NiRu exhibit a low overpotential of 16&#160;mV for HER at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a Tafel slope of 40&#160;mV&#160;dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in aqueous 1.0&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&#160;&lt;/span&gt;KOH solution, which are superior to those of commercial Pt/C (overpotential of 17&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, Tafel slope of 43&#160;mV&#160;dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

         <title>Molecular Dopant&#8208;Dependent Charge Transport in Surface&#8208;Charge&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Doped Tungsten Diselenide Field Effect Transistors</title>

         <dc:description>
Using three p&#8208;type molecular dopants with different electron affinities, charge transfer processes and the scattering effects induced by dopant molecules are directly related for understanding charge transport in a molecular&#8208;doped tungsten diselenide channel. This systematic investigation of the charge transport of doped transition metal dichalcogenides(TMDCs) reveals intrinsic molecular properties that can achieve efficient and controllable molecular doping in TMDCs.








Abstract
The controllability of carrier density and major carrier type of transition metal dichalcogenides(TMDCs) is critical for electronic and optoelectronic device applications. To utilize doping in TMDC devices, it is important to understand the role of dopants in charge transport properties of TMDCs. Here, the effects of molecular doping on the charge transport properties of tungsten diselenide (WSe2) are investigated using three p&#8208;type molecular dopants, 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4&#8208;TCNQ), tris(4&#8208;bromophenyl)ammoniumyl hexachloroantimonate (magic blue), and molybdenum tris(1,2&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;dithiolene) (Mo(tfd&#8208;COCF3)3). The temperature&#8208;dependent transport measurements show that the dopant counterions on WSe2 surface can induce Coulomb scattering in WSe2 channel and the degree of scattering is significantly dependent on the dopant. Furthermore, the quantitative analysis revealed that the amount of charge transfer between WSe2 and dopants is related to not only doping density, but also the contribution of each dopant ion toward Coulomb scattering. The first&#8208;principles density functional theory calculations show that the amount of charge transfer is mainly determined by intrinsic properties of the dopant molecules such as relative frontier orbital positions and their spin configurations. The authors&#8217; systematic investigation of the charge transport of doped TMDCs will be directly relevant for pursuing molecular routes for efficient and controllable doping in TMDC nanoelectronic devices.

Air&#8208;stable large&#8208;area 2D&#8208;InxGa1&#8722;x alloys with tunable composition and no evidence of phase segregation are realized by confinement heteroepitaxy. The optical and electronic properties directly correlate with alloy composition, wherein the dielectric function, band structure, superconductivity, and charge transfer from the metal to graphene are all controlled by the indium/gallium ratio in the 2D metal layer.








Abstract
Chemically stable quantum&#8208;confined 2D metals are of interest in next&#8208;generation nanoscale quantum devices. Bottom&#8208;up design and synthesis of such metals could enable the creation of materials with tailored, on&#8208;demand, electronic and optical properties for applications that utilize tunable plasmonic coupling, optical nonlinearity, epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero behavior, or wavelength&#8208;specific light trapping. In this work, it is demonstrated that the electronic, superconducting, and optical properties of air&#8208;stable 2D metals can be controllably tuned by the formation of alloys. Environmentally robust large&#8208;area 2D&#8208;InxGa1&#8722;x alloys are synthesized byConfinement Heteroepitaxy (CHet). Near&#8208;complete solid solubility is achieved with no evidence of phase segregation, and the composition is tunable over the full range of x by changing the relative elemental composition of the precursor. The optical and electronic properties directly correlate with alloy composition, wherein the dielectric function, band structure, superconductivity, and charge transfer from the metal to graphene are all controlled by the indium/gallium ratio in the 2D metal layer.

         <title>Crack Suppression in Conductive Film by Amyloid&#8208;Like Protein Aggregation toward Flexible Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid amyloid&#8208;like protein nanofilm with high mechanical strength and robust interfacial adhesion shows high interfacial activity to induce electroless deposition of metal on a flexible substrate, and significantly diminishes the development of microcracks after repetitive bending or stretching of metal&#8208;coated polymer substrates. This work demonstrates the significant contribution of amyloid&#8208;like protein aggregation in the fabrication of flexible conductive devices.








Abstract
A fatal weakness in flexible electronics is the mechanical fracture that occurs during repetitive fatigue deformation; thus, controlling the crack development of the conductive layer is of prime importance and has remained a great challenge until now. Herein, this issue is tackled by utilizing an amyloid/polysaccharide molecular composite as an interfacial binder. Sodium alginate (SA) can take part in amyloid&#8208;like aggregation of the lysozyme, leading to the facile synthesis of a 2D protein/saccharide hybrid nanofilm over an ultralarge area (e.g., &gt;400&#160;cm2). The introduction of SA into amyloid&#8208;like aggregates significantly enhances the mechanical strength of the hybrid nanofilm, which, with the help of amyloid&#8208;mediated interfacial adhesion, effectively diminishes the microcracks in the hybrid nanofilm coating after repetitive bending or stretching. The microcrack&#8208;free hybrid nanofilm then shows high interfacial activity to induce electroless deposition of metal in a Kelvin model on a substrate, which noticeably suppresses the formation of microcracks and consequent conductivity loss during the bending and stretching of the metal&#8208;coated flexible substrates. This work underlines the significance of amyloid/polysaccharide nanocomposites in the design of interfacial binders for reliable flexible electronic devices and represents an important contribution to mimicking amyloid and polysaccharide&#8208;based adhesive cements created by organisms.

Synergistic electrical and optical multimodal sensing by 3D nanoarchitectures for label&#8208;free gas detection is reported.








Abstract
Practical sensing applications such as real&#8208;time safety alerts and clinical diagnoses require sensor devices to differentiate between various target molecules with high sensitivity and selectivity, yet conventional devices such as oxide&#8208;based chemo&#8208;resistive sensors and metal&#8208;based surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) sensors usually do not satisfy such requirements. Here, a label&#8208;free, chemo&#8208;resistive/SERS multimodal sensor based on a systematically assembled 3D cross&#8208;point multifunctional nanoarchitecture (3D&#8208;CMA), which has unusually strong enhancements in both &#8220;chemo&#8208;resistive&#8221; and &#8220;SERS&#8221; sensing characteristics is introduced. 3D&#8208;CMA combines several sensing mechanisms and sensing elements via 3D integration of semiconducting SnO2 nanowire frameworks and dual&#8208;functioning Au metallic nanoparticles. It is shown that the multimodal sensor can successfully estimate mixed&#8208;gas compositions selectively and quantitatively at the sub&#8208;100 ppm level, even for mixtures of gaseous aromatic compounds (nitrobenzene and toluene) with very similar molecular structures. This is enabled by combined chemo&#8208;resistive and SERS multimodal sensing providing complementary information.

         <title>Superior Flexibility in Oxide Ceramic Crystal Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible ceramic nanofibers are fabricated using a ball&#8208;milling&#8208; and curved&#8208;drafting&#8208;assisted electrospinning technique. With this strategy, continuous TiO2 nanofibers, in which orderly assembled TiO2 nanocrystals are connected by twin or amorphous grain boundaries, are formed after sintering. The single nanofiber is knottable, while the nanofiber membrane can be folded without fracture, displaying properties associated with both soft and hard matter.








Abstract
Oxide crystal ceramics are commonly hard and brittle, when they are bent they typically fracture. Such mechanical response limits the use of these materials in emerging fields like wearable electronics. Here, a polymer&#8208;induced assembly strategy is reported to construct orderly assembled TiO2 crystals into continuous nanofibers that are stretchable, bendable, and even knottable. Ball&#8208;milling the spinning sol and curved&#8208;drafting the electrospun nanofibers significantly improve the molecular structural order and reduce pore defects in the precursor nanofibers. Using this method, continuous TiO2 nanofibers, in which orderly assembled TiO2 nanocrystals (brick) are connected by twin grain boundaries or an amorphous region (mortar), are formed after sintering. Mechanical measurements and finite element analysis simulation indicate that the dislocation slip of &#8220;bricks&#8221; and the elastic deformation of &#8220;mortar&#8221; render the nanofibers with a small bending rigidity of &#8776;22 mN and a small elastic modulus of &#8776;20.8 Gpa, thus displaying properties associated with both soft and hard matter. More importantly, the reported approach can be easily extended to synthesize a wide range of soft, yet tough ceramic membranes, such as ZrO2 and SiO2.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Circular&#8208;Economy Recycling for Proteins: Proof of Concept</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixtures of peptides and high&#8208;tech proteins (silk fibroins, &#946;&#8208;lactoglobulin films) are depolymerized into their amino acid components. Such amino acids are used as the only source of monomers for polymerizing biotechnologically relevant proteins (fluorescent proteins, catechol 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase), outside living organisms. The process is repeated multiple times showing that sequence&#8208;defined polymers can be recycled by fulfilling the principles of circular economy.








Abstract
The billion tons of synthetic&#8208;polymer&#8208;based materials (i.e. plastics) produced yearly are a great challenge for humanity. Nature produces even more natural polymers, yet they are sustainable. Proteins are sequence&#8208;defined natural polymers that are constantly recycled when living systems feed. Digestion is the protein depolymerization into amino acids (the monomers) followed by their re&#8208;assembly into new proteins of arbitrarily different sequence and function. This breaks a common recycling paradigm where a material is recycled into itself. Organisms feed off of random protein mixtures that are &#8220;recycled&#8221; into new proteins whose identity depends on the cell's specific needs. In this study, mixtures of several peptides and/or proteins are depolymerized into their amino acid constituents, and these amino acids are used to synthesize new fluorescent, and bioactive proteins extracellularly by using an amino&#8208;acid&#8208;free, cell&#8208;free transcription&#8211;translation (TX&#8211;TL) system. Specifically, three peptides (magainin II, glucagon, and somatostatin 28) are digested using thermolysin first and then using leucine aminopeptidase. The amino acids so produced are added to a commercial TX&#8211;TL system to produce fluorescent proteins. Furthermore, proteins with high relevance in materials engineering (&#946;&#8208;lactoglobulin films, used for water filtration, or silk fibroin solutions) are successfully recycled into biotechnologically relevant proteins (fluorescent proteins, catechol 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase).

         <title>Approaching Nearly 40% External Quantum Efficiency in Organic Light Emitting Diodes Utilizing a Green Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter with an Extended Linear Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8211;Donor Structure</title>

         <dc:description>
A green thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitter with an extended &#960;&#8208;system of linear donor (D)&#8211;acceptor (A)&#8211;donor (D) structure is established to simultaneously obtain a horizontal emitting dipole orientation ratio of 92%, a reverse intersystem crossing rate of 1.16 &#215; 106 s&#8211;1 and a photoluminescence quantum yield of 95%, together affording a champion maximum external quantum efficiency of 39.1%.








Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters featuring preferential horizontal emitting dipole orientation (EDO) are in urgent demand for enhanced optical outcoupling efficiency in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, simultaneously manipulating EDO and optoelectronic properties remains a formidable challenge. Here, an extended linear D&#8211;A&#8211;D structure with both enlarged donor (D) and acceptor (A) &#960;&#8208;systems is established, not only elaborately manipulating parallel horizontal molecular orientation and EDO along its long axis by multi&#8208;driving&#8208;forces for a high horizontal dipole ratio (&#920;//), but also delocalizing distribution of frontier energy levels for optimized electronic properties. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;concept emitter simultaneously affords a high &#920;// of 92%, a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 95%, and a fast reverse intersystem crossing rate of 1.16 &#215; 106 s&#8208;1. The corresponding OLED achieves a champion maximum external quantum efficiency of 39.1% among all green TADF devices without any external light&#8208;extraction techniques, together with a maximum power efficiency of 112.0&#160;lm W&#8208;1 and alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;off. These findings may inspire even better full&#8208;color TADF emitters that push the device efficiency toward the theoretical limits.

         <title>Novel Ultrabright and Air&#8208;Stable Photocathodes Discovered from Machine Learning and Density Functional Theory Driven Screening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 44, November 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over 74 000 semiconducting materials are computationally screened to identify promising ultrahigh&#8208;brightness photocathode materials for use in next&#8208;generation free&#8208;electron lasers. This broad search results in the identification of novel materials that are predicted to be considerably brighter and more resistant to oxidation than the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocathode materials.








Abstract
The high brightness, low emittance electron beams achieved in modern X&#8208;ray free&#8208;electron lasers (XFELs) have enabled powerful X&#8208;ray imaging tools, allowing molecular systems to be imaged at picosecond time scales and sub&#8208;nanometer length scales. One of the most promising directions for increasing the brightness of XFELs is through the development of novel photocathode materials. Whereas past efforts aimed at discovering photocathode materials have typically employed trial&#8208;and&#8208;error&#8208;based iterative approaches, this work represents the first data&#8208;driven screening for high brightness photocathode materials. Through screening over 74 000 semiconducting materials, a vast photocathode dataset is generated, resulting in statistically meaningful insights into the nature of high brightness photocathode materials. This screening results in a diverse list of photocathode materials that exhibit intrinsic emittances that are up to 4x lower than currently used photocathodes. In a second effort, multiobjective screening is employed to identify the family of M2O (M = Na, K, Rb) that exhibits photoemission properties that are comparable to the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocathode materials, but with superior air stability. This family represents perhaps the first intrinsically bright, visible light photocathode materials that are resistant to reactions with oxygen, allowing for their transport and storage in dry air environments.

     alt="Novel Ultrabright and Air-Stable Photocathodes Discovered from Machine Learning and Density Functional Theory Driven Screening"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 74 000 semiconducting materials are computationally screened to identify promising ultrahigh-brightness photocathode materials for use in next-generation free-electron lasers. This broad search results in the identification of novel materials that are predicted to be considerably brighter and more resistant to oxidation than the current state-of-the-art photocathode materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high brightness, low emittance electron beams achieved in modern X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) have enabled powerful X-ray imaging tools, allowing molecular systems to be imaged at picosecond time scales and sub-nanometer length scales. One of the most promising directions for increasing the brightness of XFELs is through the development of novel photocathode materials. Whereas past efforts aimed at discovering photocathode materials have typically employed trial-and-error-based iterative approaches, this work represents the first data-driven screening for high brightness photocathode materials. Through screening over 74 000 semiconducting materials, a vast photocathode dataset is generated, resulting in statistically meaningful insights into the nature of high brightness photocathode materials. This screening results in a diverse list of photocathode materials that exhibit intrinsic emittances that are up to 4x lower than currently used photocathodes. In a second effort, multiobjective screening is employed to identify the family of M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (M = Na, K, Rb) that exhibits photoemission properties that are comparable to the current state-of-the-art photocathode materials, but with superior air stability. This family represents perhaps the first intrinsically bright, visible light photocathode materials that are resistant to reactions with oxygen, allowing for their transport and storage in dry air environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Gas Sensors
In article number 2105199, Yeon Sik Jung and co&#8208;workers achieve highly selective, quantitative, and multiplex detection of mixed trace level aromatic compound gases through synergistically integrated multimodal sensing. The design of the 3D cross&#8208;point multifunctional nanoarchitecture (3D&#8208;CMA) significantly enhances both chemoresistive sensing and surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy simultaneously. 3D&#8208;CMA multimodal sensors accurately identify the composition and concentrations of mixed gases with very similar molecular structures.

Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries
A descriptor, the d&#8211;p hybridization state between singleatom metal catalysts (SACs) and sulfur species, to guide the design of SACs for Li&#8211;S batteries, is proposed by Shiyong Zhao, Qianfan Zhang, Guangmin Zhou, Hui&#8208;Ming Cheng, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2105947. The large&#8208;sized and flexible 3D electrodes with optimized SACs achieve high specific energy with low catalyst loading and high sulfur loading. The good mechanical stability for bending also shows potential for fabricating bendable/foldable Li&#8211;S batteries.

Security Labeling
In article 2102542, Dong Hyuk Park, Wook Park, Sunkook Kim, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate chaotic phosphorescent patterns based on an organic crystal and MoS2 heterostructure for physical unclonable functions (PUFs). Phosphorescent&#8208;pattern&#8208;based PUFs achieve superior microscale randomness and no&#8208;cloning code with ease of fabrication. In image analysis, an encoding capacity as a single PUF domain of more than 1017 is achieved on a 25 &#956;m&#8208;cubic MoS2 sample.

Photocathode Materials
The discovery of high&#8208;brightness photocathode materials can considerably expand the capabilities of X&#8208;ray free&#8208;electron laser facilities. In article number 2104081, Evan R. Antoniuk, Evan J. Reed, and co&#8208;workers perform a comprehensive screening of over 74 000 materials to identify novel photocathode candidates. The newly discovered materials are demonstrated to achieve higher brightness and superior air stability than the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art.

Quantum Phase Transitions
As reported by Pavel Jelinek and co&#8208;workers in article number 2104495, length control of &#960;&#8208;conjugated pentacene polymers leads to the observation of a topological quantum phase transition. The transition is marked by the emergence of a zero&#8208;energy in&#8208;gap edge state and a pseudo Jahn&#8211;Teller effect is identified as the driving mechanism.

Abstract
Hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) has emerged as a strong candidate for two&#8208;dimensional (2D) material owing to its exciting optoelectrical properties combined with mechanical robustness, thermal stability, and chemical inertness. Super&#8208;thin h&#8208;BN layers have gained significant attention from the scientific community for many applications, including nanoelectronics, photonics, biomedical, anti&#8208;corrosion, and catalysis, among others. This review provides a systematic elaboration of the structural, electrical, mechanical, optical, and thermal properties of h&#8208;BN followed by a comprehensive account of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthesis strategies for 2D h&#8208;BN, including chemical exfoliation, chemical, and physical vapor deposition, and other methods that have been successfully developed in recent years. It further elaborates a wide variety of processing routes developed for doping, substitution, functionalization, and combination with other materials to form heterostructures. Based on the extraordinary properties and thermal&#8208;mechanical&#8208;chemical stability of 2D&#160;h&#8208;BN, various potential applications of these structures are described.

         <dc:description>
Underwater adhesives are in high demand from medical to ocean technology. Key specific challenges are discussed to achieve underwater adhesion, and then an overview of strategies of the existing research and the performances of underwater adhesives achieved is presented. Finally, the possible solutions for the challenges, along with future research directions are discussed.








Abstract
Underwater adhesives are in high demand in both commercial and industrial sectors. Compared with adhesives used in dry (air) environments, adhesives used for wet or submerged surfaces in aqueous environments have specific challenges in development and performance. In this review, focus is on adhesives demonstrating macroscopic adhesion to wet/underwater substrates. The current strategies are first introduced for different types of underwater adhesives, and then an overview is provided of the development and performance of underwater adhesives based on different mechanisms and strategies. Finally, the possible research directions and prospects of underwater adhesives are discussed.

         <title>Tailoring Competitive Adsorption Sites by Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy on Cobalt Oxides to Enhance the Electrooxidation of Biomass</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrooxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMFOR) process is complicated, including the HMF and OH&#8722; jointly adsorbed and coupled with each other. In this work, the role of oxygen vacancies is investigated during HMFOR. It is found that the OH&#8722; tends to fill into Vo and participate in the dehydrogenation of HMF molecules, which can improve the catalytic activity of HMFOR.








Abstract
The electrooxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) offers a promising green route to attain high&#8208;value chemicals from biomass. The HMF electrooxidation reaction (HMFOR) is a complicated process involving the combined adsorption and coupling of organic molecules and OH&#8722; on the electrode surface. An in&#8208;depth understanding of these adsorption sites and reaction processes on electrocatalysts is fundamentally important. Herein, the adsorption behavior of HMF and OH&#8722;, and the role of oxygen vacancy on Co3O4 are initially unraveled. Correspondingly, instead of the competitive adsorption of OH&#8722; and HMF on the metal sites, it is observed that the OH&#8722; can fill into oxygen vacancy (Vo) prior to couple with organic molecules through lattice oxygen oxidation reaction process, which could accelerate the rate&#8208;determining step of the dehydrogenation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA) intermediates. With the modulated adsorption sites, the as&#8208;designed Vo&#8208;Co3O4 shows excellent activity for HMFOR with the earlier potential of 90 and 120&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 1 m KOH and 1 m PBS solution. This work sheds insight on the catalytic mechanism of oxygen vacancy, which benefits designing a novel electrocatalysts to modulate the multi&#8208;molecules combined adsorption behaviors.

         <title>A Schottky&#8208;Barrier&#8208;Free Plasmonic Semiconductor Photocatalyst for Nitrogen Fixation in a &#8220;One&#8208;Stone&#8208;Two&#8208;Birds&#8221; Manner</title>

         <dc:description>
A Schottky&#8208;barrier&#8208;free plasmonic photocatalyst is designed out of oxygen&#8208;deficient semiconductor MoO3 spheres for efficient nitrogen photofixation. The abundant oxygen vacancies in the spheres &#8220;kill two birds with one stone.&#8221; They serve as active sites for nitrogen molecules and induce localized surface plasmon resonance simultaneously. Apparent quantum efficiencies of over 1% are recorded from 700&#160;nm up to 1064&#160;nm.








Abstract
Plasmonic photocatalysis has received much attention owing to attractive plasmonic enhancement effects in improving the solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency. However, the photocatalytic efficiencies have remained low mainly due to the short carrier lifetime caused by the rapid recombination of plasmon&#8208;generated hot charge carriers. Although plasmonic metal&#8211;semiconductor heterostructures can improve the separation of hot charge carriers, a large portion of the hot charge carriers are lost when they cross the Schottky barrier. Herein, a Schottky&#8208;barrier&#8208;free plasmonic semiconductor photocatalyst, MoO3&#8722;x, which allows for efficient N2 photofixation in a &#8220;one&#8208;stone&#8208;two&#8208;birds&#8221; manner, is demonstrated. The oxygen vacancies in MoO3&#8722;x serve as the &#8220;stone.&#8221; They &#8220;kill two birds&#8221; by functioning as the active sites for the chemisorption of N2 molecules and inducing localized surface plasmon resonance for the generation of hot charge carriers. Benefiting from this unique strategy, plasmonic MoO3&#8722;x exhibits a remarkable photoreactivity for NH3 production up to the wavelength of 1064&#160;nm with apparent quantum efficiencies over 1%, and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion efficiency of 0.057% without any hole scavenger. This work shows the great potential of plasmonic semiconductors to be directly used for photocatalysis. The concept of the Schottky&#8208;barrier&#8208;free design will pave a new path for the rational design of efficient photocatalysts.

         <title>4D Printing of Liquid Crystals: What's Right for Me?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystals are the basis for many &#8220;smart&#8221; materials used in, for instance, soft robotics and polymer optics. Recently, their potential and appeal for different additive manufacturing techniques has been demonstrated. Insight into the usage of liquid crystals in 3D printing for fabrication at both micro&#8208; and centimeterscale is provided for those wanting to join this exciting, developing field.








Abstract
Recent years have seen major advances in the developments of both additive manufacturing concepts and responsive materials. When combined as 4D printing, the process can lead to functional materials and devices for use in health, energy generation, sensing, and soft robots. Among responsive materials, liquid crystals, which can deliver programmed, reversible, rapid responses in both air and underwater, are a prime contender for additive manufacturing, given their ease of use and adaptability to many different applications. In this paper, selected works are compared and analyzed to come to a didactical overview of the liquid crystal&#8208;additive manufacturing junction. Reading from front to back gives the reader a comprehensive understanding of the options and challenges in the field, while researchers already experienced in either liquid crystals or additive manufacturing are encouraged to scan through the text to see how they can incorporate additive manufacturing or liquid crystals into their own work. The educational text is closed with proposals for future research in this crossover field.

         <title>Tin Halide Perovskites: From Fundamental Properties to Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thorough overview is given on the fundamental properties of tin halide perovskites tailored to their application in solar cells. A detailed discussion of the crystal structure, electronic properties, photophysics, and thin&#8208;film crystallization of tin halide perovskites provides a foundation to highlight its exceptional properties and reveals research strategies to improve the performance of tin halide solar cells.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites have unique optical and electrical properties, which make them an excellent class of materials for a broad spectrum of optoelectronic applications. However, it is with photovoltaic devices that this class of materials has reached the apotheosis of popularity. High power conversion efficiencies are achieved with lead&#8208;based compounds, which are toxic to the environment. Tin&#8208;based perovskites are the most promising alternative because of their bandgap close to the optimal value for photovoltaic applications, the strong optical absorption, and good charge carrier mobilities. Nevertheless, the low defect tolerance, the fast crystallization, and the oxidative instability of tin halide perovskites currently limit their efficiency. The aim of this review is to give a detailed overview of the crystallographic, photophysical, and optoelectronic properties of tin&#8208;based perovskite compounds in their multiple forms from 3D to low&#8208;dimensional structures. At the end, recent progress in tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells are reviewed, mainly focusing on the detail of the strategies adopted to improve the device performances. For each subtopic, the current challenges and the outlook are discussed, with the aim to stimulate the community to address the most important issues in a concerted manner.

         <title>Chirality Bias Tissue Homeostasis by Manipulating Immunological Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is shown that pathology&#8208;mimetic M&#8208;nanofibrils&#8212;but not physiology&#8208;mimetic P&#8208;nanofibrils&#8212;act as a defense mechanism that upregulates M2 macrophage polarization and activates downstream immune signaling to restore tissue homeostasis. These findings provide a more practical, simple, and efficient material strategy for regulating macrophages to treat disease.








Abstract
The physiological chirality of extracellular environments is substantially affected by pathological diseases. However, how this stereochemical variation drives host immunity remains poorly understood. Here, it is reported that pathology&#8208;mimetic M&#8208;nanofibrils&#8212;but not physiology&#8208;mimetic P&#8208;nanofibrils&#8212;act as a defense mechanism that helps to restore tissue homeostasis by manipulating immunological response. Quantitative multi&#8208;omics in vivo and in vitro shows that M&#8208;nanofibrils significantly inhibit inflammation and promote tissue regeneration by upregulating M2 macrophage polarization and downstream immune signaling compared with P&#8208;nanofibrils. Molecular analysis and theoretical simulation demonstrate that M&#8208;chirality displays higher stereo&#8208;affinity to cellular binding, which induces higher cellular contractile stress and activates mechanosensitive ion channel PIEZOl to conduct Ca2+ influx. In turn, the nuclear transfer of STAT is biased by Ca2+ influx to promote M2 polarization. These findings underscore the structural mechanisms of disease, providing design basis for immunotherapy with bionic functional materials.

         <title>New Dimension in Magnetism and Superconductivity: 3D and Curvilinear Nanoarchitectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rapidly developing field of curvilinear magnetism and superconductivity is reviewed. The covered topics range from novel physical concepts for material science through first proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept device demonstrations to established technologies of flexible magnetoelectronics. The review is relevant for a broad community of physicists, material scientists, and engineers, targeting fundamental research and technology transfer activities.








Abstract
Traditionally, the primary field, where curvature has been at the heart of research, is the theory of general relativity. In recent studies, however, the impact of curvilinear geometry enters various disciplines, ranging from solid&#8208;state physics over soft&#8208;matter physics, chemistry, and biology to mathematics, giving rise to a plethora of emerging domains such as curvilinear nematics, curvilinear studies of cell biology, curvilinear semiconductors, superfluidity, optics, 2D van der Waals materials, plasmonics, magnetism, and superconductivity. Here, the state of the art is summarized and prospects for future research in curvilinear solid&#8208;state systems exhibiting such fundamental cooperative phenomena as ferromagnetism, antiferromagnetism, and superconductivity are outlined. Highlighting the recent developments and current challenges in theory, fabrication, and characterization of curvilinear micro&#8208; and nanostructures, special attention is paid to perspective research directions entailing new physics and to their strong application potential. Overall, the perspective is aimed at crossing the boundaries between the magnetism and superconductivity communities and drawing attention to the conceptual aspects of how extension of structures into the third dimension and curvilinear geometry can modify existing and aid launching novel functionalities. In addition, the perspective should stimulate the development and dissemination of research and development oriented techniques to facilitate rapid transitions from laboratory demonstrations to industry&#8208;ready prototypes and eventual products.

         <title>Over 21% Efficiency Stable 2D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pure formamidinum (FA)&#8208;based 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs) achieve a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.07% (certified over 20%), the highest efficiency for low&#8208;dimensional PSCs (n&#160;&#8804; 10) reported to date, together with the improved device stability. The high&#8208;efficiency device exhibits a narrowed bandgap and unique 2D&#8211;3D intermixing phase distribution for improved light absorption and superior charge transport.








Abstract
Owing to their insufficient light absorption and charge transport, 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskites show relatively low efficiency. In this work, methylammonium (MA), formamidinum (FA), and FA/MA mixed 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are fabricated. Incorporating FA cations extends the absorption range and enhances the light absorption. Optical spectroscopy shows that FA cations substantially increase the portion of 3D&#8208;like phase to 2D phases, and X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) studies reveal that FA&#8208;based 2D perovskite possesses an oblique crystal orientation. Nevertheless, the ultrafast interphase charge transfer results in an extremely long carrier&#8208;diffusion length (&#8776;1.98&#160;&#181;m). Also, chloride additives effectively suppress the yellow &#948;&#8208;phase formation of pure FA&#8208;based 2D PSCs. As a result, both FA/MA mixed and pure FA&#8208;based 2D PSCs exhibit a greatly enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 20%. Specifically, the pure FA&#8208;based 2D PSCs achieve a record PCE of 21.07% (certified at 20%), which is the highest efficiency for low&#8208;dimensional PSCs (n&#160;&#8804; 10) reported to date. Importantly, the FA&#8208;based 2D PSCs retain 97% of their initial efficiency at 85&#160;&#176;C persistent heating after 1500&#160;h. The results unambiguously demonstrate that pure&#8208;FA&#8208;based 2D PSCs are promising for achieving comparable efficiency to 3D perovskites, along with a better device stability.

         <title>Cycloruthenated Self&#8208;Assembly with Metabolic Inhibition to Efficiently Overcome Multidrug Resistance in Cancers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cyclometalated Ru(II) complex, RuZ, is reported to be able to self&#8208;assemble and accumulate in high levels in multi&#8208;drug resistant cancer cells. RuZ significantly increases cancer cell death by dual metabolic inhibition and interactions with multiple biological targets. Overall, the results suggest that RuZ could represent a potential treatment for cancers including multi&#8208;drug resistant cancers.








Abstract
The synthesis and the evaluation of the efficacy of a cycloruthenated complex, RuZ, is reported, to overcome multi&#8208;drug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells. RuZ can self&#8208;assemble into nanoaggregates in the cell culture medium, resulting in a high intracellular concentration of RuZ in MDR cancer cells. The self&#8208;assembly significantly decreases oxygen consumption and inhibits glycolysis, which decreases cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels. The decrease in ATP levels and its low affinity for the ABCB1 and ABCG2 transporters (which mediate MDR) significantly increase the retention of RuZ by MDR cancer cells. Furthermore, RuZ increases cellular oxidative stress, inducing DNA damage, and, in combination with the aforementioned effects of RuZ, increases the apoptosis of cancer cells. Proteomic profiling analysis suggests that the RuZ primarily decreases the expression of proteins that mediate glycolysis and aerobic mitochondrial respiration and increases the expression of proteins involved in apoptosis. RuZ inhibits the proliferation of 35 cancer cell lines, of which 7 cell lines are resistant to clinical drugs. It is also active in doxorubicin&#8208;resistant MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231/Adr mouse tumor xenografts. To the best of our&#160;knowledge, the results are the first to show that self&#8208;assembled cycloruthenated complexes are efficacious in inhibiting the growth of MDR cancer cells.

         <title>Advanced Multifunctional Aqueous Rechargeable Batteries Design: From Materials and Devices to Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional aqueous rechargeable batteries (MARBs) can provide additional functions to realize unprecedented applications where conventional batteries normally fail. This review describes the recent advances of MARBs in terms of materials engineering, device design, system integration, and applications. The challenges and opportunities for further developments in the emerging field of MARBs are deeply discussed.








Abstract
Multifunctional aqueous rechargeable batteries (MARBs) are regarded as safe, cost&#8208;effective, and scalable electrochemical energy storage devices, which offer additional functionalities that conventional batteries cannot achieve, which ideally leads to unprecedented applications. Although MARBs are among the most exciting and rapidly growing topics in scientific research and industrial development nowadays, a systematic summary of the evolution and advances in the field of MARBs is still not available. Therefore, the review presented comprehensively and systematically summarizes the design principles and the recent advances of MARBs by categories of smart ARBs and integrated systems, together with an analysis of their device design and configuration, electrochemical performance, and diverse smart functions. The two most promising strategies to construct novel MARBs may be A) the introduction of functional materials into ARB components, and B) integration of ARBs with other functional devices. The ongoing challenges and future perspectives in this research and development field are outlined to foster the future development of MARBs. Finally, the most important upcoming research directions in this rapidly developing field are highlighted that may be most promising to lead to the commercialization of MARBs and to a further broadening of their range of applications.

Circularly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;TADF) and multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) properties are integrated into a new advanced material, a CPMR&#8208;TADF material. OLEDs based on these CPMR&#8208;TADF emitters show excellent performance, attaining a three&#8208;in&#8208;one advantage: high efficiency, color purity, and circular polarized light simultaneously.








Abstract
Circularly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;TADF) and multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF), which exhibit novel circularly polarized luminescence and excellent color fidelity, respectively, have gained immense popularity. In this study, integrated CP&#8208;TADF and MR&#8208;TADF (CPMR&#8208;TADF) are prepared by strategic design and synthesis of asymmetrical peripherally locked enantiomers, which are separated and denoted as (P,P&#8243;,P&#8243;)&#8208;/(M,M&#8243;,M&#8243;)&#8208;BN4 and (P,P&#8243;,P&#8243;)&#8208;/(M,M&#8243;,M&#8243;)&#8208;BN5 and exhibit TADF and circularly polarized light (CPL) properties. As the entire molecular frame participates in the frontier molecular orbitals, the resulting helical chirality of (+)/(&#8722;)&#8208;BN4&#8208; and (+)/(&#8722;)&#8208;BN5&#8208;based solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) helps in achieving a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 49/49 and 48/48&#160;nm and a high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 20.6%/19.0% and 22.0%/26.5%, respectively. Importantly, unambiguous circularly polarized electroluminescence signals with dissymmetry factors (gEL) of +3.7 &#215; 10&#8722;3/&#8722;3.1 &#215; 10&#8722;3 (BN4) and +1.9 &#215; 10&#8722;3/&#8722;1.6 &#215; 10&#8722;3 (BN5) are obtained. The results indicate successful exploitation of CPMR&#8208;TADF&#8208;emitter&#8208;based OLEDs to exhibit three characteristics: high efficiency, color purity, and circularly polarized light.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional sensor with high performance is fabricated from the hydrogen bond cross&#8208;linked network based on carboxylic styrene butadiene rubber (XSBR) and sericin&#8208;modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The sensor is a good fit for the basic requirements of full&#8208;human motion detection and real&#8208;time temperature variation monitoring, providing a promising route to develop wearable artificial intelligence in human activity and health.








Abstract
Recently, flexible wearable electronic devices have attracted immense interest as an alternative for conventional rigid metallic conductors in personal healthcare monitoring, human motion detection, and sensory skins, owing to their intrinsic characteristics. However, the practical applications of most wearable sensors are generally limited by their poor stretchability and sensitivity, unsatisfactory strength, lower conductivity, and single sensory function. Here a hydrogen bond cross&#8208;linked network based on carboxylic styrene butadiene rubber (XSBR) and hydrophilic sericin (SS) non&#8208;covalently modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is rationally designed and then fabricated into multi&#8208;functional sensors. The resultant versatile sensors are able to detect both weak and large deformations, which owns a low detection limit of 1% strain, high stretchability up to 217%, superior strength of 12.58 MPa, high sensitivity with a gauge factor up to 25.98, high conductivity of 0.071 S m&#8722;1, and lower percolation threshold of 0.504 wt%. Moreover, the prepared sensors also possess an impressively thermal response (0.01636 &#176;C&#8722;1) and realize the application in the measurement of human body temperature. The multifunctional and scalable XSBR/SSCNT sensor with the integrated tracking capabilities of real&#8208;time and in situ physiological signals, providing a promising route to develop wearable artificial intelligence in human health and sporting applications.

         <title>Training the Polarization in Integrated La0.15Bi0.85FeO3&#8208;Based Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A persisting net in&#8208;plane polarization in highly La&#8208;substituted multiferroic BiFeO3 films is probed operando using non&#8208;invasive optical second&#8208;harmonic generation directly in prototypical magnetoelectric device architectures. A spontaneous domain structure reordering triggered by the first electrical cycles leads to an abrupt enhancement of this net in&#8208;plane polarization.








Abstract
The functionalities of BiFeO3&#8208;based magnetoelectric multiferroic heterostructures rely on the controlled manipulation of their ferroelectric domains and of the corresponding net in&#8208;plane polarization, as this aspect guides the voltage&#8208;controlled magnetic switching. Chemical substitution has emerged as a key to push the energy dissipation of the BiFeO3 into the attojoule range but appears to result in a disordered domain configuration. Using non&#8208;invasive optical second&#8208;harmonic generation on heavily La&#8208;substituted BiFeO3 films, it is shown that a weak net in&#8208;plane polarization remains imprinted in the pristine films despite the apparent domain disorder. It is found that this ingrained net in&#8208;plane polarization can be trained with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane electric fields compatible with applications. Operando studies on capacitor heterostructures treated in this way show the full restoration of the domain configuration of pristine BiFeO3 along with a giant net in&#8208;plane polarization enhancement. Thus, the experiments reveal a surprising robustness of the net in&#8208;plane polarization of BiFeO3 against chemical modification, an important criterion in ongoing attempts to integrate magnetoelectric materials into energy&#8208;efficient devices.

         <title>Synthesis of Pd3Sn and PdCuSn Nanorods with L12 Phase for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Ethanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
L12 PdCuSn, L12 Pd3Sn, and fcc Pd3Sn nanorods are controlled synthesized using a facile, one&#8208;pot, wet&#8208;chemical method. The as&#8208;synthesized ternary L12 PdCuSn nanorods exhibit a remarkable electrocatalytic activity toward the ethanol oxidation reaction in alkaline media with better performance compared to the L12 Pd3Sn nanorods, fcc Pd3Sn nanorods, and the commercial Pd/C catalyst.








Abstract
The crystal phase of nanomaterials is one of the key parameters determining their physicochemical properties and performance in various applications. However, it still remains a great challenge to synthesize nanomaterials with different crystal phases while maintaining the same composition, size, and morphology. Here, a facile, one&#8208;pot, wet&#8208;chemical method is reported to synthesize Pd3Sn nanorods with comparable size and morphology but different crystal phases, that is, an ordered intermetallic and a disordered alloy with L12 and face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) phases, respectively. The crystal phase of the as&#8208;synthesized Pd3Sn nanorods is easily tuned by altering the types of tin precursors and solvents. Moreover, the approach can also be used to synthesize ternary PdCuSn nanorods with the L12 crystal phase. When used as electrocatalysts, the L12 Pd3Sn nanorods exhibit superior electrocatalytic performance toward the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) compared to their fcc counterpart. Impressively, compared to the L12 Pd3Sn nanorods, the ternary L12 PdCuSn nanorods exhibit more enhanced electrocatalytic performance toward the EOR, yielding a high mass current density up to 6.22 A mgPd&#8722;1, which is superior to the commercial Pd/C catalyst and among the best reported Pd&#8208;based EOR electrocatalysts.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Friction MSCs Delivery System Improves the Therapy for Severe Osteoarthritis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA supramolecular hydrogel is employed as bone marrow MSCs (BMSCs) carrier to treat osteoarthritis (OA). Compared with current clinical strategies, DNA supramolecular hydrogel can significantly improve the vitality of BMSCs during delivery, and provide cells with long&#8208;term anti&#8208;friction protection, excellent permeability, 3D support, and 3D microenvironment of cell proliferation and differentiation, ultimately enhancing the therapeutic effect of BMSCs.








Abstract
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a musculoskeletal disorder disease affecting about 500 million people worldwide and mesenchymal sem cells (MSCs) therapy has been demonstrated as a potential strategy to treat OA. However, the shear forces during direct injection and the harsher shear condition of OA environments would lead to significant cell damage and inhibit the therapeutic efficacy. Herein, DNA supramolecular hydrogel has been applied as delivering material for MSCs to treat severe OA model, which perform extraordinary protection in MSCs against the shear force both in vitro and in vivo. It is demonstrated that the DNA supramolecular hydrogel can promote formation of quality cartilage, reduce osteophyte, and normalize subchondral bone under the high friction condition of OA, whose molecular mechanisms underlying therapeutic effects are also investigated. It can be anticipated that DNA supramolecular hydrogel would be a promising cell delivery system for multiple potential MSCs therapy.

         <title>Designing Artificial Vibration Modes of Piezoelectric Devices Using Programmable, 3D Ordered Structure with Piezoceramic Strain Units</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmable, 3D ordered structure with piezoceramic strain units (3D OSPSU) is proposed to artificially generate basic modes, such as flexural, extension, shear, torsion, and even coupled modes in a broad frequency band other than only at eigenfrequency. A five&#8208;degree&#8208;of&#8208;freedom micro&#8211;nano actuating platform based on only one 3D OSPSU is constructed, indicating the potential for nano&#8208;operation in microelectronic manufacturing.








Abstract
Piezoelectric ceramic devices, which utilize multifarious vibration modes to realize electromechanical coupling and energy conversions, are extensively used in high&#8208;technological fields. However, the excitation of basic modes is mainly subjected to natural eigenfrequency of ceramic devices, which is related to the structure and material parameters.

To validate the 3D OSPSU method, a five&#8208;degree&#8208;of&#8208;freedom micro&#8211;nano actuating platform based on only one co&#8208;fired multilayer ceramic is constructed.

         <title>Lead&#8208;Dominated Hyperfine Interaction Impacting the Carrier Spin Dynamics in Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building up on the excellent optical properties of perovskite materials, the electron and hole spin dynamics provide fundamental insights into the carrier&#8211;nuclear spin system. In the model perovskite, bulk FA0.9Cs0.1PbI2.8Br0.2, Land&#233; factors, key spin relaxation times, and mechanisms are determined. Optically detected NMR reveals the dominance of the lead spin hyperfine interaction at the top of the valence band.








Abstract
The outstanding optical quality of lead halide perovskites inspires studies of their potential for the optical control of carrier spins as pursued in other materials. Entering largely uncharted territory, time&#8208;resolved pump&#8211;probe Kerr rotation is used to explore the coherent spin dynamics of electrons and holes in bulk formamidinium caesium lead iodine bromide (FA0.9Cs0.1PbI2.8Br0.2) and to determine key parameters characterizing interactions of their spins, such as the g&#8208;factors and relaxation times. The demonstrated long spin dynamics and narrow g&#8208;factor distribution prove the perovskites as promising competitors for conventional semiconductors in spintronics. The dynamic nuclear polarization via spin&#8208;oriented holes is realized and the identification of the lead (207Pb) isotope in optically detected nuclear magnetic resonance proves that the hole&#8211;nuclei interaction is dominated by the lead ions. A detailed theoretical analysis accounting for the specifics of the lead halide perovskite materials allows the evaluation of the underlying hyperfine interaction constants, both for electrons and holes. Recombination and spin dynamics evidence that at low temperatures, photogenerated electrons and holes are localized at different regions of the perovskite crystal, resulting in their long lifetimes up to 44&#160;&#956;s. The findings form the base for the tailored development of spin&#8208;optoelectronic applications for the large family of lead halide perovskites and their&#160;nanostructures.

         <title>Encapsulation of Metallic Zn in a Hybrid MXene/Graphene Aerogel as a Stable Zn Anode for Foldable Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite anode of metallic zinc (Zn) in graphene&#8211;MXene aerogel is prepared for Zn&#8208;ion batteries. The Zn metal is completely encapsulated inside the host in a 3D microscale manner, which suppresses the side reactions and regulates the Zn deposition. Meanwhile, the aerogel, with excellent flexibility, achieves stable electrochemical performance for foldable Zn&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
A 3D host can effectively mitigate the dendritic growth of a zinc (Zn)&#8208;metal anode. However, the increased electrode/electrolyte reaction area using the 3D substrate accelerates the passivation and corrosion at the anode interface, ultimately degrading the electrochemical performance. Here, an oriented freezing process is used to create a flexible MXene/graphene scaffold. Based on the abundant zincophilic traits and micropores in the structure, Zn is densely encapsulated inside the host by the electrodeposition process. During cycling, the composite anode endows an in situ solid electrolyte interface with zinc fluoride at the electrode/electrolyte interface due to inherent fluorine terminations in MXene, efficiently inhibiting the dendritic growth. Furthermore, the design wherein bulk Zn is distributed in a 3D microscale manner suppresses hydrogen evolution reactions (3.8&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) and passivation, through in/ex situ tests. As a result, in a symmetrical cell test, the electrode has a long&#8208;cycling life of over 1000 h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. After continuous single folding followed by double folding, a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state foldable cell with the composite anode and a LiMn2O4 cathode (60% depth of discharge) maintains high&#8208;capacity retention of over 91%. This research presents a revolutionary encapsulating idea for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries, as well as foldable investigation.

         <title>Spatiotemporally Controllable Distribution of Combination Therapeutics in Solid Tumors by Dually Modified Bacteria</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methods capable of distributing antitumor therapeutics uniformly and durably throughout an entire tumor would be of great significance in maximizing their treatment efficacy but have proven to be extremely challenging. In this work, bacteria&#8208;mediated spatiotemporally controllable distribution of combination therapeutics is described in solid tumors, which can reprogram the immune microenvironment for optimizing antitumor efficacy.








Abstract
Methods capable of distributing antitumor therapeutics uniformly and durably throughout an entire tumor would be of great significance in maximizing their treatment efficacy, but they have proven to be extremely challenging. Here, bacteria&#8208;mediated spatiotemporally controllable distribution of combination therapeutics in solid tumors is reported to reprogram the immune microenvironment for optimizing antitumor efficacy. By combining synthetic biology and interfacial chemistry, bacteria are inside and outside concurrently modified to express photothermal melanin and to attach immune checkpoint inhibitors on their surface. Due to the nature of bacteria to colonize the hypoxia intratumoral environment, both therapeutic agents can be distributed homogenously and lastingly in tumors during ex vivo human and in vivo mouse studies. Spatiotemporally controllable localization of melanin can repeatedly generate a moderate yet uniform heating of the tumor upon light exposure in a broad treatment window. Combination with similarly localized inhibitors elicits a dual photothermally stimulated and checkpoint&#8208;blockade&#8208;mediated immune activation effect, synergistically reprogramming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Therapeutic values are demonstrated by significantly inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival of mice in both subcutaneous and orthotopic murine models. Colonization of dually modified bacteria paves an avenue for spatiotemporally controllable distribution of therapeutic drugs in solid tumors.

         <title>Digital Light Processing Based Bioprinting with Composable Gradients</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Digital Light Processing based (bio)printing system is developed, integrating a microfluidic mixer for the generation of composable gradients of desired (bio)inks on the fly. Various planar and volumetric structures exhibiting continual gradients of materials, cell densities, growth factor concentrations, hydrogel stiffness, and porosities in horizontal and/or vertical direction, are exemplified, suggesting the promising potential of the technology toward biomedical applications.








Abstract
Recapitulation of complex tissues signifies a remarkable challenge and, to date, only a few approaches have emerged that can efficiently reconstruct necessary gradients in 3D constructs. This is true even though mimicry of these gradients is of great importance to establish the functionality of engineered tissues and devices. Here, a composable&#8208;gradient Digital Light Processing (DLP)&#8208;based (bio)printing system is developed, utilizing the unprecedented integration of a microfluidic mixer for the generation of either continual or discrete gradients of desired (bio)inks in real time. Notably, the precisely controlled gradients are composable on&#8208;the&#8208;fly by facilely by adjusting the (bio)ink flow ratios. In addition, this setup is designed in such a way that (bio)ink waste is minimized when exchanging the gradient (bio)inks, further enhancing this time&#8208; and (bio)ink&#8208;saving strategy. Various planar and 3D structures exhibiting continual gradients of materials, of cell densities, of growth factor concentrations, of hydrogel stiffness, and of porosities in horizontal and/or vertical direction, are exemplified. The composable fabrication of multifunctional gradients strongly supports the potential of the unique bioprinting system in numerous biomedical applications.

         <title>Ratiometric FRET Encoded Hierarchical ZrMOF&#8202;@&#8202;Au Cluster for Ultrasensitive Quantifying MicroRNA In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The developed probes enable the ultrasensitive quantifying microRNA with zeptomolar level and the distinct imaging&#8208;based monitoring of cancer marker miR&#8208;21 both in living cells and in vivo, which offers new avenues for simultaneous diagnoses and treatments of early&#8208;stage cancers.








Abstract
Here, Zirconium metal&#8722;organic frameworks&#8202;@&#8202;gold (ZrMOF&#8202;@&#8202;Au) cluster architectures have been fabricated and then functionalized with two fluorescent dyes (Quasar [QS] and Cyanine5.5 [Cy5.5]) through deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization, to form a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) encoded ZrMOF&#8202;&#8202;@&#8202;&#8202;Au&#8208;QS/Cy5.5 complex. In the presence of the target intracellular microRNA (miR)&#8208;21, the fluorescence of Cy5.5 at 705&#160;nm (F705) decreases and the fluorescence of QS at 665&#160;nm (F665) increases when Cy5.5 is released from the surface of ZrMOF&#8202;&#8202;@&#8202;&#8202;Au&#8208;QS/Cy5.5. The change in the fluorescence ratio (F705/F665) shows an outstanding linear range of 0.006&#8211;67.9 amol/ngRNA, and the limit of detection is 4.51 zmol/ngRNA in living cells. The high ratio loading of nucleic acid on surface of ZrMOF&#8202;@&#8202;Au cluster and two fluorescence encoded signal enables better sensitivity and reliability. Zeptomolar sensitivity and good linearity against target affords distinct imaging&#8208;based monitoring of the cancer marker miR&#8208;21 both in living cells and in vivo. At the same time, the architecture displays remarkable photothermal conversion efficiency (53.7%) and gives rise to outstanding therapy ability in vivo. This strategy offers new avenues for the intelligent quantification of miRNAs for simultaneous diagnoses and treatments of early&#8208;stage cancers.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancy Injection as a Pathway to Enhancing Electromechanical Response in Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhanced electromechanical response in BaTiO3 thin films driven via local oxygen vacancy migration is observed via temperature dependent band excitation piezoresponse force microscopy. Observations are supported by finite element modeling, reactive force field, and density functional theory calculations pointing toward the discovery of a new method of enhancing functional responses in ferroelectrics.








Abstract
Since their discovery in late 1940s, perovskite ferroelectric materials have become one of the central objects of condensed matter physics and materials science due to the broad spectrum of functional behaviors they exhibit, including electro&#8208;optical phenomena and strong electromechanical coupling. In such disordered materials, the static properties of defects such as oxygen vacancies are well explored but the dynamic effects are less understood. In this work, the first observation of enhanced electromechanical response in BaTiO3 thin films is reported driven via dynamic local oxygen vacancy control in piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). A persistence in peizoelectricity past the bulk Curie temperature and an enhanced electromechanical response due to a created internal electric field that further enhances the intrinsic electrostriction are explicitly demonstrated. The findings are supported by a series of temperature dependent band excitation PFM in ultrahigh vacuum and a combination of modeling techniques including finite element modeling, reactive force field, and density functional theory. This study shows the pivotal role that dynamics of vacancies in complex oxides can play in determining functional properties and thus provides a new route toward&#8211; achieving enhanced ferroic response with higher functional temperature windows in ferroelectrics and other ferroic materials.

         <title>Mesenchymal Stem Cell&#8208;Derived Extracellular Vesicles with High PD&#8208;L1 Expression for Autoimmune Diseases Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;expressing programmed cell death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are prepared for autoimmune diseases treatment. As cell&#8208;free carrier, MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 restore tissue lesion by reshaping the local immune microenvironment via programmed cell death&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;1)/PD&#8208;L1 pathway, which may potentially provide a universal platform technique for the immunotherapy of various autoimmune diseases.








Abstract
Autoimmune diseases are the third most common disease influencing the quality of life of many patients. Here, a programmed cell death&#8208;ligand 1 + (PD&#8208;L1) mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) derived extracellular vesicles (MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1) using lentivirus&#8208;mediated gene transfection technology is developed for reconfiguration of the local immune microenvironment of affected tissue in autoimmune diseases. MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 exhibits an impressive ability to regulate various activated immune cells to an immunosuppressed state in vitro. More importantly, in dextran sulfate sodium&#8208;induced ulcerative colitis (UC) and imiquimod&#8208;induced psoriasis mouse models, a significantly high accumulation of MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 is observed in the inflamed tissues compared to the PD&#8208;L1+ MSCs. Therapeutic efficiency in both UC and psoriasis mouse disease models is demonstrated using MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 to reshape the inflammatory ecosystem in the local immune context. A technology is developed using MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 as a natural delivery platform for autoimmune diseases treatment with high clinical potential.

         <title>Tissue Engineering with Mechanically Induced Solid&#8208;Fluid Transitions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tissues composed of a collagenous core surrounded by an epithelial sheet serve as shape&#8208;programmable living matter. The shaping process involves solid to fluid transitions in the epithelium induced by mechanical perturbations, and the generation of spatially distributed surface stresses at the interfaces. Optochemical and microsurgical operations generate a new shape that is autonomously stabilized by the re&#8208;epithelization process.








Abstract
Epithelia are contiguous sheets of cells that stabilize the shape of internal organs and support their structure by covering their surfaces. They acquire diverse morphological forms appropriate for their specific functions during embryonic development, such as the kidney tubules and the complex branching structures found in the lung. The maintenance of epithelial morphogenesis and homeostasis is controlled by their remarkable mechanics&#8212;epithelia can become elastic, plastic, and viscous by actively remodeling cell&#8211;cell junctions and modulating the distribution of local stresses. Microfabrication, finite element modelling, light&#8208;sheet microscopy, and robotic micromanipulation are used to show that collagen gels covered with an epithelial skin serve as shape&#8208;programmable soft matter. The process involves solid to fluid transitions induced by mechanical perturbations, generates spatially distributed surface stresses at tissue interfaces, and is amenable to both additive and subtractive manufacturing techniques. The robustness and versatility of this strategy for engineering designer tissues is demonstrated by directing the morphogenesis of a variety of molded, carved, and assembled forms from the base material. The results provide insight into the active mechanical properties of the epithelia and establish methods for engineering tissues with sustainable architectures.

         <title>Simultaneously Blocking Chemical Crosstalk and Internal Short Circuit via Gel&#8208;Stretching Derived Nanoporous Non&#8208;Shrinkage Separator for Safe Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;shrinkage nanoporous separator is designed for enhancing the safety of lithium&#8208;ion battery through a novel gel&#8208;stretching strategy. Both internal short circuit and chemical crossover within the battery are simultaneously prevented when the separator is employed. The results elucidate the underlying mechanism to ensure battery safety and highlight the design principles for advanced separators.








Abstract
The separator, an ionic permeable and electronic insulating membrane between cathode and anode, plays a crucial role in the electrochemical and safety performance of batteries. However, commercial polyolefin separators not only suffer from inevitable thermal shrinkage at elevated temperature, but also fail to inhibit the hidden chemical crosstalk of reactive gases such as O2, leading to often reported thermal runaway (TR) and hence preventing large&#8208;scale implementation of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, a nanoporous non&#8208;shrinkage separator (GS&#8208;PI) is fabricated via a novel gel&#8208;stretching orientation approach to eliminate TR. In situ synchrotron small angle X&#8208;ray scattering during heating clearly shows that the as&#8208;prepared thin GS&#8208;PI separator exhibits superior mechanical tolerance at high temperature, thus effectively preventing internal short circuit.

&lt;p&gt;A non-shrinkage nanoporous separator is designed for enhancing the safety of lithium-ion battery through a novel gel-stretching strategy. Both internal short circuit and chemical crossover within the battery are simultaneously prevented when the separator is employed. The results elucidate the underlying mechanism to ensure battery safety and highlight the design principles for advanced separators.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The separator, an ionic permeable and electronic insulating membrane between cathode and anode, plays a crucial role in the electrochemical and safety performance of batteries. However, commercial polyolefin separators not only suffer from inevitable thermal shrinkage at elevated temperature, but also fail to inhibit the hidden chemical crosstalk of reactive gases such as O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, leading to often reported thermal runaway (TR) and hence preventing large-scale implementation of high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries. Herein, a nanoporous non-shrinkage separator (GS-PI) is fabricated via a novel gel-stretching orientation approach to eliminate TR. In situ synchrotron small angle X-ray scattering during heating clearly shows that the as-prepared thin GS-PI separator exhibits superior mechanical tolerance at high temperature, thus effectively preventing internal short circuit. Meanwhile, the unique nanoporous structure design further blocks chemical crosstalk and the associated exothermic reactions. Accelerating rate calorimetry tests reveal that the practical 1 Ah LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NCM622)/graphite pouch cell using GS-PI nanoporous separator show a maximum temperature rise (dT/dt&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) of only 3.7&#160;&#176;C s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; compared to 131.6&#160;&#176;C s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in the case of Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@PE macroporous separator. Moreover, despite the reduced pore size, the GS-PI separator demonstrates better cycling stability than conventional Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@PE separator at high temperature without sacrificing specific capacity and rate capability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Catalytic Small Interfering RNA Nanocarriers for Synergistic Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;catalytic siRNA nanocarriers S/Ce&#8208;PABMS with a ceria (CeO2) nanozymes&#8208;mediated rough surface can catalyze the delivery process and amplify the cellular uptake efficiency. The CeO2 nanozymes catalyze excess reactive oxygen species scavenging and cooperate with siSNCA to reduce the formation of &#945;&#8208;syn aggregates in the treatment process. S/Ce&#8208;PABMS exhibit superior synergistic treatment effects and significantly improve dyskinesia of Parkinson's disease mice.








Abstract
Gene therapy has shown great potential for neurodegenerative diseases with complex pathology. However, its therapeutic effect is limited due to the delivery barriers and its own single function. Herein, self&#8208;catalytic small interfering RNA (siRNA) nanocarriers (S/Ce&#8208;PABMS) are developed to catalyze delivery process and treatment process for synergistic treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. On the one hand, the rough surface of the S/Ce&#8208;PABMS mediated by ceria (CeO2) nanozymes can catalyze cellular uptake in the delivery process, so that S/Ce&#8208;PABMS with acetylcholine analogs penetrate the blood&#8211;brain barrier and enter neurons more effectively. On the other hand, the CeO2 nanozymes can catalyze the treatment process by scavenging excess reactive oxygen species, and cooperate with siRNA&#8208;targeting SNCA to decrease the &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;syn) aggregation and alleviate the Parkinsonian pathology. Moreover, the S/Ce&#8208;PABMS treatment reduces the number of activated microglia and regulates the release of inflammatory cytokine, thereby relieving neuroinflammation. After treatment with S/Ce&#8208;PABMS, dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease model mice is significantly alleviated. The finding shows that the self&#8208;catalytic nanocarriers, S/Ce&#8208;PABMS, have great potential in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Silk Microneedle Patch Capable of On&#8208;Demand Multidrug Delivery to the Brain for Glioblastoma Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silk microneedle (SMN) patch allows the integration of multiple therapeutic drugs with controlled release profiles to stop bleeding, inhibit angiogenesis, and promote apoptosis of glioblastoma cells. Drug release kinetics are well&#8208;defined by tuning the crosslinking degree of silk and applying a trigger of transcranial near&#8208;infrared light. SMN effectively suppresses tumor volume and improves the survival rate of mice in vivo.








Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor. Surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy remains the standard treatment strategy for GBM patients. However, challenges still exist when surgery is difficult or impossible to remove the tumor completely. Herein, the design, fabrication and application of a heterogenous silk fibroin microneedle (SMN) patch is reported for circumventing the blood&#8208;brain barrier and releasing multiple drugs directly to the tumor site for drug combination treatment. The biocompatible and biodegradable SMN patch can dissolve slowly over time, allowing the sustained release of multiple drugs at different doses. Furthermore, it can be triggered remotely to induce rapid drug delivery at a designated stage after implantation. In the GBM mouse models, two clinically relevant chemotherapeutic agents (thrombin and temozolomide) and targeted drug (bevacizumab) are loaded into the SMN patch with individually controlled release profiles. The drugs are spatiotemporally and sequentially delivered for hemostasis, anti&#8208;angiogenesis, and apoptosis of tumor cells. Device application is non&#8208;toxic and results in decreased tumor volume and increased survival rate in mice. The SMN patch with on&#8208;demand multidrug delivery has potential applications for the combined administration of therapeutic drugs for the clinical treatment of brain tumors when other methods are insufficient.

         <title>Vertically Stacked Full Color Quantum Dots Phototransistor Arrays for High&#8208;Resolution and Enhanced Color&#8208;Selective Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolithic integration of vertically stacked red (R), green (G), and blue (B) quantum dots (QDs), from chalcometallate RGB QD precursor films, with amorphous oxide semiconductor indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide phototransistor arrays for high&#8208;resolution active&#8208;matrix driving of color&#8208;selective multispectral photodetection is demonstrated. Efficient QD connectivity for reduced trap density and photopatternability essential for pixelation are achieved, which result in ultrahigh photosensitive optoelectronic properties.








Abstract
Color&#8208;selective multifunctional and multiplexed photodetectors have attracted considerable interest with the increasing demand for color filter&#8208;free optoelectronics which can simultaneously process multispectral signal via minimized system complexity. The low efficiency of color&#8208;filter technology and conventional laterally pixelated photodetector array structures often limit opportunities for widespread realization of high&#8208;density photodetectors. Here, low&#8208;temperature solution&#8208;processed vertically stacked full color quantum dot (QD) phototransistor arrays are developed on plastic substrates for high&#8208;resolution color&#8208;selective photosensor applications. Particularly, the three different&#8208;sized/color (RGB) QDs are vertically stacked and pixelated via direct photopatterning using a unique chelating chalcometallate ligand functioning both as solubilizing component and, after photoexposure, a semiconducting cement creating robust, insoluble, and charge&#8208;efficient QD layers localized in the a&#8208;IGZO transistor region, resulting in efficient wavelength&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;induced charge transfer. Thus, high&#8208;resolution vertically stacked full color QD photodetector arrays are successfully implemented with the density of 5500 devices cm&#8211;2 on ultrathin flexible polymeric substrates with highly photosensitive characteristics such as photoresponsivity (1.1 &#215; 104 AW&#8211;1) and photodetectivity (1.1 &#215; 1018 Jones) as well as wide dynamic ranges (&gt;150&#160;dB).

         <title>Breaking the Efficiency Limit of Deep&#8208;Blue Fluorescent OLEDs Based on Anthracene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA) process can recycle nonradiative triplet excitons to radiative singlet excitons and enhance the efficiency of fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Conventionally, the theoretical limit of delayed emission ratio by the TTA process is known to be 37.5% in anthracene&#8208;based molecules. In this work, 48% of delayed emission ratio is achieved by TTA with carefully designed blue OLEDs.








Abstract
Triplet harvesting is important for the realization of high&#8208;efficiency fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA) is one triplet&#8208;harvesting strategy. However, for blue&#8208;emitting anthracene derivatives, the theoretical maximum radiative singlet&#8208;exciton ratio generated from the TTA process is known to be 15% in addition to the initially generated singlets of 25%, which is insufficient for high&#8208;efficiency fluorescent devices. In this study, nearly 25% of the radiative singlet&#8208;exciton ratio is realized by TTA using an anthracene derivative, breaking the theoretical limit. As a result, efficient deep&#8208;blue TTA fluorescent devices are developed, exhibiting external quantum efficiencies of 10.2% and 8.6% with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage color coordinates of (0.134, 0.131) and (0.137, 0.076), respectively. The theoretical model provided herein explains the experimental results considering both the TTA and reverse intersystem crossing to a singlet state from higher triplet states formed by the TTA, clearly demonstrating that the radiative singlet ratio generated from TTA can reach 37.5% (total radiative singlet&#8208;exciton ratio: 62.5%), well above 15% (total 40%), despite the molecule having S1, T2&#160;&lt;&#160;2T1&#160;&lt; Q1 energy levels, which will lead to the development of high&#8208;efficiency fluorescent OLEDs with external quantum efficiencies exceeding 28% if the outcoupling efficiency is 45%.

&lt;p&gt;Triplet harvesting is important for the realization of high-efficiency fluorescent organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA) is one triplet-harvesting strategy. However, for blue-emitting anthracene derivatives, the theoretical maximum radiative singlet-exciton ratio generated from the TTA process is known to be 15% in addition to the initially generated singlets of 25%, which is insufficient for high-efficiency fluorescent devices. In this study, nearly 25% of the radiative singlet-exciton ratio is realized by TTA using an anthracene derivative, breaking the theoretical limit. As a result, efficient deep-blue TTA fluorescent devices are developed, exhibiting external quantum efficiencies of 10.2% and 8.6% with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage color coordinates of (0.134, 0.131) and (0.137, 0.076), respectively. The theoretical model provided herein explains the experimental results considering both the TTA and reverse intersystem crossing to a singlet state from higher triplet states formed by the TTA, clearly demonstrating that the radiative singlet ratio generated from TTA can reach 37.5% (total radiative singlet-exciton ratio: 62.5%), well above 15% (total 40%), despite the molecule having S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;&amp;lt;&#160;2T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;&amp;lt; Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; energy levels, which will lead to the development of high-efficiency fluorescent OLEDs with external quantum efficiencies exceeding 28% if the outcoupling efficiency is 45%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Universal Existence of Localized Single&#8208;Photon Emitters in the Perovskite Film of All&#8208;Inorganic CsPbBr3 Microcrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;photon emitters are universally observed from all&#8208;inorganic perovskite films at the cryogenic temperature, owing to local thickness variations of the composing CsPbBr3 microcrystals and the resulting low potential&#8208;energy regions. The discovery of such novel emitting species in a perovskite film, with the enriched structure&#8211;property relationship, will impart significant influences on the advancement of relevant optoelectronic devices and quantum&#8208;light sources.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic halide perovskites have drawn a lot of research attention very recently owing to their potential solution to the instability issue currently faced by the organic&#8211;inorganic counterparts. Meanwhile, the halide perovskites in a solid film are manifested as microscale morphologies whose functionalities are unavoidably affected by the interior or exterior presence of various nanoscale entities. Here all&#8208;inorganic solid films are fabricated with varying densities of single CsPbBr3 microcrystals, showing that very sharp photoluminescence peaks can be universally observed at 4 K with the linewidths being as narrow as hundreds of &#956;eV. The single&#8208;photon emission nature is confirmed for such a photoluminescence peak, whose intensity is completely quenched above &#8776;30&#160;K to suggest its possible origin from a low potential&#8208;energy region of the single microcrystal. The discovery of such a novel emitting species in halide perovskites, with the enriched structure&#8211;property relationship, will surely impart significant influences on the advancement of relevant optoelectronic devices and quantum&#8208;light sources.

         <title>Interfacial Manipulation via In Situ Grown ZnSe Cultivator toward Highly Reversible Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ grown ZnSe overlayer functioning as a cultivator can guide oriented growth of Zn (002) plane at the infancy stage of stripping/plating cycles, thereby inhibiting the formation of Zn dendrites and the occurrence of side reactions.








Abstract
Zn metal anode has garnered growing scientific and industrial interest owing to its appropriate redox potential, low cost, and high safety. Nevertheless, the instability of Zn anode caused by dendrite formation, hydrogen evolution, and side reactions has greatly hampered its commercialization. Herein, an in situ grown ZnSe overlayer is crafted over one side of commercial Zn foil via chemical vapor deposition in a scalable manner, aiming to achieve optimized electrolyte/Zn interfaces with large&#8208;scale viability. Impressively, thus&#8208;derived ZnSe coating functions as a cultivator to guide oriented growth of Zn (002) plane at the infancy stage of stripping/plating cycles, thereby inhibiting the formation of Zn dendrites and the occurrence of side reactions. As a result, high cyclic stability (1530 h at 1.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/1.0&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2; 172 h at 30.0&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2/10.0 mAh cm&#8722;2) in symmetric cells is harvested. Meanwhile, when paired with V2O5 based cathode, assembled full cell achieves an outstanding capacity (194.5 mAh g&#8722;1) and elongated lifespan (a&#160;capacity retention of 84% after 1000 cycles) at 5.0 A g&#8722;1. The reversible Zn anode enabled by the interfacial manipulation strategy via ZnSe cultivator is anticipated to satisfy the demand of commercial use.

         <title>Wafer&#8208;Scale Electroactive Nanoporous Silicon: Large and Fully Reversible Electrochemo&#8208;Mechanical Actuation in Aqueous Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For large&#8208;scale nanoporous silicon cantilevers in aqueous electrolytes, with laser cantilever bending experiments, electrosorption&#8208;induced mechanical stress generation of up to 600&#8201;kPa that is reversible and adjustable at will by low operation voltages of 1&#8201;V is demonstrated. A comparison with planar silicon surfaces reveals mechanistic insights on the observed electrocapillarity upon ion adsorption and desorption.








Abstract
Nanoporosity in silicon results in interface&#8208;dominated mechanics, fluidics, and photonics that are often superior to the ones of the bulk material. However, their active control, for example, by electronic stimuli, is challenging due to the absence of intrinsic piezoelectricity in the base material. Here, for large&#8208;scale nanoporous silicon cantilevers wetted by aqueous electrolytes, electrosorption&#8208;induced mechanical stress generation of up to 600&#8201;kPa that is reversible and adjustable at will by potential variations of &#8776;1&#8201;V is shown. Laser cantilever bending experiments in combination with in operando voltammetry and step coulombmetry allow this large electro&#8208;actuation to be traced to the concerted action of 100 billions of parallel nanopores per square centimeter cross&#8208;section and determination of the capacitive charge&#8211;stress coupling parameter upon ion adsorption and desorption as well as the intimately related stress actuation dynamics for perchloric and isotonic saline solutions. A comparison with planar silicon surfaces reveals mechanistic insights on the observed electrocapillarity (Hellmann&#8211;Feynman interactions) with respect to the importance of oxide formation and wall roughness on the single&#8208;nanopore scale. The observation of robust electrochemo&#8208;mechanical actuation in a mainstream semiconductor with wafer&#8208;scale, self&#8208;organized nanoporosity opens up novel opportunities for on&#8208;chip integrated stress generation and actuorics at exceptionally low operation&#160;voltages.

         <title>Interfacial Electrostatic&#8208;Interaction&#8208;Enhanced Photomultiplication for Ultrahigh External Quantum Efficiency of Organic Photodiodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to boost the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of photomultiplication&#8208;type organic photodiodes (OPDs) is suggested by stabilizing trapped electron states within the active layer via electrostatic interactions. By introducing an ionic electrolyte interfacial layer and by the resulting built&#8208;in electrostatic interaction, an ultrahigh EQE (&gt;2&#160;000&#160;000%), responsivity (&gt; 10&#160;000 A W&#8722;1), and visible specific detectivity (&gt;1014 Jones) for OPDs is reported.








Abstract
A photomultiplication&#8208;type organic photodiode (PM&#8208;OPD), where an electric double layer (EDL) is strategically embedded, is demonstrated, with an exceptionally high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 2&#160;210&#160;000%, responsivity of 11&#160;200 A W&#8722;1, specific detectivity of 2.11 &#215; 1014 Jones, and gain&#8211;bandwidth product of 1.92 &#215; 107&#160;Hz, as well as high reproducibility. A polymer electrolyte, poly(9,9&#8208;bis(3&#8242;&#8208;(N,N&#8208;dimethyl)&#8208;N&#8208;ethylammoinium&#8208;propyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;fluorene)&#8208;alt&#8208;2,7&#8208;(9,9&#8208;dioctylfluorene))dibromide is employed as a work&#8208;function&#8208;modifying layer of indium tin oxide (ITO) to construct an EDL&#8208;embedded Schottky junction with p&#8208;type polymer semiconductor, poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene&#8208;diyl), resulting in not only advantageous tuning of the work function of ITO but also an enhancement of the electron&#8208;trapping efficiency due to electrostatic interaction between exposed cations and trapped electrons within isolated acceptor domains. The effects of the EDL on the energetics of the trapped electron states and thus on the gain generation mechanism are confirmed by numerical simulations based on the drift&#8211;diffusion approximation of charge carriers. The feasibility of the fabricated high&#8208;EQE PM&#8208;OPD especially for weak light detection is demonstrated via a pixelated prototype image sensor. It is believed that this new OPD platform opens up the possibility for the ultrahigh&#8208;sensitivity organic image sensors, while maintaining the advantageous properties of organics.

         <title>The Importance of Surface Adsorbates in Solution&#8208;Processed Thermoelectric Materials: The Case of SnSe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polycrystalline SnSe is prepared from surfactant&#8208;free particles prepared in solution. Ionic species adsorbed on the surface compensate for the particles&#8242; charge and remain during processing. The adsorbates affect the nano/microstructure of the final material and its transport properties. In the case of sodium, it remains as a dopant and forms secondary phases that induce energy filtering effects.








Abstract
Solution synthesis of particles emerges as an alternative to prepare thermoelectric materials with less demanding processing conditions than conventional solid&#8208;state synthetic methods. However, solution synthesis generally involves the presence of additional molecules or ions belonging to the precursors or added to enable solubility and/or regulate nucleation and growth. These molecules or ions can end up in the particles as surface adsorbates and interfere in the material properties. This work demonstrates that ionic adsorbates, in particular Na+ ions, are electrostatically adsorbed in SnSe particles synthesized in water and play a crucial role not only in directing the material nano/microstructure but also in determining the transport properties of the consolidated material. In dense pellets prepared by sintering SnSe particles, Na remains within the crystal lattice as dopant, in dislocations, precipitates, and forming grain boundary complexions. These results highlight the importance of considering all the possible unintentional impurities to establish proper structure&#8211;property relationships and control material properties in solution&#8208;processed thermoelectric materials.

This review analyzes the key factors that hinder the reversible conversion of conversion&#8208;type materials, provides a fundamental understanding of graphene&#8208;, or graphene&#8208;like carbon&#8208;supported atomically dispersed metal catalysts (G&#8208;ADMCs), and provides guidance on the bifunctional G&#8208;ADMCs to be used in high&#8208;performance next&#8208;generation batteries, including aqueous metal&#8211;air batteries, nonaqueous alkali metal&#8208;O2 and &#8208;CO2 batteries, alkali metal&#8208;chalcogen batteries, and alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Next&#8208;generation batteries based on conversion reactions, including aqueous metal&#8211;air batteries, nonaqueous alkali metal&#8208;O2 and &#8208;CO2 batteries, alkali metal&#8208;chalcogen batteries, and alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries have attracted great interest. However, their use is restricted by inefficient reversible conversion of active agents. Developing bifunctional catalysts to accelerate the conversion reaction kinetics in both discharge and charge processes is urgently needed. Graphene&#8208;, or graphene&#8208;like carbon&#8208;supported atomically dispersed metal catalysts (G&#8208;ADMCs) have been demonstrated to show excellent activity in various electrocatalytic reactions, making them promising candidates. Different from G&#8208;ADMCs for catalysis, which only require high activity in one direction, G&#8208;ADMCs for rechargeable batteries should provide high activity in both discharging and charging. This review provides guidance for the design and fabrication of bifunctional G&#8208;ADMCs for next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries based on conversion reactions. The key challenges that prevent their reversible conversion, the origin of the activity of bifunctional G&#8208;ADMCs, and the current design principles of bifunctional G&#8208;ADMCs for highly reversible conversion, have been analyzed and highlighted for each conversion&#8208;type battery. Finally, a summary and outlook on the development of bifunctional G&#8208;ADMC materials for next&#8208;generation batteries with a high energy density and excellent energy efficiency are given.

         <title>An Axially Continuous Graphene&#8211;Copper Wire for High&#8208;Power Transmission: Thermoelectrical Characterization and Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Axially continuous graphene layers on microscale&#8208;diameter copper wires offer significantly enhanced thermoelectrical properties including a 450% increase in the current density breakdown limit. The application of extremely large current densities (&gt;400 000 A cm&#8722;2) through these innovative graphene&#8211;metal wires is possibly due to 224% higher surface heat dissipation, 41% higher electrical conductivity, and improved thermal stability (i.e., 41.2% lower resistivity after thermal cycles up to 450 &#176;C).








Abstract
The demand for high&#8208;power electrical transmission continues to increase with technical advances in electric vehicles, unmanned drones, portable devices, and deployable military applications. In this study, significantly enhanced electrical properties (i.e., a 450% increase in the current density breakdown limit) are demonstrated by synthesizing axially continuous graphene layers on microscale&#8208;diameter wires. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the observed enhancements, the electrical properties of pure copper wires and axially continuous graphene&#8211;copper (ACGC) wires with three different diameters are characterized while controlling the experimental conditions, including ambient temperature, gases, and pressure. The study reveals that the main mechanism that allows the application of extremely large current densities (&gt;400 000 A cm&#8722;2) through the ACGC wires is threefold: the continuous graphene layers considerably improve: 1) surface heat dissipation (224% higher), 2) electrical conductivity (41% higher), and 3) thermal stability (41.2% lower resistivity after thermal cycles up to 450&#160;&#176;C), compared with pure copper wires. In addition, it is observed, through the use of high&#8208;speed camera images, that the ACGC wires exhibit very different failure behavior near the current density limit, compared with the pure copper wires.

         <title>Highly Selective and Sensitive Detection of Volatile Sulfur Compounds by Ionically Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through systematical design and comparison, Cu&#8208;TCPP stands out from a series of ionically conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (IC&#8208;MOFs) for volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) detection. H2S and CH3SH can be detected at concentrations down to 1 ppb and 1 ppm, respectively. The sensors display outstanding selectivity toward VSCs, and their low&#8208;cost and facile preparation make the devices disposable.








Abstract
High selectivity to specific analyte is essential for chemical sensors but difficult to achieve. For most chemical sensors, although the response to the target analyte can be more significant than interference analytes, they still show obvious responses to the interference analytes. Here, highly selective chemical sensors are developed with negligible responses to other interference vapors. Instead of the widely investigated electronically conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (EC&#8208;MOFs), ionically conductive MOFs (IC&#8208;MOFs) are used as the sensing materials, and the unique interaction between the ion charge carrier and the analyte is utilized to achieve high sensing selectivity. Through the modulation of the metal nodes (Cu, Co, Ni, Zn, Mg) and organic ligands (H2TCPP, H2THPP, H4BTEC), sensor arrays based on a set of IC&#8208;MOFs are fabricated and achieve highly selective detection toward volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs). H2S and CH3SH can be selectively detected at concentrations down to 1 ppb and 1&#160;ppm, respectively. The facile preparation and low cost endow the device with disposability. These results suggest new approaches for the development of highly selective chemical sensors.

         <title>Gas&#8208;Phase Fluorination of Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, scalable strategy is attempted using a direct gas&#8208;phase fluorination technique to fluorinate&#160;hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The nature of fluorine bonding to the&#160;hBN lattice and their chemical coordination are evaluated using various analytical techniques and theoretical models. Interestingly, the derived F&#8208;hBN displays significant improvement in its thermal and friction properties and displays a semiconducting behavior.








Abstract
Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has received much attention in recent years as a 2D dielectric material with potential applications ranging from catalysts to electronics. hBN is a stable covalent compound with a planar hexagonal lattice and is relatively unreactive to most chemical environments, making the chemical functionalization of hBN challenging. Here, a simple, scalable strategy to fluorinate hBN using a direct gas&#8208;phase fluorination technique is reported. The nature of fluorine bonding to the hBN lattice and their chemical coordination are described based on various characterization studies and theoretical models. The fluorine functionalized hBN shows a bandgap reduction and displays a semiconducting behavior due to the fluorination process. Additionally, the fluorinated hBN shows significant improvement in its thermal and friction properties, which could be substantial in applications such as lubricants and thermal fluids. Theory and simulations reveal that the enhanced friction properties of fluorinated hBN result from reduced inter&#8208;planar interaction energy by electrostatic repulsion of intercalated fluorine atoms between hBN layers without significant disruption of the in&#8208;plane lattice. This technique paves the way for the fluorination of several other 2D structures for various applications such as magnetism and functional nanoscale electronic devices.

     alt="Gas-Phase Fluorination of Hexagonal Boron Nitride"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple, scalable strategy is attempted using a direct gas-phase fluorination technique to fluorinate&#160;hexagonal boron nitride (&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;BN). The nature of fluorine bonding to the&#160;&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;BN lattice and their chemical coordination are evaluated using various analytical techniques and theoretical models. Interestingly, the derived F-&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;BN displays significant improvement in its thermal and friction properties and displays a semiconducting behavior.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hexagonal boron nitride (&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;BN) has received much attention in recent years as a 2D dielectric material with potential applications ranging from catalysts to electronics. &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;BN is a stable covalent compound with a planar hexagonal lattice and is relatively unreactive to most chemical environments, making the chemical functionalization of &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;BN challenging. Here, a simple, scalable strategy to fluorinate &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;BN using a direct gas-phase fluorination technique is reported. The nature of fluorine bonding to the &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;BN lattice and their chemical coordination are described based on various characterization studies and theoretical models. The fluorine functionalized &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;BN shows a bandgap reduction and displays a semiconducting behavior due to the fluorination process. Additionally, the fluorinated &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;BN shows significant improvement in its thermal and friction properties, which could be substantial in applications such as lubricants and thermal fluids. Theory and simulations reveal that the enhanced friction properties of fluorinated &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;BN result from reduced inter-planar interaction energy by electrostatic repulsion of intercalated fluorine atoms between &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;BN layers without significant disruption of the in-plane lattice. This technique paves the way for the fluorination of several other 2D structures for various applications such as magnetism and functional nanoscale electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strain&#8208;Enabled Phase Transition of Periodic Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strain&#8208;enabled phase transition of stretchable periodic metasurfaces between any two Bravais lattices, which reflect their symmetry, is demonstrated analytically and experimentally. Such transition offers a flexible way to engineer the resonance regime and dispersion relation of metasurfaces. In particular, the strain&#8208;induced symmetry lowering leads to linearly and circularly polarized dichroism, which is demonstrated for information decoding.








Abstract
Phase transitions are universal in solid&#8208;state matters, as well as in periodic electromagnetic metasurfaces&#8212;the photonic analogues of crystals. Although such transitions dictate the properties of active metasurfaces, universal ways to describe the structure transition of periodic metasurfaces have not yet been established. Here, the authors report the strain&#8208;enabled phase transition (or lattice deformation) of stretchable metasurfaces with the crystallographic description. They analytically and experimentally demonstrate the phase transition of plasmonic lattices between two arbitrary 2D Bravais lattices under certain strain configurations. The strain&#8208;induced symmetry lowering of the structures gives rise to optical anisotropy upon polarization, namely, linearly and circularly polarized dichroism. They further demonstrate the potential of phase transition in information decoding with applied strain. Interpreting the phase transition of metasurfaces from a standpoint of symmetry would accelerate the discovery of emergent properties, and provide a generalizable approach to designing active metasurfaces.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Perovskite Field&#8208;Effect Transistor Artificial Synapses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processed perovskite artificial synapse is demonstrated that emulates a biological synapse. The perovskite synapse employs a field&#8208;effect transistor layout with a ferroelectric gate dielectric, wherein the channel conductance can be updated by ferroelectric polarization in a non&#8208;volatile fashion. The perovskite artificial synapse emulates essential synaptic behavior, offering a route to utilize perovskites in neuromorphic devices.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites are distinctive semiconductors that exhibit both ionic and electronic transport and are promising for artificial synapses. However, developing a 3&#8208;terminal transistor artificial synapse with the perovskite channel remains elusive due to the lack of a proper technique to regulate mobile ions in a non&#8208;volatile manner. Here, a solution&#8208;processed perovskite transistor is reported for artificial synapses through the implementation of a ferroelectric gate. The ferroelectric polarization provides a non&#8208;volatile electric field on the perovskite, leading to fixation of the mobile ions and hence modulation of the electronic conductance of the channel. Multi&#8208;state channel conductance is realized by partial ferroelectric polarization. The ferroelectric&#8208;gated perovskite transistor is successfully used as an artificial synapse that emulates basic synaptic functions such as long&#8208;term plasticity with excellent linearity, short&#8208;term as well as spike&#8208;timing&#8208;dependent plasticity. The strategy to regulate ion dynamics in the perovskites using the ferroelectric gate suggests a generic route to employ perovskites for synaptic electronics.

         <title>Optimized Colossal Near&#8208;Field Thermal Radiation Enabled by Manipulating Coupled Plasmon Polariton Geometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coupled plasmon polaritons excited by gap&#8208;bridging multilayer graphene/SU8&#160;heterostructures lead to near&#8208;perfect photon&#8208;tunneling probability and improve the state of the art by one order of magnitude in near&#8208;field thermal radiation (NFTR). Electric tuning of graphene Fermi&#8208;level allows for optimized NFTR enhancement. Colossal energy transfer should inspire potential applications in thermophotovoltaic and so on.








Abstract
Collective optoelectronic phenomena such as plasmons and phonon polaritons can drive processes in many branches of nanoscale science. Classical physics predicts that a perfect thermal emitter operates at the black body limit. Numerous experiments have shown that surface phonon polaritons allow emission two orders of magnitude above the limit at a gap distance of &#8776;50&#160;nm. This work shows that a supported multilayer graphene structure improves the state of the art by around one order of magnitude with a &#8776;1129&#8208;fold&#8208;enhancement at a gap distance of &#8776;55&#160;nm. Coupled surface plasmon polaritons at mid&#8208; and far&#8208;infrared frequencies allow for near&#8208;unity photon tunneling across a broad swath of k&#8208;space enabling the improved result. Electric tuning of the Fermi&#8208;level allows for the detailed characterization and optimization of the colossal nanoscale heat transfer.

         <title>Loading Single&#8208;Ni Atoms on Assembled Hollow N&#8208;Rich Carbon Plates for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Assembled hollow N&#8208;rich carbon plates with single&#8208;Ni atoms (Ni&#8208;NC(AHP)) are constructed using a novel dual&#8208;linker zeolitic tetrazolate framework (ZTF) as precursor. The open structure and high external surface area enable the Ni&#8208;NC(AHP) catalyst with fast mass transfer and highly exposed single&#8208;Ni sites towards efficient CO2 electroreduction.








Abstract
The rational design of catalysts&#8217; spatial structure is vitally important to boost catalytic performance through exposing the active sites, enhancing the mass transfer, and confining the reactants. Herein, a dual&#8208;linker zeolitic tetrazolate framework&#8208;engaged strategy is developed to construct assembled hollow plates (AHP) of N&#8208;rich carbon (NC), which is loaded with single&#8208;Ni atoms to form a highly efficient electrocatalyst (designated as Ni&#8208;NC(AHP)). In the carbonization process, the thermally unstable linker (5&#8208;aminotetrazole) serves as the self&#8208;sacrificial template and the other linker (2&#8208;methylimidazole) mainly serves as the carbon and nitrogen source to form hollow NC matrix. The formed Ni&#8208;NC(AHP) catalyst possesses enhanced mesoporosity and more available surface area, thus promoting mass transport and affording abundant accessible single&#8208;Ni sites. These features contribute to remarkable performance for electrochemical CO2 reduction with exceptionally high selectivity of nearly 100% towards CO in a wide potential range and dramatically enhanced CO partial current density.

         <title>Elimination of Interfacial&#8208;Electrochemical&#8208;Reaction&#8208;Induced Polarization in Perovskite Single Crystals for Ultrasensitive and Stable X&#8208;Ray Detector Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing p&#8208; and n&#8208;type charge transport layers in the coplanar&#8208;structured perovskite X&#8208;ray detector to isolate the contact between the electrode and the perovskite, the interfacial electrochemical&#8208;reaction&#8208;induced polarization is effectively suppressed under large electric field up to 1000&#160;V cm&#8722;1, which results in the superior device performance with a low X&#8208;ray detection limit down to 0.1 nGyair s&#8722;1.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskites have exhibited bright prospects in high&#8208;sensitivity X&#8208;ray detection. However, they generally suffer from the severe field&#8208;driven polarization issue that remarkably deteriorates the detection performance. Here, it is demonstrated that the interfacial electrochemical reaction between Au electrodes and halogen in MAPbI3 single crystals (SCs) is the major source of the dark current polarization in the metal&#8211;semiconductor&#8211;metal (MSM)&#8208;structured perovskite X&#8208;ray detectors at the initial stage of biasing. By introducing the p&#8208; and n&#8208;type charge transport layers to isolate the electrodes from contacting the SC surface, the polarization is fully eliminated under a large electric field up to 1000&#160;V cm&#8722;1. Moreover, the resultant lateral p&#8211;i&#8211;n heterojunction suppresses the dark current of the devices by nearly 3 orders of magnitude as compared to the MSM counterparts and therefore enables a high sensitivity of 5.2 &#215; 106&#160;&#181;C Gy&#8722;1air cm&#8722;2 and a record low X&#8208;ray detection limit down to 0.1 nGyair s&#8722;1. The excellent biasing stability and sensitivity of the devices allow to prepare the linear detector arrays for X&#8208;ray imaging applications.

&lt;p&gt;By introducing p- and n-type charge transport layers in the coplanar-structured perovskite X-ray detector to isolate the contact between the electrode and the perovskite, the interfacial electrochemical-reaction-induced polarization is effectively suppressed under large electric field up to 1000&#160;V cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which results in the superior device performance with a low X-ray detection limit down to 0.1 nGy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Dense Silicon Nanowire Networks Grown on a Stainless&#8208;Steel Fiber Cloth: A Flexible and Robust Anode for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dense and tunable mass loading of Si NWs is directly grown on a highly conductive, flexible, fire&#8208;resistant, and mechanically robust interwoven stainless&#8208;steel fiber cloth (SSFC) by a simple and readily scalable glassware setup. Si NWs@SSFC anode with a mass loadings of 1.32&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 achieves a stable areal capacity of &#8776;2 mAh cm&#8722;2 after 200 cycles.








Abstract
Silicon nanowires (Si NWs) are a promising anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to their high specific capacity. Achieving adequate mass loadings for binder&#8208;free Si NWs is restricted by low surface area, mechanically unstable and poorly conductive current collectors (CCs), as well as complicated/expensive fabrication routes. Herein, a tunable mass loading and dense Si NW growth on a conductive, flexible, fire&#8208;resistant, and mechanically robust interwoven stainless&#8208;steel fiber cloth (SSFC) using a simple glassware setup is reported. The SSFC CC facilitates dense growth of Si NWs where its open structure allows a buffer space for expansion/contraction during Li&#8208;cycling. The Si NWs@SSFC anode displays a stable performance for 500 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of &gt;99.5%. Galvanostatic cycling of the Si NWs@SSFC anode with a mass loading of 1.32&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 achieves a stable areal capacity of &#8776;2 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 0.2 C after 200 cycles. Si NWs@SSFC anodes with different mass loadings are characterized before and after cycling by scanning and transmission electron microscopy to examine the effects of Li&#8208;cycling on the morphology. Notably, this approach allows the large&#8208;scale fabrication of robust and flexible binder&#8208;free Si NWs@SSFC architectures, making it viable for practical applications in high energy density LIBs.

         <title>Amine&#8208;Functionalized Carbon Nanodot Electrocatalysts Converting Carbon Dioxide to Methane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ amine functionalization is a general strategy that can be applied to nanoscale carbon catalysts, i.e., in the form of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) regardless of their crystal structure, to promote the selectivity and production rate of CH4 in CO2 electroreduction. Specifically, amine functionalized nitrogen&#8208;doped GQDs achieve CH4 Faradaic efficiency and partial current density of industrial relevance.








Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to methane (CH4), which can be used not only as fuel but also as a hydrogen carrier, has drawn great attention for use in supporting carbon capture and utilization. The design of active and selective electrocatalysts with exceptional CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion efficiency is highly desirable; however, it remains a challenge. Here a molecular tuning strategy&#8722;in situ amine functionalization of nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene quantum dots (GQDs) for highly efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion is presented. Amine functionalized nitrogen&#8208;doped GQDs achieve a CH4 Faradic efficiency (FE) of 63% and 46%, respectively, at CH4 partial current densities of 170 and 258&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, approximating to or even outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts. These GQDs also convert CO2 to C2 products mainly including C2H4 and C2H5OH with a maximum FE of &#8776;10%. A systematic analysis reveals that the CH4 yield varies linearly with amine group content, whereas the C2 production rate is positively dependent on pyridinic N dopant content. This work provides insight into the rational design of carbon catalysts with CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion efficiency at the industrially relevant level.
