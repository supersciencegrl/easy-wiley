         <title>Threshold Modulative Artificial GABAergic Nociceptor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Gamma&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a crucial inhibitory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system. It modifies the signal threshold of the nociceptor, allowing it to react to external stimuli in various circumstances. Thus, GABAergic behaviors are critical characteristics of the adaptive behavior in life. Here, we report a threshold&#8208;modulative artificial GABAergic nociceptor for the first time at a Pt/Ti/Nb2O5&#8211;x/Al2O3&#8208;y/Pt/Ti (top to bottom) of the double charge trapping structure. The Al2O3&#8208;y layer contains deep defect states that function similarly to the GABA neurotransmitter in modulating the signal threshold. Meanwhile, the Nb2O5&#8211;x layer traps volatile charges and produces nociceptive behaviors. The combined dynamics of the two layers readily offer threshold&#8208;modulative GABAergic nociceptive behaviors. Based on these GABAergic behaviors, we demonstrate a method of implementing hot&#8208; and cold&#8208;sensitive thermoreceptors and show its potential applications in advanced sensory devices.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks And Their Composites for Chronic Wound Healing: From Bench to Bedside</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Chronic wounds are characterized by delayed and dysregulated healing processes. As such, they have emerged as an increasingly significant threat. The associated morbidity and socioeconomic toll are clinically and financially challenging, necessitating novel approaches in the management of chronic wounds. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are an innovative type of porous coordination polymers, with low toxicity and high eco&#8208;friendliness. Documented anti&#8208;bacterial effects and pro&#8208;angiogenic activity predestine these nanomaterials as promising systems for the treatment of chronic wounds. In this context, the therapeutic applicability and efficacy of MOFs remain to be elucidated. We, therefore, review structural&#8208;functional properties of MOFs and their composite materials and discuss how their multifunctionality and customizability could be leveraged as a clinical therapy for chronic wounds.

         <title>Recent Advances and Opportunities of Eco&#8208;Friendly Ternary Copper Halides: A New Superstar in Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ternary copper halides (TCHs) have generated considerable attention for the exceptional structure diversity and fascinating optoelectronic properties. The recent advances of currently explored TCHs are systemically summarized, regarding the crystal and electronic structure, synthesis strategy, photophysical mechanism, luminescence regulation, environmental stability, and their emerging applications. Moreover, current existing challenges and possible development directions are proposed for their further development.








Abstract
Recently, the newly&#8208;emerging lead&#8208;free metal&#8208;halide materials with less toxicity and superior optoelectronic properties have received wide attention as the safer and potentially more robust alternatives to lead&#8208;based perovskite counterparts. Among them, ternary copper halides (TCHs) have become a vital group due to their unique features, including abundant structural diversity, ease of synthesis, unprecedented optoelectronic properties, high abundance, and low cost. Although the recent efforts in this field have made certain progresses, some scientific and technological issues still remain unresolved. Herein, a comprehensive and up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview of recent progress on the fundamental characteristics of TCH materials and their versatile applications is presented, which contains topics such as: i) crystal and electronic structure features and synthesis strategies; ii) mechanisms of self&#8208;trapped excitons, luminescence regulation, and environmental stability; and iii) their burgeoning optoelectronic devices of phosphor&#8208;converted white light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs), electroluminescent LEDs, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, X&#8208;ray scintillators, photodetectors, sensors, and memristors. Finally, the current challenges together with future perspectives on the development of TCH materials and applications are also critically described, which is considered to be critical for accelerating the commercialization of these rapidly evolving technologies.

         <title>J&#8208;Aggregation Strategy Toward Potentiated NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence Bioimaging of Molecular Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Molecular fluorophores emitting in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700 nm) window with strong optical harvesting and high quantum yields hold great potential for in vivo deep&#8208;tissue bioimaging and high&#8208;resolution biosensing. Recently, J&#8208;aggregates are harnessed to engineer long&#8208;wavelength NIR&#8208;II emitters and show unique superiority in tumor detection, vessel mapping, surgical navigation, and phototheranostics due to their bathochromic&#8208;shifted optical bands in the required slip&#8208;stacked arrangement aggregation state. However, despite the preliminary progress of NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates and theoretical study of structure&#8208;property relationships, further paradigms of NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates remain scarce due to the lack of study on aggregated fluorophores with slip&#8208;stacked fashion. In this effort, we emphatically elucidate how to utilize the specific molecular structure to form slip&#8208;stacked packing motifs with J&#8208;type aggregated exciton coupling. Firstly, several molecular regulating strategies to achieve NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates containing intermolecular interactions and external conditions are positively summarized and deeply analyzed. Then, the recent reports on J&#8208;aggregates for NIR&#8208;II bioimaging and theranostics are systematically summarized to provide a clear reference and direction for promoting the development of NIR&#8208;II organic fluorophores. Eventually, the prospective efforts on ameliorating and promoting NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates to further clinical practices are outlined.

         <title>Engineered Bio&#8208;Heterojunction Confers Extra&#8208; and Intracellular Bacterial Ferroptosis and Hunger&#8208;Triggered Cell Protection for Diabetic Wound Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanomaterial&#8208;mediated ferroptosis has garnered considerable interest in the antibacterial field, as it invokes the disequilibrium of ion homeostasis and boosts lipid peroxidation in extra&#8208; and intracellular bacteria. However, current ferroptosis&#8208;associated antibacterial strategies indiscriminately pose damage to healthy cells, ultimately compromising their biocompatibility. To address this daunting issue, we have designed a precise ferroptosis bio&#8208;heterojunction (F&#8208;bio&#8208;HJ) consisting of Fe2O3, Ti3C2&#8208;MXene, and glucose oxidase (GOx) to induce extra&#8208;intracellular bacteria&#8208;targeted ferroptosis for infected diabetic cutaneous regeneration. Fe2O3/Ti3C2&#8208;MXene@GOx (FMG) catalytically generates a considerable amount of ROS which assaults the membrane of extracellular bacteria, facilitating the permeation of synchronously generated Fe2+/Fe3+ into bacteria under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation, causing planktonic bacterial death via ferroptosis, Fe2+ overload, and lipid peroxidation. Additionally, FMG facilitates intracellular bacterial ferroptosis by transporting Fe2+ into intracellular bacteria via inward ferroportin (FPN). With GOx consuming glucose, FMG creates hunger protection which helps macrophages escape cell ferroptosis by activating the adenosine 5&#8216;&#8208;monophosphate (AMP)&#8208;activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. In vivo results authenticate that FMG boosts diabetic infectious cutaneous regeneration without triggering ferroptosis in normal cells. As envisaged, the proposed tactic provides a promising approach to combat intractable infections by precisely terminating extra&#8208;intracellular infection via steerable ferroptosis, thereby markedly elevating the biocompatibility of therapeutic ferroptosis&#8208;mediated strategies.

         <title>Ion Diode&#8208;like Heterojunction for Improving Electricity Generation from Water Droplets by Capillary Infiltration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Water&#8208;droplet&#8208;based electricity generators are emerging hydrovoltaic technologies that harvest energy from water circulation through strong interactions between water and nanomaterials. However, such devices exhibit poor current performance owing to their unclear driving force (evaporation or infiltration) and undesirable reverse diffusion current. Herein, a water&#8208;droplet&#8208;based hydrovoltaic electricity generator induced by capillary infiltration was fabricated with an asymmetric structure composed of a diode&#8208;like heterojunction formed by negatively and positively charged materials. This device generated current densities of 160 and 450&#160;&#956;A cm&#8722;2 at room temperature and 65&#176;C, respectively. The heterojunction achieved a rectification ratio of 12, which effectively suppressed the reverse current caused by concentration differences. This resulted in improved charge accumulation of approximately 60 mC cm&#8722;2 in 1000 s, which was three times the value observed in the control device. When the area of the device was increased to 6 cm2, the current increased linearly to 1&#160;mA, thus demonstrating the scale&#8208;up potential of the generator. The driving force of the streaming potential is primarily capillary infiltration, and rectification had not been previously observed. The proposed method of constructing ion&#8208;diode&#8208;like structures provides a new strategy for improving generator performance.

         <title>Efficient Surfactant&#8208;Mediated Photovoltaic Manipulation of Fl&#8208;Scale Aqueous Microdroplets for Diverse Optofluidic Applications on LiNbO3 Platform</title>

Abstract
The electrodeless biocompatible manipulation of femtoliter&#8208;scale aqueous microdroplets remains challenging to date. The appropriate isolation of electrostatic charges from fL&#8208;scale aqueous microdroplets is crucial for electrodeless optoelectronic manipulation based on space&#8208;charge&#8208;density modulation. Here, we propose surfactant&#8208;mediated photovoltaic manipulation, in which the surfactant layers self&#8208;assembled at the water&#8208;oil and oil&#8208;LN interfaces are employed to isolate photovoltaic charges. The reduced electrostatic attenuation, remarkable hydrophobicity, and strong electrical breakdown suppression of the surfactant layers enable the stable and swift manipulation of fL&#8208;scale aqueous microdroplets using &#956;W&#8208;level laser in an oil medium. By virtue of the surfactant&#8208;mediated photovoltaic manipulation, we realized a controllable merging/touching/detaching switch of aqueous microdroplets by adjusting the laser illumination intensity and position and demonstrated the cascading biochemical operations and microreactions of aqueous microdroplets and microdroplet strings. To demonstrate its potential in photonic MEMS assemblies, we demonstrated the end coupling of a tightly focused&#8208;laser&#8208;beam into a ZnO microrod leveraging the refraction effect occurring at the water/oil interface. Moreover, because of the selective permeability of the droplet&#8208;interface&#8208;bilayer developed between the touching microdroplets, we achieved in situ adjustment of the size of the microdroplets and the fluorescent solute contained in the microdroplets, aiming at constructing multicomponent fluorescent microdroplets with tunable whispering&#8208;gallery&#8208;mode (WGM) characteristics.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis and Excited&#8208;State Dynamics of Null Exciton&#8208;Coupled Diketopyrrolopyrroles Oligo&#8208;Grids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent diketopyrrolopyrrole dimer [2]Grid and trimer [3]Grid with cyclic rigid structures are synthesized via one&#8208;pot Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction. They both display null exciton couplings and solvent&#8208;dependent excited&#8208;state dynamics. In toluene, they exhibit monomer&#8208;like photophysical properties. However, in benzonitrile, especially [2]Grid forms the symmetry&#8208;broken charge&#8208;separated state faster and more efficiently, which further recombines to generate the triplet excited state.








Abstract
Exciton coupling in molecular aggregates plays a vital role in impacting and fine&#8208;tuning optoelectronic materials and their efficiencies in devices. A versatile platform to decipher aggregation&#8208;property relationships is built around multichromophoric architectures. Here, a series of cyclic diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) oligomers featuring nanoscale gridarene structures and rigid bifluorenyl spacers are designed and synthesized via one&#8208;pot Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction. DPP dimer [2]Grid and trimer [3]Grid, which are cyclic rigid nanoarchitectures of rather different sizes, are further characterized via steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies. They exhibit monomer&#8208;like spectroscopic signatures in the steady&#8208;state measurements, from which null exciton couplings are derived. Moreover, in an apolar solvent, high fluorescence quantum yields and excited&#8208;state dynamics that resembled DPP monomer are gathered. In a polar solvent, the localized singlet excited state on a single DPP dissociates into the adjacent null coupling DPP with charge transfer characteristics. This pathway facilitates the evolution of&#160;the symmetry&#8208;broken charge&#8208;separated state (SB&#8208;CS). Notable is the fact that the SB&#8208;CS of [2]Grid is, on one hand, in equilibrium with the singlet excited state and promotes, on the other hand, the formation of the triplet excited state with a yield of 32% via charge recombination.

         <title>Understanding and Suppressing Non&#8208;Radiative Recombination Losses in Non&#8208;Fullerene Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Minimizing non&#8208;radiative recombination losses in the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art non&#8208;fullerene solar cells is of utmost importance in order to achieve power conversion efficiencies over 20% in the future. This review discusses methods to accurately quantify non&#8208;radiative voltage losses as well as the current understanding of their origin and empirical strategies for reducing them.








Abstract
Organic solar cells benefit from non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFA) due to their high absorption coefficients, tunable frontier energy levels, and optical gaps, as well as their relatively high luminescence quantum efficiencies as compared to fullerenes. Those merits result in high yields of charge generation at a low or negligible energetic offset at the donor/NFA heterojunction, with efficiencies over 19% achieved for single&#8208;junction devices. Pushing this value significantly over 20% requires an increase in open&#8208;circuit voltage, which is currently still well below the thermodynamic limit. This can only be achieved by reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination, and hereby increasing the electroluminescence quantum efficiency of the photo&#8208;active layer. Here, current understanding of the origin of non&#8208;radiative decay, as well as an accurate quantification of the associated voltage losses are summarized. Promising strategies for suppressing these losses are highlighted, with focus on new material design, optimization of donor&#8211;acceptor combination, and blend morphology. This review aims at guiding researchers in their quest to find future solar harvesting donor&#8211;acceptor blends, which combine a high yield of exciton dissociation with a high yield of radiative free carrier recombination and low voltage losses, hereby closing the efficiency gap with inorganic and perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>A Hyperspectral Camouflage Colorant Inspired by Natural Leaves</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The unmet spectral mimicry of foliar green in camouflage materials has been hampered by the lack of colorants with similar spectral properties to chlorophyll, resulting in substantial risks of exposure from hyperspectral target detection. By drawing inspiration from leaf chromogenesis, a microcapsule colorant with a chloroplast&#8208;like structure and chlorophyll&#8208;like absorption is developed, and a generic bilayer coating is designed to provide high spectral similarity to leaves with different growth stages, seasons and species. Specifically, the microcapsule colorant preserves the monomeric absorption of the internal phthalocyanine and features the manufacturability of conventional pigments, such as amenability to painting and patterning, and compatibility to different substrates. The pigmented artificial leaves successfully deceive the hyperspectral classification algorithm in a foliar background, and outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;art spectral simulation materials. This coloration strategy expands the knowledge base of the spectral fine tuning of composite colorants, which are essential for their application in spectral&#8208;resolved optical materials.

         <title>Embedded Host/Guest Alloy Aggregations Enable High&#8208;Performance Ternary Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ternary strategy has been intensively studied to improve the power conversion efficiencies of organic photovoltaics. Thereinto, the location of the guest component plays a critical role, but few reports have devoted to this concern. Hereon, we disclose the distribution of LA1 as guest acceptor in varieties of ternary scenarios, and outline the dominating driving forces of managing the guest distribution and operating modes. Governed by appropriate relationship of compatibility, crystallinity, and surface energies between host and guest acceptors, as well as interfacial interactions between donor and dual acceptors, most of the LA1 molecules permeate into the internal of host acceptor phases, forming embedded host/guest alloy&#8208;like aggregations. The characteristic distributions greatly optimize the morphologies, maximize energy transfer, and enhance exciton/charge behaviors. Particularly, PM6:IT&#8208;4F:LA1 ternary cells afford high efficiency of 15.27% with impressive fill factors (FF) over 81%. The popularization studies further verify the superiority of the LA1&#8208;involved alloy structures, and with Y6&#8208;family acceptor as host component, an outstanding efficiency of 19.17% was received. The results highlight the importance of guest distribution in ternary systems, and shed light on the governing factors of distributing the guests in ternary cells.

         <title>An On&#8208;Demand Collaborative Innate&#8208;Adaptive Immune Response to Infection Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Deep tissue infection is a common clinical issue and therapeutic difficulty caused by the disruption of the host antibacterial immune function, resulting in treatment failure and infection relapse. Intracellular pathogens are refractory to elimination and can manipulate host cell biology even after appropriate treatment, resulting in a locoregional immunosuppressive state that leads to an inadequate response to conventional anti&#8208;infective therapies. Here, we report a novel antibacterial strategy involving autogenous immunity using a biomimetic nanoparticle (NP)&#8208;based regulating system to induce in&#8208;situ collaborative innate&#8208;adaptive immune responses. We observed that a macrophage membrane coating facilitated NP enrichment at the infection site, followed by active NP accumulation in macrophages in a mannose&#8208;dependent manner. These NP&#8208;armed macrophages exhibited considerably improved innate capabilities, including more efficient intracellular ROS generation and pro&#8208;inflammatory factor secretion, M1 phenotype promotion, and effective eradication of invasive bacteria. Furthermore, the reprogrammed macrophages directed T cell activation at infectious sites, resulting in a robust adaptive antimicrobial immune response to ultimately achieve bacterial clearance and prevent infection relapse. Overall, these results provide a conceptual framework for a novel macrophage&#8208;based strategy for infection treatment via regulation of autogenous immunity.

         <title>A Breakthrough in Solution&#8208;Processed Ultra&#8208;Deep&#8208;Blue HLCT&#8208;OLEDs: A Record External Quantum Efficiency Exceeding 10% based on Novel V&#8208;Shaped Emitters</title>

Abstract
It has always been a great challenge to achieve high&#8208;efficiency solution&#8208;processed ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) 1931 chromaticity coordinates matching the blue primary of Rec. ITU&#8208;R BT.2100, which specifies high dynamic range television (HDR&#8208;TV) image parameters. Inspired by hybrid local and charge transfer (HLCT) excited state emitters improving exciton utilization through high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem system crossing, a series of high&#8208;performance blue emitters by a V&#8208;shaped symmetric D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D design strategy are developed in this study. Here, the large torsions and unstable bonds of D&#8208;A structures could be improved through &#960; bridges, and also the conjugation length and donor groups can be easily adjusted. The obtained emitters merit excellent photophysical and electrochemical properties, thermal stability, solution processibility, and HLCT excited state excellence. Results suggest that the OLEDs based on the obtained blue emitters all achieve high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of more than 8% with very low efficiency roll&#8208;off. In particular, the device based on FIP&#8208;CZ exhibits a satisfactory ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue emission (CIEx,y = 0.1579, 0.0387) and a record&#8208;high EQEmax (10.40%) among solution&#8208;processed HLCT&#8208;OLEDs, which is very close to the record EQEmax of devices by vacuum vapor deposition technology.

         <title>Stacking&#8208;Controlled Growth of rBN Crystalline Films with High Nonlinear Optical Conversion Efficiency up to 1%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Nonlinear optical crystals lie at the core of ultrafast laser science and quantum communication technology. The emergence of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials provides a revolutionary potential for nonlinear optical crystals due to their exceptionally high nonlinear coefficients. However, uncontrolled stacking orders generally induce the destructive nonlinear response due to the optical phase deviation in different 2D layers. Therefore, conversion efficiency of 2D nonlinear crystals is typically limited to less than 0.01% (far below the practical criterion of &gt;1%). Here, we controllably synthesize crystalline films of rhombohedral boron nitride (rBN) with parallel stacked layers. This success is realized by the utilization of vicinal FeNi (111) single crystal, where both the unidirectional arrangement of BN grains into a single&#8208;crystal monolayer and the continuous precipitation of (B, N) source for thick layers are guaranteed. The preserved in&#8208;plane inversion asymmetry in rBN films keeps the in&#8208;phase second harmonic generation field in every layer and leads to a record&#8208;high conversion efficiency of 1% in the whole family of 2D materials within the coherence thickness of only 1.6&#160;&#956;m. Our work provides a route for designing ultrathin nonlinear optical crystals from 2D materials, and will promote the on&#8208;demand fabrication of integrated photonic and compact quantum optical devices.

         <title>Pyrochlore&#8208;Type Iron Hydroxy Fluorides as Low&#8208;Cost Lithium&#8208;Ion Cathode Materials for Stationary Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Pyrochlore&#8208;type iron (III) hydroxy fluorides (Pyr&#8208;IHF) are appealing low&#8208;cost stationary energy storage materials due to the virtually unlimited supply of their constituent elements, their high energy densities and fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion. However, the prohibitively high cost of synthesis and cathode architecture currently prevent their commercial use in low&#8208;cost Li&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, we present a facile and cost&#8208;effective dissolution&#8208;precipitation synthesis of Pyr&#8208;IHF from soluble iron (III) fluoride precursors. High capacity retention by synthesized Pyr&#8208;IHF of &gt; 80% after 600&#160;cycles at a high current density of 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8208;1 was obtained, without elaborate electrode engineering. Operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction guided the selective synthesis of Pyr&#8208;IHF such that different water contents could be tested for their effect on the rate capability. Li&#8208;ion diffusion was found to occur in the 3D hexagonal channels of Pyr&#8208;IHF, formed by corner&#8208;sharing FeF6&#8208;x(OH)x octahedra.

         <title>PD&#8208;L1 Antibody&#8208;Conjugated PAMAM Dendrimer Nanosystem for Simultaneously Inhibiting Glycolysis and Promoting Immune Response in Fighting Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy affecting women, yet current therapeutic strategies remain ineffective for patients with late&#8208;stage or metastatic disease. We report here an effective strategy for treating metastatic breast cancer. Specifically, we established a self&#8208;assembling dendrimer nanosystem decorated with an anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody for delivering a small interfering RNA (siRNA) to target PDK1, a protein kinase involved in cancer metabolism and metastasis. This nanosystem (named PPD) was designed to target PD&#8208;L1 for cancer specific delivery of the siRNA to inhibit PDK1 (named siPDK1) and modulate cancer metabolism while promoting PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 pathway&#8208;based immunotherapy. Indeed, PPD effectively protected siPDK1 from degradation and supported its specific delivery to cancer cells for downregulating PDK1 expression. This resulted in simultaneous inhibition of PDK1&#8208;induced glycolysis and the PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 pathway&#8208;related immune response, leading to potent inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis without any notable toxicity in tumor&#8208;bearing mouse models. Collectively, these results highlight the potential use of PPD as an effective and safe tumor&#8208;targeting therapy for breast cancer. This study constitutes a successful proof of principle exploiting the intrinsic features of tumor microenvironment and metabolism alongside unique self&#8208;assembling dendrimer platform to achieve specific tumor targeting and siRNA&#8208;based gene silencing in combined and precision cancer therapy.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy affecting women, yet current therapeutic strategies remain ineffective for patients with late-stage or metastatic disease. We report here an effective strategy for treating metastatic breast cancer. Specifically, we established a self-assembling dendrimer nanosystem decorated with an anti-PD-L1 antibody for delivering a small interfering RNA (siRNA) to target PDK1, a protein kinase involved in cancer metabolism and metastasis. This nanosystem (named PPD) was designed to target PD-L1 for cancer specific delivery of the siRNA to inhibit PDK1 (named siPDK1) and modulate cancer metabolism while promoting PD-1/PD-L1 pathway-based immunotherapy. Indeed, PPD effectively protected siPDK1 from degradation and supported its specific delivery to cancer cells for downregulating PDK1 expression. This resulted in simultaneous inhibition of PDK1-induced glycolysis and the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway-related immune response, leading to potent inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis without any notable toxicity in tumor-bearing mouse models. Collectively, these results highlight the potential use of PPD as an effective and safe tumor-targeting therapy for breast cancer. This study constitutes a successful proof of principle exploiting the intrinsic features of tumor microenvironment and metabolism alongside unique self-assembling dendrimer platform to achieve specific tumor targeting and siRNA-based gene silencing in combined and precision cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>In Situ Covalent Reinforcement of a Benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;Tricarboxamide Supramolecular Polymer Enables Biomimetic, Tough, and Fibrous Hydrogels and Bioinks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Creating fibrillar yet tough synthetic hydrogel and bioink remains highly desired. Inspired by collagen's covalent cross&#8208;linking of fibrils; herein, a benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) based synthetic supramolecular/covalent strategy is reported for creating a tough hydrogel and bioink. The bioink enables 3D bioprinting of hMSCs spheroids and supports cartilage&#8208;like tissue formation within the hydrogel.








Abstract
Synthetic hydrogels often lack the load&#8208;bearing capacity and mechanical properties of native biopolymers found in tissue, such as cartilage. In natural tissues, toughness is often imparted via the combination of fibrous noncovalent self&#8208;assembly with key covalent bond formation. This controlled combination of supramolecular and covalent interactions remains difficult to engineer, yet can provide a clear strategy for advanced biomaterials. Here, a synthetic supramolecular/covalent strategy is investigated for creating a tough hydrogel that embodies the hierarchical fibrous architecture of the extracellular matrix (ECM). A benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) hydrogelator is developed with synthetically addressable norbornene handles that self&#8208;assembles to form a and viscoelastic hydrogel. Inspired by collagen's covalent cross&#8208;linking of fibrils, the mechanical properties are reinforced by covalent intra&#8208; and interfiber cross&#8208;links. At over 90% water, the hydrogels withstand up to 550% tensile strain, 90% compressive strain, and dissipated energy with recoverable hysteresis. The hydrogels are shear&#8208;thinning, can be 3D bioprinted with good shape fidelity, and can be toughened via&#160;covalent cross&#8208;linking. These materials enable the bioprinting of human mesenchymal stromal cell (hMSC) spheroids and subsequent differentiation into chondrogenic tissue. Collectively, these findings highlight the power of covalent reinforcement&#160;of supramolecular fibers, offering a strategy for the bottom&#8208;up design of dynamic, yet tough, hydrogels and bioinks.

         <title>4D Additive&#8211;Subtractive Manufacturing of Shape Memory Ceramics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient, precise, and scalable four&#8208;dimensional (4D)&#160;additive&#8211;subtractive manufacturing paradigm for ceramics with multimode shape memory capabilities is developed. The balance between thermal expansion and shrinkage is the mechanism for ceramic 4D printing. A high flame ablation performance of complex&#8208;shaped ceramics is achieved with Al2O3&#8208;deposited SiOC&#8208;based nanocrystalline&#8208;amorphous dual&#8208;phase ceramic lattice structures.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;temperature structural materials, such as ceramics, is limited by their extremely high melting points and the difficulty in building complicated architectures. Four&#8208;dimensional (4D) printing helps enhance the geometrical flexibility of ceramics. However, ceramic 4D printing systems are limited by the separate processes for shape and material transformations, low accuracy of morphing systems, low resolution of ceramic structures, and their time&#8208;intensive nature. Here, a paradigm for a one&#8208;step shape/material transformation, high&#8208;2D/3D/4D&#8208;precision, high&#8208;efficiency, and scalable 4D additive&#8211;subtractive manufacturing of shape memory ceramics is developed. Original/reverse and global/local multimode shape memory capabilities are achieved using macroscale SiOC&#8208;based ceramic materials. The uniformly deposited Al2O3&#8208;rich layer on the printed SiOC&#8208;based ceramic lattice structures results in an unusually high flame ablation performance of the complex&#8208;shaped ceramics. The proposed framework is expected to broaden the applications of high&#8208;temperature structural materials in the aerospace, electronics, biomedical, and art fields.

         <title>Ultralow&#8208;Dielectric&#8208;Constant Atomic Layers of Amorphous Carbon Nitride Topologically Derived from MXene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic layers of amorphous carbon nitride (a&#8208;CN) are produced via topological conversion of MXene&#8208;Ti3CNTx under bromine vapor. The resultant a&#8208;CN layers possess a low density of 0.55 g cm&#8722;3 and a high sp3 C level of 35.7%. As a result, a very low dielectric constant of 1.69 at 100 kHz is achieved for the 310&#8208;nm&#8208;thickness a&#8208;CN film with a breakdown strength of 5.6 MV cm&#8722;1.








Abstract
Low&#8208;dielectric&#8208;constant materials such as silicon dioxide serving as interconnect insulators in current integrated circuit face a great challenge due to their relatively high dielectric constant of &#8776;4, twice that of the recommended value by the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems, causing severe parasitic capacitance and associated response delay. Here, novel atomic layers of amorphous carbon nitride (a&#8208;CN) are prepared via a topological conversion of MXene&#8208;Ti3CNTx under bromine vapor. Remarkably, the assembled a&#8208;CN film exhibits an ultralow dielectric constant of 1.69 at 100 kHz, much lower than the previously reported dielectric materials such as amorphous carbon (2.2) and fluorinated&#8208;doped SiO2 (3.6), ascribed to the low density of 0.55&#160;g cm&#8722;3 and high sp3 C level of 35.7%. Moreover, the a&#8208;CN film has a breakdown strength of 5.6 MV&#160;cm&#8722;1, showing great potential in integrated circuit application.

         <title>Shaping Synthetic Multicellular and Complex Multimaterial Tissues via Embedded Extrusion&#8208;Volumetric Printing of Microgels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The convergence of extrusion&#8208;based and volumetric bioprinting, with microgels as platform materials, provides the possibility to create complex structures on a cm3&#8208;scale in a fast and accurate manner. By leveraging the versatility of this platform, it is possible to introduce multi&#8208;material and multi&#8208;cellular features in user defined&#8208;architectures.








Abstract
In living tissues, cells express their functions following complex signals from their surrounding microenvironment. Capturing both hierarchical architectures at the micro&#8208; and macroscale, and anisotropic cell patterning remains a major challenge in bioprinting, and a bottleneck toward creating physiologically&#8208;relevant models. Addressing this limitation, a novel technique is introduced, termed Embedded Extrusion&#8208;Volumetric Printing (EmVP), converging extrusion&#8208;bioprinting and layer&#8208;less, ultra&#8208;fast volumetric bioprinting, allowing spatially pattern multiple inks/cell types. Light&#8208;responsive microgels are developed for the first time as bioresins (&#181;Resins) for light&#8208;based volumetric bioprinting, providing a microporous environment permissive for cell homing and self&#8208;organization. Tuning the mechanical and optical properties of gelatin&#8208;based microparticles enables their use as support bath for suspended extrusion printing, in which features containing high cell densities can be easily introduced. &#181;Resins can be sculpted within seconds with tomographic light projections into centimeter&#8208;scale, granular hydrogel&#8208;based, convoluted constructs. Interstitial microvoids enhanced differentiation of multiple stem/progenitor cells (vascular, mesenchymal, neural), otherwise not possible with conventional bulk hydrogels. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, EmVP is applied to create complex synthetic biology&#8208;inspired intercellular communication models, where adipocyte differentiation is regulated by optogenetic&#8208;engineered pancreatic cells. Overall, EmVP offers new avenues for producing regenerative grafts with biological functionality, and for developing engineered living systems and (metabolic) disease models.

         <title>Short Peptide Nanofiber Biomaterials Ameliorate Local Hemostatic Capacity of Surgical Materials and Intraoperative Hemostatic Applications in Clinics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Short peptide nanofiber biomaterials are an intriguing surgical tool to serve as functional hemostatic devices and have claimed more and more advantages over traditional biomaterials and formulations. The comparable aspects in surgical applications, hemostatic mechnism, and emerging medical devices are addressed comprehensively in multiple surgical specialties.








Abstract
Short designer self&#8208;assembling peptide (dSAP) biomaterials are a new addition to the hemostat group. It may provide a diverse and robust toolbox for surgeons to integrate wound microenvironment with much safer and stronger hemostatic capacity than conventional materials and hemostatic agents. Especially in noncompressible torso hemorrhage (NCTH), diffuse mucosal surface bleeding, and internal medical bleeding (IMB), with respect to the optimal hemostatic formulation, dSAP biomaterials are the ingenious nanofiber alternatives to make bioactive neural scaffold, nasal packing, large mucosal surface coverage in gastrointestinal surgery (esophagus, gastric lesion, duodenum, and lower digestive tract), epicardiac cell&#8208;delivery carrier, transparent matrix barrier, and so on. Herein, in multiple surgical specialties, dSAP&#8208;biomaterial&#8208;based nano&#8208;hemostats achieve safe, effective, and immediate hemostasis, facile wound healing, and potentially reduce the risks in delayed bleeding, rebleeding, post&#8208;operative bleeding, or related complications. The biosafety in vivo, bleeding indications, tissue&#8208;sealing quality, surgical feasibility, and local usability are addressed comprehensively and sequentially and pursued to develop useful surgical techniques with better hemostatic performance. Here, the state of the art and all&#8208;round advancements of nano&#8208;hemostatic approaches in surgery are provided. Relevant critical insights will inspire exciting investigations on peptide nanotechnology, next&#8208;generation biomaterials, and better promising prospects in clinics.

         <title>A Rapid Self&#8208;Pumping Organohydrogel Dressing with Hydrophilic Fractal Microchannels to Promote Burn Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid self&#8208;pumping organohydrogel with hydrophilic fractal hydrogel microchannels by a dynamic floating&#8208;colliding&#8208;coalescing process is prepared, realizing &#8776;30 times enhancement in draining water than pure hydrogel. The rapid self&#8208;pumping organohydrogel dressing can accelerate burn wound healing by reducing dermal cavity (&#8776;42.5%), accelerating hair follicles (&#8776;13.5 times) and blood vessels (&#8776;6.6 times) regeneration.








Abstract
Burn wounds pose great challenges for conventional dressings because massive exudates oversecreted from swollen tissues and blisters seriously delay wound healing. Herein, a self&#8208;pumping organohydrogel dressing with hydrophilic fractal microchannels is reported that can rapidly drain excessive exudates with &#8776;30 times enhancement in efficiency compared with the pure hydrogel, and effectively promote burn wound healing. A creaming&#8208;assistant emulsion interfacial polymerization approach is proposed to create the hydrophilic fractal hydrogel microchannels in the self&#8208;pumping organohydrogel through a dynamic floating&#8208;colliding&#8208;coalescing process of organogel precursor droplets. In a murine burn wound model, the rapid self&#8208;pumping organohydrogel dressings can markedly reduce dermal cavity by &#8776;42.5%, accelerate blood vessel regeneration by &#8776;6.6 times, and hair follicle regeneration by &#8776;13.5 times, compared with the commercial dressing (Tegaderm). This study paves an avenue for designing high&#8208;performance functional burn wound dressings.

         <title>Photoelectron &#8220;Bridge&#8221; in Van Der Waals Heterojunction for Enhanced Photocatalytic CO2 Conversion Under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Van der Waals heterojunctions as photocatalysts by traditional wet chemical methods encounter the challengeof charge transfer, because of steric hindrance and barriers caused by a large interfacial spacing. Introducing phosphoric acid molecules at the heterojunction interface acts as an electron "bridge" to eliminate the interfacial potential difference and create a photoelectron transport channel to promote the photocatalytic reaction.








Abstract
Constructing Van der Waals heterojunction is a crucial strategy to achieve excellent photocatalytic activity. However, in most Van der Waals heterojunctions synthesized by ex situ assembly, electron transfer encounters huge hindrances at the interface between the two components due to the large spacing and potential barrier. Herein, a phosphate&#8208;bridged Van der Waals heterojunction of cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc)/tungsten disulfide (WS2) bridged by phosphate (xCoPc&#8208;nPO4&#8722;&#8208;WS2) is designed and prepared by the traditional wet chemistry method. By introducing a small phosphate molecule into the interface of CoPc and WS2, creates an electron &#8220;bridge&#8221;, resulting in a compact combination and eliminating the space barrier. Therefore, the phosphate (PO4&#8722;) bridge can serve as an efficient electron transfer channel in heterojunction and can efficiently transmit photoelectrons from WS2 to CoPc under excited states. These excited photoelectrons are captured by the catalytic central Co2+ in CoPc and subsequently convert CO2 molecules into CO and CH4 products, achieving&#160;17&#8208;fold enhancement on the 3CoPc&#8208;0.6PO4&#8722;&#8208;WS2 sample compared to that of pure WS2. Introducing a small molecule &#8220;bridge&#8221; to create an electron transfer channel provides a new perspective in designing efficient photocatalysts for photocatalytic CO2 reduction into valuable products.

         <title>Printable High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable FAPbBr3 Perovskite Solar Cells for Multifunctional Building&#8208;Integrated Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ intermediate phase transition&#8208;controlled blade&#8208;coating method for FAPbBr3 perovskite solar cells is introduced, which obtains a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.86% based on hole transport layer&#8208;free structures of glass/FTO/SnO2/FAPbBr3/carbon. Semitransparent devices are fabricated and obtain high PCE of 8.61% at average visible light transmittance (AVT) =&#160;45% and PCE of 5.55% at AVT&#160;=&#160;53% for small devices and 10&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#160;cm2 modules, respectively.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) show great promise for next&#8208;generation building&#8208;integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) applications because of their abundance of raw materials, adjustable transparency, and cost&#8208;effective printable processing. Owing to the complex perovskite nucleation and growth control, the fabrication of large&#8208;area perovskite films for high&#8208;performance printed PSCs is still under active investigation. Herein, the study proposes an intermediate&#8208;phase&#8208;transition&#8208;assisted one&#8208;step blade coating for an intrinsic transparent formamidinium lead bromide (FAPbBr3) perovskite film. The intermediate complex optimizes the crystal growth path of FAPbBr3, resulting in a large&#8208;area, homogeneous, and dense absorber film. A champion efficiency of 10.86% with high open&#8208;circuit voltage up to 1.57&#160;V is obtained with a simplified device architecture of glass/FTO/SnO2/FAPbBr3/carbon. Moreover, the unencapsulated devices maintain 90% of their initial power conversion efficiency after aging at 75&#160;&#176;C for 1000&#160;h in ambient air, and 96% after maximum power point tracking for 500&#160;h. The printed semitransparent PSCs, with average visible light transmittance over 45%, demonstrate high efficiencies for both small devices (8.6%) and 10&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#160;cm2 modules (5.55%). Finally, the ability to customize the color, transparency, and thermal insulation properties of FAPbBr3 PSCs makes them high prospects as multifunctional BIPVs.

Two acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor&#8242;&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor type organic emitters named NTQ and BTQ with narrow optical gaps of 1.23 and 1.13 eV are employed as short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) applications. The resultant SWIR OLEDs based on NTQ show good SWIR radiation properties, with a maximal radiant exitance of 1.12 mW cm&#8208;2 at 1140 nm, one of the highest values for OLEDs emitting at SWIR region.








Abstract
Short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) have attracted great interest due to their potential applications in biological imaging, infrared lighting, optical communication, environmental monitoring, and surveillance. Due to an intrinsic limitation posed by the energy&#8208;gap law, achieving high&#8208;brightness in SWIR OLEDs remains a challenge. Herein, the study reports the use of novel A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8242;&#8211;D&#8211;A type small molecules NTQ and BTQ for high&#8208;performance SWIR OLEDs. Benefiting from multiple D&#8211;A effect in conjugated skeleton, the small molecules NTQ and BTQ exhibit narrow optical gaps of 1.23 and 1.13&#160;eV, respectively. SWIR electroluminescence (EL) emission from OLEDs based on NTQ and BTQ is achieved, with emission peaks at 1140 and 1175&#160;nm, respectively. Not only owing to a negligible efficiency roll&#8208;off across the full range of applied current density but also the ability to afford a high operation current density of 5200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, the resultant SWIR OLEDs based on NTQ exhibit a maximal radiant exitance of =1.12&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the NTQ&#8208;based OLEDs also possess sub&#8208;gap turn&#8208;on voltage of 0.85&#160;V, which is close to the physical limits derived from the generalized Kirchhoff and Planck equation. This work demonstrates that A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8242;&#8211;D&#8211;A type small molecules offer significant promise for NIR/SWIR emitting material innovations.

         <title>NbTe4 Phase&#8208;Change Material: Breaking the Phase&#8208;Change Temperature Balance in 2D Van der Waals Transition&#8208;Metal Binary Chalcogenide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study explores chalcogen&#8208;rich 2D transition&#8208;metal (TM)&#8208;chalcogenides' potential for phase&#8208;change memory. The focus is on the layered TM&#8208;chalcogenide NbTe4, showing a lower melting point and higher crystallization temperature than traditional phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) such as Ge2Sb2Te5. Further device evaluation demonstrates that NbTe4 is an excellent solution for current PCM issueslike poor thermal stability and the high Reset energy.








Abstract
2D van der Waals (vdW) transition metal di&#8208;chalcogenides (TMDs) have garnered significant attention in the nonvolatile memory field for their tunable electrical properties, scalability, and potential for phase engineering. However, their complex switching mechanism and complicated fabrication methods pose challenges for mass production. Sputtering is a promising technique for large&#8208;area 2D vdW TMD fabrication, but the high melting point (typically Tm &gt; 1000 &#176;C) of TMDs requires elevated temperatures for good crystallinity. This study focuses on the low&#8208;Tm 2D vdW TM tetra&#8208;chalcogenides and identifies NbTe4 as a promising candidate with an ultra&#8208;low Tm of around 447 &#176;C (onset temperature). As&#8208;grown NbTe4 forms an amorphous phase upon deposition that can be crystallized by annealing at temperatures above 272 &#176;C. The simultaneous presence of a low Tm and a high crystallization temperature Tc can resolve important issues facing current phase&#8208;change memory compounds, such as high Reset energies and poor thermal stability of the amorphous phase. Therefore, NbTe4 holds great promise as a potential solution to these issues.

         <title>Robust and Sustainable Indium Anode Leading to Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable approach for recycling non&#8208;sustainable indium to construct efficient and stable OSCs and scale&#8208;up modules is developed, achieving the impressive PCE of 18.92% and 15.20%, respectively.

Abstract
The fast degradation of the charge&#8208;extraction interface at indium tin oxide (ITO) poses a significant obstacle to achieving long&#8208;term stability for organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, a sustainable approach for recycling non&#8208;sustainable indium to construct efficient and stable OSCs and scale&#8208;up modules is developed. It is revealed that the recovered indium chloride (InCl3) from indium oxide waste can be applied as an effective hole&#8208;selective interfacial layer for the ITO electrode (noted as InCl3&#8211;ITO anode) through simple aqueous fabrication, facilitating not only energy level alignment to photoactive blends but also mitigating parasitic absorption and charge recombination losses of the corresponding OSCs. As a result, OSCs and modules consisting of InCl3&#8211;ITO anodes achieve remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 18.92% and 15.20% (active area of 18.73 cm2), respectively. More importantly, the InCl3&#8211;ITO anode can significantly extend the thermal stability of derived OSCs, with an extrapolated T80 lifetime of &#8776;10&#160;000 h.

         <title>Exotic Electronic Properties of 2D Nanosheets Isolated from Liquid Phase Exfoliated Phyllosilicate Minerals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation is applied to common layered phyllosilicate crystals of mica and chlorite schist to fabricate high&#8208;yield nanosheet suspensions. Once commonly believed to be spectrally inactive, electrically insulating, and chemically inert, suspensions of micene and chlorene nanosheets are shown to have unique spectral fingerprints, tuneable bandgaps, and superlative electrochemical performances for the hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Spectrally inactive, electrically insulating, and chemically inert are adjectives broadly used to describe phyllosilicate minerals like mica and chlorite. Here, the above is disproved by demonstrating aqueous suspensions of liquid exfoliated nanosheets from five bulk mica types and chlorite schist. Nanosheet quality is confirmed via transmission electron and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopies, as well as electron diffraction. Through Raman spectroscopy, a previously unreported size&#8208; and layer&#8208;dependent spectral fingerprint is observed. When analyzing the high&#8208;yield suspensions (&#8776;1&#160;mg&#160;mL&#8722;1) through UV&#8211;vis spectroscopy, all phyllosilicates present bandgap (Eg) narrowing from &#8776;7&#160;eV in the bulk to &#8776;4&#160;eV for monolayers. Unusually, the bandgap is inversely proportional to the areal size (A) of the nanosheets, measured via atomic force microscopy. Due to an unrecorded quantum confinement effect, nanosheet electronic properties scale toward semiconducting behavior (bandgap &#8776;3&#160;eV) as nanosheet area increases. Furthermore, modeling X&#8208;ray diffraction spectra shows that the root cause of the initial bandgap narrowing is lattice relaxation. Finally, with their broad range of isomorphically substituted ions, phyllosilicate nanosheets show remarkable catalytic properties for hydrogen production.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Control of Cycloidal Spin Order in a Metallic Van der Waals Magnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systematic and reversible control of cycloidal spin order with strains is demonstrated in the metallic van der Waals magnet Cr1/3TaS2 via strain&#8208;induced Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interactions. The remarkable tunability of Cr1/3TaS2 exemplifies the great potential of layered chiral magnets for highly&#8208;efficient straintronic applications.








Abstract
The manipulation of magnetism through strain control is a captivating area of research with potential applications for low&#8208;power devices that do not require dissipative currents. Recent investigations of insulating multiferroics have unveiled tunable relationships among polar lattice distortions, Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interactions (DMI), and cycloidal spin orders that break inversion symmetry. These findings have raised the possibility of utilizing strain or strain gradient to manipulate intricate magnetic states by changing polarization. However, the effectiveness of manipulating cycloidal spin orders in &#8220;metallic&#8221; materials with screened magnetism&#8208;relevant electric polarization remains uncertain. In this study, the reversible strain control of cycloidal spin textures in a metallic van der Waals magnet, Cr1/3TaS2, through the modulation of polarization and DMI induced by strain is demonstrated. With thermally&#8208;induced biaxial strains and isothermally&#8208;applied uniaxial strains, systematic manipulation of the sign and wavelength of the cycloidal spin textures is realized, respectively. Additionally, unprecedented reflectivity reduction under strain and domain modification at a record&#8208;low current density are also discovered. These findings establish a connection between polarization and cycloidal spins in metallic materials and present a new avenue for utilizing the remarkable tunability of cycloidal magnetic textures and optical functionality in van der Waals metals with strain.

     alt="Strain-Control of Cycloidal Spin Order in a Metallic Van der Waals Magnet"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systematic and reversible control of cycloidal spin order with strains is demonstrated in the metallic van der Waals magnet Cr&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;TaS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; via strain-induced Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interactions. The remarkable tunability of Cr&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;TaS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exemplifies the great potential of layered chiral magnets for highly-efficient straintronic applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manipulation of magnetism through strain control is a captivating area of research with potential applications for low-power devices that do not require dissipative currents. Recent investigations of insulating multiferroics have unveiled tunable relationships among polar lattice distortions, Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interactions (DMI), and cycloidal spin orders that break inversion symmetry. These findings have raised the possibility of utilizing strain or strain gradient to manipulate intricate magnetic states by changing polarization. However, the effectiveness of manipulating cycloidal spin orders in &#8220;metallic&#8221; materials with screened magnetism-relevant electric polarization remains uncertain. In this study, the reversible strain control of cycloidal spin textures in a metallic van der Waals magnet, Cr&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;TaS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, through the modulation of polarization and DMI induced by strain is demonstrated. With thermally-induced biaxial strains and isothermally-applied uniaxial strains, systematic manipulation of the sign and wavelength of the cycloidal spin textures is realized, respectively. Additionally, unprecedented reflectivity reduction under strain and domain modification at a record-low current density are also discovered. These findings establish a connection between polarization and cycloidal spins in metallic materials and present a new avenue for utilizing the remarkable tunability of cycloidal magnetic textures and optical functionality in van der Waals metals with strain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Zwitterionic CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals with Controlled Anisotropy using Surface&#8208;Selective Ligand Pairs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zwitterionic CsPbBr3 nanocrystals are synthesized with controlled anisotropy using a proposed &#8220;surface&#8208;selective ligand pairs&#8221; strategy. Combining experiments with density functional theory calculations, factors that govern the ligand binding affinity on different surface facets of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals are revealed. This study provides design rules for the further exploration of anisotropic lead halide perovskite nanocrystals.








Abstract
Mechanistic studies of the morphology of lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (LHP&#8208;NCs) are hampered by a lack of generalizable suitable synthetic strategies and ligand systems. Here, the synthesis of zwitterionic CsPbBr3 NCs is presented with controlled anisotropy using a proposed &#8220;surface&#8208;selective ligand pairs&#8221; strategy. Such a strategy provides a platform to systematically study the binding affinity of capping ligand pairs and the resulting LHP morphologies. By using zwitterionic ligands (ZwL) with varying structures, majority ZwL&#8208;capped LHP NCs with controlled morphology are obtained, including anisotropic nanoplatelets and nanorods, for the first time. Combining experiments with density functional theory calculations, factors that govern the ligand binding on the different surface facets of LHP&#8208;NCs are revealed, including the steric bulkiness of the ligand, the number of binding sites, and the charge distance between binding moieties. This study provides guidance for the further exploration of anisotropic LHP&#8208;NCs.

         <title>Sorption&#8208;Based Atmospheric Water Harvesting: Materials, Components, Systems, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
There is great potential for air humidity not only to provide water for drinking and agriculture, but also to be used for energy/fuel production, energy conservation, and humidity/thermal management. Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH) technology makes this possible even in dry regions. The purpose of this paper is to review comprehensively the materials, designs, components, and application of SAWH.








Abstract
Freshwater scarcity is a global challenge posing threats to the lives and daily activities of humankind such that two&#8208;thirds of the global population currently experience water shortages. Atmospheric water, irrespective of geographical location, is considered as an alternative water source. Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH) has recently emerged as an efficient strategy for decentralized water production. SAWH thus opens up a self&#8208;sustaining source of freshwater that can potentially support the global population for various applications. In this review, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of SAWH, considering its operation principle, thermodynamic analysis, energy assessment, materials, components, different designs, productivity improvement, scale&#8208;up, and application for drinking water, is first extensively explored. Thereafter, the practical integration and potential application of SAWH, beyond drinking water, for wide range of utilities in agriculture, fuel/electricity production, thermal management in building services, electronic devices, and textile are comprehensively discussed. The various strategies to reduce human reliance on natural water resources by integrating SAWH into existing technologies, particularly in underdeveloped countries, in order to satisfy the interconnected needs for food, energy, and water are also examined. This study further highlights the urgent need and future research directions to intensify the design and development of hybrid&#8208;SAWH systems for sustainability and diverse applications.

         <title>Flexible Organic Transistors for Biosensing: Devices and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible and stretchable organic transistors for biosensing are comprehensively reviewed, with detailed discussions on advanced functionalization strategies and the wide applications of organic transistors in wearable, implantable, and portable electronics, as well as neuromorphic biointerfaces. Special attention is paid to the innovations in stretchable devices and emerging e&#8208;skin and smart textiles. The remaining challenges and future opportunities are discussed.








Abstract
Flexible and stretchable biosensors can offer seamless and conformable biological&#8211;electronic interfaces for continuously acquiring high&#8208;fidelity signals, permitting numerous emerging applications. Organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) are ideal transducers for flexible and stretchable biosensing due to their soft nature, inherent amplification function, biocompatibility, ease of functionalization, low cost, and device diversity. In consideration of the rapid advances in flexible&#8208;OTFT&#8208;based biosensors and their broad applications, herein, a timely and comprehensive review is provided. It starts with a detailed introduction to the features of various OTFTs including organic field&#8208;effect transistors and organic electrochemical transistors, and the functionalization strategies for biosensing, with a highlight on the seminal work and up&#8208;to&#8208;date achievements. Then, the applications of flexible&#8208;OTFT&#8208;based biosensors in wearable, implantable, and portable electronics, as well as neuromorphic biointerfaces are detailed. Subsequently, special attention is paid to emerging stretchable organic transistors including planar and fibrous devices. The routes to impart stretchability, including structural engineering and material engineering, are discussed, and the implementations of stretchable organic transistors in e&#8208;skin and smart textiles are included. Finally, the remaining challenges and the future opportunities in this field are summarized.

         <title>Advances in In Vitro Models of Neuromuscular Junction: Focusing on Organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;Chip, Organoids, and Biohybrid Robotics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the advances in in vitro neuromuscular junction models with 2D and 3D cultures, from organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip and organoids to biohybrid robots, and introduces the related derivative techniques for functional analysis and stimulus methods, their application as disease models and for drug screening, and prospects for their future development and related challenges.








Abstract
The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a peripheral synaptic connection between presynaptic motor neurons and postsynaptic skeletal muscle fibers that enables muscle contraction and voluntary motor movement. Many traumatic, neurodegenerative, and neuroimmunological diseases are classically believed to mainly affect either the neuronal or the muscle side of the NMJ, and treatment options are lacking. Recent advances in novel techniques have helped develop in vitro physiological and pathophysiological models of the NMJ as well as enable precise control and evaluation of its functions. This paper reviews the recent developments in in vitro NMJ models with 2D or 3D cultures, from organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip and organoids to biohybrid robotics. Related derivative techniques are introduced for functional analysis of the NMJ, such as the patch&#8208;clamp technique, microelectrode arrays, calcium imaging, and stimulus methods, particularly optogenetic&#8208;mediated light stimulation, microelectrode&#8208;mediated electrical stimulation, and biochemical stimulation. Finally, the applications of the in vitro NMJ models as disease models or for drug screening related to suitable neuromuscular diseases are summarized and their future development trends and challenges are discussed.

         <title>Perovskite Smart Windows: The Light Manipulator in Energy&#8208;Efficient Buildings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Uncontrolled sunlight entering through windows contributes to substantial heating and cooling demands in buildings, which leads to high energy consumption from the buildings. Recently, perovskite smart windows have emerged as innovative energy&#8208;saving technologies, offering the potential to adaptively control indoor solar heat gain through their impressive sunlight modulation capabilities. Moreover, harnessing the high&#8208;efficiency photovoltaic properties of perovskite materials, these windows have the potential to generate power, thereby realizing more advanced windows with combined light modulation and energy harvesting capabilities. This review summarizes the recent advancements in various chromic perovskite materials for achieving light modulation, focusing on both perovskite structures and underlying switching mechanisms. The discussion also encompasses device engineering strategies for smart windows, including the improvement of their optical and transition performance, durability, combination with electricity generation, and the evaluation of their energy&#8208;saving performance in building applications. Furthermore, the challenges and opportunities associated with perovskite smart windows are explicated, aimed at stimulating more academic research and advancing their pragmatic implementation for building energy efficiency and sustainability.

Recently, perovskite smart windows have emerged as innovative energy-saving technologies, offering the potential to adaptively control indoor solar heat gain through their impressive sunlight modulation capabilities. Moreover, harnessing the high-efficiency photovoltaic properties of perovskite materials, these windows have the potential to generate power, thereby realizing more advanced windows with combined light modulation and energy harvesting capabilities. This review summarizes the recent advancements in various chromic perovskite materials for achieving light modulation, focusing on both perovskite structures and underlying switching mechanisms. The discussion also encompasses device engineering strategies for smart windows, including the improvement of their optical and transition performance, durability, combination with electricity generation, and the evaluation of their energy-saving performance in building applications. Furthermore, the challenges and opportunities associated with perovskite smart windows are explicated, aimed at stimulating more academic research and advancing their pragmatic implementation for building energy efficiency and sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Defect Driven Opto&#8208;Critical Phases Tuned for All&#8208;Solar Utilization</title>

Abstract
Materials imbued with uniformly dispersed, photo&#8208;responsive nanoparticles are instrumental in sustainable energy and photonic applications. Conventional methods, however, constrain their all&#8208;solar response. An innovative alternative is proposed: submerged photo&#8208;synthesis of crystallites (SPsC). It is shown that strategic doping with copper and oxygen vacancies can induce opto&#8208;critical phases from the non&#8208;stoichiometric tungstic acids (WO3&#183;H2O). These opto&#8208;critical phases enable a dynamic equilibrium shift in lattice defect stabilization, facilitating an unprecedented a whole solar wavelength response. This response manifests as photothermal, photo&#8208;assisted water evaporation, and photo&#8208;electrochemical characteristics. Harnessing all&#8208;solar energy, this one&#8208;pot SPsC strategy may steer the design and development of advanced oxide materials, enhancing functionality across diverse application domains.

         <title>Optimum Design Configuration of Thin&#8208;Film Transistors And Quantum&#8208;Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes for Active&#8208;Matrix Displays</title>

Abstract
Active matrix (AM) quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) driven by thin&#8208;film transistors (TFTs) have attracted significant attention for use in next&#8208;generation displays. Several challenges remain for the realisation of AM&#8208;QLEDs, such as device design, fabrication process, and integration between QLEDs and TFTs, depending on their device structures and configurations. Herein, we demonstrate efficient and stable AM&#8208;QLEDs using conventional and inverted structured QLEDs (C&#8208; and I&#8208;QLEDs, respectively) combined with facile type&#8208;convertible (p&#8208; and n&#8208;type) single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (SWNT)&#8208;based TFTs. Based on the four possible configurations of the QLED&#8211;TFT subpixel, we compare the performance of the SWNT TFT&#8208;driven QLEDs and the fabrication process to determine the ideal configuration, taking advantage of each structure for AM&#8208;QLEDs. We also optimise the QLEDs and TFTs to maximise the performance of the AM&#8208;QLEDs&#8212;the inner shell composition of quantum dots and carrier type of TFTs&#8212;resulting in a maximum external quantum efficiency and operational lifetime (at an initial luminance of 100&#160;cd/m2) of 21.2% and 38,100,000&#160;h for the C&#8208;QLED, and 19.1% and 133,100,000&#160;h for the I&#8208;QLED, respectively. Finally, we successfully demonstrate a 5&#215;5 AM&#8208;QLED display array controlled using SWNT TFTs. This study is expected to contribute to the development of advanced AM&#8208;QLED displays.

&lt;p&gt;Active matrix (AM) quantum-dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) driven by thin-film transistors (TFTs) have attracted significant attention for use in next-generation displays. Several challenges remain for the realisation of AM-QLEDs, such as device design, fabrication process, and integration between QLEDs and TFTs, depending on their device structures and configurations. Herein, we demonstrate efficient and stable AM-QLEDs using conventional and inverted structured QLEDs (C- and I-QLEDs, respectively) combined with facile type-convertible (p- and n-type) single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT)-based TFTs. Based on the four possible configurations of the QLED&#8211;TFT subpixel, we compare the performance of the SWNT TFT-driven QLEDs and the fabrication process to determine the ideal configuration, taking advantage of each structure for AM-QLEDs.

         <title>Antibubbles Enable Tunable Payload Release with Low&#8208;Intensity Ultrasound</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The benefits of ultrasound are its ease&#8208;of&#8208;use and its ability to precisely deliver energy in opaque and complex media. However, most materials responsive to ultrasound show a weak response, requiring the use of high powers, which are associated with undesirable streaming, cavitation, or temperature rise. These effects hinder response control and may even cause damage to the medium where the ultrasound is applied. Moreover, materials that are currently in use rely on all&#8208;or&#8208;nothing effects, limiting the ability to fine&#8208;tune the response of the material on the fly. For these reasons, there is a need for materials that can respond to low intensity ultrasound with programmable responses. Here it is demonstrated that antibubbles are a low&#8208;intensity&#8208;ultrasound&#8208;responsive material system that can controllably release a payload using acoustic pressures in the kPa range. Varying their size and composition tunes the release pressure, and the response can be switched between a single release and stepwise release across multiple ultrasound pulses. Observations using confocal and high&#8208;speed microscopy revealed different ways that can lead to release. These findings lay the groundwork to design antibubbles that controllably respond to low&#8208;intensity ultrasound, opening a wide range of applications ranging from ultrasound&#8208;responsive material systems to carriers for targeted&#160;delivery.

         <title>A Personalized Cancer Nanovaccine that Enhances T&#8208;Cell Responses and Efficacy through Dual Interactions with Dendritic Cells and T Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Conventional approaches to developing therapeutic cancer vaccines that primarily activate tumor&#8208;specific T cells via dendritic cells (DCs) often demonstrate limited efficacy due to the suboptimal activation of these T cells. To address this limitation, here we develop a therapeutic cancer nanovaccine that enhances T cell responses by interacting with both DCs and T cells. The nanovaccine is based on a cancer cell membrane nanoparticle (CCM&#8208;MPLA) that utilizes monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) as an adjuvant. To allow direct interaction between the nanovaccine and tumor&#8208;specific T cells, anti&#8208;CD28 antibodies (aCD28) are conjugated onto CCM&#8208;MPLA, resulting in CCM&#8211;MPLA&#8211;aCD28. This nanovaccine activates tumor&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells in both presence and absence of DCs. Compared with nanovaccines that interact with either DCs (CCM&#8211;MPLA) or T cells (CCM&#8211;aCD28), CCM&#8211;MPLA&#8211;aCD28 induces more potent responses of tumor&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells and exhibits a higher antitumor efficacy in tumor&#8208;bearing mice. No differences in T cell activation efficiency and therapeutic efficacy are observed between CCM&#8211;MPLA and CCM&#8211;aCD28. This approach may lead to the development of effective personalized therapeutic cancer vaccines prepared from autologous cancer cells.

         <title>Introducing Phenyl End Group in The Inner Side Chains of A&#8208;Da'd&#8208;A Acceptors Enables High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells Processed with Nonhalogenated Solvent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) has reached the threshold for application. However, the high PCEs are mostly obtained from the small&#8208;area OSCs processed by the halogenated solvent, such as chloroform (CF), because the high&#8208;performance A&#8208;DA'D&#8208;A type small molecule acceptors (SMAs) need the CF processing for suitable solubility and rapid solvent evaporation to get appropriate aggregation morphology. Herein, we&#160;synthesized two new A&#8208;DA'D&#8208;A type SMAs of Y6&#8208;Ph and L8&#8208;Ph by introducing a phenyl end group in the branched alkyl inner side chains of the representative SMAs Y6 and L8&#8208;BO respectively, for overcoming the excessive aggregation of SMAs in the long&#8208;time film&#8208;forming process in the nonhalogenated solvent processing. Firstly, we&#160;studied the effect of the processing solvent boiling point on the aggregation property and photovoltaic performance of the four SMAs of Y6, L8&#8208;BO, Y6&#8208;Ph and L8&#8208;Ph, by using the most commonly used halogenated processing solvents: low&#8208;boiling&#8208;point CF (rapid film forming process) and high&#8208;boiling&#8208;point chlorobenzene (CB) (slow film forming process) for device fabrication of the OSCs with PM6 as polymer donor. It was&#160;found that the Y6&#8208; and L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based OSCs exhibit a dramatic drop in PCEs from CF&#8208; to CB&#8208;processed devices owing to the large phase separation in the CB&#8208;processed OSCs. On the contrary, the devices based on Y6&#8208;Ph and L8&#8208;Ph with the phenyl ending inner side chains show obviously increased PCEs for the OSCs processed by high&#8208;boiling&#8208;point CB. The L8&#8208;Ph&#8208;based devices processed by CB demonstrated an PCE of 18.83% with a high FF of 80.55%, which is even better than the L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based OSCs processed by CF. Furthermore, the L8&#8208;Ph&#8208;based OSCs processed by nonhalogenated solvent o&#8208;xylene (o&#8208;XY) also achieved a high PCE of 18.40% with an FF of 80.11%, which is the best&#8208;performed OSC fabricated from the nonhalogenated solvents so far. In addition, the large&#8208;area (1 cm2) OSCs based on PM6:L8&#8208;Ph processed by o&#8208;XY also demonstrated a higher PCE of 16.66%. The results indicate that introducing phenyl end group in the inner side chains is an effective strategy to improve photovoltaic performance of the A&#8208;DA'D&#8208;A SMAs for future application of the OSCs with nonhalogenated solvent processing.

Furthermore, the L8-Ph-based OSCs processed by nonhalogenated solvent &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-xylene (&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-XY) also achieved a high PCE of 18.40% with an FF of 80.11%, which is the best-performed OSC fabricated from the nonhalogenated solvents so far. In addition, the large-area (1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) OSCs based on PM6:L8-Ph processed by &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-XY also demonstrated a higher PCE of 16.66%. The results indicate that introducing phenyl end group in the inner side chains is an effective strategy to improve photovoltaic performance of the A-DA'D-A SMAs for future application of the OSCs with nonhalogenated solvent processing.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synthesis of 2H/fcc&#8208;Heterophase AuCu Nanostructures for Highly Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Reduction at Industrial Current Densities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Structural engineering of nanomaterials offers a promising way for developing high&#8208;performance catalysts towards catalysis. However, the delicate modulation of thermodynamically unfavorable nanostructures with unconventional phases still remains a challenge. Here, we report the synthesis of hierarchical AuCu nanostructures with hexagonal close&#8208;packed (2H&#8208;type)/face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) heterophase, high&#8208;index facets, planar defects (e.g., stacking faults, twin boundaries, and grain boundaries), and tunable Cu content. The obtained 2H/fcc Au99Cu1 hierarchical nanosheets exhibit excellent performance for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to produce CO, outperforming the 2H/fcc Au91Cu9 and fcc Au99Cu1. Our experimental results, especially those obtained by in situ differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy and attenuated total reflection Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy, suggest that the enhanced catalytic performance of 2H/fcc Au99Cu1 arises from the unconventional 2H/fcc heterophase, high&#8208;index facets, planar defects, and appropriate alloying of Cu. Impressively, the 2H/fcc Au99Cu1 shows CO Faradaic efficiencies of 96.6% and 92.6% at industrial current densities of 300 mA cm&#8722;2 and 500 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively, as well as good durability, placing it among the best CO2 reduction electrocatalysts for CO production. Our atomically structural regulation based on phase engineering of nanomaterials (PEN) provides an avenue for the rational design and preparation of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for various catalytic applications.

         <title>Exceptional Microscale Plasticity in Amorphous Aluminum Oxide at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Oxide glasses are an elementary group of materials in modern society, but brittleness limits their wider usability at room temperature. As an exception to the rule, amorphous aluminum oxide (a&#8208;Al2O3) is a rare diatomic glassy material exhibiting significant nanoscale plasticity at room temperature. Here we show experimentally that the room temperature plasticity of a&#8208;Al2O3 extends to the microscale and high strain rates using in situ micropillar compression. All tested a&#8208;Al2O3 micropillars deform without fracture at up to 50% strain via a combined mechanism of viscous creep and shear band slip propagation. Large&#8208;scale molecular dynamics simulations align with the main experimental observations and verify the plasticity mechanism at the atomic scale. The experimental strain rates reach magnitudes typical for impact loading scenarios, such as hammer forging, with strain rates up to the order of 1 000 s&#8722;1, and we expand the total a&#8208;Al2O3 sample volume exhibiting significant low&#8208;temperature plasticity without fracture by 5 orders of magnitude from previous observations. The discovery is consistent with the theoretical prediction that the plasticity observed in a&#8208;Al2O3 can extend to macroscopic bulk scale and suggests that amorphous oxides show significant potential to be used as light, high&#8208;strength, and damage&#8208;tolerant engineering materials.

         <title>Tuning Ligands Ratio Allows for Controlling Gold Nanocluster Conformation And Activating A Nonantimicrobial Thiol Fragrance for Effective Treatment of MRSA&#8208;induced Keratitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Bacterial keratitis is a serious ocular disease that affects millions of people worldwide each year, among which &#8764;25% are caused by Staphylococcus aureus. With the spread of bacterial resistance, refractory keratitis caused by methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) affects &#8764;120&#8211;190 thousand people annually and has become a significant cause of infectious blindness. Atomically precise gold nanoclusters (GNCs) have recently emerged as promising antibacterial agents, although how GNC structure and capping ligands control its antibacterial properties remain largely unexplored. In this study, by adjusting the ratio of a &#8220;bulky&#8221; thiol fragrance to a linear zwitterionic ligand, the GNC conformation is transformed from Au25(SR)18 to Au23(SR)16 species, simultaneously converting both inactive thiol ligands into potent antibacterial nanomaterials. Surprisingly, mixed&#8208;ligand capped Au23(SR)16 GNCs exhibit superior antibacterial potency compared to their mono&#8208;ligand counterparts. The optimal GNC is highly potent against MRSA, showing &gt;1024&#8208;fold lower minimum inhibitory concentration than the corresponding free ligands. Moreover, it displays excellent potency in treating MRSA&#8208;induced keratitis in mice with greatly accelerated corneal recovery (by &#8764;9&#8208;fold). Thus, this study establishes a feasible method to synthesize antibacterial GNCs by adjusting the ligand ratio to control GNC conformation and active non&#8208;antibacterial ligands, thereby greatly increasing the repertoires for combating multidrug&#8208;resistant bacterial infections.

         <title>Acid and Hypoxia Tandem&#8208;Activatable Deep Near&#8208;Infrared Nanoprobe for Two&#8208;Step Signal Amplification and Early Detection of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphorescent nanoprobe comprised of oxygen&#8208;sensitive deep near&#8208;infrared (dNIR)&#8208;emitting phosphorescence cores and acid&#8208;cleavable polyethene glycol (PEG) shells, that is ultrasensitive to tumor acidity and hypoxia. This tandem&#8208;activatable probe design specifically amplifies tumor signals and enables early tumor detection, the signal in deep NIR region promoting contrast and resolution of hypoxia imaging as well.








Abstract
The early detection of cancers can significantly change outcomes even with existing treatments. However, ~50% of cancers still cannot be detected until they reach an advanced stage, highlighting the great challenges in the early detection. Here, an ultrasensitive deep near&#8208;infrared (dNIR) nanoprobe that is successively responsive to tumor acidity and hypoxia is reported. It is demonstrated that the new nanoprobe specifically detects tumor hypoxia microenvironment based on deep NIR imaging in ten different types of tumor models using cancer cell lines and patient&#8208;tissue derived xenograft tumors. By combining the acidity and hypoxia specific two&#8208;step signal amplification with a deep NIR detection, the reported nanoprobe enables the ultrasensitive visualization of hundreds of tumor cells or small tumors with a size of 260&#160;&#181;m in whole&#8208;body imaging or 115&#160;&#181;m metastatic lesions in lung imaging. As a result, it reveals that tumor hypoxia can occur as early as the lesions contain only several hundred cancer cells.

         <title>Reduced Graphene Oxide Electrolyte&#8208;Gated Transistor Immunosensor with Highly Selective Multiparametric Detection of Anti&#8208;Drug Antibodies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrolyte&#8208;gated transistor immunosensor based on reduced graphene oxide (rGO&#8208;EGT) for the detection of anti&#8208;drug antibodies (ATIs) against the drug Infliximab is reported. The multiparametric analysis of the immunosensor response, with a theoretical limit of detection of 10 am, allows for the discrimination between ATIs and interfering agents.








Abstract
The advent of immunotherapies with biological drugs has revolutionized the treatment of cancers and auto&#8208;immune diseases. However, in some patients, the production of anti&#8208;drug antibodies (ADAs) hampers the drug efficacy. The concentration of ADAs is typically in the range of 1&#8211;10 pm; hence their immunodetection is challenging.

&lt;p&gt;An electrolyte-gated transistor immunosensor based on reduced graphene oxide (rGO-EGT) for the detection of anti-drug antibodies (ATIs) against the drug Infliximab is reported. The multiparametric analysis of the immunosensor response, with a theoretical limit of detection of 10 a&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;, allows for the discrimination between ATIs and interfering agents.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advent of immunotherapies with biological drugs has revolutionized the treatment of cancers and auto-immune diseases. However, in some patients, the production of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) hampers the drug efficacy. The concentration of ADAs is typically in the range of 1&#8211;10 p&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;; hence their immunodetection is challenging. ADAs toward Infliximab (IFX), a drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other auto-immune diseases, are focussed. An ambipolar electrolyte-gated transistor (EGT) immunosensor is reported based on a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) channel and IFX bound to the gate electrode as the specific probe. The rGO-EGTs are easy to fabricate and exhibit low voltage operations (&#8804; 0.3&#160;V), a robust response within 15&#160;min, and ultra-high sensitivity (10 a&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; limit of detection). A multiparametric analysis of the whole rGO-EGT transfer curves based on the type-I generalized extreme value distribution is proposed. It is demonstrated that it allows to selectively quantify ADAs also in the co-presence of its antagonist tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;), the natural circulating target of IFX.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anti&#8208;Fatigue Hydrogel Electrolyte for All&#8208;Flexible Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The compressive fatigue&#8208;resistance properties of the hydrogel electrolytes are systematically explored, revealing the critical roles of the salt and copolymer matrix on crack initiation and propagation. The optimal hydrogel electrolytes endow the Zn metal anode with a superior cycling lifespan and demonstrate great potential in wearable electronics with all flexible features.








Abstract
Hydrogel electrolytes are widely explored in Zn metal batteries for application in wearable electronics. While extensive studies have been conducted on optimizing the chemical structure and boosting the tensile elasticity, the mechanical stability of the hydrogel under repeated deformation is largely overlooked, leading to unsatisfactory performance at large cycling capacity. This work systematically analyzes the compressive fatigue&#8208;resistance properties of the hydrogel electrolyte, revealing the critical roles of the salt and copolymer matrix on crack initiation and propagation. It shows that, on the premise of homogeneous Zn deposition, an improved anti&#8208;fatigue property is essential to achieve high&#8208;capacity Zn metal anodes. The optimal Zn(ClO4)2&#8208;polyacrylamide/chitosan hydrogel electrolyte (C&#8208;PAMCS) exhibits an unprecedented lifespan of 1500&#160;h for Zn//Zn cells at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a high areal capacity of 10 mAh cm&#8722;2. The potential application of C&#8208;PAMCS is exemplified in all&#8208;flexible Zn&#8208;ion batteries enabled by a flexible current collector consisting of a Ag nanowires embedded elastomer. This study provides the rationale under hydrogel electrolyte engineering toward advanced Zn&#8208;ion battereis and the application in flexible devices.

         <title>Component Distribution Regulation in Sn&#8208;Pb Perovskite Solar Cells through Selective Molecular Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disordered Sn/Pb ratio and heterojunctions in perovskite film can be suppressed through selective molecular interaction. Hydrazine sulfate (HS) is introduced in Sn perovskite precursor and reduces the crystallization rate of tin perovskite to the level of lead analog. Therefore, a Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite film with uniform component and energy distribution, as well as devices with low recombination loss are achieved.








Abstract
Tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with near&#8208;ideal bandgap still lag behind the pure lead PSCs. Disordered heterojunctions caused by inhomogeneous Sn/Pb ratio in the binary perovskite film induce large recombination loss. Here, an Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite film is reported with homogeneous component and energy distribution by introducing hydrazine sulfate (HS) in Sn perovskite precursor. HS can form hydrogen bond network and coordinate with FASnI3 thus no longer bond with Pb2+, which reduces the crystallization rate of tin perovskite to the level of lead analog. The strong bonding between SO42&#8722; and Sn2+ can also suppress its oxidation. As a result, the Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs with HS exhibit a significantly improved VOC of 0.91 V along with a high efficiency of 23.17%. Meanwhile, the hydrogen bond interaction network, strong bonding between Sn2+ and sulfate ion also improve the thermal, storage, and air stability of resulting devices.

         <title>Spatially Confined Silver Nanoparticles in Mercapto Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks to Compartmentalize Li Deposition Toward Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, Ag nanoparticles are chemically implanted into mercapto&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic frameworks, and the lithiophilic assemblies are utilized to modify Cu current collector for achieving reversible and dendrite&#8208;free Li plating/stripping. Owing to the compartmentalized Li storage, symmetric and full cells demonstrate prolonged cycling over 1500 and 1000&#160;cycles, respectively, with a near&#8208;unity Coulombic efficiency.








Abstract
As the promising next&#8208;generation energy storage solution, lithium metal battery (LMB) has gained great attention but still suffers from troubles associated with the highly active metallic lithium. Herein, it is&#160;aimed to develop an anode&#8208;free LMB engaging no Li disk or foil by modifying the Cu current collector with mercapto metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) impregnating Ag nanoparticles (NPs). While the polar mercapto groups facilitate and guide Li+ transport, the highly lithiophilic Ag NPs help to enhance the electric conductivity and lower the energy barrier of Li nucleation. Furthermore, the MOF pores allow compartmentalizing bulk Li into a 3D matrix Li storage so that not only the local current density is reduced, but also is the plating/stripping reversibility greatly enhanced. As a result, full cells pairing the prelithiated Ag@Zr&#8208;DMBD/Cu anodes with LiFePO4 cathodes demonstrate a high initial specific capacity of 159.8&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, first&#8208;cycle Coulombic efficiency of 96.6%, and long&#8208;term cycling stability over 1000&#160;cycles with 99.3% capacity retention at 1&#160;C. This study underlines the multi&#8208;aspect functionalization of MOFs to impart lithiophilicity, polarity, and porosity to achieve reversible Li plating/stripping and paves the way for realizing high&#8208;performance anode&#8208;free LMBs through exquisite modification of the Cu current collector.

         <title>Structural Color Mixing in Microcapsules through Exclusive Crystallization of Binary and Ternary Colloids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photonic microcapsules with dual or triple stopbands are created by exclusively crystallizing binary or ternary colloids in double&#8208;emulsion droplets. The controlled depletion attraction induces homogeneous particle association to produce distinct crystalline grains, preventing glassy alloy formation. The resulting microcapsules exhibit highly&#8208;saturated mixed structural colors that can be controlled through the selection of particle sizes and mixing ratios.








Abstract
Colloidal crystals are designed as photonic microparticles for various applications. However, conventional microparticles generally have only one stopband from a single lattice constant, which restricts the range of colors and optical codes available. Here, photonic microcapsules are created that contain two or three distinct crystalline grains, resulting in dual or triple stopbands that offer a wider range of colors through structural color mixing. To produce distinct colloidal crystallites from binary or ternary colloidal mixtures, the interparticle interaction is manipulated using depletion forces in double&#8208;emulsion droplets. Aqueous dispersions of binary or ternary colloidal mixtures in the innermost droplet are gently concentrated in the presence of a depletant and salt by imposing hypertonic conditions. Different&#8208;sized particles crystallize into their own crystals rather than forming random glassy alloys to minimize free energy. The average size of the crystalline grains can be adjusted with osmotic pressure, and the relative ratio of distinct grains can be controlled with the mixing ratio of particles. The resulting microcapsules with small grains and high surface coverage are almost optically isotropic and exhibit highly&#8208;saturated mixed structural colors and multiple reflectance peaks. The mixed color and reflectance spectrum are controllable with the selection of particle sizes and mixing ratios.

         <title>Wafer&#8208;Scale Epitaxial Growth of Two&#8208;dimensional Organic Semiconductor Single Crystals toward High&#8208;Performance Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anchored crystal&#8208;seed epitaxial growth method is developed to effectively suppress the multiple nucleation behavior of the molecules and enhance the 2D growth of organic crystals. In consequence, wafer&#8208;scale few&#8208;layer organic single crystals are successfully fabricated on the viscous liquid substrate. Organic field&#8208;effect transistors based on the crystal exhibit high device performance with excellent uniformity.








Abstract
The success of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electronics and optoelectronics relies heavily on the capability to fabricate semiconductor single&#8208;crystal wafers. However, the conventional epitaxial growth strategy for inorganic wafers is invalid for growing organic semiconductor single crystals due to the lack of lattice&#8208;matched epitaxial substrates and intricate nucleation behaviors, severely impeding the advancement of organic single&#8208;crystal electronics. Here, an anchored crystal&#8208;seed epitaxial growth method for wafer&#8208;scale growth of 2D organic semiconductor single crystals is developed for the first time. The crystal seed is firmly anchored on the viscous liquid surface, ensuring the steady epitaxial growth of organic single crystals from the crystal seed. The atomically flat liquid surface effectively eliminates the disturbance from substrate defects and greatly enhances the 2D growth of organic crystals. Using this approach, a wafer&#8208;scale few&#8208;layer bis(triethylsilythynyl)&#8208;anthradithphene (Dif&#8208;TES&#8208;ADT) single crystal is formed, yielding a breakthrough for organic field&#8208;effect transistors with a high reliable mobility up to 8.6 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and an ultralow mobility variable coefficient of 8.9%. This work opens a new avenue to fabricate organic single&#8208;crystal wafers for high&#8208;performance organic electronics.

         <title>A Smart DNA&#8208;Based Nanosystem Containing Ribosome&#8208;Regulating&#160;siRNA for Enhanced mRNA Transfection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart DNA&#8208;based nanosystem with an siRNA&#8208;mediated regulation pathway that upregulates mRNA translation and enhances mRNA transfection is reported. The DNA&#8208;based nanosystem disassembles and releases siRNA and mRNA in response to intracellular stimuli and promotes ribosome biogenesis through intracellular glutathione depletion, which facilitates the mRNA delivery in hard&#8208;to&#8208;transfect cells both in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Messenger RNA (mRNA) transfection is the prerequisite for the application of mRNA&#8208;based therapeutics. In hard&#8208;to&#8208;transfect cells, such as macrophages, the effective transfection of mRNA remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, a smart DNA&#8208;based nanosystem is reported containing ribosome biogenesis&#8208;promoting siRNA, realizing efficient mRNA transfection in macrophages. Four monomers are copolymerized to form a nanoframework (NF), including N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) as the skeleton and acrydite&#8208;DNA as the initiator to trigger the cascade assembly of DNA hairpins (H1&#8208;polyT and H2&#8208;siRNA). By virtue of the phase transition characteristic of polymeric NIPAM, below the lower critical solution temperature (LCST, &#8776;34&#160;&#176;C), the NF swells to expose polyT sequences to hybridize with the polyA tail of mRNA. Above the LCST, the NF deswells to encapsulate mRNA. The disulfide bond in the NF responds to glutathione, triggering the disassembly of the nanosystem; the siRNA and mRNA are released in response to triphosadenine and RNase H. The siRNA down&#8208;regulates the expression of heat shock protein 27, which up&#8208;regulates the expression of phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6. The nanosystem shows satisfactory mRNA transfection and translation efficiency in a mouse model. It is envisioned that the DNA&#8208;based nanosystem will provide a promising carrier to deliver mRNA in hard&#8208;to&#8208;transfect cells and promote the development of mRNA&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>Boosting the Performance of Organic Photodetectors with a Solution&#8208;Processed Integration Circuit toward Ubiquitous Health Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processed integration circuit consisting of an organic field&#8208;effect transistor with an ultrahigh signal amplification efficiency, an organic photoconductor, and an organic resistor is proposed to dramatically boost the photoresponse signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, enabling the accurate extraction of physiological information from the photoplethysmographic waveforms, which can promote the development of ubiquitous health monitoring.








Abstract
Organic photodetectors, as an emerging wearable photoplethysmographic (PPG) technology, offer exciting opportunities for next&#8208;generation photonic healthcare electronics. However, the mutual restraints among photoresponse, structure complexity, and fabrication cost have intrinsically limited the development of organic photodetectors for ubiquitous health monitoring in daily activities. Here, an effective route to dramatically boost the performance of organic photodetectors with a solution&#8208;processed integration circuit for health monitoring application is reported. Through creating an ideal metal&#8211;semiconductor junction interface that minimizes the trap states within the device, solution&#8208;printed organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) are achieved with an ultrahigh signal amplification efficiency of 37.1 S A&#8722;1, approaching the theoretical thermionic limit. Consequently, monolithic integration of the OFET with an organic photoconductor enables the remarkable amplification of photoresponse signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio by more than four orders of magnitude from 5.5 to 4.6 &#215; 105, which is able to meet the demand for accurately extracting physiological information from the PPG waveforms. This work offers an effective and versatile approach to greatly enhance the photodetector performance, promising to revolutionize health monitoring technologies.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Meet Polymers: From Synthesis Strategies to Healthcare Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybridizing metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with flexible polymers leads to unique properties wherein the incorporation of suitable polymers enhances the MOF performance. This review highlights the recent advances in the preparation of MOF&#8211;polymer nanomaterials, and discusses their applications in anticancer therapy, anti&#8208;bacteria treatment, imaging, protection from oxidative stress and inflammation, and environmental remediation. Insights from the current research and design principles are revealed for addressing future challenges.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been at the forefront of nanotechnological research for the past decade owing to their high porosity, high surface area, diverse configurations, and controllable chemical structures. They are a rapidly developing class of nanomaterials that are predominantly applied in batteries, supercapacitors, electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, sensors, drug delivery, gas separation, adsorption, and storage. However, the limited functions and unsatisfactory performance of MOFs resulting from their low chemical and mechanical stability hamper further development. Hybridizing MOFs with polymers is an excellent solution to these problems, because polymers&#8212;which are soft, flexible, malleable, and processable&#8212;can induce unique properties in the hybrids based on those of the two disparate components while retaining their individuality. This review highlights recent advances in the preparation of MOF&#8211;polymer nanomaterials. Furthermore, several applications wherein the incorporation of polymers enhances the MOF performance are discussed, such as anticancer therapy, bacterial elimination, imaging, therapeutics, protection from oxidative stress and inflammation, and environmental remediation. Finally, insights from the focus of existing research and design principles for mitigating future challenges are presented.

         <title>Manipulation of Charge Dynamics for Efficient and Bright Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Chiral Ligands</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By manipulating the charge dynamics through a novel chiral organic cation passivator and a ladder&#8208;like energy architecture, blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) exhibit a maximum external quantum efficiency of 13.15%, a luminance of 8170&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, and a record power efficiency of 18.42&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1 with stable emissions, rendering that the performance is among the best blue PeLEDs.








Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) emerge as a promising class of optoelectronic devices for next&#8208;generation displays and lighting technology. However, the performance of blue PeLEDs lags far behind that of their green and red counterparts, including the unachieved trade&#8208;off between high efficiency and high luminance, severe efficiency roll&#8208;off, and unsatisfactory power efficiency. Here, a multi&#8208;functional chiral ligand of L&#8208;phenylalanine methyl ester hydrochloride is strategically introduced into quasi&#8208;2D perovskites, which can effectively passivate defects, modulate the phase distribution, improve photoluminescence quantum yield, guarantee high&#8208;quality film morphology, and enhance charge transport. Furthermore, ladder&#8208;like hole transport layers are established, boosting charge injection and balance. The resultant sky&#8208;blue PeLEDs (the photoluminescence peak is 493&#160;nm and the electroluminescence peak is 497&#160;nm) exhibit an external quantum efficiency of 12.43% at 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 and a record power efficiency of 18.42&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1, rendering that the performance is among the best blue PeLEDs.

The resultant sky-blue PeLEDs (the photoluminescence peak is 493&#160;nm and the electroluminescence peak is 497&#160;nm) exhibit an external quantum efficiency of 12.43% at 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a record power efficiency of 18.42&#160;lm&#160;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, rendering that the performance is among the best blue PeLEDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Porosity as a Design Element for Developing Catalytic Molecular Materials for Electrochemical and Photochemical Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular materials catalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), that feature permanent porosity as a design feature, are showcased. Selected examples provide insights into how different approaches to this overall design strategy can augment their electrocatalytic and/or photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity.








Abstract
The catalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) using sustainable energy inputs is a promising strategy for upcycling of atmospheric carbon into value&#8208;added chemical products. This goal has inspired the development of catalysts for selective and efficient CO2 conversion using electrochemical and photochemical methods. Among the diverse array of catalyst systems designed for this purpose, 2D and 3D platforms that feature porosity offer the potential to combine carbon capture and conversion. Included are covalent organic frameworks (COFs), metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), porous molecular cages, and other hybrid molecular materials developed to increase active site exposure, stability, and water compatibility while maintaining precise molecular tunability. This mini&#8208;review showcases catalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) that incorporate well&#8208;defined molecular elements integrated into porous materials structures. Selected examples provide insights into how different approaches to this overall design strategy can augment their electrocatalytic and/or photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity.

         <title>Biocatalytic Foams from Microdroplet&#8208;Formulated Self&#8208;Assembling Enzymes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocatalytically active enzyme foams produced via microdroplet foaming of self&#8208;assembling enzymes exhibit a regular hexagonal honeycomb network, the mechanical stability of which increases by drying to achieve high biocatalytic performance in continuous flow processes.








Abstract
Industrial biocatalysis plays an important role in the development of a sustainable economy, as enzymes can be used to synthesize an enormous range of complex molecules under environmentally friendly conditions. To further develop the field, intensive research is being conducted on process technologies for continuous flow biocatalysis in order to immobilize large quantities of enzyme biocatalysts in microstructured flow reactors under conditions that are as gentle as possible in order to realize efficient material conversions. Here, monodisperse foams consisting almost entirely of enzymes covalently linked via SpyCatcher/SpyTag conjugation are reported. The biocatalytic foams are readily available from recombinant enzymes via microfluidic air&#8208;in&#8208;water droplet formation, can be directly integrated into microreactors, and can be used for biocatalytic conversions after drying. Reactors prepared by this method show surprisingly high stability and biocatalytic activity. The physicochemical characterization of the new materials is described and exemplary applications in biocatalysis are shown using two&#8208;enzyme cascades for the stereoselective synthesis of chiral alcohols and the rare sugar tagatose.

         <title>PdNi Biatomic Clusters from Metallene Unlock Record&#8208;Low Onset Dehydrogenation Temperature for Bulk&#8208;MgH2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unprecedented initial dehydrogenation temperature of bulk MgH2&#8208;PdNi is 422 K, which is lower than the most bulk MgH2&#8208;based composites. PdNi alloy clusters with suitable d&#8208;band centers are used as the main active sites, which together with Pd/Ni pure phase clusters and Pd/Ni single atoms in situ enhance the desorption/absorption process.








Abstract
Hydrogen storage has long been a priority on the renewable energy research agenda. Due to its high volumetric and gravimetric hydrogen density, MgH2 is a desirable candidate for solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage. However, its practical use is constrained by high thermal stability and sluggish kinetics. Here, PdNi bilayer metallenes are reported as catalysts for hydrogen storage of bulk&#8208;MgH2 near ambient temperature. Unprecedented 422 K beginning dehydrogenation temperature and up to 6.36&#160;wt.% reliable hydrogen storage capacity are achieved. Fast hydrogen desorption is also provided by the system (5.49&#160;wt.% in 1&#160;h, 523 K). The in situ generated PdNi alloy clusters with suitable d&#8208;band centers are identified as the main active sites during the de/re&#8208;hydrogenation process by aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy and theoretical simulations, while other active species including Pd/Ni pure phase clusters and Pd/Ni single atoms obtained via metallene ball milling, also enhance the reaction. These findings present fundamental insights into active species identification and rational design of highly efficient hydrogen storage materials.

         <title>Bilayer Zwitterionic Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Selective All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Superionic Conduction in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte featuring bilayer zwitterionic nanochannels (BZN) is constructed by grafting soft multicationic oligomers (MCOs) onto a rigid anionic MOF framework. The unique BZN can serve as ion&#8208;selectivity gates, specifically promoting the transport of Li+ and rendering stable operation of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density solid&#8208;state full cells.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) hold immense potential for improved energy density and safety compared to traditional batteries. However, existing solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) face challenges in meeting the complex operational requirements of SSBs. This study&#160;introduces a novel approach to address this issue by developing a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) with customized bilayer zwitterionic nanochannels (MOF&#8208;BZN) as high&#8208;performance SSEs. The BZN consist of a rigid anionic MOF channel with chemically grafted soft multicationic oligomers (MCOs) on the pore wall. This design enables selective superionic conduction, with MCOs restricting the movement of anions while coulombic interaction between MCOs and anionic framework promoting the dissociation of Li+. MOF&#8208;BZN exhibits remarkable Li+ conductivity (8.76 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1), high Li+ transference number (0.75), and a wide electrochemical window of up to 4.9&#160;V at 30 &#176;C. Ultimately, the SSB utilizing flame retarded MOF&#8208;BZN achieves an impressive specific energy of 419.6&#160;Wh kganode+cathode+electrolyte&#8722;1 under constrained conditions of high cathode loading (20.1&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) and limited lithium metal source. The constructed bilayer zwitterionic MOFs present a pioneering strategy for developing advanced SSEs for highly efficient SSBs.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Interface Modulation with Covalent Organic Framework Enables Efficient and Durable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;interface modulation strategy is demonstrated using functional covalent organic frameworks to fabricate the high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells; a champion efficiency of 24.26% is obtained together with enhanced long&#8208;term stability due to released tensile stress, reduced trap state density, as well as enhanced resistance of humidity and ultraviolet irradiation.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;interface modulation including buried interface as well as the top surface has recently been proven to be crucial for obtaining high photovoltaic performance in lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, for the first time, the strategy of using functional covalent organic frameworks (COFs), namely HS&#8208;COFs for dual&#8208;interface modulation, is reported to further understand its intrinsic mechanisms in optimizing the bottom and top surfaces. Specifically, the buried HS&#8208;COFs layer can enhance the resistance against ultraviolet radiation, and more importantly, release the tensile strain, which is beneficial for enhancing device stability and improving the order of perovskite crystal growth. Furthermore, the detailed characterization results reveal that the HS&#8208;COFs on the top surface can effectively passivate the surface defects and suppress non&#8208;radiation recombination, as well as optimize the crystallization and growth of the perovskite film. Benefiting from the synergistic effects, the dual&#8208;interface modified devices deliver champion efficiencies of 24.26% and 21.30% for 0.0725 cm2 and 1 cm2&#8208;sized devices, respectively. Moreover, they retain 88% and 84% of their initial efficiencies after aging for 2000 h under the ambient conditions (25&#160;&#176;C, relative humidity: 35&#8211;45%) and a nitrogen atmosphere with heating at 65&#160;&#176;C, respectively.

&lt;p&gt;A dual-interface modulation strategy is demonstrated using functional covalent organic frameworks to fabricate the high-performance perovskite solar cells; a champion efficiency of 24.26% is obtained together with enhanced long-term stability due to released tensile stress, reduced trap state density, as well as enhanced resistance of humidity and ultraviolet irradiation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dual-interface modulation including buried interface as well as the top surface has recently been proven to be crucial for obtaining high photovoltaic performance in lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, for the first time, the strategy of using functional covalent organic frameworks (COFs), namely HS-COFs for dual-interface modulation, is reported to further understand its intrinsic mechanisms in optimizing the bottom and top surfaces. Specifically, the buried HS-COFs layer can enhance the resistance against ultraviolet radiation, and more importantly, release the tensile strain, which is beneficial for enhancing device stability and improving the order of perovskite crystal growth. Furthermore, the detailed characterization results reveal that the HS-COFs on the top surface can effectively passivate the surface defects and suppress non-radiation recombination, as well as optimize the crystallization and growth of the perovskite film. Benefiting from the synergistic effects, the dual-interface modified devices deliver champion efficiencies of 24.26% and 21.30% for 0.0725 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-sized devices, respectively. Moreover, they retain 88% and 84% of their initial efficiencies after aging for 2000 h under the ambient conditions (25&#160;&#176;C, relative humidity: 35&#8211;45%) and a nitrogen atmosphere with heating at 65&#160;&#176;C, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>M2 Macrophage Hybrid Membrane&#8208;Camouflaged Targeted Biomimetic Nanosomes to Reprogram Inflammatory Microenvironment for Enhanced Enzyme&#8208;Thermo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>

Excessive inflammatory reactions caused by uric acid deposition are the key factor leading to gout. However, clinical medications cannot simultaneously remove uric acid and eliminate inflammation. An M2 macrophage&#8208;erythrocyte hybrid membrane&#8208;camouflaged biomimetic nanosized liposome is engineered to deliver targeted self&#8208;cascading bienzymes and an immunomodulator to reprogram the inflammatory microenvironment for enhanced enzyme&#8208;thermo&#8208;immunotherapy.








Abstract
Excessive inflammatory reactions caused by uric acid deposition are the key factor leading to gout. However, clinical medications cannot simultaneously remove uric acid and eliminate inflammation. An M2 macrophage&#8208;erythrocyte hybrid membrane&#8208;camouflaged biomimetic nanosized liposome (USM[H]L) is engineered to deliver targeted self&#8208;cascading bienzymes and immunomodulators to reprogram the inflammatory microenvironment in gouty rats. The cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coating endow nanosomes with good immune escape and lysosomal escape to achieve long circulation time and intracellular retention times. After being uptaken by inflammatory cells, synergistic enzyme&#8208;thermo&#8208;immunotherapies are achieved: uricase and nanozyme degraded uric acid and hydrogen peroxide, respectively; bienzymes improved the catalytic abilities of each other; nanozyme produced photothermal effects; and methotrexate has immunomodulatory and anti&#8208;inflammatory effects. The uric acid levels markedly decrease, and ankle swelling and claw curling are effectively alleviated. The levels of inflammatory cytokines and ROS decrease, while the anti&#8208;inflammatory cytokine levels increase. Proinflammatory M1 macrophages are reprogrammed to the anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 phenotype. Notably, the IgG and IgM levels in USM[H]L&#8208;treated rats decrease substantially, while uricase&#8208;treated rats show high immunogenicity. Proteomic analysis show that there are 898 downregulated and 725 upregulated differentially expressed proteins in USM[H]L&#8208;treated rats. The protein&#8208;protein interaction network indicates that the signaling pathways include the spliceosome, ribosome, purine metabolism, etc.

         <title>d&#8208;Orbital Electron Delocalization Realized by Axial Fe4C Atomic Clusters Delivers High&#8208;Performance Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C Catalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new deeper viewpoint for how to improve the intrinsic catalytic activity of single&#8208;atom catalysts is shown in this work. Axial Fe4C atomic clusters can provide strong electronic perturbation to Fe&#8211;N4 active centers, leading to the d&#8208;orbital electron delocalization of Fe and forming the Fe&#8211;pyrrolic N4 bond with high charge distribution compared with Fe and Fe3C atomic clusters. Moreover, unlike the previous studies, this research focuses more on the electron distribution of Fe&#8211;N structure, rather than Fe electronic structures.








Abstract
Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction&#160;(ORR) has been considered as the most promising nonprecious metal catalyst due to its comparable catalytic performance to Pt in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). The active centers of Fe&#8211;pyrrolic N4 have been proven to be extremely active for ORR. However, forming a stable Fe&#8211;pyrrolic N4 structure is a huge challenge. Here, a Cyan&#8208;Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst with Fe&#8211;pyrrolic N4 as the intrinsic active center is constructed with the help of axial Fe4C atomic clusters, which shows a half&#8208;wave potential of up to 0.836&#160;V (vs. RHE) in the acid environment. More remarkably, it delivers a high power density of 870 and 478&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 at 1.0&#160;bar in H2&#8211;O2 and H2&#8211;Air fuel cells, respectively. According to theoretical calculation and in situ spectroscopy, the axial Fe4C can provide strong electronic perturbation to Fe&#8211;N4 active centers, leading to the d&#8208;orbital electron delocalization of Fe and forming the Fe&#8211;pyrrolic N4 bond with high charge distribution, which stabilizes the Fe&#8211;pyrrolic N4 structure and optimizes the OH* adsorption during the catalytic process. This work proposes a new strategy to adjust the electronic structure of single&#8208;atom catalysts based on the strong interaction between single atoms and atomic clusters.

         <title>Managing Interfacial Charged Defects with Multiple Active Sited Macrocyclic Valinomycin for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The unavoidably positively and negatively charged defects at the interface between perovskite and electron transport layer (ETL) often lead to severe surface recombination and unfavorable energy level alignment in inverted perovskite solar cells (PerSCs). Inserting interlayers at this interface is an effective approach to eliminate charged defects. Herein, the macrocyclic molecule valinomycin (VM) with multiple active sites of &#8211;C = O, &#8211;NH, and &#8211;O&#8211; is employed as an interlayer at the perovskite/ETL contact to simultaneously eliminate positively and negatively charged defects. Combined with a series of theoretical calculations and experimental analyzes, we demonstrate that the &#8211;C = O and &#8211;O&#8211; groups in VM can immobilize the uncoordinated Pb2+ to manage the positively charged defect, and the formation of N&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;I hydrogen bonding could recompense the formamidine vacancies to eliminate the negatively charged defect. Besides, the VM interlayer induces a favorable downshift band bending at the perovskite/ETL interface, facilitating charge separation and boosting charge transfer. Thanks to the reduced charged defects and favorable energy level alignment, the fabricated inverted PerSC delivers an outstanding power conversion efficiency of 24.06% with excellent long&#8208;term ambient and thermal stability. This work demonstrates that managing charged defects via multiple functional groups and simultaneously regulating energy level alignment is a reliable strategy to boost the performance of PerSCs.

         <title>Negative Photo&#8208;Response Switching via Electron&#8208;Hole Recombination at The Type Iii Junction of MoTe2 Channel/SnS2 Top Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Extensive study on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) van der Waals heterojunctions has primarily focused on PN diodes for fast&#8208;switching photo&#8208;detection, while achieving the same from 2D channel phototransistors has been rare despite their other advantages. Here, we have designed a high&#8208;speed phototransistor featuring a type III junction between p&#8208;MoTe2 channel and n&#8208;SnS2 top layer. Our photo&#8208;detecting device operates with a basis of negative photo&#8208;response (NPR), which originates from the recombination of photo&#8208;excited electrons in n&#8208;SnS2 and accumulated holes in the p&#8208;MoTe2 channel. For the NPR to occur, high&#8208;energy photons capable of exciting SnS2 (band gap &#8764;2.2&#160;eV) have been found to be effective, because lower&#8208;energy photons simply penetrate the SnS2 top layer only to excite MoTe2, leading to normal positive photo&#8208;response (PPR) which is known to be slow due to the photo&#8208;gating effects. Our NPR transistor showcases 0.5&#160;ms&#8208;fast photo&#8208;responses and a high responsivity over 5000 A W&#8722;1. More essentially, such carrier recombination mechanism is clarified with three experimental evidences. The phototransistor is finally modified with Au contact on n&#8208;SnS2, to be a more practical device displaying voltage output. Three different photo&#8208;logic states under blue, near infra&#8208;red (NIR), and blue&#8208;NIR mixed photons are demonstrated using the voltage signals.

         <title>Humidity/Oxygen&#8208; Insensitive Organic Synaptic Transistors Based on Optical Radical Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
For most organic synaptic transistors based on the charge trapping effect, different atmosphere conditions would lead to significantly different device performance. Some devices even lost the synaptic responses under the vacuum or inert atmosphere. The stable device performance of these organic synaptic transistors under varied working environments with different humidity and oxygen level can be a challenge. Herein, we report a moisture&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;insensitive organic synaptic device based on the organic semiconductor and photoinitiator molecules. Unlike the widely reported charge trapping effect, we utilize the photo&#8208;induced free radical to realize the photo&#8208;synaptic performance. The resulting synaptic transistor displays typical excitatory post&#8208;synaptic current, paired&#8208;pulse facilitation, learning, and forgetting behaviors. Furthermore, the device exhibits decent and stable photo&#8208;synaptic performances under high humidity and vacuum conditions. This type of organic synaptic device also demonstrates high potential in ultraviolet B perception based on its environmental stability and broad ultraviolet detection capability. Finally, the contrast&#8208;enhanced capability of the device has been successfully validated by the single&#8208;layer&#8208;perceptron/double&#8208;layer network based Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology pattern recognition. This work could have important implications for the development of next&#8208;generation environment&#8208;stable organic synaptic devices and systems.

         <title>Achieving Superior Tensile Performance in Individual Metal&#8722;Organic Framework Crystals</title>

         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;crystal tetraphenylporphyrin&#8208;type metal&#8208;organic framework nanobelts are found to exhibit unprecedented mechanical properties beyond theoretical limits and the origins of these mechanical properties are revealed by simulations.








Abstract
Rapid advances in the engineering application prospects of metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF) materials necessitate an urgent in&#8208;depth understanding of their mechanical properties. This work demonstrates unprecedented recoverable elastic deformation of Ni&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrins (Ni&#8208;TCPP) MOF nanobelts with a tensile strain as high as 14%, and a projected yield strength&#8208;to&#8208;Young's modulus ratio exceeding the theoretical limit (&#8776;10%) for crystalline materials. Based on first&#8208;principles simulations, the observed behavior of MOF crystal can be attributed to the mechanical deformation induced conformation transition and the formation of helical configuration of dislocations under high stresses, arising from their organic ligand building blocks in the crystal structures. The investigations of the mechanical properties along with electromechanical properties demonstrate that MOF materials have exciting application potential for biomechanics integrated systems, flexible electronics, and nanoelectromechanical devices.

         <title>Microscale Imaging of Thermal Conductivity Suppression at Grain Boundaries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermal conductivity imaging via frequency&#8208;domain thermoreflectance enables the detection of localized microscale suppression in thermal conductivity at the grain boundaries of thermoelectric SnTe. By employing a Gibbs excess approach, a thermal boundary resistance is extracted from the images, establishing a correlation between misorientation angle and thermal resistance. These findings demonstrate the capability of thermal imaging in extracting structure&#8211;property relationships.








Abstract
Grain&#8208;boundary engineering is an effective strategy to tune the thermal conductivity of materials, leading to improved performance in thermoelectric, thermal&#8208;barrier coatings, and thermal management applications. Despite the central importance to thermal transport, a clear understanding of how grain boundaries modulate the microscale heat flow is missing, owing to the scarcity of local investigations. Here, thermal imaging of individual grain boundaries is demonstrated in thermoelectric SnTe via spatially resolved frequency&#8208;domain thermoreflectance. Measurements with microscale resolution reveal local suppressions in thermal conductivity at grain boundaries. Also, the grain&#8208;boundary thermal resistance &#8211; extracted by employing a Gibbs excess approach &#8211; is found to be correlated with the grain&#8208;boundary misorientation angle. Extracting thermal properties, including thermal boundary resistances, from microscale imaging can provide comprehensive understanding of how microstructure affects heat transport, crucially impacting the materials design of high&#8208;performance thermal&#8208;management and energy&#8208;conversion devices.

         <title>Inter&#8208;Shell Sliding in Individual Few&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes for Flexible Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Few&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (FWCNT) is composed of a few coaxial shells of CNTs with different diameters. The shells in one tube can slide relatively to each other under external forces, potentially leading to regulated electrical properties, which has never been explored due to experimental difficulties. In this work, w e studied the electromechanical response induced by inter&#8208;shell sliding of individual CNTs and revealed the linear electrical current variation for the first time. Based on centimeter&#8208;long FWCNTs grown through chemical vapor deposition, controllable and reversible inter&#8208;shell sliding w as realized while simultaneously recording the electrical current. Reversible and linear current variation with inter&#8208;shell sliding w as observed, which is in consistent with o ur proposed inter&#8208;shell tunneling model. Further, w e developed a silk fibroin&#8208;assisted transfer technique for long CNTs and realized the fabrication of FWCNT&#8208;based flexible devices. Tensile stress can be applied on the FWCNTs@silk film encapsulated in elastic silicone to induce inter&#8208;shell sliding and thus controlled electrical current, which w as demonstrated to serve as a new human&#8208;machine interface with high reliability. Besides, w e foresee that the electromechanical behaviors induced by inter&#8208;layer sliding in 1D nanotubes may also be extended to 2D layered materials, shedding new light on the fabrication of novel electronics.

         <title>Salt&#8208;Induced High&#8208;Density Vacancy&#8208;Rich Two&#8208;Dimensional MoS2&#160;for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Emerging non&#8208;noble metal two&#8208;dimensional catalysts, such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), hold great promise in hydrogen evolution reactions. To enhance the intrinsically low activity of the basal plane structures of MoS2, various phase, strain and defect engineering approaches have been proposed. Sulfur vacancy is recognized as a key type of defect that impacts the catalytic performance. Unfortunately, the method of introducing sulfur vacancies is limited and requires costly post&#8208;treatment processes. Here, we demonstrate a novel salt&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method for synthesizing ultra&#8208;high&#8208;density vacancy&#8208;rich 2H&#8208;MoS2, with a controllable sulfur vacancy density of up to 3.35 &#215; 1014 cm&#8722;2. Our approach involves pre&#8208;sprayed potassium chloride (KCl) promoter on the growth substrate. The generation of such defects is closely related to ion adsorption in the growth process, the unstable MoS2&#8208;K&#8208;H2O triggers the formation of sulfur vacancy during the subsequent transfer process. Our novel approach to directly implant high density S vacancies in MoS2 during growth is more controllable and nondestructive when compared to the traditional post&#8208;treatment methods. The vacancy&#8208;rich monolayer MoS2 exhibits exceptional catalytic activity based on the microcell measurements, with an overpotential of &#8764; 158.8&#160;mV (100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and a Tafel slope of 54.3&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 in 0.5&#160;M H2SO4 electrolyte. Our results indicate a promising opportunity for modulating pure sulfur vacancy defects in MoS2 using salt&#8208;assisted CVD growth. This approach represents a significant leap towards achieving better control over the catalytic performances of 2D materials.

Chiral nematic liquid crystals (N*&#8208;LCs) can tremendously amplify circular polarized luminescence (CPL) signals. Doped emissive N*&#8208;LCs have been substantially explored. However, their CPL performances still need to be improved, majorly due to the unsatisfying helical twisting power (HTP) of commonly used chiral fluorescent dopants. Chiral fluorescent helical polymers (CFHPs) have outstanding optical activity and CPL performance. The present contribution reports the first success in constructing emissive N*&#8208;LCs by doping CFHP into nematic liquid crystals (5CB, N&#8208;LCs). The helical assembly structures of N*&#8208;LCs effectively amplify CPL signals of the CFHP. Owing to the high HTP of CFHP, selective reflection band of N*&#8208;LC can be adjusted to fully cover its emission band. A nearly pure CPL with dissymmetry factor (glum) up to &#8211;1.87 is realized at 9 wt% doping concentration. Taking advantage of selective reflection mechanism, multi&#8208;color CPL&#8208;active N*&#8208;LCs with high glum are fabricated via further adding achiral fluorophores. Also noticeably, circularly polarized room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (CPRTP) with glum up to &#8211;1.57 is achieved. Anti&#8208;counterfeiting application is demonstrated exploiting multi&#8208;mode optical characteristics of the created N*&#8208;LCs. The established strategy for constructing emissive N*&#8208;LCs provides a platform for future exploring CPL&#8208;active N*&#8208;LCs.

         <title>Amphiphilic Cobalt Phthalocyanine Boosts Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Due to the easy accessibility, chemical stability and structural tunability of macrocyclic skeleton, cobalt phthalocyanines immobilized on carbon supports offer an ideal research model for advanced electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (eCO2RR). Herein, for the first time, an amphiphilic cobalt phthalocyanine (TC&#8208;CoPc) is loaded on multiwalled carbon nanotubes to unveral the roles of hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties on catalytic efficiency. To our surprise, the resultant electrode exhibits FECO of 95% for CO2RR with TOF of 29.4 s&#8722;1 at the overpotential of 0.585&#160;V over long&#8208;term electrolysis in H&#8208;type cell. In membrane electrode assembly device (MEA), the boosted transport of water vapor to catalyst layer slows down carbonate crystallization and enhances the stability of the electrode with FECO value of &gt; 99% over 27 hours at &#8722;0.25 A, which represents the best selectivity and stability among reported molecular catalysts in MEA devices. The amphiphilic cobalt phthalocyanine, which decreases interfacial charge and mass transfer resistance and maintains effective contact between active sites and the electrolyte, highlights the exceptional CO2 conversion from molecular perspective.

         <title>Color&#8208;Tunable, Excitation&#8208;Dependent, and Water Stimulus&#8208;Responsive Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Cellulose for Versatile Applications</title>

Abstract
Smart&#8208;response materials with ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are highly desirable, but they have rarely been described, especially those originating from sustainable polymers. Herein, a variety of cellulose derivatives with 1,4 dihydropyridines (DHPs) rings were synthesized through the Hantzsch reaction, giving impressive RTP with a long lifetime of up to 1251 ms. Specifically, the introduction of acetoacetyl groups and DHPs rings promotes the spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) and intersystem crossing (ISC) process, and multiple interactions between cellulose induce clustering and inhibit the nonradiative transitions, boosting long&#8208;live RTP. Furthermore, the resulting transparent and flexible cellulose films also exhibit excitation&#8208;dependent and color&#8208;tunable afterglows by introducing different extended aromatic groups. More interestingly, the RTP performance of these films is sensitive to water and can be repeated in response to wet/dry stimuli. Inspired by these advantages, the RTP cellulose demonstrates advanced applications in information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. This work not only enriches the photophysical properties of cellulose but also provides a versatile platform for the development of sustainable afterglows.

         <title>Less&#8208;Suture Vascular Anastomosis: Development of Alternative Protocols with Multifunctional Self&#8208;Wrapping, Transparent, Adhesive, and Elastic Biomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adhesive, hemostatic, transparent, and elastic films are developed in this study to be used in &#8220;less&#8208;suture anastomosis&#8221; for blood vessels. It extensively decreases the number of sutures for vascular anastomosis and overall surgical time to a life&#8208;saving level in both normal and coagulopathy animal models.








Abstract
Blood vessel anastomosis by suture is a life&#8208;saving, yet time&#8208;consuming and labor&#8208;intensive operation. While suture&#8208;less alternatives utilizing clips or related devices are developed to address these shortcomings, suture anastomosis is still overwhelmingly used in most cases. In this study, practical &#8220;less&#8208;suture&#8221; strategies are proposed, rather than ideal &#8220;suture&#8208;less&#8221; methods, to reflect real&#8208;world clinical situations. In the case of rat artery (d = 0.64&#160;mm) anastomosis, the less&#8208;suture anastomosis involves the application of thin, adhesive, transparent, and self&#8208;wrapping films to the site. This surprisingly reduces the number of stitches required from ten (without films) to four (with films), saving 27&#160;min of operating time per vessel. Furthermore, the decreased number of stitches largely alleviates fibrosis&#8208;mediated wall&#8208;thickening. Thus, a less&#8208;suture strategy is particularly useful for anastomosis of multiple vessels in emergency conditions and small&#8208;diameter vessels.

         <title>2D Ferroionics: Conductive Switching Mechanisms and Transition Boundaries in Van der Waals Layered Material CuInP2S6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A full 2D van der Waals heterostructure ferroelectric semimetal junction is fabricated to unravel the conductive mechanism of CuInP2S6, and a detailed phase diagram of the competing mechanisms and transition boundaries with temperature and an external electric field is presented. Based on this understanding, an artificial synapse with automatic gain control is also demonstrated.








Abstract
The recently unfolded ferroionic phenomena in 2D van der Waals (vdW) copper&#8211;indium&#8211;thiophosphate (CuInP2S6 or CIPS) have received widespread interest as they allow for dynamic control of conductive switching properties, which are appealing in the paradigm&#8208;shift computing. The intricate couplings between ferroelectric polarization and ionic conduction in 2D vdW CIPS facilitate the manipulation and dynamic control of conductive behaviors. However, the complex interplays and underlying mechanisms are not yet fully explored and understood. Here, by investigating polarization switching and ionic conduction in the temperature and applied electric field domains, it is discovered that the conducting mechanisms of CIPS can be divided into four distinctive states (or modes) with transitional boundaries, depending on the dynamics of Cu ions in the material. Further, it demonstrates that dynamically&#8208;tunable synaptic responsive behavior can be well implemented by governing the working&#8208;state transition. This research provides an in&#8208;depth, quantitative understanding of the complex phenomena of conductive switching in 2D vdW CIPS with coexisting ferroelectric order and ionic disorder. The developed insights in this work lay the ground for implementing high&#8208;performance, function&#8208;enriched devices for information processing, data storage, and neuromorphic computing based on the 2D ferroionic material systems.

         <title>Ultrafast Subpicosecond Magnetization of a 2D Ferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first sub&#8208;ps (&#8776;600&#160;fs) magnetization process in a ferromagnetic quantum well is successfully demonstrated, which utilizes the high carrier coherency and a rapid photo&#8208;Demba field effect, using pump&#8208;and&#8208;probe measurements with an X&#8208;ray free&#8208;electron laser. This hopefully opens a new way to ultrafast magnetic storage and information processing.








Abstract
Strong spin&#8208;charge interactions in several ferromagnets are expected to lead to subpicosecond (sub&#8208;ps) magnetization of the magnetic materials through control of the carrier characteristics via electrical means, which is essential for ultrafast spin&#8208;based electronic devices. Thus far, ultrafast control of magnetization has been realized by optically pumping a large number of carriers into the d or f orbitals of a ferromagnet; however, it is extremely challenging to implement by electrical gating. This work demonstrates a new method for sub&#8208;ps magnetization manipulation called wavefunction engineering, in which only the spatial distribution (wavefunction) of s (or p) electrons is controlled and no change is required in the total carrier density. Using&#160;a ferromagnetic semiconductor (FMS) (In,Fe)As quantum well (QW), instant enhancement, as fast as 600&#160;fs, of the magnetization is observed upon irradiating a femtosecond (fs) laser pulse. Theoretical&#160;analysis shows that the instant enhancement of the magnetization is induced when the 2D electron wavefunctions (WFs) in the FMS QW are rapidly moved by a photo&#8208;Dember electric field formed by an asymmetric distribution of the photocarriers.

&lt;p&gt;The first sub-ps (&#8776;600&#160;fs) magnetization process in a ferromagnetic quantum well is successfully demonstrated, which utilizes the high carrier coherency and a rapid photo-Demba field effect, using pump-and-probe measurements with an X-ray free-electron laser. This hopefully opens a new way to ultrafast magnetic storage and information processing.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong spin-charge interactions in several ferromagnets are expected to lead to subpicosecond (sub-ps) magnetization of the magnetic materials through control of the carrier characteristics via electrical means, which is essential for ultrafast spin-based electronic devices. Thus far, ultrafast control of magnetization has been realized by optically pumping a large number of carriers into the &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt; orbitals of a ferromagnet; however, it is extremely challenging to implement by electrical gating. This work demonstrates a new method for sub-ps magnetization manipulation called wavefunction engineering, in which only the spatial distribution (wavefunction) of s (or p) electrons is controlled and no change is required in the total carrier density. Using&#160;a ferromagnetic semiconductor (FMS) (In,Fe)As quantum well (QW), instant enhancement, as fast as 600&#160;fs, of the magnetization is observed upon irradiating a femtosecond (fs) laser pulse. Theoretical&#160;analysis shows that the instant enhancement of the magnetization is induced when the 2D electron wavefunctions (WFs) in the FMS QW are rapidly moved by a photo-Dember electric field formed by an asymmetric distribution of the photocarriers. Because this WF engineering method can be equivalently implemented by applying a gate electric field, these results open a new way to realize ultrafast magnetic storage and spin-based information processing in present electronic systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ferroelectric Switching at Symmetry&#8208;Broken Interfaces by Local Control of Dislocations Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelectric stacking order domains are observed in marginally twisted WS2. Using a scanning tunnelling microscope, reversible, local control of the domain walls is demonstrated at room temperature, and their evolution is understood with a theoretical model.








Abstract
Semiconducting ferroelectric materials with low energy polarization switching offer a platform for next&#8208;generation electronics such as ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistors. Recently discovered interfacial ferroelectricity in bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenide films provides an opportunity to combine the potential of semiconducting ferroelectrics with the design flexibility of 2D material devices. Here, local control of ferroelectric domains in a marginally twisted WS2 bilayer is demonstrated with a scanning tunneling microscope at room temperature, and their observed reversible evolution is understood using a string&#8208;like model of the domain wall network (DWN). Two characteristic regimes of DWN evolution are identified: (i) elastic bending of partial screw dislocations separating smaller domains with twin stackings due to mutual sliding of monolayers at domain boundaries and (ii) merging of primary domain walls into perfect screw dislocations, which become the seeds for the recovery of the initial domain structure upon reversing electric field. These results open the possibility to achieve full control over atomically thin semiconducting ferroelectric domains using local electric fields, which is a critical step towards their technological use.

         <title>Recent Advances and Challenges of Colloidal Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes for Display Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To guide the pathway toward the commercialization of quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs), representative research trends, progress, and challenges of QLEDs in the categories of material synthesis, device engineering, and fabrication methods are reviewed to specify the current status and development direction. Furthermore, brief insights into the factors to be considered when realizing active matrix QLED displays are provided.








Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) exhibit tremendous potential in display technologies owing to their unique optical properties, such as size&#8208;tunable emission wavelength, narrow spectral linewidth, and near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield. Significant efforts in academia and industry have achieved dramatic improvements in the performance of quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) over the past decade, primarily owing to the development of high&#8208;quality QDs and optimized device architectures. Moreover, sophisticated patterning processes have also been developed for QDs, which is an essential technique for their commercialization. As a result of these achievements, some QD&#8208;based display technologies, such as QD enhancement films and QD&#8208;organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, have been successfully commercialized, confirming the superiority of QDs in display technologies. However, despite these developments, the commercialization of QLEDs is yet to reach a threshold, requiring a leap forward in addressing challenges and related problems. Thus, representative research trends, progress, and challenges of QLEDs in the categories of material synthesis, device engineering, and fabrication method to specify the current status and development direction are reviewed. Furthermore, brief insights into the factors to be considered when conducting research on single&#8208;device QLEDs are provided to realize active matrix displays. This review guides the way toward the commercialization of QLEDs.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Redox Bicatalysis Batteries for Energy Storage and Chemical Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review article, the fundamentals and design principles of metal&#8208;redox bicatalysis battery (constructed by redox bifunctional catalyst cathode and metal anode) are summarized and proposed, and the effects of device structure and compositions are deeply discussed for energy storage and chemical production, which provides a design paradigm for new types of energy storage and conversion devices.








Abstract
New types of electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices based on redox electrocatalytic reactions possess great potential in renewable energy to maximize energy utilization and balance environmental issues. The typical device is the metal&#8208;redox bicatalysis battery, where the cathode is redox bifunctional catalyst&#160;(named as redox bicatalyst) with gas, solid, liquid as active reactants while anode is metal, driven by cathodic redox electrocatalytic reactions during charge/discharge processes, which promotes the energy storage and chemical production. In this system, the metal anode, redox&#8208;bicatalyst cathode, electrolytes, and the redox electrochemical reactions can be modified and adjusted to achieve the optimal energy conversion and utilization. Therefore, the deep understanding of the electrochemical system is conducive to designing new devices to meet the demand among various applications, including energy storage and conversion. In this review, the authors clarify the fundamentals and design principles of the rechargeable/reversible metal&#8208;redox bicatalysis batteries and how each part affects the devices in energy conversion and chemical production. The authors summarize the electrocatalytic reduction/oxidation reactions, the reported systems relied on redox reactions, and the corresponding redox bicatalysts. Finally, a perspective of the key challenges and the possible new types of metal&#8208;redox bicatalysis batteries for efficient energy utilization and chemical production are given.

         <title>Bacteria&#8208;Derived Outer&#8208;Membrane Vesicles Hitchhike Neutrophils to Enhance Ischemic Stroke Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoplatform based on bacteria&#8208;derived outer&#8208;membrane vesicle is developed for enhanced brain delivery of pioglitazone. It can be specifically recognized by neutrophils during blood circulation, subsequently hitchhiking on the neutrophils to cross the blood&#8208;brain barrier. The transcription factors Pou2f1 and Nrf1 of oligodendrocytes are identified for the first time to be involved in neural repair.








Abstract
The treatment of reperfusion injury after ischemic stroke remains unsatisfactory since the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) prevents most neuroprotective agents from entering the brain. Here, a strategy is proposed based on bacteria&#8208;derived outer&#8208;membrane vesicle (OMV) hitchhiking on the neutrophils for enhanced brain delivery of pioglitazone (PGZ) to treat ischemic stroke. By encapsulating PGZ into OMV, the resulting OMV@PGZ nanoparticles inherit the functions associated with the bacterial outer membrane, making them ideal decoys for neutrophil uptake. The results show that OMV@PGZ simultaneously inhibits the activation of nucleotide oligomerization&#8208;like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3)&#160;inflammasomes and ferroptosis and reduces the reperfusion injury to exert a neuroprotective effect. Notably, the transcription factors Pou2f1 and Nrf1 of oligodendrocytes are identified for the first time to be involved in this process and promoted neural repair by single&#8208;nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA&#8208;seq).

         <title>Enhanced Hot&#8208;Phonon Bottleneck Effect on Slowing Hot Carrier Cooling in Metal Halide Perovskite Quantum Dots with Alloyed A&#8208;Site</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controversies regarding the origins and mechanisms of A&#8208;site cation&#8208;dependent hot carrier relaxation dynamics are resolved by comparing the photogenerated carrier dynamics of 6 kinds of pure and mixed A&#8208;site cation halide perovskite quantum dots (i.e., FAPbI3, MAPbI3, CsPbI3, FA0.5MA0.5PbI3, FA0.5Cs0.5PbI3, MA0.5Cs0.5PbI3 PQDs) at various excitation intensities.








Abstract
A deep understanding of the effect of the A&#8208;site cation cross&#8208;exchange on the hot&#8208;carrier relaxation dynamics in perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) has profound implications on the further development of disruptive photovoltaic technologies. In this study, the hot carrier cooling kinetics of pure FAPbI3 (FA+, CH(NH2)2+),&#160;MAPbI3 (MA+, CH3NH3++), CsPbI3 (Cs+, Cesium) and alloyed FA0.5MA0.5PbI3, FA0.5Cs0.5PbI3, and MA0.5Cs0.5PbI3 QDs are investigated using ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy. The lifetimes of the initial fast cooling stage (&lt;1&#160;ps) of all the organic cation&#8208;containing PQDs are shorter than those of the CsPbI3 QDs, as verified by the electron&#8208;phonon coupling strength extracted from the temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence spectra. The lifetimes of the slow cooling stage of the alloyed PQDs are longer under illumination greater than 1 sun, which is ascribed to the introduction of co&#8208;vibrational optical phonon modes in the alloyed PQDs. This facilitated efficient acoustic phonon upconversion and enhanced the hot&#8208;phonon bottleneck effect, as demonstrated by first&#8208;principles calculations.

&lt;p&gt;The controversies regarding the origins and mechanisms of A-site cation-dependent hot carrier relaxation dynamics are resolved by comparing the photogenerated carrier dynamics of 6 kinds of pure and mixed A-site cation halide perovskite quantum dots (i.e., FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, MAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, FA&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;MA&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, FA&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Cs&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, MA&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Cs&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; PQDs) at various excitation intensities.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A deep understanding of the effect of the A-site cation cross-exchange on the hot-carrier relaxation dynamics in perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) has profound implications on the further development of disruptive photovoltaic technologies. In this study, the hot carrier cooling kinetics of pure FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (FA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, CH(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;),&#160;MAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (MA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;), CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cesium) and alloyed FA&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;MA&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, FA&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Cs&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and MA&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Cs&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; QDs are investigated using ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy. The lifetimes of the initial fast cooling stage (&amp;lt;1&#160;ps) of all the organic cation-containing PQDs are shorter than those of the CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; QDs, as verified by the electron-phonon coupling strength extracted from the temperature-dependent photoluminescence spectra. The lifetimes of the slow cooling stage of the alloyed PQDs are longer under illumination greater than 1 sun, which is ascribed to the introduction of co-vibrational optical phonon modes in the alloyed PQDs. This facilitated efficient acoustic phonon upconversion and enhanced the hot-phonon bottleneck effect, as demonstrated by first-principles calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Transmission Electron Microscopy for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the advances in the in situ transmission electron microscopy investigations on dynamic transformation and the corresponding morphological, structural, and chemical evolutions during the sodium storage process in the sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) including cathode materials, anode materials, and solid&#8208;electrolyte interface. This review aims to clarify the structure/composition&#8208;electrochemical performance relationship and to provide insights into the effective selection and rational design of advanced electrode materials for high&#8208;performance SIBs.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted tremendous attentions in recent years due to the abundance and wide distribution of Na resource on the earth. However, SIBs still face the critical issues of low energy density and unsatisfactory cyclic stability at present. The enhancement of electrochemical performance of SIBs depends on comprehensive and precise understanding of the underlying sodium storage mechanism. Although extensive transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations have been performed to reveal the sodium storage property and mechanism of SIBs, a dedicated review on the in situ TEM investigations of SIBs has not been reported. In this review, recent progress in the in situ TEM investigations on the morphological, structural, and chemical evolutions of cathode materials, anode materials, and solid&#8208;electrolyte interface during the sodium storage of SIBs is comprehensively summarized. The detailed relationship between structure/composition of electrode materials and electrochemical performance of SIBs has been clarified. This review aims to provide insights into the effective selection and rational design of advanced electrode materials for high&#8208;performance SIBs.

         <title>Robust PANI@MXene/GQDs&#8208;Based Fiber Fabric Electrodes via Microfluidic Wet&#8208;Fusing Spinning Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient microfluidic wet&#8208;fusing spinning chemistry (MWSC) method and in&#8208;situ growth process is developed to continuously fabricate high electrochemical performance and high mechanical strength MXene&#8208;based fiber fabrics (MFFs) with hierarchical architecture. This strategy has directive significance to the large&#8208;scale preparation of conductive fabric electrodes and provides a viable solution for the increasing demand of the portable microelectronic energy&#8208;storage devices.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional transition metal titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx) as a promising candidate material for batteries and supercapacitors has shown excellent electrochemical performance, but it is difficult to meet practical applications because of its poor morphology structure, low mechanical properties, and expensive process. Here, an applied and efficient method based on microfluidic wet&#8208;fusing spinning chemistry (MWSC) is proposed to construct hierarchical structure of MXene&#8208;based fiber fabrics (MFFs), allowing the availability of MFF electrodes with ultrastrong toughness, high conductivity, and easily machinable properties. First, a dot&#8208;sheet structure constructed by graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and MXene nanosheets with multianchor interaction in the microchannel of a microfluidic device enhances the mechanical strength of MXene fibers; next, the interfused fiber network structure of Ti3C2Tx/GQDs fabrics assembled by the MWSC process enhances the deformability of the whole fabrics; finally, the core&#8211;shell structure of PANI@Ti3C2Tx/GQDs architected by in&#8208;situ polymerization growth of polyaniline (PANI) nanofibers provides more ion&#8208;accessible pathways and sites for kinetic migration and ion accumulation. Through the morphology and microstructure design, this strategy has directive significance to the large&#8208;scale preparation of conductive fabric electrodes and provides a viable solution for simultaneously enhancing mechanical strength and electrochemical performance of conductive fabric electrodes.

         <title>Molecular One&#8208; and Two&#8208;Qubit Systems with Very Long Coherence Times</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Very long coherence times of up to 140 &#181;s are reported in perchlorotriphenylmethyl mono&#8208; and diradicals, strongly exceeding previous values. Furthermore, two&#8208;spin coherent manipulations are reported in the biradical systems, as a basic quantum gate operation. These results demonstrate the suitability of these compounds for molecular quantum architectures.








Abstract
General&#8208;purpose quantum computation and quantum simulation require multi&#8208;qubit architectures with precisely defined, robust interqubit interactions, coupled with local addressability. This is an unsolved challenge, primarily due to scalability issues. These issues often derive from poor control over interqubit interactions. Molecular systems are promising materials for the realization of large&#8208;scale quantum architectures, due to their high degree of positionability and the possibility to precisely tailor interqubit interactions. The simplest quantum architecture is the two&#8208;qubit system, with which quantum gate operations can be implemented. To be viable, a two&#8208;qubit system must possess long coherence times, the interqubit interaction must be well defined and the two qubits must also be addressable individually within the same quantum manipulation sequence. Here results are presented on the investigation of the spin dynamics of chlorinated triphenylmethyl organic radicals, in particular the perchlorotriphenylmethyl (PTM) radical, a mono&#8208;functionalized PTM, and a biradical PTM dimer. Extraordinarily long ensemble coherence times up to 148 &#181;s are found at all temperatures below 100&#160;K. Two&#8208;qubit and, importantly, individual qubit addressability in the biradical system are demonstrated. These results underline the potential of molecular materials for the development of quantum architectures.

         <title>Superflexible Artificial Soft Wood</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial soft wood (ASW) can be fabricated through the cork&#8208;inspired soft&#8208;in&#8208;rigid compositional strategy, taking advantage of freeze&#8208;casting rubber&#8208;in&#8208;resin emulsion. Thermal curing induces demulsification and phase inversion, leading to a superflexible wood&#8208;like material with discrete rigid islands in soft matrix. ASW exhibits wide&#8208;angle deformation capacity and high structural stability, achieving the trade&#8208;off in&#8208;between superflexibility and robustness.








Abstract
Soft woods have attracted enormous interest due to their anisotropic cellular microstructure and unique flexibility. The conventional wood&#8208;like materials are usually subject to the conflict between the superflexibility and robustness. Inspired by the synergistic compositions of soft suberin and rigid lignin of cork wood which has good flexibility and mechanical robustness, an artificial soft wood is reported by freeze&#8208;casting the soft&#8208;in&#8208;rigid (rubber&#8208;in&#8208;resin) emulsions, where the carboxy nitrile rubber confers softness and rigid melamine resin provides stiffness. The subsequent thermal curing induces micro&#8208;scale phase inversion and leads to a continuous soft phase strengthened by interspersed rigid ingredients. The unique configuration ensures crack resistance, structural robustness and superb flexibility, including wide&#8208;angle bending, twisting, and stretching abilities in various directions, as well as excellent fatigue resistance and high strength, overwhelming the natural soft wood and most wood&#8208;inspired materials. This superflexible artificial soft wood represents a promising substrate for bending&#8208;insensitive stress sensors.

         <title>A Stretchable Polymer Conductor Through the Mutual Plasticization Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly stretchable and conductive thin film electrodes are prepared by combing PEDOT:PSS with a mutually plasticized polyrotaxane dopant. Harsh acid&#8208;treatment for conductivity enhancement is avoided, and good solvent tolerance and high optical transparency are realized. The transparent electrochromic display that can bear stretching up to 80% strain is further developed, demonstrating its promising application in next&#8208;generation optoelectronics.








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable conductors play key roles in the dynamic interfacing of electronic devices with soft human tissues. However, it is difficult to simultaneously achieve high electrical conductivity and mechanical stretchability. Here, highly stretchable and conductive thin film electrodes are prepared by combining PEDOT:PSS and a mutually plasticized polymer dopant. Notably, harsh acid treatment for conductivity enhancement is avoided, and good solvent tolerance and high optical transparency are realized, all of which are essential to device fabrication. A transparent electrochromic display is further developed that can bear stretching up to 80% strain, demonstrating its promising application in next&#8208;generation optoelectronics.

         <title>Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett&#8208;Mediated Formation of Antibacterial Microneedles for Long&#8208;Term Transdermal Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antibacterial microneedles are developed via a simple strategy by depositing antibacterial nanoparticles of various shapes, sizes, and compositions onto microneedles for risk reduction of microneedle&#8208;induced skin infection with long&#8208;term transdermal administration. This functional nanoparticle coating strategy, which features controlled coating layers, uniform and high coverage, and simplicity of fabrication, provides a versatile platform for the expansion of microneedle applications.








Abstract
Microneedles (MNs) have become versatile platforms for minimally invasive transdermal drug delivery devices. However, there are concerns about MN&#8208;induced skin infections with long&#8208;term transdermal administration. Using the Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett (LB) technique, a simple method for depositing antibacterial nanoparticles of various shapes, sizes, and compositions onto MNs is developed. This strategy has merits over conventional dip coating techniques, including controlled coating layers, uniform and high coverage, and a straightforward fabrication process. This provides MNs with a fast&#8208;acting and long&#8208;lasting antibacterial effect. This&#160;study demonstrates that antibacterial MNs achieve superior bacterial elimination in vitro and in vivo without sacrificing payload capacity, drug release, or mechanical strength. It is&#160;believed that such a functional nanoparticle coating technique offers a platform for the expansion of MNs function, especially in long&#8208;term transdermal drug delivery fields.

         <title>Effective Modulation of Inflammation and Oxidative Stress for Enhanced Regeneration of Intervertebral Discs Using 3D Porous Hybrid Protein Nanoscaffold</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effective modulation of inflammation requires sustainable and dynamic blockades of diverse inflammatory mediators. A 3D porous hybrid protein nanoscaffold&#8208;based therapeutic strategy is developed to inhibit pro&#8208;inflammatory reactive oxygen species, cf nucleic acids, and regulate epigenetics in immune cells. This strategy robustly suppresses inflammation in vivo, promotes tissue regeneration, and reduces pain signaling after intervertebral disc injuries.








Abstract
Degeneration of fibrocartilaginous tissues is often associated with complex pro&#8208;inflammatory factors. These include reactive oxygen species (ROS), cell&#8208;free nucleic acids (cf&#8208;NAs), and epigenetic changes in immune cells. To effectively control this complex inflammatory signaling, it developed an all&#8208;in&#8208;one nanoscaffold&#8208;based 3D porous hybrid protein (3D&#8208;PHP) self&#8208;therapeutic strategy for treating intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration. The 3D&#8208;PHP nanoscaffold is synthesized by introducing a novel nanomaterial&#8208;templated protein assembly (NTPA) strategy. 3D&#8208;PHP nanoscaffolds that avoid covalent modification of proteins demonstrate inflammatory stimuli&#8208;responsive drug release, disc&#8208;mimetic stiffness, and excellent biodegradability. Enzyme&#8208;like 2D nanosheets incorporated into nanoscaffolds further enabled robust scavenging of ROS and cf&#8208;NAs, reducing inflammation and enhancing the survival of disc cells under inflammatory stress in vitro. Implantation of 3D&#8208;PHP nanoscaffolds loaded with bromodomain extraterminal inhibitor (BETi) into a rat nucleotomy disc injury model effectively suppressed inflammation in vivo, thus promoting restoration of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The resulting regeneration of disc tissue facilitated long&#8208;term pain reduction. Therefore, self&#8208;therapeutic and epigenetic modulator&#8208;encapsulated hybrid protein nanoscaffold shows great promise as a novel approach to restore dysregulated inflammatory signaling and treat degenerative fibrocartilaginous diseases, including disc injuries, providing hope and relief to patients worldwide.

         <title>Flagella of Tumor&#8208;Targeting Bacteria Trigger Local Hemorrhage to Reprogram Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages for Improved Antitumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor&#8208;specific and persistent hemorrhage is induced by flagella of tumor&#8208;targeting multiflagellate bacteria. The erythrophagocytosis of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) can increase intracellular heme accumulation. Artesunate forms a complex by specifically combining with heme to generate reactive oxygen species, which can enhance the pro&#8208;inflammatory polarization of TAMs and remodel tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment to improve antitumor therapy.








Abstract
Tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) exhibit an immunosuppressive M2 phenotype and lead to failure of antitumor therapy. Infiltrated erythrocytes during hemorrhage are recognized as a promising strategy for polarizing TAMs. However, novel materials that precisely induce tumor hemorrhage without affecting normal coagulation still face challenges. Here, tumor&#8208;targeting bacteria (flhDC VNP) are genetically constructed to realize precise tumor hemorrhage. FlhDC VNP colonizes the tumor and overexpresses flagella during proliferation. The flagella promote the expression of tumor necrosis factor &#945;, which induces local tumor hemorrhage. Infiltrated erythrocytes during the hemorrhage temporarily polarize macrophages to the M1 subtype. In the presence of artesunate, this short&#8208;lived polarization is transformed into a sustained polarization because artesunate and heme form a complex that continuously produces reactive oxygen species. Therefore, the flagella of active tumor&#8208;targeting bacteria may open up new strategies for reprogramming TAMs and improving antitumor therapy.

         <title>Tailoring the Amphiphilic Structure of Zwitterionic AIE Photosensitizers to Boost Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A philosophy of balanced hydrophobicity&#8211;hydrophilicity is proposed to design aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizers for promoting antitumor immunity. A membrane&#8208;targeted AIE photosensitizer called TPS&#8208;2 could induce cell death and membrane rupture by photodynamic therapy. Its aggregate size controllability promotes the release and delivery of antigens to boost in vivo antitumor immunity with only one dose of vaccination.








Abstract
Although photodynamic therapy (PDT) for thorough cancer treatment is hindered by the limited generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with short lifetime from photosensitizers, PDT&#8208;induced antitumor immune response remedies the defects. Previous studies show that inducing immunogenic cell deaths is an attractive approach to activate antitumor immunity, which confers a robust adjuvanticity to dying cancer cells. In this work, amphiphilic luminogens with aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics (AIEgens) are rationally designed and synthesized. By modulating the hydrophobic &#960;&#8208;bridge and zwitterionic functional groups, these AIEgens exhibit tunable organelle specificity to lysosome, endoplasmic reticulum, and plasma membrane and enhance ROS generation ability. Notably, the membrane&#8208;targeting AIEgen namely TPS&#8208;2 induces cell death and membrane rupture via PDT to facilitate the release of antigens and activation of immune cells. Furthermore, the size&#8208;controlled TPS&#8208;2 nanoaggregates are found to serve as an adjuvant, promoting antigen accumulation and delivery to sufficiently boost the in vivo antitumor immunity by only one dose injection in a prophylactic tumor vaccination model. This work thus provides new insights into optimizing AIE photosensitizers via a hydrophobicity&#8211;hydrophilicity balance strategy for evoking an antitumor immunity and directly suppressing the distanced tumor. A single small&#8208;molecular system for PDT&#8208;stimulated antitumor immunity is envisioned.

         <title>Folding Double&#8208;Stranded DNA into Designed Shapes with Triplex&#8208;Forming Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double&#8208;stranded DNA is cooperatively compacted into designed shapes by triplex&#8208;forming oligonucleotides, which bridge multiple normal or reverse Hoogsteen recognition domains. Hoogsteen&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly is highly programmable, methodologically straightforward, and yields large uniquely addressable nanostructures at low&#8208;cost. Moreover, the presented &#8220;triplex origami&#8221; method enables unprecedented spatial control over dsDNA templates not achievable by other artificial methodologies.








Abstract
The compaction and organization of genomic DNA is a central mechanism in eukaryotic cells, but engineered architectural control over double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) is notably challenging. Here, long dsDNA templates are folded into designed shapes via triplex&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly. Triplex&#8208;forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) bind purines in dsDNA via normal or reverse Hoogsteen interactions. In the triplex origami methodology, these non&#8208;canonical interactions are programmed to compact dsDNA (linear or plasmid) into well&#8208;defined objects, which demonstrate a variety of structural features: hollow and raster&#8208;filled, single&#8208; and multi&#8208;layered, with custom curvatures and geometries, and featuring lattice&#8208;free, square&#8208;, or honeycomb&#8208;pleated internal arrangements. Surprisingly, the length of integrated and free&#8208;standing dsDNA loops can be modulated with near&#8208;perfect efficiency; from hundreds down to only six bp (2&#160;nm). The inherent rigidity of dsDNA promotes structural robustness and non&#8208;periodic structures of almost 25.000&#160;nt are therefore formed with fewer unique starting materials, compared to other DNA&#8208;based self&#8208;assembly methods. Densely triplexed structures also resist degradation by DNase I. Triplex&#8208;mediated dsDNA folding is methodologically straightforward and orthogonal to Watson&#8208;Crick&#8208;based methods. Moreover, it enables unprecedented spatial control over dsDNA templates.

         <title>Bioinspired Luminescent HOF&#8208;Based Foam as Ultrafast and Ultrasensitive Pressure and Acoustic Bimodal Sensor for Human&#8211;Machine Interactive Object and Information Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent HOF&#8208;based foam is utilized as a pressure&#8208;acoustic bimodal sensor, which exhibits great sensitivity and a fast response time in pressure and sound sensing processes. The sensing mechanisms toward pressure and auditory are analyzed in detail by finite element simulation. The pressure&#8208;acoustic bimodal sensor is applied for object and word information recognition by human&#8211;machine interaction.








Abstract
Bionic sensors have extensively served smart robots, medical equipment, and flexible wearable devices. The luminescent pressure&#8208;acoustic bimodal sensor can be treated as a remarkable, multifunctional, integrated bionic device. Here, a blue&#8208;emitting hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF&#8208;TTA) as luminogen combines with melamine foam (MF), generating the flexible and elastic HOF&#8208;TTA@MF (1 and 2) as a pressure&#8211;auditory bimodal sensor. In the luminescent pressure sensing process, 1 has excellent maximum sensitivity (132.02&#160;kPa&#8722;1), low minimum detection limit (0.0&#8239;1333&#160;Pa), fast response time (20&#160;ms), high precision and great recyclability. 2 as a luminescent auditory sensor exhibits the highest response to the 520&#160;Hz sound at 255&#8722;1453&#160;Hz. In the process of sensing sound at 520&#160;Hz, 2 possesses high sensitivity (1&#8239;648&#8239;441.3&#160;cps&#160;Pa&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2), low detection limit (0.36&#160;dB) and ultrafast response time (10&#160;ms) within 11.47&#8722;91.77&#160;dB. The sensing mechanisms toward pressure and auditory are analyzed in detail by finite element simulation. Furthermore, 1 and 2, as a human&#8211;machine interactive bimodal sensor, can recognize nine different objects and word information of &#8220;Health&#8221;, &#8220;Phone&#8221;, and &#8220;TongJi&#8221; with high accuracy and strong robustness. This work provides a facile fabricated method of luminescent HOF&#8208;based pressure&#8211;auditory bimodal sensors and endows them with new recognition functions and dimensions.

         <title>Probing Optical Multi&#8208;Level Memory Effects in Single Core&#8208;Shell Quantum Dots and Application Through 2D&#8211;0D Hybrid Inverters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using CdSe/ZnS core/shell quantum dots (QDs), for the first time a 2D&#8211;0D hybrid&#8208;based optical multi&#8208;level memory (OMM) effect is observed. The OMM devices show that a single QD has the ability to maintain different memory levels. Based on the phenomenon, an OMM inverter consisting of two 2D&#8211;0D hybrid OMM devices is proposed to implement programming and erasing with laser pulses only. Finally, using a convolutional neural network composed of the OMM inverter set, the feasibility of applying the inverters as synapses is evaluated in a fully optically&#8208;controlled intelligent system via training and inference tasks using the CIFAR&#8208;10 dataset.








Abstract
Challenges in the development of a multi&#8208;level memory (MM)&#160;device for multinary arithmetic computers have posed an obstacle to low&#8208;power, ultra&#8208;high&#8208;speed operation. For the effective transfer of a huge amount of data between arithmetic and storage devices, optical communication technology represents a compelling solution. Here, by replicating a floating gate architecture with CdSe/ZnS type&#8208;I core/shell quantum dots (QDs), a 2D&#8211;0D hybrid optical multi&#8208;level memory (OMM) device operated is demonstrated by laser pulses. In the device, laser pulses create linear optically trapped currents with MM characteristics, while conversely, voltage pulses reset all the trapped currents at once. Assuming electron transfer via the energy band alignment between MoS2 and CdSe, the study also establishes the mechanism of the OMM effect. Analysis of the designed device led to a new hypothesis that charge transfer is difficult for laterally adjacent QDs facing a double ZnS shell, which is tested by separately stimulating different positions on the 2D&#8211;0D hybrid structure with finely focused laser pulses. Results indicate that each laser pulse induced independent MM characteristics in the 2D&#8211;0D hybrid architecture. Based on this phenomenon,&#160;we&#160;propose a MM inverter to produce MM effects, such as programming and erasing, solely through the use of laser pulses. Finally, the feasibility of a fully optically&#8208;controlled intelligent system based on the proposed OMM inverters is evaluated through a CIFAR&#8208;10 pattern recognition task using a convolutional neural network.

         <title>Suppression of Interphase Dissolution via Solvent Molecule Tuning for Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solvent molecule tuning is used to alter redox potentials of solvents or ion&#8208;solvent binding energy for high&#8208;voltage or low&#8208;temperature electrolyte. Herein, we propose an electrolyte design strategy that effectively suppresses solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) dissolution and passivates highly&#8208;reactive metallic Na anode via solvent molecule tuning. With rationally lengthened phosphate backbones with &#8211;CH2&#8211; units, the low&#8208;solvation tris(2&#8208;ethylhexyl) phosphate (TOP) molecule effectively weakens the solvation ability of carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes, reduces the free solvent ratio and enables an anion&#8208;enriched primary Na+ ion solvation sheath. The decreased free solvent and compact lower&#8208;solubility interphase established in this electrolyte prevent electrodes from the continuous SEI dissolution and parasitic reactions at both room temperature (RT) and high temperature (HT). As a result, the Na/Na3V2(PO4)3 cell with the new electrolyte achieves impressive cycling stability of 95.7% capacity retention after 1800 cycles at 25 &#176;C, and 62.1% capacity retention after 700 cycles at 60 &#176;C. Moreover, TOP molecule not only maintains the nonflammable feature of phosphate but also attains a higher thermal stability, which endows the electrolyte with high safety and thermal stability. Our design concept for electrolytes offers a promising path to long&#8208;cycling and high safe sodium metal batteries.

         <title>Cooperative Rheological State&#8208;Switching of Enzymatically&#8208;Driven Composites of Circular Dna And Dextran</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polymer topology, which plays a principal role in the rheology of polymeric fluids, and non&#8208;equilibrium materials, which exhibit time&#8208;varying rheological properties, are topics of intense investigation. Here, we push composites of circular DNA and dextran out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium via enzymatic digestion of DNA rings to linear fragments. Our time&#8208;resolved rheology measurements reveal discrete state&#8208;switching, with composites undergoing abrupt transitions between dissipative and elastic&#8208;like states. The gating time and lifetime of the elastic&#8208;like states, and the magnitude and sharpness of the transitions, are surprisingly decorrelated from digestion rates and non&#8208;monotonically depend on the DNA fraction. We model our results using sigmoidal two&#8208;state functions to show that bulk state&#8208;switching can arise from continuous molecular&#8208;level activity due to the necessity for cooperative percolation of entanglements to support macroscopic stresses. Our platform, coupling the tunability of topological composites with the power of enzymatic reactions, may be leveraged for diverse material applications from wound&#8208;healing to self&#8208;repairing infrastructure.

Here, we push composites of circular DNA and dextran out-of-equilibrium via enzymatic digestion of DNA rings to linear fragments. Our time-resolved rheology measurements reveal discrete state-switching, with composites undergoing abrupt transitions between dissipative and elastic-like states. The gating time and lifetime of the elastic-like states, and the magnitude and sharpness of the transitions, are surprisingly decorrelated from digestion rates and non-monotonically depend on the DNA fraction. We model our results using sigmoidal two-state functions to show that bulk state-switching can arise from continuous molecular-level activity due to the necessity for cooperative percolation of entanglements to support macroscopic stresses. Our platform, coupling the tunability of topological composites with the power of enzymatic reactions, may be leveraged for diverse material applications from wound-healing to self-repairing infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Unraveling The Coupling Effect Between Cathode And Anode Towards Practical Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The localized reaction heterogeneity of sulfur cathode and uneven Li deposition on Li anode are intractable issues for lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries under practical operations. Despite impressive progress in separately optimizing sulfur cathode or Li anode, it still lacks a comprehensive understanding of the highly coupled relationship between cathode and anode. Here, inspired by the Butler&#8208;Volmer equation, we identify a binary descriptor (IBD) assisting the rational structural design of sulfur cathode by simultaneously considering the mass transport index (Imass) and the charge transfer index (Icharge), and subsequently establish the relationship between IBD and the morphological evolution of Li anode. Guided by the IBD, we report a scalable electrode providing interpenetrated flow channels for efficient mass/charge transfer, full utilization of active sulfur, and mechanically elastic support for aggressive electrochemical reactions under practical conditions. These characteristics induce a homogenous distribution of local current densities and reduced reaction heterogeneity on both sides of the cathode and anode, which is confirmed by operando regional stress monitoring in pouch cells. Impressive energy density of 318&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 473&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 in an Ah&#8208;level pouch cell can be achieved by our design concept. This work offers a promising paradigm for unlocking the interaction between cathode and anode and designing high&#8208;energy practical Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Multifunctional Intelligent Wearable Devices Using Logical Circuits of Monolithic Gold Nanowires</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Although multifunctional wearable devices have been widely investigated for healthcare systems, augmented/virtual realities and telemedicines, there are few reports on multiple signal monitoring and logical signal processing by using one single nanomaterial without additional algorithms or rigid application&#8208;specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips. Here, we develop multifunctional intelligent wearable devices using monolithically patterned gold nanowires for both signal monitoring and processing. Gold bulk and hollow nanowires show distinctive electrical properties with high chemical stability and high stretchability. In accordance, the monolithically patterned gold nanowires can be used to fabricate the robust interfaces, programmable sensors, on&#8208;demand heating systems and strain&#8208;gated logical circuits. The stretchable sensors show high sensitivity for strain and temperature changes on the skin. Furthermore, the micro&#8208;wrinkle structures of gold nanowires exhibit the negative gauge factor, which can be used for strain&#8208;gated logical circuits. Taken together, this multifunctional intelligent wearable device would be harnessed as a promising platform for futuristic electronic and biomedical applications.

         <title>Embedding Living Cells with a Mechanically Reinforced and Functionally Programmable Hydrogel Fiber Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Living materials represent a new frontier in functional material design, integrating the synthetic biology tools to endow materials with programmable, dynamic and life&#8208;like characteristics. However, a major challenge in creating living materials is balancing the tradeoff between structural stability, mechanical performance, and functional programmability. To address this challenge, we propose a sheath&#8208;core living hydrogel fiber platform that synergistically integrates living bacteria with hydrogel fibers to achieve both functional diversity and structural and mechanical robustness. In the design, microfluidic spinning was used to produce hydrogel fiber, which offers advantages in both structural and functional designability due to their hierarchical porous architectures that can be tailored and their mechanical performance that can be enhanced through a variety of post&#8208;processing approaches. By introducing living bacteria, we endowed the platform with programmable functionality and life&#8208;like capabilities. This work reconstructed the genetic circuits of living bacteria to express chromoproteins and fluorescent proteins as two prototypes that enabled the coloration of living fibers and sensing water pollutants by monitoring the amount of fluorescent protein expressed. Altogether, this study established a structure&#8208;property&#8208;function optimized living hydrogel fiber platform, providing a new tool for accelerating the practical applications of the emerging living material system.

         <title>Permittivity&#8208;Based Microparticle Classification by the Integration of Impedance Cytometry and Microwave Resonators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Permittivity of microscopic particles can be used as a classification parameter for applications in materials and environmental sciences. However, directly measuring the permittivity of individual microparticles has proven to be challenging due to the convoluting effect of particle size on capacitive signals. To overcome this challenge, we built a sensing platform to independently obtain both the geometric and electric size of a particle, by combining impedance cytometry and microwave resonant sensing in a microfluidic chip. This way the microwave signal, which contains both permittivity and size effects, can be normalized by the size information provided by impedance cytometry to yield an intensive parameter that depends only on permittivity. The technique allowed us to differentiate between polystyrene and soda lime glass microparticles &#8212;below 22 microns in diameter&#8212; with more than 94% accuracy, despite their similar sizes and electrical characteristics. Furthermore, we show that the same technique can be used to differentiate between normal healthy cells and fixed cells of the same geometric size. The technique offers a potential route for targeted applications such as environmental monitoring of microplastic pollution or quality control in pharmaceutical industry.

         <title>Topological Flat Bands in Two&#8208;Dimensional Breathing&#8208;Kagome Lattice Nb3TeCl7</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Flat bands (FBs) can appear in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) geometrically frustrated systems caused by quantum destructive interference (QDI). However, the scarcity of pure 2D frustrated crystal structures in natural materials makes FBs hard to be identified, let alone modulate FBs relating to electronic properties. Here, the experimental evidence of the complete electronic QDI induced FB contributed by the 2D breathing&#8208;kagome layers of Nb atoms in Nb3TeCl7 (NTC) is reported. An identical chemical state and 2D localization characteristics of the Nb breathing&#8208;kagome layers are experimentally confirmed, based on which NTC is demonstrated to be a superior concrete candidate for the breathing&#8208;kagome tight&#8208;binding model. Furthermore, it theoretically establishes the tunable roles of the on&#8208;site energy over Nb sites on bandwidth, energy position, and topology of FBs in NTC. This work opens an avenue to manipulate FBs characteristics in these 4d transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based breathing&#8208;kagome materials.

         <title>Spatial Position Regulation of Cu Single Atom Site Realizes Efficient Nanozyme Photocatalytic Bactericidal Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Recently, single&#8208;atom nanozymes have made significant progress in the fields of sterilization and treatment, but their catalytic performance as substitutes for natural enzymes and drugs are far from satisfactory. Here, we report a method to improve enzyme activity by adjusting the spatial position of a single&#8208;atom site on the nanoplatforms. We synthesized two types of Cu single atom site nanozymes in the interlayer (CuL/PHI) and in&#8208;plane (CuP/PHI) of poly (heptazine imide) (PHI) through different synthesis pathways. Experimental and theoretical analysis indicates that the interlayer position of PHI can effectively adjust the coordination number, coordination bond length, and electronic structure of Cu single atoms compared to the in&#8208;plane position, thereby promoting photoinduced electron migration and O2 activation, enabling effective generate reactive oxygen species. Under visible light irradiation, the photocatalytic bactericidal activity of CuL/PHI against aureus was nearly 100%, achieving the same antibacterial effect as antibiotics, after 10 minutes of low&#8208;dose light exposure and 2 hours of incubation.

         <title>The Myth of &#8220;Metavalency&#8221; in Phase&#8208;Change Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unusual properties of phase&#8208;change materials have been related to the presence of a &#8220;unique,&#8221; &#8220;fundamentally different,&#8221; and &#8220;unconventional&#8221; bonding mechanism, &#8220;metavalency.&#8221; However, bonding in these materials involves just two types of covalent bond: two&#8208;center, two&#8208;electron (2c&#8208;2e) and electron&#8208;rich multicenter (3c&#8208;4e) bonds involving lone&#8208;pair electrons.








Abstract
Phase&#8208;change memory materials (PCMs) have unusual properties and important applications, and recent efforts to find improved materials have focused on their bonding mechanisms. &#8220;Metavalent bonding&#8221; or &#8220;metavalency,&#8221; intermediate between &#8220;metallic&#8221; and &#8220;covalent&#8221; bonding and comprising single&#8208;electron bonds, has been proposed as a fundamentally new mechanism that is relevant both here and for halide perovskite materials. However, it is shown that PCMs, which violate the octet rule, have two types of covalent bond: two&#8208;center, two&#8208;electron (2c&#8208;2e) bonds, and electron&#8208;rich, multicenter bonds (3c&#8208;4e bonds, hyperbonds) involving lone&#8208;pair electrons. The latter have bond orders less than one and are examples of the century&#8208;old concept of &#8220;partial&#8221;&#160;bonds.

         <title>Hairy&#8208;Skin&#8208;Adaptive Viscoelastic Dry Electrodes for Long&#8208;Term Electrophysiological Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hairy&#8208;skin&#8208;adaptive viscoelastic dry electrode (VDE) with semiflowable, adhesive, moldable, stretchable, self&#8208;healing, and recyclable properties is prepared. The VDE fills skin wrinkles, bypasses hair, and shields against hair disturbance and strain&#8208;related motion artifacts, achieving stable electrocardiography monitoring with intense chest expansion, electromyography monitoring at large strain, and convenient electroencephalography monitoring.








Abstract
Long&#8208;term epidermal electrophysiological (EP) monitoring is crucial for disease diagnosis and human&#8211;machine synergy. The human skin is covered with hair that grows at an average rate of 0.3&#160;mm per day. This impedes a stable contact between the skin and dry epidermal electrodes, resulting in motion artifacts during ultralong&#8208;term EP monitoring. Therefore, accurate and high&#8208;quality EP signal detection remains challenging. To address this issue, a new solution&#8212;the hairy&#8208;skin&#8208;adaptive viscoelastic dry electrode (VDE) is reported. This innovative technology is capable of bypassing hair and filling into the skin wrinkles, leading to long&#8208;lasting and stable interface impedance. The VDE maintains a stable interface impedance for a remarkable period of 48 days and 100 cycles. The VDE is highly effective in shielding against hair disturbances in electrocardiography (ECG) monitoring, even during intense chest expansion, and in electromyography (EMG) monitoring during large strain. Furthermore, the VDE is easily attachable to the skull without requiring any electroencephalogram (EEG) cap or bandage, making it an ideal solution for EEG monitoring. This work represents a substantial breakthrough in the field of EP monitoring, providing a solution for the previously challenging issue of monitoring human EP signals on hairy skin.

         <title>Slimming and Reinvigorating Tumor&#8208;Associated Dendritic Cells with Hierarchical Lipid Rewiring Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical lipid rewiring nanoparticles orchestrate the regulation of extracellular lipid uptake, cytoplasmic de novo lipid biosynthesis, and nuclear lipogenic gene transcription for metabolic reprogramming and slimming of tumor&#8208;associated dendritic cells (TADCs). These TADC&#8208;targeting nanoparticles reshape TADCs toward maturation, enhance TADC&#8208;mediated innate and adaptive immunity, and sensitize tumors to checkpoint blockade therapy.









Abstract
Dendritic cells (DCs) are crucial mediators of innate and adaptive antitumor immunity, whereas exogenously and endogenously driven lipid accumulation causes immune tolerance of tumor&#8208;associated DCs (TADCs) and thereby diminishes tumor responsiveness to various therapies. Herein, a type of multilevel lipid rewiring nanoparticles (NPs) for TADC revitalization is designed. These self&#8208;assembled NPs specifically bind to the lipid transport receptor Msr1 on the TADC surface and orchestrate the restriction of extracellular lipid uptake, cytoplasmic de novo lipid biosynthesis and nuclear lipogenic gene transcription. It is found that the slimming of TADCs via the three&#8208;in&#8208;one lipid metabolic reprogramming substantially promotes their maturation and rehabilitate their functions in inflammatory cytokine production, cytotoxic T cell recruitment, and tumor inhibition. Significantly, tumor resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy is further overcome. The study presents a non&#8208;canonical strategy to remodel tumor&#8208;infiltrating immune cells and paves a new path for improving the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>A&#160;Tumor&#8208;Microenvironment&#8208;Activatable Molecular Pro&#8208;Theranostic Agent for Photodynamic and Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fibroblast activation protein &#945; (FAP&#945;)&#8208;activatable pro&#8208;theranostic probe&#160;(FMP) has&#160;activated fluorescence and photoacoustic&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy immunotherapy for the simultaneous killing of cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and cancer cells. FMP&#8208;mediated immunotherapy can not only improve tumor immunogenicity, but also exhaust CAFs, promote cytotoxic T lymphocytes and aPD&#8208;L1 to enter the CAF&#8208;rich tumors, thus strengthening the synergistic antitumor immune response.








Abstract
Cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the major components of the tumor&#8208;associated matrix and play an important role in tumor progression and immunosuppression. Therefore, precise theranostics of CAFs are beneficial for CAFs&#8208;targeted therapies. However, imaging agents enabling precise theranostics of CAFs have been rarely exploited. To tackle this issue, a molecular pro&#8208;theranostic probe (FMP) with activatable fluorescence, photoacoustic (PA) imaging, and photodynamic therapy (PDT) is developed in response to fibroblast activation protein &#945; (FAP&#945;) overexpressed in &gt;90% types of CAFs and some tumor cells. Attributed to efficient activatable phototoxicity toward CAFs and tumor cells, together with activated immunogenic cell death (ICD), complete tumor regression of primary tumors and abscopal effect of distant tumors are observed in a 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice model. By integration with PD&#8208;L1 checkpoint blockade immunotherapy, enhanced systemic immune responses are evoked to obtain long&#8208;lasting tumor suppression of both primary and distant tumors as well as arrest systemic cancer metastasis in living mice.

         <title>Activatable Sonoafterglow Nanoprobes for T&#8208;Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Encompassing sonosensitizers, substrates, and quenchers, an ultrasound&#8208;induced afterglow imaging nanoprobe that can emit afterglow in deep&#8208;seated organs is presented. Only in response to granzyme B that is overexpressed by cytotoxic T cells, such a nanoprobe can be activated to emit sonoafterglow, permitting in vivo longitudinal monitoring of T&#8208;cell dysfunction in deep&#8208;seated autoimmune hepatitis after intravenous injection.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time imaging of immune systems benefits early diagnosis of disease and precision immunotherapy; however, most existing imaging probes either have &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; signals with poor correlation to immune responses, or rely on light excitation with limited imaging depth. In this work, an ultrasound&#8208;induced afterglow (sonoafterglow) nanoprobe is developed to specifically detect granzyme B for accurate imaging of T&#8208;cell immunoactivation in vivo. The sonoafterglow nanoprobe (Q&#8208;SNAP) consists of sonosensitizers, afterglow substrates, and quenchers. Upon ultrasound irradiation, sonosensitizers generate singlet oxygen, which converts substrates to high&#8208;energy dioxetane intermediates that slowly release energy after ultrasound cessation. Due to the proximity, energy from substrates can be transferred to quenchers, leading to afterglow quenching. Only in the presence of granzyme B,&#160;quenchers are liberated from Q&#8208;SNAP, resulting in bright afterglow emission with a limit of detection (LOD, 2.1&#160;nm) much lower than most existing fluorescent probes. Due to the deep&#8208;tissue&#8208;penetrating ultrasound, sonoafterglow can be induced through a tissue of 4&#160;cm thickness. Based on the correlation between sonoafterglow and granzyme B, Q&#8208;SNAP not only distinguishes autoimmune hepatitis from healthy liver as early as 4 h after probe injection, but also effectively monitors the cyclosporin&#8208;A&#8208;mediated reversal of T&#8208;cell hyperactivation. Q&#8208;SNAP thus offers the possibilities of dynamic monitoring of T&#8208;cell dysfunction and evaluation of prophylactic immunotherapy in deep&#8208;seated lesions.

&lt;p&gt;Encompassing sonosensitizers, substrates, and quenchers, an ultrasound-induced afterglow imaging nanoprobe that can emit afterglow in deep-seated organs is presented. Only in response to granzyme B that is overexpressed by cytotoxic T cells, such a nanoprobe can be activated to emit sonoafterglow, permitting in vivo longitudinal monitoring of T-cell dysfunction in deep-seated autoimmune hepatitis after intravenous injection.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real-time imaging of immune systems benefits early diagnosis of disease and precision immunotherapy; however, most existing imaging probes either have &#8220;always-on&#8221; signals with poor correlation to immune responses, or rely on light excitation with limited imaging depth. In this work, an ultrasound-induced afterglow (sonoafterglow) nanoprobe is developed to specifically detect granzyme B for accurate imaging of T-cell immunoactivation in vivo. The sonoafterglow nanoprobe (Q-SNAP) consists of sonosensitizers, afterglow substrates, and quenchers. Upon ultrasound irradiation, sonosensitizers generate singlet oxygen, which converts substrates to high-energy dioxetane intermediates that slowly release energy after ultrasound cessation. Due to the proximity, energy from substrates can be transferred to quenchers, leading to afterglow quenching. Only in the presence of granzyme B,&#160;quenchers are liberated from Q-SNAP, resulting in bright afterglow emission with a limit of detection (LOD, 2.1&#160;n&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;) much lower than most existing fluorescent probes. Due to the deep-tissue-penetrating ultrasound, sonoafterglow can be induced through a tissue of 4&#160;cm thickness. Based on the correlation between sonoafterglow and granzyme B, Q-SNAP not only distinguishes autoimmune hepatitis from healthy liver as early as 4 h after probe injection, but also effectively monitors the cyclosporin-A-mediated reversal of T-cell hyperactivation. Q-SNAP thus offers the possibilities of dynamic monitoring of T-cell dysfunction and evaluation of prophylactic immunotherapy in deep-seated lesions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Gate&#8208;Controlled Magnetotransport and Electrostatic Modulation of Magnetism in 2D Magnetic Semiconductor CrPS4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to its large bandwidth, we&#160;identify layered semiconducting antiferromagnet CrPS4 as an ideal candidate to realize field&#8208;effect transistors based on 2D magnetic materials. Low&#8208;temperature measurements exhibit a gate&#8208;tunable magnetoconductance exceeding 5000%, as well as the ability to continuously tune electrostatically the boundaries between different states in the magnetic phase diagram of the material.








Abstract
Using field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) to explore atomically thin magnetic semiconductors with transport measurements is difficult, because the very narrow bands of most 2D&#160;magnetic semiconductors cause carrier localization, preventing transistor operation. Here, it is shown that exfoliated layers of CrPS4&#8212;a 2D layered antiferromagnetic semiconductor whose bandwidth approaches 1&#160;eV&#8212;allow the realization of FETs that operate properly down to cryogenic temperature. Using these devices, conductance measurements as a function of temperature and magnetic field are performed to determine the full magnetic phase diagram, which includes a spin&#8208;flop and a spin&#8208;flip phase. The magnetoconductance, which&#160;depends strongly on gate voltage, is determined. reaching values as high as 5000% near the threshold for electron conduction. The gate voltage also allows the magnetic states to be tuned, despite the relatively large thickness of the CrPS4 multilayers employed in the study. The results show the need to employ 2D magnetic semiconductors with sufficiently large bandwidth to realize properly functioning transistors, and identify a candidate material to realize a fully gate&#8208;tunable half&#8208;metallic&#160;conductor.

         <title>Chloride&#8208;Based Additive Engineering for Efficient and Stable Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The key role of methylammonium chloride additive in directing the crystallization of 1.8&#160;eV perovskites to induce more effective halide homogenization is elucidated. The as&#8208;formed perovskite demonstrates suppressed halide segregation, improved optoelectronic properties, and ambient stability. In conjunction with a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (Me&#8208;4PACz), a VOC of 1.25&#160;V and steady&#8208;state PCE of 17% are achieved.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite based tandem solar cells are promising to achieve power conversion efficiency beyond the theoretical limit of their single&#8208;junction counterparts. However, overcoming the significant open&#8208;circuit voltage deficit present in wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells remains a major hurdle for realizing efficient and stable perovskite tandem cells. Here, a holistic approach to overcoming challenges in 1.8&#160;eV perovskite solar cells is reported by engineering the perovskite crystallization pathway by means of chloride additives. In conjunction with employing a self&#8208;assembled monolayer as the hole&#8208;transport layer, an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.25&#160;V and a power conversion efficiency of 17.0% are achieved. The key role of methylammonium chloride addition is elucidated in facilitating the growth of a chloride&#8208;rich intermediate phase that directs crystallization of the desired cubic perovskite phase and induces more effective halide homogenization. The as&#8208;formed 1.8&#160;eV perovskite demonstrates suppressed halide segregation and improved optoelectronic properties.

         <title>Trehalose&#8208;Guanosine Glycopolymer Hydrogels Direct Adaptive Glia Responses in CNS Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycopolymer&#8208;based supramolecular hydrogels are formulated by combining poly(trehalose&#8208;co&#8208;guanosine) (pTreGuo) glycopolymers with free guanosine (fGuo). Hydrogels with tunable microstructures and mechanical properties are produced through facile control of pTreGuo composition and fGuo concentration which alters G&#8208;quadruplex assembly. pTreGuo hydrogels direct adaptive glia repair responses after ischemic stroke to reduce the size of lesions and increase axon regrowth into lesion core environments.








Abstract
Neural tissue damaged after central nervous system (CNS) injury does not naturally regenerate but is instead replaced by non&#8208;neural fibrotic scar tissue that serves no neurological function. Scar&#8208;free repair to create a more permissive environment for regeneration requires altering the natural injury responses of glial cells. In this work, glycopolymer&#8208;based supramolecular hydrogels are synthesized to direct adaptive glia repair after CNS injury. Combining poly(trehalose&#8208;co&#8208;guanosine) (pTreGuo) glycopolymers with free guanosine (fGuo) generates shear&#8208;thinning hydrogels through stabilized formation of long&#8208;range G&#8208;quadruplex secondary structures. Hydrogels with smooth or granular microstructures and mechanical properties spanning three orders of magnitude are produced through facile control of pTreGuo hydrogel composition. Injection of pTreGuo hydrogels into healthy mouse brains elicits minimal stromal cell infiltration and peripherally derived inflammation that is comparable to a bioinert methyl cellulose benchmarking material. pTreGuo hydrogels alter astrocyte borders and recruit microglia to infiltrate and resorb the hydrogel bulk over 7&#160;d. Injections of pTreGuo hydrogels into ischemic stroke alter the natural responses of glial cells after injury to reduce the size of lesions and increase axon regrowth into lesion core environments. These results support the use of pTreGuo hydrogels as part of neural regeneration strategies to activate endogenous glia repair mechanisms.

         <title>Selective Methionine Pool Exhaustion Mediated by a Sequential Positioned MOF Nanotransformer for Intense Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sequential positioned metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanotransformer is designed to selectively exhaust the methionine pool via inhibiting the uptake of methionine and throttling its salvage pathway for enhanced cancer immunotherapy. The utilization of the MOF nanotransformer will motivate the development of novel and efficient antineoplastic platforms, offers a strategy for disturbing methionine homeostasis, and provides new insights into the treatments of other diseases.








Abstract
Cancer cells are addictive to exogenous methionine to gear toward tumor proliferation. Meanwhile, they can replenish methionine pool from polyamine metabolism through a methionine salvage pathway. However, the current developed therapeutic tactics for methionine depletion are still facing great challenges in terms of the selectivity, safety, and efficiency. Herein, a sequential positioned metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanotransformer is designed to selectively exhaust the methionine pool via inhibiting the uptake of methionine and throttling its salvage pathway for enhanced cancer immunotherapy. The MOF nanotransformer can restrain the open source and reduce the reflux of methionine to exhaust the methionine pool of cancer cells. Moreover, the intracellular traffic routes of the sequential positioned MOF nanotransformer match well with the distribution of polyamines, which is conducive to the oxidation of polyamines via its responsive deformability and nanozyme&#8208;augmented Fenton&#8208;like reaction for the final exhaustion of intracellular methionine. These results verify that the well&#8208;designed platform cannot only kill cancer cells efficiently but also promote the infiltration of CD8 and CD4 T cells for intensive cancer immunotherapy. Overall, it is believed that this work will inspire the construction of novel MOF&#8208;based antineoplastic platforms and provide new insights into the development of metabolic&#8208;related immunotherapy.

The MOF nanotransformer can restrain the open source and reduce the reflux of methionine to exhaust the methionine pool of cancer cells. Moreover, the intracellular traffic routes of the sequential positioned MOF nanotransformer match well with the distribution of polyamines, which is conducive to the oxidation of polyamines via its responsive deformability and nanozyme-augmented Fenton-like reaction for the final exhaustion of intracellular methionine. These results verify that the well-designed platform cannot only kill cancer cells efficiently but also promote the infiltration of CD8 and CD4 T cells for intensive cancer immunotherapy. Overall, it is believed that this work will inspire the construction of novel MOF-based antineoplastic platforms and provide new insights into the development of metabolic-related immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Reconstruction for Efficient and Stable Monolithic Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells with Greatly Suppressed Residual Strain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface reconstruction strategy is employed to achieve a strain&#8208;free perovskite film with simultaneously reduced defect density, suppressed ion migration, and improved energy level alignment. The resultant monolithic perovskite/black&#8208;silicon tandem realizes a certified stabilized efficiency &#8776;29.0%, which is among the best performances for perovskite/silicon tandems based on tunnel oxide passivated contacts.








Abstract
Despite the swift rise in power conversion efficiency (PCE) to more than 32%, the instability of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells is still one of the key obstacles to practical application and is closely related to the residual strain of perovskite films. Herein, a simple surface reconstruction strategy is developed to achieve a global incorporation of butylammonium cations at both surface and bulk grain boundaries by post&#8208;treating perovskite films with a mixture of N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide and n&#8208;butylammonium iodide in isopropanol solvent, enabling strain&#8208;free perovskite films with simultaneously reduced defect density, suppressed ion migration, and improved energy level alignment. As a result, the corresponding single&#8208;junction perovskite solar cells yield a champion PCE of 21.8%, while maintaining 100% and 81% of their initial PCEs without encapsulation after storage for over 2500&#160;h in N2 and 1800&#160;h in air, respectively. Remarkably, a certified stabilized PCE of 29.0% for the monolithic perovskite/silicon tandems based on tunnel oxide passivated contacts is further demonstrated. The unencapsulated tandem device retains 86.6% of its initial performance after 306 h at maximum power point (MPP) tracking under continuous xenon&#8208;lamp illumination without filtering ultraviolet light (in air, 20&#8211;35 &#176;C, 25&#8211;75%RH, most often &#8776;60%RH).

         <title>Gastrointestinal&#8208;Peristalsis&#8208;Inspired Hydrogel Actuators for NIR&#8208;Controlled Transport of Viscous Liquids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the gastrointestinal peristalsis of mammals to propel viscous chyme (viscosity up to 2000 mPa s), a new type of double&#8208;layered tubular liquid actuators is designed and demonstrated. Under the control of applied NIR light, highly viscous liquids ranging from &#8776;1000 mPa s to &gt;80&#160;000 mPa s can be efficiently propelled to move directionally.








Abstract
Liquid transportation is fundamentally important in microfluidics, water collection, biosensing, and printing, and has attracted enormous research interest in the past decades. However, despite substantial progress, it remains a big challenge to achieve the controlled transport of viscous liquids (&gt;100 mPa s) commonly existing in daily life and the chemical industry. Inspired by the gastrointestinal peristalsis of mammalians that can efficiently transport viscous chyme (viscosity up to 2000 mPa s) by the synergistic combination of contraction driving force and lubrication, here, the design and construction of double&#8208;layered tubular hydrogel actuators for directional transport of highly viscous liquids ranging from &#8776;1000 mPa s to &gt;80&#160;000 mPa s under the control of an applied 808&#160;nm laser, which is attributed to the cooperation of outer layer contraction and water film lubrication of the inner layer, is reported. It is demonstrated that the actuators are capable of transporting polymerizing liquid whose viscosity significantly increases to &#8776;11&#160;182 mPa s in 2&#160;h. This work paves a new avenue toward directional transport of highly viscous liquids, which not only expands the research scope of liquid transportation, but will spur the design of new liquid actuators with potential applications in viscous&#8208;liquid&#8208;based microfluidics, artificial blood vessels, and soft robots.

         <title>The Readiness of Water Molecules to Split into Hydrogen + Oxygen: A Proposed New Aspect of Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of dioxane to water leads to a significant blueshift in the frequency of the O&#63743;H stretch vibration derived from Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) experiments, which is indicative of increased O&#63743;H bond strength (intramolecular bonding). This phenomenon is accompanied by a significant increase in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) onset potential. Structural&#8211;molecular realities of H2O are hereby linked to a key parameter of water electrolysis.








Abstract
The potential of the anode, at which the evolution of oxygen begins, is a key parameter that describes how well water is split in water electrolyzers. Research efforts related to electrocatalytically initiated water splitting that aim at reducing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential to date focus on the optimization of materials used to produce the electrodes. Descriptors for the readiness of the H2O molecule itself to break down into its components have not been considered in water electrolysis experiments so far. In a simple set of experiments, it is found that adding dioxane to aqueous solutions leads to a substantial blueshift of the frequency of the O&#63743;H stretch vibration which is a sign of an increased strength of the O&#63743;H bond (intramolecular bonding). This phenomenon coincides with a significant increase in the OER onset potential as derived from cyclic voltammetry experiments. Thus, the O&#63743;H stretch frequency can be an ideal indicator for the readiness of water molecules to be split in its cleavage products. This is thought to be first example of a study into the relationship between structural features of water as derived from Fourier transform infrared&#160;(FTIR) spectroscopic studies and key results derived from water electrolysis experiments.

         <title>Energy Efficient Neuro&#8208;Inspired Phase&#8211;Change Memory Based on Ge4Sb6Te7 as a Novel Epitaxial Nanocomposite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel phase&#8208;change nanocomposite Ge4Sb6Te7 is reported to enable energy&#8208;efficient neuro&#8208;inspired phase&#8211;change memory (PCM). Ge4Sb6Te7 &#8208;based nanoscale PCM devices demonstrate multibit capability, low resistance drift, and bi&#8208;directional gradual resistance changes with &#8776;10&#215; resistance window using low energy (&#8776;1&#160;pJ) pulses; all facilitated by the unique microstructural and electro&#8211;thermal properties of Ge4Sb6Te7.








Abstract
Phase&#8208;change memory (PCM) is a promising candidate for neuro&#8208;inspired, data&#8208;intensive artificial intelligence applications, which relies on the physical attributes of PCM materials including gradual change of resistance states and multilevel operation with low resistance drift. However, achieving these attributes simultaneously remains a fundamental challenge for PCM materials such as Ge2Sb2Te5, the most commonly used material. Here bi&#8208;directional gradual resistance changes with &#8776;10&#215; resistance window using low energy pulses are demonstrated in nanoscale PCM devices based on Ge4Sb6Te7, a new phase&#8208;change nanocomposite material . These devices show 13 resistance levels with low resistance drift for the first 8 levels, a resistance on/off ratio of &#8776;1000, and low variability. These attributes are enabled by the unique microstructural and electro&#8208;thermal properties of Ge4Sb6Te7, a nanocomposite consisting of epitaxial SbTe nanoclusters within the Ge&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te matrix, and a higher crystallization but lower melting temperature than Ge2Sb2Te5. These results advance the pathway toward energy&#8208;efficient analog computing using PCM.

         <title>Probing the N&#233;el&#8208;Type Antiferromagnetic Order and Coherent Magnon&#8211;Exciton Coupling in Van Der Waals VPS3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#233;el&#8208;type AFM order of the VPS3 can break both spatial&#8208;inversion and time&#8208;reversal symmetries, which is verified by the magnetic&#8208;order&#8208;dependent second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG). Accordingly, The SHG intensity shows a close correlation with the N&#233;el&#8208;type magnetic order under varying temperatures, and an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin orientation can be further determined based on the specific six&#8208;fold symmetry.








Abstract
2D van der Waals (vdW) antiferromagnets have received intensive attention due to their terahertz resonance, multilevel magnetic&#8208;order states, and ultrafast spin dynamics. However, accurately identifying their magnetic configuration still remains a challenge owing to the lack of net magnetization and insensitivity to external fields. In this work, the N&#233;el&#8208;type antiferromagnetic (AFM) order in 2D antiferromagnet VPS3 with the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane anisotropy, which is demonstrated by the temperature&#8208;dependent spin&#8211;phonon coupling and second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG), is experimentally probed. This long&#8208;range AFM order even persists at the ultrathin limit. Furthermore, strong interlayer exciton&#8211;magnon coupling (EMC) upon the N&#233;el&#8208;type AFM order is detected based on the monolayer WSe2/VPS3 heterostructure, which induces an enhanced excitonic state and further certifies the N&#233;el&#8208;type AFM order of VPS3. The discovery provides optical routes as the novel platform to study 2D antiferromagnets and promotes their potential applications in magneto&#8208;optics and opto&#8208;spintronic devices.

         <title>Drycells: Cell&#8208;Suspension Micro Liquid Marbles for Single&#8208;Cell Picking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dry powder encapsulating single to several cells is formed by covering cell&#8208;suspension microdroplets with hydrophobic fumed silica nanoparticles. Owing to their suitability for mass production, high handling performance, and facile regulation of single&#8208;cell&#8208;level encapsulation, these proposed drycells can be used as a powerful cell&#8208;picking tool for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.









Abstract
Cell&#8208;picking technology is essential for cell culturing. Although the recently developed tools enable single&#8208;cell&#8208;level picking, they rely on special skills or additional devices. In this work, a dry powder that encapsulates single to several cells with a &gt;95% aqueous culture medium, thereby acting as a powerful cell&#8208;picking tool, is reported. The proposed &#8220;drycells&#8221; are formed by spraying a cell suspension onto a powder bed of hydrophobic fumed silica nanoparticles. The particles adsorb to the droplet surface and form a superhydrophobic shell, which prevents the drycells from coalescence. The number of encapsulated cells per drycell can be controlled by adjusting the drycell size and cell&#8208;suspension concentration. Moreover, it is possible to encapsulate a pair of normal or cancerous cells and create several cell colonies within a single drycell. A sieving process can be used to sort the drycells according to size. The size of the droplet can range from one to hundreds of micrometers. The drycells are sufficiently stiff to be collected using tweezers; however, centrifugation separates them into nanoparticles and cell&#8208;suspension layers, with the separated particles being recyclable. Various handling techniques, such as splitting coalescence and inner liquid replacement, can be used. It is believed that the application of the proposed drycells will greatly improve the accessibility and productivity of single&#8208;cell analysis.

         <title>Terpolymerization and Regioisomerization Strategy to Construct Efficient Terpolymer Donors Enabling High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two chlorine regioisomeric units are developed and incorporated into star polymer PM6 to achieve one of the most efficient polymer donors for organic solar cells. It is demonstrated that Cl&#8208;regioisomerization not only affects molecular coplanarity, crystallinity, and aggregation behavior, but also modulates electrostatic potential, donor&#8211;acceptor interaction, and phase&#8208;separation morphology, which are of great importance for device performance.








Abstract
Terpolymerization and regioisomerization strategies are combined to develop novel polymer donors to overcome the difficulty of improving organic solar cells (OSCs) performance. Two novel isomeric units, bis(2&#8208;hexyldecyl)&#8208;2,5&#8208;bis(4&#8208;chlorothiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;3,6&#8208;dicarboxylate (TTO) and bis(2&#8208;hexyldecyl) 2,5&#8208;bis(3&#8208;chlorothiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;3,6&#8208;dicarboxylate (TTI), are obtained and incorporated into the PM6 backbone via random copolymerization to form a series of terpolymers. Interestingly, it is found that different chlorine (Cl) substituent positions can significantly change the molecular planarity and electrostatic potential (ESP) owing to the steric hindrance effect of the heavy Cl atom, which leads to different molecular aggregation behaviors and miscibility between the donor and acceptor. The TTO unit features a higher number of multiple S&#183;&#183;&#183;O non&#8208;covalent interactions, more positive ESP, and fewer isomer structures than TTI. As a result, the terpolymer PM6&#8208;TTO&#8208;10 exhibits a much better molecular coplanarity, stronger crystallinity, more obvious aggregation behavior, and proper phase separation in the blend film, which are conducive to more efficient exciton dissociation and charge transfer. Consequently, the PM6&#8208;TTO&#8208;10:BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based OSCs achieve a champion power conversion efficiency of 18.37% with an outstanding fill factor of 79.97%, which are among the highest values reported for terpolymer&#8208;based OSCs. This work demonstrates that terpolymerization combined with Cl regioisomerization is an efficient approach for achieving high&#8208;performance polymer donors.

         <title>Enhancing Bioavailability of Fertilizer through an Amyloid&#8208;Like Protein Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biocompatible and biodegradable protein coating can enhance droplet deposition and adhesion on superhydrophobic plant leaves. This coating packaging with fertilizers through electrostatic and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions affords a top&#8208;level retention capability for fertilizers, which could further improve the bioavailability of fertilizers and reduce at least 30% fertilizer use in scale&#8208;up applications in agriculture.








Abstract
Foliar fertilization acts as a ubiquitous component of conventional crop production, which brings considerable economic and ecological costs. Due to droplets rebounding and splashing during spraying and rain erosion, low bioavailability of fertilizer results in severe environmental pollution. Contrary to conventional fertilizer formulations with polymers, surfactants, and organic reagents, a method of improving fertilizer bioavailability based on a biocompatible protein coating is presented herein. In this system, whey protein concentrate (WPC) can undergo amyloid&#8208;like aggregation after the reduction of its disulfide bond by the reducing agent tris(2&#8208;carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP). Such aggregation affords a fast formation of the optically transparent and colorless phase&#8208;transitioned WPC (PTW) coating at the solid/water interface, with robust interfacial adhesion stability. Upon packaging with fertilizers through electrostatic and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, such reliable interfacial adhesion thereby facilitates the effective deposition of fertilizers on superhydrophobic and hydrophobic leaf surfaces, with excellent adhesion stability. Based on practical farmland test, this work demonstrates that the application of PTW can significantly boost the bioavailability of fertilizers and decrease at least 30% fertilizer use in large&#8208;scale crop planting. This innovative strategy has the great potential to offer a transformative step forward in managing fertilizer contamination and overuse in future agriculture.

         <title>Brightened Bicomponent Perovskite Nanocomposite Based on F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer for Micro&#8208;LED Displays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bicomponent perovskite nanocomposite based on F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer realizes near 100% quantum yield under excitation of 460 nm blue light. Color gamut of 135.90% NTSC and 101.47% BT.2020 is achieved when the bicomponent perovskite nanocomposites, as color conversion materials, combine with a GaN micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting&#8208;diode (micro&#8208;LED) array.








Abstract
Lead halide perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) are&#160;making their way toward next&#8208;generation display applications, such as serving as color conversion layers in micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting&#8208;diode (micro&#8208;LED)&#160;arrays. Red PQDs containing iodine exhibit weaker brightness compared with their green counterpart when employed as color conversion layers. Therefore, PQDs with enhanced brightness are highly favorable for micro/mini&#8208;LED displays. A universal strategy of bicomponent perovskite nanocomposite (BPNC) with significantly enhanced photoluminescence (PL) intensity is proposed through the built&#8208;in F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the core CsPbBr3 to the shell &#947;&#8208;CsPbI3, and it is confirmed that it is through a pair of combined quasi&#8208;degenerate energy levels in the blue spectra region that the FRET is conducted, resulting in a high excitation wavelength selectivity. Owing to the highly efficient energy transition route from blue excitation to red emission established by the FRET, the BPNC exhibits the brightest single&#8208;peak red photoluminescence with near 100% quantum yield. The BPNC with FRET is further proven to be adaptable to a wide range of emission wavelengths. The BPNCs in a blue micro&#8208;LED array are employed as color downconversion layers, and excellent color conversion properties and high color gamut are demonstrated. This strategy of BPNC paves a road to the full&#8208;color micro&#8208;LED&#160;displays.

         <title>Sono&#8208;Driven STING Activation using Semiconducting Polymeric Nanoagonists for Precision Sono&#8208;Immunotherapy of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semiconducting polymeric nanoagonist (SPNM) is developed for in situ sono&#8208;driven STING activation to boost immunotherapy of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Upon sono&#8208;irradiation, SPNM produces singlet oxygen not only to induce immunogenic cell death but also to unleash caged STING agonists to trigger STING activation in situ, leading to enhanced systemic antitumor immunity.








Abstract
Immunotherapy has offered new opportunities to treat head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC); however, its clinical applications are hindered by modest therapeutic outcomes and the &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; pharmacological activity of immunomodulatory agents. Strategies for precise spatiotemporal activation of antitumor immunity can tackle these issues but remain challenging. Herein, a semiconducting polymeric nanoagonist (SPNM) with in situ sono&#8208;activatable immunotherapeutic effects for precision sono&#8208;immunotherapy of HNSCC is reported. SPNM is self&#8208;assembled from a sonodynamic semiconducting polymer core conjugated with a stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist (MSA&#8208;2) via a singlet oxygen cleavable linker. Under sono&#8208;irradiation, SPNM produces singlet oxygen not only to eradicate tumor cells to trigger immunogenic cell death but also to unleash caged STING agonists via the cleavage of diphenoxyethene bonds for in situ activation of the STING pathway in the tumor region. Such sono&#8208;driven STING activation mediated by SPNM promotes effector T cell infiltration and potentiates systemic antitumor immunity, eventually leading to tumor growth inhibition and long&#8208;term immunological memory. This study thus presents a promising strategy for the precise spatiotemporal activation of cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Transport Layer Engineering Toward Lower Threshold for Perovskite Lasers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effects of transport layers on perovskite lasing actions are investigated. It is find that a selected hole&#8208;transport layer (PTAA) can reduce the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) threshold of perovskite by suppressing hot&#8208;hole&#8208;induced Auger loss. An independent excitation&#8208;wavelength&#8208;influenced ASE threshold experiment further verifies the discovery.








Abstract
Charge&#8208;transport layers are essential for achieving electrically pumped perovskite lasers. However, their role in perovskite lasing is not fully understood. Here, the role of charge&#8208;transport layers on the lasing actions of perovskite films is explored by investigating the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) thresholds. A largely reduced ASE threshold and enhanced ASE intensity is demonstrated by introducing an additional hole transport layer poly(triaryl amine) (PTAA). It is shown that the key role of the PTAA layer is to accelerate the hot&#8208;carrier cooling process by extracting holes in perovskites. With reduced hot holes, the Auger recombination loss is largely suppressed, resulting in decreased ASE threshold. This argument is further supported by the fact that the ASE threshold can be further reduced from 25.7 to 7.2&#160;&#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2 upon switching the pumping wavelength from 400 to 500&#160;nm to directly avoid excess hot&#8208;hole generation. This work exemplifies how to further reduce the ASE threshold with transport layer engineering through hot&#8208;hole manipulation. This is critical to maintaining the excellent gain properties of perovskites when integrating them into electrical devices, paving the way for electrically pumped perovskite lasers.

         <title>Pancreatic Tumor&#8208;Targeting Stemsome Therapeutics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel tumor&#8208;targeting strategy using stem cells without knowing the surface target receptors of the cancer cells is demonstrated for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, one of the intractable tumors that currently have no successful clinical strategy. The suggested promising strategy is especially effective for the treatment of other intractable tumors.








Abstract
Owing to the intrinsic ability of stem cells to target the tumor environment, stem&#8208;cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;functionalized nanocarriers can target and load active anticancer drugs. In this work, a strategy that focuses on stem cells that self&#8208;target pancreatic cancer cells is developed. In particular, malignant deep tumors such as pancreatic cancer cells, one of the intractable tumors that currently have no successful clinical strategy, are available for targeting and destruction. By gaining the targeting ability of stem cells against pancreatic tumor cells, stem cell membranes can encapsulate nano&#8208;polylactide&#8208;co&#8208;glycolide loaded with doxorubicin to target and reduce deep pancreatic tumor tissues. Considering the lack of known target proteins on pancreatic tumor cells, the suggested platform technology can be utilized for targeting any malignant tumors in which surface target receptors are unavailable.

         <title>Covalently Functionalized Leakage&#8208;Free Healable Phase&#8208;Change Interface Materials with Extraordinary High&#8208;Thermal Conductivity and Low&#8208;Thermal Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalently functionalized leakage&#8208;free phase&#8208;change thermal interface material is synthesized. The hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;forming functional groups enable a nearly perfect healing efficiency and recyclability. Elaborately designed multiwalled carbon nanotubes decorated with silver nanoparticles bridge silver&#8208;flake islands, resulting in extraordinary high thermal conductivity (43.4&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1) and low total thermal resistance (30.5&#160;mm2&#160;K W&#8722;1) for phase&#8208;change thermal interface materials.








Abstract
Phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) have received considerable attention to take advantage of both pad&#8208;type and grease&#8208;type thermal interface materials (TIMs). However, the critical drawbacks of leaking, non&#8208;recyclability, and low thermal conductivity (&#954;) hinder industrial applications of PCM TIMs. Here, leakage&#8208;free healable PCM TIMs with extraordinarily high &#954; and low total thermal resistance (Rt) are reported. The matrix material (OP) is synthesized by covalently functionalizing octadecanol PCM with polyethylene&#8208;co&#8208;methyl acrylate&#8208;co&#8208;glycidyl methacrylate polymer through the nucleophilic epoxy ring opening reaction. The OP changes from semicrystalline to amorphous above the phase&#8208;transition temperature, preventing leaking. The hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;forming functional groups in OP enable nearly perfect healing efficiencies in tensile strength (99.7%), &#954; (97.0%), and Rt (97.4%). Elaborately designed thermally conductive fillers, silver&#160;flakes&#160;and multiwalled carbon nanotubes decorated with silver nanoparticles (nAgMWNTs), are additionally introduced in the OP matrix (OP&#8208;Ag&#8208;nAgMWNT).

&lt;p&gt;A covalently functionalized leakage-free phase-change thermal interface material is synthesized. The hydrogen-bond-forming functional groups enable a nearly perfect healing efficiency and recyclability. Elaborately designed multiwalled carbon nanotubes decorated with silver nanoparticles bridge silver-flake islands, resulting in extraordinary high thermal conductivity (43.4&#160;W&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and low total thermal resistance (30.5&#160;mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;K W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) for phase-change thermal interface materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phase-change materials (PCMs) have received considerable attention to take advantage of both pad-type and grease-type thermal interface materials (TIMs). However, the critical drawbacks of leaking, non-recyclability, and low thermal conductivity (&lt;i&gt;&#954;&lt;/i&gt;) hinder industrial applications of PCM TIMs. Here, leakage-free healable PCM TIMs with extraordinarily high &lt;i&gt;&#954;&lt;/i&gt; and low total thermal resistance (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;) are reported. The matrix material (OP) is synthesized by covalently functionalizing octadecanol PCM with polyethylene-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-methyl acrylate-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-glycidyl methacrylate polymer through the nucleophilic epoxy ring opening reaction. The OP changes from semicrystalline to amorphous above the phase-transition temperature, preventing leaking. The hydrogen-bond-forming functional groups in OP enable nearly perfect healing efficiencies in tensile strength (99.7%), &lt;i&gt;&#954;&lt;/i&gt; (97.0%), and &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; (97.4%). Elaborately designed thermally conductive fillers, silver&#160;flakes&#160;and multiwalled carbon nanotubes decorated with silver nanoparticles (nAgMWNTs), are additionally introduced in the OP matrix (OP-Ag-nAgMWNT). The nAgMWNTs bridge silver-flake islands, resulting in extraordinarily high &lt;i&gt;&#954;&lt;/i&gt; (43.4&#160;W&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and low &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; (30.5&#160;mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;K W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) compared with PCM TIMs in the literature. Excellent heat dissipation and recycling demonstration of the OP-Ag-nAgMWNT is also carried out using a computer graphic processing unit. The OP-Ag-nAgMWNT is a promising future TIM for thermal management of mechanical and electrical devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Defect&#8208;Rich MoSe2 2H/1T Hybrid Nanoparticles Prepared from Femtosecond Laser Ablation in Liquid and Their Enhanced Photothermal Conversion Efficiencies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two types of spherical MoSe2 2H/1T hybrid nanoparticles are formed by ablating MoSe2 powder in isopropyl alcohol with a femtosecond laser: onion&#8208;structured nanoparticles and polycrystalline nanoparticles. Different formation mechanisms are identified for the two types of nanoparticles and the spherical nanoparticles have high photothermal conversion efficiencies thanks to defects and structural disorder in the nanoparticles.








Abstract
MoSe2 2H/1T hybrid nanoparticles are prepared by femtosecond laser ablation of MoSe2 powder in isopropyl alcohol with different laser powers and ablation times, and their formation mechanisms and photothermal conversion efficiencies (PTCEs) are studied. Two types of spherical nanoparticles are observed. The first type is onion&#8208;structured nanoparticles that are formed by nucleation on the surfaces of melted droplets followed by inward growth of {002} planes of MoSe2. The second type is polycrystalline nanoparticles, formed by coalescence of crystalline nanoclusters fragmented from the powder during the laser ablation. The nanoparticle size in all samples shows a bimodal distribution, corresponding to different fragmentation mechanisms. The 2H&#8208;to&#8208;1T phase transition in the nanoparticles is likely caused by electron doping from the laser&#8208;induced plasma. The PTCEs of the nanoparticles increase with laser power and ablation time; the highest PTCE is around 38%. After examining the bandgaps and the Urbach energies of the nanoparticles, it is found that the high PTCEs are primarily attributed to defects and structural disorder in the laser&#8208;synthesized nanoparticles, which allow absorption of photons with energies smaller than the bandgap energy and facilitate non&#8208;radiative recombination of photoexcited carriers.

         <title>An Ion&#8208;Channel&#8208;Restructured Zwitterionic Covalent Organic Framework Solid Electrolyte for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A zwitterionic covalent organic framework (Zwitt&#8208;COF) is developed as a solid electrolyte for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries. The Zwitt&#8208;COF solid electrolyte exhibits a high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity with a wide electrochemical window, leading to superior long&#8208;term cycle performance in the battery. Theoretical simulations reveal that Zwitt&#8208;COF promotes the dissociation of Li&#8208;ion pairs and provides ion channels for effective Li+ transport.








Abstract
Organic solid electrolytes offer an effective route for safe and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries. However, it remains a challenge to devise a new strategy to promote the dissociation of strong ion pairs and the transport of ionic components in organic solid electrolytes. Herein, a zwitterionic covalent organic framework (Zwitt&#8208;COF) with well&#8208;defined chemical and pore structures is prepared as a solid electrolyte capable of accelerating the dissociation and transport of Li ions. The Zwitt&#8208;COF solid electrolyte exhibits a high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 1.65&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 with a wide electrochemical stability window. Besides, the Zwitt&#8208;COF solid electrolyte displays stable Li plating/stripping behavior via effective inhibition of the formation of Li dendrites and dead Li, leading to superior long&#8208;term cycle performance with retention of 99% discharge capacity and 98% Coulombic efficiency in an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal battery. Theoretical simulations reveal that the incorporation of zwitterionic groups into COF can facilitate the dissociation of strong ion pairs and reconstruct the AA&#8208;stacking configuration by dissociative adsorption of Li+ ions on Zwitt&#8208;COF producing linear hexagonal ion channels in the Zwitt&#8208;COF solid electrolyte. This strategy based on Zwitt&#8208;COF can provide an alternative way to construct various solid&#8208;state Li batteries.

Abstract
Bacterial infection is one of the greatest challenges to public health, requiring new therapeutic methods. Herein, an innovative nanozyme&#8208;armed phage (phage@palladium (Pd)) system is fabricated for combating bacterial infection. The proposed phage@Pd preserves the function of the phages to achieve precise recognition and adhesion to the host Escherichia coli. In aid of the phages, the ultrasmall Pd nanozymes equipped with conspicuous pH&#8208;dependent peroxidase&#8208;like activity can generate toxic hydroxyl radical around the bacteria in acidic and hydrogen&#8208;peroxide&#8208;overexpressed infection microenvironment while remaining inert in physiological conditions, thus realizing the noteworthy elimination of bacteria at infected sites, and in the meantime ensuring the biological safety of phage@Pd in healthy tissues. In addition, the filamentous structure of phage@Pd can also enhance its bactericidal efficiency toward nonhost bacteria by randomly entangling on them, indicating possible broad&#8208;spectrum germicidal efficacy. Notably, phage@Pd can not only eradicate planktonic bacteria, but also kill the bacteria inside the biofilm in vitro. For both in vivo models of acute bacterial pneumonia or subcutaneous abscess, phage@Pd shows significant activity in eliminating infection and promoting tissue recovery. These results demonstrate that the phage@Pd nanohybrid is a safe and effective antimicrobial agent, providing a new insight into development of advanced antibacterial materials.

         <title>Long&#8208;Cycle&#8208;Life Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery Fabrication via a Unique Chemical Bonding Interface Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na2Ti3O7 microspheres with unique chemically bonded interfaces that demonstrate unparalleled cycling stability over the entire temperature range are fabricated as anode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), highlighting the critical importance of manipulating the interfacial chemistry in SIBs, including the material and electrode/electrolyte interfaces.








Abstract
Titanates have been widely reported as anode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, their wide temperature suitability and cycle life remain fundamental issues that hinder their practical application. Herein, a novel hollow Na2Ti3O7 microsphere (H&#8208;NTO) with a unique chemically bonded NTO/C(N) interface is reported. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that the NTO/C(N) interface stabilizes the crystal structure, and the optimized interface enables the H&#8208;NTO anode to stably operate for 80&#160;000 cycles in a conventional ester electrolyte with negligible capacity loss. Optimizing the electrolyte allows the H&#8208;NTO electrode to cycle stably for 200 calendar days without capacity degradation at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. The excellent cycling stability is attributed to the NTO/C(N) interface and the stable solid electrolyte interphase formed by the highly adaptable electrolyte/electrode interface. Titanate exhibits solvent co&#8208;intercalation behavior in ether&#8208;based electrolytes, and its robust structure ensures that it can adapt to large volume changes at low temperatures.

&lt;p&gt;Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; microspheres with unique chemically bonded interfaces that demonstrate unparalleled cycling stability over the entire temperature range are fabricated as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), highlighting the critical importance of manipulating the interfacial chemistry in SIBs, including the material and electrode/electrolyte interfaces.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Titanates have been widely reported as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, their wide temperature suitability and cycle life remain fundamental issues that hinder their practical application. Herein, a novel hollow Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; microsphere (H-NTO) with a unique chemically bonded NTO/C(N) interface is reported. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that the NTO/C(N) interface stabilizes the crystal structure, and the optimized interface enables the H-NTO anode to stably operate for 80&#160;000 cycles in a conventional ester electrolyte with negligible capacity loss. Optimizing the electrolyte allows the H-NTO electrode to cycle stably for 200 calendar days without capacity degradation at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. The excellent cycling stability is attributed to the NTO/C(N) interface and the stable solid electrolyte interphase formed by the highly adaptable electrolyte/electrode interface. Titanate exhibits solvent co-intercalation behavior in ether-based electrolytes, and its robust structure ensures that it can adapt to large volume changes at low temperatures. This study provides a unique perspective on the long-cycle mechanism of titanate anodes and highlights the critical importance of manipulating the interfacial chemistry in SIBs, including the material and electrode/electrolyte interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Ionogels Tougher than Metals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrastrong and superstretchable ionogels tougher than that of metals are produced through the synergy of force&#8208;induced crystallization and halometallate ionic liquid created supramolecular ionic networks. The prepared ionogels with environmental applicability and sustainability are expected to replace lightweight high&#8208;strength materials, such as plastics and rubbers in the applications of aerospace, robotics, and other fields.








Abstract
Common natural and synthetic high&#8208;strength materials (such as rubber, plastics, ceramics, and metals) undergo the occurrence of poor deformability. Achieving high strength and large deformation simultaneously is a huge challenge. Herein, high&#8208;strength ionogels are developed through the synergy of force&#8208;induced crystallization and halometallate ionic liquid created supramolecular ionic networks. The prepared poly(vinyl alcohol)/halometallate ionic liquid ionogels show excellent mechanical properties, including ultimate fracture stress (63.1&#160;&#177;&#160;2.1&#160;MPa), strain (5248&#160;&#177;&#160;113%), and unprecedented toughness (1947&#160;&#177;&#160;52&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3), which is much higher than that of most metals and alloys. Furthermore, the ionogels can achieve reversibility by water to realize green recovery and restoration of damaged mechanical properties.

         <title>Electrostatic Attractive Self&#8208;Delivery of siRNA and Light&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Escape for Synergistic Gene Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrostatic&#8208;attraction&#8208;driven&#160;carrier&#8208;free siRNA delivery nanoparticle (siPLK1&#8208;NB NPs) is designed by grafting cationic sulfur&#8208;substituted Nile Blue photosensitizer onto deblock PLK1 siRNA strands. The siPLK1&#8208;NB NPs exhibit rapid cellular uptake, efficient lysosome escape, and outstanding tumor&#8208;targeting ability. Moreover, the siPLK1&#8208;NB NPs can effectively suppress the target PLK1 gene, achieving RNAi and PDT synergistic cancer treatment.








Abstract
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) holds immense promise for suppressing gene expression and treating various life&#8208;threatening diseases, including cancer. However, efficient delivery and lysosomal escape remain critical challenges that hinder the therapeutic effectiveness of siRNA. Herein, cationic photosensitizer (NB&#8208;Br) is grafted onto polo&#8208;like kinase 1 (PLK1) siRNA to form an amphiphilic siRNA&#8208;photosensitizer conjugate (siPLK1&#8208;NB), which can self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles (siPLK1&#8208;NB NPs) via electrostatic attraction. Notably, siPLK1&#8208;NB NPs exhibit rapid and efficient cell endocytosis, as well as outstanding tumor&#8208;targeting property in multiple tumor&#8208;bearing mice models. When siPLK1&#8208;NB NPs are located inside tumor cell lysosomes, the generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) after photoactivation can disrupt the lysosome membrane structure and facilitate siRNA escape from lysosomes. Under light irradiation, siPLK1&#8208;NB NPs can downregulate PLK1 expression and induce photodynamic killing, effectively inhibiting tumor cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. Consequently, this study provides a novel design strategy for carrier&#8208;free siRNA delivery systems. As far as it is known, this is the first report of a carrier&#8208;free siRNA delivery system based on electrostatic attraction.

         <title>Weaving Aerogels into 3D Ordered Hyperelastic Hybrid Carbon Assemblies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultralight and hyperelastic nanofiber&#8208;woven hybrid carbon assembly (NWHCA) is fabricated by nanofiber weaving of isotropic porous and mechanical brittle quasi&#8208;aerogels. The 3D&#8208;ordered lamella&#8211;bridge&#8208;structured NWHCA exhibits outstanding electrochemical activity and mechanical elasticity ascribing to the combination of metallogel&#8208;derived quasi&#8208;aerogel hybridization and nitrogen/phosphorus co&#8208;doping. Integrated wearable sensing devices based on NWHCA are demonstrated for detecting sophisticated human motions.








Abstract
The development of a 3D carbon assembly with a combination of extraordinary electrochemical and mechanical properties is desirable yet challenging. Herein, an ultralight and hyperelastic nanofiber&#8208;woven hybrid carbon assembly (NWHCA) is fabricated by nanofiber weaving of isotropic porous and mechanical brittle quasi&#8208;aerogels. Upon subsequent pyrolysis, metallogel&#8208;derived quasi&#8208;aerogel hybridization and nitrogen/phosphorus co&#8208;doping are integrated into the NWHCA. Finite element simulation indicates that the 3D lamella&#8211;bridge architecture of NWHCA with the quasi&#8208;aerogel hybridization contributes to resisting plastic deformation and structural damage under high compression, experimentally demonstrated by complete deformation recovery at 80% compression and unprecedented fatigue resistance (&gt;94% retention after 5000&#160;cycles). Due to the superelasticity and quasi&#8208;aerogel integration, the zinc&#8211;air battery assembled based on NWHCA shows excellent electrochemical performance and flexibility. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept integrated device is presented, in which the flexible battery powers a piezoresistive sensor, using the NWHCA as the air cathode and the elastic conductor respectively, which can detect full&#8208;range and sophisticated motions while attached to human skin. The nanofiber weaving strategy allows the construction of lightweight, superelastic, and multifunctional hybrid carbon assemblies with great potential in wearable and integrated electronics.

         <title>Coexistence of Both Localized Electronic States and Electron Gas at Rutile TiO2 Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;mobility electrons and localized electronic states can coexist at rutile TiO2 surfaces as induced through argon&#8208;ion irradiation. Specifically, the localized states form robust shallow in&#8208;gap states, leading to an exotic metal&#8208;to&#8208;insulator transition when cooling below a critical temperature. Furthermore, the localized states can be reactivated into free electrons through thermal heating or with external electric fields.








Abstract
Localized electron polarons formed through the coupling of excess electrons and ionic vibrations play a key role in the functionalities of materials. However, the mechanism of the coexistence of delocalized electrons and localized polarons remains underexplored. Here, the discovery of high&#8208;mobility 2D electron gas at the rutile TiO2 surfaces through argon ion irradiation induced oxygen vacancies is reported. Strikingly, the electron gas forms localized electronic states at lower temperatures, resulting in an abrupt metal&#8211;insulator transition. Moreover, it is found that the low&#8208;temperature conductivity in the insulating state is dominated by excess free electrons with a high mobility of &#8776;103 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, whereas the carrier density is dramatically suppressed with decreasing temperature. Remarkably, it reveals that the application of an electric field can lead to a collapse of the localized states, resulting in a metallic state. These results reveal the strongly correlated/coupled nature between the localized electrons and high&#8208;mobility electrons and offer a new pathway to probe and harvest the exotic electron states at the complex oxide surfaces.

         <title>Angstrom&#8208;Confined Electrochemical Synthesis of Sub&#8208;Unit&#8208;Cell Non&#8208;Van Der Waals 2D Metal Oxides</title>

How thin can non&#8208;vanderWaals (non&#8211;vdW) materials be electrochemically synthesized? In this work, a bottom&#8208;up electrochemical synthesis of a (sub&#8208;)unit&#8208;cell&#8208;thick non&#8208;vdW material is presented. By utilizing the angstrom confinement within reduced graphene oxide stacks, 2D &#945;&#8208;Cr2O3 and 2D &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 are grown with a straightforward electrochemical method obtaining a polycrystalline network of atomically thin 2Dtransition&#8211;metal oxides.








Abstract
Bottom&#8208;up electrochemical synthesis of atomically thin materials is desirable yet challenging, especially for non&#8208;van der Waals (non&#8208;vdW) materials. Thicknesses below a few nanometers have not been reported yet, posing the question&#160;how thin can non&#8208;vdW materials be electrochemically synthesized. This is important as materials with (sub&#8208;)unit&#8208;cell thickness often show remarkably different properties compared to their bulk form or thin films of several nanometers thickness. Here, a straightforward electrochemical method utilizing the angstrom&#8208;confinement of laminar reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanochannels is introduced to obtain a centimeter&#8208;scale network of atomically thin (&lt;4.3&#160;&#197;) 2D&#8208;transition metal oxides (2D&#8208;TMO). The angstrom&#8208;confinement provides a thickness limitation, forcing sub&#8208;unit&#8208;cell growth of 2D&#8208;TMO with oxygen and metal vacancies. It is showcased that Cr2O3, a material without significant catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in bulk form, can be activated as a high&#8208;performing catalyst if synthesized in the 2D sub&#8208;unit&#8208;cell form. This method displays the high activity of sub&#8208;unit&#8208;cell form while retaining the stability of bulk form, promising to yield unexplored fundamental science and applications. It is shown that while retaining the advantages of bottom&#8208;up electrochemical synthesis, like simplicity, high yield, and mild conditions, the thickness of TMO can be limited to sub&#8208;unit&#8208;cell dimensions.

         <title>Solar Biomass Reforming and Hydrogen Production with Earth&#8208;Abundant Si&#8208;Based Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient, stable, and non&#8208;toxic photocatalysts for biomass photo&#8208;reforming, which can simultaneously produce hydrogen and valuable chemicals under mild conditions, have garnered great attention. In this study, a Si&#8208;based hybrid photocatalyst enables record&#8208;high hydrogen productivity and concurrent selective production of value&#8208;added chemicals from biomass under simulated sunlight, without any buffering agent or sacrificial electron donors.








Abstract
Efficient electrochemical hydrogen production and biomass refinery are crucial for the decarbonization of various sectors. However, their energy&#8208;intensive nature and low efficiency have hindered their practical application. In this study, earth&#8208;abundant and non&#8208;toxic photocatalysts that can produce hydrogen and reform biomass efficiently, utilizing unlimited solar energy, are presented. The approach involves using low&#8208;bandgap Si flakes (SiF) for efficient light&#8208;harvesting, followed by modification with Ni&#8208;coordinated N&#8208;doped graphene quantum dots (Ni&#8208;NGQDs) to enable efficient and stable light&#8208;driven biomass reforming and hydrogen production. When using kraft lignin as a model biomass, SiF/Ni&#8208;NQGDs facilitate record&#8208;high hydrogen productivity at 14.2&#160;mmol&#160;gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and vanillin yield of 147.1&#160;mg&#160;glignin&#8722;1 under simulated sunlight without any buffering agent and sacrificial electron donors. SiF/Ni&#8208;NQGDs can be readily recycled without any noticeable performance degradation owing to the prevention of deactivation of Si via oxidation. This strategy provides valuable insights into the efficient utilization of solar energy and practical applications of electro&#8208;synthesis and biomass refinement.

         <title>Engineering Amorphous&#8211;Crystallized Interface of ZrNx Barriers for Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of the amorphous&#8211;crystalline (a&#8211;c) interface on the blocking performance of ZrNx barrier films is investigated and the interface density is quantified for proving the interdiffusion channels by pattern recognition technology. The underlying mechanisms of a&#8211;c interfaces for blocking effects are further revealed&#160;in thermodynamic and kinetics properties, constructing stable inverted perovskite solar cells with amorphous ZrNx barriers.








Abstract
It is challenging to achieve long&#8208;term stability of perovskite solar cells due to the corrosion and diffusion of metal electrodes. Integration of compact barriers into devices has been recognized as an effective strategy to protect the perovskite absorber and electrode. However, the difficulty is to construct a thin layer of a few nanometers that can delay ion migration and impede chemical reactions simultaneously, in which the delicate microstructure design of a stable material plays an important role. Herein, ZrNx barrier films with high amorphization are introduced in p&#8211;i&#8211;n perovskite solar cells. To quantify the amorphous&#8211;crystalline (a&#8211;c) density, pattern recognition techniques are employed. It is found the decreasing a&#8211;c interface in an amorphous film leads to dense atom arrangement and uniform distribution of chemical potential, which retards the interdiffusion at the interface between ions and metal atoms and protect the electrodes from corrosion. The resultant solar cells exhibit improved operational stability, which retains 88% of initial efficiency after continuous maximum power point tracking under 1&#8208;Sun illumination at room temperature (25 &#176;C) for 1500 h.

         <title>Excimer&#8208;Mediated Ultrafast Intermolecular Nonradiative Decay Enables Giant Photothermal Performance for Optimized Phototheranostic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the competitive superiority of intermolecular nonradiative decay over the conventional intramolecular nonradiative decay in developing high&#8208;performance organic photothermal materials. Rational manipulation of intermolecular nonradiative decay through simple aggregation control enables an ultrahigh photothermal conversion efficiency of 81% to realize highly efficient photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy in vivo.








Abstract
Developing organic photothermal materials (OPMs) with high photothermal performance for phototheranostic mainly focus on the manipulation of intramolecular nonradiative (intraNR) decay, which often requires quite complicated and time&#8208;consuming molecular engineering. In addition to intraNR decay, intermolecular nonradiative (interNR) decay is equally important and more convenient in governing photothermal performance. However, controlling interNR decay remains challenging due to the limited understanding of their origin and dynamics. Here, systemic investigation of intraNR and interNR decay directs the first demonstration of simple manipulation of interNR decay to produce a giant photothermal performance for optimized phototheranostic. Among three designed polymers with varying fluorine substitution, structure&#8211;performance studies reveal a dimer&#8208;initiated interNR decay to improve photothermal performance. Dimer is formed by intermolecular C&#63743;F&#183;&#183;&#183;H hydrogen bond. This finding inspires a simple aggregation control strategy to form excited dimer, namely, excimer. It initiates an &#8776;100&#8208;fold enhancement in interNR decay rate over conventional intraNR decay to produce ultrahigh photothermal conversion efficiency of 81% for efficient photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy in vivo. This study provides insights into interNR decay in achieving a giant photothermal effect and paves a convenient way to develop high&#8208;performance OPMs.

         <title>Hierarchically Ordered Macro&#8211;Mesoporous Electrocatalyst with Hydrophilic Surface for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt supported on carbon electrocatalyst with hollow&#8208;wall and 3D&#8208;ordered macroporous structures and hydrophilic surface is successfully prepared, showing high electrocatalytic performance in the oxygen reduction reaction.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) offer versatile templates/precursors to prepare supported metal catalysts. However, the afforded catalysts usually exhibit microporous structures and unsuitable wettability, which will restrict the accessibility of active sites in liquid&#8208;phase reactions. Herein, an etching&#8211;functionalization strategy is developed for the construction of a tannic&#8208;acid&#8208;functionalized MOF with a unique hollow&#8208;wall and 3D&#8208;ordered macroporous (H&#8208;3DOM) structure. The functional MOF can be further employed as an ideal precursor for the synthesis of cobalt supported on oxygen/nitrogen&#8208;co&#8208;doped carbon composites with H&#8208;3DOM structures, and hydrophilic surface. The H&#8208;3DOM structure can improve the external surface area to maximize the exposure of active sites. Moreover, the oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups can enhance the surface wettability to guarantee the external active sites to be more electrochemically accessible in aqueous electrolyte. Benefitting from these outstanding characteristics, H&#8208;3DOM&#8208;Co/ONC exhibits high electrocatalytic activity in the oxygen reduction reaction, superior to its counterparts without the hierarchically ordered structure and surface functionalization.

         <title>Quantum Size Effect to Induce Colossal High&#8208;Temperature Energy Storage Density and Efficiency in Polymer/Inorganic Cluster Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The quantum size effect is utilized to modulate the band structure of aluminum oxide clusters. Based on the &#8220;site isolation&#8221; strategy, a polymer/aluminum oxide cluster composite with uniform dispersion of the inorganic phase is prepared with one&#8208;pot synthesis, which exhibits a colossal storage energy density of 6.8&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and ultrahigh efficiency over 95% at 200&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics need to operate at high temperatures to meet the demand of electrostatic energy storage in modern electronic and electrical systems. The polymer nanocomposite approach, an extensively proved strategy for performance improvement, encounters a bottleneck of reduced energy density and poor discharge efficiency beyond 150&#160;&#176;C. In this work, a polymer/metal oxide cluster composite prepared based on the &#8220;site isolation&#8221; strategy is reported. Capitalizing on the quantum size effect, the bandgap and surface defect states of the ultrasmall inorganic clusters (2.2&#160;nm diameter) are modulated to markedly differ from regular&#8208;sized nanoparticles. Experimental results in conjunction with computational simulation demonstrate that the presence of ultrasmall inorganic clusters can introduce more abundant, deeper traps in the composite dielectric with respect to conventional polymer/nanoparticle blends. Unprecedented high&#8208;temperature capacitive performance, including colossal energy density (6.8&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3), ultrahigh discharge efficiency (95%) and superior stability at different electric field frequencies, are achieved in these polymer/cluster composites up to 200&#160;&#176;C. Along with the advantages in material preparation (inexpensive precursors and one&#8208;pot synthesis), such polymer/inorganic cluster composite approach is promising for high&#8208;temperature dielectric energy storage in practical power apparatus and electronic devices.

         <title>Rechargeable Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries with an Ultralarge Discharge Capacity per Cycle and an Ultralong Cycle Life</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;electrode rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (T&#8208;RZABs) have a hydrophobic discharge cathode, a hydrophilic charge cathode, and a zinc&#8208;free anode. The decoupled cathodes enable fast ORR/OER kinetics and avoid oxidization of the ORR catalyst. The zinc&#8208;free anode suppresses hydrogen evolution and prevents Zn dendrites. The T&#8208;RZABs have an energy density of 151.8 Wh kg&#8722;1 and a cost of 46.7 US dollars kWh&#8722;1.








Abstract
A conventional two&#8208;electrode rechargeable zinc&#8211;air battery (RZAB) has two major problems: 1) opposing requirements for the oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions from the catalyst at the air cathode; and 2) zinc&#8208;dendrite formation, hydrogen generation, and zinc corrosion at the zinc anode. To tackle these problems, a three&#8208;electrode RZAB (T&#8208;RZAB) including a hydrophobic discharge cathode, a hydrophilic charge cathode, and a zinc&#8208;free anode is developed. The decoupled cathodes enable fast ORR and OER kinetics, and avoid oxidization of the ORR catalyst. The zinc&#8208;free anode using tin&#8208;coated copper foam that induces the growth of (002)Zn planes, suppresses hydrogen evolution, and prevents Zn corrosion. As a result, the T&#8208;RZABs have a high discharge capacity per cycle of 800 mAh cm&#8722;2, a low voltage gap between the discharge/charge platforms of 0.66&#160;V, and an ultralong cycle life of 5220 h at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. A large T&#8208;RZAB with a discharge capacity of 10 Ah per cycle with no obvious degradation after cycling for 1000 h is developed. Finally, a T&#8208;RZAB pack that has an energy density of 151.8 Wh kg&#8722;1 and a low cost of 46.7 US dollars kWh&#8722;1&#160;is assembled.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Wave Pumped Perovskite Lasers with Device Area Below 1&#160;&#181;m2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous&#8208;wave optically pumped perovskite sub&#8208;micrometer lasers are demonstrated. Their thresholds are comparable to or even lower than those of several&#8208;micrometer&#8208;sized counterparts owing to their enhanced exciton&#8211;photon coupling strength. The potential of exciton&#8211;polaritons in laser miniaturization is unveiled experimentally and theoretically to develop low&#8208;threshold semiconductor lasers with device sizes approaching the optical diffraction limit.








Abstract
Continuous&#8208;wave (CW) pumped lasers with device areas below 1&#160;&#181;m2 constitute a key step to meeting the energy efficiency requirement for on&#8208;chip optical communications. However, a debate about whether a sub&#8208;micrometer device size and low threshold can be simultaneously satisfied has persisted owing to insurmountable radiation losses when approaching the optical diffraction limit. Herein, a record&#8208;small CW optically pumped perovskite laser with a device area of 0.65&#160;&#181;m2 is demonstrated. The thresholds of sub&#8208;micrometer lasers can be found lower than those of several&#8208;micrometer counterparts, and are ascribed to the enlarged group refractive index and modal confinement resulting from the enhanced exciton&#8211;photon coupling. Moreover, the operation temperature is elevated to 150&#160;K through the reduction in heat generation. These findings unveil the potential of exciton&#8211;polaritons in laser miniaturization, providing an alternative for developing low&#8208;threshold semiconductor lasers without artificial optical cavities, to approach the optical diffraction limit.

         <title>An Ultrastable Self&#8208;Assembled Antibacterial Nanospears Made of Protein</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent increasing reports of antibiotic resistance reveal an overwhelming threat to global public health, necessitating alternative approaches. By rational design and serendipity, a supramolecular nanostructure with a well&#8208;defined shape, geometry or architecture termed &#8220;nanospears&#8221; based on engineered proteins is spontaneously biofabricated via a bottom&#8208;up strategy with exceptional stability, broad&#8208;antibacterial activities and biocompatibility.








Abstract
Protein&#8208;based nanomaterials have broad applications in the biomedical and bionanotechnological sectors owing to their outstanding properties such as high biocompatibility and biodegradability, structural stability, sophisticated functional versatility, and being environmentally benign. They have gained considerable attention in drug delivery, cancer therapeutics, vaccines, immunotherapies, biosensing, and biocatalysis. However, so far, in the battle against the increasing reports of antibiotic resistance and emerging drug&#8208;resistant bacteria, unique nanostructures of this kind are lacking, hindering their potential next&#8208;generation antibacterial agents. Here, the discovery of a class of supramolecular nanostructures with well&#8208;defined shapes, geometries, or architectures (termed &#8220;protein nanospears&#8221;) based on engineered proteins, exhibiting exceptional broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activities, is reported. The protein nanospears are engineered via spontaneous cleavage&#8208;dependent or precisely tunable self&#8208;assembly routes using mild metal salt&#8208;ions (Mg2+, Ca2+, Na+) as a molecular trigger. The nanospears&#8217; dimensions collectively range from entire nano&#8208; to micrometer scale. The protein nanospears display exceptional thermal and chemical stability yet rapidly disassemble upon exposure to high concentrations of chaotropes (&gt;1 mm sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)). Using a combination of biological assays and electron microscopy imaging, it is revealed that the nanospears spontaneously induce rapid and irreparable damage to bacterial morphology via a unique action mechanism provided by their nanostructure and enzymatic action, a feat inaccessible to traditional antibiotics. These protein&#8208;based nanospears show promise as a potent tool to combat the growing threats of resistant bacteria, inspiring a new way to engineer other antibacterial protein nanomaterials with diverse structural and dimensional architectures and functional properties.

&lt;p&gt;The recent increasing reports of antibiotic resistance reveal an overwhelming threat to global public health, necessitating alternative approaches. By rational design and serendipity, a supramolecular nanostructure with a well-defined shape, geometry or architecture termed &#8220;nanospears&#8221; based on engineered proteins is spontaneously biofabricated via a bottom-up strategy with exceptional stability, broad-antibacterial activities and biocompatibility.

         <title>Promoting Oxygen Reduction Reaction by Inducing Out&#8208;of&#8208;Plane Polarization in a Metal Phthalocyanine Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The critical effect of out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization on O2 adsorption is demonstrated by the structurally defined Gr&#8208;MG&#8208;O&#8208;MPPc catalysts. The catalyst holding &#8208;V&#8208;O&#8208;Fe&#8208; axial coordination stands out with the highest O2 adsorption energy and delivers a remarkable ORR performance with half&#8208;wave potential of 0.925&#160;V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode) and kinetic current density of 26.7&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Metal phthalocyanine (MPc) material with a well&#8208;defined MN4 moiety offers a platform for catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), while the practical performance is often limited by the insufficient O2 adsorption due to the planar MN4 configuration. Here, a design (called Gr&#8208;MG&#8208;O&#8208;MPPc) is proposed, where the metal of MPc (MP) is axially coordinated to a single metal atom in graphene (Gr&#8208;MG) through a bridge&#8208;bonded oxygen atom (O), introducing effective out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization to promote O2 adsorption on MPc. Manipulating the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization charge by varying types of MP and MG (MP&#160;=&#160;Fe/Co/Ni, MG&#160;=&#160;Ti/V/Cr/Mn/Fe/Co/Ni) in the axial coordination zone of &#8208;MG&#8208;O&#8208;MP&#8208; are examined by density functional theory simulations. Among them, the catalyst of Gr&#8208;V&#8208;O&#8208;FePc stands out with the highest calculated O2 adsorption energy, which is synthesized successfully and verified by systemic X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy measurements. Importantly, it delivers a remarkable ORR performance with half&#8208;wave potential of 0.925&#160;V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode) and kinetic current density of 26.7&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. This thus demonstrates a new and simple way to pursue high catalytic performance by inducing out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization in catalysts.

         <title>Paper&#8208;Based Laser&#8208;Pyrolyzed Electrofluidics: An Electrochemical Platform for Capillary&#8208;Driven Diagnostic Bioassays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile electrochemical platform that integrates paper&#8208;based microfluidics and laser&#8208;pyrolyzed permeable electronics is introduced. This platform combines efficient electrochemical sensing with rapid capillary wicking, making it suitable for a wide range of capillary&#8208;driven biosensing assays. The devices are constructed using readily available digital fabrication tools, providing exceptional adaptability for widespread implementation.








Abstract
Microfluidic paper&#8208;based analytical devices (&#181;PADs) are indispensable tools for disease diagnostics. The integration of electronic components into &#181;PADs enables new device functionalities and facilitates the development of complex quantitative assays. Unfortunately, current electrode fabrication methods often hinder capillary flow, considerably restricting &#181;PAD design architectures. Here, laser&#8208;induced graphenization is presented as an approach to fabricate porous electrodes embedded into cellulose paper. The resulting electrodes not only have high conductivity and electrochemical activity, but also retain wetting properties for capillary transport. Paper&#8208;based electrofluidics, including a lateral flow device for injection analysis of alkaline phosphatase in serum and a vertical flow device for quantitative detection of HPV16 with a CRISPR&#8208;based assay are demonstrated. It is expected that this platform will streamline the development of diagnostic devices that combine the operational simplicity of colorimetric lateral flow tests with the added benefits and possibilities offered by electronic signaling.

         <title>Enhanced Free&#8208;Radical Generation on MoS2/Pt by Light and Water Vapor Co&#8208;Activation for Selective CO Detection with High Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A MoS2/Pt&#8208;based visible&#8208;light&#8208;activated carbon monoxide (CO) room&#8208;temperature sensor with significantly improved sensitivity, good selectivity, and long stability at high humidity is developed. The enhanced sensing performance of the sensor is attributed to lowering the activation energy by the MoS2/Pt surface to convert CO to CO2 via the free radicals induced by the synergy of photochemical effects and water vapor.









Abstract
Semiconductor&#8208;based gas sensors hold great promise for effective carbon monoxide (CO) detection. However, boosting sensor response and selectivity remains a key priority in moist conditions. In this study, a composite material, Pt quantum dots decorated MoS2 nanosheets (MoS2/Pt), is developed as a highly sensitive material for CO detection when facilitated with visible light. The MoS2/Pt sensor shows a significantly improved response (87.4%) with impressive response/recovery kinetics (20&#160;s/17&#160;s), long&#8208;term stability (60&#160;days), and good selectivity to CO at high humidity (&#8776;60%). It is confirmed both experimentally and theoretically that the MoS2/Pt surface lowers the activation energy to convert CO to CO2 via the free radicals induced by the synergy of photochemical effects and water vapor. As a result, the MoS2/Pt surface promotes both CO response and selectivity, providing fundamental clues to improve room&#8208;temperature semiconductor&#8208;based sensors for gas detection under extreme conditions.

         <title>Cartilage Lacuna&#8208;Inspired Microcarriers Drive Hyaline Neocartilage Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Culturing large&#8208;scale chondrocytes with native phenotypes remains a noteworthy challenge for cartilage tissue engineering. In this work, a novel method to fabricate mimicking cartilage lacunar hyaluronic acid microcarriers (LHAMCs) using N&#8208;hydroxy succinimide (NHS)/1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;(3&#8208;dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) with mechanotransductive conditions is presented. The data show the advanced capabilities of LHAMCs by presenting the uninterrupted, long&#8208;term culture of chondrocytes to generate an enlarged microtissue with robust chondrogenic capacity.








Abstract
Cartilage equivalents from hydrogels containing chondrocytes exhibit excellent potential in hyaline cartilage regeneration, yet current approaches have limited success at reconstituting the architecture to culture nondifferentiated chondrocytes in vitro. In this study, specially designed lacunar hyaluronic acid microcarriers (LHAMCs) with mechanotransductive conditions that rapidly form stable hyaluronic acid (HA) N&#8208;hydroxy succinimide ester (NHS&#8208;ester) are reported. Specifically, carboxyl&#8208;functionalized HA is linked to collagen type I via amide&#8208;crosslinking, and gas foaming produced by ammonium bicarbonate forms concave surface of the microcarriers.

&lt;p&gt;Culturing large-scale chondrocytes with native phenotypes remains a noteworthy challenge for cartilage tissue engineering. In this work, a novel method to fabricate mimicking cartilage lacunar hyaluronic acid microcarriers (LHAMCs) using &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxy succinimide (NHS)/1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) with mechanotransductive conditions is presented. The data show the advanced capabilities of LHAMCs by presenting the uninterrupted, long-term culture of chondrocytes to generate an enlarged microtissue with robust chondrogenic capacity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cartilage equivalents from hydrogels containing chondrocytes exhibit excellent potential in hyaline cartilage regeneration, yet current approaches have limited success at reconstituting the architecture to culture nondifferentiated chondrocytes in vitro. In this study, specially designed lacunar hyaluronic acid microcarriers (LHAMCs) with mechanotransductive conditions that rapidly form stable hyaluronic acid (HA) &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxy succinimide ester (NHS-ester) are reported. Specifically, carboxyl-functionalized HA is linked to collagen type I via amide-crosslinking, and gas foaming produced by ammonium bicarbonate forms concave surface of the microcarriers. The temporal 3D culture of chondrocytes on LHAMCs uniquely remodels the extracellular matrix to induce hyaline cartilaginous microtissue regeneration and prevents an anaerobic-to-aerobic metabolism transition in response to the geometric constraints. Furthermore, by inhibiting the canonical Wnt pathway, LHAMCs prevent &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-catenin translocation to the nucleus, repressing chondrocyte dedifferentiation. Additionally, the subcutaneous implantation model indicates that LHAMCs display favorable cytocompatibility and drive robust hyaline chondrocyte-derived neocartilage formation. These findings reveal a novel strategy for regulating chondrocyte dedifferentiation. The current study paves the way for a better understanding of geometrical insight clues into mechanotransduction interaction in regulating cell fate, opening new avenues for advancing tissue engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Potassium Deposition Enables Dendrite&#8208;Resistant Anodes for Ultrastable Potassium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

K@Bi80/NrGO anode is successfully designed as a dendrite&#8208;resistant anode. The K@Bi80/NrGO||K@Bi80/NrGO symmetric cell achieves an ultrastable reversible cycle up to 3000 h at a current density of 0.2 mA cm&#8211;2. The newly designed anode is expected to provide a fresh impetus to advance the development of potassium&#8208;metal anodes and beyond.








Abstract
Instability at the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) and uncontrollable growth of potassium dendrites have been pressing issues for potassium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, a self&#8208;supporting electrode composed of bismuth and nitrogen&#8208;doped reduced graphene oxide (Bi80/NrGO) is designed as an anode host for potassium&#8208;metal batteries. Following the molten potassium diffusion into Bi80/NrGO, the resulting K@Bi80/NrGO exhibits unique hollow pores that provide K+&#8208;diffusion channels and deposition space to buffer volume expansion, thus maintaining the electrode structure and SEI stability. The K@Bi80/NrGO also provides a controlled electric field that promotes uniform K+ flux, abundant potassiophilic N sites, and Bi alloying active sites, collectively enabling precise nucleation and selective deposition of potassium to achieve dendrite&#8208;resistant anodes. With the K@Bi80/NrGO&#8208;based optimized electrodes, the assembled K@Bi80/NrGO symmetrical cells can sustain stable cycling over 3000&#160;h at a current density of 0.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Full cells with a&#160;Prussian blue cathode and K@Bi80/NrGO anode exhibit high stability (with no degradation for 1960 cycles at 1000&#160;mA g&#8722;1) with 99% Coulombic efficiency. This work may lead to the design of anodes with the triple attributes of precise nucleation, smooth diffusion, and dendrite inhibition, ideal for developing stable potassium&#8208;metal anodes and beyond.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Narrowband Multi&#8208;Resonance Emitter Fusing Indolocarbazole Donors for BT. 2020 Red Electroluminescence and Ultralong Operation Lifetime</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pure&#8208;red multi&#8208;resonance emitter fused with indolocarbazole segments is developed, simultaneously redshifting and narrowing the emission color. The corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diode realizes BT.2020 red coordinates of (0.708, 0.292), also achieving an impressive maximum external quantum efficiency of 34.4% and an ultralong LT95 of over 10&#160;000&#160;h at an initial luminance of 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Polycyclic heteroaromatics with multi&#8208;resonance (MR) characteristics are attractive materials for narrowband emitters in wide&#8208;color&#8208;gamut organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. However, MR emitters with pure&#8208;red colors are still rare and usually exhibit problematic spectral broadening when redshifting emission. Here, a narrowband pure&#8208;red MR emitter is reported by fusing indolocarbazole segments into a boron/oxygen&#8208;embedded skeleton, realizing BT.2020 red electroluminescence for the first time together with a high efficiency and an ultralong lifetime. The rigid indolocarbazole segment possesses a strong electron&#8208;donating ability due to its para&#8208;positioned nitrogen&#8211;&#960;&#8211;nitrogen backbone and also enlarges the &#960;&#8208;extension of the MR skeleton to suppress structural displacement during radiation, achieving concurrently redshifted and narrowed emission spectrum. An emission maximum at 637 nm with a full width at half&#8208;maxima of merely 32&#160;nm (0.097&#160;eV) is recorded in toluene. The corresponding device simultaneously exhibits CIE coordinates of (0.708, 0.292) precisely matching the BT.2020 red point, a high external quantum efficiency of 34.4% with low roll&#8208;off and an ultralong LT95 (time to 95% of the initial luminance) of &gt;10&#160;000&#160;h at 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. These performance characteristics are superior even to those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art perovskite and quantum&#8208;dot&#8208;based devices for this specific color, paving the way toward practical applications.

         <title>Thermally Stable Red&#8208;Emitting Oxide Ceramics for Laser Lighting</title>

         <dc:description>
Eu2+&#8208;activated oxide&#8208;based bulk ceramics with red emission are reported. Cation&#8208;ordering in the double perovskites Sr3TaO5.5 and Sr3NbO5.5 contributes to the high external quantum efficiency and excellent thermal stability. It is further demonstrated that red&#8208;emitting Sr3TaO5.5:Eu2+ ceramic is a highly promising candidate for future high&#8208;power white laser lighting with a high luminous flux of 1115&#160;lm and ideal CRI (&#8776;90).








Abstract
Laser&#8208;driven phosphor&#8208;converted white light sources are highly desirable for their unprecedented energy efficiency and lighting quality. However, important challenges remain due to a lack of efficient and stable red&#8208;emitting materials. Here Eu2+&#8208;activated oxide&#8208;based double perovskites are explored as red emitters with thermally stable photoluminescence. Sr3TaO5.5:Eu2+ ceramics exhibit a red emission band peaking at 620&#160;nm upon blue laser pumping owing to the Eu2+ occupation at highly ordered substitutional lattice sites. A constructed laser&#8208;driven white light wheel under an incident power density of 19.2&#160;W&#160;mm&#8722;2 presents a record luminous flux of 1115&#160;lm with an excellent color rendering index of 90. This study invigorates the development of Eu2+&#8208;activated oxide&#8208;based ceramics with thermally stable luminescence for laser&#8208;pumped lighting and display applications.

An integrated free&#8208;standing functional carbon positive electrode (named MSCG) with a &#8220;point&#8208;line&#8208;plane&#8221; hierarchical architecture at the practical level of ultrahigh mass&#8208;loading (&gt;50 mg cm&#8211;2) is developed for dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs). The DIBs with ultrahigh&#8208;mass&#8208;loading MSCG electrodes achieves a high energy density of 379 Wh kg&#8211;1 based on the mass of electrode materials, which offers a promising strategy for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy&#8208;storage devices.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) have been attracting great attention&#160;for the storage of stationary energy due to their low cost, environmental friendliness, and high working voltage. However, most reports on DIBs involve low&#8208;mass&#8208;loading electrodes (&lt;2.5&#160;mg), while the use of high mass&#8208;loading electrodes (&gt;10&#160;mg cm&#8722;2), which are critical for practical application, is overlooked. Herein, an integrated free&#8208;standing functional carbon positive electrode (named MSCG) with a &#8220;point&#8208;line&#8208;plane&#8221; hierarchical architecture at the practical level of ultrahigh mass&#8208;loading (&gt;50&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) is developed for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density DIBs. The rationally designed microstructure and the advanced assembly method that is adopted produce a well&#8208;interconnected ion/electron transport channel in the MSCG electrode, which confers rapid ion/electron kinetic properties while maintaining good mechanical properties. Consequently, the DIBs with ultrahigh&#8208;mass&#8208;loading MSCG electrodes exhibits a high discharge capacity of 100.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 C (loading mass of 50&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) and a long&#8208;term cycling performance with a capacity retention of 87.7% at 1 C after 500 cycles (loading mass of 23&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). Moreover, the DIB with the ultrahigh&#8208;mass&#8208;loading positive electrode achieves a high energy density of 379&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 based on the mass of electrode materials, the highest value recorded to date for any DIBs.

         <title>Reinforcing Co&#63743;O Covalency via Ce(4f)&#9472;O(2p)&#9472;Co(3d) Gradient Orbital Coupling for High&#8208;Efficiency Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed Ce on CoO is prepared as a model to identify the active sites of rare&#8208;earth&#8208;based transition metal oxides toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the corresponding catalytic mechanism is elucidated. The Ce&#63743;O&#63743;Co unit site is identified as the active center. The enhanced OER performance is ascribed to reinforce Co&#63743;O covalency through Ce(4f)&#9472;O(2p)&#9472;Co(3d) gradient orbital coupling.








Abstract
Rare&#8208;earth (RE)&#8208;based transition metal oxides (TMO) are emerging as a frontier toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), yet the knowledge regarding their electrocatalytic mechanism and active sites is very limited. In this work, atomically dispersed Ce on CoO is successfully designed and synthesized by an effective plasma (P)&#8208;assisted strategy as a model (P&#8208;Ce SAs@CoO) to investigate the origin of OER performance in RE&#8211;TMO systems. The P&#8208;Ce SAs@CoO exhibits favorable performance with an overpotential of only 261&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and robust electrochemical stability, superior to individual CoO. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and in situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy reveal that the Ce&#8208;induced electron redistribution inhibits Co&#63743;O bond breakage in the Co&#63743;O&#63743;Ce unit site. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the gradient orbital coupling reinforces the Co&#63743;O covalency of the Ce(4f)&#9472;O(2p)&#9472;Co(3d) unit active site with an optimized Co&#8208;3d&#8208;eg occupancy, which can balance the adsorption strength of intermediates and in turn reach the apex of the theoretical OER maximum, in excellent agreement with experimental observations. It is believed that the establishment of this Ce&#8211;CoO model can set a basis for the mechanistic understanding and structural design of high&#8208;performance RE&#8211;TMO catalysts.

Single&#8208;Cell Analysis
Hourglass cell&#8208;suspension microdroplets fall like a dry powder. In article number 2300486, Mizuki Tenjimbayashi, Shota Yamamoto, and Koichiro Uto report that superhydrophobic&#8208;coated microdroplets, encapsulating single to several living cells, behave like a dry powder. The proposed &#8220;drycells&#8221; have high handling flexibility and act as a powerful cell&#8208;picking tool, significantly improving the accessibility and productivity of single&#8208;cell analysis.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Single-Cell Analysis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hourglass cell-suspension microdroplets fall like a dry powder. In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202300486"&gt;2300486&lt;/a&gt;, Mizuki Tenjimbayashi, Shota Yamamoto, and Koichiro Uto report that superhydrophobic-coated microdroplets, encapsulating single to several living cells, behave like a dry powder. The proposed &#8220;drycells&#8221; have high handling flexibility and act as a powerful cell-picking tool, significantly improving the accessibility and productivity of single-cell analysis.

Photocatalysts
In article number 2301576, Soojin Park, Jungki Ryu, and co&#8208;workers present earth&#8208;abundant and non&#8208;toxic photocatalysts that can produce hydrogen and reform biomass efficiently, utilizing solar energy. Si flakes modified with Ni&#8208;coordinated N&#8208;doped graphene quantum dots facilitate record&#8208;high hydrogen productivity under simulated sunlight without any buffering agent and sacrificial electron donors. The material can be readily recycled without any noticeable performance degradation owing to the prevention of deactivation of Si via oxidation.

Antibacterial Strategies
An innovative nanozyme&#8208;armed phage (phage@Pd) system is fabricated for combating bacterial infection, as reported by Zhengwei Mao and co&#8208;workers in article number 2301349. The phage@Pd preserves the function of phages to achieve precise recognition and adhesion to bacteria. The ultrasmall palladium (Pd) nanozymes equipped with conspicuous pH&#8208;dependent peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like activity can generate toxic hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) around bacteria in the infection microenvironment, thus selectively realizing elimination of bacteria.

Cartilage Tissue Engineering
In article number 2212114, Wenguo Cui, Qi Gu, Ming&#8208;Zhu Zhang, and co&#8208;workers introduce novel cartilage lacuna&#8208;inspired microcarriers with geometric constraints to repress chondrocyte dedifferentiation by inhibiting Wnt signaling. The biomimetic microcarriers display favorable cytocompatibility and drive robust hyaline chondrocyte&#8208;derived neocartilage formation. This study paves the way for deciphering the geometrical insights into the interactional mechanism of mechanotransduction in regulating cell fate.

         <title>Visualizing Catalytic Dynamics Processes via Synchrotron Radiation Multitechniques</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although synchrotron&#8208;radiation&#8208;based techniques play an important role in the study of catalysis, the methodological limitations of each technique have hindered their capability to give complete information. This review provides insights into recent process, regarding the application of synchrotron radiation multitechniques toward capturing catalytic dynamic processes, with the hope of viable contribution to the advancement of relevant catalysis.








Abstract
The importance of catalysts today as workhorses in most modern industrial fields cannot be downplayed. As a result, rational design and engineering of targeted catalysts have emerged as key objectives and are dependent on in&#8208;depth understanding of complex catalytic dynamics. Synchrotron radiation (SR) light sources with rich advanced experimental methods are being recognized as a comprehensive characterization platform, which can draw a full picture on such multiparameter&#8208;involved catalysis under actual working conditions. Herein, the recent progress of catalytic dynamics process studied by the means of various SR techniques is summarized. In particular, SR&#8208;based spectroscopic, scattering, and imaging investigations on true catalysts are first introduced with the potential of in situ and operando characterizations. Apparently, the limitations from single SR technique naturally prompt a simple combination of SR techniques to better understand the whole catalysis process. Moreover, the discrepancies among various online testing facilities and batches of samples, along with random/systematic errors introduced by traditional intermittent/asynchronous measurement make it imperative to develop more prolific systems, complementary of multiple SR techniques for deep probing of dynamic catalytic processes. It is believed that the booming new light sources can further enrich the current multiple SR techniques, and thus may realize the true visualization on future catalytic dynamic processes.

         <title>Design Strategies and Applications of Dimensional Optical Field Manipulation Based on Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview of recent advanced approaches of metasurfaces in the rapidly developing research field of optical multi&#8208;functional integration is presented based on the concept of multidimensional manipulation of optical fields. The newly developed dimensions enabling optical multi&#8208;functional integration based on metasurfaces are highlighted, and the challenges and perspectives of this rapidly growing field are discussed.








Abstract
Recent rapid progress in metasurfaces is underpinned by the physics of local and nonlocal resonances and the modes coupling among them, leading to tremendous applications such as optical switching, information transmission, and sensing. In this review paper, an overview of the recent advances in a broad range of dimensional optical field manipulation based on metasurfaces categorized into different classes based on design strategies is provided. This review starts from the near&#8208;field optical resonances of artificial nanostructures and discusses the far&#8208;field optical wave manipulation based on fundamental mechanisms such as mode generation and mode coupling. The recent advances in optical field manipulation based on metasurfaces in different optical dimensions such as phase and polarization are summarized, and newly&#8208;developed dimensions such as the orbital angular momentum and the coherence dimensions resulting from phase modulation&#160;are discussed. Then, the recent achievements of multiplexing and multifunctional metasurfaces empowered by multidimensional optical field manipulation for optical information transmission and integrated applications are reviewed. Finally, the paper concludes with a few perspectives on emerging trends, possible directions, and existing challenges in this fast&#8208;developing field.

         <title>Therapeutic DNAzymes: From Structure Design to Clinical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 30, July 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
During the tortuous development period, the research direction of therapeutic deoxyribozymes changes from verification of therapeutic ability to precise design, material construction, and collaborative application. This review summarizes the development process of therapeutic deoxyribozymes and analyzes the problems within the process and the corresponding solutions.








Abstract
Therapeutic DNAzymes have unceasingly intrigued the scientific community owing to their prosperous gene regulation capability. The efficacy of DNAzymes against many types of diseases has been extensively studied for over two decades. However, the high expectations for DNAzymes are still not translated to the clinic because of their low effectiveness in vivo. Over the last five years, several aspects have been considered to optimize DNAzyme&#8208;integrated therapeutics, including structural stability, mechanism exploration, cell internalization rate, cofactor activation, and off&#8208;target effects. Hence, this review first discusses the early monotherapy and structural design of DNAzymes. Subsequently, the latest modes of action are reviewed, followed by an elaboration on structural stabilization strategies considering the catalytic core and substrate&#8208;binding arms. DNAzyme&#8208;based synergistic therapy is then examined, highlighting responsive carrier construction, synergistic effects, the latest discovered advanced functions, and off&#8208;target concerns. Beyond this, key clinical advances in DNAzyme&#8208;based therapy are elucidated by showcasing clinical progress. Finally, future trends and development challenges for DNAzyme&#8208;powered therapeutics in the coming years are discussed in detail.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Fe Sites Regulated by Adjacent Single Co Atoms Anchored on N&#8208;P co&#8208;doped Carbon Structures for Highly Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>

Abstract
Manipulating the coordination environment and electron distribution for heterogeneous catalysts at the atomic level is an effective strategy to improve the electrocatalytic performance but remains challenging. Herein, atomically dispersed Fe and Co anchored on nitrogen, phosphorus co&#8208;doped carbon hollow nanorod structures (FeCo&#8208;NPC) are rationally designed and synthesized. The as&#8208;prepared FeCo&#8208;NPC catalyst exhibits significantly boosted electrocatalytic kinetics and greatly upshifted half&#8208;wave potential for the oxygen reduction reaction. Furthermore, when utilized as the cathode, the FeCo&#8208;NPC catalyst also displays excellent zinc&#8208;air battery performance. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the introduction of single Co atoms with Co&#8208;N/P coordination around isolated Fe atoms induces asymmetric electron distribution, resulting in the suitable adsorption/desorption ability for oxygen intermediates and the optimized reaction barrier, thereby improving the electrocatalytic activity.

         <title>Investigating The Superior Performance of Hard Carbon Anodes in Sodium&#8208;Ion Compared with lithium&#8208; and potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Emerging sodium&#8208;ion batteries (NIBs) and potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) show promise in complementing lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) technology and diversifying the battery market. Hard carbon is a potential anode candidate for LIBs, NIBs and KIBs due to its high capacity, sustainability, wide availability, and stable physicochemical properties. Herein, a series of hard carbons are synthesized by hydrothermal carbonization and subsequent pyrolysis at different temperatures to finely tune their structural properties. When tested as anodes, the hard carbons exhibit differing ion storage trends for Li, Na and K, with NIBs achieving the highest reversible capacity. Extensive materials and electrochemical characterizations are carried out to study the correlation of structural features with electrochemical performance, and to explain the specific mechanisms of alkali&#8208;ion storage in hard carbons. In addition, the best&#8208;performing hard carbon is tested against a sodium cathode Na3V2(PO4)3 in a Na&#8208;ion pouch cell, displaying a high power density of 2172&#160;W kg&#8722;1 at an energy density of 181.5&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 (based on the total weight of active materials in both anode and cathode). The Na&#8208;ion pouch cell also shows stable ultralong&#8208;term cycling (9000 hours or 5142 cycles) and demonstrates the promising potential of such materials as sustainable, scalable anodes for beyond Li&#8208;batteries.

         <title>Enhancing The Uniformity of Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors by a Single&#8208;Crystalline Layer&#8208;Controlled Active Channel</title>

Abstract
Despite that remarkable improvement on the mobility of the organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) has been achieved during the past decades, the uniformity in electrical performance remained ambiguous, impeding their implantation in organic integrated circuits. The coefficient of variance (CV) in mobility of reported OFETs were typically larger than 8%, which was not adequate for building medium&#8208;to&#8208;large scale integrated circuits. In this work, we showed that utilizing single&#8208;domain molecular monolayer crystals as the active channel can largely enhance the uniformity of OFETs. Benefiting from the sole molecular layer with long&#8208;range ordering, the OFETs exhibited uniformities in both channel transport and charge injection, thereby giving rise to a high average mobility of 11.64 cm2V&#8722;1s&#8722;1 and CV of only 2.57%. Statistical transmission length method evaluation was conducted, covering channel length from 3 to 21&#160;&#956;m, channel width from 90 to 170&#160;&#956;m, and a total OFET number of 370. The low contact resistance of 79.00 &#177; 7.00 &#937;&#183;cm and high intrinsic mobility of 12.36 &#177; 0.45 cm2V&#8722;1s&#8722;1 were acquired with very high accuracy and reliability. As such, this work provides a practical way to enhance the uniformity of OFETs by a single&#8208;crystalline layer&#8208;controlled active channel, towards their applications in integrated circuits.

         <title>Polymer Mechanochemistry in Microbubbles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polymer mechanochemistry is a promising technology to convert mechanical energy into chemical functionality by breaking covalent and supramolecular bonds site&#8208;selectively. Yet, the mechanochemical reaction rates of covalent bonds in typically used ultrasonication setups lead to reasonable conversions only after comparably long sonication times. This can be accelerated by either increasing the reactivity of the mechanoresponsive moiety or by modifying the encompassing polymer topology. Here, a microbubble system with a tailored polymer shell consisting of an N2 gas core and a mechanoresponsive disulfide&#8208;containing polymer network is presented. It is found that the mechanochemical activation of the disulfides is greatly accelerated using these microbubbles compared to commensurate solid core particles or capsules filled with liquid. Aided by computational simulations, it is found that low shell thickness, low shell stiffness and crosslink density, and a size&#8208;dependent eigenfrequency close to the used ultrasound frequency maximize the mechanochemical yield over the course of the sonication process.

         <title>Inhabiting Inactive Transition by Coupling Function of Oxygen Vacancies and Fe&#8208;C Bonds Achieving Long Cycle Life of Iron&#8208;Based Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fe&#8208;based battery&#8208;type anode materials with many faradaic reaction sites have higher capacities than carbon&#8208;based double&#8208;layer&#8208;type materials and can be used to develop aqueous supercapacitors with high energy density. However, as an insurmountable bottleneck, the severe capacity fading and poor cyclability derived from the inactive transition hinder their commercial application in asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs). Herein, driven by the &#8220;oxygen pumping&#8221; mechanism, oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich Fe@Fe3O4(v)@Fe3C@C nanoparticles are developed that consist of a unique &#8220;fruit with stone&#8221;&#8208;like structure and exhibit enhanced specific capacity and fast charge/discharge capability. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the capacity attenuation in conventional iron&#8208;based anodes is greatly alleviated in the Fe@Fe3O4(v)@Fe3C@C anode because the irreversible phase transition to the inactive &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 phase could be inhibited by a robust barrier formed by the coupling of oxygen vacancies and Fe&#8208;C bonds, which promotes cycle stability (93.5% capacity retention after 24,000 cycles). ASC fabricated using this Fe&#8208;based anode is also observed to have extraordinary durability, achieving capacity retention of 96.4% after 38,000 cycles, and a high energy density of 127.6 W h kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 981 W kg&#8722;1.

         <title>Buried&#8208;Interface Engineering of Conformal 2d/3d Perovskite Heterojunction for Efficient Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells on Industrially Textured Silicon</title>

Abstract
Exploring strategies to control the crystallization and modulate interfacial properties for high&#8208;quality perovskite film on industry&#8208;relevant textured crystalline silicon solar cells is highly valued in the perovskite/silicon tandem photovoltaics community. The formation of a two&#8208;dimensional/three&#8208;dimensional (2D/3D) perovskite heterojunction has been widely employed to passivate defects and suppress ion migration in the film surface of perovskite solar cells. However, realizing solution&#8208;processed heterostructures at the buried interface face solvent incompatibilities with the challenge of underlying&#8208;layer disruption and texture incompatibilities with the challenge of uneven coverage. Here, we use a hybrid two&#8208;step deposition method to prepare robust 2D perovskites with cross&#8208;linkable ligands underneath the 3D perovskite. This structurally coherent interlayer benefits the preferred crystal growth of strain&#8208;free and uniform upper perovskite, inhibits interfacial defect&#8208;induced instability and recombination, and promotes charge&#8208;carrier extraction with ideal energy&#8208;level alignment. We demonstrate the broad applicability of the bottom&#8208;contact heterostructure for different textured substrates with conformal coverage and various precursor solutions with intact properties free of erosion. With this buried interface engineering strategy, the resulting perovskite/silicon tandem cells based on industrially textured Czochralski (CZ) silicon achieve a certified efficiency of 28.4% (1.0 cm2), while retaining 89% of the initial PCE after over 1,000&#8208;hour operation.

         <title>Spider Silk&#8208;Inspired Binder Design for Flexible Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery with High Durability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The development of flexible lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) imposes demands on energy density and high mechanical durability simultaneously. Due to the limited deformability of electrodes, as well as the flat and smooth surface of the metal current collectors, stable/durable/reliable contact between electrode materials and the current collectors remains a challenge, in particular, for electrodes with high loading mass and heavily deformed batteries. Binders play an essential role in binding particles of electrode materials and adhering them to current collectors. Herein, inspired by spider silk, a binder for flexible LIBs is developed, which equips a cross&#8208;linked supramolecular poly (urethane&#8208;urea) to the polyacrylic acid. The binder imparts super high elastic restorability originating from the meticulously engineered hydrogen&#8208;bonding segments as well as extraordinary adhesion. The developed binder provides excellent flexibility and intact electrode morphologies without disintegration even when the electrode is largely deformed, enabling a stable cycling and voltage output even the batteries are put under tough dynamic deformation tests. The flexible LIBs exhibit a high energy density of 420&#160;Wh L&#8722;1, which is remarkably higher than reported numbers. The unique binder design is greatly promising and offers a valuable material solution for LIBs with high&#8208;loading mass and flexible designs.

         <title>Hybrid Data&#8208;driven Discovery of High&#8208;performance Silver Selenide&#8208;based Thermoelectric Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Optimizing material compositions often enhances thermoelectric performances. However, the large selection of possible base elements and dopants results in a vast composition design space that is too large to systematically search using solely domain knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid data&#8208;driven strategy that integrates Bayesian Optimization (BO) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to optimize the composition of five elements (Ag, Se, S, Cu, and Te) in AgSe&#8208;based thermoelectric materials. We collect data from the literature to provide prior knowledge for the initial GPR model, which is updated by actively collected experimental data during the iteration between BO and experiments. Within seven iterations, the optimized AgSe&#8208;based materials prepared using a simple high&#8208;throughput ink mixing and blade coating method deliver a high power factor of 2100 &#956;W/mK2, which is a 75% improvement from the baseline composite (nominal composition of Ag2Se1). The success of our study provides opportunities to generalize the demonstrated active machine learning technique to accelerate the development and optimization of a wide range of material systems with reduced experimental trials.

To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid data-driven strategy that integrates Bayesian Optimization (BO) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to optimize the composition of five elements (Ag, Se, S, Cu, and Te) in AgSe-based thermoelectric materials. We collect data from the literature to provide prior knowledge for the initial GPR model, which is updated by actively collected experimental data during the iteration between BO and experiments. Within seven iterations, the optimized AgSe-based materials prepared using a simple high-throughput ink mixing and blade coating method deliver a high power factor of 2100 &#956;W/mK2, which is a 75% improvement from the baseline composite (nominal composition of Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). The success of our study provides opportunities to generalize the demonstrated active machine learning technique to accelerate the development and optimization of a wide range of material systems with reduced experimental trials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Metal Core&#8208;Shell Nanoparticle Supercrystals: from Photo&#8208;Activation of Hydrogen Evolution to Photo&#8208;Corrosion</title>

         <dc:description>
Abstract
Gas nanobubbles are directly linked to many important chemical reactions. While they can be detrimental to operational devices, they also reflect the local activity at the nanoscale. In this work, supercrystals made of highly monodisperse Ag@Pt core&#8208;shell nanoparticles were first grown onto a solid support and fully characterized by electron microscopies and X&#8208;ray scattering. Supercrystals were then used as a plasmonic photo&#8208;catalytic platform for triggering hydrogen evolution reaction. The catalytic activity is measured operando at the single supercrystal level by high resolution optical microscopy which allows to probe gas nanobubbles nucleation at the early stage with high temporal resolution and to quantify the amount of gas molecules trapped inside them. Finally, a correlative microscopy approach and high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy helped to decipher the mechanisms at the origin of the local degradation of the supercrystals during catalysis, namely nanoscale erosion and corrosion.

Abstract
Materialomics integrates experiment, theory, and computation in a high&#8208;throughput manner, and has changed the paradigm for the research and development of new functional materials. Recently, with the rapid development of high&#8208;throughput characterization and machine&#8208;learning technologies, the establishment of biomaterialomics that tackles complex physiological behaviors has become accessible. Breakthroughs in the clinical translation of nanoparticle&#8208;based therapeutics and vaccines have been observed. Herein, recent advances in biomaterials, including polymers, lipid&#8208;like materials, and peptides/proteins, discovered through high&#8208;throughput screening or machine learning&#8208;assisted methods, are summarized. The molecular design of structure&#8208;diversified libraries; high&#8208;throughput characterization, screening, and preparation; and, their applications in drug delivery and clinical translation are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the prospects and main challenges in future biomaterialomics and high&#8208;throughput screening development are highlighted.

         <title>Esterase&#8208;Labile Quaternium Lipidoid Enabling Improved mRNA&#8208;LNP Stability and Spleen&#8208;Selective mRNA Transfection</title>

Abstract
Ionizable cationic lipids are recognized as an essential component of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery but can be confounded by low lipoplex stability with mRNA during storage and in vivo delivery. Herein, the rational design and combinatorial synthesis of esterase&#8208;triggered decationizable quaternium lipid&#8208;like molecules (lipidoids) is reported to develop new LNPs with high delivery efficiency and improved storage stability. This top lipidoid carries positive charges at the physiological condition but promptly acquires negative charges in the presence of esterase, thus permitting stable mRNA encapsulation during storage and in vivo delivery while balancing efficient mRNA release in the cytosol. An optimal LNP formulation is then identified through orthogonal optimization, which enables efficacious mRNA transfection selectively in spleen following intravenous administration. LNP&#8208;mediated delivery of ovalbumin (OVA)&#8208;encoding mRNA induces efficient antigen expression in antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs) and elicits robust antigen&#8208;specific immune responses against OVA&#8208;transduced tumors. The work demonstrates potential of decationizable quaternium lipidoids for spleen&#8208;selective mRNA transfection and cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>The Role of Optical Phonon Confinement in The Infrared Dielectric Response of III&#8208;V Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polar dielectrics are key materials of interest for infrared (IR) nanophotonic applications due to their ability to host phonon&#8208;polaritons (PhPs) that allow for low&#8208;loss, subdiffractional control of light. The properties of phonon&#8208;polaritons are limited by the characteristics of optical phonons, which are nominally fixed for most &#8220;bulk&#8221; materials. Superlattices composed of alternating atomically&#8208;thin materials offer control over crystal anisotropy through changes in composition, optical phonon confinement, and the emergence of new modes. In particular, the modified optical phonons in superlattices offer the potential for so&#8208;called crystalline hybrids whose IR properties cannot be described as a simple mixture of the bulk constituents. To date, however, studies have primarily focused on identifying the presence of new or modified optical phonon modes rather than assessing their impact on the IR response. This study focuses on assessing the impact of confined optical phonon modes on the hybrid IR dielectric function in superlattices of GaSb and AlSb. Using a combination of first principles theory, Raman, FTIR, and spectroscopic ellipsometry, the hybrid dielectric function is found to track with the confinement of optical phonons, leading to optical phonon spectral shifts of up to 20 cm&#8722;1. These results provide an alternative pathway towards designer IR optical materials.

         <title>Tunable Chiral Plasmonic Activities Enabled via Stimuli Responsive Micro&#8208;Origami</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Chiral plasmonic nanomaterials with distinctive circularly polarized light&#8208;dependent optical response over broad range of frequency have great potential for photonic and biomedical applications. However, it still remains challenging to fabricate 3D plasmonic chiral micro&#8208;constructs with readily modulated chiroptical properties over the magnitude of ellipticity, mode frequency and switchable handedness, especially in the visible to near&#8208;infrared range. In this study, polymeric micro&#8208;origami based 3D plasmonic chiral structures are constructed through self&#8208;rolling of gold nanoparticles (AuNS)&#8208;decorated polymeric micro&#8208;sheets. Spherical AuNSs are assembled as highly ordered linear chains on 2D rectangular micro&#8208;sheets by polydimethylsiloxane&#8208;wrinkle assisted assembly. Upon rolling the micro&#8208;sheets to micro&#8208;tubules, the AuNS chains transform into 3D helices. The AuNS assembled helices induce collective plasmonic modes propagating in a helical manner, leading to strong chiral response over Vis&#8208;NIR range. The circular dichroism (CD) is measured to be as high as hundreds millidegree, and the position and sign of CD peaks are actively modulated by controlling the orientated angle of AuNS chains, enabled by tuning the collective plasmonic modes. This micro&#8208;origami based strategy incorporated the incompatible 2D assembly technique with 3D chiral structures, opening up an intriguing way towards constructing chiral plasmonic structures and modulating of chiroptical effects based on responsive polymeric materials.

&lt;p&gt;Chiral plasmonic nanomaterials with distinctive circularly polarized light-dependent optical response over broad range of frequency have great potential for photonic and biomedical applications. However, it still remains challenging to fabricate 3D plasmonic chiral micro-constructs with readily modulated chiroptical properties over the magnitude of ellipticity, mode frequency and switchable handedness, especially in the visible to near-infrared range. In this study, polymeric micro-origami based 3D plasmonic chiral structures are constructed through self-rolling of gold nanoparticles (AuNS)-decorated polymeric micro-sheets. Spherical AuNSs are assembled as highly ordered linear chains on 2D rectangular micro-sheets by polydimethylsiloxane-wrinkle assisted assembly. Upon rolling the micro-sheets to micro-tubules, the AuNS chains transform into 3D helices. The AuNS assembled helices induce collective plasmonic modes propagating in a helical manner, leading to strong chiral response over Vis-NIR range.

         <title>A New Strategy to Elevate Absorptivity of AIEgens for Intensified Nir&#8208;Ii Emission And Synergized Multimodality Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High&#8208;efficiency absorptivity is crucial for the construction of high&#8208;performance luminescent materials, especially the long&#8208;wavelength near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) materials, thus seeking an efficient and universal strategy to elevate the absorptivity is extremely important but is still an intractable challenge. In this work, we discovered a simple but efficient design strategy involving the introduction of gold(I) unit that could effectively elevate the absorptivity of aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens). As a result of the efficient elevation of absorptivity, the representative AIE&#8208;active TBTP&#8208;Au showed more superior NIR&#8208;II (1220&#160;nm) luminescence, much higher photothermal conversion efficiency, and unique intracellular reactive oxygen species generating ability compared with that of the TBTP ligand. Take advantage of these improvements, the fabricated tumor&#8208;targeting TBTP&#8208;Au&#8208;cRGD nanoparticles achieved specific NIR&#8208;II tumorous imaging in vivo and exerted high&#8208;efficiency cancer therapy via the synergistic chemotherapy and photothermal therapy. Thus, this work provides a new and efficient strategy to construct high&#8208;absorption luminescent materials and demonstrates the great potential of gold(I)&#8208;based AIEgens as multifunctional theranostic agents.

Take advantage of these improvements, the fabricated tumor-targeting TBTP-Au-cRGD nanoparticles achieved specific NIR-II tumorous imaging in vivo and exerted high-efficiency cancer therapy via the synergistic chemotherapy and photothermal therapy. Thus, this work provides a new and efficient strategy to construct high-absorption luminescent materials and demonstrates the great potential of gold(I)-based AIEgens as multifunctional theranostic agents.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Curb Exosome Communications via Introducing Artificial Membrane Receptors for Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tumor&#8208;derived exosomes (TDEs) carry various biomolecular cargos and play crucial roles in metastasis. TDEs migrate to distal organs for intercellular communication and induce the formation of pre&#8208;metastatic niches (PMNs) to support tumor implantation and proliferation. Precise interference in the bioprocess of TDEs is expected to be efficacious for suppressing tumor metastasis. However, targeting both TDEs and the primary tumor is challenging. Here, based on metabolic glycoengineering and bio&#8208;orthogonal click chemistry, a two&#8208;step delivery strategy is designed to overcome this. During the first step, the tetraacetylated&#160;N&#8208;azidoacetyl&#8208;d&#8208;mannosamine&#8208;loaded nanoparticle responds to the metabolic activity of tumor cells in the primary tumor, tagging both tumor cells and TDEs with azide groups; dibenzyl cyclootyne&#8208;modified nanoparticles then can, as the second step, specifically react with tumor cells and TDEs through a bio&#8208;orthogonal click reaction. Our strategy not only inhibits tumor growth in pancreatic cancer models but also curbs the communicative role of TDEs in inducing liver PMNs and metastasis by tracking and downregulating the exosomal macrophage migration inhibitory factor.

         <title>Modulating the Active Hydrogen Adsorption on Fe&#8208;N Interface for Boosted Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction with Ultra&#8208;long Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The electrocatalytic reduction of nitrates to nitrogen is an environmentally friendly approach for efficient N&#8208;cycle management (towards a nitrogen&#8208;neutral cycle). However, poor catalyst durability and the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction significantly impede its practical application. Interface&#8208;chemistry engineering, utilizing the close relationship between the catalyst surface/interface microenvironment and electron/proton transfer process, has facilitated the development of catalysts with high intrinsic activity and physicochemical durability. This study reports the synthesis of a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;coated rice&#8208;like iron nitride (RL&#8208;Fe2N@NC) electrocatalyst with excellent electrocatalytic nitrate&#8208;reduction reaction (NO3RR) activity (high N2 selectivity (&#8764;96%) and NO3&#8722; conversion (&#8764;86%)). According to detailed mechanistic investigations by in&#8208;situ tests and theoretical calculations, the strong hydrogenation ability of iron nitride and enhanced nitrate enrichment of the system synergistically contributed to the rapid hydrogenation of nitrogen&#8208;containing species, increasing the intrinsic activity of the catalyst and reducing the occurrence of the competing hydrogen&#8208;evolution side reaction. Moreover, RL&#8208;Fe2N@NC showed excellent stability, retaining good NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;N2 electrocatalysis activity for more than 40 cycles (one cycle per day). This paper could guide the interfacial design of Fe&#8208;based composite nanostructures for electrocatalytic nitrate reduction, facilitating a shift towards nitrogen neutrality.

         <title>Co&#8208;Delivery of Metabolic Modulators Leads to Simultaneous Lactate Metabolism Inhibition And Intracellular Acidification for Synergistic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Simultaneous lactate metabolism inhibition and intracellular acidification (LIIA) is a promising approach for inducing tumor regression by depleting ATP. However, given the limited efficacy of individual metabolic modulators, a combination of various modulators is required for highly efficient LIIA. Herein, a co&#8208;delivery system that combines lactate transporter inhibitor, glucose oxidase, and O2&#8208;evolving nanoparticles is proposed. As a vehicle, a facile room&#8208;temperature synthetic method for large&#8208;pore mesoporous silica nanoparticles (L&#8208;MSNs) is developed. O2&#8208;evolving nanoparticles are then conjugated onto L&#8208;MSNs, followed by immobilizing the lactate transporter inhibitor and glucose oxidase inside the pores of L&#8208;MSNs. To load the lactate transporter inhibitor, which is too small to be directly loaded into the large pores, it is encapsulated in albumin by controlling the albumin conformation before being loaded into L&#8208;MSNs. Notably, inhibiting lactate efflux shifts the glucose consumption mechanism from lactate metabolism to glucose oxidase reaction, which eliminates glucose and produces acid. This leads to synergistic LIIA and subsequent ATP depletion in cancer cells. Consequently, L&#8208;MSN&#8208;based co&#8208;delivery of modulators for LIIA shows high anticancer efficacy in several mouse tumor models without toxicity in normal tissues. This study provides new insights into co&#8208;delivery of small&#8208;molecule drugs, proteins, and nanoparticles for synergistic metabolic modulation in tumors.

         <title>Intrinsic Ferromagnetic Semiconductors with High Saturation Magnetization from Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ferromagnetic semiconductors (FMS) enable simultaneous control of both charge and spin transport of charge carriers, which have emerged as a class of highly desirable but rare material for applications in spin field&#8208;effect transistors and quantum computing. Organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite with high compositional adjustability and structural versatility can offer unique benefits in the design of FMS but has not been fully explored. Here we demonstrate a series of molecular FMSs based on two&#8208;dimensional organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite structure, namely (2ampy)CuCl4, (3ampy)CuCl4 and (4ampy)CuCl4, which exhibits high saturation magnetization, dramatic temperature&#8208;dependent conductivity change and tunable ferromagnetic resonance. Magnetic measurements revealed high saturation magnetization up to 18.56 emu/g for (4ampy)CuCl4, which is one of the highest value among reported hybrid FMSs to date. Conductivity studies of the three FMSs demonstrate that the smaller adjacent octahedron distance in the two&#8208;dimensional layer results in higher conductivity. Systematic ferromagnetic resonance investigation shows that the gyromagnetic ratio and Landau factor values are strongly dependent on the types of organic cations used. This work demonstrates that two&#8208;dimensional hybrid perovskite materials can simultaneously possess both tunable long&#8208;range ferromagnetic ordering and semiconductivity, providing a straightforward strategy for designing and synthesizing high&#8208;performance intrinsic FMSs.

         <title>Solution Processed Semi&#8208;transparent Organic Solar Cells Over 50% Visible Transmittance Enabled by Silver Nanowire Electrode with Sandwich Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Photovoltaic windows with easy installation for the power supply of household appliances have long been a desire of energy researchers. However, due to the lack of top electrodes that offer both high transparency and low sheet resistance, the development of high transparency photovoltaic windows for indoor lighting scenarios has lagged significantly behind photovoltaic windows where privacy issues are involved. Addressing this issue, in this work we develop a solution processable transparent top electrode using sandwich structure silver nanowires, realizing high transparency in semi&#8208;transparent organic solar cells. The wettability and conducting properties of the electrode are improved by a modified hole&#8208;transport layer named HP. The semi&#8208;transparent solar cell exhibits good see&#8208;through properties at a high average visible transmittance of 50.8%, with power conversion efficiency of 7.34%, and light utilization efficiency of 3.73%, which is the highest without optical modulations. Moreover, flexible devices based on the above&#8208;mentioned architecture also show excellent mechanical tolerance compared with Ag electrode counterparts, which retains 94.5% of their original efficiency after 1500 bending cycles. This work provides a valuable approach for fabricating solution processed high transparency organic solar cells, which is essential in future applications in building integrated photovoltaics.

The semi-transparent solar cell exhibits good see-through properties at a high average visible transmittance of 50.8%, with power conversion efficiency of 7.34%, and light utilization efficiency of 3.73%, which is the highest without optical modulations. Moreover, flexible devices based on the above-mentioned architecture also show excellent mechanical tolerance compared with Ag electrode counterparts, which retains 94.5% of their original efficiency after 1500 bending cycles. This work provides a valuable approach for fabricating solution processed high transparency organic solar cells, which is essential in future applications in building integrated photovoltaics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synchronous diagnosis of respiratory viruses variants via receptonics based on modeling receptor&#8210;ligand dynamics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The transmission and pathogenesis of highly contagious fatal respiratory viruses are increasing, and the need for an on&#8208;site diagnostic platform has arisen as an issue worldwide. Furthermore, as the spread of respiratory virus continues, different variants have become the dominant circulating strains. To prevent virus transmission, the development of highly sensitive and accurate on&#8208;site diagnostic assays is urgently needed. Herein, we present a facile diagnostic device for multi&#8208;detection based on the results of detailed receptor&#8210;ligand dynamics simulations for the screening of various viral strains. Our novel bioreceptor&#8210;treated electronics (receptonics) device consists of a multichannel graphene transistor and cell&#8208;entry receptors conjugated to N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC). We achieved ultrasensitive multi&#8208;detection performance without the need for sample pretreatment, which will enable rapid diagnosis and prevent the spread of pathogens. This platform can be applied for the diagnosis of variants of concern in clinical respiratory virus samples and primate models. Our multi&#8208;screening platform can be used to enhance surveillance and discriminate emerging virus variants before they become a severe threat to public health.

         <title>Interfacial Regulation for 3D Printing based on Slice&#8208;Based Photopolymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The significant progress in slice&#8208;based 3D printing has boomed the rapid development of advanced manufacturing fields worldwide for scientific research and commercial communities. This review discusses the scientific impetus for improving the printing process and the printing details of slice&#8208;based 3D&#8208;printing technology from the point of view of the involved interfaces and corresponding interfacial adhesions.








Abstract
3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, can turn computer&#8208;aided designs into delicate structures directly and on demand by eliminating expensive molds, dies, or lithographic masks. Among the various technical forms, light&#8208;based 3D printing mainly involved the control of polymer&#8208;based matter fabrication and realized a field of manufacturing with high tunability of printing format, speed, and precision. Emerging slice&#8208; and light&#8208;based 3D&#8208;printing methods have prosperously advanced in recent years but still present challenges to the versatility of printing continuity, printing process, and printing details control. Herein, the field of slice&#8208; and light&#8208;based 3D printing is discussed and summarized from the view of interfacial regulation strategies to improve the printing continuity, printing process control, and the character of printed results, and several potential strategies to construct complex 3D structures of distinct characteristics with extra external fields, which are favorable for the further improvement and development of 3D printing, are proposed.

         <title>Dynamical Behaviors of Oscillating Metallosurfactant Coacervate Microdroplets under Redox Stress</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic coacervation is presented from redox&#8208;active metallosurfactants as a model system to study non&#8208;equilibrium phenomena in life. The compartmentalized protocell coacervates display collective dynamics that synchronize into system oscillations, showing autonomous death/regeneration and contraction/expansion cycles sustaining both in solution and at colloidal interface, allowing for dynamic sequestration, mass transport and passing through nanosized channels.








Abstract
Living systems create complex structures and functions by mastering self&#8208;organization in a variety of equilibrium and non&#8208;equilibrium states. Mimicking the dynamical phenomena with synthetic cell&#8208;like entities (protocells) under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions offers an important step toward the representation of minimum life. Here, the cell&#8208;sized coacervate microdroplets assembled from associative metallosurfactant coacervation via liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) that exhibits non&#8208;equilibrium behaviors are reported. The compartmentalized protocell coacervates display collective dynamics that synchronize into system oscillations, showing autonomous death/regeneration and contraction/expansion cycles with external redox stress. The collective oscillation of abiotic metallosurfactant microdroplets can sustain both in solution and at the colloidal interface, allowing for dynamic sequestration, mass transport, and passing through nanosized channels, reminiscent of red blood cells&#160;that can deform and squeeze through narrow capillaries. The design of self&#8208;oscillating cell&#8208;sized constructs will shed a light on the creation of life&#8208;like soft materials with autonomous motion driven by complex chemical stimuli, which can be further used as nonbiological models for dynamic aggregates and intercellular communication.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Mediated DNA Nanotechnology in 3D: Structural Library by Templated Diffraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The founding objective of structural DNA nanoscience is demonstrated by using self&#8208;assembled DNA scaffolds for the structure determination of biomolecules by X&#8208;ray diffraction. A structural library of 32 metal&#8208;mediated DNA base pairs (mmDNA) with Ag+, Hg2+, and Au+is assembled and the fundamental design rules for an expanded mmDNA coding system further elucidated, toward the development of molecular electronics and designer nanomaterials.








Abstract
DNA double helices containing metal&#8208;mediated DNA (mmDNA) base pairs are constructed from Ag+ and Hg2+ ions between pyrimidine:pyrimidine pairs with the promise of nanoelectronics. Rational design of mmDNA nanomaterials is impractical without a complete lexical and structural description. Here, the programmability of structural DNA nanotechnology toward its founding mission of self&#8208;assembling a diffraction platform for biomolecular structure determination is explored. The tensegrity triangle is employed to build a comprehensive structural library of mmDNA pairs via X&#8208;ray diffraction and generalized design rules for mmDNA construction are elucidated. Two binding modes are uncovered: N3&#8208;dominant, centrosymmetric pairs and major groove binders driven by 5&#8208;position ring modifications. Energy gap calculations show additional levels in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of mmDNA structures, rendering them attractive molecular electronic candidates.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Resonant Mie Resonator Arrays for Broadband Light Trapping in Ultrathin c&#8208;Si Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanophotonic design strategy to realize Mie&#8208;resonator arrays that can combine antireflection and light&#8208;trapping functions in a single, thin layer is discussed. The proposed light&#8208;trapping antireflection coating is experimentally demonstrated on a 2.8&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick crystalline silicon (c&#8208;Si) solar cell, resulting in a 48% enhancement in the short&#8208;circuit current as compared to a planar cell and an absolute efficiency of 11.2%.








Abstract
Effective photon management is critical to realize high power conversion efficiencies for thin crystalline silicon (c&#8208;Si) solar cells. Standard few&#8208;100&#8208;&#181;m&#8208;thick bulk cells achieve light trapping with macroscopic surface textures covered by thin, continuous antireflection coatings. Such sizeable textures are challenging to implement on ultrathin cells. Here, it is illustrated how nanoscale Mie&#8208;resonator&#8208;arrays with a bimodal size distribution support multiple resonances that can work in concert to achieve simultaneous antireflection and light&#8208;trapping across the broad solar spectrum. The effectiveness of these light&#8208;trapping antireflection coatings is experimentally demonstrated on a 2.8&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick c&#8208;Si solar cell. The measured short&#8208;circuit current and corresponding power conversion efficiency are notably improved, achieving efficiencies as high as 11.2%. Measurements of the saturation current density on completed cells indicate that thermal oxides can effectively limit surface recombination. The presented design principles are applicable to a wide range of solar cells.

The effectiveness of these light-trapping antireflection coatings is experimentally demonstrated on a 2.8&#160;&#181;m-thick c-Si solar cell. The measured short-circuit current and corresponding power conversion efficiency are notably improved, achieving efficiencies as high as 11.2%. Measurements of the saturation current density on completed cells indicate that thermal oxides can effectively limit surface recombination. The presented design principles are applicable to a wide range of solar cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Active Thermal Metasurfaces for Remote Heating/Cooling by Mimicking Negative Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A long&#8208;focus thermal lens with equivalent negative thermal conductivity is designed and experimentally realized to achieve a remote heating/cooling effect. The thermal lens consists of active thermal metasurfaces, which are constructed by p/n&#8208;type semiconductor pairs driven by a DC power supply. The proposed method can also achieve other novel thermal effects, such as thermal superlens and thermal tunneling effects.








Abstract
Remote temperature control can be obtained by a long&#8208;focus thermal lens that can focus heat fluxes into a spot far from the back surface of the lens and create a virtual thermal source/sink in the background material, around which the temperature field distribution can be remotely controlled by varying the parameters of the thermal lens. However, because of the lack of negative thermal conductivity, existing thermal lenses have extremely short focal lengths and cannot be used to remotely control the temperature field around the virtual thermal source/sink. In this study, a general approach is proposed to equivalently realize materials with negative thermal conductivity using elaborately distributed active thermal metasurfaces (ATMSs). Subsequently, the proposed ATMS is used to implement a novel thermal lens with a long focal length designed using transformation thermodynamics, and finally realize the ATMS with realistic materials and experimentally verify the performance of the designed long&#8208;focus thermal lens (measured focal length of 19.8&#160;mm) for remote heating/cooling. The proposed method expands the scope of the thermal conductivity and provides new pathways to realize unprecedented thermal effects with effective negative thermal conductivity, such as &#8220;thermal surface plasmon polaritons,&#8221; a thermal superlens, the thermal tunneling effect, and the thermal invisible gateway.

         <title>Albumin&#8208;Hitchhiking Drug Delivery to Tumor&#8208;Draining Lymph Nodes Precisely Boosts Tumor&#8208;Specific Immunity through Autophagy Modulation of Immune Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pH&#8208;responsive &#8220;albumin&#8208;hitchhiking&#8221; micelle POR/DT is established by self&#8208;assembly of tumor&#8208;targeting oxaliplatin prodrug (POR) and lipophilized trehalose prodrug (DT). POR prodrug can cause tumor cells&#8217; immunogenic death and antigen release, while lipophilic modification enhances autophagy inducer's binding to endogenous albumin and realizes TDLN&#8208;selective reflux, where it upregulates autophagy&#8208;mediated antigen processing and presentation in DCs.








Abstract
Tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) are the first sites where tumor components reach and dendritic cells (DCs) present tumor&#8208;associated antigens to T cells. DCs rely on autophagy to process tumor antigens into epitope peptides to form epitope&#8208;MHC complexes. Selective delivery of autophagy&#8208;stimulating drugs to TDLNs may be a precise strategy to boost chemotherapy&#8208;induced antitumor immunity. Here, a multistage stimulating strategy is proposed to activate the antitumor immunity cascade by inducing immunogenic death of tumor cells and elevating antigen presentation of DCs in TDLNs. A tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;responsive &#8220;albumin&#8208;hitchhiking&#8221; micelle is established by self&#8208;assembling tumor&#8208;targeting oxaliplatin prodrug and lipophilized trehalose prodrug. This demonstrates that lipophilic modification of trehalose with a DSPE tail and the precise exposure in the tumor site enhances its binding to endogenous albumin and realizes TDLNs&#8208;selective reflux, where it upregulates antigen processing and presentation of DCs. This study introduces an approach for targeted delivery to TDLNs and provides insights into mechanisms of autophagy in tumor&#8208;specific immunity.

         <title>Optical Switching of Hole Transfer in Double&#8208;Perovskite/Graphene Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge transfer across heterostructure interfaces crucially determines device applications, including light sensing. In this work, an optical switching of the hole&#8208;transfer direction and efficiency across strongly coupled double&#8208;perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6/graphene heterostructures by tuning the excitation wavelength is reported. This provides a novel way to control the interfacial charge flow across a semiconductor/graphene heterojunction.








Abstract
Synergically combining their respective ultrahigh charge mobility and strong light absorption, graphene (Gr)/semiconductor heterostructures are promising building blocks for efficient optoelectronics, particularly photodetectors. Charge transfer (CT) across the heterostructure interface crucially determines device efficiency and functionality. Here, it is reported that hole&#8208;transfer processes dominate the ultrafast CT across strongly coupled double&#8208;perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6/graphene (DP/Gr) heterostructures following optical excitation. While holes are the primary charges flowing across interfaces, their transfer direction, as well as efficiency, show a remarkable dependence on the excitation wavelength. For excitation with photon energies below the bandgap of DPs, the photoexcited hot holes in Gr can compete with the thermalization process and inject into in&#8208;gap defect states in DPs. In contrast, above&#8208;bandgap excitation of DP reverses the hole&#8208;transfer direction, leading to hole transfer from the valence band of DPs to Gr. Experimental evidence that increasing the excitation photon energy enhances CT efficiency for both below&#8208; and above&#8208;bandgap photoexcitation regimes is further provided, unveiling the positive role of excess energy in enhancing interfacial CT. The possibility of switching the hole&#8208;transfer direction and thus the interfacial photogating field by tuning the excitation wavelength, provides a novel way to control the interfacial charge flow across a DP/Gr heterojunction.

         <title>Quantum Dots Facilitate 3D Two&#8208;Photon Laser Lithography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D two&#8208;photon laser lithography is considered a disruptive nanostructuring technology in many fields. However, enhancing the printing resolution and developing new printing materials are still in much demand. In this work, a cost&#8208;effective method to tackle this situation, by incorporating chemically modified quantum dots, is presented, showing superb performance improvement. The resolution enhancement mechanism is then further elucidated.








Abstract
In the past two decades, direct laser writing (DLW) technologies have seen tremendous growth. However, strategies that enhance the printing resolution and the development of printing material with assorted functionalities are still sparser than expected. Herein, a cost&#8208;effective method to tackle this bottleneck is presented. Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are selected to carry out this task, most importantly via surface chemistry modification to enable their copolymerization with themonomers, resulting in transparent composites. The evaluations indicate that the QDs show great colloidal stability and their photoluminescent properties are well&#8208;preserved. This allows further exploration of the printing characteristics of such composite material. It is shown that in the presence of the QDs, the material provides a much lower polymerization threshold with faster linewidth growth, indicating that the QDs form a synergetic relationship with the monomer and the photoinitiator, widening the dynamic range of the material and thus increasing the writing efficiency for broader fields of applications. Lowering the polymerization threshold reduces the minimum achievable feature size by &#8776;32%, which is well&#8208;matched with STED&#8208;based (i.e., stimulated&#8208;emission depletion microscopy) methods in writing 3D structures. The study further elucidates the mechanism of the synergetic behavior, further guiding the future development of functional materials for DLW&#8208;related printing technologies.

An LGWH&#8208;driven interfacial water evaporation system based on 3D superhydrophilic foam offers a record&#8208;high steam generation for clean water production and salt recovery from high salinity water (seawater or wastewater)








Abstract
Clean water scarcity and energy shortage have become urgent global problems due to population growth and human industrial development. Low&#8208;grade waste heat (LGWH) is a widely available and ubiquitous byproduct of human activities worldwide, which can provide effective power to address the fresh water crisis without additional energy consumption and carbon emissions. In this regard, 3D superhydrophilic polyurethane/sodium alginate (PU/SA) foam and LGWH&#8208;driven interfacial water evaporation systems are developed, which can precipitate over 80&#160;L&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 steam generation from seawater and has favorable durability for purification of high salinity wastewater. The excellent water absorption ability, unobstructed water transport, and uniform thin water layer formed on 3D skeletons of PU/SA foam ensure the strong heat exchange between LGWH and fluidic water. As a result, the heat&#8208;localized PU/SA foam enables the efficient energy utilization and ultrafast water evaporation once LGWH is introduced into PU/SA foam as heat flow. In addition, the precipitated salt on PU/SA foam can be easily removed by mechanical compression, and almost no decrease in water evaporation rate after salt precipitation and removal for many times. Meanwhile, the collected clean water has high rejection of ions of 99.6%, which meets the World Health Organization (WHO) standard of drinking water. Above all, this LGWH&#8208;driven interfacial water evaporation system presents a promising and easily accessible solution for clean water production and water&#8211;salt separation without additional energy burden for the society.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot, Three&#8208;Phase Recycling of Metals from Li&#8208;Ion Batteries in Rotating, Concentric&#8208;Liquid Reactors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal mixtures from spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries are rapidly and selectively separated one&#8208;pot in a rotating, concentric&#8208;liquid reactor. In this reactor, vigorous stirring at interfacial regions does not cause mixing of the aqueous metal&#8208;feed and acceptor layers, while the organic extractants are allowed to shuttle between these layers multiple times.








Abstract
Efficient recycling of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is essential for making their numerous applications sustainable. Hydrometallurgy&#8208;based separation methods are an indispensable part of the recycling process but remain limited by the extraction efficiency and selectivity, and typically require numerous binary liquid&#8211;liquid extraction steps in which the capacity of the extracting organic phase or partition coefficient of extracted metals become an overall bottleneck. Herein, rotating reactors are described, in which the aqueous feed, organic extractant, and aqueous acceptor phases are all present in the same rotating vessel and can be vigorously stirred and emulsified without the coalescence of aqueous layers. In this arrangement, the extractant molecules are not equilibrated with the feed and, instead, &#8220;shuttle&#8221; between the feed/extractant and the extractant/acceptor interfaces multiple times, with each such molecule ultimately transferring approximately ten metal ions. This shuttling allows for using extractant concentrations much lower than in previous designs even for extremely concentrated feeds and, simultaneously, ensures unprecedented speed and selectivity of the one&#8208;pot processes. These experimental results are accompanied by theoretical considerations of the selectivity versus speed trends as well as discussion of parameters essential for system upscaling.

         <title>Direct Probing of Lattice&#8208;Strain&#8208;Induced Oxygen Release in LiCoO2 and Li2MnO3 without Electrochemical Cycling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic&#8208;scale observation directly shows that a significant amount of oxygen loss is induced exclusively by lattice strain in pristine layered oxides without any electrochemical Li extraction under high voltage application. This work offers crucial insight toward the importance of strain relaxation to suppress oxygen loss for better cycling performance of layered oxide cathodes.








Abstract
Since the recognition of a significant oxygen&#8208;redox contribution to enhancing the capacity of Li transition&#8208;metal oxide cathodes, the oxygen release and subsequent structural variations together with capacity fading are critical issues to achieve better electrochemical performance. As most previous reports dealt with the structural degradation of cathodes after electrochemical cycling, it is fairly difficult to clarify how substantial the effect of lattice strain on the oxygen release will be while exclusively ruling out any electrochemical influences. By utilizing nanoindentation and mechanical surface polishing of single&#8208;crystal LiCoO2 and Li2MnO3, the local variations of both the atomic structure and oxygen content are scrutinized. Atomic&#8208;column&#8208;resolved imaging reveals that local Li&#63743;M (M = Co and Mn) disordering and further amorphization are induced by mechanical strain. Moreover, substantial oxygen deficiency in the regions with these structural changes is directly identified by spectroscopic analyses. Ab initio density functional theory calculations also demonstrate energetically favorable formation of oxygen vacancies under shear strain. Providing direct evidence of oxygen release as a consequence of lattice strain, the findings in this work suggest that efficient strain relaxation will be of great significance for longevity of the anion framework in layered oxide cathodes.

         <title>Interfacial&#8208;Catalysis&#8208;Enabled Layered and Inorganic&#8208;Rich SEI on Hard Carbon Anodes in Ester Electrolytes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative interface catalysis mechanism is developed to controllably design a homogenous, layered, and inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on hard carbon anodes in ester electrolytes by surface&#8208;reconstruction with abundant C&#63742;O (carbonyl) bonds, which are active centers for preferentially catalyzing salt reduction. Due to such rationally regulated SEI, sodium&#8208;storage performance regarding initial Columbic efficiency, rate capability, and cycling stability is comprehensively enhanced.








Abstract
Constructing a homogenous and inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) can efficiently improve the overall sodium&#8208;storage performance of hard carbon (HC) anodes. However, the thick and heterogenous SEI derived from conventional ester electrolytes fails to meet the above requirements. Herein, an innovative interfacial catalysis mechanism is proposed to design a favorable SEI in ester electrolytes by reconstructing the surface functionality of HC, of which abundant C&#63742;O (carbonyl) bonds are accurately and homogenously implanted. The C&#63742;O (carbonyl) bonds act as active centers that controllably catalyze the preferential reduction of salts and directionally guide SEI growth to form a homogenous, layered, and inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. Therefore, excessive solvent decomposition is suppressed, and the interfacial Na+ transfer and structural stability of SEI on HC anodes are greatly promoted, contributing to a comprehensive enhancement in sodium&#8208;storage performance. The optimal anodes exhibit an outstanding reversible capacity (379.6 mAh g&#8722;1), an ultrahigh initial Coulombic efficiency (93.2%), a largely improved rate capability, and an extremely stable cycling performance with a capacity decay rate of 0.0018% for 10&#8239;000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1. This work provides novel insights into smart regulation of interface chemistry to realize high&#8208;performance HC anodes for sodium storage.

         <title>Mobile Kink Solitons in a Van der Waals Charge&#8208;Density&#8208;Wave Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mobile solitons are discovered in a van der Waals material as kinks and antikinks along domain walls in the 2D layer with spontaneously broken symmetry. The mobility, electronic states, and topology of kink solitons are elucidated, which makes the application of solitons in van der Waals electronic materials promising.








Abstract
Kinks, point&#8208;like geometrical defects along dislocations, domain walls, and DNA, are stable and mobile, as solutions of a sine&#8208;Gordon wave equation. While they are widely investigated for crystal deformations and domain wall motions, electronic properties of individual kinks have received little attention. In this work, electronically and topologically distinct kinks are discovered along electronic domain walls in a correlated van der Waals insulator of 1T&#8208;TaS2. Mobile kinks and antikinks are identified as trapped by pinning defects and imaged in scanning tunneling microscopy. Their atomic structures and in&#8208;gap electronic states are unveiled, which are mapped approximately into Su&#8211;Schrieffer&#8211;Heeger solitons. The twelvefold degeneracy of the domain walls in the present system guarantees an extraordinarily large number of distinct kinks and antikinks to emerge. Such large degeneracy together with the robust geometrical nature may be useful for handling multilevel information in van der Waals materials&#160;architectures.

In this work, electronically and topologically distinct kinks are discovered along electronic domain walls in a correlated van der Waals insulator of 1T-TaS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Mobile kinks and antikinks are identified as trapped by pinning defects and imaged in scanning tunneling microscopy. Their atomic structures and in-gap electronic states are unveiled, which are mapped approximately into Su&#8211;Schrieffer&#8211;Heeger solitons. The twelvefold degeneracy of the domain walls in the present system guarantees an extraordinarily large number of distinct kinks and antikinks to emerge. Such large degeneracy together with the robust geometrical nature may be useful for handling multilevel information in van der Waals materials&#160;architectures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design of Fluoro&#8208;Free Surfaces Super&#8208;Repellent to Low&#8208;Surface&#8208;Tension Liquids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The widespread use of perfluoroalkyls for super&#8208;liquid&#8208;repellent surfaces is environmentally unsustainable, motivating the exploration of fluoro&#8208;free alternatives. In this work, the concept of liquid&#8208;centric design and the revised limits for using fluoro&#8208;free materials (hydrocarbons and silicones) in achieving super&#8208;liquid&#8208;repellency with low&#8208;surface&#8208;tension liquids is demonstrated. Scale bar in image: 1 mm. 








Abstract
Super&#8208;liquid&#8208;repellent surfaces feature high liquid contact angles and low sliding angles find key applications in anti&#8208;fouling and self&#8208;cleaning. While repellency for water is easily achieved with hydrocarbon functionalities, repellency for many low&#8208;surface&#8208;tension liquids (down to 30 mN&#160;m&#8722;1) still requires perfluoroalkyls (a persistent environmental pollutant and bioaccumulation hazard). Here, the scalable room&#8208;temperature synthesis of stochastic nanoparticle surfaces with fluoro&#8208;free moieties is investigated. Silicone (dimethyl and monomethyl) and hydrocarbon surface chemistries are benchmarked against perfluoroalkyls, assessed using model low&#8208;surface&#8208;tension liquids (ethanol&#8211;water mixtures). It is discovered that both hydrocarbon&#8208; and dimethyl&#8208;silicone&#8208;based functionalization can achieve super&#8208;liquid&#8208;repellency down to 40&#8211;41 mN&#160;m&#8722;1 and 32&#8211;33 mN&#160;m&#8722;1, respectively (vs&#160;27&#8211;32 mN&#160;m&#8722;1 for perfluoroalkyls). The dimethyl silicone variant demonstrates superior fluoro&#8208;free liquid repellency likely due to its denser dimethyl molecular configuration. It is shown that perfluoroalkyls are not necessary for many real&#8208;world scenarios requiring super&#8208;liquid&#8208;repellency. Effective super&#8208;repellency of different surface chemistries against different liquids can be adequately predicted using empirically verified phase diagrams. These findings encourage a liquid&#8208;centric design, i.e., tailoring surfaces for target liquid properties. Herein, key guidelines are provided for achieving functional yet sustainably designed super&#8208;liquid&#8208;repellency.

         <title>Hydroiodic&#8208;Acid&#8208;Initiated Dense yet Porous Ti3C2Tx MXene Monoliths toward Superhigh Areal Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gelation&#8211;densification approach of MXenes to produce thick and dense electrodes with superhigh areal capacitance is proposed. Hydroiodide acids can not only serve as initiators to trigger the gelation of MXenes and construct stable 3D&#160;networks, but also leave highly shrinking porous structures by application of capillary forces during their controlled removal.








Abstract
The assembly of 3D&#160;structured materials from 2D&#160;units paves a royal road for building thick and dense electrodes, which are long sought after for practical energy&#8208;storage devices. 2D transitional metal carbides (MXene) are promising for this due to their capabilities of solution&#8208;based assembly and intrinsic high density, yet face huge challenges in yielding high areal capacitance electrodes owing to the absence of porous ion&#8208;transport paths. Here, a gelation&#8211;densification process initiated by hydroiodide acids (HI) is proposed, where the protons break the electrostatic balance of MXene nanosheets to trigger gelation, while HI serves as a spacer to prevent nanosheets from restacking during capillary shrinkage. More promising, the controlled evaporation of reductive HI leaves superiorly shrinking yet porous network for ion transport, and the produced monoliths exhibit a high density of 2.74&#160;g cm&#8722;3 and an unprecedented areal capacitance of 18.6 F cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Rapid and Scalable Transfer of Large&#8208;Area Graphene Wafers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the engineering of interfacial forces during the transfer process, the crack&#8208;free and clean transfer of 4&#8208;inch&#8208;sized graphene wafers onto silicon wafers within only 15&#160;min is realized, which is compatible with batch production of graphene wafers on target substrates.








Abstract
Recently, scalable production of large&#8208;area graphene films on metal foils with promising qualities is successfully achieved by eliminating grain boundaries, wrinkles, and adlayers. The transfer of graphene from growth metal substrates onto functional substrates remains one inescapable obstacle on the road to the real commercial applications of chemical vaport deposition (CVD) graphene films. Current transfer methods still require time&#8208;consuming chemical reactions, which hinders its mass production, and produces cracks and contamination that strongly impede performance reproducibility. Therefore, graphene transfer techniques with fine intactness and cleanness of transferred graphene, and improved production efficiency would be ideal for the mass production of graphene films on destination substrates. Herein, through the engineering of interfacial forces enabled by sophisticated design of transfer medium, the crack&#8208;free and clean transfer of 4&#8208;inch&#8208;sized graphene wafers onto silicon wafers within only 15&#160;min is realized. The reported transfer method is an important leap over the long&#8208;lasting obstacle of the batch&#8208;scale graphene transfer without degrading the quality of graphene, bringing the graphene products close to the real applications.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Rich Piezoelectric BiO2&#8722;x Nanosheets for Augmented Piezocatalytic, Sonothermal, and Enzymatic Therapies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich BiO2&#8722;x nanosheet is developed by a defect engineering strategy to enhance reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by lowering the energy gap, and is applied for the synergistic piezocatalytic, enzymatic, and sonothermal therapies. Density functional theory calculations show that the oxygen vacancies are favorable for H2O2&#160;adsorption and increasing the carrier density to produce ROS.








Abstract
Piezocatalytic therapy is a new&#8208;emerging reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;enabled therapeutic strategy that relies on built&#8208;in electric field and energy&#8208;band bending of piezoelectric materials activated by ultrasound (US) irradiation. Despite becoming a hot topic, material development and mechanism exploration are still underway. Herein, as&#8208;synthesized oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich BiO2&#8722;x nanosheets (NSs) demonstrate outstanding piezoelectric properties. Under US, a piezo&#8208;potential of 0.25&#160;V for BiO2&#8722;x NSs is sufficient to tilt the conduction band to be more negative than the redox potentials of O2/&#8226;O2&#8722;, &#8226;O2&#8722;/H2O2, and H2O2/&#8226;OH, which initiates a cascade reaction for ROS generation. Moreover, the BiO2&#8722;x NSs exhibit peroxidase and oxidase&#8208;like activities to augment ROS production, especially in the H2O2&#8208;overexpressed tumor microenvironment. Density functional theory calculations show that the generated oxygen vacancies in BiO2&#8722;x NSs are favorable for H2O2&#160;adsorption and increasing the carrier density to produce ROS. Furthermore, the quick movement of electrons enables an excellent sonothermal effect, for example, rapid rise in temperature to nearly 65&#160;&#176;C upon US with low power (1.2&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2) and short time (96&#160;s). Therefore, this system realizes a multimode synergistic combination of piezocatalytic, enzymatic, and sonothermal therapies, providing a new direction for defect engineering&#8208;optimized piezoelectric materials for tumor therapy.

&lt;/i&gt; NSs exhibit peroxidase and oxidase-like activities to augment ROS production, especially in the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-overexpressed tumor microenvironment. Density functional theory calculations show that the generated oxygen vacancies in BiO&lt;sub&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;

&lt;/i&gt; NSs are favorable for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;adsorption and increasing the carrier density to produce ROS. Furthermore, the quick movement of electrons enables an excellent sonothermal effect, for example, rapid rise in temperature to nearly 65&#160;&#176;C upon US with low power (1.2&#160;W&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and short time (96&#160;s). Therefore, this system realizes a multimode synergistic combination of piezocatalytic, enzymatic, and sonothermal therapies, providing a new direction for defect engineering-optimized piezoelectric materials for tumor therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Composite of Hierarchical Porous MOFs and Halloysite Nanotubes as Single&#8208;Ion&#8208;Conducting Electrolyte Toward High&#8208;Performance Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

A novel H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8/HNT composite of hierarchical porous H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8 and hollow halloysite nanotube is employed as an electrolyte in lithium&#8208;ion conduction in solid&#8208;state batteries, presenting excellent comprehensive electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), as a promising rechargeable electrochemical energy storage material have emerged in the field of solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. However, low ionic conductivity and high interfacial impedance still severely hamper the application of MOF&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSE). In this work, a novel hierarchical porous H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8 solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) material is harvested through the in situ growth of zinc nitrate hydroxide nanosheets, expressing excellent ion conductivity of 1.04 &#215; 10&#8722;3&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 and Li+&#8208;transference number of 0.71. Moreover, the morphology and structure of H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8 is further optimized to obtain a composite H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8/HNT by decorating halloysite nanotubes (HNT). Notably, functionalized H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8/HNT as an electrolyte presents obvious enhancement on electrochemical properties: higher ionic conductivity of 7.74 &#215; 10&#8722;3&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1, better single&#8208;ion transmittability (tLi+${t}_{{\mathrm{Li}}^{+}}$ = 0.84), good interfacial compatibility as well as excellent rate performance. More importantly, the Li/LiFePO4 battery equipped with H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8/HNT SSE has efficient lithium&#8208;dendrite suppression and up to 84% capacity retention (104.16&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1) after 200 times galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles. This work enriches the solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion composite electrolyte materials, opening an entirely new way for enhancing electrochemical performance.

         <title>Nacre&#8208;Mimetic Nanocomposite Aerogels with Exceptional Mechanical Performance for Thermal Superinsulation at Extreme Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nacre&#8208;mimetic nanocomposite aerogels featuring a &#8220;porous brick and fiber&#8221; architecture are fabricated via in situ nanoscale hetero&#8208;assembly and ambient pressure drying, in which mesoporous minerals are generated in a lamellar cellulose nanofibrous network. The aerogels integrate challenging requirements of thermal superinsulation, excellent compressive stiffness, superelasticity, high bending flexibility, good impact resistance, and easy scalability for robust thermal management under extreme conditions.








Abstract
Thermal protection under extreme conditions requires materials with excellent thermal insulation properties and exceptional mechanical properties to withstand a variety of complex external stresses. Mesoporous silica aerogels are the most widely used insulation materials due to their ultralow thermal conductivity. However, they still suffer from mechanical fragility and structural instability in practical applications. Herein, a nacre&#8208;mimetic nanocomposite aerogel, synthesized via in situ growth of inorganic minerals in a lamellar cellulose nanofibrous network, is reported. The multiscale structural adaptation of the inorganic&#8211;organic components endows nanocomposite aerogels with rapid configuration recovery during ambient pressure drying. The resulting aerogels show ultralow thermal conductivities (17.4&#160;mW&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1 at 1.0 atm). These aerogels also integrate challenging mechanical properties, including high compressive stiffness to resist deformation under the pressure of an adult, superelasticity to prevent static and dynamic stress cracking even under the crushing of a vehicle (1.6 t), and high bending flexibility to adapt to any surface. Moreover, they exhibit excellent structural stability under fatigue stress/strain cycles over a wide temperature range (&#8722;196 to 200&#160;&#176;C). The combination of high thermal insulation performance and excellent mechanical properties offers a potential material system for robust thermal superinsulation under extreme conditions, especially for aerospace applications.

         <title>Ultrafast Superfilling Construction of a Metal Artificial Interface for Long&#8208;Term Stable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superfilling strategy using thiourea molecules for kinetic regulation is demonstrated as an effective approach for constructing metal artificial interfaces. Owing to the coordination of thiourea molecules with metal ions, instantaneous nucleation of Sn is regulated into progressive nucleation. The constructed Sn@Zn anode is conducive to uniform nucleation and 2D&#160;diffusion growth of zinc during the battery cycling.








Abstract
Zinc (Zn)&#8208;metal anodes are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale, highly safe energy&#8208;storage systems. However, their cycling life is associated with instability issues such as dendritic growth, corrosion, and hydrogen evolution. Introducing an artificial metal interface is expected to help overcome this challenge owing to the optimization of the absorption, nucleation, and growth of Zn2+. In this study, an ultrafast, universal, and cost&#8208;effective superfilling approach is developed to construct a metal artificial interface decorated Zn anode in situ. Most zincophilic metals, including Sn, Cu, and Ag, can be used to construct a homogenous interface without any restrictions on the size, morphology, or curvature of the substrates. With Sn as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, the as&#8208;obtained Sn@Zn anode is conducive for the homogenous Zn nuclei and 2D&#160;diffusion of Zn2+ ions. Symmetric cells with Sn@Zn electrodes can be operated for over 900&#160;h at different current densities. This superior performance contributes to the attractive electrochemical characteristics of both coin and scaled&#8208;up Sn@Zn//&#946;&#8208;MnO2 cells. Given the facile and cost&#8208;effective fabrication and recyclability of the cells, this work enables the efficient design and exploration of Zn anodes for research, industrialization, and commercialization purposes.

         <title>Incorporating Wireless Strategies to Wearable Devices Enabled by a Photocurable Hydrogel&#160;for Monitoring Pressure Information</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photocurable hydrogel is developed to implement a two&#8208;in&#8208;one wearable device with a simple structure, which can quantify and visualize pressure simultaneously. Incorporated with wireless strategies, two integrated systems of smart patch and passive sensing are demonstrated, showing the potential for timely and on&#8208;site monitoring of physiological signals, and human&#8211;machine interfaces for various pressure information acquisition.








Abstract
Advances in emerging technologies for wireless collection and the timely analysis of various information captured by wearable devices are of growing interest. Herein, a crosslinked ionic hydrogel prepared by a facile photocuring process is proposed, which&#160;allows wearable devices to be further incorporated into two wireless integrated systems for pressure monitoring applications. The device exhibits a simplified structure by effectively sharing functional layers, rather than conventional two separate combinations, offering the salient performance of iontronic sensing and electrochromic properties to simultaneously quantify and visualize pressure. The developed smart patch system is demonstrated to monitor physiological signals in real&#8208;time utilizing the user interface of remote portable equipment with the Bluetooth protocol and on&#8208;site electrochromic displays. Moreover, a passive wireless system based on the magnetic coupling effect is designed, which can operate free from the battery and simultaneously acquire multiple pressure information. It is envisioned that the strategies would hold enormous potential for flexible electronics, versatile sensing platforms, and wireless on&#8208;body networks.

         <title>Modulating Oxygen Vacancies in Lead Chromate for&#160;Photoelectrocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using lead chromate (PbCrO4) as a prototype, oxygen vacancies are found to introduce shallow energy levels, and deep energy levels are identified. More surface oxygen vacancies induces the formation of deeper surface trapped states to enhance charge separation and introduce more low&#8208;oxygen&#8208;coordinated Cr centers to boost water oxidation activity.








Abstract
Although modulating oxygen vacancies in semiconductors has attracted broad interest in photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis, identifying the intrinsic roles of oxygen vacancies on photoelectrocatalytic properties is often elusive. In this work, the oxygen vacancies in a typical semiconductor lead chromate (PbCrO4) are regulated via controlling the oxygen chemical potentials of O&#8208;poor and O&#8208;rich post&#8208;annealing atmospheres. Oxygen vacancies identified in PbCrO4 can introduce electronically shallow energy levels and deep energy levels owing to the symmetry difference of oxygen atoms in the structure. A higher population of deep energy levels created under O&#8208;poor atmosphere induces the formation of more surface trapped states, resulting in a higher photovoltage for charge separation. Meanwhile, the existence of surface trapped states can significantly improve the charge injection efficiency of the PbCrO4 photoanode and enhance the water oxidation activity. By modulating oxygen vacancies in the PbCrO4 photoanode, a photocurrent density of 3.43&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under simulated AM1.5G is acheived. Further passivation of surface trapped states and introducing the water oxidation cocatalyst CoPi lead to a record applied bias photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency (ABPE) of 1.12%. This work provides a guide to understand the mechanism of oxygen vacancies in oxide&#8208;based semiconductor photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis.

         <title>Enzymatic Regulation of Protein&#8211;Protein Interactions in Artificial Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 scaffold protein is loaded in coacervate&#8208;based artificial cells, and client proteins are taken up based on their affinity for 14&#8208;3&#8208;3, which can be regulated by their phosphorylation state. Using a kinase or phosphatase, protein&#8211;protein interactions of native interaction domains are regulated in situ. This system mimics the recruitment of client proteins to biomolecular condensates.








Abstract
Membraneless organelles are important for spatial organization of proteins and regulation of intracellular processes. Proteins can be recruited to these condensates by specific protein&#8211;protein or protein&#8211;nucleic acid interactions, which are often regulated by post&#8208;translational modifications. However, the mechanisms behind these dynamic, affinity&#8208;based protein recruitment events are not well understood. Here, a coacervate system that incorporates the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 scaffold protein to study enzymatically regulated recruitment of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#8208;binding proteins is presented, which mostly bind in a phosphorylation&#8208;dependent manner. Synthetic coacervates are efficiently loaded with 14&#8208;3&#8208;3, and phosphorylated binding partners, such as the c&#8208;Raf pS233/pS259 peptide (c&#8208;Raf), show 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#8208;dependent sequestration with up to 161&#8208;fold increase in local concentration. The c&#8208;Raf domain is fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP&#8208;c&#8208;Raf) to demonstrate recruitment of proteins. In situ phosphorylation of GFP&#8208;c&#8208;Raf by a kinase leads to enzymatically regulated uptake. The introduction of a phosphatase into coacervates preloaded with the phosphorylated 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#8208;GFP&#8208;c&#8208;Raf complex results in a significant cargo efflux mediated by dephosphorylation. Finally, the general applicability of this platform to study protein&#8211;protein interactions is demonstrated by the phosphorylation&#8208;dependent and 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#8208;mediated active reconstitution of a split&#8208;luciferase inside artificial cells. This work presents an approach to study dynamically regulated protein recruitment in condensates, using native interaction domains.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Depolymerizable &#948;&#8208;Lactone Based Vitrimers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Depolymerizable vitrimers are developed through a one&#8208;pot synthesis approach. The low&#8208;ceiling&#8208;temperature polymer from the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of the biobased &#948;&#8208;lactone is cross&#8208;linked with dynamic acetal linkages. The cross&#8208;linked vitrimer allows reprocessing and healing and can easily depolymerize back to monomers for closed&#8208;loop recycling. These vitrimers exhibit excellent properties, making them a biobased and sustainable replacement for conventional soft elastomers.








Abstract
A depolymerizable vitrimer that allows both reprocessability and monomer recovery by a simple and scalable one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step synthesis of vitrimers from cyclic lactones is reported. Biobased &#948;&#8208;valerolactone with alkyl substituents (&#948;&#8208;lactone) has low ceiling temperature; thus, their ring&#8208;opening&#8208;polymerized aliphatic polyesters are capable of depolymerizing back to monomers. In this work, the amorphous poly(&#948;&#8208;lactone) is solidified into an elastomer (i.e., &#948;&#8208;lactone vitrimer) by a vinyl ether cross&#8208;linker with dynamic acetal linkages, giving the merits of reprocessing and healing. Thermolysis of the bulk &#948;&#8208;lactone vitrimer at 200&#160;&#176;C can recover 85&#8211;90&#160;wt% of the material, allowing reuse without losing value and achieving a successful closed&#8208;loop life cycle. It further demonstrates that the new vitrimer has excellent properties, with the potential to serve as a biobased and sustainable replacement of conventional soft elastomers for various applications such as lenses, mold materials, soft robots, and microfluidic devices.

         <title>Mechanically Responsive Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Cellulose&#8208;Nanocrystal&#8208;Based Shape&#8208;Memory Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cellulose nanocrystal (CNC)&#8208;based luminescent shape&#8208;memory polymers are fabricated by integrating the self&#8208;assembly of CNCs with a co&#8208;polymerization strategy. By sequential hot&#8208;pressing and recovery through heating, circularly polarized luminescence can be switched on and off due to the pressure&#8208;responsive chiral nematic structures.








Abstract
Stimulus&#8208;responsive materials that display circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) have attracted great attention for application in chiral sensors and smart displays. However, due to difficulties in the regulation of chiral structures, fine control of CPL remains a challenge. Here, it is demonstrated that cellulose nanocrystal shape&#8208;memory polymers (CNC&#8208;SMPs) with luminescent components enable mechanically responsive CPL. The chiral nematic organization of CNCs in the material gives rise to a photonic bandgap. By manipulating the photonic bandgap or luminescence wavelengths of the luminescent CNC&#8208;SMPs, precise control of CPL emission with varied wavelengths and high dissymmetry factors (glum) is achieved. Specifically, CPL emission can be switched reversibly by treating the luminescent CNC&#8208;SMPs with hot&#8208;pressing and recovery by heating. Pressure&#8208;responsive CPL with tunable glum values is ascribed to the pressure&#8208;responsive photonic bandgaps. Moreover, colorimetric and CPL&#8208;active patterns are created by imprinting desired forms into SMP samples. This study demonstrates a novel way to fabricate smart CPL systems using biomaterials.

         <title>Synchronous Interventions of Glucose and Mitochondrial Metabolisms for Antitumor Bioenergetic Therapy</title>

A glycopolymer containing a caged hydrogen sulfide and hydrogen peroxide dual&#8208;donor is synthesized to wrap glucose oxidase for synchronous interventions of glucose and mitochondrial metabolisms of tumors.








Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S)&#8208;based mitochondrial bioenergetic intervention is an attractive therapeutic modality. However, its therapeutic efficacy is limited owing to metabolic plasticity, which allows tumors to shift their metabolic phenotype between oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis for energy compensation. To overcome this flexibility, a glycopolymer containing a caged H2S and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) dual&#8208;donor (1&#8208;thio&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucose [thioglucose]) is synthesized to wrap glucose oxidase (GOx) for complete depletion of tumorigenic energy sources. The loaded GOx catalyzes the glutathione&#8208;activated thioglucose to generate cytotoxic H2S/H2O2, which further induces synergistic defects in mitochondrial function by suppressing cytochrome&#160;c oxidase expression and damaging the mitochondrial membrane potential. GOx also blocks glycolysis by depleting endogenous glucose. This synchronous intervention strategy exhibits good anticancer performance, broadening the horizon of antitumor bioenergetic therapy.

         <title>Achieving Practical High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries by a Dual&#8208;Anion Regulated Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;anion regulated electrolyte&#160;is developed for practical lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). The electrolyte enables fast interfacial kinetics and forms robust inorganic&#8208;rich and highly ion&#8208;conductive electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphase layers on the surfaces of the electrodes, demonstrates exceptional performance in Li||NCM83 pouch cells, and realizes LMBs&#160;with an ultrahigh capacity of 39.0 Ah and ultrahigh energy density of 521&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) using lithium&#8208;metal anodes and high&#8208;voltage cathodes have been deemed as one of the most promising high&#8208;energy&#8208;density battery technology. However, its practical application is largely hindered by the notorious dendrite growth of lithium&#8208;metal anodes, the fast structure degradation of the cathode, and insufficient electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphase kinetics. Here, a dual&#8208;anion regulated electrolyte is developed for LMBs using lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and lithium difluoro(bisoxalato)phosphate (LiDFBOP) as anion regulators. The incorporation of TFSI&#8722; in the solvation sheath reduces the desolvation energy of Li+, and DFBOP&#8722; promotes the formation of highly ion&#8208;conductive and sustainable inorganic&#8208;rich interphases on the electrodes. Significantly enhanced performance is demonstrated on Li||LiNi0.83Co0.11Mn0.06O2 pouch cells, with 84.6% capacity retention after 150 cycles in 6.0 Ah pouch cells and an ultrahigh rate capability up to 5 C in 2.0 Ah pouch cells. Furthermore, a pouch cell with an ultralarge capacity of 39.0 Ah is fabricated and achieves an ultrahigh energy density of 521.3&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. The findings provide a facile electrolyte design strategy for promoting the practical utilization of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LMBs.

         <title>Shift&#8208;Current Photovoltaics Based on a Non&#8208;Centrosymmetric Phase in In&#8208;Plane Ferroelectric SnS</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;centrosymmetric layer stacking phase of 2D tin sulfide (SnS) is successfully achieved on van der Waals substrates and the shift current in SnS is demonstrated. Following the PFM observation that reveals the existence of ferroelectric domains, an atomic model of the ferroelectric domain boundary is proposed.








Abstract
The shift&#8208;current photovoltaics of group&#8208;IV monochalcogenides has been predicted to be comparable to those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Si&#8208;based solar cells. However, its exploration has been prevented from the centrosymmetric layer stacking in the thermodynamically stable bulk crystal. Herein, the non&#8208;centrosymmetric layer stacking of tin sulfide (SnS) is stabilized in the bottom regions of SnS crystals grown on a van der Waals substrate by physical vapor deposition and the shift current of SnS, by combining the polarization angle dependence and circular photogalvanic effect, is demonstrated. Furthermore, 180&#176; ferroelectric domains in SnS are verified through both piezoresponse force microscopy and shift&#8208;current mapping techniques. Based on these results, an atomic model of the ferroelectric domain boundary is proposed. The direct observation of shift current and ferroelectric domains reported herein paves a new path for future studies on shift&#8208;current photovoltaics.

         <title>Enhancing Prosthetic Control through High&#8208;Fidelity Myoelectric Mapping with Molecular Anchoring Technology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy, molecular anchoring, is applied to improve the detection and quality of low&#8208;level myoelectric signals through gel electrode interacting with and embedding into stratum corneum. Due to high&#8208;fidelity signals based on the anchoring electrodes, the system enables an amputee to drive a prosthesis with phantom limb dexterity.








Abstract
Myoelectric control utilizes electrical signals generated from the voluntary contraction of remaining muscles in an amputee's stump to operate a prosthesis. Precise and agile control requires low&#8208;level myoelectric signals (below 10% of maximum voluntary contraction, MVC) from weak muscle contractions such as phantom finger or wrist movements, but imbalanced calcium concentration in atrophic skin can distort the signals. This is due to poor ionic&#8211;electronic coupling between skin and electrode, which often causes excessive muscle contraction, fatigue, and discomfort during delicate tasks. To overcome this challenge, a new strategy called molecular anchoring is developed to drive hydrophobic molecular effectively interact with and embed into stratum corneum for high coupling regions between ionic fluxes and electronic currents. The use of hydrophobic poly(N&#8208;vinyl caprolactam) gel has resulted in an interface impedance of 20&#160;k&#937;, which is 1/100 of a commercial acrylic&#8208;based electrode, allowing the detection of ultralow myoelectric signals (&#8776;1.5% MVC) that approach human limits. With this molecular anchoring technology, amputees operate a prosthesis with greater dexterity, as phantom finger and wrist movements are predicted with 97.6% accuracy. This strategy provides the potential for a comfortable human&#8211;machine interface when amputees accomplish day&#8208;to&#8208;day tasks through precise and dexterous myoelectric control.

         <title>Physicochemical Dual Cross&#8208;Linking Conductive Polymeric Networks Combining High Strength and High Toughness Enable Stable Operation of Silicon Microparticle Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A physicochemical dual cross&#8208;linking conductive polymeric network coupling the stiffness of poly(acrylic acid) and the softness of carboxyl nitrile rubber includes robust chemical cross&#8208;linking and multiple physical cross&#8208;linking. Such a design can effectively dissipate the undesirable stress of silicon microparticle anodes by folded molecular chains slipping and sequential cleavage of H&#8208;bonds, thus stabilizing the electrode interface and enhancing cycle stability.








Abstract
The poor interfacial stability and insufficient cycling performance caused by undesirable stress hinder the commercial application of silicon microparticles (&#181;Si) as next&#8208;generation anode materials for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, a conceptionally novel physicochemical dual cross&#8208;linking conductive polymeric network is designed combining high strength and high toughness by coupling the stiffness of poly(acrylic acid)&#160;and the softness of carboxyl nitrile rubber, which includes multiple H&#8208;bonds, by introducing highly branched tannic acid as a physical cross&#8208;linker. Such a design enables effective stress dissipation by folded molecular chains slipping and sequential cleavage of H&#8208;bonds, thus stabilizing the electrode interface and enhancing cycle stability. As expected, the resultant electrode (&#181;Si/PTBR) delivers an unprecedented high capacity retention of &#8776;97% from 2027.9 mAh g&#8722;1 at the 19th to 1968.0 mAh g&#8722;1 at the 200th cycle at 2 A g&#8722;1. Meanwhile, this unique stress dissipation strategy is also suitable for stabilizing SiOx anodes with a much lower capacity loss of &#8776;0.012% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1.5 A g&#8722;1. Atomic force microscopy analysis and finite element simulations reveal the excellent stress&#8208;distribution ability of the physicochemical dual cross&#8208;linking conductive polymeric network.

&lt;p&gt;A physicochemical dual cross-linking conductive polymeric network coupling the stiffness of poly(acrylic acid) and the softness of carboxyl nitrile rubber includes robust chemical cross-linking and multiple physical cross-linking. Such a design can effectively dissipate the undesirable stress of silicon microparticle anodes by folded molecular chains slipping and sequential cleavage of H-bonds, thus stabilizing the electrode interface and enhancing cycle stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poor interfacial stability and insufficient cycling performance caused by undesirable stress hinder the commercial application of silicon microparticles (&#181;Si) as next-generation anode materials for high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries. Herein, a conceptionally novel physicochemical dual cross-linking conductive polymeric network is designed combining high strength and high toughness by coupling the stiffness of poly(acrylic acid)&#160;and the softness of carboxyl nitrile rubber, which includes multiple H-bonds, by introducing highly branched tannic acid as a physical cross-linker. Such a design enables effective stress dissipation by folded molecular chains slipping and sequential cleavage of H-bonds, thus stabilizing the electrode interface and enhancing cycle stability. As expected, the resultant electrode (&#181;Si/PTBR) delivers an unprecedented high capacity retention of &#8776;97% from 2027.9 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at the 19th to 1968.0 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at the 200th cycle at 2 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Meanwhile, this unique stress dissipation strategy is also suitable for stabilizing SiO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; anodes with a much lower capacity loss of &#8776;0.012% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1.5 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Atomic force microscopy analysis and finite element simulations reveal the excellent stress-distribution ability of the physicochemical dual cross-linking conductive polymeric network. This work provides an efficient energy-dissipation strategy toward practical high-capacity anodes for energy-dense batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Energy Transfer between Dye&#8208;Loaded Nanoparticles: Observation and Amplified Detection of Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The operating range of F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer is fundamentally limited by the F&#246;rster radius of &#8776;5 nm. A study of dye&#8208;loaded fluorescent polymeric nanoparticles connected by DNA duplexes of different lengths reveals efficient energy transfer far beyond the F&#246;rster radius, following a power&#8208;four distance dependence. This phenomenon is applied for amplified detection of a target nucleic acid with attomole sensitivity.








Abstract
F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is essential in optical materials for light&#8208;harvesting, photovoltaics, and biosensing, but its operating range is fundamentally limited by the F&#246;rster radius of &#8776;5&#160;nm. In this work, FRET between fluorescent organic nanoparticles (NPs) is studied in order to break this limit. The donor and acceptor NPs are built from charged hydrophobic polymers loaded with cationic dyes and bulky hydrophobic counterions. Their surface is functionalized with DNA in order to control surface&#8208;to&#8208;surface distance. It is found that the FRET efficiency does not follow the canonic F&#246;rster law, reaching 0.70 and 0.45 values for NP&#8211;NP distances&#160;of 15 and 20&#160;nm, respectively. This corresponds to the FRET efficiency decay as power four of the surface&#8208;to&#8208;surface NP&#8211;NP distance. Based on this long&#8208;distance FRET, a DNA nanoprobe is developed, where a target DNA fragment, encoding the cancer marker survivin, bringing together donor and acceptor NPs at &#8776;15&#160;nm distance. In this nanoprobe, a single&#8208;molecular recognition results in unprecedented color switch for &gt;5000 dyes, yielding a simple and fast assay with 18 attomoles limit of detection. Breaking the F&#246;rster distance limit for ultrabright NPs opens the route to advanced optical nanomaterials for amplified FRET&#8208;based biosensing.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of High&#8208;Entropy Perovskite toward Highly Sensitive and Stable X&#8208;ray Flat&#8208;Panel Detectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile and scalable mechanochemical approach is developed for synthesizing stoichiometric high&#8208;entropy perovskite. This method has been utilized to create FAMACs thick&#8208;film&#8208;based X&#8208;ray FPD, which boosts exceptional sensitivity, ultralow detection limits, remarkable spatial resolution and superior thermal robustness. This significant advancement has the potential to accelerate the progress of next&#8208;generation X&#8208;ray detectors.








Abstract
Perovskites are attracting attention for optoelectronic devices. Despite their promise, the large&#8208;scale synthesis of perovskite materials with exact stoichiometry, especially high&#8208;entropy perovskites, has been a major challenge. Moreover, the difficulty in stoichiometry control also hinders the development of perovskite X&#8208;ray flat&#8208;panel detectors. Previous reports all employed simple MAPbI3 as the active layer, while the performance still falls short of optimized single&#8208;crystal&#8208;based single&#8208;pixel detectors. Herein, a scalable and universal strategy of a mechanochemical method is adopted to synthesize stoichiometric high&#8208;entropy perovskite powders with high quality and high quantity (&gt;1&#160;kg per batch). By utilizing these stoichiometric perovskites, the first FA0.9MA0.05Cs0.05Pb(I0.9Br0.1)3&#8208;based X&#8208;ray flat&#8208;panel detector with low trap density and large mobility&#8211;lifetime product (7.5 &#215; 10&#8722;3 cm2 V&#8722;1) is reported. The assembled panel detector exhibits close&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal performance (high sensitivity of 2.1 &#215; 104 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and&#160;ultralow detection limit of 1.25 nGyair s&#8722;1), high spatial resolution of 0.46 lp/pixel, as well as excellent thermal robustness under industrial standards. The high performance in the high&#8208;entropy perovskite&#8208;based X&#8208;ray FPDs has the potential to facilitate the development of new&#8208;generation&#160;X&#8208;ray&#8208;detection systems.

         <title>From Nanoalloy to Nano&#8208;Laminated Interfaces for Highly Stable Alkali&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept of organic and inorganic hybrid interfaces is proposed for both Li&#8208; and Na&#8208;metal anodes, tailoring the compositions from nanoalloy structure to nano&#8208;laminated structure. The required thicknesses for nanoalloy interfaces differ from Li&#8208; to Na&#8208;metal anodes, and the mechanical stabilities of the interfaces affect electrochemical performances.









Abstract
Metal anodes are considered the holy grail for next&#8208;generation batteries because of their high gravimetric/volumetric specific capacity and low electrochemical potential. However, several unsolved challenges have impeded their practical applications, such as dendrite growth, interfacial side reactions, dead layer formation, and volume change. An electrochemically, chemically, and mechanically stable artificial solid electrolyte interphase&#160;is key to addressing the aforementioned issue with metal anodes. This study demonstrates a new concept of organic and inorganic hybrid interfaces for both Li&#8208; and Na&#8208;metal anodes. Through tailoring the compositions of the hybrid interfaces, a nanoalloy structure to nano&#8208;laminated structure is realized. As a result, the nanoalloy interface (1Al2O3&#8211;1alucone or 2Al2O3&#8211;2alucone) presents the most stable electrochemical performances for both Li&#8208;and Na&#8208;metal anodes. The optimized thicknesses required for the nanoalloy interfaces for Li&#8208; and Na&#8208;metal anodes are different. A cohesive zone model is applied to interpret the underlying mechanism. Furthermore, the influence of the mechanical stabilities of the different interfaces on the electrochemical performances is investigated experimentally and theoretically. This approach provides a fundamental understanding and establishes the bridge between mechanical properties and electrochemical performance for alkali&#8208;metal anodes.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Specific Peroxynitrite Overproduction Disrupts Metabolic Homeostasis for Sensitizing Melanoma Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiple melanoma&#8208;characteristic stimuli&#8208;triggered tumor&#8208;specific ONOO&#8722; nanogenerator with high biocompatibility is presented, serving as a potent metabolic regulator with irreversible metabolic homeostasis disruption performances of tumor cells through the S&#8208;nitrosylation modification of key metabolic enzymes for the immunosuppressive TME reversion and ICB therapy sensitization of melanoma.








Abstract
Tumor cells elicit metabolic reprogramming to establish an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) for escaping from immunosurveillance. Therefore, interrupting the metabolic adaptation of tumor cells may be a promising strategy for TME immunomodulation, favoring immunotherapy. In this work, a tumor&#8208;specific peroxynitrite nanogenerator APAP&#8208;P&#8208;NO is constructed that can selectively disrupt metabolic homeostasis in melanoma cells. Stimulated by melanoma&#8208;characteristic acid, glutathione, and tyrosinase, APAP&#8208;P&#8208;NO can efficiently generate peroxynitrite through the in situ coupling of the produced superoxide anion and released nitric oxide. Metabolomics profiling reveals that the accumulated peroxynitrite induces a great decrease in metabolites in the tricarboxylic acid cycle.

&lt;p&gt;A multiple melanoma-characteristic stimuli-triggered tumor-specific ONOO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; nanogenerator with high biocompatibility is presented, serving as a potent metabolic regulator with irreversible metabolic homeostasis disruption performances of tumor cells through the S-nitrosylation modification of key metabolic enzymes for the immunosuppressive TME reversion and ICB therapy sensitization of melanoma.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tumor cells elicit metabolic reprogramming to establish an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) for escaping from immunosurveillance. Therefore, interrupting the metabolic adaptation of tumor cells may be a promising strategy for TME immunomodulation, favoring immunotherapy. In this work, a tumor-specific peroxynitrite nanogenerator APAP-P-NO is constructed that can selectively disrupt metabolic homeostasis in melanoma cells. Stimulated by melanoma-characteristic acid, glutathione, and tyrosinase, APAP-P-NO can efficiently generate peroxynitrite through the in situ coupling of the produced superoxide anion and released nitric oxide. Metabolomics profiling reveals that the accumulated peroxynitrite induces a great decrease in metabolites in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Meanwhile, the glycolysis-produced lactate drops sharply both intracellularly and extracellularly under peroxynitrite stress. Mechanistically, peroxynitrite impairs the activity of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in glucose metabolism through &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-nitrosylation. The metabolic alterations effectively reverse the immunosuppressive TME to evoke potent antitumor immune responses, including polarization of M2-like macrophages to M1phenotype, reduction of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells, and restoration of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell infiltration. Combining APAP-P-NO with anti-PD-L1 achieves a significant inhibition against both primary and metastatic melanomas without systemic toxicities. Collectively, a tumor-specific peroxynitrite overproduction approach is developed and the possible mechanism of peroxynitrite-mediated TME immunomodulation is explored, providing a new strategy for facilitating immunotherapy sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>All&#8208;Optical Multiplexed Meta&#8208;Differentiator for Tri&#8208;Mode Surface Morphology Observation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;optical multiplexed differentiator with a Malus metasurface consisting of single&#8208;sized nanostructures is reported. Experiments with Gaussian beams and biological specimens showcase its excellent computation performance and versatility of simultaneous outline detection and edge positioning. The approach provides a new route toward ultra&#8208;integration and multifunctionality of all&#8208;optical computing devices and the proposed meta&#8208;differentiator can find applications in various real&#8208;world scenarios.








Abstract
Current optical differentiators are generally limited to realizing a single differential function once fabricated. Herein, a minimalist strategy in designing multiplexed differentiators (1st&#8208; and 2nd&#8208;order differentiations), implemented with a Malus metasurface consisting of single&#8208;sized nanostructures is proposed, thus improving the functionality of optical computing devices without the cost of complex design and nanofabrication. It is found that the proposed meta&#8208;differentiator exhibits excellent differential&#8208;computation performance and can be used for simultaneous outline detection and edge positioning of objects, corresponding to the functions of the 1st&#8208; and 2nd&#8208;order differentiations respectively. Experiments with biological specimens showcase that boundaries of biological tissues can not only be identified, but also the edge information for realizing high&#8208;precision edge positioning is highlighted. The study provides a paradigm in designing all&#8208;optical multiplexed computing meta&#8208;devices, and initiates tri&#8208;mode surface morphology observation by combining meta&#8208;differentiator with optical microscopes, which can find their applications in advanced biological imaging, large&#8208;scale defect detection, and high&#8208;speed pattern recognition, etc.

         <title>Triggering Pt Active Sites in Basal Plane of Van der Waals PtTe2 Materials by Amorphization Engineering for Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient amorphous strategy is developed to trigger the reconfiguration of interlayer Pt atoms in 2D PtTe2 materials and tailor the electronic properties of Pt active sites via the orbital hybridization with oxygen dopants. O ur findings provide an efficient strategy for designing amorphous catalysts whose number of active sites and adsorption strength to reaction intermediates are significantly increased and optimized.








Abstract
Exposing active sites and optimizing their binding strength to reaction intermediates are two essential strategies to significantly improve the catalytic performance of 2D materials. However, pursuing an efficient way to achieve these goals simultaneously remains a considerable challenge. Here, using 2D PtTe2 van der Waals material with a well&#8208;defined crystal structure and atomically thin thickness as a model catalyst, it is observed that a moderate calcination strategy can promote the structural transformation of 2D crystal PtTe2 nanosheets (c&#8208;PtTe2 NSs) into oxygen&#8208;doped 2D amorphous PtTe2 NSs (a&#8208;PtTe2 NSs). The experimental and theoretical investigations cooperatively reveal that oxygen dopants can break the inherent Pt&#8208;Te covalent bond in c&#8208;PtTe2 NSs, thereby triggering the reconfiguration of interlayer Pt atoms and exposing them thoroughly. Meanwhile, the structural transformation can effectively tailor the electronic properties (e.g., the density of state near the Fermi level, d&#8208;band center, and conductivity) of Pt active sites via the hybridization of Pt 5d orbitals and O 2p orbitals. As a result, a&#8208;PtTe2 NSs with large amounts of exposed Pt active sites and optimized binding strength to hydrogen intermediates exhibit excellent activity and stability in hydrogen evolution reaction.

         <title>Saddle&#8208;Shaped Third Component with Out&#8208;of&#8208;Plane Electrostatic Dipole for Realizing High&#8208;Performance Photovoltaic Donor Terpolymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
PM6&#8208;based terpolymers containing a saddle&#8208;shaped group with a double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) as the third component designed for fabrication of polymer solar cells feature strong out&#8208;of&#8208;plane dipole for optimizing blend morphology and improving the photovoltaic performances, thus achieving 19.13% efficiency.








Abstract
Terpolymer fabrication is an effective methodology for molecular engineering and generating high&#8208;performance organic photovoltaic materials to construct highly efficient polymer solar cells. Modification of the polymer PM6 by incorporating a third component resulting in the formation of a ternary copolymer is reported to outperform PM6 in achieving enhanced device performances. However, one of the major challenges in constructing high&#8208;performance terpolymers is to counter the molecular disorder caused by the backbone entropy induced by the third moiety. In this work, double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) is used as the third component, which possesses a&#160;strong out&#8208;of&#8208;plane electrostatic dipole owing to the saddle&#8208;shaped B&#8592;N fused ring structure. The out&#8208;of&#8208;plane dipole moment introduced in the modified PM6 terpolymer can be used as a means for tuning and optimizing the nanostructures of the blended films. The prepared PM6&#8208;BNBP&#8208;4 blend polymer with 4% of the benzodithiophene dione monomers replaced by BNBP results in excellent power conversion efficiency of 19.13%. This work demonstrates that the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane electrostatic dipole moment in saddle&#8208;shaped molecules is valuable for achieving high&#8208;performance organic photovoltaic donor materials.

         <title>Remote Water&#8208;to&#8208;Air Eavesdropping with a Phase&#8208;Engineered Impedance Matching Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phase&#8208;engineered impedance matching metasurface is designed and experimentally demonstrated that serves as an &#8220;acoustic bridge&#8221; linking water and air nearly perfectly and enables remote and efficient water&#8208;to&#8208;air eavesdropping with extreme enhancement in sensitivity. This metasurface with near&#8208;unity transmission efficiency, long monitoring distance, and high mechanical stiffness opens an avenue to communication and sensing in inhomogeneities with totally reflective interfaces.








Abstract
Efficiently receiving underwater sound remotely from air is a long&#8208;standing challenge in acoustics hindered by the large impedance mismatch at the water&#8211;air interface. Here, a phase&#8208;engineered water&#8211;air impedance matching metasurface is proposed and experimentally demonstrated for remote and efficient water&#8208;to&#8208;air eavesdropping. The judiciously designed metasurface with near&#8208;unity transmission efficiency, long monitoring distance, and high mechanical stiffness is capable of making the water&#8211;air interface acoustically transparent and, at the same time, freewheelingly patterning the transmitted wavefront. This enables efficient control over the effective spatial location of a distant airborne sensor such that it can measure underwater signals with large signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios as if placed close to the physical underwater source. Such airborne eavesdropping of underwater sound is experimentally demonstrated with a measured sensitivity enhancement of nearly 104 at 8&#160;kHz, far from achievable with the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods. Moreover, the opportunities of using the proposed metasurface for cross&#8208;media orbital&#8208;angular&#8208;momentum&#8208;multiplexed communication and underwater acoustic window are also demonstrated. This metasurface opens new avenues for communication and sensing in inhomogeneities with totally reflective interfaces, which may be translated to nano&#8208;optics and radio frequencies.

Such airborne eavesdropping of underwater sound is experimentally demonstrated with a measured sensitivity enhancement of nearly 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; at 8&#160;kHz, far from achievable with the current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the opportunities of using the proposed metasurface for cross-media orbital-angular-momentum-multiplexed communication and underwater acoustic window are also demonstrated. This metasurface opens new avenues for communication and sensing in inhomogeneities with totally reflective interfaces, which may be translated to nano-optics and radio frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Doping of Halide Perovskites by Noble Metal Interstitial Cations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Control over doping of novel halide perovskite semiconductors has been a challenging research area, mainly due to the inability to directly measure and characterize defects. In this work, experimental and theoretical methods are combined to make a compelling case for the controlled, electrochemical formation of noble metal interstitial defects in halide perovskite materials, and their impact on n&#8208;type doping and optoelectronic properties is demonstrated.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites are an attractive class of semiconductors, but it has proven difficult to control their electronic doping by conventional strategies due to screening and compensation by mobile ions or ionic defects. Noble&#8208;metal interstitials represent an under&#8208;studied class of extrinsic defects that plausibly influence many perovskite&#8208;based devices. In this work, doping of metal halide perovskites is studied by electrochemically formed Au+ interstitial ions, combining experimental data on devices with a computational analysis of Au+ interstitial defects based on density functional theory (DFT). Analysis suggests that Au+ cations can be easily formed and migrate through the perovskite bulk via the same sites as iodine interstitials (Ii+). However, whereas Ii+ compensates n&#8208;type doping by electron capture, the noble&#8208;metal interstitials act as quasi&#8208;stable n&#8208;dopants. Experimentally, voltage&#8208;dependent, dynamic doping by current density&#8211;time (J&#8211;t), electrochemical impedance, and photoluminescence measurements are characterized. These results provide deeper insight into the potential beneficial and detrimental impacts of metal electrode reactions on long&#8208;term performance of perovskite photovoltaic and light&#8208;emitting diodes, as well as offer an alternative doping explanation for the valence switching mechanism of halide&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based neuromorphic and memristive devices.

         <title>X&#8208;ray&#8208;Induced Release of Nitric Oxide from Hafnium&#8208;Based Nanoradiosensitizers for Enhanced Radio&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple but multifunctional hafnium&#8208;based nanoradiosensitizer with controlled release of NO under X&#8208;ray irradiation and cGAS&#8208;STING pathway activation ability is developed for enhanced radio&#8208;immunotherapy, achieving complete elimination of cancer, especially metastasis.








Abstract
Radiotherapy (RT) is an extensively used strategy for cancer treatment, but its therapeutic effect is usually limited by the abnormal tumor microenvironment (TME) and it lacks the ability to control tumor metastases. In this work, a nanoscale coordination polymer, Hf&#8208;nIm@PEG (HNP), is prepared by the coordination of hafnium ions (Hf4+) with 2&#8208;nitroimidazole (2&#8208;nIm), and then modified with lipid bilayers containing poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). Under low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation, on the one hand, Hf4+ with high computed tomography signal enhancement ability can deposit radiation energy to induce DNA damage, and on the other hand, NO can be persistently released from 2&#8208;nIm, which can not only directly react with the radical DNA to prevent the repair of damaged DNA but also relieves the hypoxic immunosuppressive TME to sensitize radiotherapy. Additionally, NO can also react with superoxide ions to generate reactive nitrogen species (RNS) to induce cell apoptosis. More interestingly, it is discovered that Hf4+ can effectively activate the cyclic&#8208;di&#8208;GMP&#8208;AMP synthase (cGAS)&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway to promote the immune responses induced by radiotherapy. Thus, this work presents a simple but multifunctional nanoscale coordination polymer to deposit radiation energy, trigger the release of NO, modulate the TME, activate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, and finally realize synergistic radio&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>Azide&#8208;Masked Resiquimod Activated by Hypoxia for Selective Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel azide&#8208;masked resiquimod prodrug (R848&#8208;N3) is designed to block its active amino group, which can be selectively activated in hypoxic tumors. The combination of R848&#8208;N3 and polymer vascular disrupting agent (CA4&#8208;NPs) results in higher tumor selectivity than the intratumor (i.t.) injection of R848 and combination with anti&#8208;PD1 can achieve 40% tumor cure rate without obvious side effects.








Abstract
Resiquimod (R848) is an immunomodulator that causes a severe systemic inflammatory reaction due to low tumor selectivity, thus hindering its use in cancer therapy. Therefore, an azide&#8208;masked prodrug (R848&#8208;N3) of R848 is developed, which is selectively activated to R848 in hypoxic tumors. R848&#8208;N3 significantly reduces pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines in treated mice to 1/12 compared to R848 at the same dose. In addition, combretastatin A4 nanoparticles (CA4&#8208;NPs) are used to enhance the tumor selectivity of R848&#8208;N3 by elevating the level of tumor hypoxia. R848&#8208;N3+CA4&#8208;NPs has higher tumor selectivity than the intratumoral injection of R848 at 1&#160;h after administration. The concentration of the active R848 in the tumor is 21.45&#8208;fold that in the heart. Benefiting from the high tumor selectivity of R848&#8208;N3, R848&#8208;N3+CA4&#8208;NPs+anti&#8208;PD1 exerted 94.1% tumor suppression and 40.0% tumor cure. Therefore, this work highlights the potential of azide&#8208;masking strategy in the development of tumor&#8208;selective prodrugs with reduced toxicity.

         <title>Fluorescence&#8208;Amplified Origami Microneedle Device for Quantitatively Monitoring Blood Glucose</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through collaboratively integrating a microneedle patch and DNA&#8208;origami nanotubes, a fluorescence&#8208;amplified origami microneedle (FAOM) device enables the conversion from glucose to a proton signal. The proton&#8208;driven mechanical deformation of the DNA&#8208;origami structure leads to the fluorescence signal recovery. The FAOM device combines quantitative, accurate, trivially painful, and highly sensitive characteristics for real&#8208;time monitoring of blood glucose, thus improving test tolerance and patient's compliance.








Abstract
Exploration of clinically acceptable blood glucose monitors has been engaging in the past decades, yet the ability to quantitatively detect blood glucose in a painless, accurate, and highly sensitive manner remains limited. Herein, a fluorescence&#8208;amplified origami microneedle (FAOM) device is described that integrates tubular DNA&#8208;origami nanostructures and glucose oxidase molecules into its inner network to quantitatively monitor blood glucose. The skin&#8208;attached FAOM device can collect glucose molecules in situ and transfer the input into a proton signal after the oxidase's catalysis. The proton&#8208;driven mechanical reconfiguration of DNA&#8208;origami tubes separates fluorescent molecules and their quenchers, eventually amplifying the glucose&#8208;correlated fluorescence signal. The function equation established on clinical examinees suggests that FAOM can report blood glucose in a highly sensitive and quantitative manner. In clinical blind tests, the FAOM achieves well&#8208;matched accuracy (98.70&#160;&#177;&#160;4.77%) compared with a commercial blood biochemical analyzer, fully meeting the requirements of accurate blood glucose monitoring. The FAOM device can be inserted into skin tissue in a trivially painful manner and with minimal leakage of DNA origami, substantially improving the tolerance and compliance of the blood glucose test.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Soft Organogel Artificial Muscles Exhibiting High Power Density, Large Stroke, Fast Response and Long&#8208;Term Durability in Air</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A organogel artificial muscle is created through combining rational macromolecular design and twist insertion. Such tissue&#8208;like material (Young's modulus&#160;=&#160;133&#160;kPa) can generate ultra&#8208;large actuation strain (66%), ultra&#8208;fast actuation rate (275%&#160;s&#8722;1), high power density (438&#160;kW&#160;m&#8722;3), high actuation stress (0.23&#160;MPa), excellent work capacity (105&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;3), and highly stable actuation in the open&#8208;air environment.








Abstract
Polymeric gel&#8208;based artificial muscles exhibiting tissue&#8208;matched Young's modulus (10&#160;Pa&#8211;1&#160;MPa) promise to be core components in future soft machines with inherently safe human&#8211;machine interactions. However, the ability to simultaneously generate fast, large, high&#8208;power, and long&#8208;lasting actuation in the open&#8208;air environment, has yet been demonstrated in this class of ultra&#8208;soft materials. Herein, to overcome this hurdle, the design and synthesis of a twisted and coiled liquid crystalline glycerol&#8208;organogel (TCLCG) is reported. Such material with a low Young's modulus of 133&#160;kPa can surpass the actuation performance of skeletal muscles in a variety of aspects, including actuation strain (66%), actuation rate (275%&#160;s&#8722;1), power density (438&#160;kW&#160;m&#8722;3), and work capacity (105&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;3). Notably, its power density is 14 times higher than the record of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymeric gels. No actuation performance degradation is detected in the TCLCG even after air exposure for 7 days, owing to the excellent water retention ability enabled by glycerol as co&#8208;solvent with water. Using TCLCG, mobile soft robots with extraordinary maneuverability in unstructured environments are successfully demonstrated, including a crawler showing fast bidirectional locomotion (0.50&#160;mm&#160;s&#8722;1) in a small&#8208;confined space, and a roller that can escape after deep burying in sand.

A chimeric peptide nanoassembly consisting of a 14&#8208;carbon alkyl chain unit, a &#946;&#8208;sheet&#160;and pH&#8208;responsive unit, a P. aeruginosa target recognition unit, and a hydrophilic unit is developed. The nanoassemblies exhibit good bactericidal ability in acidic environments and are able to penetrate mature biofilms and kill drug&#8208;resistant bacteria. These results provide a reference for the development of peptide&#8208;based nanomaterials.








Abstract
Drug&#8208;resistant bacteria and biofilm&#8208;associated infections are prominent problems in the field of antibacterial medicine, seriously affecting human and animal health. Despite the great potential of nanomaterials in the antibacterial field, overcoming the paradox of size and charge, efficient penetration, and retention within biofilms remain a formidable challenge. Here, self&#8208;assembling chimeric peptide nanoassemblies composed of multiple functional fragments are designed for the treatment of drug&#8208;resistant bacteria and biofilm&#8208;associated infections. Notably, the chimeric peptide self&#8208;assembles into nanofibers at pH 7.4 and is transformable into nanoparticles in the acidic biofilm&#8208;infected microenvironment at pH 5.0, and thus achieves a size reduction and charge increase, improving the penetration into the bacterial biofilms and killing drug&#8208;resistant bacteria by a mechanism dominated by membrane cleavage. In vivo mouse and piglet infection models confirm the ability of chimeric peptide nanoassemblies to reduce bacterial load within biofilms. Collectively, this research on pathological&#8208;environment&#8208;driven nanostructural transformations may provide a theoretical basis for designing high&#8208;performance antibacterial nanomaterials and advance the application of peptide&#8208;based nanomaterials in medicine and animal husbandry.

         <title>Amorphous MoOx with High Oxophilicity Interfaced with PtMo Alloy Nanoparticles Boosts Anti&#8208;CO Hydrogen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept of amorphous MoOx with high oxophilicity interfaced with PtMo alloy for efficient hydrogen oxidation/evolution reaction is reported. It is demonstrated that the weakened Had binding energy and moderate hydroxyl adsorption energy can optimize the absorption behavior of key intermediates, jointly contributing to enhanced hydrogen electrocatalysis performance.








Abstract
Advancing electrocatalysts for alkaline hydrogen oxidation/evolution reaction (HOR/HER) is essential for anion exchange membrane&#8208;based devices. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts for alkaline HOR suffer from low intrinsic activities and severe CO poisoning due to the challenge of simultaneously optimizing surface adsorption toward different adsorbates. Herein, this challenge is overcome by tuning an atomic MoOx layer with high oxophilicity onto PtMo nanoparticles (NPs) with optimized Had, OHad, and COad adsorption for boosting anti&#8208;CO&#8208;poisoning hydrogen&#8208;cycle electrocatalysis in alkaline media. For alkaline HOR, this catalyst exhibits high kinetics and an exchange current density of 3.19&#160;mA&#160;&#181;gPt&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode and 0.83&#160;mA&#160;cmPt&#8722;2, 10.3&#8208; and 3.8&#8208;fold higher than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively. For alkaline HER, it achieves an unprecedented overpotential of 37&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Experimental and theoretical studies show that the orchestrated electronic and oxophilic regulation of the PtMo/MoOx interface NPs simultaneously optimizes Had and OHad adsorption for boosting alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis, whereas reactive oxygen from the amorphous MoOx atomic layer lowers the CO oxidation reaction barrier, leading to superior anti&#8208;poisoning ability even at 100&#160;ppm CO.

         <title>Giant Electrostrain in Lead&#8208;Free Textured Piezoceramics by Defect Dipole Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A giant electrostrain value as high as 1.6% with low hysteresis and excellent fatigue resistance is achieved in textured BNT&#8208;based lead&#8208;free ceramics through the synergistic contributions of the reversible electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced phase transition, grain orientation engineering, and, foremost, defect dipole engineering.









Abstract
By converting electrical signal into mechanical displacement, piezoelectric actuators are widely used in many applications due to their precise displacement, fast response, and small size. The unipolar electrostrain values larger than 1% reported so far are from lead&#8208;based single crystals or ceramics, which brings environmental concerns. Herein, a giant unipolar electrostrain of 1.6% with good fatigue resistance and low hysteresis in Sr/Nb&#8208;doped Bi0.5(Na0.82K0.18)0.5TiO3 lead&#8208;free textured piezoceramics by defect dipole design is reported, which is comparable to or even higher than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lead&#8208;based piezoelectric single crystals. The engineered defect dipoles in ergodic relaxor ferroelectrics can introduce a large internal bias field along the poling direction, where the &#12296;111&#12297;&#8208;oriented defect dipoles with large polarizability aligning along the &#12296;111&#12297;&#8208;oriented spontaneous polarizations of the electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced ferroelectric phase greatly benefit the reversible phase&#8208;transition process of the &#12296;00l&#12297;&#8208;textured ceramic. In&#8208;depth microstructural studies reveal that the greatly enhanced electrostrain is realized by the synergistic contributions from the reversible electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced phase transition, grain orientation engineering, and most importantly, defect dipole engineering. The present research provides a general strategy for the design of piezoceramics with high electrostrain, which is expected to be promising alternative to lead&#8208;based piezoelectric actuators.

The engineered defect dipoles in ergodic relaxor ferroelectrics can introduce a large internal bias field along the poling direction, where the &#12296;111&#12297;-oriented defect dipoles with large polarizability aligning along the &#12296;111&#12297;-oriented spontaneous polarizations of the electric-field-induced ferroelectric phase greatly benefit the reversible phase-transition process of the &#12296;00&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;&#12297;-textured ceramic. In-depth microstructural studies reveal that the greatly enhanced electrostrain is realized by the synergistic contributions from the reversible electric-field-induced phase transition, grain orientation engineering, and most importantly, defect dipole engineering. The present research provides a general strategy for the design of piezoceramics with high electrostrain, which is expected to be promising alternative to lead-based piezoelectric actuators.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive and Mechano&#8208;Actuated Biomimetic Membrane Nanopores Self&#8208;Assembled from DNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic nanopores of complex function&#160;are built with DNA nanotechnology. The pores undergo dynamic changes in shape and can be locked in an open state by specific binding of DNA and protein stimuli, and close at high transmembrane potentials. The pores may be used in biosensing and synthetic biology.








Abstract
In bioinspired design, biological templates are mimicked in structure and function by highly controllable synthetic means. Of interest are static barrel&#8208;like nanopores that enable molecular transport across membranes for use in biosensing, sequencing, and biotechnology. However, biological ion channels offer additional functions such as dynamic changes of the entire pore shape between open and closed states, and triggering of dynamic processes with biochemical and physical stimuli. To better capture this complexity, this report presents multi&#8208;stimuli and mechano&#8208;responsive biomimetic nanopores which are created with DNA nanotechnology. The nanopores switch between open and closed states, whereby specific binding of DNA and protein molecules as stimuli locks the pores in the open state. Furthermore, the physical stimulus of high transmembrane voltage switches the pores into a closed state. In addition, the pore diameters are larger and more tunable than those of natural templates. These multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive and mechanically actuated nanopores mimic several aspects of complex biological channels yet offer easier control over pore size, shape and stimulus response. The designer pores are expected to be applied in biosensing and synthetic biology.

         <title>A Functionalized Heterogeneous Catalyst from Atomically Precise Pd1Au8 Clusters Facilitates Carbon&#8211;Carbon Bond Construction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterogeneous catalyst is synthesized by exchanging Pd1Au8(PPh3)82+ clusters into the resin, realizing time&#8208;on&#8208;stream performance for the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction. Due to the defined coordination geometry and composition and ligand of this Pd1Au8(PPh3)82+ catalyst, fundamental understanding of the structure&#8211;activity relationship can be achieved.








Abstract
It has become possible to establish a connection between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis with atomically precise metal clusters. Due to their defined coordination geometry, in this work, atomically precise Pd1Au8(PPh3)82+ clusters are exploited to identify the crucial factor that can impact the catalytic efficiency for the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling process and further gain valuable insight into the exclusive cooperative effect of the central Pd atom and the peripheral Au atoms of the Pd1Au8(PPh3)82+ cluster on controlling the cross&#8208;coupling reaction. Specifically, a heterogeneous catalyst, namely Pd1Au8@Resin, is designed by exchanging positively charged Pd1Au8(PPh3)82+ clusters into the porous resin, thereby not only facilitating catalyst recyclability when performed in a batch reactor, but also realizing time&#8208;on&#8208;stream performance for the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction carried out in a fixed&#8208;bed reactor. The integrated advantages of homogeneous complexes and heterogeneous catalysts are expected to advance the usability of atomically precise metal clusters as heterogeneous catalysts for important bond constructions in homogeneous systems.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;Solid Aqueous Electrolytes for Low&#8208;Cost Sustainable Alkali&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water molecules trapped in carcerand&#8208;like networks lead to quasi&#8208;solid aqueous electrolytes, which are compatible with alkali metals with no gas evolution, high Coulombic efficiency of over 99%, and low cost. This work paves innovative ways for water&#8208;based, low&#8208;cost, sustainable batteries, and beyond.









Abstract
Aqueous electrolytes are highly important for batteries due to their sustainability, greenness, and low cost. However, the free water molecules react violently with alkali metals, rendering the high&#8208;capacity of alkali&#8208;metal anodes unusable. Here, water molecules are confined in a carcerand&#8208;like network to build quasi&#8208;solid aqueous electrolytes (QAEs) with reduced water molecules' freedom and matched with the low&#8208;cost chloride salts. The formed QAEs possess substantially different properties than liquid water molecules, including stable operation with alkali&#8208;metal anodes without gas evolution. Specifically, the alkali&#8208;metal anodes can directly cycle in a water&#8208;based environment with suppressed growth of dendrites, electrode dissolution, and polysulfide shuttle. Li&#8208;metal symmetric cells achieved long&#8208;term cycling over 7000&#160;h (and over 5000/4000&#160;h for Na/K symmetric cells), and all the Cu&#8208;based alkali&#8208;metal cells exhibited a Coulombic efficiency of over 99%. Full metal batteries, such as Li||S batteries, attained high Coulombic efficiency, long life (over 4000 cycles), and unprecedented energy density among water&#8208;based rechargeable batteries.

Battery Recycling
In article number 2211946, Bartosz A. Grzybowski and co&#8208;workers present a one&#8208;pot separation of metals from spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Three liquid layers occupy different segments of the rotating cylindrical vessel and are intensely stirred to move selected components between layers. In only ten minutes, all cobalt and manganese migrate from the feed to the acceptor layer (red), while lithium and nickel remain in the processed feed layer (green).

Li&#8208;Ion Battery Cathodes
In article 2212098, Jaekwang Lee, Sung&#8208;Yoon Chung, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that a significant amount of oxygen loss can be induced exclusively by lattice strain even in pristine layered oxides, LiCoO2 and Li2MnO3, without any electrochemical Li extraction. Calculations based on density functional theory also clarify that shear strain, among many different modes of mechanical strain, provide a major contribution to the energetically favorable formation of oxygen vacancies, critically supporting the experimental observations.

         <title>Interface Engineering Toward Expedited Li2S Deposition in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries: A Critical Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li2S deposition, the final discharge step contributing 75% capacity to Li&#8211;S batteries, remains a formidable issue due to its sluggish kinetics. The inferior deposition kinetics stem from the huge interfacial impedances, suggesting its interface&#8208;dominated nature. In this review, the progress and outlook of interface engineering for Li2S deposition, associated with the underlying mechanisms and potential problem&#8208;solving strategies, are reviewed.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs) with superior energy density are among the most promising candidates of next&#8208;generation energy storage techniques. As the key step contributing to 75% of the overall capacity, Li2S deposition remains a formidable challenge for LSBs applications because of its sluggish kinetics. The severe kinetic issue originates from the huge interfacial impedances, indicative of the interface&#8208;dominated nature of Li2S deposition. Accordingly, increasing efforts have been devoted to interface engineering for efficient Li2S deposition, which has attained inspiring success to date. However, a systematic overview and in&#8208;depth understanding of this critical field are still absent. In this review, the principles of interface&#8208;controlled Li2S precipitation are presented, clarifying the pivotal roles of electrolyte&#8211;substrate and electrolyte&#8211;Li2S interfaces in regulating Li2S depositing behavior. For the optimization of the electrolyte&#8211;substrate interface, efforts on the design of substrates including metal compounds, functionalized carbons, and organic compounds are systematically summarized. Regarding the regulation of electrolyte&#8211;Li2S interface, the progress of applying polysulfides catholytes, redox mediators, and high&#8208;donicity/polarity electrolytes is overviewed in detail. Finally, the challenges and possible solutions aiming at optimizing Li2S deposition are given for further development of practical LSBs. This review would inspire more insightful works and, more importantly, may enlighten other electrochemical areas concerning heterogeneous deposition processes.

The severe kinetic issue originates from the huge interfacial impedances, indicative of the interface-dominated nature of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S deposition. Accordingly, increasing efforts have been devoted to interface engineering for efficient Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S deposition, which has attained inspiring success to date. However, a systematic overview and in-depth understanding of this critical field are still absent. In this review, the principles of interface-controlled Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S precipitation are presented, clarifying the pivotal roles of electrolyte&#8211;substrate and electrolyte&#8211;Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S interfaces in regulating Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S depositing behavior. For the optimization of the electrolyte&#8211;substrate interface, efforts on the design of substrates including metal compounds, functionalized carbons, and organic compounds are systematically summarized. Regarding the regulation of electrolyte&#8211;Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S interface, the progress of applying polysulfides catholytes, redox mediators, and high-donicity/polarity electrolytes is overviewed in detail. Finally, the challenges and possible solutions aiming at optimizing Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S deposition are given for further development of practical LSBs. This review would inspire more insightful works and, more importantly, may enlighten other electrochemical areas concerning heterogeneous deposition processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Induced Spin Selectivity: An Enabling Technology for Quantum Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular spins are promising qudits but their weak interaction with external fields makes single&#8208;molecule readout challenging. A solution that exploits chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) in photoinduced electron transfer is envisioned in this work. Progress toward the detection of CISS at the molecular level by magnetic resonance is overviewed and it is shown how CISS could enable initialization, manipulation, and readout of molecular spins at high temperature.








Abstract
Molecular spins are promising building blocks of future quantum technologies thanks to the unparalleled flexibility provided by chemistry, which allows the design of complex structures targeted for specific applications. However, their weak interaction with external stimuli makes it difficult to access their state at the single&#8208;molecule level, a fundamental tool for their use, for example, in quantum computing and sensing. Here, an innovative solution exploiting the interplay between chirality and magnetism using the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity effect on electron transfer processes is foreseen. It is envisioned to use a spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion mechanism that can be realized by connecting a molecular spin qubit to a dyad where an electron donor and an electron acceptor are linked by a chiral bridge. By numerical simulations based on realistic parameters, it is shown that the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity effect could enable initialization, manipulation, and single&#8208;spin readout of molecular qubits and qudits even at relatively high temperatures.

         <title>Polarization Switching and Correlated Phase Transitions in Fluorite&#8208;Structure ZrO2 Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;dose integrated differential phase&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC&#8208;STEM) enables visualization of oxygen shifting during polarization switching and correlated polar&#8211;nonpolar phase transitions among multiple metastable phases in ZrO2 nanocrystals. Bidirectional transitions between antiferroelectric and ferroelectric orders and interfacial polarization relaxation are clarified at unit&#8208;cell scale. Meanwhile, polarization switching is strongly correlated with polar&#8211;nonpolar phase transitions among O/M/T phases.








Abstract
Unconventional ferroelectricity in fluorite&#8208;structure oxides enables tremendous opportunities in nanoelectronics owing to their superior scalability and silicon compatibility. However, their polarization order and switching process remain elusive due to the challenges of visualizing oxygen ions in nanocrystalline films. In this work, the oxygen shifting during polarization switching and correlated polar&#8211;nonpolar phase transitions are directly captured among multiple metastable phases in freestanding ZrO2 thin films by low&#8208;dose integrated differential phase&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC&#8208;STEM). Bidirectional transitions between antiferroelectric and ferroelectric orders and interfacial polarization relaxation are clarified at unit&#8208;cell scale. Meanwhile, polarization switching is strongly correlated with Zr&#8211;O displacement in reversible martensitic transformation between monoclinic and orthorhombic phases and two&#8208;step tetrahedral&#8208;to&#8208;orthorhombic phase transition. These findings provide atomic insights into the transition pathways between metastable polymorphs and unravel the evolution of polarization orders in (anti)ferroelectric fluorite oxides.

         <title>Engineered Extracellular Vesicles Derived from Dermal Fibroblasts Attenuate Inflammation in a Murine Model of Acute Lung Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered extracellular vesicles (eEVs) derived from adult dermal fibroblasts show enhanced intrapulmonary targeting and retention and can effectively deliver therapeutic cargo to the inflamed lung to reduce inflammation, mediate tissue repair, and drive metabolic changes that favor further activation of anti&#8208;inflammatory pathways. These eEVs could potentially represent a powerful tool for the treatment of acute lung injury.








Abstract
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represents a significant burden to the healthcare system, with &#8776;200&#160;000 cases diagnosed annually in the USA. ARDS patients suffer from severe refractory hypoxemia, alveolar&#8208;capillary barrier dysfunction, impaired surfactant function, and abnormal upregulation of inflammatory pathways that lead to intensive care unit admission, prolonged hospitalization, and increased disability&#8208;adjusted life years. Currently, there is no cure or FDA&#8208;approved therapy for ARDS. This work describes the implementation of engineered extracellular vesicle (eEV)&#8208;based nanocarriers for targeted nonviral delivery of anti&#8208;inflammatory payloads to the inflamed/injured lung. The results show the ability of surfactant protein A (SPA)&#8208;functionalized IL&#8208;4&#8208; and IL&#8208;10&#8208;loaded eEVs to promote intrapulmonary retention and reduce inflammation, both in vitro and in vivo. Significant attenuation is observed in tissue damage, proinflammatory cytokine secretion, macrophage activation, influx of protein&#8208;rich fluid, and neutrophil infiltration into the alveolar space as early as 6 h post&#8208;eEVs treatment. Additionally, metabolomics analyses show that eEV treatment causes significant changes in the metabolic profile of inflamed lungs, driving the secretion of key anti&#8208;inflammatory metabolites. Altogether, these results establish the potential of eEVs derived from dermal fibroblasts to reduce inflammation, tissue damage, and the prevalence/progression of injury during ARDS via nonviral delivery of anti&#8208;inflammatory genes/transcripts.

         <title>Bioinspired Processing: Complex Coacervates as Versatile Inks for 3D Bioprinting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D printable complex coacervate biomaterial inks composed of hyaluronic acid and chitosan are developed. Fine&#8208;tuning of the salt concentration, pH, and molecular weight of the polymers results in inks that are printable both in air and in water without the need for post&#8208;printing processing. Produced cell culture scaffolds are cytocompatible and show long&#8208;term topological stability.








Abstract
3D bioprinting is a powerful fabrication technique in biomedical engineering, which is currently limited by the number of available materials that meet all physicochemical and cytocompatibility requirements for biomaterial inks. Inspired by the key role of coacervation in the extrusion and spinning of many natural materials, hyaluronic acid&#8211;chitosan complex coacervates are proposed here as tunable biomaterial inks. Complex coacervates are obtained through an associative liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation driven by electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged macromolecules. They offer bioactive properties and facile modulation of their mechanical properties through mild physicochemical changes in the environment, making them attractive for 3D bioprinting. Fine&#8208;tuning the salt concentration, pH, and molecular weight of the constituent polymers results in biomaterial inks that are printable in air and water. The biomaterial ink, initially a viscoelastic fluid, transitions into a viscoelastic solid upon printing due to dehydration (for printing in air) or due to a change in pH and ionic composition (for printing in solution). Consequently, scaffolds printed using the complex coacervate inks are stable without the need for post&#8208;printing processing. Fabricated cell culture scaffolds are cytocompatible and show long&#8208;term topological stability. These results pave the way to a new class of easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle tunable biomaterials for biofabrication.

         <title>Flame Aerosol Synthesis of Metal Sulfides at High Temperature in Oxygen&#8208;Lean Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
As proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, the preparation of various metal sulfides in a flame process using single&#8208;droplet combustion and enclosed flame spray pyrolysis in O2&#8208;lean condition is demonstrated. Using a large&#8208;tube reactor MnS, CoS, Cu2S, ZnS, Ag2S, In2S3, SnS, and Bi2S3 are formed at a rate of 5 g h&#8722;1. The flame aerosol process is a key toward scalable synthesis of binary/ternary metal sulfides for next&#8208;generation functional materials.








Abstract
The development of a novel reactive spray technology based on the well&#8208;known gas&#8208;phase metal oxide synthesis route provides innumerable opportunities for the production of non&#8208;oxide nanoparticles. Among these materials, metal sulfides are expected to have a high impact, especially in the development of electrochemical and photochemical high&#8208;surface&#8208;area materials. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, MnS, CoS, Cu2S, ZnS, Ag2S, In2S3, SnS, and Bi2S3 are synthesized in an O2&#8208;lean and sulfur&#8208;rich environment. In addition, the formation of Cu2S in a single&#8208;droplet combustion experiment is reported. The multiscale approach combining flame sprays with single&#8208;droplet combustion is expected to pave the way toward a fundamental understanding of the gas&#8208;phase formation of metal sulfides in the future. The knowledge acquired can open the possibility for the development of a next&#8208;generation gas&#8208;phase technology facilitating the scalable synthesis of functional binary/ternary metal sulfides.

         <title>Stabilization of FAPbI3 with Multifunctional Alkali&#8208;Functionalized Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy to manipulate the crystallization process of FAPbI3&#8208;rich perovskite by incorporating a small amount of alkali&#8208;functionalized polymers into the antisolvent solution is reported. Rubidium&#8208;functionalized poly(acrylic acid) (Rb&#8208;PAA) significantly improves the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells to approaching 25% with enhanced operational stability.









Abstract
The defects located at the interfaces and grain boundaries (GBs) of perovskite films are detrimental to the photovoltaic performance and stability of perovskite solar cells. Manipulating the perovskite crystallization process and tailoring the interfaces with molecular passivators are the main effective strategies to mitigate performance loss and instability. Herein, a new strategy is reported to manipulate the crystallization process of FAPbI3&#8208;rich perovskite by incorporating a small amount of alkali&#8208;functionalized polymers into the antisolvent solution. The synergic effects of the alkali cations and poly(acrylic acid) anion effectively passivate the defects on the surface and GBs of perovskite films. As a result, the rubidium (Rb)&#8208;functionalized poly(acrylic acid) significantly improves the power conversion efficiency of FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells to approaching 25% and reduces the risk of lead ion (Pb2+) leakage continuously&#160;via the strong interaction between C&#63742;O bonds and Pb2+. In addition, the unencapsulated device shows enhanced operational stability, retaining 80% of its initial efficiency after 500&#160;h operation at maximum power point under one&#8208;sun illumination.

         <title>Interstitial Segregation has the Potential to Mitigate Liquid Metal Embrittlement in Iron</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic&#8208;resolution probing techniques reveal the formation of a nanoscale segregation pattern of zinc in a body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic iron grain boundary (GB) decorated by boron and carbon. Ab initio calculations show that boron and carbon hinder zinc segregation and compensate for the zinc&#8208;induced loss in GB cohesion.








Abstract
The embrittlement of metallic alloys by liquid metals leads to catastrophic material failure and severely impacts their structural integrity. The weakening of grain boundaries (GBs) by the ingress of liquid metal and preceding segregation in the solid are thought to promote early fracture. However, the potential of balancing between the segregation of cohesion&#8208;enhancing interstitial solutes and embrittling elements inducing GB de&#8208;cohesion is not understood. Here, the mechanisms of how boron segregation mitigates the detrimental effects of the prime embrittler, zinc, in a &#931;5&#8201;[001] tilt GB in &#945;&#8208;Fe (4 at.% Al) is unveiled. Zinc forms nanoscale segregation patterns inducing structurally and compositionally complex GB states. Ab initio simulations reveal that boron hinders zinc segregation and compensates for the zinc&#8208;induced loss in GB cohesion. The work sheds new light on how interstitial solutes intimately modify GBs, thereby opening pathways to use them as dopants for preventing disastrous material failure.

         <title>Understanding the Interfacial Reactions and Band Alignment for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells Built on Metal Substrates with Reduced Upscaling Losses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new understanding and architecture enabling efficient and stable perovskite solar cells built on metal substrates is presented. The efficiency and fill&#8208;factor losses due to area upscaling are remarkably reduced by one order of magnitude relative to the counterparts on conventional transparent conductive oxide (TCO) glass, highlighting an alternative pathway for upscaling and module design.








Abstract
Conventional perovskite solar cells (PSC) built on transparent conductive oxide (TCO) glass face a fundamental challenge to retain fill factor (FF) for large&#8208;area upscaling due to series resistance loss. Building a perovskite solar cell on metal has the potential to reduce this FF loss and is promising for flexible applications. However, their efficiency and stability lag far behind their TCO counterparts. Herein, findings on the complex chemical reactions and degradation&#8208;promoting processes at different perovskite/metal (Cu, Au, Ag, and Mo) interfaces, which are closely linked with the inherent stability; and the interlayer engineering for perovskite/metal interface's band alignment, which plays an essential role in achieving high efficiency, are reported. Leveraging these findings, 21% power conversion efficiency (PCE) is achieved for 1 cm2 perovskite solar cells using a p&#8211;i&#8211;n top&#8208;illumination structure on a molybdenum substrate, the highest reported for a PSC built on metal. Notably, the FF and PCE losses due to area upscaling are remarkably reduced by one order of magnitude relative to the counterparts on conventional TCO glass, highlighting an alternative pathway for PSC upscaling and module design.

         <title>Ultralong Carrier Lifetime Exceeding 20 &#181;s in Lead Halide Perovskite Film Enable Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By regulating the electronic structure with ThFABr, an ultralong carrier lifetime exceeding 20 &#181;s and carrier diffusion lengths longer than 6.5&#160;&#181;m is achieved in 2D/3D polycrystalline perovskite films. These excellent properties enable the ThFA&#8208;based devices yielding a champion efficiency of 24.69% and a high VOC of 1.21&#160;V, coupled with significantly improved operational stability.








Abstract
The carrier lifetime is one of the key parameters for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, it is still a great challenge to achieve long carrier lifetimes in perovskite films that are comparable with perovskite crystals owning to the large trap density resulting from the unavoidable defects in grain boundaries and surfaces. Here, by regulating the electronic structure with the developed 2&#8208;thiopheneformamidinium bromide (ThFABr) combined with the unique film structure of 2D perovskite layer caped 2D/3D polycrystalline perovskite film, an ultralong carrier lifetime exceeding 20 &#181;s and carrier diffusion lengths longer than 6.5&#160;&#181;m are achieved. These excellent properties enable the ThFA&#8208;based devices to yield a champion efficiency of 24.69% with a minimum VOC loss of 0.33&#160;V. The unencapsulated device retains &#8776;95% of its initial efficiency after 1180&#160;h by max power point (MPP) tracking under continuous light illumination. This work provides important implications for structured 2D/(2D/3D) perovskite films combined with unique FA&#8208;based spacers to achieve ultralong carrier lifetime for high&#8208;performance PSCs and other optoelectronic applications.

These excellent properties enable the ThFA-based devices yielding a champion efficiency of 24.69% and a high &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; of 1.21&#160;V, coupled with significantly improved operational stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The carrier lifetime is one of the key parameters for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, it is still a great challenge to achieve long carrier lifetimes in perovskite films that are comparable with perovskite crystals owning to the large trap density resulting from the unavoidable defects in grain boundaries and surfaces. Here, by regulating the electronic structure with the developed 2-thiopheneformamidinium bromide (ThFABr) combined with the unique film structure of 2D perovskite layer caped 2D/3D polycrystalline perovskite film, an ultralong carrier lifetime exceeding 20 &#181;s and carrier diffusion lengths longer than 6.5&#160;&#181;m are achieved. These excellent properties enable the ThFA-based devices to yield a champion efficiency of 24.69% with a minimum &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; loss of 0.33&#160;V. The unencapsulated device retains &#8776;95% of its initial efficiency after 1180&#160;h by max power point (MPP) tracking under continuous light illumination. This work provides important implications for structured 2D/(2D/3D) perovskite films combined with unique FA-based spacers to achieve ultralong carrier lifetime for high-performance PSCs and other optoelectronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inhibition of Tumor Metastasis by Liquid&#8208;Nitrogen&#8208;Shocked Tumor Cells with Oncolytic Viruses Infection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A virus&#8208;concealed tumor&#8208;targeting strategy enabling oncolytic virus delivery toward lung metastasis via systemic administration is described. The virus can actively infect, be internalized, and cloak into tumor cells; then, the tumor cells are subsequently treated with liquid&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;shocking to eliminate the pathogenicity. Such a Trojan Horse&#8208;like vehicle avoids virus neutralization and clearance in the bloodstream and facilitates tumor&#8208;targeted delivery.








Abstract
Despite the superior tumor lytic efficacy of oncolytic viruses (OVs), their systemic delivery still faces the challenges of limited circulating periods, poor tumor tropism, and spontaneous antiviral immune responses. Herein, a virus&#8208;concealed tumor&#8208;targeting strategy enabling OVs&#8216; delivery toward lung metastasis via systemic administration is described. The OVs can actively infect, be internalized, and cloak into tumor cells. Then the tumor cells are subsequently treated with liquid&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;shocking to eliminate the pathogenicity. Such a Trojan Horse&#8208;like vehicle avoids virus neutralization and clearance in the bloodstream and facilitates tumor&#8208;targeted delivery for more than 110&#8208;fold virus enrichment in the tumor metastasis. In addition, this strategy can serve as a tumor vaccine and initiate endogenous adaptive antitumor effects through increasing the memory T cells and modulating the tumor immune microenvironment, including reducing the M2 macrophage, downregulating Treg cells, and priming T cells.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Light Accelerated Prodrug Reduction of Pt(IV)&#8208;Incorporating Pseudo Semiconducting Polymers for Robust Degradation and Maximized Photothermal/Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>

NIR&#8208;II light accelerated prodrug reduction of Pt(IV) nanoparticles is studied&#160;by co&#8208;assembling a pseudo&#8208;conjugated&#8208;polymer with Oxa(IV) in the polymer main chain for NIR&#8208;II light phototriggered effective photothermal therapy and synergistic photoactivated chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.








Abstract
Selective activation of Pt(IV) prodrugs within tumors is particularly attractive because of their low damage to normal tissues. However, current common activation via chemical/photoreduction of Pt(IV) prodrugs into Pt(II) counterparts is limited by undesirable spatial&#8211;temporal control over this reduction process and the ineffective tissue penetration depth of undesirable light. Here, a pseudo&#8208;conjugated&#8208;polymer is designed via Stille polymerization, resulting in PSP&#8208;Pt with a Pt(IV) prodrug of oxaliplatin (Oxa(IV)) in the polymer main chain that can be activated by NIR&#8208;II light. PSP&#8208;Pt can co&#8208;assemble with a commercially available lipid polymer, namely mPEG2k&#8208;DSPE, into NPPSP&#8208;Pt. Under 1064&#160;nm light irradiation, NPPSP&#8208;Pt can be photoactivated to accelerate the Pt(IV) reduction to release oxaliplatin, thereby killing the cancer cells by photothermal effect and chemo&#8208;immunotherapy inside a mouse model with CT26 colon cancer. This work reports the application of NIR&#8208;II light for accelerating Pt(IV) reduction for cancer tumor therapy.

         <title>Giant Spin&#8208;Valve Effect in Planar Spin Devices Using an Artificially Implemented Nanolength Mott&#8208;Insulator Region</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extremely large magnetoresistance ratio is demonstrated in oxide&#8208;based lateral spin&#8208;valve devices, where a nonmagnetic nanochannel is made by implementing the metal&#8211;insulator transition in a nanoscale region of a La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 thin layer with Ar ion irradiation. The current is successfully modulated by applying the gate voltage. These are promising results for realizing oxide&#8208;based spin transistors.








Abstract
Developing technology to realize oxide&#8208;based nanoscale planar integrated circuits is in high demand for next&#8208;generation multifunctional electronics. Oxide circuits can have a variety of unique functions, including ferromagnetism, ferroelectricity, multiferroicity, superconductivity, and mechanical flexibility. In particular, for spin&#8208;transistor applications, the wide tunability of the physical properties due to the presence of multiple oxide phases is valuable for precise conductivity matching between the channel and ferromagnetic electrodes. This feature is essential for realistic spin&#8208;transistor operations. Here, a substantially large magnetoresistance (MR) ratio of up to &#8776;140% is demonstrated for planar&#8208;type (La,Sr)MnO3 (LSMO)&#8208;based spin&#8208;valve devices. This MR ratio is 10&#8211;100 times larger than the best values obtained for semiconductor&#8208;based planar devices, which have been studied over the past three decades. This structure is prepared by implementing an artificial nanolength Mott&#8208;insulator barrier region using the phase transition of metallic LSMO. The barrier height of the Mott&#8208;insulator region is only 55 meV, which enables the large MR ratio. Furthermore, a successful current modulation, which is a fundamental functionality for spin transistors, is shown. These results open up a new avenue for realizing oxide planar circuits with unique functionalities that conventional semiconductors cannot achieve.

         <title>Halides&#8208;Enhanced Buried Interfaces for Stable and Extremely Low&#8208;Voltage&#8208;Deficit Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, facile, and versatile strategy of pre&#8208;grafted halides is developed for strengthening the SnO2&#8211;perovskite buried interface, in which precise manipulation of perovskite defects and carrier dynamics has been realized by altering halide electronegativity (&#967;).








Abstract
The perovskite buried interfaces have demonstrated pivotal roles in determining both the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs);&#160;however, challenges remain in understanding and managing the interfaces due to their non&#8208;exposed feature. Here, we proposed a versatile strategy of pre&#8208;grafted halides to strengthen the SnO2&#8211;perovskite buried interface by precisely manipulating perovskite defects and carrier dynamics through alteration of halide electronegativity (&#967;), thereby resulting in both favorable perovskite crystallization and minimized interfacial carrier losses. Specifically, the implementation of fluoride with the highest &#967; induces the strongest binding affinity to uncoordinated SnO2&#160;defects and perovskite cations, leading to retarded perovskite crystallization and high&#8208;quality perovskite films with reduced residual stress. These improved properties enable champion efficiencies of 24.2% (the control: 20.5%) and 22.1% (the control: 18.7%) in rigid and flexible devices with extremely low voltage deficit down to 386&#160;mV, all of which are among the highest reported values for PSCs with a similar device architecture. In addition, the resulting devices exhibit marked improvements in the device longevity under various stressors of humidity (&gt;5000&#160;h), light (1000&#160;h), heat (180&#160;h), and bending test (10&#160;000&#160;times). This method provides an effective way to improve the quality of buried interfaces toward high&#8208;performance PSCs.

         <title>A 0D Additive&#160;for Flexible All&#8208;Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells to Go Beyond 60&#160;000 Flexible Cycles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;mechanical&#8208;durability flexible all&#8208;inorganic perovskite solar cell (PSCs) constructed by way of a 0D/3D mixed&#8208;dimensional structure is designed. The 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 additive effectively prevents the expansion of cracks during the bending process and enhances the efficiency of the all&#8208;inorganic flexible PSCs. This study provides a new route for further exploration of improving the mechanical durability of flexible all&#8208;inorganic PSCs.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic cesium lead halide flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs) exhibit superior thermal stability compared to their organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid counterparts. However, their flexibility and efficiency are still below&#8208;par for practical viability. Herein, a design using a 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 additive to transform tensile stress into compressive stress in the perovskite film, effectively preventing expansion of cracks for significantly improved mechanical durability, is reported. It is found that not only is improved flexibility obtained, but also the cell efficiency is increased for the all&#8208;inorganic flexible 3D CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx solar cells. The CsPbI2.81Br0.19 f&#8208;PSC retains over 97% of its initial efficiency even after 60&#160;000 flexing cycles at a curvature radius of 5&#160;mm (R = 5&#160;mm). Simultaneously, 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 enhances the crystallinity of the CsPbI2.81Br0.19 film and passivates the defects along the grain boundaries, effectively improving the photovoltaic performance of the all&#8208;inorganic f&#8208;PSCs. The highest power&#8208;conversion efficiency obtained is 14.25% with a short&#8208;circuit current density of 18.47&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.09&#160;V, and fill factor of 70.67%. This strategy paves the way for further improvement of the mechanical durability of all&#8208;inorganic f&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>An Overstretch Strategy to Double the Designed Elastic Stretchability of Stretchable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overstretch strategy is proposed, which is applied beyond the designed elastic range of stretchable structures after transfer printing and bonding to the soft substrate. The underlying mechanism is that the elastic range of the critical part of the stretchable structure is doubled, owing to the evolution of the elastoplastic constitutive relation during overstretching.








Abstract
Achieving or enhancing the elastic stretchability of inorganic stretchable electronics is critically significant. However, only two types of fundamental strategies&#8212;using the prestrained elastic substrate and designing the geometric layouts&#8212;are exploited thus far. This study proposes a third strategy, an overstretch strategy, applied beyond the designed elastic range of stretchable structures after transfer printing and bonding to a soft substrate. The theoretical, numerical, and experimental results collectively prove that the overstretch strategy can double the designed elastic stretchability of fabricated stretchable electronics and is valid for various geometrical interconnects with both thick and thin cross&#8208;sections. The underlying mechanism is that the elastic range of the critical part of the stretchable structure is doubled, owing to the evolution of the elastoplastic constitutive relation during overstretching. The overstretch strategy can be easily executed and combined with the other two strategies to enhance elastic stretchability, which has profound implications for the design, fabrication, and applications of inorganic stretchable electronics.

         <title>Precise Control of Single&#8208;Crystal Perovskite Nanolasers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exceptional points (EPs) are employed&#160;&#160;in precisely tuning &#160; perovskite lasing actions. By placing a nanoparticle to the boundary of a nanocavity, EPs periodically emerge as a function of the nanoparticle position: both the internal lasing actions and far&#8208;field radiation are completely reversed with a &lt;100 nm displacement. This research may find use in ultrasensitive position sensing.








Abstract
Efficient control of integrated light sources is crucial to advancing practical applications of nanophotonics. Despite the success of microlasers, their sophisticated nanostructures are not applicable in nanolasers. The situation for bottom&#8208;up&#8208;synthesized nanolasers becomes more challenging due to the constraints of fixed cavity shapes and fragile material stability. Here, the physics of exceptional points (EPs) is employed, and a strategy is demonstrated to precisely tune the lasing actions in lead halide perovskite nanorods. By placing a nanoparticle to the boundary of a square nanocavity, it is shown that EPs regularly and controllably emerge as a function of the nanoparticle position. Consequently, both the internal lasing actions and their far&#8208;field radiation can be completely reversed with a tiny displacement of &lt;100&#160;nm. The new strategy for controlling lasing actions in nanocavities is confirmed with numerical simulations and lasing experiments. This research can also bring new avenues for ultrasensitive position sensing.

         <title>A Molecular&#8208;Scale Understanding of Misorientation Toughening in Corals and Seashells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coral skeletons and nacre (left and right, respectively) have distinct structures, but they share slight misorientation of adjacent crystals, as displayed in these maps where color represents crystal orientation, and as measured in the histogram (center bottom). Synthetic spherulites, center top, spontaneously self&#8208;assemble with slight misorientation of adjacent crystals.








Abstract
Biominerals are organic&#8211;mineral composites formed by living organisms. They are the hardest and toughest tissues in those organisms, are often polycrystalline, and their mesostructure (which includes nano&#8208; and microscale crystallite size, shape, arrangement, and orientation) can vary dramatically. Marine biominerals may be aragonite, vaterite, or calcite, all calcium carbonate (CaCO3) polymorphs, differing in crystal structure. Unexpectedly, diverse CaCO3 biominerals such as coral skeletons and nacre share a similar characteristic: Adjacent crystals are slightly misoriented. This observation is documented quantitatively at the micro&#8208; and nanoscales, using polarization&#8208;dependent imaging contrast mapping (PIC mapping), and the slight misorientations are consistently between 1&#176; and 40&#176;. Nanoindentation shows that both polycrystalline biominerals and abiotic synthetic spherulites are tougher than single&#8208;crystalline geologic aragonite. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of bicrystals at the molecular scale reveal that aragonite, vaterite, and calcite exhibit toughness maxima when the bicrystals are misoriented by 10&#176;, 20&#176;, and 30&#176;, respectively, demonstrating that slight misorientation alone can increase fracture toughness. Slight&#8208;misorientation&#8208;toughening can be harnessed for synthesis of bioinspired materials that only require one material, are not limited to specific top&#8208;down architecture, and are easily achieved by self&#8208;assembly of organic molecules (e.g., aspirin, chocolate), polymers, metals, and ceramics well beyond biominerals.

A novel Cu/HfOx/solution&#8208;processable black phosphorus/Pt structure is designed and fabricated on a flexible Si substrate for neuromorphic computing and artificial visual perception. The device shows advanced synaptic features like long&#8208;term memory, short term memory, short&#8208;term potentiation, and learning&#8211;forgetting&#8211;relearning when illuminated by visible light. A 6 &#215; 6 optoelectronic synapse array is constructed and used to mimic the human visual perception and visual memory functions.








Abstract
Being renowned for operating with visible&#8208;light pulses and electrical signals, optoelectronic memristive synaptic devices have excellent potential for neuromorphic computing systems and artificial visual information processing. Here, a flexible back&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line&#8208;compatible optoelectronic memristor based on a solution&#8208;processable black phosphorus/HfOx bilayer with excellent synaptic features, toward biomimetic retinas is presented. The device shows highly stable synaptic features such as long&#8208;term potentiation (LTP) and long&#8208;term depression (LTD) for repetitive 1000 epochs, having 400 conductance pulses, each. The device presents advanced synaptic features in terms of long&#8208;term memory (LTM)/short term memory (STM), as well as learning&#8211;forgetting&#8211;relearning when visible light is induced on it. These advanced synaptic features can improve the information processing abilities for neuromorphic applications. Interestingly, the STM can be converted into LTM by adjusting the intensity of light and illumination time. Using the light&#8208;induced characteristics of the device, a 6&#160;&#215;&#160;6 synaptic array is developed to exhibit possible use in artificial visual perception. Moreover, the devices are flexed using a silicon back&#8208;etching process. The resulting flexible devices demonstrate stable synaptic features when bent down to 1&#160;cm radius. These multifunctional features in a single memristive cell make it highly suitable for optoelectronic memory storage, neuromorphic computing, and artificial visual perception applications.

         <title>Antisense Oligonucleotides Selectively Enter Human&#8208;Derived Antibiotic&#8208;Resistant Bacteria through Bacterial&#8208;Specific ATP&#8208;Binding Cassette Sugar Transporter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the challenge that the current vehicles used to deliver antisense oligonucleotides cannot distinguish between bacterial and mammalian cells, bacteria&#8208;specific ATP&#8208;binding cassette sugar transporters are leveraged to selectively internalize antisense oligonucleotides by hitchhiking them on &#945; (1&#8211;4)&#8208;glucosidically linked glucose polymers, allowing specific and efficient destruction of nearly 100% of the antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria.









Abstract
Current vehicles used to deliver antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) cannot distinguish between bacterial and mammalian cells, greatly hindering the preclinical or clinical treatment of bacterial infections, especially those caused by antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria. Herein, bacteria&#8208;specific ATP&#8208;binding cassette (ABC) sugar transporters are leveraged to selectively internalize ASOs by hitchhiking them on &#945; (1&#8211;4)&#8208;glucosidically linked glucose polymers. Compared with their cell&#8208;penetrating peptide counterparts, which are non&#8208;specifically engulfed by mammalian and bacterial cells, the presented therapeutics consisting of glucose polymer and antisense peptide nucleic&#8208;acid&#8208;modified nanoparticles are selectively internalized into the human&#8208;derived multidrug&#8208;resistant Escherichia coli and methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and they display a much higher uptake rate (i.e., 51.6%). The developed strategy allows specific and efficient killing of nearly 100% of the antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria. Its significant curative efficacy against bacterial keratitis and endophthalmitis is also shown. This strategy will expand the focus of antisense technology to include bacterial cells other than mammalian cells.

         <title>Versatile Host Materials for Both D&#8211;A&#8208;Type and Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emitters toward Solution&#8208;Processed OLEDs with Nearly 30% EQE</title>

A feasible molecular&#8208;design strategy of versatile hosts, featuring a twisted 3D&#160;structure, for both donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type and multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters is proposed, which enables highly efficient solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with external quantum efficiencies nearly 30%.








Abstract
Fabricating solution&#8208;processible host material for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitter remains a formidable challenge for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this work, two new host materials, namely 3CzAcPy and 9CzAcPy, are found to exhibit high triplet energy levels, high thermal stability, and excellent film morphology from a solution process. An in&#8208;depth analysis on the photophysical data and device performance reveals the isomeric effect of the host materials has a significant impact not only on the host properties, but also on the host&#8211;dopant interactions and thus the performance of the resulting solution&#8208;processed TADF OLEDs. Impressively, the new hosts are proven to be suitable for both donor&#8211;acceptor type and multi&#8208;resonance TADF emitters, achieving state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device performance. By using the new host 9CzAcPy, solution&#8208;processed OLED based on a donor&#8211;acceptor TADF emitter of DPAC&#8208;PCN, a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 29.5% is achieved, and solution&#8208;processed narrowband OLED based on a multiple&#8208;resonance TADF emitter of BN&#8208;CP1 acquires a maximum EQE of 26.6%. These efficiencies represent the highest values among the solution&#8208;processed TADF OLEDs. This study highlights the significance of host&#8211;dopant interactions in modulating the electroluminescence performance of TADF emitters, and provides an effective design principle for solution&#8208;processible host materials.

         <title>Photofunctional Scope of Fluorescent Dithienylethene Conjugates with Aza&#8208;Heteroaromatic Cations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dithienylethenes are structurally integrated with heteroaromatic cations. The photoswitches in their ring&#8208;open forms show fluorescence in the visible spectral range, while the ring&#8208;closed isomers are non&#8208;fluorescent. This leads to ON&#8211;OFF fluorescence switching with the emission output being fine&#8208;tuned by the conjugation degree of the heteroaromatic units.








Abstract
A series of dithienylethene (DTE) photoswitches with aza&#8208;heteroaromatic cationic moieties is synthesized. The switches are characterized regarding their photochemical and photophysical properties in acetonitrile and in water. The efficiency of the switching and the photostationary state composition depend on the degree of &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the heteroaromatic systems. Thus, DTEs with acridinium&#8208;derived moieties have very low quantum yields for the ring&#8208;closing process, which is in contrast to switches with pyridinium and quinolinium moieties. All switches emit fluorescence in their open forms. The involved electronic transitions are traced back to an integrative picture including the DTE core and the cationic arms. The emission can be fine&#8208;tuned by the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the heteroaromatic cations, reaching the red spectral region for DTEs with acridinium moieties. On ring&#8208;closing of the DTEs the fluorescence is not observable anymore. Theoretical calculations point to rather low&#8208;lying energy levels of the highly conjugated ring&#8208;closed DTEs, which would originate near&#8208;infrared emission (&gt; 1200&#160;nm). The latter is predicted to be very weak due to the concurrent non&#8208;radiative deactivation, according to the energy&#8208;gap law. In essence, an ON&#8211;OFF fluorescence switching as the result of the electrocyclic ring&#8208;closing reaction is observed.

         <title>Polarization&#8208;Tuned Fano Resonances in All&#8208;Dielectric Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Si/Ge0.90Sn0.10 core/shell metasurface is developed to harness Fano resonance in the short&#8208;wave infrared spectral range. This resonance exploits the efficient coupling between the electric and magnetic dipoles, which is modulated with the incident light polarization. A refractive&#8208;index nanosensor is fabricated to detect a change of 10&#8722;2 unit with a sensitivity of 386 nm/RIU, despite the low quality factor.








Abstract
The short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) is an underexploited portion of the electromagnetic spectrum in metasurface&#8208;based nanophotonics despite its strategic importance in sensing and imaging applications. This is mainly attributed to the lack of material systems to tailor light&#8211;matter interactions in this range. Herein, this limitation is addressed and an all&#8208;dielectric silicon&#8208;integrated metasurface enabling polarization&#8208;induced Fano resonance control at SWIR frequencies is demonstrated. The platform consists of a 2D Si/Ge0.9Sn0.1 core/shell nanowire array on a silicon wafer. By tuning the light polarization, it is shown that the metasurface reflectance can be efficiently engineered due to Fano resonances emerging from the electric and magnetic dipoles competition. The interference of optically induced dipoles in high&#8208;index nanowire arrays offers additional degrees of freedom to tailor the directional scattering and the flow of light while enabling sharp polarization&#8208;modulated resonances. This tunablity is harnessed in nanosensors yielding an efficient detection of 10&#8722;2 changes in the refractive index of the surrounding medium.

&lt;p&gt;A Si/Ge&lt;sub&gt;0.90&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.10&lt;/sub&gt; core/shell metasurface is developed to harness Fano resonance in the short-wave infrared spectral range. This resonance exploits the efficient coupling between the electric and magnetic dipoles, which is modulated with the incident light polarization. A refractive-index nanosensor is fabricated to detect a change of 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; unit with a sensitivity of 386 nm/RIU, despite the low quality factor.

         <title>A Universal Microscopic Patterned Doping Method for Perovskite Enables Ultrafast, Self&#8208;Powered, Ultrasmall Perovskite Photodiodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microscale patterned doping is difficult for perovskite&#160;due to its solubility to the photoresist. This problem is solved by utilizing the self&#8208;doping phenomenon of perovskite. This method is successfully realized by an ultrasmall (2 &#181;m) perovskite pn junction with satisfactory photodetector performance, which sheds light on fabricating integrated perovskite device arrays.








Abstract
Novel metal halide perovskite&#160;is proven to be a promising optoelectronic material. However, fabricating microscopic perovskite devices is still challenging because the perovskite is soluble with the photoresist, which conflicts with conventional microfabrication technology. The size of presently reported perovskite devices is about 50&#160;&#181;m. Limited by the large size of perovskite optoelectronic devices, they cannot be readily adopted in the fields of imaging, display, etc. Herein a universal microscopic patterned doping method is proposed, which can realize microscale perovskite devices. Rather than by the conventional doping method, in this study the local Fermi level of perovskite is modulated by the redistributing intrinsic ion defects via a polling voltage. A satisfactorily stable polarized ion distribution can be achieved by optimization of the perovskite material and polling voltage, resulting in ultrafast (40 &#181;s), self&#8208;powered microscale (2&#160;&#181;m) photodiodes. This work sheds light on a route to fabricate integrated perovskite optoelectronic chips.

         <title>Li&#8208;Ion Transfer Mechanism of Gel Polymer Electrolyte with Sole Fluoroethylene Carbonate Solvent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gel polymer electrolyte is in situ solidified with fluoroethylene carbonate and ester monomers to investigate the Li&#8208;ion transfer mechanism. Therein, an electron&#8208;delocalization interface layer between the solvent and the polymer matrix is formed. With lower ion&#8208;diffusion barrier, the electron&#8208;rich &#8220;Milky Way&#8221; is expected as a novel ion&#8208;transfer path, facilitating Li&#8208;ion migration.








Abstract
Although gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) represent a promising candidate to address the individual limitations of liquid and solid electrolytes, their extensive development is still hindered due to the veiled Li&#8208;ion conduction mechanism. Herein, the related mechanism in GPEs is extensively studied by developing an in situ polymerized GPE comprising fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) solvent and carbonate ester segments (F&#8208;GPE). Practically, although with high dielectric constant, FEC fails to effectively transport Li ions when acting as the sole solvent. By sharp contrast, F&#8208;GPE demonstrates superior electrochemical performances, and the related Li&#8208;ion transfer mechanism is investigated using molecular dynamics simulations and 7Li/6Li solid&#8208;state nNMR spectroscopy. The polymer segments are extended with the swelling of FEC, then an electron&#8208;delocalization interface layer is generated between abundant electron&#8208;rich groups of FEC and the polymer ingredients, which works as an electron&#8208;rich &#8220;Milky Way&#8221; and facilitates the rapid transfer of Li ions by lowering the diffusion barrier dramatically, resulting in a high conductivity of 2.47&#160;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;4&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 and a small polarization of about 20&#160;mV for Li//Li symmetric cell after 8000&#160;h. Remarkably, FEC provides high flame&#8208;retardancy and makes F&#8208;GPE remains stable under ignition and puncture tests.

         <title>A Highly Robust Amphibious Soft Robot with Imperceptibility Based on a Water&#8208;Stable and Self&#8208;Healing Ionic Conductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By precisely engineering the molecular structure and introducing cooperative ion&#8211;dipole interaction, a soft, self&#8208;healable, all&#8208;environment stable ionic conductor is developed. With this electrode material, a 50&#8208;time DEA lifetime and excellent underwater stability are achieved. Based on the synthesized electrode, the first highly robust, amphibious DEA&#8208;driven soft robot with imperceptibility is demonstrated.








Abstract
Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are widely exploited for actuating soft machines and granting soft robots with capability to operate in both underwater and on&#8208;land environments is important to make them adapt to more complex situations. Here, a DEA&#8208;driven, highly robust, amphibious imperceptible soft robot (AISR) based on an all&#8208;environment stable ionic conductive material is presented. A soft, self&#8208;healable, all&#8208;environment stable ionic conductor is developed by introducing cooperative ion&#8211;dipole interactions to provide underwater stability as well as efficient suppression of ion penetration. By tuning molecular structures of the material, a 50&#8208;time device lifetime increase compared with unmodified [EMI][TFSI]&#8208;based devices and excellent underwater actuating performance is achieved. With the synthesized ionic electrode, the DEA&#8208;driven soft robot exhibits amphibious functionality to traverse hydro&#8208;terrestrial regions. When encountering damage, the robot shows good resilience and can self&#8208;heal underwater and it also exhibits imperceptibility to light, sound, and heat.

         <title>(111)&#8208;Dominated Perovskite Films by Antisolvent Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antisolvent engineering is proposed to realize high&#8208;quality dominantly oriented perovskite film by the antisolvent of isopropyl alcohol (IPA). The interaction between IPA and PbI2 leads to the direct crystallization of (111)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 at room temperature, sidestepping the intermediates of PbI2&#8226;DMSO, FA2Pb3I8&#8226;4DMSO, and &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3. Solar cells based on (111)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 demonstrate improved performance compared to the randomly oriented perovskite films treated by other antisolvents.








Abstract
Fabricating perovskite films with a dominant crystal orientation is an effective path to realizing quasi&#8208;single&#8208;crystal perovskite film, which can eliminate the fluctuation of the electrical properties in films arising from grain&#8208;to&#8208;grain variations, and improve the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Perovskite (FAPbI3) films based on one&#8208;step antisolvent methods usually suffer from chaotic orientations due to the inevitable intermediate phase conversion from intermediates of PbI2&#8226;DMSO, FA2Pb3I8&#8226;4DMSO, and &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 to &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. Here, a high&#8208;quality perovskite film with (111) preferred orientation ((111)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) using a short&#8208;chain isomeric alcohol antisolvent, isopropanol (IPA) or isobutanol (IBA), is reported. The interaction between IPA and PbI2 leads to a corner&#8208;sharing structure instead of an edge&#8208;sharing PbI2 octahedron, sidestepping the formation of these intermediates. With the volatilization of IPA, FA+ can replace IPA in situ to form &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 along the (111) direction. Compared to randomly orientated perovskites, the dominantly (111) orientated perovskite ((111)&#8208;perovskite) exhibits improved carrier mobility, uniform surface potential, suppressed film defects and enhanced photostability. PSCs based on the (111)&#8208;perovskite films show 22% power conversion efficiency and excellent stability, which remains unchanged after 600&#160;h continuous working at maximum power point, and 95% after 2000&#160;h of storage in atmosphere environment.

Solar cells based on (111)-&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; demonstrate improved performance compared to the randomly oriented perovskite films treated by other antisolvents.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fabricating perovskite films with a dominant crystal orientation is an effective path to realizing quasi-single-crystal perovskite film, which can eliminate the fluctuation of the electrical properties in films arising from grain-to-grain variations, and improve the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Perovskite (FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) films based on one-step antisolvent methods usually suffer from chaotic orientations due to the inevitable intermediate phase conversion from intermediates of PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8226;DMSO, FA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&#8226;4DMSO, and &lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Here, a high-quality perovskite film with (111) preferred orientation ((111)-&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) using a short-chain isomeric alcohol antisolvent, isopropanol (IPA) or isobutanol (IBA), is reported. The interaction between IPA and PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; leads to a corner-sharing structure instead of an edge-sharing PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; octahedron, sidestepping the formation of these intermediates. With the volatilization of IPA, FA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; can replace IPA in situ to form &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; along the (111) direction. Compared to randomly orientated perovskites, the dominantly (111) orientated perovskite ((111)-perovskite) exhibits improved carrier mobility, uniform surface potential, suppressed film defects and enhanced photostability. PSCs based on the (111)-perovskite films show 22% power conversion efficiency and excellent stability, which remains unchanged after 600&#160;h continuous working at maximum power point, and 95% after 2000&#160;h of storage in atmosphere environment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pollen&#8208;Inspired Adhesive Multilobe Microparticles from Microfluidics for Intestinal Drug Delivery</title>

         <dc:description>
Peony&#8208;pollen&#8208;inspired multilobe microparticles are designed for target surface adhesion and durable drug release via microfluidic electrospray technology and hydrogel selective degradation. By loading dexamethasone inside, these microparticles show excellent adhesion ability and anti&#8208;inflammatory property in treating rats with inflammatory bowel disease.








Abstract
Microparticles (MPs)&#8208;based delivery systems have a demonstrated value in gastrointestinal administration. Research in this area is focusing on the development of multifunctional MPs to improve delivery effects. Herein, learning from the natural morphology of peony pollens, novel multilobe MPs delivery systems for target surface adhesion and durable drug release are pesented. Ascribing to the flexibility of microfluidic technology and the combination of selective hydrogel degradation methods, MPs with a series of multilobe structures can be obtained using alginate and methacrylated gelatin. Compared with spherical MPs, these multilobe MPs are elucidated to show excellent adhesion capacity due to their enhanced contact area. By encapsulating anti&#8208;inflammatory agent dexamethasone (DXM) into their matrix hydrogel, the resultant multilobe MPs delivery systems are verified to feature durable drug&#8208;release property and anti&#8208;inflammatory efficacy, which is further demonstrated in rats with inflammatory bowel disease. These results indicated that the biomimetic multilobe MPs are potentially ideal adhesive and durable drug&#8208;delivery vehicles for gastrointestinal drug administrations.

         <title>Metasurface&#8208;Enhanced Mid&#8208;Infrared Spectrochemical Imaging of Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metasurface&#8208;enhanced mid&#8208;infrared spectral tissue imaging method is developed to advance quantitative functional biomolecule mapping in brain tissue sections. Probing nanoscale tissue volumes via metasurface&#8208;localized strong electromagnetic fields, this imaging modality isolates the molecular composition information from the bulk physical properties of the tissue sections. The approach increases the sensitivity and selectivity of molecular fingerprint retrieval enhancing the chemical image contrast and enabling detection of ultrathin tissue regions.









Abstract
Label&#8208;free and nondestructive mid&#8208;infrared vibrational hyperspectral imaging is an essential tissue analysis tool, providing spatially resolved biochemical information critical to understanding physiological and pathological processes. However, the chemically complex and spatially heterogeneous composition of tissue specimens and the inherently weak interaction of infrared light with biomolecules limit the analytical performance of infrared absorption spectroscopy. Here, an advanced mid&#8208;infrared spectrochemical tissue imaging modality is introduced using metasurfaces that support strong surface&#8208;localized electromagnetic fields to capture quantitative molecular maps of large&#8208;area murine brain tissue sections. The approach leverages polarization&#8208;multiplexed multi&#8208;resonance plasmonic metasurfaces to simultaneously detect various functional biomolecules. The surface&#8208;enhanced mid&#8208;infrared spectral imaging method eliminates the non&#8208;specific effects of bulk tissue morphology on quantitative spectral analysis and improves chemical selectivity. This study shows that metasurface enhancement increases the retrieval of amide I and II bands associated with protein secondary structures. Moreover, it is demonstrated that plasmonic metasurfaces enhance the chemical contrast in infrared images and enable detection of ultrathin tissue regions that are not otherwise visible to conventional mid&#8208;infrared spectral imaging. While this work uses murine brain tissue sections, the&#160;chemical imaging method is well&#8208;suited for other tissue types, which broadens its potential impact for translational research and clinical histopathology.

         <title>Reversing Acute Kidney Injury through Coordinated Interplay of Anti&#8208;Inflammation and Iron Supplementation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasmall nicotinamide&#8208;mononucleotide&#8208;modified Fe3O4 (Fe3O4@NMN) nanoprobe with renal targeting ability has been constructed for reversing AKI through instant release of NMN and slow degradation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The upregulation of the erythropoietin level as well as the iron level in bone marrow is demonstrated to promote the generation of red blood cells, which plays a key role in accelerating renal recovery.








Abstract
Acute kidney injury (AKI) induced by ischemia reperfusion is closely related to mitochondrial dysfunction. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) can enhance the mitochondrial function and restrain the following inflammation, but it is hardly delivered and lacks renal targeting ability. To address these problems, herein, an ultrasmall Fe3O4 nanoparticle is used as a carrier to deliver nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a precursor of NAD+. An outstanding sophistication of the current design is that once NMN is attached on the surface of Fe3O4 nanoparticles through its phosphate group, the remaining part is structurally highly similar to nicotinamide riboside, which provides an opportunity to deliver the NAD+ precursor into renal cells through nicotinamide riboside kinase 1 on the cell membrane. It is demonstrated that NMN&#8208;loaded Fe3O4 nanoparticles can effectively reverse AKI induced by ischemia reperfusion. In&#8208;depth studies indicate that a well&#8208;timed iron replenishment following anti&#8208;inflammation treatment plays a determined role in recovering AKI, which distinguishes the current study from previous strategies centering on anti&#8208;ROS (reactive oxygen species), anti&#8208;inflammation, or even iron elimination.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Enriched Hollow Porous Carbon Nanocages Enable Highly Efficient Chlorine Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow porous carbon (HPC) nanocages with a controlled oxygen electronic state around the designed carbon defects are fabricated through a hard template strategy for the electrocatalytic chlorine evolution reaction (CER). The electron density around the unsaturated O atoms can be decreased on the minor defects in carbon which is favorable for the adsorption of Cl&#8722;. The optimum HPC nanocages with lowest defective degree show excellent electrocatalytic performance for the CER.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based catalysts are crucial for the electrocatalytic chlorine evolution reaction (CER) to reduce the usage of noble metals and industrial cost. However, the corresponding catalytic activity of high overpotential and low durability hinders their wide application. Here, a hollow porous carbon (HPC) nanocage with a controlled oxygen electronic state around designed carbon defects for CER activity is reported. Alkali etching can bring defects in zeolite with a hollow structure. In a hard template strategy, the type of carbon defects is directly related to etching degree of the zeolite template. More importantly, the oxygen atoms can be &#8220;borrowed&#8221; from the zeolite framework by the defective carbon. The electron density around unsaturated O atoms can be decreased on the minor defects in carbon compared with that on large defects which is favorable for the adsorption of Cl&#8722;. Consequently, the as&#8208;synthesized HPC nanocages with minor defects show excellent electrocatalytic performance for CER with a low overpotential of 94&#160;mV at current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with good stability, which is superior to the commercial precious metal catalyst of dimensionally stable anode (DSA), and the best in the reported carbon materials. The designed carbon materials provide an option for metal&#8208;free industrial catalysts with significant CER activities.

         <title>Universal Renaissance Strategy of Metal Fluoride in Secondary Ion Batteries Enabled by Liquid Metal Gallium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic limitations of metal fluorides can be solved by simply introducing GaF3. The in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated liquid Ga provides highly conformable ion/electron&#8208;transport networks, while doped Ga in the LiF crystal structure activates Li&#63743;F splitting. The lithium&#8208;ion storage capacity of MnF2 can be significantly increased by 87%, while the sodium&#8208;ion storage capacity of FeF3 can be increased by 33%.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state alkali ion batteries represent a future trend in battery technology, as well as provide an opportunity for low&#8208;cost metal fluoride electrode materials, if certain intrinsic problems can be resolved. In this work, a liquid metal activation strategy is proposed in which liquid Ga elements are generated in situ and doped into the LiF crystal structure by introducing a small amount of GaF3. Benefiting from these two Ga states of existence, in which the liquid metal Ga can continuously maintain conformable ion/electron&#8208;transport networks, while doped Ga in the LiF crystal structure catalyzes Li&#63743;F splitting, the lithium&#8208;ion storage capacity of MnF2 significantly increases&#160;by 87%. A similar effect can be obtained in FeF3, where the sodium&#8208;ion storage capacity is enhanced by 33%. This universal strategy with few restrictions can be used to realize a complete renaissance of metal fluorides, as well as offer an opportunity for the new application of liquid metals in the field of energy storage.

         <title>An Amphiphilic Entangled Network Design Toward Ultratough Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphiphilic hydrogels with ultrahigh toughness and durability are prepared by mixing a hydrophobic polymer into a hydrophilic matrix. Fine crystallites stiffen the network, which can endure long&#8208;term shear. Dense chain entanglements enable large tensile deformation with low hysteresis. The resulting gels can retain both hydrophilic and lipophilic molecules.








Abstract
Hydrogels find important roles in biomedicine, wearable electronics, and soft robotics, but their mechanical properties are often unsatisfactory. Conventional tough hydrogel designs are based on hydrophilic networks with sacrificial bonds, while the incorporation of hydrophobic polymers into hydrogels is less well understood. In this work, a hydrogel toughening strategy is demonstrated by introducing a hydrophobic polymer as reinforcement. Semicrystalline hydrophobic polymer chains are &#8220;woven&#8221; into a hydrophilic network via entropy&#8208;driven miscibility. In&#8208;situ&#8208;formed sub&#8208;micrometer crystallites stiffen the network, while entanglements between hydrophobic polymer and hydrophilic network enable large deformation before failure. The hydrogels are stiff, tough, and durable at high swelling ratios of 6&#8211;10, and the mechanical properties are tunable. Moreover, they can effectively encapsulate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules.

         <title>Sequential Co&#8208;Passivation in InAs Colloidal Quantum Dot Solids Enables Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To improve the passivation of III&#8208;V InAs quantum dots, this work designs a sequential co&#8208;passivation ligand exchange strategy involving Z&#8208;type, InBr3, and X&#8208;type methylammonium acetate. The application of sequential co&#8208;passivation dots to near&#8208;infrared photodetectors produces photodetectors with an external quantum efficiency of 37%, which is 20% better than the current best.








Abstract
III&#8208;V colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are promising materials for optoelectronic applications, for they avoid heavy metals while achieving absorption spanning the visible to the infrared (IR). However, the covalent nature of III&#8208;V CQDs requires the development of new passivation strategies to fabricate conductive CQD solids for optoelectronics: this work shows herein that ligand exchanges, previously developed in II&#8208;VI and IV&#8208;VI quantum dots and employing a single ligand, do not fully passivate CQDs, and that this curtails device efficiency. Guided by density functional theory (DFT) simulations, this work develops a co&#8208;passivation strategy to fabricate indium arsenide CQD photodetectors, an approach that employs the combination of X&#8208;type methyl ammonium acetate (MaAc) and Z&#8208;type ligands InBr3. This approach maintains charge carrier mobility and improves passivation, seen in a 25% decrease in Stokes shift, a fourfold reduction in the rate of first&#8208;exciton absorption linewidth broadening over time&#8208;under&#8208;stress, and leads to a doubling in photoluminescence (PL) lifetime. The resulting devices show 37% external quantum efficiency (EQE) at 950&#160;nm, the highest value reported for InAs CQD photodetectors.

         <title>Achieving Tunable Organic Afterglow and UV&#8208;Irradiation&#8208;Responsive Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Pyridine&#8208;Substituted Triphenylamine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of polymer&#8208;based room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials with ultralong lifetime, tunable afterglow, and UV&#8208;irradiation response is developed by simply doping pyridine&#8208;substituted TPA derivatives into the poly(vinyl alcohol) PVA and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) polymer matrixes, respectively. Diversified encryption patterns are fabricated to demonstrate the potential applications of these doping PVA and PMMA systems in multilevel anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption technologies.








Abstract
Amorphous polymers with ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are highly promising for various applications. Particularly, polymer&#8208;based RTP materials with multiple functions such as color&#8208;tunability or stimulus&#8208;response are highly desirable for multilevel anti&#8208;counterfeiting but are rarely reported. Herein, a facile strategy is presented to achieve a series of polymer&#8208;based RTP materials with ultralong lifetime, multicolor afterglow, and reversible response to UV irradiation by simply embedding pyridine&#8208;substituted triphenylamine derivatives into the polymer matrix poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), respectively. Notably, the pyridine group with the capabilities of promoting intersystem crossing and forming hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions is essential for triggering ultralong RTP from the doping PVA system, among which the doping film TPA&#8208;2Py@PVA exhibits excellent RTP property with an ultralong lifetime of 798.4&#160;ms and a high quantum yield of 15.2%. By further co&#8208;doping with the commercially available fluorescent dye, multicolor afterglow is obtained via phosphorescence energy transfer. Meanwhile, the doped PMMA system exhibits reversible photoactivated ultralong RTP properties under continuous UV irradiation. Finally, potential applications of these doped PVA and PMMA systems with ultralong lifetime, multicolor afterglow, and photoactivated ultralong RTP in multidimensional anti&#8208;counterfeiting are demonstrated.

         <title>Exploring Electronic Characteristics of Acceptor&#8211;Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8208;Type Molecules by Single&#8208;Molecule Charge Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through single&#8208;molecule detection, it is found that an acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8211;D&#8211;A)&#8208;type molecule with 1,1&#8208;dicyano methylene&#8208;3&#8208;indanone acceptor units exhibits enhanced conductance compared with the control donor molecule. Furthermore, the charge transport of the D central part is directly detected, proving that the conductive orbitals contributed by the acceptor groups can penetrate the whole A&#8211;D&#8211;A molecule.








Abstract
The electronic characteristics of organic optoelectronic materials determine the performance of corresponding devices. Clarifying the relationship between molecular structure and electronic characteristics at the single&#8208;molecule level can help to achieve high performance for organic optoelectronic materials and devices, especially for organic photovoltaics. In this work, a typical acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8211;D&#8211;A)&#8208;type molecule is explored by combining theoretical and experimental studies to reveal the intrinsic electronic characteristics at the single&#8208;molecule level. Specifically, the A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8208;type molecule with 1,1&#8208;dicyano methylene&#8208;3&#8208;indanone (INCN) acceptor units exhibits an enhanced conductance in single&#8208;molecule junctions when compared with the control donor molecule, because the acceptor units of the A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8208;type molecule contribute additional transport channels. In addition, through opening the S&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O noncovalent conformational lock by protonation to expose the &#8722;S anchoring sites, the charge transport of the D central part is detected, proving that the conductive orbitals contributed by the INCN acceptor groups can penetrate the whole A&#8211;D&#8211;A molecule. These results provide important insights into the development of high&#8208;performance organic optoelectronic materials and devices toward practical applications.

&lt;p&gt;Through single-molecule detection, it is found that an acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8211;D&#8211;A)-type molecule with 1,1-dicyano methylene-3-indanone acceptor units exhibits enhanced conductance compared with the control donor molecule.

         <title>Constructing an Interfacial Gradient Heterostructure Enables Efficient CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells and Printed Minimodules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interfacial gradient heterostructure (denoted as BTA+&#8208;CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx) is constructed to simultaneously tune CsPbI3 perovskite defects and interfacial energy levels. This strategy can significantly suppress nonradiative recombination in perovskites and facilitate charge transfer in a device. An efficiency of 21.31% is achieved for CsPbI3 solar cells, and a record efficiency of 16.60% is demonstrated for printed inorganic CsPbI3 minimodules.








Abstract
Severe nonradiative recombination originating from interfacial defects together with the pervasive energy level mismatch at the interface remarkably limits the performance of CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs). These issues need to be addressed urgently for high&#8208;performance cells and their applications. Herein, an interfacial gradient heterostructure based on low&#8208;temperature post&#8208;treatment of quaternary bromide salts for efficient CsPbI3 PSCs with an impressive efficiency of 21.31% and an extraordinary fill factor of 0.854 is demonstrated. Further investigation reveals that Br&#8722; ions diffuse into the perovskite films to heal undercoordinated Pb2+ and inhibit Pb cluster formation, thus suppressing nonradiative recombination in CsPbI3. Meanwhile, a more compatible interfacial energy level alignment resulting from Br&#8722; gradient distribution and organic cations surface termination is also achieved, hence promoting charge separation and collection. Consequently, the printed small&#8208;size cell with an efficiency of 20.28% and 12 cm2 printed CsPbI3 minimodules with a record efficiency of 16.60% are also demonstrated. Moreover, the unencapsulated CsPbI3 films and devices exhibit superior stability.

         <title>Non&#8208;Toxic CuInS2/ZnS Colloidal Quantum Dots for Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of CuInS2/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) with a high photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) of 65% at 920 nm is reported. Notably, the synthesis employs a supplementary S precursor, hexamethyldisilathiane (HMDS), which gives rise to better size homogeneity and an improvement in PLQE. Implementation of the QDs in a light&#8208;emitting device gives an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.2%.








Abstract
Ternary CuInS2 quantum dots (QDs) with photoluminescence that is tunable from the visible to the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region are promising light&#8208;emitters for consumer electronics due to the absence of toxic elements such as Pb, Cd, or As. Despite the compelling performance of visible&#8208;light&#8208;emitting CuInS2 QDs, reports on NIR emission remain limited, with modest efficiencies at wavelengths beyond 900&#160;nm. In this work, the facile synthesis of NIR&#8208;emitting CuInS2/ZnS QDs is reported. A combination of two&#160;sulfur precursors w as used in the synthesis, comprising 1&#8208;dodecanethiol (DDT) and hexamethyldisilathiane (HMDS). The reactive HMDS facilitates faster nucleation and leads to a higher density of emissive Cu&#8208;deficiency sites. The resulting QDs exhibit high photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) of 65% at a long emission wavelength of 920&#160;nm. Using these QDs, NIR light&#8208;emitting diodes (LED) are fabricated, which attain an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.2%. This efficiency is comparable to the best reported PbS and InAs QD LEDs, and the emission wavelength exceeds that of lead iodide perovskites. This work thus marks one of the first reports of efficient NIR LEDs based on environmentally benign CuInS2 QDs and may open up promising new applications in consumer electronic products.

         <title>Over 18% Efficiency of All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with Long&#8208;Term Stability Enabled by Y6 as a Solid Additive</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small amount of Y6 (2 wt%) as a solid additive is introduced intoPM6:PY&#8208;DT blend. Y6 can remain inside the active layer and interact with PY&#8208;DT to form a well&#8208;mixed phase. Increased molecular packing, enlarged phase separation, and decreased trap density in the Y6&#8208;processed blend result in a high efficiency over 18% and excellent long&#8208;term stability with a T80 lifetime of 1180&#160;h.








Abstract
Morphology control greatly influences the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and long&#8208;term stability of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs); however, it remains challenging owing to their complex crystallization behavior. Herein, a small amount of Y6 (2 wt%) is introduced as a solid additive into a PM6:PY&#8208;DT blend. Y6 remained inside the active layer and interacted with PY&#8208;DT to form a well&#8208;mixed phase. Increased molecular packing, enlarged phase separation size, and decreased trap density are observed for the Y6&#8208;processed PM6:PY&#8208;DT blend. The corresponding devices showed simultaneously improved short&#8208;circuit current and fill factor, achieving a high PCE of over 18% and excellent long&#8208;term stability, with a T80 lifetime of 1180&#160;h and an extrapolated T70 lifetime of 9185&#160;h at maximum power point tracking (MPP) conditions under continuous one&#8208;sun illumination. This Y6&#8208;assisted strategy is successfully applied to other all&#8208;polymer blends, demonstrating its universality for all&#8208;PSCs. This work paves a new way for the fabrication of all&#8208;PSCs with high efficiency and superior long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>Fluoride&#8208;Catalyzed Siloxane Exchange as a Robust Dynamic Chemistry for High&#8208;Performance Vitrimers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluoride&#8208;catalyzed siloxane exchange is an exceptionally robust chemistry for scalable production of high&#8208;performance vitrimers through reactive extrusion of commodity polymers such as poly(methyl methacrylate), polyethylene, and polypropylene. The vitrimers show improved resistance to creep, heat, oxidation, and hydrolysis, while maintaining excellent processability. Furthermore, the siloxane exchange between different vitrimers during mechanical blending results in self&#8208;compatibilized blends without any compatibilizers.








Abstract
Sustainable development of new technologies requires materials having advanced physical and chemical properties while maintaining reprocessability and recyclability. Vitrimers are designed for this purpose; however, their dynamic covalent chemistries often have drawbacks or are limited to specialized polymers.

&lt;p&gt;Fluoride-catalyzed siloxane exchange is an exceptionally robust chemistry for scalable production of high-performance vitrimers through reactive extrusion of commodity polymers such as poly(methyl methacrylate), polyethylene, and polypropylene. The vitrimers show improved resistance to creep, heat, oxidation, and hydrolysis, while maintaining excellent processability. Furthermore, the siloxane exchange between different vitrimers during mechanical blending results in self-compatibilized blends without any compatibilizers.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sustainable development of new technologies requires materials having advanced physical and chemical properties while maintaining reprocessability and recyclability. Vitrimers are designed for this purpose; however, their dynamic covalent chemistries often have drawbacks or are limited to specialized polymers. Here, fluoride-catalyzed siloxane exchange is reported as an exceptionally robust chemistry for scalable production of high-performance vitrimers through industrial processing of commodity polymers such as poly(methyl methacrylate), polyethylene, and polypropylene. The vitrimers show improved resistance to creep, heat, oxidation, and hydrolysis, while maintaining excellent melt flow for processing and recycling.

         <title>Improving the Performance of Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Processed Organic Solar Cells via Introducing a Wide&#8208;Bandgap Dopant into the Upper Acceptor Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wide&#8208;bandgap polymer poly(9&#8208;vinylcarbazole) (PVK) is added to the acceptor layer of layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer organic solar cells (OSCs). Besides enhancing molecular stacking, PVK n&#8208;dopes the electron acceptor, increases the electron concentration, and improves charge transport, leading to elevated power conversion efficiency in OSCs, especially for the D18/L8&#8208;BO active layer which demonstrates device efficiency over 19% with PVK addition.








Abstract
The layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) solution&#8208;processed organic solar cells (OSCs) are conductive to achieve vertical phase separation, tunable donor&#8211;acceptor (D/A) interfaces, and favorable charge&#8208;transport pathways. In this work, a wide&#8208;bandgap component poly(9&#8208;vinylcarbazole) (PVK) is added to the upper electron acceptor layer to improve the performance of LbL&#8208;processed OSCs. Results show that the PVK component can adjust the film morphology, dope the electron acceptor, increase the electron concentration, and improve charge transport. Such n&#8208;type doping is verified by Seebeck coefficient measurement, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, and electron paramagnetic resonance characterization. In addition, the fluorescence intensity and exciton lifetime of the PVK&#8208;doped acceptor film are increased, thus being beneficial for exciton diffusion to the D/A interface. Therefore, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of LbL OSCs increases when 2.50 wt.% PVK is employed in the electron acceptor layer of commonly&#8208;used high&#8208;efficiency system and a maximum value of 19.05% can be achieved. The role of PVK played in the active layer is different from those of additives and ternary components reported previously, so the results provide an alternative way to enhance the device performance of LbL&#8208;processed OSCs.

         <title>Inorganic Perovskite Surface Reconfiguration for Stable Inverted Solar Cells with 20.38% Efficiency and Its Application in Tandem Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward method involves utilizing 2&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;bromobenzamide (ABA) to fabricate efficient inorganic perovskite solar cells (IPSCs) by reconfiguring the surface properties of CsPbI2.85Br0.15 film. A record&#8208;breaking efficiency of 20.38% for p&#8211;i&#8211;n single&#8208;junction IPSCs is obtained. Furthermore, an inorganic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell is successfully demonstrated, with an impressive efficiency of 25.31%.








Abstract
Inorganic perovskite solar cells (IPSCs) have garnered attention in tandem solar cells (TSCs) due to their suitable bandgap and impressive thermal stability. However, the efficiency of inverted IPSCs has been limited by the high trap density on the top surface of inorganic perovskite film. Herein, a method for fabricating efficient IPSCs by reconfiguring the surface properties of CsPbI2.85Br0.15 film with 2&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;bromobenzamide (ABA) is developed. This modification not only exhibits the synergistic coordination of carbonyl (C=O) and amino (NH2) groups with uncoordinated Pb2+, but also the Br fills halide vacancies and suppresses the formation of Pb0, effectively passivating the defective top surface. As a result, a champion efficiency of 20.38%, the highest efficiency reported for inverted IPSCs to date is achieved. Furthermore, the successful fabrication of a p&#8211;i&#8211;n type monolithic inorganic perovskite/silicon TSCs with an efficiency of 25.31% for the first time is demonstrated. Crucially, the unencapsulated ABA&#8208;treated IPSCs shows enhanced photostability, retaining 80.33% of its initial efficiency after 270&#160;h, and thermal stability (maintain 85.98% of its initial efficiency after 300&#160;h at 65&#160;&#176;C). The unencapsulated ABA&#8208;treated TSCs also retains 92.59% of its initial efficiency after 200&#160;h under continuous illumination in ambient air.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Bipolar Photoresponse with Amplified Photocurrents in an Electrolyte&#8208;Assisted Bipolar p&#8211;n Junction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bipolar&#8208;junction photoelectrode based on p&#8211;n junction gallium nitride nanowires with ruthenium oxides surface decoration is built. The device exhibits unambiguously boosted bipolar photoresponse by an enhancement of 775% and 3000% for positive and negative photocurrents, respectively. Finally, a dual&#8208;band optical communication system incorporated with such photoelectrode is constructed using only one photoelectrode to decode dual&#8208;channel signals with encrypted property.








Abstract
The p&#8211;n junction with bipolar characteristics sets the fundamental unit to build electronics while its unique rectification behavior constrains the degree of carrier tunability for expanded functionalities. Herein, a bipolar&#8208;junction photoelectrode employed with a gallium nitride (GaN) p&#8211;n homojunction nanowire array that operates in electrolyte is reported, demonstrating bipolar photoresponse controlled by different wavelengths of light. Significantly, with rational decoration of a ruthenium oxides (RuOx) layer on nanowires guided by theoretical modeling, the resulting RuOx/p&#8211;n GaN photoelectrode exhibits unambiguously boosted bipolar photoresponse by an enhancement of 775% and 3000% for positive and negative photocurrents, respectively, compared to the pristine nanowires. The loading of the RuOx layer on nanowire surface optimizes surface band bending, which facilitates charge transfer across the GaN/electrolyte interface, meanwhile promoting the efficiency of redox reaction for both hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction which corresponds to the negative and positive photocurrents, respectively. Finally, a dual&#8208;channel optical communication system incorporated with such photoelectrode is constructed with using only one photoelectrode to decode dual&#8208;band signals with encrypted property. The proposed bipolar device architecture presents a viable route to manipulate the carrier dynamics for the development of a plethora of multifunctional optoelectronic devices for future sensing, communication, and imaging systems.

         <title>Microfluidic Templated Stem Cell Spheroid Microneedles for&#160;Diabetic Wound Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel stem cell spheroid loaded microneedle patch fabricated with an advanced microfluidic template approach is presented. The microneedle platform enables the precise delivery and exchange of multiple active substances, which contribute to advanced neovascularization, collagen deposition, and tissue reconstruction of diabetic wounds.








Abstract
Wound dressing patches based on stem cells have demonstrated promising potential in the treatment of diabetic wounds, while their capabilities in the maintenance of cell stemness, effective exchange of cellular substance, and precise targeting of the stem cells remain to be promoted. Here, a novel stem cell spheroid loaded microneedle (MN@SPs) patch is presented using microfluidic templating technology. By leveraging the precise fluid manipulation capabilities of the microfluidic template, stem cell spheroids (SPs) with uniform size can be generated in situ. The resulting SPs exhibit advanced viability and cell functions, as evidenced by the overexpressed genes related to extracellular matrix organization and angiogenesis. By loading these SPs into the microneedles (MNs), the platform enables the precise delivery and exchange of multiple active substances, which contribute to advanced neovascularization, collagen deposition, and tissue reconstruction of diabetic wounds. Overall, this microfluidic&#8208;engineered stem cell therapy platform demonstrates significant promise in promoting wound healing.

By leveraging the precise fluid manipulation capabilities of the microfluidic template, stem cell spheroids (SPs) with uniform size can be generated in situ. The resulting SPs exhibit advanced viability and cell functions, as evidenced by the overexpressed genes related to extracellular matrix organization and angiogenesis. By loading these SPs into the microneedles (MNs), the platform enables the precise delivery and exchange of multiple active substances, which contribute to advanced neovascularization, collagen deposition, and tissue reconstruction of diabetic wounds. Overall, this microfluidic-engineered stem cell therapy platform demonstrates significant promise in promoting wound healing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rationalized Electroepitaxy toward Scalable Single&#8208;Crystal Zn Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scalable Zn electroepitaxy is realized on the mass&#8208;produced mono&#8208;oriented Cu(111) foil by reasonably circumventing interface distorted alloying and electroosmosis of the second kind, harvesting ultrahigh reversibility of Zn anodes.








Abstract
Electroepitaxy is recognized as an effective approach to prepare metal electrodes with nearly complete reversibility. Nevertheless, large&#8208;scale manipulation is still not attainable owing to complicated interfacial chemistry. Here, the feasibility of extending Zn electroepitaxy toward the bulk phase over a mass&#8208;produced mono&#8208;oriented Cu(111) foil is demonstrated. Interfacial Cu&#8211;Zn alloy and turbulent electroosmosis are circumvented by adopting a potentiostatic electrodeposition protocol. The as&#8208;prepared Zn single&#8208;crystalline anode enables stable cycling of symmetric cells at a stringent current density of 50.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The assembled full cell further sustaines a capacity retention of 95.7% at 5.0 A g&#8722;1 for 1500 cycles, accompanied by a controllably low N/P ratio of 7.5. In addition to Zn, Ni electroepitaxy can be realized by using the same approach. This study may inspire rational exploration of the design of high&#8208;end metal electrodes.

         <title>In Situ Device&#8208;Level TEM Characterization Based on Ultra&#8208;Flexible Multilayer MoS2 Micro&#8208;Cantilever</title>

An in&#160;situ opto&#8208;electromechanical transmission electron microscopy characterization platform is first developed by integrating with an ultra&#8208;flexible piezoresistive molybdenum disulfide&#160;micro&#8208;cantilever for device&#8208;level electromechanical and opto&#8208;electromechanical mechanism exploration.








Abstract
Current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in&#160;situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization technology has been capable of statically or dynamically nanorobotic manipulating specimens, affording abundant atom&#8208;level material attributes. However, an insurmountable barrier between material attributes investigations and device&#8208;level application explorations exists due to immature in&#160;situ TEM manufacturing technology and sufficient external coupled stimulus. These limitations seriously prevent the development of in&#160;situ device&#8208;level TEM characterization. Herein, a representative in&#160;situ opto&#8208;electromechanical TEM characterization platform is put forward by integrating an ultra&#8208;flexible micro&#8208;cantilever chip with optical, mechanical, and electrical coupling fields for the first time. On this platform, static and dynamic in&#160;situ device&#8208;level TEM characterizations are implemented by utilizing molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)&#160;nanoflake as channel material. E&#8208;beam modulation behavior in MoS2&#160;transistors is demonstrated at ultra&#8208;high e&#8208;beam acceleration voltage (300&#160;kV), stemming from inelastic scattering electron doping into MoS2&#160;nanoflakes. Moreover, in&#160;situ dynamic bending MoS2&#160;nanodevices without/with laser irradiation reveals asymmetric piezoresistive properties based on electromechanical effects and secondary enhanced photocurrent based on opto&#8208;electromechanical coupling effects, accompanied by real&#8208;time monitoring atom&#8208;level characterization. This approach provides a step toward advanced in&#160;situ device&#8208;level TEM characterization technology with excellent perception ability and inspires in&#160;situ TEM characterization with ultra&#8208;sensitive force feedback and light sensing.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Driven Solvation toward Low&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries with Temperature&#8208;Adaptive Feature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Salt precipitation is resolved via tuning the entropy of solvation in a strong&#8208;solvation (SS)&#8211;weak&#8208;solvation (WS) solvent mixture. As a result, the solvation structure can transform at low temperature by spontaneous increase in entropy of the electrolyte, with a feature of temperature&#8208;adaption. This ensures a fast de&#8208;ionization process and stable co&#8208;intercalation process at low temperature.









Abstract
Salt precipitation at temperatures far above the freezing point of solvents is primarily responsible for performance decay of rechargeable batteries at low temperature, yet is still challenged by a lack of in&#8208;depth understanding of the design principle and ultimate solutions. Here, this is resolved via tuning the entropy of solvation in a strong&#8208;solvation (SS) and weak&#8208;solvation (WS) solvent mixture, in which a solvation structure can spontaneously transform at low temperature to avoid salt precipitation, endowing the electrolyte with a temperature&#8208;adaptive feature. The results affirm that such temperature&#8208;adaptive electrolyte ensures encouraging low&#8208;temperature performance in a hard carbon||Na2/3Ni1/4Cu1/12Mn2/3O2 full cell with 90.6% capacity retention over 400 cycles at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. The generality of the concept is further expanded to construct a series of SS&#8211;WS electrolytes as potential candidates for rechargeable low&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The work shed lights on the importance of entropy tuning and affords a rational viewpoint on designing low&#8208;temperature electrolytes.

         <title>Ordering&#8208;Dependent Hydrogen Evolution and Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis of High&#8208;Entropy Intermetallic Pt4FeCoCuNi</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ordering transformation of high&#8208;entropy Pt4FeCoNiCu nanoparticles from disordered solid&#8208;solution alloy to ordered intermetallic structure is demonstrated across multiple scales. The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities are revealed to be ordering&#8208;dependent, and the highly ordered Pt4FeCoNiCu outperforms most other Pt&#8208;based catalysts for HER and ORR with robust durability.








Abstract
Disordered solid&#8208;solution high&#8208;entropy alloys have attracted wide research attention as robust electrocatalysts. In comparison, ordered high&#8208;entropy intermetallics have been hardly explored and the effects of the degree of chemical ordering on catalytic activity remain unknown. In this study, a series of multicomponent intermetallic Pt4FeCoCuNi nanoparticles with tunable ordering degrees is fabricated. The transformation mechanism of the multicomponent nanoparticles from disordered structure into ordered structure is revealed at the single&#8208;particle level, and it agrees with macroscopic analysis by selected&#8208;area electron diffraction and X&#8208;ray diffraction. The electrocatalytic performance of Pt4FeCoCuNi nanoparticles correlates well with their crystal structure and electronic structure. It is found that increasing the degree of ordering promotes electrocatalytic performance. The highly ordered Pt4FeCoCuNi achieves the highest mass activities toward both acidic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) which are 18.9&#8208;fold and 5.6&#8208;fold higher than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively. The experiment also shows that this catalyst demonstrates better long&#8208;term stability than both partially ordered and disordered Pt4FeCoCuNi as well as Pt/C when subject to both HER and ORR. This ordering&#8208;dependent structure&#8211;property relationship provides insight into the rational design of catalysts and stimulates the exploration of many other multicomponent intermetallic alloys.

         <title>Heteroatom&#8208;Driven Coordination Fields Altering Single Cerium Atom Sites for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through ubtle modulation of the coordination environments by introducing P and S heteroatoms, the Ce electroactive sites are modulated to achieve effective enhancement of the oxygen reduction reaction's intrinsic catalytic activity. This work supplies significant references for optimizing the electroactivity of atomic catalysts by a coordination regulation strategy.








Abstract
For current single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), modulating the coordination environments of rare&#8208;earth (RE) single atoms with complex electronic orbital and flexible chemical states is still limited. Herein, cerium (Ce) SAs supported on a P, S, and N co&#8208;doped hollow carbon substrate (Ce SAs/PSNC) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are reported. The as&#8208;prepared Ce SAs/PSNC possesses a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.90&#160;V, a turnover frequency value of 52.2&#160;s&#8722;1 at 0.85&#160;V, and excellent stability for the ORR, which exceeds the commercial Pt/C and most recent SACs. Ce SAs/PSNC&#8208;based liquid zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) exhibit a high and stable open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.49&#160;V and a maximum power density of 212&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2. As the catalyst of the air cathode, it also displays remarkable performance in flexible electronic devices. Theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of S and P sites induces significant electronic modulations to the Ce SA active sites. The P and S dopings promote the electroactivity of Ce SAs and improve the overall site&#8208;to&#8208;site electron transfer within the Ce SAs/PSNC. This work offers a unique perspective for modulating RE&#8208;based SACs in a complex coordination environment toward superior electrocatalysis and broad applications in energy conversion and storage devices.

Crystal Misorientation
In article number 2300373, Andrew J. Lew, Davide Ruffoni, Markus J. Buehler, Pupa U. P. A. Gilbert, and co&#8208;workers reveal that the toughness of polycrystalline seashells and coral skeletons is increased by small misorientation of adjacent crystals. The findings pave the way toward bioinspired materials with tunable toughness.

Polarization Order
Polarization&#8208;switching processes of fluorite&#8208;oxide thin films remain elusive due to the challenges of visualizing oxygen ions. In article number 2207736, Chen Ge, Qinghua Zhang, Lin Gu, and co&#8208;workers directly capture the transition between ferroelectric and antiferroelectric orders using integrated differential phase&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy.

Drug Delivery
In article number 2212210, Funan Liu, Hongjun Li, Zhen Gu, and co&#8208;workers present an oncolytic virus therapy that can target metastasis after systemic administration. Tumor cells that have been pre&#8208;infected with an oncolytic virus serve as the delivery vehicle after pathogenicity has been eliminated by liquid nitrogen shock, but their metastasis&#8208;targeting ability is maintained by the integrity of cellular structure and surface protein preservation. This Trojan&#8208;horse&#8208;like method prevents virus neutralization and clearance in the bloodstream and improves tumor&#8208;specific delivery.

Photoelectrodes
A bipolar&#8208;junction photoelectrode based on a p&#8211;n&#8208;junction GaN nanowire array is shown by Haiding Sun and co&#8208;workers in article number 2300911 to exhibit unambiguously bipolar photoresponse with an output of positive and negative photocurrents under illumination of 365 nm and 265 nm light, respectively. Importantly, a dual&#8208;band optical communication system incorporated with such a photoelectrode is constructed using only one photoelectrode to decode dual&#8208;channel signals with encrypted property.

TEM Cantilever Chips
In article number 2301439, Chaojian Hou, Jing Zhao, Lixin Dong, and co&#8208;workers report a cantilever chip for in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The chip consists of a MoS2 opto&#8208;electromechanical sensor and a plasmonic antenna array built on the top of a Si3N4 cantilever, forming an electron&#8208;beam&#8208;transparent (thickness &#8776;100 nm) nano&#8208;opto&#8208;electromechanical system (NOEMS), enabling the in situ calibration/characterization of the NOEMS sensor or another device, with the NOEMS serving as a sensor to correlate the physical properties and atomic structures.

Abstract
The emergence of plastic electronics satisfies the increasing demand for flexible electronics. However, it has caused severe ecological problems. Flexible electronics based on natural materials are increasing to hopefully realize the &#8220;green&#8221; and eco&#8208;friendly concept. Herein, recent advances in the design and fabrication of green flexible electronics are reviewed. First, this review comprehensively introduces various natural materials and derivatives, focusing particularly on fibroin and silk, wood and paper, plants, and biomass. Second, fabrication techniques for modifying natural materials, including physical and chemical methods, are presented, after which their merits and demerits are thoroughly discussed. Green flexible electronics based on natural materials, comprising electrical wires/electrodes, antennas, thermal management devices, transistors, memristors, sensors, energy&#8208;harvesting devices, energy&#8208;storage devices, displays, actuators, electromagnetic shielding, and integration systems, are described in detail. Finally, perspectives on the existing challenges and opportunities to employ natural materials in green flexible electronics are presented.

         <title>Defective Metal Oxides: Lessons from CO2RR and Applications in NOxRR</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boosting the intrinsic activity of active sites on oxide surfaces is a critical factor in promoting electrochemical conversion reactions. A special focus is placed on the structure&#8211;performance relationship of oxygen vacancies in carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR)/nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) electrocatalysts. This work examines the formation/characterization of defects for CO2RR, taking learnings, challenges, and future directions in designing defective oxides for the emerging field of NO3RR.








Abstract
Sluggish reaction kinetics and the undesired side reactions (hydrogen evolution reaction and self&#8208;reduction) are the main bottlenecks of electrochemical conversion reactions, such as the carbon dioxide and nitrate reduction reactions (CO2RR and NO3RR). To date, conventional strategies to overcome these challenges involve electronic structure modification and modulation&#160;of the&#160;charge&#8208;transfer behavior. Nonetheless, key aspects of surface modification, focused on boosting the intrinsic activity of active sites on the catalyst surface, are yet to be fully understood. Engingeering of oxygen vacancies (OVs) can tune surface/bulk electronic structure and improve surface active sites of electrocatalysts. The continuous breakthroughs and significant progress in the last decade position engineering of OVs as a potential technique for advancing electrocatalysis. Motivated by this, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art findings of the roles of OVs in both the CO2RR and the NO3RR are presented. The review starts with a description of approaches to constructing and techniques for characterizing OVs. This is followed by an overview of the mechanistic understanding of the CO2RR and a detailed discussion on the roles of OVs in the CO2RR. Then, insights into the NO3RR mechanism and the potential of OVs on NO3RR based on early findings are&#160;highlighted. Finally, the challenges in designing CO2RR/NO3RR electrocatalysts and perspectives in studying OV engineering are provided.

Inspired by a world entering a quantum age, a human&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;loop framework is presented, which addresses key challenges and opportunities to overcome in the manufacturing of quantum materials.








Abstract
The quantum age is just around the corner. As quantum systems become more stable, robust, and mainstream, tackling the challenge of high&#8208;throughput manufacturing will require further developments in materials synthesis, characterization, assembly, and diagnostics. As the building blocks of future technologies scale down to atomic and molecular scales, a paradigm shift in manufacturing will begin to take shape. Inspired by a quantum manufacturing world that elevates the Materials Genome Initiative to the next level, a &#8220;human&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;loop&#8221; framework for high&#8208;throughput manufacturing, which addresses key opportunities and challenges to be overcome, is outlined.

         <title>Topology and Symmetry in Quantum Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological materials offer conceptual novelties and provide unique platforms for exploring fundamental science questions and transformational next&#8208;generation technologies. This perspective presents a cross section&#160;through the recent work focused on understanding the role of geometry and topology in generating topological states and their responses to external stimuli, and as a basis for connecting theory and experiment within the band theory paradigm. The image highlights how constant energy surfaces in topological materials differ fundamentally from those in normal materials.








Abstract
Interest in topological materials continues to grow unabated in view of their conceptual novelties as well as their potential as platforms for transformational new technologies. Electronic states in a topological material are robust against perturbations and support unconventional electromagnetic responses. The first&#8208;principles band&#8208;theory paradigm has been a key player in the field by providing successful prediction of many new classes of topological materials. This perspective presents a cross section&#160;through the recent work on understanding the role of geometry and topology in generating topological states and their responses to external stimuli, and as a basis for connecting theory and experiment within the band theory framework. In this work, effective strategies for topological materials discovery and impactful directions for future topological materials research are also commented.

Quantum Sensing of Thermopower
Thermopower has been extensively studied in low&#8208;dimensional materials where quantum confinement and spin textures can largely modulate thermopower generation. In article number 2106871, Heejun Yang, Suyeon Cho, and co&#8208;workers introduce the quantum sensing of thermopower, including the unique role of low&#8208;dimensionality, defects, spins, and relativistic effects. Investigating the microscopic nature of thermopower in quantum materials can provide insights useful for the design of advanced materials for future thermoelectric applications.

Quantum Applications
In article number 2201064, Ajit K. Roy and co&#8208;workers present a perspective of quantum technology state of the art wherein critical stumbling blocks for quantum technology development are identified. As represented in the cover, atomic defects are created in a transition metal chalcogenide (TMD) thin film with a specialized tip in an atomic force microscope. AFM tip tracing indicates atomic&#8208;scale localization of materials states at the defect location. These controlled and localized defect sites are the source of quantum signal generation under a biased field.

         <title>Through the Lens of a Momentum Microscope: Viewing Light&#8208;Induced Quantum Phenomena in 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, time&#8208;resolved momentum&#8208;microscopy is highlighted as a powerful new technique for characterizing photoexcited two&#8208;dimensional materials in momentum&#8208;space. The recent scientific progress that is&#160;made thanks to this technique is surveyed. The future directions in which it will be impactful are outlined: the dynamics of photoexcitations, and the control of the band&#8208;structure by Floquet band engineering.








Abstract
Van der Waals (vdW) materials at their 2D limit are diverse, flexible, and unique laboratories to study fundamental quantum phenomena and their future applications. Their novel properties rely on their pronounced Coulomb interactions, variety of crystal symmetries and spin&#8208;physics, and the ease of incorporation of different vdW materials to form sophisticated heterostructures. In particular, the excited state properties of many 2D semiconductors and semi&#8208;metals are relevant for their technological applications, particularly those that can be induced by light. In this paper, the recent advances made in studying out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium, light&#8208;induced, phenomena in these materials are reviewed using powerful, surface&#8208;sensitive, time&#8208;resolved photoemission&#8208;based techniques, with a particular emphasis on the emerging multi&#8208;dimensional photoemission spectroscopy technique of time&#8208;resolved momentum microscopy. The advances this technique has enabled in studying the nature and dynamics of occupied excited states in these materials are discussed. Then, the future research directions opened by these scientific and instrumental advancements are projected for studying the physics of 2D materials and the opportunities to engineer their band&#8208;structure and band&#8208;topology by laser fields.

         <title>Magnetic Topological Insulator Heterostructures: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of topology and magnetic order can lead to new quantum states and exotic physical effects. An overview of proximity&#8208;coupled magnetic topological insulator heterostructures, involving modulation doping, magnetic insulators, antiferromagnets, and rare&#8208;earth dopants, is given. They form a platform for exploring emergent phenomena such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect, real&#8208;space topological spin textures, and interfacial exchange coupling.








Abstract
Topological insulators (TIs) provide intriguing prospects for the future of spintronics due to their large spin&#8211;orbit coupling and dissipationless, counter&#8208;propagating conduction channels in the surface state. The combination of topological properties and magnetic order can lead to new quantum states including the quantum anomalous Hall effect that was&#160;first experimentally realized in Cr&#8208;doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 films. Since magnetic doping can introduce detrimental effects, requiring very low operational temperatures, alternative approaches are explored. Proximity coupling to magnetically ordered systems is an obvious option, with the prospect to raise the temperature for observing the various quantum effects. Here, an overview of proximity coupling and interfacial effects in TI heterostructures is presented, which provides a versatile materials platform for tuning the magnetic and topological properties of these exciting materials. An introduction is first given to the heterostructure growth by molecular beam epitaxy and suitable structural, electronic, and magnetic characterization techniques. Going beyond transition&#8208;metal&#8208;doped and undoped TI heterostructures, examples of heterostructures are discussed, including rare&#8208;earth&#8208;doped TIs, magnetic insulators, and antiferromagnets, which lead to exotic phenomena such as skyrmions and exchange bias. Finally, an outlook on novel heterostructures such as intrinsic magnetic TIs and systems including 2D materials is&#160;given.

         <title>Quantum Sensing of Thermoelectric Power in Low&#8208;Dimensional Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermoelectric conversion has been extensively studied in low&#8208;dimensional materials where quantum confinement and spin textures can largely modulate thermopower generation. In this review, the thermoelectric microscopy&#8208;based quantum sensing of thermopower from classical, spin&#8208;polarized electron transport, collective spin dynamics, and relativistic effect is summarized. Investigating the microscopic nature of thermopower in quantum materials provide insights for the future thermoelectric applications.








Abstract
Thermoelectric power, has been extensively studied in low&#8208;dimensional materials where quantum confinement and spin textures can largely modulate thermopower generation. In addition to classical and macroscopic values, thermopower also varies locally over a wide range of length scales, and is fundamentally linked to electron wave functions and phonon propagation. Various experimental methods for the quantum sensing of localized thermopower have been suggested, particularly based on scanning probe microscopy. Here, critical advances in the quantum sensing of thermopower are introduced, from the atomic to the several&#8208;hundred&#8208;nanometer scales, including the unique role of low&#8208;dimensionality, defects, spins, and relativistic effects for optimized power generation. Investigating the microscopic nature of thermopower in quantum materials can provide insights useful for the design of advanced materials for future thermoelectric applications. Quantum sensing techniques for thermopower can pave the way to practical and novel energy devices for a sustainable society.

         <title>Understanding Heterogeneities in Quantum Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterogeneities such as defects, impurities, edges, interfaces, and disorder often define and affect the coherence, interaction, entanglement, and topology of quantum states. Their roles in quantum materials are examined at the atomistic level by revealing the different degrees of freedom of heterogeneities, understanding their effects on the host material, and controlling heterogeneities to create new materials with tailored quantum functions.








Abstract
Quantum materials are usually heterogeneous, with structural defects, impurities, surfaces, edges, interfaces, and disorder. These heterogeneities are sometimes viewed as liabilities within conventional systems; however, their electronic and magnetic structures often define and affect the quantum phenomena such as coherence, interaction, entanglement, and topological effects in the host system. Therefore, a critical need is to understand the roles of heterogeneities in order to endow materials with new quantum functions for energy and quantum information science applications. In this article, several representative examples are reviewed on the recent progress in connecting the heterogeneities to the quantum behaviors of real materials. Specifically, three intertwined topic areas are assessed: i) Reveal the structural, electronic, magnetic, vibrational, and optical degrees of freedom of heterogeneities. ii) Understand the effect of heterogeneities on the behaviors of quantum states in host material systems. iii) Control heterogeneities for new quantum functions. This progress is achieved by establishing the atomistic&#8208;level structure&#8208;property relationships associated with heterogeneities in quantum materials. The understanding of the interactions between electronic, magnetic, photonic, and vibrational states of heterogeneities enables the design of new quantum materials, including topological matter and quantum light emitters based on heterogenous 2D materials.

         <title>Strain Engineering of Low&#8208;Dimensional Materials for Emerging Quantum Phenomena and Functionalities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in strain&#8208;tunable quantum phenomena and functionalities, focusing on low&#8208;dimensional quantum materials. Experimental strategies for strain engineering are discussed in terms of heterogeneity and elastic reconfigurability of strain distribution. The nontrivial quantum properties of several strain&#8208;quantum coupled platforms, including 2D van der Waals materials and heterostructures, topological insulators, superconducting oxides, and metal halide perovskites, are outlined.








Abstract
Recent discoveries of exotic physical phenomena, such as unconventional superconductivity in magic&#8208;angle twisted bilayer graphene, dissipationless Dirac fermions in topological insulators, and quantum spin liquids, have triggered tremendous interest in quantum materials. The macroscopic revelation of quantum mechanical effects in quantum materials is associated with strong electron&#8211;electron correlations in the lattice, particularly where materials have reduced dimensionality. Owing to the strong correlations and confined geometry, altering atomic spacing and crystal symmetry via strain has emerged as an effective and versatile pathway for perturbing the subtle equilibrium of quantum states. This review highlights recent advances in strain&#8208;tunable quantum phenomena and functionalities, with particular focus on low&#8208;dimensional quantum materials. Experimental strategies for strain engineering are first discussed in terms of heterogeneity and elastic reconfigurability of strain distribution. The nontrivial quantum properties of several strain&#8208;quantum coupled platforms, including 2D van der Waals materials and heterostructures, topological insulators, superconducting oxides, and metal halide perovskites, are next outlined, with current challenges and future opportunities in quantum straintronics followed. Overall, strain engineering of quantum phenomena and functionalities is a rich field for fundamental research of many&#8208;body interactions and holds substantial promise for next&#8208;generation electronics capable of ultrafast, dissipationless, and secure information processing and communications.

         <title>Harnessing the Quantum Behavior of Spins on Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By incorporating electron spin resonance capability in spin&#8208;polarized scanning tunneling microscopy, quantum states of individual spins on surfaces can be initialized, controlled, and read out. Individual spins and artificial spin structures built atom&#8208;by&#8208;atom provide new platforms for sensing magnetic interactions, performing quantum operations, and simulating spin Hamiltonians at the atomic scale.








Abstract
The desire to control and measure individual quantum systems such as atoms and ions in a vacuum has led to significant scientific and engineering developments in the past decades that form the basis of today's quantum information science. Single atoms and molecules on surfaces, on the other hand, are heavily investigated by physicists, chemists, and material scientists in search of novel electronic and magnetic functionalities. These two paths crossed in 2015 when it was&#160;first clearly demonstrated that individual spins on a surface can be coherently controlled and read out in an all&#8208;electrical fashion. The enabling technique is a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and electron spin resonance, which offers unprecedented coherent controllability at the Angstrom length scale. This review aims to illustrate the essential ingredients that allow the quantum operations of single spins on surfaces. Three domains of applications of surface spins, namely quantum sensing, quantum control, and quantum simulation, are discussed with physical principles explained and examples presented. Enabled by the atomically&#8208;precise fabrication capability of STM, single spins on surfaces might one day lead to the realization of quantum nanodevices and artificial quantum materials at the atomic&#160;scale.

         <title>Nanomaterials for Quantum Information Science and Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The basic concepts of quantum computing, communications, and sensing technologies are introduced. The current materials&#8208;related challenges in current quantum devices are identified and how nanoscale and low&#8208;dimensional materials may be used to overcome these challenges is considered. Theoretical and experimental studies on nanomaterials for quantum devices are reviewed.








Abstract
Quantum information science and engineering (QISE)&#8212;which entails the use of quantum mechanical states for information processing, communications, and sensing&#8212;and the area of nanoscience and nanotechnology have dominated condensed matter physics and materials science research in the 21st century. Solid&#8208;state devices for QISE have, to this point, predominantly been designed with bulk materials as their constituents. This review considers how nanomaterials (i.e., materials with intrinsic quantum confinement) may offer inherent advantages over conventional materials for QISE. The materials challenges for specific types of qubits, along with how emerging nanomaterials may overcome these challenges, are identified. Challenges for and progress toward nanomaterials&#8208;based quantum devices are condidered. The overall aim of the review is to help close the gap between the nanotechnology and quantum information communities and inspire research that will lead to next&#8208;generation quantum devices for scalable and practical quantum applications.

         <title>Benchmarking Noise and Dephasing in Emerging Electrical Materials for Quantum Technologies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The available data on low&#8208;frequency fluctuations in electrical properties are reviewed to benchmark dephasing and noise in materials that are of direct interest to quantum technologies. The physical processes causing dephasing and noise are elaborated, the impact of both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters is evaluated, and it is hoped that a clearer pathway to design, characterize and implement both material and devices for quantum&#160;applications is thus provided.








Abstract
As quantum technologies develop, a specific class of electrically conducting materials is rapidly gaining interest because they not only form the core quantum&#8208;enabled elements in superconducting qubits, semiconductor nanostructures, or sensing devices, but also the peripheral circuitry. The phase coherence of the electronic wave function in these emerging materials will be crucial when incorporated in the quantum architecture. The loss of phase memory, or dephasing, occurs when a quantum system interacts with the fluctuations in the local electromagnetic environment, which manifests in &#8220;noise&#8221; in the electrical conductivity. Hence, characterizing these materials and devices therefrom, for quantum applications, requires evaluation of both dephasing and noise, although there are very few materials where these properties are investigated simultaneously. Here, the available data on magnetotransport and low&#8208;frequency fluctuations in electrical conductivity are reviewed to benchmark the dephasing and noise. The focus is on new materials that are of direct interest to quantum technologies. The physical processes causing dephasing and noise in these systems are elaborated, the impact of both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters from materials synthesis and devices realization are evaluated, and it is hoped that a clearer pathway to design and characterize both material and devices for quantum&#160;applications is thus provided.

2D layered materials, exhibiting exotic structural, electrical, and magnetic properties, provide a superior platform for implementing novel quantum devices&#8212;from tunneling diodes and transistors, to spin&#8208;FETs, valley&#8208;FETs, and qubits. The physics are highlighted and the opportunities and challenges of exploiting the unique quantum properties of 2D materials to enable revolutionary ultra&#8208;energy&#8208;efficient quantum devices are analyzed.








Abstract
As an approximation to the quantum state of solids, the band theory, developed nearly seven decades ago, fostered the advance of modern integrated solid&#8208;state electronics, one of the most successful technologies in the history of human civilization. Nonetheless, their rapidly growing energy consumption and accompanied environmental issues call for more energy&#8208;efficient electronics and optoelectronics, which necessitate the exploration of more advanced quantum mechanical effects, such as band&#8208;to&#8208;band tunneling, spin&#8211;orbit coupling, spin&#8211;valley locking, and quantum entanglement. The emerging 2D layered materials, featured by their exotic electrical, magnetic, optical, and structural properties, provide a revolutionary low&#8208;dimensional and manufacture&#8208;friendly platform (and many more opportunities) to implement these quantum&#8208;engineered devices, compared to the traditional electronic materials system. Here, the progress in quantum&#8208;engineered devices is reviewed and the opportunities/challenges of exploiting 2D materials are analyzed to highlight their unique quantum properties that enable novel energy&#8208;efficient devices, and useful insights to quantum device engineers and 2D&#8208;material scientists are provided.

         <title>Recent Development of Ultrafast Optical Characterizations for Quantum Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advent of ultrashort optical pulses has provided unprecedented opportunities to probe and manipulate physical properties of quantum materials. There have been rapid growing discoveries of photoinduced new phenomena and nonlinear properties. A review on recent progress of ultrafast optical characterization and manipulation of quantum states, specifically in systems with broken&#8208;symmetry states or phase transitions, and prospects are provided.








Abstract
The advent of intense ultrashort optical pulses spanning a frequency range from terahertz to the visible has opened a new era in the experimental investigation and manipulation of quantum materials. The generation of strong optical field in an ultrashort time scale enables the steering of quantum materials nonadiabatically, inducing novel phenomenon or creating new phases which may not have an equilibrium counterpart. Ultrafast time&#8208;resolved optical techniques have provided rich information and played an important role in characterization of the nonequilibrium and nonlinear properties of solid systems. Here, some of the recent progress of ultrafast optical techniques and their applications to the detection and manipulation of physical properties in selected quantum materials are reviewed. Specifically, the new development in the detection of the Higgs mode and photoinduced nonequilibrium response in the study of superconductors by time&#8208;resolved terahertz spectroscopy are discussed.
