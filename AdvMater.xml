         <title>Isolating Single and Few Atoms for Enhanced Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed metal catalysts have become an attractive frontier in the field of catalysis. The latest advances in synthesis strategies, local environment regulation, and catalytic applications, covering single&#8208;atom, dual&#8208;atom, and atomic cluster catalysts, are reviewed, while practical solutions to inspire the microenvironment regulation of active sites in the isolated few atom systems are provided.








Abstract
Atomically dispersed metal catalysts have triggered great interest in the field of catalysis owing to their unique features. Isolated single or few metal atoms can be anchored on substrates via chemical bonding or space confinement to maximize atom utilization efficiency. The key challenge lies in precisely regulating the geometric and electronic structure of the active metal centers, thus significantly influencing the catalytic properties. Although several reviews have been published on the preparation, characterization, and application of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), the comprehensive understanding of SACs, dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs), and atomic clusters has never been systematically summarized. Here, recent advances in the engineering of local environments of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art SACs, DACs, and atomic clusters for enhanced catalytic performance are highlighted. Firstly, various synthesis approaches for SACs, DACs, and atomic clusters are presented. Then, special attention is focused on the elucidation of local environments in terms of electronic state and coordination structure. Furthermore, a comprehensive summary of isolated single and few atoms for the applications of thermocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and photocatalysis is provided. Finally, the potential challenges and future opportunities in this emerging field are presented. This review will pave the way to regulate the microenvironment of the active site for boosting catalytic processes.

         <title>Impact of Side&#8208;Chain Hydrophilicity on Packing, Swelling, and Ion Interactions in Oxy&#8208;Bithiophene Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular dynamics and X&#8208;ray diffraction is used to characterize mixed&#8208;transport conjugated polymers packing, ability to swell, and chelate with ions. It is shown that glycol side chains can induce tilted &#960;&#8208;stacks, allow water flow into the lamellar stack, and form single and double bound chelates.








Abstract
Exchanging hydrophobic alkyl&#8208;based side chains to hydrophilic glycol&#8208;based side chains is a widely adopted method for improving mixed&#8208;transport device performance, despite the impact on solid&#8208;state packing and polymer&#8208;electrolyte interactions being poorly understood. Presented here is a molecular dynamics (MD) force field for modeling alkoxylated and glycolated polythiophenes. The force field is validated against known packing motifs for their monomer crystals. MD simulations, coupled with X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), show that alkoxylated polythiophenes will pack with a &#8220;tilted stack&#8221; and straight interdigitating side chains, whilst their glycolated counterpart will pack with a &#8220;deflected stack&#8221; and an s&#8208;bend side&#8208;chain configuration. MD simulations reveal water penetration pathways into the alkoxylated and glycolated crystals&#8212;through the &#960;&#8208;stack and through the lamellar stack respectively. Finally, the two distinct ways triethylene glycol polymers can bind to cations are revealed, showing the formation of a metastable single bound state, or an energetically deep double bound state, both with a strong side&#8208;chain length dependence. The minimum energy pathways for the formation of the chelates are identified, showing the physical process through which cations can bind to one or two side chains of a glycolated polythiophene, with consequences for ion transport in bithiophene semiconductors.

         <title>Reversible Phase Transition for Durable Formamidinium&#8208;Dominated Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nucleation and growth mechanisms of the phase transition between &#945; and &#948; phase of formamidinium (FA)1&#8722;xCsxPbI3 are proposed. Based on these understandings, the lifetime of FA&#8208;dominated perovskite solar cells is successfully extended under humidity through either heat healing (leads to &#948;&#8208;to&#8208;&#945; phase transition) or continuous 60&#160;&#176;C heating (kinetically stabilized &#945; phase).








Abstract
Phase instability is one of the major obstacles to the wide application of formamidinium (FA)&#8208;dominated perovskite solar cells (PSCs). An in&#8208;depth investigation on relevant phase transitions is urgently needed to explore more effective phase&#8208;stabilization strategies. Herein, the reversible phase&#8208;transition process of FA1&#8722;xCsxPbI3 perovskite between photoactive phase (&#945; phase) and non&#8208;photoactive phase (&#948; phase) under humidity, as well as the reversible healing of degraded devices, is monitored. Moreover, through in situ atomic force microscopy, the kinetic transition between &#945; and &#948; phase is revealed to be the &#8220;nucleation&#8211;growth transition&#8221; process. Density functional theory calculation implies an enthalpy&#8208;driven &#945;&#8208;to&#8208;&#948; degradation process during humidity aging and an entropy&#8208;driven &#948;&#8208;to&#8208;&#945; healing process at high temperatures. The &#945; phase of FA1&#8722;xCsxPbI3 can be stabilized at elevated temperature under high humidity due to the increased nucleation barrier, and the resulting non&#8208;encapsulated PSCs retain &gt;90% of their initial efficiency after &gt;1000 h at 60&#160;&#176;C and 60% relative humidity. This finding provides a deepened understanding on the phase&#8208;transition process of FA1&#8722;xCsxPbI3 from both thermodynamics and kinetics points of view, which also presents an effective means to stabilize the &#945; phase of FA&#8208;dominated perovskites and devices for practical applications.

Abstract
The development of eco&#8208;friendly, ultralow&#8208;power and easy&#8208;to&#8208;process electronics is facing dominant challenges in emerging off&#8208;the&#8208;grid applications, such as the Internet of Things (IoTs) and extreme environment explorations at the south/north&#160;pole, in the deep sea, and in outer space. Eco&#8208;friendly, biodegradable, lightweight and flexible paper&#8208;based electronics can provide many new possibilities for next&#8208;generation devices and circuits. Here, we first built enhancement&#8208;mode (E&#8208;mode, remaining off state at zero gate voltages) carbon nanotube (CNT) complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) thin&#8208;film transistors (TFTs) on paper substrates through a printing&#8208;based process. Benefitting from the CMOS circuit style and E&#8208;mode transistors, the fabricated CMOS inverters exhibit high voltage gains (more than 11) and noise margins (up to 75% 1/2 VDD at VDD of 0.4&#160;V), and rail&#8208;to&#8208;rail operation down to a VDD as low as 0.2&#160;V and record low power dissipation as low as 0.0124 pW/&#956;m. Furthermore, the transistors and integrated circuits (ICs) show an excellent radiation tolerance of a total ionizing dose (TID) exceeding 2 Mrad with a high dose rate of 365&#8201;rad&#8201;s&#8722;1. The record power consumption and outstanding radiation tolerance behaviour achieved in paper&#8208;based and easy&#8208;to&#8208;process CNT electronics are attractive for emerging energy&#8208;saving and environmentally friendly ICs in harsh environment (such as outer&#8208;space) applications.

&lt;p&gt;The development of eco-friendly, ultralow-power and easy-to-process electronics is facing dominant challenges in emerging off-the-grid applications, such as the Internet of Things (IoTs) and extreme environment explorations at the south/north&#160;pole, in the deep sea, and in outer space. Eco-friendly, biodegradable, lightweight and flexible paper-based electronics can provide many new possibilities for next-generation devices and circuits. Here, we first built enhancement-mode (E-mode, remaining off state at zero gate voltages) carbon nanotube (CNT) complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) thin-film transistors (TFTs) on paper substrates through a printing-based process. Benefitting from the CMOS circuit style and E-mode transistors, the fabricated CMOS inverters exhibit high voltage gains (more than 11) and noise margins (up to 75% 1/2 V&lt;sub&gt;DD&lt;/sub&gt; at V&lt;sub&gt;DD&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.4&#160;V), and rail-to-rail operation down to a V&lt;sub&gt;DD&lt;/sub&gt; as low as 0.2&#160;V and record low power dissipation as low as 0.0124 pW/&#956;m.

         <title>Room Temperature Negative Differential Resistance and High Tunneling Current Density in GeSn Esaki Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Tunnel field&#8208;effect transistors (TFETs) are a promising candidate for low&#8208;power applications owing to their steep subthreshold swing of sub&#8208;60 mV/decade. For silicon or germanium&#8208;based TFETs, the drive current is low due to the indirect band&#8208;to&#8208;band tunneling (BTBT) process. Direct&#8208;bandgap germanium&#8208;tin (GeSn) can boost the TFET performance since phonon participation is not required during the tunneling process. Esaki diodes with negative differential resistance (NDR) are used to characterize the BTBT properties and calibrate the tunneling rates for TFET applications. This work demonstrates high&#8208;performance GeSn Esaki diodes with clear NDR at room temperature with very high peak&#8208;to&#8208;valley current ratios of 15 &#8764; 53 from 300 K to 4 K. We&#160;also report a record high peak current density of 545 kA/cm2 at 4 K for the tensile&#8208;strained Ge0.925Sn0.075 device (strain &#8764; 0.6 %). By applying tensile stresses to n&#8208;GeSn epitaxial films, the direct BTBT process dominates, leading to high tunneling rates. Hall measurements further confirm that more electrons populate in the direct &#915; valley in the tensile&#8208;strained n&#8208;GeSn epitaxial&#160;films.

&lt;p&gt;Tunnel field-effect transistors (TFETs) are a promising candidate for low-power applications owing to their steep subthreshold swing of sub-60 mV/decade. For silicon or germanium-based TFETs, the drive current is low due to the indirect band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) process. Direct-bandgap germanium-tin (GeSn) can boost the TFET performance since phonon participation is not required during the tunneling process. Esaki diodes with negative differential resistance (NDR) are used to characterize the BTBT properties and calibrate the tunneling rates for TFET applications. This work demonstrates high-performance GeSn Esaki diodes with clear NDR at room temperature with very high peak-to-valley current ratios of 15 &#8764; 53 from 300 K to 4 K. We&#160;also report a record high peak current density of 545 kA/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 4 K for the tensile-strained Ge&lt;sub&gt;0.925&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.075&lt;/sub&gt; device (strain &#8764; 0.6 %). By applying tensile stresses to n-GeSn epitaxial films, the direct BTBT process dominates, leading to high tunneling rates.

         <title>Interspace and Vacancy Modulation: Promoting the Zinc Storage of Alcohol&#8208;Based Organic&#8211;Inorganic Cathode in Water&#8211;Organic Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Expanding interspace and introducing vacancies are desired to promote the mobility of Zn ions and unlock the inactive sites of layered cathode. However, this two&#8208;point modulation has not yet been achieved simultaneously in vanadium phosphate. Here, we propose a strategy for fabricating an alcohol&#8208;based organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid material, VO1&#8208;xPO4&#8226;0.56C6H14O4, to realise the conjoint modulation of d&#8208;interspace and oxygen vacancies. Peculiar triglycol molecules with an inclined orientation in the interlayer also boost the improvement in the conversion rate of V5+ to V4+ and the intensity of the P&#8208;O bond. Their synergism can ensure steerable adjustment for intercalation kinetics and electron transport, as well as realise high chemical reactivity and redox&#8208;center optimisation, leading to at least 200% increase in capacity. Using water&#8211;organic electrolyte, the designed Zn&#8208;ion batteries with an ultrahigh&#8208;rate profile delivered a long&#8208;term durability (fivefold greater than pristine material) and an excellent energy density of &#8764;142&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 (including masses of cathode and anode), thereby substantially outstripping most recently reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art zinc&#8208;ion batteries. This work proved the feasibility to realise the two&#8208;point modulation by using organic intercalants for exploiting high&#8208;performance new 2D materials.

         <title>Efficient and stable perovskite solar cells with a high open&#8208;circuit voltage over 1.2&#160;V achieved by a dual&#8208;side passivation layer</title>

Abstract
Suppressing nonradiative recombination at the interface between the organometal halide perovskite (PVK) and the charge transport layer (CTL) is crucial for improving the efficiency and stability of PVK&#8208;based solar cells (PSCs). Here, we synthesized a new bathocuproine (BCP)&#8208;based nonconjugated polyelectrolyte (poly&#8208;BCP) and introduced this as a &#8220;dual&#8208;side passivation layer&#8221; between the tin oxide (SnO2) CTL and the PVK absorber. Poly&#8208;BCP significantly suppressed both bulk and interfacial nonradiative recombination by passivating oxygen&#8208;vacancy defects from the SnO2 side and simultaneously scavenging ionic defects from the other (PVK) side. Therefore, PSCs with poly&#8208;BCP exhibited a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.4% and a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.21&#160;V with a reduced voltage loss (PVK bandgap of 1.56&#160;eV). The nonencapsulated PSCs also showed excellent long&#8208;term stability by retaining 93% of the initial PCE after 700 hours under continuous 1&#8208;sun irradiation in nitrogen atmosphere conditions.

         <title>A Novel Multi&#8208;sulfur Source Collaborative Chemical Bath Deposition Technology Enables 8%&#8208;efficiency Sb2S3 Planar Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sb2S3 as a light&#8208;harvesting material has attracted great attention for applications in both single&#8208;junction and tandem solar cells. Such solar cell has been faced with current challenge of low power conversion efficiency (PCE), which has stagnated for eight years. It has been recognized that the synthesis of high&#8208;quality absorber film plays a critical role in efficiency improvement. Here, using fresh precursor materials for antimony (antimony potassium tartrate) and combined sulfur (sodium thiosulfate and thioacetamide), we created a unique chemical bath deposition procedure. Due to the complexation of sodium thiosulfate and the advantageous hydrolysis cooperation between these two sulfur sources, the heterogeneous nucleation and the S2&#8211; releasing processes are boosted. As a result, there are noticeable improvements in the deposition rate, film morphology, crystallinity, and preferred orientations. Additionally, the improved film quality efficiently lowers charge trapping capacity, suppresses carrier recombination, and prolongs carrier lifetimes, leading to significantly improved photoelectric properties. Ultimately, the PCE exceeded 8% for the first time since 2014, representing the highest efficiency in all kinds of Sb2S3 solar cells to date. This study is expected to shed new light on the fabrication of high&#8208;quality Sb2S3 film and further efficiency improvement in Sb2S3 solar cells.

         <title>Sprayable hydrogel for instant sealing of vascular anastomosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Bleeding&#8208;related complications following vascular surgeries occur in up to half of the patients&#8212;500,000 cases annually in the US alone. This results in additional procedures, increased mortality rate, and prolonged hospitalization, posing a burden on the healthcare system. Commercially&#8208;available materials rely, in large, on forming covalent bonds between the tissue and the biomaterial to achieve adhesion. Here we show that a biomaterial based on oxidized alginate and oxidized dextran together with PAMAM dendrimer amine provides simultaneous electrostatic&#8208; and covalent&#8208;interactions between the biomaterial and the tissue, maximizing adhesion. We found that our material withstands supraphysiological pressures (&#8764;300&#160;mmHg) and prevents bleeding in a rabbit aortic puncture model and in a pig carotid bilateral polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft model&#8212;achieving superior performance to commercially&#8208;available materials such as Tisseel and BioGlue. Material biocompatibility was validated in comprehensive in vitro and in vivo studies in accordance with the FDA guidelines, including in&#8208;vitro Neutral Red Uptake (NRU) test, subcutaneous implantation in rabbits, ames genotoxicity and guinea&#8208;pig maximization&#8208;test. This material has the potential to provide with adequate seal and reduced complications following complex vascular surgeries, including hard&#8208;to&#8208;seal tissue:graft interfaces.

Abstract
Lung fibrosis, as one of the major post&#8208;COVID complications, is a progressive and ultimately fatal disease without a cure. Here, we introduce an organ&#8208; and disease&#8208;specific&#160;in vitro&#160;mini&#8208;lung fibrosis model equipped with non&#8208;invasive real&#8208;time monitoring of cell mechanics as a functional readout. To establish an intricate multi&#8208;culture model under physiologic conditions, we developed a biomimetic ultrathin basement (BETA) membrane (&lt;1&#160;&#956;m)&#160;with unique properties, including biocompatibility,&#160;permeability, and high elasticity (&lt;10&#160;kPa) for cell culturing under air&#8208;liquid interface (ALI) and cyclic mechanical stretch conditions. The human&#8208;based triple co&#8208;culture fibrosis model, which includes epithelial and endothelial cell lines combined with primary fibroblasts from&#160;idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients established on the BETA membrane, is integrated into a millifluidic bioreactor system (CIVIC) with dose&#8208;controlled aerosolized drug delivery, mimicking inhalation therapy. We show the real&#8208;time measurement of cell/tissue stiffness (and compliance) as a clinical biomarker of the progression/attenuation of fibrosis upon drug treatment, which was confirmed for&#160;inhaled&#160;Nintedanib &#8211;an FDA&#8208;approved anti&#8208;fibrosis drug.&#160;The mini&#8208;lung fibrosis model allows the combined longitudinal testing of pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of drugs, which is expected to enhance the predictive capacity of&#160;preclinical&#160;models&#160;and hence facilitate the development of approved therapies for lung fibrosis.

         <title>A Silica Reinforced Composite Electrolyte with Greatly Enhanced Interfacial Lithium&#8208;Ion Transfer Kinetics for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

Abstract
Developing quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes with superior ionic conductivity and high mechanical strength is urgently desired to improve the safety and cycling stability of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, a novel solid&#8208;like electrolyte with enhanced Li+ interfacial transfer kinetics is rationally designed by soaking bulk nanostructured silica&#8208;polymer composites in liquid electrolytes. Benefiting from the high content of inorganic silica and abundant interfaces for fast Li+ transport channels, the prepared solid&#8208;like electrolyte exhibits superb ionic conductivity and high mechanical strength. Furthermore, fumed silica with a high specific area in the solid&#8208;like electrolyte could homogenize Li+ flux and electrical field gradient. More importantly, a Li2S&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is constructed on lithium metal due to the intimate ion coordination in the solid&#8208;like electrolyte. Therefore, the lithium metal anode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance in symmetric Li&#8208;Li cells due to the merits of superior ionic conductivity, high modulus, Li2S rich SEI as well as the homogeneous Li+ flux. Full cells with LiFePO4 cathode can still get a capacity retention of 98% at 0.2C after 400 cycles. The proposed strategy to on quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes provides a promising paradigm for next&#8208;generation metal&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>Modular Nanostructures Facilitate Low Thermal Conductivity and Ultra&#8208;High Thermoelectric Performance in n&#8208;type SnSe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Single crystals of SnSe have gained considerable attention in thermoelectrics due to their unprecedented thermoelectric performance. However, polycrystalline SnSe is more favourable for practical applications due to its facile chemical synthesis procedure, processability and scalability. Though the thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) of p&#8208;type bulk SnSe polycrystals has reached &gt;2.5, the zT of n&#8208;type counterpart is still lower and lies around &#8764;1.5. Herein, we report record high zT of 2.0 in n&#8208;type polycrystalline SnSe0.92 + x mol% MoCl5 (x = 0 &#8211; 3) samples when measured parallel to the spark plasma sintering (SPS) pressing direction due to the simultaneous optimization of n&#8208;type carrier concentration and enhanced phonon scattering by incorporating modular nano&#8208;heterostructures in SnSe matrix. The successful creation of Se vacancy and substitution of Mo5+ at Sn2+ and Cl&#8722; ions at Se2&#8722; sites effectively enhance the total n&#8208;type carrier concentration, thus improving the electrical conductivity. Modular nanostructures of layered intergrowth [(SnSe)1.05]m(MoSe2)n like compounds embedded in SnSe matrix scatters the phonons significantly leading to an ultra&#8208;low lattice thermal conductivity of &#8764;0.26&#160;W/mK at 798 K in SnSe0.92 + 3 mol% MoCl5. Here, the 2D layered modular intergrowth compound resembles the nano&#8208;heterostructure and their periodicity of 1.2 &#8211; 2.6&#160;nm in the SnSe matrix matches the phonon mean free path of SnSe, thereby block the heat carrying phonons which result in low &#954;lat and ultra&#8208;high thermoelectric performance in n&#8208;type SnSe.

         <title>Simultaneously Enhancing Exciton/Charge Transport in Organic Solar Cells by Organoboron Additive</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Efficient exciton diffusion and charge transport play a vital role in advancing power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). Here, a facile strategy is presented to simultaneously enhance exciton/charge transport of the widely studied PM6:Y6&#8208;based OSCs by employing highly emissive trans&#8208;bis(dimesitylboron)stilbene (BBS) as a solid additive. BBS transforms the emissive sites from more H&#8208;type aggregate into more J&#8208;type aggregate, which benefits the resonance energy transfer for PM6 exciton diffusion and energy transfer from PM6 to Y6. Transient gated photoluminescence spectroscopy measurement indicates that addition of BBS improves exciton diffusion coefficient of PM6 and dissociation of PM6 excitons in PM6:Y6:BBS film. Transient absorption spectroscopy measurement confirms faster charge generation in PM6:Y6:BBS. Moreover, BBS helps improve Y6 crystallization, and current sensing atomic force microscopy characterization reveals improved charge carrier diffusion length in PM6:Y6:BBS. Owing to enhanced exciton diffusion, exciton dissociation, charge generation and charge transport, as well as reduced charge recombination and energy loss, a higher PCE of 17.6% with simultaneously improved open&#8208;circuit voltage, short&#8208;circuit current density and fill factor is achieved for the PM6:Y6:BBS devices compared to the devices without BBS (16.2%).

         <title>Eliminating the Micropore Confinement Effect of Carbonaceous Electrodes for Promoting Zn&#8208;Ion Storage Capability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Zn2+ storage capability of carbonaceous materials is boosted by eliminating the micropore confinement effect and synchronously enhancing the utilization of active sites. Systematic ex situ characterizations coupled with in situ electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance and Raman spectra certify that the excellent Zn2+ storage capability is attributed to the synergistic effect of Zn2+, H+, and SO42&#8211; co&#8208;adsorption mechanism and invertible chemical adsorption.








Abstract
Zinc&#8208;ion capacitors (ZICs) are promising technology for large&#8208;scale energy storage by integrating the attributes of supercapacitors and zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Unfortunately, the insufficient Zn2+&#8208;storage active sites of carbonaceous cathode materials and the mismatch of pore sizes with charge carriers lead to unsatisfactory Zn2+ storage capability. Herein, new insights for boosting Zn2+ storage capability of activated nitrogen&#8208;doped hierarchical porous carbon materials (ANHPC&#8208;x) are&#160;reported by effectively eliminating the micropore confinement effect and synchronously elevating the utilization of active sites. Therefore, the best&#8208;performed ANHPC&#8208;2 delivers impressive electrochemical properties for ZICs in terms of excellent capacity (199.1 mAh g&#8722;1), energy density (155.2&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1), and durability (65&#160;000 cycles). Systematic ex situ&#160;characterizations together with in situ&#160;electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance and Raman spectra measurements reveal that the remarkable electrochemical performance is assigned to the synergism of the Zn2+, H+, and SO42&#8722; co&#8208;adsorption mechanism and reversible chemical adsorption. Furthermore, the ANHPC&#8208;2&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state ZIC demonstrates excellent electrochemical capability with an ultralong lifespan of up to 100 000 cycles. This work not only provides a promising strategy to improve the Zn2+ storage capability of carbonaceous materials but also sheds lights on charge&#8208;storage mechanism and advanced electrode materials&#8217; design for ZICs toward practical applications.

&lt;p&gt;Zinc-ion capacitors (ZICs) are promising technology for large-scale energy storage by integrating the attributes of supercapacitors and zinc-ion batteries. Unfortunately, the insufficient Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-storage active sites of carbonaceous cathode materials and the mismatch of pore sizes with charge carriers lead to unsatisfactory Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; storage capability. Herein, new insights for boosting Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; storage capability of activated nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon materials (ANHPC-&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;) are&#160;reported by effectively eliminating the micropore confinement effect and synchronously elevating the utilization of active sites. Therefore, the best-performed ANHPC-2 delivers impressive electrochemical properties for ZICs in terms of excellent capacity (199.1 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), energy density (155.2&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and durability (65&#160;000 cycles). Systematic ex situ&#160;characterizations together with in situ&#160;electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance and Raman spectra measurements reveal that the remarkable electrochemical performance is assigned to the synergism of the Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; co-adsorption mechanism and reversible chemical adsorption. Furthermore, the ANHPC-2-based quasi-solid-state ZIC demonstrates excellent electrochemical capability with an ultralong lifespan of up to 100 000 cycles. This work not only provides a promising strategy to improve the Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; storage capability of carbonaceous materials but also sheds lights on charge-storage mechanism and advanced electrode materials&#8217; design for ZICs toward practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ionogel&#8208;Based Membranes for Safe Lithium/Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionogel&#8208;electrolyte membranes composed of ionic liquids and solid matrices have attracted extensive interest because of their nonvolatility, nonflammability, and superior chemical and electrochemical properties. The most recent advances of ionogel electrolytes in lithium/sodium batteries are summarized. In addition, the current challenges and insights on the future development of ionogel electrolytes for advanced safe lithium/sodium batteries are proposed.








Abstract
Alkali (lithium, sodium)&#8208;based second batteries are considered one of the brightest candidates for energy&#8208;storage applications in order to utilize the random and intermittent renewable energy to achieve carbon neutrality. Conventional lithium/sodium batteries containing liquid organic electrolytes are vulnerable to electrolytes leakage and even combustion, which hinders their large&#8208;scale and reliable application. All&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes which are considered to have better safety have been developed in recent years. However, most of them suffer from low ionic conductivity and large interfacial resistance with the electrode. Ionogel&#8208;electrolyte membranes composed of ionic liquids and solid matrices, have attracted much attention because of their nonvolatility, nonflammability, and superior chemical and electrochemical properties. This review focuses on the most recent advances of ionogel electrolytes that sprang up with the emerging demand and progress of safe lithium/sodium batteries. The ionogel&#8208;electrolyte membranes are discussed based on the framework components and preparation methods. Their structure and properties, including ionic conductivity, mechanical strength, electrochemical stabilities, and so on, are demonstrated in combination with their applications. The current challenges and insights on the future development of ionogel electrolytes for advanced safe lithium/sodium batteries are also proposed.

         <title>Efficient and Stable 3D/2D Perovskite Solar Cells through Vertical Heterostructures with (BA)4AgBiBr8 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(BA)4AgBiBr8 2D perovskite nanosheets are used to construct vertical heterostructures with 3D perovskite to serve as a barrier layer to suppress the ion diffusion and nonradiation recombination from 3D perovskite to metal electrode. The performance and stability of perovskite solar cells are simultaneously enhanced after the incorporation of the 2D nanosheets.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have drawn great attention due to their high processability and superior photovoltaic properties. However, their further development is often hindered by severe nonradiative recombination at interfaces that decreases power conversion efficiency (PCE). To this end, a facile strategy to construct a 3D/2D vertical heterostructure to reduce the energy loss in PVSCs is developed. The heterostructure is contrived through the van der Waals integration of 2D perovskite ((BA)4AgBiBr8) nanosheets onto the surface of 3D&#8208;FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskites. The large bandgap of (BA)4AgBiBr8 enables the formation of type&#8208;I heterojunction with 3D&#8208;FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskites, which serves as a barrier to suppress the trap&#8208;assisted recombination at the interface. As a result, a satisfying PCE of 24.48% is achieved with an improved open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) from 1.13 to 1.17&#160;V. Moreover, the 2D perovskite nanosheets can effectively mitigate the iodide ion diffusion from perovskite to the metal electrode, hence enhancing the device stability. 3D/2D architectured devices retain &#8776;90% of their initial PCE under continuous illumination or heating after 1000 h, which are superior to 3D&#8208;based devices. This work provides an effective and controllable strategy to construct 3D/2D vertical heterostructure to simultaneously boost the efficiency and stability of PVSCs.

         <title>Enabling High&#8208;Voltage &#8220;Superconcentrated Ionogel&#8208;in&#8208;Ceramic&#8221; Hybrid Electrolyte with Ultrahigh Ionic Conductivity and Single Li+&#8208;Ion Transference Number</title>

         <dc:description>
A unique &#8220;superconcentrated ionogel&#8208;in&#8208;ceramic&#8221; electrolyte is newly developed by conglutinating garnet with superconcentrated ionogel. Such electrolyte not only demonstrates a superior ionic conductivity of 1.33 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C, but also a large Li+&#8208;ion transference number of 0.89. The quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries using this electrolyte reveal excellent cycling performance.








Abstract
High room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivities, large Li+&#8208;ion transference numbers, and good compatibility with both Li&#8208;metal anodes and high&#8208;voltage cathodes of the solid electrolytes are the essential requirements for practical solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries. Herein, a unique &#8220;superconcentrated ionogel&#8208;in&#8208;ceramic&#8221; (SIC) electrolyte prepared by an in situ thermally initiated radical polymerization is reported. Solid&#8208;state static 7Li NMR and molecular dynamics simulation reveal the roles of ceramic in Li+ local environments and transport in the SIC electrolyte. The SIC electrolyte not only exhibits an ultrahigh ionic conductivity of 1.33 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C, but also a Li+&#8208;ion transference number as high as 0.89, together with a low electronic conductivity of 3.14 &#215; 10&#8722;10 S cm&#8722;1 and a wide electrochemical stability window of 5.5&#160;V versus Li/Li+. Applications of the SIC electrolyte in Li||LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 and Li||LiFePO4 batteries further demonstrate the high rate and long cycle life. This study, therefore, provides a promising hybrid electrolyte for safe and high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>3D Printing Flexible Sodium&#8208;Ion Microbatteries with Ultrahigh Areal Capacity and Robust Rate Capability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A prototype of fully 3D&#8208;printed planar flexible sodium&#8208;ion microbatteries is demonstrated with 3D interconnected conductive thick microelectrodes via multilayer printing for ultrahigh areal capacity and robust rate capability, benefiting from the elaborate printable inks and impressive ion/charge&#8208;transfer kinetics.








Abstract
Rechargeable sodium&#8208;ion microbatteries (NIMBs) constructed using low&#8208;cost and abundant raw materials in planar configuration with both cathode and anode on the same substrate hold promise for powering coplanar microelectronics, but are hindered by the low areal capacity owing to the thin microelectrodes. Here, a prototype of planar and flexible 3D&#8208;printed NIMBs is demonstrated with 3D interconnected conductive thick microelectrodes for ultrahigh areal capacity and boosted rate capability. Rationally optimized 3D printable inks with appropriate viscosities and high conductivity allow the multilayer printing of NIMB microelectrodes reaching a very high thickness of &#8776;1200&#160;&#181;m while maintaining effective ion and electron&#8208;transfer pathways in them. Consequently, the 3D&#8208;printed NIMBs deliver superior areal capacity of 4.5 mAh cm&#8722;2 (2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art printed microbatteries. The NIMBs show enhanced rate capability with 3.6 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 40&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and robust long&#8208;term cycle life up to 6000 cycles. Furthermore, the planar NIMB microelectrodes, despite the large thickness, exhibit decent mechanical flexibility under various bending conditions. This work opens a new avenue for the construction of high&#8208;performance NIMBs with thick microelectrodes capable of powering flexible microelectronics.

The NIMBs show enhanced rate capability with 3.6 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 40&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and robust long-term cycle life up to 6000 cycles. Furthermore, the planar NIMB microelectrodes, despite the large thickness, exhibit decent mechanical flexibility under various bending conditions. This work opens a new avenue for the construction of high-performance NIMBs with thick microelectrodes capable of powering flexible microelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Edge&#8208;Site Engineering of Defective Fe&#8211;N4 Nanozymes with Boosted Catalase&#8208;Like Performance for Retinal Vasculopathies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron single&#8208;atom nanozyme (Fe&#8208;SANzyme) with defective Fe&#8211;N4 sites is fabricated by edge&#8208;site engineering. The abundant edge&#8208;hosted Fe&#8211;N4 sites endow Fe&#8208;SANzyme with boosted catalase&#8208;like activity, which is significantly higher than the reference with integral Fe&#8211;N4 sites. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, pathological vascular dysfunction is effectively alleviated in animal models of retinal vasculopathies treated with antioxidant Fe&#8208;SANzyme.








Abstract
Extensive efforts are devoted to refining metal sites for optimizing the catalytic performance of single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SANzymes), while the contribution of the defect environment of neighboring metal sites lacks attention. Herein, an iron&#8208;based SANzyme (Fe&#8208;SANzyme) is rationally designed by edge&#8208;site engineering, which intensively exposes edge&#8208;hosted defective Fe&#8211;N4 atomic sites anchored in hierarchical mesoporous structures. The Fe&#8208;SANzyme exhibits excellent catalase&#8208;like activity capable of efficiently catalyzing the decomposition of H2O2 into O2 and H2O, with a catalytic kinetic KM value superior to that of natural catalase and reported nanozymes. The mechanistic studies depict that the defects introduce notable charge transfer from the Fe atom to the carbon matrix, making the central Fe more activated to strengthen the interaction with H2O2 and weaken the O&#63743;O bond. By performing catalase&#8208;like catalysis, the Fe&#8208;SANzyme significantly scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS) and alleviates oxidative stress, thus eliminating the pathological angiogenesis in animal models of retinal vasculopathies without affecting the repair of normal vessels. This work provides a new way to refine SANzymes by engineering the defect environment and geometric structure around metal sites, and demonstrates the potential therapeutic effects of the nanozyme on retinal vasculopathies.

         <title>Dynamic Liquid Metal Catalysts for Boosted Lithium Polysulfides Redox Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gallium&#8211;tin alloy, one of the promising liquid metals at room temperature, is applied to lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries as a novel liquid electrocatalyst with a dynamic feature, which can drastically reduce the activation energy barrier of the lithium polysulfides redox reaction, enhance the overall electrochemical kinetics, and achieve improvement of the specific energy density of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.








Abstract
Designing efficient electrocatalysts with high electroconductivity, strong chemisorption, and superior catalytical efficiency to realize rapid kinetics of the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) conversion process is crucial for practical lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery applications. Unfortunately, most current electrocatalysts cannot maintain long&#8208;term stability due to the possible failure of catalytic sites. Herein, a novel dynamic electrocatalytic strategy with the liquid metal (i.e., gallium&#8211;tin, EGaSn) to facilitate LiPSs redox reaction is reported. The combined theoretical simulations and microstructure experiment analysis reveal that Sn atoms dynamically distributed in the liquid Ga matrix act as the main active catalytic center. Meanwhile, Ga provides a uniquely dynamic environment to maintain the long&#8208;term integrity of the catalytic system. With the participation of EGaSn, a tailor&#8208;made 2 Ah Li&#8211;S pouch cell with a specific energy density of 307.7&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 is realized. This work opens up new opportunities for liquid&#8208;phase binary alloys as electrocatalysts for high&#8208;specific&#8208;energy Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Atomically Thin Synapse Networks on Van Der Waals Photo&#8208;Memtransistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of an atomistic synaptic network on an atomically thin van der Waals heterostructure, where the ultrasmall cells built with trilayer tungsten disulfide (WS2) semiconductor serve as a gate&#8208;tunable photoactive synapse, is demonstrated. UV pulses onto the memristor generate dopants in atomic&#8208;level precision by direct light&#8211;lattice interactions, leading to the accurate modulation of the synaptic cells.








Abstract
A new type of atomically thin synaptic network on van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures is reported, where each ultrasmall cell (&#8776;2&#160;nm thick) built with trilayer WS2 semiconductor acts as a gate&#8208;tunable photoactive synapse, i.e., a photo&#8208;memtransistor. A train of UV pulses onto the WS2 memristor generates dopants in atomic&#8208;level precision by direct light&#8211;lattice interactions, which, along with the gate tunability, leads to the accurate modulation of the channel conductance for potentiation and depression of the synaptic cells. Such synaptic dynamics can be explained by a parallel atomistic resistor network model. In addition, it is shown that such a device scheme can generally be realized in other 2D vdW semiconductors, such as MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, and WSe2. Demonstration of these atomically thin photo&#8208;memtransistor arrays, where the synaptic weights can be tuned for the atomistic defect density, provides implications for a new type of artificial neural networks for parallel matrix computations with an ultrahigh integration density.

         <title>A 2D Nanoradiosensitizer Enhances Radiotherapy and Delivers STING Agonists to Potentiate Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D metal&#8211;organic layer (MOL) functions as a potent nanoradiosensitizer and a nanocarrier for agonists of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) for cancer treatment. STING agonists are conjugated onto an MOL via phosphate linkages, resulting in prolonged tumor retention and enhanced STING activation. Further combination with immune checkpoint blockade extends the scope of this local treatment to elicit systemic antitumor responses.








Abstract
Despite potent preclinical antitumor activity, activation of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) has shown modest therapeutic effects in clinical studies. Many STING agonists, including 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8211;adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP), show poor pharmacokinetic properties for sustaining STING activation in tumors and achieving optimal antitumor efficacy. Improved delivery of STING agonists and their effective combination with other treatments are needed to enhance their therapeutic effects. Herein, a 2D nanoplatform, cGAMP/MOL, is reported via conjugating cGAMP to a nanoscale metal&#8211;organic layer (MOL) for simultaneous STING activation and radiosensitization. The MOL not only exhibits strong radiosensitization effects for enhanced cancer killing and induction of immunogenic cell death, but also retains cGAMP in tumors for sustained STING activation. Compared to free cGAMP, cGAMP/MOL elicits stronger STING activation and regresses local tumors upon X&#8208;ray irradiation. Further combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor bridges innate and adaptive immune systems by activating the tumor microenvironment to elicit systemic antitumor responses.

         <title>Ultratough Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Bridged Phosphorene Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultratough hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;bridged phosphorene films, which exhibit much higher Young's modulus (316&#160;GPa) than the theoretical value (94&#160;GPa) of black phosphorene, are prepared using the electrochemical intercalation method and further proved by physical characterizations. The underlying mechanism of its excellent mechanical properties is revealed using theoretical calculations.








Abstract
The rapid development of flexible electronic devices, especially based on 2D materials, has triggered the demand for high&#8208;strength materials. Mono&#8208; or few&#8208;layer phosphorene with excellent electronic properties has attracted extensive attention. However, phosphorene is affected by its low Young's modulus when applied to flexible electronic devices. Here, a strategy via ion intercalation to significantly improve the mechanical properties of black phosphorus to generate hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;bridged phosphorene films with Young's modulus as high as 316&#160;GPa is reported. This value is several times larger than the theoretical values of 166&#160;GPa in the zigzag direction, 44&#160;GPa in the armchair direction, and the averaged Young's modulus among all directions of 94&#160;GPa. The impact of intercalation on mechanical properties is also explored. Experimental nanoindentation results obtained by atomic force microscopy indicate that the relationship between the ratio of intercalated ions to phosphorus atoms and the corresponding Young's modulus satisfies the formula E=eae&#8722;[ln(x)+b]2c(0&lt;x&#8804;1.80)\[E{\bm{ = }}{e^{a{e^{\frac{{{\bm{ - }}{{[\ln (x){\bm{ + }}b]}^2}}}{c}}}}}(0{\bm{ &amp;lt; }}x{\bm{ \le }}1.80)\]. Furthermore, a flexible NO2 gas sensor device based on this ultratough material presents excellent performance, even after 10&#160;000 bending cycles. The results provide new insight into the potential for practical applications of black phosphorus devices.

         <title>Bionic Regulators Break the Ecological Niche of Pathogenic Bacteria for Modulating Dysregulated Microbiome in Colitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the specific binding between the mannose&#8208;rich yeast cell wall (YCW) and Escherichia coli strains, a bionic regulator (CaWO4@YCW) is developed to regulate the gut microbiome. CaWO4@YCW can efficiently and precisely reprogram the gut microbiome by eliminating pathogenic bacteria and providing prebiotics, resulting in an extraordinary therapeutic advantage for DSS&#8208;induced colitis.








Abstract
Therapeutic approaches that reprogram the gut microbiome are promising strategies to alleviate and cure inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, abnormal expansion of Escherichia coli during inflammation can promote pathogenic bacteria occupying ecological niches to resist reprogramming of the microbiome. Herein, a bionic regulator (CaWO4@YCW) is developed to efficiently and precisely regulate the gut microbiome by specifically suppressing the abnormal expansion of E. coli during colitis and boosting probiotic growth. Inspired by the binding of E. coli strains to the mannose&#8208;rich yeast cell wall (YCW), YCW is chosen as the bionic shell to encapsulate CaWO4. It is demonstrated that the YCW shell endows CaWO4 with superior resistance to the harsh environment of the gastrointestinal tract and adheres to the abnormally expanded E. coli in colitis, specifically as a positioner. Notably, the high expression of calprotectin at the colitis site triggers the release of tungsten ions through calcium deprivation in CaWO4, thus inhibiting E. coli growth by replacing molybdenum in the molybdopterin cofactor. Moreover, YCW functions as a prebiotic and promotes probiotic growth. Consequently, CaWO4@YCW can efficiently and precisely reprogram the gut microbiome by eliminating pathogenic bacteria and providing prebiotics, resulting in an extraordinary therapeutic advantage for DSS&#8208;induced colitis.

         <title>Challenging Bendable Organic Single Crystal and Transistor Arrays with High Mobility and Durability toward Flexible Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large&#8208;area, ultrathin, and highly aligned organic single&#8208;crystal arrays are readily available for flexible electronics through a polymer&#8208;template&#8208;assisted molecular&#8208;assembly strategy. The proposed strategy is shown to be applicable to a variety of semiconductor molecules, demonstrating its effectiveness. The resulting transistor devices exhibit high mobility, low operating voltage, and high bendable durability.








Abstract
Bendable organic single crystals are promising candidates for flexible electronics owing to their superior charge&#8208;transport properties. However, large&#8208;area high&#8208;quality organic single crystals are rarely available on the polymer substrates generally used in flexible electronics. Here, a surface&#8208;assisted assembly strategy based on a polymer modification, poly(amic acid) (PAA), is developed to grow large&#8208;area organic singe crystals on polymer substrates using a simple drop&#8208;casting method. The unique surface properties of PAA that enable molecular solution superwetting and promote molecular ordered assembly produce an extraordinary self&#8208;driven &#8220;meniscus&#8208;guided coating&#8221; behavior, enabling the fabrication of millimeter&#8208;sized, highly aligned organic single crystals for a variety of organic semiconductors. Organic field&#8208;effect transistors based on a mode molecule of 2,7&#8208;dioctyl[1]benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b][1]benzothiophene demonstrate the highest (average) mobility of 18.6 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 (15.9 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1), attractively low operating voltage of &#8722;3&#160;V, and high flexible durability. The results shed light on the large&#8208;area fabrication of organic single crystals on polymer dielectrics toward high&#8208;performance and integrated plastic electronics.

         <title>Phase Transitional Bismuth&#8208;Based Metals Enabled Rapid Embolotherapy, Hyperthermia and Biomedical Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Embolization has been an important minimally invasive therapy for occlusion of malfunctioned vasculature and tumor treatment via target delivering embolic agents. The limitation of conventional embolic agents, such as fabrication process, precipitation time, invisibility and lack of integrated functions often leads to insufficient embolization efficacy. To overcome these drawbacks, a multifunctional bismuth&#8208;based liquid embolic agent for simultaneous realization of embolotherapy, thermotherapy as well as high contrast biomedical imaging was proposed. Benefitting from the suitable melting point, flexible nature, metallic merit and easygoing operation via injection, the versatile embolic agent can achieve rapid liquid&#8208;solid phase transition, magnetic hyperthermia and multimodal imaging capability. The bismuth&#8208;based materials are demonstrated with excellent arteriovenous embolization efficiency, and favorable biocompatibility according to in vivo investigations. Introduction of the liquid embolic agent to tumor arteries achieved evident tumor regression and rather clear imaging under CT, MRI and thermograph for consistent tracking the implants over the biological body. Further, the combined therapy coupled with thermotherapy exhibited improved therapeutic efficiency with formation of necrosis and total tumor eradiation at day 15 after the treatment. The present innovative embolic agent and the surgical principle provide a promising modality for embolization and potential theranostic platform of tumors.

         <title>Judicious Design and Rapid Manufacturing of Flexible, Mechanically Resistant Liquid&#8208;like Coating with Strong Bonding and Antifouling Abilities</title>

Abstract
Fluorine&#8208;free liquid&#8208;repellent coatings have been highly demanded for a variety of applications. However, rapid formation of coatings possessing outstanding oil repellency and strong bonding ability as well as good mechanical strength (e.g., bendability, impact resistance, and scratch resistance) remains a grand challenge. Herein, we report a robust strategy to rapidly create fluorine&#8208;free oil&#8208;repellent coatings in only 30 s via rational design of a semi&#8208;interpenetrating polymer network structure. The resulting coating manifests strong bonding capability both in air and underwater. More importantly, it not only provides unprecedented oil repellency, even to high&#8208;viscosity crude oil, but also achieves both excellent bendability and hardness. Our simple yet effective design strategy opens up a new avenue to manufacture multifunctional materials and devices with desirable features and structural complexities for applications in sustainable antifouling, drag reduction, non&#8208;destructive transportation, liquid collection, and biomedicine, among other areas.

Abstract
Currently, the role of the lysosome, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), or dictyosome in the transcription and translation of Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) was well revealed, but the role and function of mitochondria in the PD&#8208;L1 expression in tumors was still not fully researched, making it hard to offer a novel PD&#8208;L1 regulation strategy. In this research, we newly revealed that mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) depression could be used as an effective PD&#8208;L1 downregulation method. To offer an ideal and high&#8208;effective tumor mitochondria&#8208;targeted OXPHOS depression nanosystem, IR&#8208;LND was prepared by conjugating mitochondria&#8208;targeted heptamethine cyanine dye IR&#8208;68 with mitochondrial complexes &#8544; and &#8545; depression agent Lonidamine (LND), which then further self&#8208;assembled with albumin (Alb) to form IR&#8208;LND@Alb nanoparticles. By doing this, PD&#8208;L1 expression in tumors was selectively and effectively depressed by IR&#8208;LND@Alb nanoparticles. As we expected, the anti&#8208;tumor efficacy of such a PD&#8208;L1 depression strategy was superior to conventional anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 monoclonal antibodies. Interestingly, IR&#8208;LND could also be served as a novel ideal promising photodynamic therapy (PDT) drug with self&#8208;oxygen and self&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 regulation capacity. All in all, this tumor&#8208;selective metabolic reprogramming platform to reactivate immunotherapy and sensitize for PDT effect, which would open a new window for mitochondrial immunotherapy for cancer patients.

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the role of the lysosome, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), or dictyosome in the transcription and translation of Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) was well revealed, but the role and function of mitochondria in the PD-L1 expression in tumors was still not fully researched, making it hard to offer a novel PD-L1 regulation strategy. In this research, we newly revealed that mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) depression could be used as an effective PD-L1 downregulation method. To offer an ideal and high-effective tumor mitochondria-targeted OXPHOS depression nanosystem, IR-LND was prepared by conjugating mitochondria-targeted heptamethine cyanine dye IR-68 with mitochondrial complexes &#8544; and &#8545; depression agent Lonidamine (LND), which then further self-assembled with albumin (Alb) to form IR-LND@Alb nanoparticles. By doing this, PD-L1 expression in tumors was selectively and effectively depressed by IR-LND@Alb nanoparticles.

         <title>Observation of Superconducting Collective Modes from Competing Pairing Instabilities in Single&#8208;layer NbSe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In certain unconventional superconductors with sizable electronic correlations, the availability of closely competing pairing channels leads to characteristic soft collective fluctuations of the order parameters, which leave fingerprints in many observables and allow to scrutinize the phase competition. Superconducting layered materials, where electron&#8208;electron interactions are enhanced with decreasing thickness, are promising candidates to display these correlation effects. In this work, we report the existence of a soft collective mode in single&#8208;layer NbSe2, observed as a characteristic resonance excitation in high resolution tunneling spectra. This resonance is observed along with higher harmonics, its frequency &#937;/2&#916; is anticorrelated with the local superconducting gap &#916;, and its amplitude gradually vanishes by increasing the temperature and upon applying a magnetic field up to the critical values (TC and HC2), which sets an unambiguous link to the superconducting state. Aided by a microscopic model that captures the main experimental observations, we interpret this resonance as a collective Leggett mode that represents the fluctuation towards a proximate f&#8208;wave triplet state, due to subleading attraction in the triplet channel. Our findings demonstrate the fundamental role of correlations in superconducting 2D transition metal dichalcogenides, opening a path towards unconventional superconductivity in simple, scalable and transferable 2D superconductors.

         <title>The Intrinsic (Trap&#8208;free) Transistors Based on Epitaxial Single&#8208;crystal Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
We report the first experimental realization of the intrinsic (not dominated by defects) charge conduction regime in lead&#8208;halide perovskite field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). The advance has been enabled by: i) a new vapor&#8208;phase epitaxy technique that results in large&#8208;area single crystalline cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3) films with excellent structural and surface properties, including atomically&#8208;flat surface morphology, essentially free from defects and traps at the level relevant to device operation; ii) an extensive materials analysis of these films using a variety of thin film and surface probes certifying the chemical and structural quality of the material; iii) the fabrication of nearly ideal (trap&#8208;free) FETs with characteristics superior to any reported to date. These devices have allowed the investigation of the intrinsic FET and a (gated) Hall&#8208;effect carrier mobility as a function of temperature. The intrinsic mobility was found to increase on cooling from &#8764; 30 cm2V&#8211;1s&#8211;1 at room temperature to &#8764; 250 cm2V&#8211;1s&#8211;1 at 50 K, revealing a band transport mostly limited by phonon scattering. Establishing the intrinsic (phonon&#8208;limited) mobility provides a solid test for theoretical descriptions of carrier transport in perovskites, reveals basic limits to the technology, and points to a path for ubiquitous future high&#8208;performance perovskite electronic devices.

         <title>From Ferroelectric Material Optimization to Neuromorphic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Due to the voltage driven switching at low to moderate voltages combined with a nonvolatile behavior of the achieved polarization state, ferroelectric materials have a unique potential for a wide class of low power nonvolatile electronic devices. However, for many years, the competitivity of such devices was&#160;hindered by the compatibility issues of well&#8208;known ferroelectric materials based on perovskite crystals with established complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology. The discovery of ferroelectricity in hafnium oxide and related materials changed this situation and opened up a path towards scalable ferroelectric devices. The natural application of any nonvolatile device is as a memory cell in nonvolatile memories. However, the nonvolatile memory devices also built the basis for other applications like in&#8208;memory computing, nonvolatile logic or neuromorphic devices. Based on the readout mechanism three different basic ferroelectric devices can be constructed: ferroelectric capacitors, ferroelectric field effect transistors and ferroelectric tunneling junctions. In this article after an introduction first the material science of the ferroelectricity in hafnium oxide and related materials will be summarized with a special focus on tailoring the switching characteristics towards different nonvolatile applications. A summary of the current status of nonvolatile semiconductor memories using the three fundamental device architectures then lays the ground for looking into applications like in&#8208;memory computing or nonvolatile logic were&#160;the separation between memory function and switching function can be overcome. Finally a special focus will be given to showcase how the basic building blocks of spiking neural networks, the neuron and the synapse, can be realized using the basic ferroelectric devices and how they can be combined to realize neuromorphic computing systems. A summary, comparison with other technologies like resistive switching devices and finally an outlook complete the&#160;paper.

         <title>Atomically Thin, Ionic Covalent Organic Nanosheets for Stable, High&#8208;Performance Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The incorporation of charged functional groups is effective to modulate the activity of molecular complexes for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), yet the long&#8208;term heterogeneous electrolysis is often hampered due to catalysts leaching. Herein, for the first time, an electrocatalyst of atomically thin, cobalt porphyrin&#8208;based, ionic covalent organic nanosheets (CoTAP&#8208;iCONs) is synthesized via a post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy for high&#8208;performance CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. The cationic quaternary ammonium groups not only enable the formation of monolayer nanosheets due to steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion, but also facilitate the formation of *COOH intermediate as suggested by theoretical calculations. Consequently, CoTAP&#8208;iCONs exhibit higher CO2RR activity than other cobalt porphyrin&#8208;based structures: an 870% and 480% improvement of CO current densities compared to the monomer and neutral nanosheets, respectively. Additionally, the iCONs structure can accommodate the cationic moieties. In a flow cell, CoTAP&#8208;iCONs attain a very small onset overpotential of 40&#160;mV and a stable total current density of 212&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 with CO Faradaic efficiency of &gt;95% at &#8208;0.6&#160;V for 11&#160;h. Further coupling the flow electrolyzer with commercial solar cells yields a solar&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion efficiency of 13.89%. This work indicates that atom&#8208;thin, ionic nanosheet is a promising structure for achieving both tailored activity and high stability.

Abstract
Rapid development of organic electrochemical transistor (OECTs)&#8208;based circuits bring new opportunities for next&#8208;generation integrated bioelectronics. All polymer bulk heterojunction (BHJ) offers an attractive, inexpensive alternative to achieve efficient ambipolar OECTs, and building blocks of logic circuits constructed from them, but have not been investigated till date. Here, we report the first all polymer BHJ&#8208;based OECTs, consisting of a blend of new p&#8208;type ladder conjugated polymer and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art n&#8208;type ladder polymer. The optimized BHJ OECTs exhibit balanced ambipolar transistor performance, having uC* values of 2.72&#177;1.04 and 1.36&#177;0.81 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 as p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type channels, respectively. The whole ladder&#8208;type polymer BHJ also proved that side chains are not necessary for good ion transport. Instead, the polymer nanostructures play a critical role in the ion penetration and transport and thus the device performance. It also provides a facile strategy and simplifies the fabrication process, forgoing the need to pattern multiple active layers. In addition, the development of complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS)&#8208;like OECTs allows us to pursue advanced functional logic circuitry, including inverter and NAND gate as well as for amplifying electrophysiology signals. Our work opens a new approach in the design of new materials for OECTs and will contribute to the development of organic heterojunctions for ambipolar OECTs towards high performing logic circuits.&#8195;

         <title>Fully Depleted Self&#8208;Aligned Heterosandwiched Van Der Waals Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel metal&#8208;mirror&#8208;enhanced n&#8211;p&#8211;n van der Waals heterostructure is designed. The device exhibits excellent performance including high blackbody photoresponsivity up to 0.77 A W&#8722;1, high specific detectivity of 8.61&#160;&#215;&#160;1010 cm Hz1/2 W&#8722;1 under blackbody radiation, and fast response speed of &#8776;4 &#181;s.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature&#8208;operating highly sensitive mid&#8208;wavelength&#160;infrared (MWIR) photodetectors are utilized in a large number of important applications, including night vision, communications, and optical radar. Many previous studies have demonstrated uncooled MWIR photodetectors using 2D narrow&#8208;bandgap semiconductors. To date, most of these works have utilized atomically thin flakes, simple van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, or atomically thin p&#8211;n junctions as absorbers, which have difficulty in meeting the requirements for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MWIR photodetectors with a blackbody response. Here, a fully depleted self&#8208;aligned MoS2&#8208;BP&#8208;MoS2 vdW heterostructure sandwiched between two electrodes is reported. This new type of photodetector exhibits competitive performance, including a high blackbody peak photoresponsivity up to 0.77&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 and low noise&#8208;equivalent power of 2.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;14&#160;W&#160;Hz&#8722;1/2, in the MWIR region. A peak specific detectivity of 8.61&#160;&#215;&#160;1010&#160;cm Hz1/2&#160;W&#8722;1 under blackbody radiation is achieved at room temperature in the MWIR region. Importantly, the effective detection range of the device is twice that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MWIR photodetectors. Furthermore, the device presents an ultrafast response of &#8776;4&#160;&#181;s both in the visible and short&#8208;wavelength infrared bands. These results provide an ideal platform for realizing broadband and highly sensitive room&#8208;temperature MWIR photodetectors.

         <title>Approaching the External Quantum Efficiency Limit in 2D Photovoltaic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal strategy for constructing 2D photovoltaic devices with high performances is demonstrated. The device based on 2D WS2 exhibits nearly ideal external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 92% and high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.0%, which are attributed to the defect&#8208;free interface and recombination&#8208;free channel. The nearly ideal EQE provides great potential for PCE approaching the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit.








Abstract
2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising candidates for realizing ultrathin and high&#8208;performance photovoltaic devices. However, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of most 2D photovoltaic devices face great challenges in exceeding 50% and 3%, respectively, due to the low efficiency of photocarrier separation and collection. Here, this study demonstrates photovoltaic devices with defect&#8208;free interface and recombination&#8208;free channel based on 2D WS2, showing high EQE of 92% approaching the theoretical limit and high PCE of 5.0%. The high performances are attributed to the van der Waals metal contact without interface defects and Fermi&#8208;level pinning, and the fully depleted channel without photocarrier recombination, leading to intrinsic photocarrier separation and collection with high efficiency. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that the strategy can be extended to other TMDs such as MoSe2 and WSe2 with EQE of 92% and 94%, respectively. This work proposes a universal strategy for building high&#8208;performance 2D photovoltaic devices. The nearly ideal EQE provides great potential for PCE approaching the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit.

         <title>Machine Learning Enhanced Simultaneous and Multimodal Sensor Based on Moist&#8208;Electric Powered Graphene Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Simultaneous multimodal monitoring can greatly perceive intricately multiple stimuli, which is important for the understanding and development of future human&#8208;machine fusion world. However, the integrated multi&#8208;sensor network with the cumbersome structure, huge power consumption, and complex preparation process has heavily restricted the practical application. Herein, a graphene oxide single&#8208;component multimodal sensor (GO&#8208;MS) is developed, which enables simultaneous monitoring of multiple environmental stimuli by a single unit with unique moist&#8208;electric self&#8208;power supply. This GO&#8208;MS can generate a sustainable moist&#8208;electric potential by spontaneously adsorbing water molecules in air, which has the characteristic response behavior when exposed to different stimuli. As a result, the simultaneous monitoring and decoupling of the changes of temperature, humidity, pressure, and light intensity has been achieved by this single GO&#8208;MS with machine learning (ML) assistance. Of practical importance, the moist&#8208;electric&#8208;powered human&#8208;machine interaction wristband based on GO&#8208;MS is constructed to monitor pulse signals, body temperature and sweating in a multidimensional manner, as well as the gestures and sign language commands communication. This ML empowered moist&#8208;electric GO&#8208;MS provides a new platform for the development of continuously self&#8208;powered single&#8208;component multimodal sensors, showing great potential for applications in fields of health detection, artificial electronic skin, and many other Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Interfacial Design of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Highly Efficient and Selective Electrocatalysis of CO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks enable the integration of electron&#8208;conduction and mass&#8208;transport interfaces via one&#8208;pot polycondensation reaction into well&#8208;defined catalytic skeletons, so that the ordered &#960; skeletons promote electron motion and the hydrophobic channels facilitate CO2 delivery to the catalytic centers. The systematic interface design boosts catalytic activity and selectivity to achieve a benchmark electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.








Abstract
Assembling molecular catalytic centers into crosslinked networks is widely used to fabricate heterogeneous catalysts but they often suffer loss in activity and selectivity accompanied by unclear causes. Here, a strategy for the construction of heterogeneous catalysts to induce activity and selectivity by bottom&#8208;up introduction of segregated electron&#8208;conduction and mass&#8208;transport interfaces into the catalytic materials is reported. The catalytic skeletons are designed to possess different &#960; orderings for electron motion and the open channels are tailored to install finely engineered walls for mass transport, so that origins of activity and selectivity are correlated. The resultant covalent organic framework catalysts with ordered &#960; skeletons and solvophobic pores increase activity by two orders of magnitude, enhance selectivity and energy efficiency by 70&#8208;fold, and broaden the voltage range, to promote CO2 transformation under ambient conditions.

     alt="Bottom-Up Interfacial Design of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Highly Efficient and Selective Electrocatalysis of CO2"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic frameworks enable the integration of electron-conduction and mass-transport interfaces via one-pot polycondensation reaction into well-defined catalytic skeletons, so that the ordered &#960; skeletons promote electron motion and the hydrophobic channels facilitate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; delivery to the catalytic centers. The systematic interface design boosts catalytic activity and selectivity to achieve a benchmark electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assembling molecular catalytic centers into crosslinked networks is widely used to fabricate heterogeneous catalysts but they often suffer loss in activity and selectivity accompanied by unclear causes. Here, a strategy for the construction of heterogeneous catalysts to induce activity and selectivity by bottom-up introduction of segregated electron-conduction and mass-transport interfaces into the catalytic materials is reported. The catalytic skeletons are designed to possess different &#960; orderings for electron motion and the open channels are tailored to install finely engineered walls for mass transport, so that origins of activity and selectivity are correlated. The resultant covalent organic framework catalysts with ordered &#960; skeletons and solvophobic pores increase activity by two orders of magnitude, enhance selectivity and energy efficiency by 70-fold, and broaden the voltage range, to promote CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; transformation under ambient conditions. The results open a way to precise interfacial design of actionable heterogeneous catalysts for producing feedstocks from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Co&#8208;Modification of Halide Anions and Potassium Cations Promotes High&#8208;Rate CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Ethanol Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface fluorine&#8208;bonded, single potassium&#8208;atom&#8208;modified Cu(111) nanocrystal (K&#8211;F&#8211;Cu&#8211;CO2) is prepared by in situ electrochemical reconstruction of KCuF3 perovskite. The K&#8211;F&#8211;Cu&#8211;CO2 electrocatalyst exhibits a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol partial current density of 423 &#177; 30 mA cm&#8722;2 with corresponding Faradaic efficiency of 52.9 &#177; 3.7%, and a high electrochemical stability at large current densities.








Abstract
The high&#8208;rate electrochemical CO2 conversion to ethanol with high partial current density is attractive but challenging, which requires competing with other reduction products as well as hydrogen evolution. This work demonstrates the in situ reconstruction of KCuF3 perovskite under CO2 electroreduction conditions to fabricate a surface fluorine&#8208;bonded, single&#8208;potassium&#8208;atom&#8208;modified Cu(111) nanocrystal (K&#8211;F&#8211;Cu&#8211;CO2). Density functional theory calculations reveal that the co&#8208;modification of both F and K atoms on the Cu(111) surface can promote the ethanol pathway via stabilization of the C&#63743;O bond and selective hydrogenation of the C&#63742;C bond in the CH2&#63742;CHO* intermediate, while the single modification of either F or K is less effective. The K&#8211;F&#8211;Cu&#8211;CO2 electrocatalyst exhibits an outstanding CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol partial current density of 423 &#177; 30 mA cm&#8722;2 with the corresponding Faradaic efficiency of 52.9 &#177; 3.7%, and a high electrochemical stability at large current densities, thus suggesting an attractive means of surface co&#8208;modification of halide anions and alkali&#8208;metal cations on Cu catalysts for high&#8208;rate CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol electrosynthesis.

         <title>Molecularly Engineered Protein Glues with Superior Adhesion Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Naturally inspired proteins have been investigated for the development of bioglues that combine adhesion performance and biocompatibility for biomedical applications. However, engineering such adhesives by rational design of the proteins at the molecular level is rarely reported. Herein, we show that a new generation of protein&#8208;based glues is generated by supramolecular assembly through de novo designed structural proteins in which the arginine triggers robust liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation. The encoded arginine moieties significantly strengthened multiple molecular interactions in the complex, leading to ultra&#8208;strong adhesion on various surfaces, outperforming many chemically reacted and biomimetic glues. Such adhesive materials enabled quick visceral hemostasis in 10 seconds and outstanding tissue regeneration due to their robust adhesion, good biocompatibility, and superior anti&#8208;bacterial capacity. Remarkably, their minimum inhibitory concentrations are orders of magnitude lower than clinical antibiotics. These advances offer insights into molecular engineering of de novo designed protein glues and outline a general strategy to fabricate mechanically strong protein&#8208;based materials for surgical applications.

         <title>Advanced Non&#8208;Flammable Organic Electrolyte Promises Safer Li Metal Batteries: From Solvation Structure Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Batteries with Li metal anode have recently attracted extensive attention from battery communities owing to their high energy density. However, severe dendrite growth hinders their practical applications. More seriously, when Li dendrites pierce the separators and trigger short circuit in a highly flammable organic electrolyte, the results would be catastrophe. Although the issues of Li dendrites growth have been almost addressed by various methods, the highly flammable nature of conventional organic liquid electrolyte is still a lingering fear facing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries given the possibility of thermal runaway of high&#8208;voltage cathode. Recently, various kinds of non&#8208;flammable liquid or solid&#8208;state electrolytes have shown great potential towards safer Li metal batteries with minimal detrimental effect on the battery performance or even enhanced electrochemical performance. In this Review, we summarizes recent advances in developing non&#8208;flammable electrolyte for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries including high&#8208;concentration electrolyte, localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte, fluorinated electrolyte, ionic liquid electrolyte, and polymer electrolyte. Then, we analyze the solvation structure of different kinds of non&#8208;flammable liquid and polymer electrolytes to provide insight into the mechanism for dendrite suppression and fire extinguishing. Finally, we provide guideline for future design of non&#8208;flammable electrolyte for safer Li metal batteries.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Based Coacervate&#8208;Core Vesicles with Semipermeable Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 34, August 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coacervate droplets are promising protocell candidates. However, these droplets lack a membrane and are prone to coalescence, limiting their survival and ability to interact. This work shows that short tyrosine&#8208;rich peptide conjugates can undergo liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation and subsequently transform into stable membrane&#8208;enclosed protocells by enzymatic oxidation. The coacervate&#8208;core vesicles are semipermeable and can host enzymatic reactions.








Abstract
Coacervates droplets have long been considered as potential protocells to mimic living cells. However, these droplets lack a membrane and are prone to coalescence, limiting their ability to survive, interact, and organize into higher&#8208;order assemblies. This work shows that tyrosine&#8208;rich peptide conjugates can undergo liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation in a well&#8208;defined pH window and transform into stable membrane&#8208;enclosed protocells by enzymatic oxidation and cross&#8208;linking at the liquid&#8211;liquid interface. The oxidation of the tyrosine&#8208;rich peptides into dityrosine creates a semipermeable, flexible membrane around the coacervates with tunable thickness, which displays strong intrinsic fluorescence, and stabilizes the coacervate protocells against coalescence. The membranes have an effective molecular weight cut&#8208;off of 2.5&#160;kDa, as determined from the partitioning of small dyes and labeled peptides, RNA, and polymers into the membrane&#8208;enclosed coacervate protocells. Flicker spectroscopy reveals a membrane bending rigidity of only 0.1kBT, which is substantially lower than phospholipid bilayers despite a larger membrane thickness. Finally, it is shown that enzymes can be stably encapsulated inside the protocells and be supplied with substrates from outside, which opens the way for these membrane&#8208;bound compartments to be used as molecularly crowded artificial cells capable of communication or as a vehicle for drug delivery.

A collection of machine&#8208;learning techniques is utilized to effectively discover the hidden pattern between Raman&#8208; and PL&#8208;spectra of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), which provide insights into the physical mechanisms connecting PL and Raman features. This study's analysis further disentangles the strain and doping contributions from the Raman spectra through machine&#8208;learning models.








Abstract
2D&#160;transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) with intense and tunable photoluminescence (PL) have opened up new opportunities for optoelectronic and photonic applications such as light&#8208;emitting diodes, photodetectors, and single&#8208;photon emitters. Among the standard characterization tools for 2D materials, Raman spectroscopy stands out as a fast and non&#8208;destructive technique capable of probing material's&#160;crystallinity and perturbations such as doping and strain. However, a comprehensive understanding of the correlation between photoluminescence and Raman spectra in monolayer&#160;MoS2 remains elusive due to its highly nonlinear nature. Here, the connections between PL signatures and Raman modes are systematically explored, providing comprehensive insights into the physical mechanisms correlating PL and Raman features. This study's analysis further disentangles the strain and doping contributions from the Raman spectra through machine&#8208;learning models. First, a dense convolutional network (DenseNet)&#160;to predict PL maps by spatial Raman maps is deployed. Moreover, a gradient boosted trees model (XGBoost) with Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) to bridge the impact of individual Raman features in PL features is applied. Last, a support vector machine (SVM) to project PL features on Raman frequencies is adopted. This work may serve as a methodology for applying machine learning to characterizations of 2D materials.

         <title>Magnetic Microswarm and Fluoroscopy&#8208;Guided Platform for Biofilm Eradication in Biliary Stents</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 34, August 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proposed magnetic microswarm, consisting of urchin&#8208;like MUCR@MLMD, with controlled motility on a curved surface, restricted space accessibility, and swarm enhancement effects is expected to be of great value in treating bacterial biofilm infections associated with medical implants in situ. Moreover, a fluoroscopy&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided microswarm with rapid endoscopic delivery is demonstrated for biofilm eradication deep inside the body with high time efficiency.








Abstract
Biofilm eradication from medical implants is of fundamental importance, and the treatment of biofilm&#8208;associated pathogen infections on inaccessible biliary stents remains challenging. Magnetically driven microrobots with controlled motility, accessibility to the tiny lumen, and swarm enhancement effects can physically disrupt the deleterious biostructures while not developing drug resistance. Magnetic urchin&#8208;like capsule robots (MUCRs) loaded with magnetic liquid metal droplets (MLMDs, antibacterial agents) are designed using natural sunflower pollen, and the therapeutic effect of swarming MUCR@MLMDs is explored for eradicating complex mixtures of bacterial biofilm within biliary stents collected from patients. The external magnetic field triggers the emergence of the microswarm and induces MLMDs to transform their shape into spheroids and rods with sharp edges. The inherent natural microspikes of MUCRs and the obtained sharp edges of MLMDs actively rupture the dense biological matrix and multiple species of embedded bacterial cells by exerting mechanical force, finally achieving synergistic biofilm eradication. The microswarm is precisely and rapidly deployed into the biliary stent via endoscopy in 10 min. Notably, fluoroscopy imaging is used to track and navigate the locomotion of microswarm in biliary stents in real&#8208;time. The microswarm has great potential for treating bacterial biofilm infections associated with medical&#160;implants.

         <title>Tunable Strong Coupling in Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Nanowires</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 34, August 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemically synthesized transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) nanowires are exploited as a new type of subwavelength optical nanoresonators to simultaneously support pronounced excitonic and Mie resonances. Strong coupling between excitons and Mie resonances is demonstrated to support Mie&#8208;exciton polaritons. Moreover, the optical coupling can be further tuned by optothermal effects in a reversible and reproducible way.








Abstract
Subwavelength optical resonators with spatiotemporal control of light are essential to the miniaturization of optical devices. In this work, chemically synthesized transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) nanowires are exploited as a new type of dielectric nanoresonators to simultaneously support pronounced excitonic and Mie resonances. Strong light&#8211;matter couplings and tunable exciton polaritons in individual nanowires are demonstrated. In addition, the excitonic responses can be reversibly modulated with excellent reproducibility, offering the potential for developing tunable optical nanodevices. Being in the mobile colloidal state with highly tunable optical properties, the TMDC nanoresonators will find promising applications in integrated active optical devices, including all&#8208;optical switches and sensors.

         <title>All&#8208;van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals Barrier&#8208;Free Contacts for High&#8208;Mobility Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 34, August 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals (vdW) barrier&#8208;free metal&#8211;semiconductor contact is realized by using vdW semimetals to replace conventional metals, which can avoid the pinning effect of the Fermi levels and surface dangling bonds of conventional metal electrodes. Such a strategy can effectively reduce the contact resistance and enable record&#8208;setting performance metrics of 2D semiconductor transistors.








Abstract
Ultrathin 2D semiconductor devices are considered to have beyond&#8208;silicon potential but are severely troubled by the high Schottky barriers of the metal&#8211;semiconductor contacts, especially for p&#8208;type semiconductors. Due to the severe Fermi&#8208;level pinning effect and the lack of conventional semimetals with high work functions, their Schottky hole barriers are hardly removed. Here, an all&#8208;van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals barrier&#8208;free hole contact between p&#8208;type tellurene semiconductor and layered 1T&#8242;&#8208;WS2 semimetal is reported, which achieves a zero Schottky barrier height of 3 &#177; 9&#160;meV and a high field&#8208;effect mobility of &#8776;1304 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1. The formation of such contacts can be attributed to the higher work function of &#8776;4.95&#160;eV of the 1T&#8242;&#8208;WS2 semimetal, which is in sharp contrast with low work function (4.1&#8211;4.7&#160;eV) of conventional semimetals. The study defines an available strategy for eliminating the Schottky barrier of metal&#8211;semiconductor contacts, facilitating 2D&#8208;semiconductor&#8208;based electronics and optoelectronics to extend Moore's law.

         <title>Asymmetric Co&#63743;N3P1 Trifunctional Catalyst with Tailored Electronic Structures Enabling Boosted Activities and Corrosion Resistance in an Uninterrupted Seawater Splitting System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 34, August 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric Co&#63743;N3P1 with a harmonized electronic structure can achieve strong O&#8208;binding ability, moderate H adsorption, and weak Cl&#8722;&#8208;binding ability, which helps to repel Cl&#8722; anions for enhanced corrosion resistance and optimization of the trifunctional ORR/OER/HER performance simultaneously, displaying promising potential for application in an uninterrupted seawater splitting system.








Abstract
Employing seawater splitting systems to generate hydrogen can be economically advantageous but still remains challenging, particularly for designing efficient and high Cl&#8722;&#8208;corrosion resistant trifunctional catalysts toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, single Co&#63743;N&#63743;C catalysts with well&#8208;defined symmetric Co&#63743;N4 sites are selected as atomic platforms for electronic structure tailoring. Density function theory reveals that P&#8208;doping into Co&#63743;N&#63743;C can lead to the formation of asymmetric Co&#63743;N3P1 sites with symmetry&#8208;breaking electronic structures, enabling the affinity of strong oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates, moderate H adsorption, and weak Cl&#8722; adsorption. Thus, ORR/OER/HER activities and stability are optimized simultaneously with high Cl&#8722;&#8208;corrosion resistance. The asymmetric Co&#63743;N3P1 structure based catalyst with boosted ORR/OER/HER performance endows seawater&#8208;based Zn&#8211;air batteries (S&#8208;ZABs) with superior long&#8208;term stability over 750 h and allows seawater splitting to operate continuously for 1000 h. A self&#8208;driven seawater splitting powered by S&#8208;ZABs gives ultrahigh H2 production rates of 497&#160;&#956;mol h&#8722;1. This work is the first to advance the scientific understanding of the competitive adsorption mechanism between Cl&#8722; and reaction intermediates from the perspective of electronic structure, paving the way for synthesis of efficient trifunctional catalysts with high Cl&#8722;&#8208;corrosion resistance.

&lt;p&gt;Employing seawater splitting systems to generate hydrogen can be economically advantageous but still remains challenging, particularly for designing efficient and high Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-corrosion resistant trifunctional catalysts toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, single Co&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;C catalysts with well-defined symmetric Co&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sites are selected as atomic platforms for electronic structure tailoring. Density function theory reveals that P-doping into Co&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;C can lead to the formation of asymmetric Co&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; sites with symmetry-breaking electronic structures, enabling the affinity of strong oxygen-containing intermediates, moderate H adsorption, and weak Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; adsorption. Thus, ORR/OER/HER activities and stability are optimized simultaneously with high Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-corrosion resistance. The asymmetric Co&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; structure based catalyst with boosted ORR/OER/HER performance endows seawater-based Zn&#8211;air batteries (S-ZABs) with superior long-term stability over 750 h and allows seawater splitting to operate continuously for 1000 h. A self-driven seawater splitting powered by S-ZABs gives ultrahigh H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rates of 497&#160;&#956;mol h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This work is the first to advance the scientific understanding of the competitive adsorption mechanism between Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and reaction intermediates from the perspective of electronic structure, paving the way for synthesis of efficient trifunctional catalysts with high Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-corrosion resistance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Complement&#8208;Opsonized NIR&#8208;IIb Emissive Immunotracers for Dynamically Monitoring Neutrophils in Inflammation&#8208;Related Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 34, August 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complement C3 opsonized near&#8208;infrared&#8208;IIb emissive immunotracers are captured by inflammation&#8208;stimulated neutrophils in circulatory blood through complement&#8208;receptors&#8208;mediated phagocytosis, enabling dynamically monitoring neutrophils during cutaneous wound healing and cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. The strategy of modulating surface chemistry of nanosized imaging agents to enhance complement C3 opsonization provides a new insight to develop immunotracers for in vivo labeling and tracking neutrophils.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time monitoring of neutrophil dynamics is crucial for timely diagnosis and effective treatment of inflammation&#8208;related diseases, which requires a reliable tracer for in vivo tracking of neutrophils. However, immunotracers for neutrophils are extremely limited because of the difficulty in labeling the cells. Inspired by the natural biological function of the complement system, a strategy of enhancing the complement C3 opsonization of lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles (LnNPs) by modulating their surface chemistry, thus developing a near infrared&#8208;IIb emissive nanotracer for neutrophils, is reported herein. Four kinds of surface&#8208;modified LnNPs are fabricated, among which phospholipids DOPG&#8208;modified LnNPs (LnNPs@PG) with weak antifouling ability and hydroxyl groups adsorb more complement C3 proteins and form covalent linkages with C3b active fragments under inflammation conditions, inducing enhanced complement C3 opsonization. Therefore, LnNPs@PG with enhanced complement C3 opsonization are capable of efficiently labeling inflammation&#8208;stimulated neutrophils in vivo through complement&#8208;receptors&#8208;mediated phagocytosis and achieve dynamic monitoring neutrophils during cutaneous wound healing and cerebral ischemia/reperfusion.

         <title>Efficient Low&#8208;Grade Heat Conversion and Storage with an Activity&#8208;Regulated Redox Flow Cell via a Thermally Regenerative Electrochemical Cycle</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 34, August 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational regulation on the activities of redox couples at different temperatures has been demonstrated as an effective method to boost thermoelectric conversion in thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle (TREC) systems. This TREC system operates on a pair of reversible electrochemical reactions accompanying thermally&#8208;induced phase transitions during charging and discharging, which significantly boosts the thermoelectric performance of a TREC system.








Abstract
Efficient and cost&#8208;effective technologies are highly desired to convert the tremendous amount of low&#8208;grade waste heat to electricity. Although the thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle (TREC) has attracted increasing attention recently, the unsatisfactory thermal&#8208;to&#8208;electrical conversion efficiency and low power density limit its practical applications. In this work, a thermosensitive Nernstian&#8208;potential&#8208;driven strategy in the TREC system is demonstrated to boost its temperature coefficient, power density, and thermoelectric conversion efficiency by rationally regulating the activities of redox couples at different temperatures. With a Zn anode and [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;/3&#8722;&#8208;guanidinium as the catholyte, the TREC flow cell presents an unprecedented average temperature coefficient of &#8722;3.28&#160;mV K&#8722;1, and achieves an absolute thermoelectric efficiency of 25.1% and apparent thermoelectric efficiency of 14.9% relative to the Carnot efficiency in the temperature range of 25&#8211;50&#160;&#176;C at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. In addition, a thermoelectric power density of 1.98&#160;mW m&#8722;2 K&#8722;2 is demonstrated, which is more than 7 times the highest power density of reported TREC systems. This activity regulation strategy can inspire research into high&#8208;efficiency and high&#8208;power TREC devices for practical low&#8208;grade heat harnessing.

         <title>A 2D Ultrathin Nanopatterned Interlayer to Suppress Lithium Dendrite Growth in High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 34, August 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin (&lt;1 &#181;m) multilayered protective (composed of lithiophilic seeds, 2D blocking layer, and vertically porous membrane) is strategically designed for tackling the chronic issue of dendritic growth of lithium (Li). The synergetic interactions between the layers enhance mechanical robustness and facilitate fast and homogenized Li&#8208;ion flux, which result in smooth and stabilized Li growth and outstanding cycling stability.








Abstract
A novel strategy for robust and ultrathin (&lt;1 &#181;m) multilayered protective structures to address uncontrolled Lithium (Li) dendrite growth at Li&#8208;metal battery anodes is reported. Synergetic interaction among Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs), reduced graphene oxide (rGO) films, and self&#8208;assembled block&#8208;copolymer (BCP) layers enables effective suppression of dendritic Li growth. While Ag NP layer confines the growth of Li metal underneath the rGO layer, BCP layer facilitates the fast and uniformly distributed flux of Li&#8208;ion transport and mechanically supports the rGO layer. Notably, highly aligned nanochannels with &#8776;15&#160;nm diameter and &#8776;600&#160;nm length scale interpenetrating within the BCP layer offer reversible well&#8208;defined pathways for Li&#8208;ion transport. Dramatic stress relaxation with the multilayered structure is confirmed via structural simulation considering the mechanical stress induced by filamentary&#8208;growth of Li metal. Li&#8208;metal anodes modified with the protective layer well&#8208;maintain stable reaction interfaces with limited solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase formation, yielding outstanding cycling stability and enhanced rate capability, as demonstrated by the full&#8208;cells paired with high&#8208;loading of LiFePO4 cathodes. The idealized design of multilayer protective layer provides significant insight for advanced Li&#8208;metal anodes.

         <title>All&#8208;Printed Ultrahigh&#8208;Responsivity MoS2 Nanosheet Photodetectors Enabled by Megasonic Exfoliation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 34, August 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully aerosol&#8208;jet printed (AJP) photodetectors are fabricated using megasonically exfoliated MoS2 channels and graphene electrodes. Superlative optoelectronic performance is attributed to the megasonically thinned MoS2 nanosheets, resulting in responsivities that exceed previous all&#8208;printed visible photodetectors by over three orders of magnitude.








Abstract
Printed 2D&#160;materials, derived from solution&#8208;processed inks, offer scalable and cost&#8208;effective routes to mechanically flexible optoelectronics. With micrometer&#8208;scale control and broad processing latitude, aerosol&#8208;jet printing (AJP) is of particular interest for all&#8208;printed circuits and systems. Here, AJP is utilized to achieve ultrahigh&#8208;responsivity photodetectors consisting of well&#8208;aligned, percolating networks of semiconducting MoS2 nanosheets and graphene electrodes on flexible polyimide substrates. Ultrathin (&#8776;1.2&#160;nm thick) and high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio (&#8776;1&#160;&#956;m lateral size) MoS2 nanosheets are obtained by electrochemical intercalation followed by megasonic atomization during AJP, which not only aerosolizes the inks but also further exfoliates the nanosheets. The incorporation of the high&#8208;boiling&#8208;point solvent terpineol into the MoS2 ink is critical for achieving a highly aligned and flat thin&#8208;film morphology following AJP as confirmed by grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and atomic force microscopy. Following AJP, curing is achieved with photonic annealing, which yields quasi&#8208;ohmic contacts and photoactive channels with responsivities exceeding 103&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 that outperform previously reported all&#8208;printed visible&#8208;light photodetectors by over three orders of magnitude. Megasonic exfoliation coupled with properly designed AJP ink formulations enables the superlative optoelectronic properties of ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets to be preserved and exploited for the scalable additive manufacturing of mechanically flexible optoelectronics.

Ultrathin (&#8776;1.2&#160;nm thick) and high-aspect-ratio (&#8776;1&#160;&#956;m lateral size) MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets are obtained by electrochemical intercalation followed by megasonic atomization during AJP, which not only aerosolizes the inks but also further exfoliates the nanosheets. The incorporation of the high-boiling-point solvent terpineol into the MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ink is critical for achieving a highly aligned and flat thin-film morphology following AJP as confirmed by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering and atomic force microscopy. Following AJP, curing is achieved with photonic annealing, which yields quasi-ohmic contacts and photoactive channels with responsivities exceeding 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;A&#160;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; that outperform previously reported all-printed visible-light photodetectors by over three orders of magnitude. Megasonic exfoliation coupled with properly designed AJP ink formulations enables the superlative optoelectronic properties of ultrathin MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets to be preserved and exploited for the scalable additive manufacturing of mechanically flexible optoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Transformation Enables a Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc&#8208;Metal Anode in Nonaqueous Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 34, August 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly reversible and dendrite&#8208;free Zn&#8208;metal anode is achieved by the surface transformation of Cu substrate in a nonaqueous electrolyte. Meanwhile, the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth mechanism and edge&#8208;to&#8208;center stripping behavior during the plating and stripping processes is revealed by in situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy (EC&#8208;AFM).








Abstract
Significant challenges remain in developing rechargeable zinc batteries mainly because of reversibility problems on zinc&#8208;metal anodes. The dendritic growth and hydrogen evolution on zinc electrodes are major obstacles to overcome in developing practical and safe zinc batteries. Here, a dendrite&#8208;free and hydrogen&#8208;free Zn&#8208;metal anode with high Coulombic efficiency up to 99.6% over 300 cycles is realized in a newly designed nonaqueous electrolyte, which comprises an inexpensive zinc salt, zinc acetate, and a green low&#8208;cost solvent, dimethyl sulfoxide. Surface transformation on Cu substrate plays a critical role in facilitating the dendrite&#8208;free deposition process, which lowers the diffusion energy barrier of the Zn atoms, leading to a uniform and compact thin film for zinc plating. Furthermore, in situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy reveals the plating process via a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth mechanism and the stripping process through an edge&#8208;dissolution mechanism. In addition, Zn||Mo6S8 full cells exhibit excellent electrochemical performance in terms of cycling stability and rate capability. This work presents a new opportunity to develop nonaqueous rechargeable zinc batteries.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Liquid Crystalline Polymer for Intrinsic Fire&#8208;Resistant and Flexible Triboelectric Nanogenerators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 34, August 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly rigid main chain of liquid crystalline poly(aryl ether ester) (LCPAEE) endows triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) with outstanding anti&#8208;dripping, temperature&#8208; and fire&#8208;resistance, and the electrical output performance remains over 65% even after combustion for 16 s above 520&#160;&#176;C, which goes beyond any previous work on flame&#8208;retardant TENGs.








Abstract
Flammability is a great challenge in the fields of electronics. The emergence of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) provides a safe way to harvest environmentalally friendly energy and convert it into more secure power sources. Especially, polymer&#8208;based TENGs significantly accelerate the practical application of self&#8208;powered flexible electronics. However, most of the existing polymeric materials for TENGs are easily flammable and melt, dripping, in a fire scenario, and cannot be reused after combustion, which greatly limits the application of TENGs under extreme conditions. Herein, a fire&#8208;resistant TENG based on all&#8208;aromatic liquid crystalline poly(aryl ether ester) (LCPAEE) synthesized via simple and efficient one&#8208;pot melt polycondensation is reported. The highly rigid main chain of LCPAEE endows the LCP&#8208;TENG with outstanding anti&#8208;dripping, temperature&#8208; and fire&#8208;resistance. The resultant LCP&#8208;TENG exhibits excellent electrical output performance, which is attributed to the high dielectric constant (&#949;&#8242;&#160;= 4.8) and fibrous&#8208;structured morphology of LCPAEE. The device can maintain over 65% of open&#8208;circuit voltage even after 16 s combustion (&#8776;520&#160;&#176;C). Consequently, this work offers a novel strategy for tailoring the TENGs toward a secure power generator and electronics with fire hazard reduction, and potential application in firefighting, personal protection, and other extreme temperature environments.

         <title>Tuning the Magnetization of Manganese (II) Carbonate by Intracrystalline Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 34, August 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bioinspired strategy of intracrystalline amino acids incorporation can be utilized to tune the magnetic properties of a crystalline host whereby both the magnetic susceptibility and N&#233;el temperature of MnCO3 change due to the incorporation of aspartic acid. These changes are attributed to the weakening of the Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction, which results from the incorporation&#8208;induced lattice expansion.








Abstract
Incorporation of organic molecules into the lattice of inorganic crystalline hosts is a common phenomenon in biomineralization and is shown to alter various properties of the crystalline host. Taking this phenomenon as a source of inspiration, it is shown herein that incorporation of specific single amino acids into the lattice of manganese (II) carbonate strongly alters its inherent magnetic properties. At room temperature, the magnetic susceptibility of the amino&#8208;acid&#8208;incorporating paramagnetic MnCO3 decreases, following a simple rule of mixtures. When cooled below the N&#233;el temperature, however, the opposite trend is observed, namely an increase in magnetic susceptibility measured in a high magnetic field. Such an increase, accompanied by a drastic change in the N&#233;el phase transformation temperature, results from a decrease in MnCO3 orbital overlapping and the weakening of superexchange interactions. It may be that this is the first time that the magnetic properties of a host crystal are tuned via the incorporation of amino acids.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Magnon&#8208;Mediated Magnetization Switching in All&#8208;Oxide Heterostructures with Perpendicular Magnetic Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 34, August 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magnon current excited in an insulating antiferromagnetic layer by an electronic spin current in an epitaxial all&#8208;oxide heterostructure is demonstrated to be effective for manipulating the perpendicular magnetization in a ferromagnetic layer. Furthermore, the critical current density to switch the magnetization is about one order of magnitude smaller than in conventional metallic systems.








Abstract
The search for efficient approaches to realize local switching of magnetic moments in spintronic devices has attracted extensive attention. One of the most promising approaches is the electrical manipulation of magnetization through electron&#8208;mediated spin torque. However, the Joule heat generated via electron motion unavoidably causes substantial energy dissipation and potential damage to spintronic devices. Here, all&#8208;oxide heterostructures of SrRuO3/NiO/SrIrO3 are epitaxially grown on SrTiO3 single&#8208;crystal substrates following the order of the ferromagnetic transition metal oxide SrRuO3 with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, insulating and antiferromagnetic NiO, and metallic transition metal oxide SrIrO3 with strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling. It is demonstrated that instead of the electron spin torques, the magnon torques present in the antiferromagnetic NiO layer can directly manipulate the perpendicular magnetization of the ferromagnetic layer. This magnon mechanism may significantly reduce the electron motion&#8208;related energy dissipation from electron&#8208;mediated spin currents. Interestingly, the threshold current density to generate a sufficient magnon current to manipulate the magnetization is one order of magnitude smaller than that in conventional metallic systems. These findings suggest a route for developing highly efficient all&#8208;oxide spintronic devices operated by magnon current.

         <title>Anhydrous Fast Proton Transport Boosted by the Hydrogen Bond Network in a Dense Oxide&#8208;Ion Array of &#945;&#8208;MoO3</title>

         <dc:description>
The kinetic property of inserted charge carriers in a battery electrode dominates the power density of the system. In this work, the fast proton&#8208;transfer mechanism in the unique dense framework of &#945;&#8208;MoO3 is decoded. The hydrogen bond network boosts the proton transport and thus realizes a proton battery with high rate capabilities and long life.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;power battery chemistry is an urgent task to buffer fluctuating renewable energies and achieve a sustainable and flexible power supply. Owing to the small size of the proton and its ultrahigh mobility in water via the Grotthuss mechanism, aqueous proton batteries are an attractive candidate for high&#8208;power energy storage devices. Grotthuss proton transfer is ultrafast owing to the hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks of water molecules. In this work, similar continuous hydrogen bond networks in a dense oxide&#8208;ion array of solid &#945;&#8208;MoO3 are discovered, which facilitate the anhydrous proton transport even without structural water. The fast proton transfer and accumulation that occurs during (de)intercalation in &#945;&#8208;MoO3 is unveiled using both experiments and first&#8208;principles calculations. Coupled with a zinc anode and a superconcentrated Zn2+/H+ electrolyte, the proton&#8208;transport mechanism in anhydrous hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks realizes an aqueous MoO3&#8211;Zn battery with large capacity, long life, and fast charge&#8211;discharge abilities.

         <title>A Seawater&#8208;Corrosion&#8208;Resistant and Isotropic Zero Thermal Expansion (Zr,Ta)(Fe,Co)2 Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 34, August 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nowadays, zero thermal expansion (ZTE) alloys are challenged by other environmental instabilities beyond the dimensional stability. Here, a ZTE alloy, Zr0.8Ta0.2Fe1.7Co0.3, is studied, which shows multiple stabilities, including dimensional stability (ZTE, &#945;l&#160;= 0.21(&#177;2) &#215; 10&#8722;6 K&#8722;1 from 5 to 360 K), shape stability (isotropic), cycling stability, and environmental stability.








Abstract
Zero thermal expansion (ZTE) alloys as dimensionally stable materials are usually challenged by harsh environmental erosion, since ZTE and corrosion resistance are generally mutually exclusive. Here, a high&#8208;performance alloy, Zr0.8Ta0.2Fe1.7Co0.3, is reported, that shows isotropic ZTE behavior (&#945;l&#160;= 0.21(2) &#215; 10&#8722;6 K&#8722;1) in a wide temperature range of 5&#8211;360 K, high corrosion resistance in a seawater&#8208;like solution compared with classic Invar and stainless Invar, and excellent cyclic thermal and structural stabilities. Such stabilities are attributed to the cubic symmetry, the controllable magnetic order, and the spontaneously formed passive film with Ta and Zr chemical modifications. The results are evidenced by X&#8208;ray/neutron diffraction, microscopy, spectroscopy, and electrochemistry investigations. Such multiple stabilities have the potential to broaden the robust applications of ZTE alloys, especially in marine services.

         <title>Lasing Action from Quasi&#8208;Propagating Modes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 34, August 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D plasmonic nanoparticle lattices integrated with perovskite nanocrystal gain can support quasi&#8208;propagating modes that lase over a continuous range of wavelengths and angles simultaneously. Quasi&#8208;propagating modes consist of uniaxially&#8208;confined standing waves that propagate along high symmetry directions of the lattice. Lasing via quasi&#8208;propagating modes is now generalizable, with characteristics determined by different gain bandwidths and lattice periodicities and geometries.








Abstract
Band edges at the high symmetry points in reciprocal space of periodic structures hold special interest in materials engineering for their high density of states. In optical metamaterials, standing waves found at these points have facilitated lasing, bound&#8208;states&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;continuum, and Bose&#8211;Einstein condensation. However, because high symmetry points by definition are localized, properties associated with them are limited to specific energies and wavevectors. Conversely, quasi&#8208;propagating modes along the high symmetry directions are predicted to enable similar phenomena over a continuum of energies and wavevectors. Here, quasi&#8208;propagating modes in 2D nanoparticle lattices are shown to support lasing action over a continuous range of wavelengths and symmetry&#8208;determined directions from a single device. Using lead halide perovskite nanocrystal films as gain materials, lasing is achieved from waveguide&#8208;surface lattice resonance (W&#8208;SLR) modes that can be decomposed into propagating waves along high symmetry directions, and standing waves in the orthogonal direction that provide optical feedback. The characteristics of the lasing beams are analyzed using an analytical 3D model that describes diffracted light in 2D lattices. Demonstrations of lasing across different wavelengths and lattice designs highlight how quasi&#8208;propagating modes offer possibilities to engineer chromatic multibeam emission important in hyperspectral 3D sensing, high&#8208;bandwidth Li&#8208;Fi communication, and laser projection displays.

         <dc:description>
An ultrastable and kinetically favorable interface is constructed between sulfide&#8211;poly(ethylene oxide) composite solid electrolytes and lithium metal, via in&#160;situ formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) containing Li3PS4. This simple and effective approach of constructing a highly&#160;Li+&#8208;conductive, electronically insulating, chemically/electrochemically stable, and mechanically compatible Li3PS4/Li2S/LiF SEI can lead to small interfacial resistance and uniform lithium plating, which makes Li&#8208;metal&#8208;anode all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries possible.








Abstract
An ultrastable and kinetically favorable interface is constructed between sulfide&#8211;poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) and lithium metal, via in&#160;situ formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer containing Li3PS4. A specially&#160;designed sulfide, lithium polysulfidophosphate (LPS), can distribute uniformly in the PEO matrix via a simple stirring process because of its complete solubility in acetonitrile solvent, which is advantageous for creating a homogeneous SEI layer. The CSE/Li interface with high Li+ transportation capability is stabilized quickly through in&#160;situ formation of a Li3PS4/Li2S/LiF layer via the reaction between LPS and lithium metal to inhibit lithium dendrite growth. A Li/Li symmetric cell with the LPS&#8208;integrated CSE exhibits constant and small CSE/Li resistance of 10&#160;&#937;&#160;cm2&#160;during cycling, delivering stable cycling for 3475&#160;h at a current density of 0.2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;and a high critical current density of 0.9&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;at 60&#160;&#176;C. Impressive electrochemical performance is also demonstrated for LiFePO4/CSE/Li all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries with capacity of 127.6&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;after 1000&#160;cycles at 1&#160;C.

         <title>Vapor Lubrication for Reducing Water and Ice Adhesion on Poly(dimethylsiloxane) Brushes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 34, August 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vapor lubrication is developed to reduce the adhesion of water drops, even ice, on the surface. The results demonstrate a significantly lower limit departure drop size, and higher water harvesting efficiency. Potential applications in drop manipulation and deicing are also shown.








Abstract
Fast removal of small water drops from surfaces is a challenging issue in heat transfer, water collection, or anti&#8208;icing. Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) brushes show good prospects to reach this goal because of their low adhesion to liquids. To further reduce adhesion of water drops, here, the surface to the vapor of organic solvents such as toluene or n&#8208;hexane is exposed. In the presence of such vapors, water drops slide at lower tilt angle and move faster. This is mainly caused by the physisorption of vapor and swelling of the PDMS brushes, which serves as a lubricating layer. Enhanced by the toluene vapor lubrication, the limit departure volume of water drop on PDMS brushes decreases by one order of magnitude compared to that in air. As a result, the water harvesting efficiency in toluene vapor increases by 65%. Benefits of vapor lubrication are further demonstrated for de&#8208;icing: driven by gravity, frozen water drops slide down the vertical PDMS brush surface in the presence of vapor.

         <title>Reversible Deformation of Artificial Cell Colonies Triggered by Actin Polymerization for Muscle Behavior Mimicry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 34, August 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;powered artificial cells are developed by encapsulating mitochondria to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules, which initiate the polymerization of actin monomers to form filaments. The artificial cells are deformed by the formation of actin filaments and recovered by their depolymerization via laser irradiation. The linearly hemifused artificial cell colonies are confirmed to exhibit synchronized collective behaviors to mimic muscle tissues.








Abstract
The use of artificial cells to mimic living tissues is beneficial for understanding the mechanism of interaction among cells. Artificial cells hold immense potential in the field of tissue engineering. Self&#8208;powered artificial cells capable of reversible deformation are developed by encapsulating living mitochondria, actins, and methylcellulose. Upon addition of pyruvate molecules, the mitochondria produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which acts as an energy source to trigger actin polymerization. The reversible deformation of artificial cells occurs with a spindle shape resulting from the polymerization of actins to form filaments adjacent to the lipid bilayer that subsequently returns to a spherical shape resulting from the depolymerization of actin filaments upon laser irradiation. The linear colonies composed of these artificial cells exhibit collective contraction and relaxation to mimic muscle tissues. At maximum contraction, the long axis of each giant unilamellar vesicle (GUV) is parallel to each other. All the colonies are synchronized in the contraction phase. The deformation of each GUV in the colonies is influenced by its adjacent GUVs. The muscle&#8208;like artificial cell colonies described here pave the way to develop sustainably self&#8208;powered artificial tissues.

         <title>Poly(arylene piperidine) Quaternary Ammonium Salts Promoting Stable Long&#8208;Lived Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence in Aqueous Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 34, August 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A long&#8208;lived polymeric room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP)&#160;system is developed based on the electrostatic interaction acting between a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix and a polymer phosphor. The quaternization of the polymeric phosphors significantly enhances the RTP performance, and a&#160;bright&#8208;green phosphorescence with a lifetime of 960&#160;ms can be observed even after soaking in water&#160;for a month.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have garnered considerable research attention owing to their excellent luminescence properties and potential application prospects in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, information storage, and optoelectronics. However, several RTP systems are extremely sensitive to humidity, and consequently, the realization of long&#8208;lived RTP in water remains a formidable challenge. Herein, a feasible and effective strategy is presented to achieve long&#8208;lived polymeric RTP systems, even in an aqueous environment, through doping of synthesized polymeric phosphor PBHDB into a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix. Compared to the precursor polymer PBN and organic molecule HDBP, a more rigid polymer microenvironment and electrostatic interaction are formed between the PMMA matrix and polymer PBHDB, which effectively reduce&#160;the nonradiative decay rate of triplet excitons and dramatically increase&#160;the phosphorescence intensity. Specifically, the phosphorescence lifetime of the PBHDB@PMMA film (1258.62&#160;ms) is much longer than those of PBN@PMMA (674.20&#160;ms) and HDBP@PMMA (1.06&#160;ms). Most importantly, a bright&#8208;green afterglow can be observed after soaking the PBHDB@PMMA film in water for more than a month. The excellent water resistance and reversible response properties endow these systems with promising potential for dynamic information encryption even in water.

         <title>Tactile Near&#8208;Sensor Analogue Computing for Ultrafast Responsive Artificial Skin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 34, August 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tactile near&#8208;sensor analogue computing system that integrates a pyramidal pressure sensor array and a flexible memristor array is reported. The system can simultaneously sense and process multiple tactile stimuli without any conversion circuits. Such integration approach enables energy&#8208;efficient near&#8208;sensor analogue computing for ultrafast artificial skin applications.








Abstract
Ultrafast artificial skin enables unprecedented tactile internet applications in prosthetics, robotics, and human&#8211;machine interactions. However, current artificial skin systems that rely on front&#8208;end interface electronics typically perform redundant data transfer and analogue&#8208;to&#8208;digital conversions for decision&#8208;making, causing long latency (milliseconds). Here, a near&#8208;sensor analogue computing system based on a flexible memristor array for artificial skin applications is reported. This system, which seamlessly integrates a tactile sensor array with a flexible hafnium oxide memristor array, can simultaneously sense and compute raw multiple analogue pressure signals without interface electronics. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the system is used for real&#8208;time noise reduction and edge detection of tactile stimuli. One sensing&#8211;computing operation of this system takes about 400&#160;ns and consumes on average 1000 times less power than a conventional interface electronic system. The results demonstrate that near&#8208;sensor analogue computing offers an ultrafast and energy&#8208;efficient route to large&#8208;scale artificial skin systems.

         <title>Directed Evolution Enables Simultaneous Controlled Release of Multiple Therapeutic Proteins from Biopolymer&#8208;Based Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 34, August 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directed evolution enables the identification of distinct binding partners to multiple therapeutically&#8208;relevant proteins, thereby enabling their bioactive, independently&#8208;tunable, and simultaneous controlled release from hydrogel delivery vehicles.








Abstract
With the advent of increasingly complex combination strategies of biologics, independent control over their delivery is the key to their efficacy; however, current approaches are hindered by the limited independent tunability of their release rates. To overcome these limitations, directed evolution is used to engineer highly specific, low affinity affibody binding partners to multiple therapeutic proteins to independently control protein release rates. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, specific affibody binding partners for two proteins with broad therapeutic utility: insulin&#8208;like growth factor&#8208;1 (IGF&#8208;1) and pigment epithelium&#8208;derived factor (PEDF) are identified. Protein&#8211;affibody binding interactions specific to these target proteins with equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) between 10&#8722;7 and 10&#8722;8 m are discovered. The affibodies are covalently bound to the backbone of crosslinked hydrogels using click chemistry, enabling sustained, independent, and simultaneous release of bioactive IGF&#8208;1 and PEDF over 7 days. The system is tested with C57BL/6J mice in vivo, and the affibody&#8208;controlled release of IGF&#8208;1 results in sustained activity when compared to bolus IGF&#8208;1 delivery. This work demonstrates a new, broadly applicable approach to tune the release of therapeutic proteins simultaneously and independently and thus the way for precise control over the delivery of multicomponent therapies is paved.

         <title>Digital Light Processing 3D Printing of Tough Supramolecular Hydrogels with Sophisticated Architectures as Impact&#8208;Absorption Elements</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 34, August 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Digital Light Processing 3D printing of hydrogels with the &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; projection approach is realized by a fast gelation and toughening process with in situ formation of coordination complexes as the physical crosslinks. The high stiffness and antiswelling properties of as&#8208;printed tough supramolecular hydrogel enable high&#8208;efficiency printing to form sophisticated architectures, favoring the design of hydrogel devices with versatile applications.








Abstract
Processing tough hydrogels into sophisticated architectures is crucial for their applications as structural elements. However, Digital Light Processing (DLP) printing of tough hydrogels is challenging because of the low&#8208;speed gelation and toughening process. Described here is a simple yet versatile system suitable for DLP printing to form tough hydrogel architectures. The aqueous precursor consists of commercial photoinitiator, acrylic acid, and zirconium ion (Zr4+), readily forming tough metallo&#8208;supramolecular hydrogel under digital light because of in situ formation of carboxyl&#8211;Zr4+ coordination complexes. The high&#8208;stiffness and antiswelling properties of as&#8208;printed gel enable high&#8208;efficiency printing to form high&#8208;fidelity constructs. Furthermore, swelling&#8208;induced morphing of the gel is also achieved by encoding structure gradients during the printing with grayscale digital light. Mechanical properties of the printed hydrogels are further improved after incubation in water due to the variation of local pH and rearrangement of coordination complex. The swelling&#8208;enhanced stiffness affords the printed hydrogel with shape fixation ability after manual deformations, and thereby provides an additional avenue to form more complex configurations. These printed hydrogels are used to devise an impact&#8208;absorption element or a high&#8208;sensitivity pressure sensor as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept examples. This work should merit engineering of other tough gels and extend their scope of applications in diverse fields.

         <title>Supercritical Relaxor Nanograined Ferroelectrics for Ultrahigh&#8208;Energy&#8208;Storage Capacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 34, August 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supercritical relaxor nanograined ferroelectrics are proposed, to achieve record&#8208;high overall energy&#8208;storage properties in lead&#8208;free dielectric ceramic capacitors. Ex/in situ multiscale structure evolution coupled with the energy&#8208;storage process provides clear evidence of the supercritical behavior, as achieved by engineering the coexistence of multiple local symmetries within the ergodic relaxor zone.








Abstract
Supercritical relaxor nanograined ferroelectrics are demonstrated for high&#8208;performance dielectric capacitors, showing record&#8208;high overall properties of energy density &#8776;13.1 J cm&#8722;3 and field&#8208;insensitive efficiency &#8776;90% at &#8776;74&#160;kV mm&#8722;1 and superior charge&#8211;discharge performances of high power density &#8776;700 MW cm&#8722;3, high discharge energy density &#8776;6.67 J cm&#8722;3, and ultrashort discharge time &lt;40&#160;ns at 55&#160;kV mm&#8722;1. Ex/in situ transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction provide clear evidence of the supercritical behavior in (Na,K)(Sb,Nb)O3&#8211;SrZrO3&#8211;(Bi0.5Na0.5)ZrO3 ceramics, being achieved by engineering the coexistence of multiple local symmetries within the ergodic relaxor zone. The vanished difference between the ground relaxor state and the high&#8208;field supercritical state eliminates polarization hysteresis. The supercritical evolution with electric field enables a highly delayed polarization saturation with continuously increased polarization magnitudes. The results demonstrate that such a design strategy of compositionally induced and field&#8208;manipulated supercritical behavior can be generalizable for developing desirable energy&#8208;storage dielectrics for applications in ceramic/film capacitors.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Inspired Microenvironment Engineering of a Single&#8208;Molecular Heterojunction for Promoting Concerted Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 34, August 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;inspired single&#8208;molecular heterojunction electrocatalyst with accurate amino&#8208;rich microenvironments around the active sites is uniquely designed to enable efficient CO2 capture and fast proton ferrying during CO2 electroreduction, which achieves concurrent CO production at the cathode and sulfur recovery at the anode with industrial&#8208;level current density and lower energy consumption.








Abstract
Challenges remain in the development of novel multifunctional electrocatalysts and their industrial operation on low&#8208;electricity pair&#8208;electrocatalysis platforms for the carbon cycle. Herein, an enzyme&#8208;inspired single&#8208;molecular heterojunction electrocatalyst ((NHx)16&#8208;NiPc/CNTs) with specific atomic nickel centers and amino&#8208;rich local microenvironments for industrial&#8208;level electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) and further energy&#8208;saving integrated CO2 electrolysis is designed and developed. (NHx)16&#8208;NiPc/CNTs exhibit unprecedented catalytic performance with industry&#8208;compatible current densities, &#8776;100% Faradaic efficiency and remarkable stability for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion, outperforming most reported catalysts. In addition to the enhanced CO2 capture by chemisorption, the sturdy deuterium kinetic isotope effect and proton inventory studies sufficiently reveal&#160;that such distinctive local microenvironments provide an effective proton ferry effect for improving local alkalinity and proton transfer and creating local interactions to stabilize the intermediate, ultimately enabling the high&#8208;efficiency operation of eCO2RR. Further, by using (NHx)16&#8208;NiPc/CNTs as a bifunctional electrocatalyst in a flow cell, a low&#8208;electricity overall CO2 electrolysis system coupling cathodic eCO2RR with anodic oxidation reaction is developed to achieve concurrent feed gas production and sulfur recovery, simultaneously decreasing the energy input. This work paves the new way in exploring molecular electrocatalysts and electrolysis systems with techno&#8208;economic feasibility.

This study presents new insights into biodegradable near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II fluorescence theranostic nanoparticles by coassembling a self&#8208;sacrificially biodegradable pseudo&#8208;conjugated&#8208;polymer as well as an amphiphilic polyester with doxorubicin via reactive oxygen species responsive thioketal linkages for photodynamic immunotherapy and photoactivated chemotherapy.








Abstract
Semiconducting polymers (SP) hold great promise for cancer phototherapy due to their excellent optical properties; however, their clinical application is still hampered by their poor biodegradability. Herein, a self&#8208;sacrificially biodegradable pseudo&#8208;semiconducting polymer (PSP) for NIR&#8208;II fluorescence bioimaging, photodynamic immunotherapy, and photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT) is reported. The PSP can further co&#8208;assemble with an amphiphilic polyester with pendant doxorubicin (DOX) in its side chains via reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive thioketal linkages (PEDOX), which are denoted as NP@PEDOX/PSP. The NP@PEDOX/PSP can accumulate at tumor sites and generate&#160;ROS&#160;for photodynamic immunotherapy as well as near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II fluorescence (NIR&#8208;II) for bioimaging upon irradition at 808 nm. The ROS could break up thioketal linkages in PEDOX, resulting in rapid doxorubicin (DOX) release for PACT. Finally, both PEDOX and PSP are degraded sacrificially by intracellular glutathione (GSH), resulting in the dissociation of NP@PEDOX/PSP. This work highlights the application of self&#8208;sacrificially degradable PSP for NIR&#8208;II fluorescence bioimaging, photodynamic immunotherapy, and PACT in cancer therapy.

Nanowires
In article number 2200656, Donglei Emma Fan, Yuebing Zheng, and co&#8208;workers achieve strong coupling between excitons and Mie resonances in chemically synthesized transition metal dichalcogenide nanowires. The coupling&#8208;induced optical responses are further modulated in a reversible way, enabling a new class of tunable photonic devices.

Printed Tough Hydrogels
In article number 2204333, Zi Liang Wu and co&#8208;workers demonstrate Digital Light Processing 3D printing of supramolecular hydrogels into sophisticated architectures with &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; projection approach. Fast gelation and toughening are realized during the printing by in situ formation of coordination complexes as physical crosslinks of the gel matrix, enabling high&#8208;efficiency processing of tough hydrogels as structural elements.

Lithium&#8208;Metal Anodes
In article number 2203992, Jae Young Seok, Sang Ouk Kim, and co&#8208;workers introduce an ultrathin multilayered protective layer under 1 &#956;m, composed of lithiophilic Ag nanoparticle seeds, a 2D Li&#8208;suppressing reduced graphene oxide (rGO) layer, and vertically porous block copolymer self&#8208;assembled nanochannels for lithium&#8208;metal anodes. The synergetic integration of each component enhances the mechanical robustness by stress relaxation, and homogenizes the Li&#8208;ion flux at the same time. As a result, stabilized Li growth with a smooth interface and outstanding cycling stability can be achieved.

Ferroelectric Materials
In article number 2204356, Ruzhong Zuo, Zhengqian Fu, Xiaoguang Li, Shujun Zhang, and co&#8208;workers report supercritical relaxor nanograined ferroelectrics for ultrahigh&#8208;energy&#8208;storage capacitors. The supercritical behavior, corresponding to the continuous reorientation of polar nanoregions but a negligible change in their size, can be achieved by engineering coexisted multiple local symmetries within the ergodic relaxor zone.

         <title>Recent Advances in Encapsulation of Flexible Bioelectronic Implants: Materials, Technologies, and Characterization Methods</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 34, August 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The state of the art and recent advances in encapsulations of flexible bioelectronic chronic implants are reviewed. The materials, deposition and application technologies, and cutting&#8208;edge characterization methods are described in detail. Smart encapsulations integrated into microfabrication, patterned, and actively interacting with the surrounding tissues are also highlighted.








Abstract
Bioelectronic implantable systems (BIS) targeting biomedical and clinical research should combine long&#8208;term performance and biointegration in vivo. Here, recent advances in novel encapsulations to protect flexible versions of such systems from the surrounding biological environment are reviewed, focusing on material strategies and synthesis techniques. Considerable effort is put on thin&#8208;film encapsulation (TFE), and specifically organic&#8211;inorganic multilayer architectures as a flexible and conformal alternative to conventional rigid cans. TFE is in direct contact with the biological medium and thus must exhibit not only biocompatibility, inertness, and hermeticity but also mechanical robustness, conformability, and compatibility with the manufacturing of microfabricated devices. Quantitative characterization methods of the barrier and mechanical performance of the TFE are reviewed with a particular emphasis on water&#8208;vapor transmission rate through electrical, optical, or electrochemical principles. The integrability and functionalization of TFE into functional bioelectronic interfaces are also discussed. TFE represents a must&#8208;have component for the next&#8208;generation bioelectronic implants with diagnostic or therapeutic functions in human healthcare and precision medicine.

         <title>Tailoring the Solvation Sheath of Cations by Constructing Electrode Front&#8208;Faces for Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 34, August 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using porous materials to construct electrode front&#8208;faces can transfer the high&#8208;energy&#8208;state desolvated solvents from reactive electrode to nonconductive porous material surfaces, thus eliminate the contact chances between desolvated solvents and electrode materials, and reduce solvents&#8208;related decomposition issues. The most recent advances in using advanced electrode front&#8208;faces in rechargeable batteries are comprehensively summarized. Strategies summarized are beneficial for efficient electrolyte design.








Abstract
Solvent molecules within the solvation sheath of cations (e.g., Li+, Na+, Zn2+) are easily to be dehydrogenated especially when coupled with high&#8208;voltage cathodes, and lead to detrimental electrolytes decompositions which finally accelerate capacity decays of rechargeable batteries. Tremendous efforts are devoted to tackle with this long&#8208;lasting issue. Among them, salt&#8208;concentrated strategies are frequently employed to tailor the solvation sheath of cations and improve the stabilities of electrolytes. However, the cost challenges caused by adding extra dose of expensive salts, additives/cosolvents in preparing highly concentrated electrolytes, hinder their further utilizations to some extent. Introducing porous materials&#8208;based electrode front&#8208;faces on the surface of electrodes even within dilute electrolytes can transfer the high&#8208;energy&#8208;state desolvated solvents from the reactive electrodes to the nonconductive porous material surfaces, thus eliminate the contact chances between desolvated solvents and electrode materials, and greatly reduce solvents&#8208;related decomposition issues. Herein, recent advances in using electrode front&#8208;faces to tailor the solvation sheath of metal ions for rechargeable batteries are discussed. Finally, perspectives to the future challenges and opportunities of constructing electrode front&#8208;faces to tailor the solvation sheath of cations by constructing electrode front&#8208;face for rechargeable batteries are provided.

         <title>Electrochemical Capacitors with Confined Redox Electrolytes and Porous Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 34, August 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox electrolyte&#8208;enhanced electrochemical capacitors constructed with confined redox electrolytes and porous electrodes feature the properties of high capacitance, high stability, and high energy and power densities. They are expected to occupy a dominant position among different electrochemical energy storage systems and are promising to be employed as power suppliers for various applications.








Abstract
Electrochemical capacitors (ECs), including electrical&#8208;double&#8208;layer capacitors and pseudocapacitors, feature high power densities but low energy densities. To improve the energy densities of ECs, redox electrolyte&#8208;enhanced ECs (R&#8208;ECs) or supercapbatteries are designed through employing confined soluble redox electrolytes and porous electrodes. In R&#8208;ECs the energy storage is based on diffusion&#8208;controlled faradaic processes of confined redox electrolytes at the surface of a porous electrode, which thus take the merits of high power densities of ECs and high energy densities of batteries. In the past few years, there has been great progress in the development of this energy storage technology, particularly in the design and synthesis of novel redox electrolytes and porous electrodes, as well as the configurations of new devices. Herein, a full&#8208;screen picture of the fundamentals and the state&#8208;of&#8208;art progress of R&#8208;ECs are given together with a discussion and outlines about the challenges and future perspectives of R&#8208;ECs. The strategies to improve the performance of R&#8208;ECs are highlighted from the aspects of their capacitances and capacitance retention, power densities, and energy densities. The insight into the philosophies behind these strategies will be favorable to promote the R&#8208;EC technology toward practical applications of supercapacitors in different fields.

         <title>Transformable ECM Deprivation System Effectively Suppresses Renal Cell Carcinoma by Reversing Anoikis Resistance and Increasing Chemotherapy Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Extracellular matrix (ECM) is crucial in various biological functions during tumor progression, including induction of anoikis resistance and cell adhesion&#8208;mediated drug resistance (CAM&#8208;DR). Fibronectin (FN), a vital ECM component with direct regulatory effects on ECM&#8208;mediated anoikis resistance and CAM&#8208;DR, making it an attractive and innovative therapeutic target for depriving ECM in tumor tissue. Herein, we develop an ECM deprivation system (EDS) based on FN targeting self&#8208;assembly peptide for constructing nanofibers in the ECM of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which contributes to (i) targeting and recognizing FN to form nanofibers for long&#8208;term retention in ECM, (ii) reversing anoikis resistance via arresting the FN signaling pathway, and (iii) serving as a drug&#8208;loading platform for sensitizing chemotherapy by ameliorating CAM&#8208;DR. Our results reveal that EDS significantly reverses anoikis resistance of RCC cells through inhibiting the phosphorylation of FAK, a positive regulator of FN signaling pathway. Meanwhile, EDS serves as a chemotherapy&#8208;sensitizer of cancer, exerting significant synergistic effects with DOX. In vivo validation experiments show that EDS effectively suppresses the metastasis and tumor growth with chemotherapy resistance. Collectively, the innovative EDS notably inhibits the tumor&#8208;promoting effect of ECM and might provide a novel approach for suppressing ECM and enhancing chemo&#8208;drug sensitivity.

Abstract
The development of advanced solid&#8208;state energy storage devices is contingent upon finding new ways to produce and manufacture scalable, high modulus solid&#8208;state electrolytes which can simultaneously provide high ionic conductivity and robust mechanical integrity. In this work, we report an efficient one&#8208;step process to manufacture solid polymer electrolytes composed of nano&#8208;scale ion&#8208;conducting channels embedded in a rigid crosslinked polymer matrix, via digital light projection 3D printing. A visible light mediated polymerization induced microphase separation approach is utilized, which produces materials with two chemically independent nanoscale domains with highly tunable nanoarchitectures. By producing materials containing a polyethylene oxide domain swelled with an ionic liquid, robust solid polymer electrolytes with outstanding room temperature (22&#176;C) shear modulus (G&#8217; &gt; 108 Pa) and ionic conductivities up to &#963; = 3 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S/cm are achieved. The nanostructured 3D printed electrolytes were fabricated into a custom geometry and employed in a symmetric carbon supercapacitor, demonstrating the scalability of the fabrication and the functionality of the electrolyte. Critically, these high&#8208;performance materials are manufactured on&#8208;demand using inexpensive and commercially available 3D printers, which allows the facile modular design of solid polymer electrolytes with custom geometries.

         <title>Probing the spin dimensionality in single&#8208;layer CrSBr van der Waals heterostructures by magneto&#8208;transport measurements</title>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) magnetic materials offer unprecedented opportunities for fundamental physics and applied research in spintronics and magnonics. Beyond the pioneering studies on 2D CrI3 and Cr2Ge2Te6, this emerging field has expanded to 2D antiferromagnets exhibiting different spin anisotropies and textures. Of particular interest is the layered metamagnet CrSBr, a relatively air&#8208;stable semiconductor formed by antiferromagnetically&#8208;coupled ferromagnetic layers (Tc&#8764;150 K) that can be exfoliated down to the single&#8208;layer. It presents a complex magnetic behavior with a dynamic magnetic crossover leading to a low&#8208;temperature hidden&#8208;order below T*&#8764;40 K. Here, we inspect the magneto&#8208;transport properties of CrSBr vertical heterostructures in the 2D limit. Our results demonstrate the marked low&#8208;dimensional character of the ferromagnetic monolayer, with short&#8208;range correlations above Tc and an Ising&#8208;type in&#8208;plane anisotropy, being the spins spontaneously aligned along the easy&#8208;axis b below Tc. By applying moderate magnetic fields along a and c axes, a spin reorientation occurs, leading to a magnetoresistance enhancement below T*. In multilayers, a spin&#8208;valve behavior is observed, with negative magnetoresistance strongly enhanced along the three directions below T*. These results show that CrSBr monolayer/bilayer provides an ideal platform for studying and controlling field&#8208;induced phenomena in two&#8208;dimensions, offering new insights regarding 2D magnets and their integration into vertical spintronic devices.

         <title>Realizing a 10&#176;C Cooling Effect in a Flexible Thermoelectric Cooler using a Vortex Generator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In this study, we use flexible thermoelectric coolers (FTECs) to develop an alternative personalized cooling technology to achieve a large temperature drop of &gt;10 &#176;C and cooling capacity of 256 W&#8729;m&#8211;2. Such an excellent cooling performance is attributed to the innovative design of the quadra&#8208;layered Ag2Se/poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate structure in FTECs and the induced air vortices by the vortex generator attached to the hot surface of the device. The applied pulse&#8208;width modulation technique guarantees human body comfort at inconsistent ambient temperature by modulating the duty ratio of the power source, which also saves 35% of the power consumption. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared FTECs only consume 68.5&#160;W so as to maintain a comfortable skin temperature (32&#177;0.5 &#176;C) when the ambient temperature is at 31 &#176;C. This technology provides a reliable and adjustable solution for personalized cooling in environments where comfortable temperatures are exceeded.

         <title>Antiferromagnetic&#8211;Ferromagnetic Heterostructure&#8208;Based Field&#8208;Free Terahertz Emitters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A field&#8208;free spintronic THz emitter is successfully realized in an antiferromagnetic&#8211;ferromagnetic (IrMn3|Co20Fe60B20) heterostructure, which facilitates the exchange bias or interfacial exchange coupling effect. Significantly, stronger spintronic THz radiation is generated using the coherent superposition of two heterojunctions with opposite pinning orientations.








Abstract
Recently, ferromagnetic&#8208;heterostructure spintronic terahertz (THz) emitters have been recognized as one of the most promising candidates for next&#8208;generation THz sources, owing to their peculiarities of high efficiency, high stability, low cost, ultrabroad bandwidth, controllable polarization, and high scalability. Despite the substantial efforts, they rely on external magnetic fields to initiate the spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion, which hitherto greatly limits their proliferation as practical devices. Here, a unique antiferromagnetic&#8211;ferromagnetic (IrMn3|Co20Fe60B20) heterostructure is innovated, and it is demonstrated that it can efficiently generate THz radiation without any external magnetic field. It is assigned to the exchange bias or interfacial exchange coupling effect and enhanced anisotropy. By precisely balancing the exchange bias effect and enhanced THz radiation efficiency, an optimized 5.6 nm&#8208;thick IrMn3|Co20Fe60B20|W trilayer heterostructure is successfully realized, yielding an intensity surpassing that of Pt|Co20Fe60B20|W. Moreover, the intensity of THz emission is further boosted by togethering the trilayer sample and bilayer sample. Besides, the THz polarization may be flexibly controlled by rotating the sample azimuthal angle, manifesting sophisticated active THz field manipulation capability. The field&#8208;free coherent THz emission that is demonstrated here shines light on the development of spintronic THz optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Single&#8208;Layer&#8208;Particle Electrode Design for Practical Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;layer chunky particle electrode with vertically aligned charge&#8208;transport pathways is designed, which address the issue of slow charge transport of common high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity electrodes caused by their high tortuosity and interparticle resistance, and simultaneously realizes a fast&#8208;charging capability and high energy density of Li&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Efforts to enable fast charging and high energy density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) are hampered by the trade&#8208;off nature of the traditional electrode design: increasing the areal capacity usually comes with sacrificing the fast charge transfer. Here a single&#8208;layer chunky particle electrode design is reported, where red&#8208;phosphorus active material is embedded in nanochannels of vertically aligned graphene (red&#8208;P/VAG) assemblies. Such an electrode design addresses the sluggish charge transfer stemming from the high tortuosity and inner particle/electrode resistance of traditional electrode architectures consisting of randomly stacked active particles. The vertical ion&#8208;transport nanochannels and electron&#8208;transfer conductive nanowalls of graphene confine the direction of charge transfer to minimize the transfer distance, and the incomplete filling of nanochannels in the red&#8208;P/VAG composite buffers volume change locally, thus avoiding the variation of electrodes thickness during cycling. The single&#8208;layer chunky particle electrode displays a high areal capacity (5.6 mAh cm&#8722;2), which is the highest among the reported fast&#8208;charging battery chemistries. Paired with a high&#8208;loading LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622) cathode, a pouch cell shows stable cycling with high energy and power densities. Such a single&#8208;layer chunky particle electrode design can be extended to other advanced battery systems and boost the development of LIBs with fast&#8208;charging capability and high energy density.

         <title>Piezoelectricity across 2D Phase Boundaries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The piezoelectric responses at 2D&#8208;material phase boundaries are studied and a strong piezoelectric response at the 2H&#8211;1T&#8242; junction is observed, owing to the charge transfer across the semiconducting and metallic junctions, resulting in the formation of dipoles and excess charge density, allowing the engineering of piezoelectric response in atomically thin materials.








Abstract
Piezoelectricity in low&#8208;dimensional materials and metal&#8211;semiconductor junctions has attracted recent attention. Herein, a 2D in&#8208;plane metal&#8211;semiconductor junction made of multilayer 2H and 1T&#8242; phases of molybdenum(IV) telluride (MoTe2) is investigated. Strong piezoelectric response is observed using piezoresponse force microscopy at the 2H&#8211;1T&#8242; junction, despite that the multilayers of each individual phase are weakly piezoelectric. The experimental results and density functional theory calculations suggest that the amplified piezoelectric response observed at the junction is due to the charge transfer across the semiconducting and metallic junctions resulting in the formation of dipoles and excess charge density, allowing the engineering of piezoelectric response in atomically thin materials.

         <title>Rationally Structured Triboelectric Nanogenerator Arrays for Harvesting Water&#8208;Current Energy and Self&#8208;Powered Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Paired nanogenerators capable of integrating massively into a thin flexible layer as a structured triboelectric surface are demonstrated for harvesting water&#8208;current energy. Through novel gas packet exchange structure and rigid&#8211;flexible coupling deformation mechanism, the device can work effectively even in deep water with greatly enhanced performance, providing universal strategies to fabricate high&#8208;frequency triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) under large pressure.








Abstract
Water&#8208;current energy is an enormous and widely distributed clean energy in nature, with different scales from large ocean flow to small local turbulence. However, few effective technologies have been proposed to make use of different forms of water currents as a power source. Here, high&#8208;performance paired triboelectric nanogenerators (P&#8208;TENGs) capable of integrating massively into a thin flexible layer as a structured triboelectric surface (STS) are demonstrated for harvesting water&#8208;current energy. Novel gas packet exchange structure and rigid&#8211;flexible coupling deformation mechanism are introduced to ensure that the device can work very effectively even in deep water under high water pressure. The rationally designed TENG array in the STS enables highly efficient power take&#8208;off from the flow. Typically, the STS demonstrates a high&#8208;frequency output up to 57&#160;Hz, largely superior to current TENG devices, and the power density is improved by over 100 times for triboelectric devices harvesting current energy. The flexible STS is capable of attaching to various surfaces or applying independently for self&#8208;powered sensing and underwater power supply, showing great potential for water&#8208;current energy utilization. Moreover, the work also initiates universal strategies to fabricate high&#8208;frequency devices under large environment pressure, which may profoundly enrich the design of TENGs.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Degradable 3D Microstructures in Aqueous Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoresist for the additive manufacturing technique direct laser writing is realized, which is degradable upon irradiation with visible light (&#955;max&#160;=&#160;415&#8211;435&#160;nm) in water. The degradation of microstructures fabricated using the degradable photoresist is quantified using atomic force microscopy. Multimaterial 3D microstructures that incorporate the degradable material are fabricated.








Abstract
The additive manufacturing technique direct laser writing (DLW), also known as two&#8208;photon laser lithography, is becoming increasingly established as a technique capable of fabricating functional 3D microstructures. Recently, there has been an increasing effort to impart microstructures fabricated using DLW with advanced functionalities by introducing responsive chemical entities into the underpinning photoresists. Herein, a novel photoresist based on the photochemistry of the bimane group is introduced that can be degraded upon exposure to very mild conditions, requiring only water and visible light (&#955;max&#160;=&#160;415&#8211;435&#160;nm) irradiation. The degradation of the microstructures is tracked and quantified using AFM measurements of their height. The influence of the writing parameters as well as the degradation conditions is investigated, unambiguously evidencing effective visible light degradation in aqueous environments. Finally, the utility of the photodegradable resist system is demonstrated by incorporating it into multimaterial 3D microstructures, serving as a model for future applications.

         <title>Unbreakable Hydrogels with Self&#8208;Recoverable 10200% Stretchability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Design of tough hydrogels maintaining structural integrity under multivariable mechanical loads remains huge challenging because the anticipated characteristics such as stretchability, strength, toughness, and fracture resistance can hardly be compatible. Herein, we propose a simple but robust hydrogel network formed by copolymerization of divinyl benzene with acrylamide in micellar solutions to achieve both ultra&#8208;high fracture resistance and self&#8208;recoverable stretchability. The network provides dynamic association of hydrophobic domains and homogenous crosslinking of hydrophilic chains, which showed step&#8208;by&#8208;step deformation process for effective energy dissipation. The dynamic associations allow recoverable small deformations of hydrogels, then the homogenous crosslinking ensures reversible unfolding and alignment of polymer chains to self&#8208;strengthen for ultra&#8208;large deformations without crack propagations. The resultant hydrogels exhibit comprehensive unbreakable feature with self&#8208;recoverable ultra&#8208;high stretchability (100% recovery from 10200% strain), superior fracture resistance (fracture work &gt; 18.8&#160;MJ m&#8211;3, toughness &gt; 26&#160;kJ m&#8211;2), and anti&#8208;crack propagation and fatigue (fatigue threshold: &#8764; 2.5&#160;kJ m&#8211;2). Even the pre&#8208;notched hydrogels can intriguingly undergo tens cyclic loads at 10200% strain and thousands cyclic loads at 200% strain without noticeable changes in mechanical performance. The robust network prepared from homogenous hydrophobic crosslinking provides a facile approach and a new mechanism to explore tough hydrogels with superior anti&#8208;fracture and extreme self&#8208;recoverable deformability for diverse applications

         <title>Balancing the selective absorption and photon&#8208;to&#8208;electron conversion for semitransparent organic photovoltaics with 5.0% light utilization efficiency</title>

Abstract
Efficiently converting invisible light while allowing full visible light transmission is key to achieving high&#8208;performance semitransparent organic photovoltaics (ST&#8208;OPVs). Here, a detailed balance strategy is explored to optimize the ST&#8208;OPV via taking both absorption and carrier dynamics into consideration. Based on this principle, comprehensive optimizations were carried out, including ternary strategy, donor:acceptor blend ratio, thickness, anti&#8208;reflection, etc., to compromise the invisible energy conversion and visible transmission for high&#8208;performance ST&#8208;OPVs. As a result, the opaque OPV device exhibits a champion PCE of 19.35% (certificated 19.07%), and most strikingly, the best ST&#8208;OPV show a remarkably high light utilization efficiency of 5.0%, where the efficiency and the average visible transmission are 12.95% and 38.67%, respectively. An efficiency of 12.09% is achieved on the up&#8208;scaled device with an area of 1.05 cm2, demonstrating their promise for large&#8208;area fabrication. These results are among the best values for ST&#8208;OPVs. Besides, we demonstrate that the ST&#8208;OPV exhibits good infrared light reflection capability for thermal control. Our work provides a rational design of balancing the absorbing selectivity and photon&#8208;to&#8208;electron conversion for high&#8208;performance ST&#8208;OPVs, and may pave the way toward the practical application of solar windows.

         <title>Large Memory Window of van der Waals Heterostructure Devices Based on MOCVD&#8208;Grown 2D Layered Ge4Se9</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure has drawn much interest over the last decade owing to its absence of dangling bonds and their intriguing low&#8208;dimensional properties. The emergence of 2D materials has enabled the achievement of significant progress in both the discovery of physical phenomena and the realization of superior devices. Here, we are the first to introduce the group IV metal chalcogenide of 2D&#8208;layered Ge4Se9 as a new selection of insulating vdW material. We synthesized 2D&#8208;layered Ge4Se9 with a rectangular shape using the MOCVD system using liquid germanium precursor at 240 &#176;C. By stacking the Ge4Se9 and MoS2, we fabricated the vdW heterostructure devices with a giant memory window of 129&#160;V by sweeping back gate range of &#177;80&#160;V. The gate&#8208;independent decay time reveals that the large hysteresis is induced by the interfacial charge transfer, which originates from the low band offset. Moreover, we observed repeatable conductance changes over the 2,250 pulses with low non&#8208;linearity values of 0.26 and 0.95 for potentiation and depression curves, respectively. The energy consumption of MoS2/Ge4Se9 device was about 15 fJ for operating energy and the learning accuracy of image classification reached 88.3%, which further proves the great potential of artificial synapses.

         <title>Multidimensional Perovskites for High Detectivity Photodiodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional perovskites attract increasing interest due to tuneable optoelectronic properties and high stability. Here, we show that perovskite thin films with a vertical gradient in dimensionality result in graded electronic bandgap structures that are ideal for photodiode applications. Positioning low&#8208;dimensional, vertically&#8208;oriented perovskite phases at the interface with the electron blocking layer increases the activation energy for thermal charge generation and thereby effectively lowers the dark current density to a record&#8208;low value of 5 &#215; 10&#8722;9&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 without compromising responsivity, resulting in a noise&#8208;current&#8208;based specific detectivity exceeding 7 &#215; 1012 Jones at 600&#160;nm. These multidimensional perovskite photodiodes show promising air stability and a dynamic range over ten orders of magnitude, and thus represent a new generation of high&#8208;performance low&#8208;cost photodiodes.

         <title>Visible Light Induced Ag&#8208;polyoxometalate Co&#8208;assembly into Single&#8208;cluster Nanowires</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
One&#8208;dimensional (1D) superlattices with long&#8208;ranged periodicity present extraordinary application properties due to their unique electronic structures. Here we report the visible light driven synthesis of 1D single&#8208;cluster chains constructed by POM and Ag clusters, where two types of clusters aligned alternatively along the nanowire. Low symmetrical POM clusters of [P2W17O61]10&#8211;, [P2W15O56]12&#8211;, and [EuW10O36]9&#8211; can be used as building blocks. The directly bonding cluster units result in interactive electronic structures of Ag and POM clusters, as well as the greatly promoted electron transfer during the redox reaction. The Ag&#8208;P2W17 nanowires perform significantly enhanced activities in both electrochemical sensing and catalytic gasoline desulfurization compared with individual building blocks, demonstrating the extraordinary application properties and promising potentials of cluster&#8208;based hetero&#8208;constructions.

         <title>Controlled Covalent Self&#8208;Assembly of a Homopolymer for Multiscale Materials Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new mechanism to induce controlled polymer self&#8208;assembly is reported. By crosslinking a ketone homopolymer, it self&#8208;assembles into nano&#8208; to macroscale materials, which is sorely driven by covalent bonding. The covalent self&#8208;assembly demonstrates exceptionally high levels of processability with a simple protocol compared to non&#8208;covalent self&#8208;assembly. Covalent self&#8208;assembly yields materials which are previously complicated to synthesize.








Abstract
Polymer self&#8208;assembly is a crucial process in materials engineering. Currently, almost all polymer self&#8208;assembly is limited to non&#8208;covalent bonding methods, even though these methods have drawbacks as they require complicated synthesis techniques and produce relatively unstable structures. Here, a novel mechanism of covalent polymer self&#8208;assembly is discovered and employed to address drawbacks of non&#8208;covalent polymer self&#8208;assembly. A simple ketone homopolymer is found to self&#8208;assemble into nano&#8208; to macroscale hydrogels during covalent crosslinking. In contrast to non&#8208;covalent self&#8208;assembly, the covalent self&#8208;assembly is independent of and unaffected by solvent conditions (e.g., polarity and ionic strength) and does not require additional agents, e.g., organic solvents and surfactants. The covalent polymer self&#8208;assembly is subjected to a new mechanism of control by tuning the covalent crosslinking rate. This leads to nanogels with an unprecedented and tightly controlled range of dimensions from less than 10&#160;nm to above 100&#160;nm. Moreover, the crosslinking rate also regulates the assembly behavior of microgels fabricated by microfluidics. The microgels self&#8208;assemble into granular fibers, which is 3D printed into stable porous scaffolds. The novel covalent polymer assembly method has enormous potential to revolutionize multiscale materials fabrication for applications in drug delivery, tissue engineering, and many other fields.

         <title>Microstructured BN Composites with Internally Designed High Thermal Conductivity Paths for 3D Electronic Packaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the magnetically assisted slip casting method, microstructures of boron nitride composites are purposely designed and highly oriented to achieve unusually high thermal conductivity and directional heat transfer toward specific areas along the direction of microplatelet alignment, opening up the solutions for the next&#8208;generation thermal management for 3D electronic packaging.








Abstract
Miniaturized and high&#8208;power&#8208;density 3D electronic devices pose new challenges on thermal management. Indeed, prompt heat dissipation in electrically insulating packaging is currently limited by the thermal conductivity achieved by thermal interface materials (TIMs) and by their capability to direct the heat toward heat sinks. Here, high thermal conductivity boron nitride (BN)&#8208;based composites that are able to conduct heat intentionally toward specific areas by locally orienting magnetically functionalized BN microplatelets are created using magnetically assisted slip casting. The obtained thermal conductivity along the direction of alignment is unusually high, up to 12.1&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, thanks to the high concentration of 62.6 vol% of BN in the composite, the low concentration in polymeric binder, and the high degree of alignment. The BN composites have a low density of 1.3&#160;g cm&#8722;3, a high stiffness of 442.3&#160;MPa, and are electrically insulating. Uniquely, the approach is demonstrated with proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept composites having locally graded orientations of BN microplatelets to direct the heat away from two vertically stacked heat sources. Rationally designing the microstructure of TIMs to direct heat strategically provides a promising solution for efficient thermal management in 3D integrated electronics.

         <title>Coherent Precipitates with Strong Domain Wall Pinning in Alkaline Niobate Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coherent precipitates are introduced in lithium sodium niobate polycrystalline piezoceramics. The strong pinning effect on domain walls is demonstrated by a largely reduced polarization hysteresis and enhanced mechanical quality factor Qm by one order of magnitude from &#8776;80 to &#8776;600. while the piezoelectric coefficient remains nearly unchanged. This enhancement in Qm is stable at a large vibration velocity up to 0.8&#160;m&#160;s&#8722;1.








Abstract
High&#8208;power piezoelectric applications are predicted to share approximately one&#8208;third of the lead&#8208;free piezoelectric ceramic market in 2024 with alkaline niobates as the primary competitor. To suppress self&#8208;heating in high&#8208;power devices due to mechanical loss when driven by large electric fields, piezoelectric hardening to restrict domain wall motion is required. In the present work, highly effective piezoelectric hardening via coherent plate&#8208;like precipitates in a model system of the (Li,Na)NbO3 (LNN) solid solution delivers a reduction in losses, quantified as an electromechanical quality factor, by a factor of ten. Various thermal aging schemes are demonstrated to control the average size, number density, and location of the precipitates. The established properties are correlated with a detailed determination of short&#8208; and long&#8208;range atomic structure by X&#8208;ray diffraction and pair distribution function analysis, respectively, as well as microstructure determined by transmission electron microscopy. The impact of microstructure with precipitates on both small&#8208; and large&#8208;field properties is also established. These results pave the way to implement precipitate hardening in piezoelectric materials, analogous to precipitate hardening in metals, broadening their use cases in applications.

         <title>Aqueous analog MAC machine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Using ions in aqueous milieu for signal processing, like in biological circuits, may potentially lead to a bio&#8208;inspired information processing platform. Studies, however, have focused on individual ionic diodes and transistors rather than circuits comprising many such devices. Here we develop a 16 &#215; 16 array of new ionic transistors in an aqueous quinone solution. Each transistor features a concentric ring electrode pair with a disk electrode at the center. Electrochemistry of these electrodes in the solution provides the basis for the transistor operation. The ring pair electrochemically tunes the local electrolytic concentration to modulate the disk's Faradaic reaction rate. Thus the disk current as a Faradaic reaction to the disk voltage is gated by the ring pair. The 16 &#215; 16 array of these transistors performs analog multiply&#8208;accumulate (MAC) operations, a computing modality hotly pursued for low&#8208;power artificial neural network. This exploits the transistor's operating regime where the disk current is a multiplication of the disk voltage and a weight parameter tuned by the ring pair gating. Such disk currents from multiple transistors are summated in a global reference electrode to complete a MAC task. This ionic circuit demonstrating analog computing is a step towards sophisticated aqueous ionics.

         <title>Role of Moisture and Oxygen in Defect Management and Orderly Oxidation Boosting Carbon&#8208;Based CsPbI2Br Solar Cells to A New Record Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Large energy loss (Eloss) caused by defect&#8208;assisted recombination makes the photovoltaic performance of carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (C&#8208;PSCs) inferior to that of metal&#8208;electrode ones. Herein, the influence of environmental factors (moisture and oxygen) on defect management during re&#8208;annealing process of CsPbI2Br crystalline films are systematically studied. Density functional theory and experimental results indicate that moisture in air can significantly reduce the oxidation kinetics of crystalline films, resulting in orderly oxidation. Concomitantly, the oxidation decomposition products PbO and CsPbIBr2 are enriched at grain boundaries, passivating surface defects efficiently. Simultaneously, energy band coupling between CsPbI2Br and CsPbIBr2 improves the hole extraction efficiency. The photovoltage of corresponding C&#8208;PSCs is increased from 1.05 to 1.32&#160;V, indicating a reduced Eloss derived from orderly oxidation strategy. Correspondingly, the champion cell achieves an efficiency of 15.27%, and a certified efficiency of 14.7%, which is a new record efficiency for CsPbI2Br C&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Hollow Nanomaterials in Advanced Drug Delivery Systems: From Single&#8208; to Multiple Shells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hollow structured nanomaterials (HSNMs) have attracted increased interest in biomedical fields, owing to their excellent potential as drug delivery systems (DDSs) for clinical applications. Among HSNMs, hollow multi&#8208;shelled structures (HoMSs) exhibit properties such as high loading capacity, sequential drug release, and multi&#8208;functionalized modification and represent a new class of nanoplatforms for clinical applications. The remarkable properties of HoMS&#8208;based DDS can simultaneously satisfy and enhance DDSs for delivering small molecular drugs (e.g., antibiotics, chemotherapy drugs, and imaging agents) and macromolecular drugs (e.g., protein/peptide&#8208; and nucleic acid&#8208;based drugs). First, we summarize the latest research advances in delivering small molecular drugs and highlight the inherent advantages of HoMS&#8208;based DDSs for small molecular drug targeting, combining continuous therapeutic drug delivery and theranostics to optimize the clinical benefit. Meanwhile, the macromolecular drugs DDSs are in the initial development stage and currently offer limited delivery modes. There is a growing need to analyze the deficiency of other HSNMs and integrate the advantages of HSNMs, providing solutions for the safe, stable, cascade delivery of macromolecular drugs to meet vast treatment requirements. Therefore, we comprehensively review the latest advances in HoMS&#8208;based DDSs, mainly focusing on the characteristics, research progress by drug category, and future research prospects.

         <title>In Situ Silver&#8208;Based Electrochemical Oncolytic Bioreactor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
In this study, we showed for the first time that a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) carrier has a 20&#8208;fold higher catalysis rate than graphene oxide (GO) in Ag+ reduction. Based on this, we constructed a tumor microenvironment&#8208;enabled in situ silver&#8208;based electrochemical oncolytic bioreactor (SEOB) which switched Ag+ prodrugs into in situ therapeutic silver nanoparticles with and above 95% transition rate to inhibit the growths of various tumors. In this SEOB&#8208;enabled intratumoral nanosynthetic medicine, intratumoral H2O2 and rGO acted as the reductant and the catalyst, respectively. Chelation of aptamers to the SEOB&#8208;unlocked prodrugs increased the production of silver nanoparticles in tumor cells, especially in the presence of Vitamin C, which was broke down in tumor cells to supply massive amounts of H2O2. Consequently, apoptosis and pyroptosis were induced to cooperatively contribute to the considerably&#8208;elevated anti&#8208;tumor effects on subcutaneous HepG2 and A549 tumors and orthotopic implanted HepG2 tumors in livers of nude mice. The specific aptamer targeting and intratumoral silver nanoparticle production guaranteed excellent biosafety since it failed to elicit tissue damages in monkeys, which greatly increased the clinical translation potential of the SEOB system.

Abstract
Hollow nanostructures with fascinating properties have inspired numerous interests in broad research fields. Cell&#8208;mimicking complex hollow architectures with precise active components distributions are particularly important, while their synthesis remains highly challenging. Herein, we introduce a &#8220;top&#8208;down&#8221; chemical surgery strategy to engrave the 3&#8208;aminophenol formaldehyde resin (APF) spheres at nanoscale. Undergoing the cleavage of (Ar)C&#8208;N bonds with ethanol as chemical scissors and subsequent repolymerization process, the solid APF spheres transform to multilevel hollow architecture with precise nanospatial distribution of organic functional groups (e.g., hydroxymethyl and amine groups). The transformation is tracked by electron microscopy and solid&#8208;state NMR techniques, the category and dosage of alcohol are pivotal for the formation of multilevel hollow structures. Moreover, we demonstrate the evolution of nanostructures accompanied with unique organic microenvironments is able to accurately confine multiple gold nanoparticles, leading to the formation of pomegranate&#8208;like particles. Through selective deposition of Pd nanoparticles onto the outer shell, bimetallic Au@APF@Pd catalysts are formed, which exhibit excellent catalytic hydrogenation performance with turnover frequency (TOF) value up to 11257 h&#8211;1. This work provides an effective method for precisely manipulating the nanostructure and composition of polymers on the nanoscale and sheds lights on the design of catalysts with precise spatial active components.

         <title>Accurate Wavelength Tracking by Exciton Spin Mixing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for wavelength tracking from a simple single&#8208;pixel sensor is presented. The concept is based on the excitation&#8208;wavelength&#8208;dependent spin mixing ratio of a blended film comprising organic room&#8208;temperature phosphors and colloid quantum dots, and can discriminate wavelength shifts below 1&#160;nm. Potential application scenarios and the respective adaptations to the material system and evaluation routine are discussed.








Abstract
Wavelength&#8208;discriminating systems typically consist of heavy benchtop&#8208;based instruments, comprising diffractive optics, moving parts, and adjacent detectors. For simple wavelength measurements, such as lab&#8208;on&#8208;chip light source calibration or laser wavelength tracking, which do not require polychromatic analysis and cannot handle bulky spectroscopy instruments, lightweight, easy&#8208;to&#8208;process, and flexible single&#8208;pixel devices are attracting increasing attention. Here, a device is proposed for monotonously transforming wavelength information into the time domain with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence at the heart of its functionality, which demonstrates a resolution down to 1 nm and below. It is solution&#8208;processed from a single host&#8211;guest system comprising organic room&#8208;temperature phosphors and colloidal quantum dots. The share of excited triplet states within the photoluminescent layer is dependent on the excitation wavelength and determines the afterglow intensity of the film, which is tracked by a simple photodetector. Finally, an all&#8208;organic thin&#8208;film wavelength sensor and two applications are demonstrated where this novel measurement concept successfully replaces a full spectrometer.

         <title>Polishing the Lead&#8208;Poor Surface&#160;for Efficient Inverted CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intrinsically lead&#8208;poor surface is found on CsPbI3 films and it limits the efficiency improvement of inverted CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells for inferior electron transfer and serious nonradiative recombination at CsPbI3/6,6&#8208;phenyl C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester interface. Compared to molecular passivation, 1,4&#8208;butanediamine can polish the lead&#8208;poor surface for fluent electron transfer, and significantly improve the Voc and fill factor with a recorded efficiency of 19.84% and excellent stability.








Abstract
Triiodide cesium lead perovskite (CsPbI3) has promising prospects in the development of efficient and stable photovoltaics in both single&#8208;junction and tandem structures. However, achieving inverted devices that provide good stability and are compatible to tandem devices remains a challenge, and the deep insights are still not understood. This study finds that the surface components of CsPbI3 are intrinsically lead&#8208;poor and the relevant traps are of p&#8208;type with localized states. These deep&#8208;energy&#8208;level p traps induce inferior transfer or electrons and serious nonradiative recombination at the CsPbI3/PCBM interface, leading to the considerable open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) loss and reduction of fill factor (FF). Compared to molecular passivation, polishing treatment with 1,4&#8208;butanediamine can eliminate the nonstoichiometric components and root these intrinsically lead&#8208;poor traps for superior electron transfer. The polishing treatment significantly improves the FF and Voc of the inverted CsPbI3 photovoltaics, creating an efficiency promotion from 12.64% to 19.84%. Moreover, 95% of the initial efficiency of the optimized devices is maintained after the output operation for 1000 h.

A novel design and scalable fabrication of zero&#8208;volume&#8208;expansion lithium&#8208;composite anodes with high electrochemical and mechanical stability through simple roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll manufacturing processes is proposed. The sandwich&#8208;like trilayer structure of zero&#8208;volume&#8208;expansion lithium&#8208;composite anodes can simultaneously suppress dendrite formation, eliminate volume change during cycling, and provides excellent mechanical robustness.








Abstract
The lithium (Li)&#8208;metal anode offers a promising solution for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). However, the significant volume expansion of the Li metal during charging results in poor cycling stability as a result of the dendritic deposition and broken solid electrolyte interphase. Herein, a facile one&#8208;step roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll fabrication of a zero&#8208;volume&#8208;expansion Li&#8208;metal&#8208;composite anode (zeroVE&#8208;Li) is proposed to realize high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LMBs with outstanding electrochemical and mechanical stability. The zeroVE&#8208;Li possesses a sandwich&#8208;like trilayer structure, which consists of an upper electron&#8208;insulating layer and a bottom lithiophilic layer that synergistically guides the Li deposition from the bottom up, and a middle porous layer that eliminates volume expansion. This sandwich structure eliminates dendrite formation, prevents volume change during cycling, and provides outstanding flexibility to the Li&#8208;metal anode even at a practical areal capacity over 3.0&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. Pairing zeroVE&#8208;Li with a commercial NMC811 or LCO cathode, flexible LMBs that offer a record&#8208;breaking figure of merit (FOM, 45.6), large whole&#8208;cell energy density (375&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8722;1, based on the volume of the anode, separator, cathode, and package), high&#8208;capacity retention (&gt; 99.8% per cycle), and remarkable mechanical robustness under practical conditions are demonstrated.

         <title>Metamaterial Absorbers: From Tunable Surface to Structural Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metamaterial absorbers (MAs), designed using artificial subwavelength structures, feature low profile and unique absorption. Employing active components into the element designs facilitate multifunction and miniaturization of MAs. A comprehensive and systematical review covering the work essentially conducted in the domain of cutting&#8208;edge active MAs is presented, highlighting innovative materials and unique strategies to manipulate electromagnetic response at frequencies up to optical regions.








Abstract
Since the first demonstration, remarkable progress has been made in the theoretical analysis, structural design, numerical simulation, and potential applications of metamaterial absorbers (MAs). With the continuous advancement of novel materials and creative designs, the absorption of MAs is significantly improved over a wide frequency spectrum from microwaves to the optical regime. Further, the integration of active elements into the MA design allows the dynamical manipulation of electromagnetic waves, opening a new platform to push breakthroughs in metadevices. In the last several years, numerous efforts have been devoted to exploring innovative approaches for incorporating tunability to MAs, which is highly desirable because of the progressively increasing demand on designing versatile metadevices. Here, a comprehensive and systematical overview of active MAs with adaptive and on&#8208;demand manner is presented, highlighting innovative materials and unique strategies to precisely control the electromagnetic response. In addition to the mainstream method by manipulating periodic patterns, two additional approaches, including tailoring dielectric spacer and transforming overall structure are called back. Following this, key parameters, such as operating frequency, relative tuning range, and switching speed are summarized and compared to guide for optimum design. Finally, potential opportunities in the development of active MAs are discussed.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the first demonstration, remarkable progress has been made in the theoretical analysis, structural design, numerical simulation, and potential applications of metamaterial absorbers (MAs). With the continuous advancement of novel materials and creative designs, the absorption of MAs is significantly improved over a wide frequency spectrum from microwaves to the optical regime. Further, the integration of active elements into the MA design allows the dynamical manipulation of electromagnetic waves, opening a new platform to push breakthroughs in metadevices. In the last several years, numerous efforts have been devoted to exploring innovative approaches for incorporating tunability to MAs, which is highly desirable because of the progressively increasing demand on designing versatile metadevices. Here, a comprehensive and systematical overview of active MAs with adaptive and on-demand manner is presented, highlighting innovative materials and unique strategies to precisely control the electromagnetic response. In addition to the mainstream method by manipulating periodic patterns, two additional approaches, including tailoring dielectric spacer and transforming overall structure are called back. Following this, key parameters, such as operating frequency, relative tuning range, and switching speed are summarized and compared to guide for optimum design. Finally, potential opportunities in the development of active MAs are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cooperative Coupling of H2O2 Production and Organic Synthesis over a Floatable Polystyrene&#8208;Sphere&#8208;Supported TiO2/Bi2O3 S&#8208;Scheme Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A floatable polystyrene&#8208;sphere&#8208;supported TiO2/Bi2O3 S&#8208;scheme photocatalyst is fabricated, which exhibits a high yield of H2O2 and furoic acid in the triphase system. Detailed spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal the step&#8208;scheme mechanism and pathways of H2O2 and furoic acid evolution, respectively. The merits of the S&#8208;scheme and triphase system are responsible for the extraordinary photocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Cooperative coupling of photocatalytic H2O2 production with organic synthesis has an expansive perspective in converting solar energy into storable chemical energy. However, traditional powder photocatalysts suffer from severe agglomeration, limited light absorption, poor gas reactant accessibility, and reusable difficulty, which greatly hinders their large&#8208;scale application. Herein, floatable composite photocatalysts are synthesized by immobilizing hydrophobic TiO2 and Bi2O3 on lightweight polystyrene (PS) spheres via hydrothermal and photodeposition methods. The floatable photocatalysts are not only solar transparent, but also upgrade the contact between reactants and photocatalysts. Thus, the floatable step&#8208;scheme (S&#8208;scheme) TiO2/Bi2O3 photocatalyst exhibits a drastically enhanced H2O2 yield of 1.15&#160;mm h&#8722;1 and decent furfuryl alcohol conversion to furoic acid synchronously. Furthermore, the S&#8208;scheme mechanism and dynamics are systematically investigated by in situ irradiated X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and femtosecond transient absorption spectrum analyses. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal the mechanism of furoic acid evolution. The ingenious design of floatable photocatalysts not only furnishes insight into maximizing photocatalytic reaction kinetics but also provides a new route for highly efficient heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Stacking and Twisting of Freestanding Complex Oxide Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new platform is developed for assembling freestanding oxide thin films with different materials and orientations into artificial stacks of heterointerfaces. The heterointerfaces can be tailored by controlling the stacking sequences, as well as the twist angle between the constituent layers with atomically sharp interfaces, leading to distinct moir&#233; patterns.








Abstract
The integration of dissimilar materials in heterostructures has long been a&#160;cornerstone of modern materials science&#8212;seminal examples are 2D materials and van der Waals heterostructures. Recently, new methods have been developed that enable the realization of ultrathin freestanding oxide films approaching the 2D limit. Oxides offer new degrees of freedom, due to the strong electronic interactions, especially the 3d orbital electrons, which give rise to rich exotic phases. Inspired by this progress, a new platform for assembling freestanding oxide thin films with different materials and orientations into artificial stacks with heterointerfaces is developed. It is shown that the oxide stacks can be tailored by controlling the stacking sequences, as well as the twist angle between the constituent layers with atomically sharp interfaces, leading to distinct moir&#233; patterns in the transmission electron microscopy images of the full stacks. Stacking and twisting is recognized as a key degree of structural freedom in 2D materials but, until now, has never been realized for oxide materials. This approach opens unexplored avenues for fabricating artificial 3D oxide stacking heterostructures with freestanding membranes across a broad range of complex oxide crystal structures with functionalities not available in conventional 2D materials.

         <title>Tailoring the Thickness&#8208;Dependent Optical Properties of Conducting Nitrides and Oxides for Epsilon&#8208;Near&#8208;Zero&#8208;Enhanced Photonic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polycrystalline titanium nitride and aluminum&#8208;doped zinc oxide with strong thickness&#8208;dependent optical properties are grown. The bilayer stacks support Ferrell&#8211;Berreman modes spanning from 1470 to 1750 nm, and also strongly absorb light in the ultraviolet regime. The resonators exhibit picosecond all&#8208;optical switching. Using field enhancements near the tailorable epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero regime can enable nonlinear optical phenomena across a wide optical wavelength range.








Abstract
The unique properties of the emerging photonic materials, conducting nitrides and oxides, especially their tailorability, large damage thresholds, and, importantly, the so&#8208;called epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero (ENZ) behavior, have enabled novel photonic phenomena spanning optical circuitry, tunable metasurfaces, and nonlinear optical devices. This work explores direct control of the optical properties of polycrystalline titanium nitride (TiN) and aluminum&#8208;doped zinc oxide (AZO) by tailoring the film thickness, and their potential for ENZ&#8208;enhanced photonic applications. This study demonstrates that TiN&#8211;AZO bilayers support Ferrell&#8211;Berreman modes using the thickness&#8208;dependent ENZ resonances in the AZO films operating in the telecom wavelengths spanning from 1470 to 1750&#160;nm. The bilayer stacks also act as strong light absorbers in the ultraviolet regime using the radiative ENZ modes and the Fabry&#8211;Perot modes in the constituent TiN films. The studied Berreman resonators exhibit optically induced reflectance modulation of 15% with picosecond response time. Together with the optical response tailorability of conducting oxides and nitrides, using the field enhancement near the tunable ENZ regime can enable a wide range of nonlinear optical phenomena, including all&#8208;optical switching, time refraction, and high&#8208;harmonic generation.

         <title>Experimental Realization of a Superdispersion&#8208;Enabled Ultrabroadband Terahertz Cloak</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Invisibility has been a topic of long&#8208;standing interest, but still faces an open challenge of narrow bandwidth. In this work, it is found that by judiciously harnessing the material dispersion, one can significantly increase the bandwidth of a cloak. As a proof of concept, an ultrabroadband terahertz carpet cloak is experimentally demonstrated in both time&#8208; and frequency&#8208;domain systems. The work presents a feasible invisibility strategy that is closer to practical applications.








Abstract
Invisibility has been a topic of long&#8208;standing interest owing to the advent of metamaterials and transformation optics, but still faces open challenges after its tremendous development in recent decades. One of the big challenges is the narrow bandwidth, as the realization of an invisibility cloak is usually based on a metamaterial&#8212;an artificial composite material composed of subwavelength resonator structures that are always associated with dispersion. Different from previous works that have tried to eliminate the material dispersion to enhance the bandwidth of an&#160;invisibility cloak, here, it is found that by judiciously harnessing the material dispersion, the bandwidth of the cloak can still be significantly increased. Interestingly, the material dispersion does not violate the law of causality. As a proof of concept, an ultrabroadband terahertz (THz) carpet cloak is experimentally demonstrated through an array of superdispersive microparticles, rendering the target object invisible to detection by both time&#8208; and frequency&#8208;domain wideband systems. The work presents a feasible invisibility strategy that is closer to practical applications and may pave a brand&#8208;new way for the development of dispersion&#8208;dominated ultrabroadband metadevices.

         <title>Chemical Vapor Deposition of High&#8208;Optical&#8208;Quality Large&#8208;Area Monolayer Janus Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>

Monolayers of Janus SeMoS with asymmetric top (Se) and bottom (S) chalcogen atomic planes with respect to the central transition metal (Mo) atoms are synthesized using a one&#8208;pot chemical vapor deposition process and its high optical quality is demonstrated by low&#8208;temperature magneto optical spectroscopy.








Abstract
One&#8208;pot chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth of large&#8208;area Janus SeMoS monolayers is reported, with the asymmetric top (Se) and bottom (S) chalcogen atomic planes with respect to the central transition metal (Mo) atoms. The formation of these 2D semiconductor monolayers takes place upon the thermodynamic&#8208;equilibrium&#8208;driven exchange of the bottom Se atoms of the initially grown MoSe2 single crystals on gold foils with S atoms. The growth process is characterized by complementary experimental techniques including Raman and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and the growth mechanisms are rationalized by first principle calculations. The remarkably high optical quality of the synthesized Janus monolayers is demonstrated by optical and magneto&#8208;optical measurements which reveal the strong exciton&#8211;phonon coupling and enable an exciton g&#8208;factor of &#8722;3.3.

         <title>Suppressing Charged Cation Antisites via Se Vapor Annealing Enables p&#8208;Type Dopability in AgBiSe2&#8211;SnSe Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AgBiSe2&#8208;based thermoelectric materials show poor p&#8208;type dopability, but an underlying mechanism remains controversial. In this work, it is revealed that charged antisites are principal hole&#8208;killer defects by density functional theory calculations, and that selenium vapor annealing is an effective strategy to effectively stabilize p&#8208;type conductivity in AgBiSe2&#8211;SnSe solid solutions.








Abstract
Cation disordering is commonly found in multinary cubic compounds, but its effect on electronic properties has been neglected because of difficulties in determining the ordered structure and defect energetics. An absence of rational understanding of the point defects present has led to poor reproducibility and uncontrolled conduction type. AgBiSe2 is a representative compound that suffers from poor reproducibility of thermoelectric properties, while the origins of its intrinsic n&#8208;type conductivity remain speculative. Here, it is demonstrated that cation disordering is facilitated by BiAg charged antisite defects in cubic AgBiSe2 which also act as a principal donor defect that greatly controls the electronic properties. Using density functional theory calculations and in situ Raman spectroscopy, how saturation annealing with selenium vapor can stabilize p&#8208;type conductivity in cubic AgBiSe2 alloyed with SnSe at high temperatures is elucidated. With stable and controlled hole concentration, a peak is observed in the weighted mobility and the density&#8208;of&#8208;states effective mass in AgBiSnSe3, implying an increased valley degeneracy in this system. These findings corroborate the importance of considering the defect energetics for exploring the dopability of ternary thermoelectric chalcogenides and engineering electronic bands by controlling self&#8208;doping.

         <title>Building a Self&#8208;Adaptive Protective Layer on Ni&#8208;Rich Layered Cathodes to Enhance the Cycle Stability of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A slide&#8208;ring polymer featuring high elasticity and self&#8208;adaptive ability is designed to improve the performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries via relieving the cracks of cathode particles and retarding parasitic interfacial side reactions during cycling.








Abstract
Layered Ni&#8208;rich lithium transition metal oxides are promising battery cathodes due to their high specific capacity, but their poor cycling stability due to intergranular cracks in secondary particles restricts their practical applications. Surface engineering is an effective strategy for improving a cathode's cycling stability, but most reported surface coatings cannot adapt to the dynamic volume changes of cathodes. Herein, a self&#8208;adaptive polymer (polyrotaxane&#8208;co&#8208;poly(acrylic acid)) interfacial layer is built on LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2. The polymer layer with a slide&#8208;ring structure exhibits high toughness and can withstand the stress caused by particle volume changes, which can prevent the cracking of particles. In addition, the slide&#8208;ring polymer acts as a physicochemical barrier that suppresses surface side reactions and alleviates the dissolution of transition metallic ions, which ensures stable cycling performance. Thus, the as&#8208;prepared cathode shows significantly improved long&#8208;term cycling stability in situations in which cracks may easily occur, especially under high&#8208;rate, high&#8208;voltage, and high&#8208;temperature conditions.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Scale Integration Design of Sn&#8211;ZnO Catalyst toward Efficient and Stable CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To increase the energy efficiency while maintaining long durability of catalysts for CO2 electroreduction to CO, a dual&#8208;scale delicate design of a non&#8208;noble Sn&#8211;ZnO active interface inserted into nanopores of high&#8208;surface&#8208;area carbon nanospheres, through d&#8208;bandwidth tuning of Sn and ZnO at the electronic scale, and local environment regulation from the nanoconfinement effect of tailored nanopores, is reported.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO is a potential sustainable strategy for alleviating CO2 emission and producing valuable fuels. In the quest to resolve its current problems of low&#8208;energy efficiency and insufficient durability, a dual&#8208;scale design strategy is proposed by implanting a non&#8208;noble active Sn&#8211;ZnO heterointerface inside the nanopores of high&#8208;surface&#8208;area carbon nanospheres (Sn&#8211;ZnO@HC). The metal d&#8208;bandwidth tuning of Sn and ZnO alters the extent of substrate&#8211;molecule orbital mixing, facilitating the breaking of the *COOH intermediate and the yield of CO. Furthermore, the confinement effect of tailored nanopores results in a beneficial pH distribution in the local environment around the Sn&#8211;ZnO nanoparticles and protects them against leaching and aggregating. Through integrating electronic and nanopore&#8208;scale control, Sn&#8211;ZnO@HC achieves a quite low potential of &#8722;0.53&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) with 91% Faradaic efficiency for CO and an ultralong stability of 240 h. This work provides proof of concept for the multiscale design of electrocatalysts.

         <title>Manipulating Offense and Defense Signaling to Fight Cold Tumors with Carrier&#8208;Free Nanoassembly of Fluorinated Prodrug and siRNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new carrier&#8208;free delivery platform consisting of doxorubicin (DOX), melittin (MPI), and anti&#8208;TOX small interfering RNA (thymocyte selection&#8208;associated high mobility group box protein, TOX) is designed as an &#8220;offense&#160;and&#160;defense&#8221; signaling manipulator to fight &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors. Such a novel system represents an accessible delivery platform and promising strategy to produce potent immune response through synergistically regulating T&#8208;cell infiltration and exhaustion.








Abstract
Chemoimmunotherapy has shown great potential to activate an immune response, but the immunosuppressive microenvironment associated with T cell exhaustion remains a challenge in cancer therapy. The proper immune&#8208;modulatory strategy to provoke a robust immune response is to simultaneously regulate T&#8208;cell exhaustion and infiltration. Here, a new kind of carrier&#8208;free nanoparticle is developed to simultaneously deliver chemotherapeutic drug (doxorubicin, DOX), cytolytic peptide (melittin, MPI), and anti&#8208;TOX small interfering RNA (thymocyte selection&#8208;associated high mobility group box protein, TOX) using a fluorinated prodrug strategy. In this way, the enhanced immunogenic cell death (ICD) induced by the combination of DOX and MPI can act as &#8220;offense&#8221; signaling to increase CD8+ T&#8208;cell infiltration, while the decreased TOX expression interfered with siTOX can serve as &#8220;defense&#8221; signaling to mitigate CD8+ T&#8208;cell exhaustion. As a result, the integration of DOX, MPI, and siTOX in such a bifunctional system produced a potent antitumor immune response in liver cancer and metastasis, making it a promising delivery platform and effective strategy for converting &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors into &#8220;hot&#8221; ones.

As a result, the integration of DOX, MPI, and siTOX in such a bifunctional system produced a potent antitumor immune response in liver cancer and metastasis, making it a promising delivery platform and effective strategy for converting &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors into &#8220;hot&#8221; ones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Ion&#8208;Sieving Janus Separator toward Planar Electrodeposition for Deeply Rechargeable Zn&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Janus separator is constructed to continuously regulate the Zn(002) planar electrodeposition on the surface of a&#160;Zn anode and provide single&#8208;ion channels for Zn2+ ions to suppress side reactions. This work provides new insights to stabilize metal anodes (e.g., Li, Na, K, Zn, Al, Ca, and Mg) in rechargeable batteries.








Abstract
The irregular and random electrodeposition of zinc has emerged as a non&#8208;negligible barrier for deeply rechargeable aqueous zinc (Zn)&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs), yet traditional texture regulation of the Zn substrate cannot continuously induce uniform Zn deposition. Here, a Janus separator is constructed via parallelly grown graphene sheets modified with sulfonic cellulose on one side of the commercial glass fiber separator through the spin&#8208;coating technique. The Janus separator can consistently regulate Zn growth toward a locked crystallographic orientation of Zn(002) texture to intercept dendrites. Furthermore, the separator can spontaneously repel SO42&#8722; and anchor H+ while allowing effective transport of Zn2+ to alleviate side reactions. Accordingly, the Zn symmetric cell harvests a long&#8208;term lifespan over 1400&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/10 mAh cm&#8722;2 and endures stable cycling over 220&#160;h even at a high depth of discharge (DOD) of 56%. The Zn/carbon nanotube (CNT)&#8211;MnO2 cell achieves an outstanding capacity retention of 95% at 1 A g&#8722;1 after 1900 cycles. Furthermore, the Zn/NH4V4O10 pouch cell with a Janus separator delivers an initial capacity of 178 mAh g&#8722;1 and a high capacity retention of 87.4% after 260 cycles. This work provides a continuous regulation approach to achieve crystallographic homogeneity of the Zn anode, which can be suitable for other metal batteries.

         <title>Optothermally Programmable Liquids with Spatiotemporal Precision and Functional Complexity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquids usually lack spatial order or self&#8208;supported shape to be compatible with precision processing or advanced functionality. Here, an optothermal strategy is reported to dynamically control phase&#8208;separated liquids with an unprecedented level of spatiotemporal addressability to realize liquid painting and liquid animation, leading to a rich variety of functions such as information encryption, payload transportation, and reaction localization.








Abstract
Due to the intrinsic lack of spatial order and self&#8208;supported shape, liquids are often incompatible with precision manufacturing/processing and are potentially limited for advanced functionality. Herein, an optothermal strategy is developed to fully command phase&#8208;separated liquids with unprecedented spatiotemporal addressability. Specifically, a laser is focused onto an Au film to create a hot spot that locally demixes a temperature&#8208;responsive solution to produce a single optothermal droplet. Spatial precision is assured by the well&#8208;defined thermal field and temporal accuracy guaranteed by the fast heating and response rate. Time&#8208;multiplexed laser foci are deployed to engineer the thermal landscape as desired, which in turn dictates the formation/dissolution, positioning, shaping, and dynamic reconfiguration of the phase&#8208;separated liquids. Further, laser foci are programmed to orchestrate the liquid patterns in a time&#8208;continuous manner to produce liquid animations on the microscale with high fidelity. While focused lasers are routinely used to manipulate solid particles or to microfabricate solid materials, the current strategy embraces the merits of liquids and features functional complexity in information encryption, payload transportation, and reaction localization. The strategy is further applicable in scenarios such as subcellular organization of biomolecular condensates and programmable modulation of non&#8208;equilibrium systems.

         <title>A Soft Magnetoelastic Generator for Wind&#8208;Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fundamentally new wind&#8208;energy&#8208;harvesting technology based on the giant magnetoelastic effect in a soft composite system is reported. Wind&#8208;induced mechanical deformation alters the magnetic field in the soft system, which is able to convert the wind energy into electricity via electromagnetic induction from arbitrary directions. It features a high current density of 1.17&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8211;2 and intrinsic waterproofness.








Abstract
The current energy crises and imminent danger of global warming severely limit the ability to scale societal development sustainably. As such, there is a pressing need for utilizing renewable, green energy sources, such as wind energy, which is ubiquitously available on Earth. In this work, a fundamentally new wind&#8208;energy&#8208;harvesting technology is reported, which is based on the giant magnetoelastic effect in a soft composite system, namely, magnetoelastic generators. Its working principle is based on wind&#8208;induced mechanical deformation, which alters the magnetic field in a soft system converting the&#160;wind energy into electricity via electromagnetic induction from arbitrary directions. The wind&#8208;energy&#8208;harvesting system features a low internal impedance of 68&#8201;&#937;, a high current density of 1.17&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8211;2, and a power density of 0.82&#8201;mW&#8201;cm&#8211;2 under ambient natural wind. The system is capable of sustainably driving small electronics and electrolytically splitting water. The system can generate hydrogen at a rate of 7.5&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8211;2&#8201;mL&#8201;h&#8211;1 with a wind speed of 20&#8201;m&#8201;s&#8722;1. Additionally, since magnetic fields can penetrate water molecules, the magnetoelastic generators are intrinsically waterproof and work stably in harsh environments. This work paves a new way for wind&#8208;energy harvesting with compelling features, which can contribute largely to the hydrogen economy and the sustainability of human civilization.

         <title>Crystalline Lattice&#8208;Confined Atomic Pt in Metal Carbides to Match Electronic Structures and Hydrogen Evolution Behaviors of Platinum</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Platinum&#8208;based catalysts occupy a pivotal position in diverse catalytic applications in hydrogen chemistry and electrochemistry, for instance, the hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). While adsorbed Pt atoms on supports often cause severe mismatching on electronic structures and HER behaviors from metallic Pt due to the different energy level distribution of electron orbitals. Here, we report the design of crystalline lattice&#8208;confined atomic Pt in metal carbides using the Pt&#8208;centered polyoxometalate frameworks with strong Pt&#8208;O&#8208;metal covalent bonds. Remarkably, the lattice&#8208;confined atomic Pt in the tungsten carbides (Ptdoped@WCx, both Pt and W have atomic radii of 1.3 &#197;) exhibit near&#8208;zero valence states and similar electronic structures as metallic Pt, thus delivering matched energy level distributions of the Pt 5dz2 and H 1s orbitals and similar acidic hydrogen evolution behaviors. In alkaline conditions, the Ptdoped@WCx exhibits 40 times greater mass activity (49.5 A mgPt&#8722;1 at &#414; = 150&#160;mV) than the Pt@C because of the favorable water dissociation and H* transport. These findings offer a new and universal pathway to construct urgently needed atomic&#8208;scale catalysts for broad catalytic reactions.

         <title>Harnessing Polymer&#8208;Matrix&#8208;Mediated Manipulation of Intermolecular Charge&#8208;Transfer for Near&#8208;Infrared Security Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via regulation of the intermolecular interaction between TTF and TCNB in the polymer network, a charge&#8208;transfer complex&#160;(CTC)&#160;filter shows tunable absorption from the visible to NIR region with a relatively high penetration of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) radiation (&#8776;80%). The CTC filter can highlight NIR information hidden in a complex environment, providing a convenient tool for different security applications.








Abstract
Precise recognition of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) signals holds great prospects in optical communication, remote sensing, information security, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. For these applications, filters with good NIR transparency are typically essential components. Currently, such NIR transparent filters are dominated by inorganic materials such as chalcogenide glasses. There are, so far, only a handful of organic molecules with suitable optical properties due to the rarity of organic materials with good NIR transparency and relatively flat absorption over the UV&#8211;visible region. Here, it is found that the library of NIR&#8208;transparent organic materials can be expanded by forming a charge&#8208;transfer complex (CTC) between a donor (D) and an acceptor (A) molecule&#160;that are commercially available. Via regulating the D&#63743;A interaction, the CTC filter shows tunable absorption from the visible to NIR region with a relatively high penetration of NIR radiation (&#8776;80%). The CTC filter can successfully highlight NIR information hidden in a complex environment and allow reading of NIR security images for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Moreover, the CTC filter can be used for viewing protected NIR information with good resolution, and thus provide a convenient tool for different security applications using NIR&#8208;encoded information.

         <title>A Novel 19$\sqrt {19} $ &#215; 19$\sqrt {19} $ Superstructure in Epitaxially Grown 1T&#8208;TaTe2</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel 19&#215;19$\sqrt {19} \times \sqrt {19} $ charge order is observed in few&#8208;layer thick 1T&#8208;TaTe2 films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. The photoemission and scanning probe measurements demonstrate that monolayer 1T&#8208;TaTe2 exhibits various metastable charge density wave orders, including the 19&#215;19$\sqrt {19} \times \sqrt {19} $ superstructure, which can be selectively stabilized by postgrowth annealing. In 1T&#8208;TaTe2 films thicker than a monolayer, only the 19&#215;19$\sqrt {19} \times \sqrt {19} $ order persists.








Abstract
The spontaneous formation of electronic orders is a crucial element for understanding complex quantum states and engineering heterostructures in 2D materials. A novel 19$\sqrt {19} $ &#215;19$\sqrt {19} $ charge order in few&#8208;layer&#8208;thick 1T&#8208;TaTe2 transition metal dichalcogenide films grown by molecular beam epitaxy, which has not been realized, is report. The photoemission and scanning probe measurements demonstrate that monolayer 1T&#8208;TaTe2 exhibits a variety of metastable charge density wave orders, including the 19$\sqrt {19} $ &#215; 19$\sqrt {19} $ superstructure, which can be selectively stabilized by controlling the post&#8208;growth annealing temperature. Moreover, it is found that only the 19$\sqrt {19} $ &#215; 19$\sqrt {19} $ order persists in 1T&#8208;TaTe2 films thicker than a monolayer, up to 8 layers. The findings identify the previously unrealized novel electronic order in a much&#8208;studied transition metal dichalcogenide and provide a viable route to control it within the epitaxial growth process.

         <title>Enhanced competition at the nano&#8208;bio interface enables comprehensive characterization of protein corona dynamics and deep coverage of proteomes</title>

Abstract
Introducing engineered nanoparticles (NPs) into a biofluid such as blood plasma leads to the formation of a selective and reproducible protein corona at the particle&#8208;protein interface, driven by the relationship between protein&#8208;NP affinity and protein abundance. We have developed a scalable system that leverages protein&#8208;nano interactions to overcome current limitations of deep plasma proteomics in large cohorts. Here we demonstrate the importance of the protein to NP&#8208;surface ratio (P/NP) and model protein corona formation dynamics, which determine the competition between proteins for binding. Tuning the P/NP ratio significantly modulates protein corona composition, enhancing depth and precision of a fully automated NP&#8208;based deep proteomic workflow (Proteograph &#8482;). By increasing the binding competition on engineered NPs, we identify 1.2 &#8211; 1.7&#215; more proteins with only 1% false discovery rate on the surface of each NP, and up to 3&#215; compared to a standard plasma proteomics workflow. Moreover, our data suggests P/NP plays a significant role in determining the in vivo fate of nanomaterials in biomedical applications. Together, our study showcases the importance of P/NP as a key design element for biomaterials and nanomedicine in vivo and as a powerful tuning strategy for accurate, large&#8208;scale NP&#8208;based deep proteomic studies

         <title>An Irradiance&#8208;Adaptable Near&#8208;Infrared Vertical Heterojunction Phototransistor</title>

Abstract
Bioinspired artificial visual perception devices with the optical environment&#8208;adaptable function have attracted significant attention for their promising potential in applications like robotics and machine vision. In this regard, a photodetector with in&#8208;sensor adaptability is longed for in terms of complexity, efficiency, and cost. Here, a near&#8208;infrared phototransistor with a benign light irradiance&#8208;adaptability is presented. The phototransistor uses a vertically stacking graphene/lead sulfide quantum dots/graphene heterojunction as the conductive channel. Compared with ordinary lead sulfide quantum dots&#8208;decorated graphene phototransistors, the present device demonstrates a faster photoresponse speed and an abnormal transfer characteristic. The latter characteristic is induced by the gate voltage tunable Fermi level in the heterojunction and the abundant electron trap states in the quantum dot film, which jointly results in an intense dependence of the photoresponse on the gate voltage. The dynamic trapping and de&#8208;trapping processes in the quantum dot film enable the inhabitation or potentiation of the photoresponse, based on which the photopic or scotopic adaptation behavior of the human retina is successfully mimicked, respectively. By providing an irradiance&#8208;adaptable photodetector with a spectral response beyond visible light, this work should inspire future research on artificial environment&#8208;adaptable perception devices.

         <title>Zinc Ion Battery Typed Self&#8208;Powered Pressure Sensor with Long Service Life</title>

Abstract
Accurate and continuous pressure signal detection without external power supply is a key technology to realize the miniaturization of wearable electronic equipment, the internet of things and artificial intelligence. However, it is difficult to be achieved by using current sensor technologies. Here we report a new one&#8208;body strategy, i.e., zinc ion battery pressure (ZIB&#8208;P) sensor technology, which designs the rechargeable solid&#8208;state zinc ion battery itself as a flexible pressure sensor. In the device, an isolation layer is introduced into the sandwich configuration solid&#8208;state battery to realize the change of device internal resistance by pressure during the transformation of the mechanical signal to the electrical signal. This battery pressure sensor possesses good flexibility, fast response/recovery time (76.0/88.0&#160;ms), stable long&#8208;term response, excellent cycle stability (100000 times) and wide pressure detection range (2.0 Pa&#8722;3.68&#215;105&#160;Pa). Especially, the excellent charge&#8208;discharge performance in the ZIB&#8208;P sensor endows it with the real&#8208;time detection ability of human vital signs (pulse and limb movement, etc.) and ultrahigh stability without degradation even under 100000 times pressure stimulation. The ZIB&#8208;P sensor strategy provides a new solution for the future development of miniaturized wearable electronic devices.

         <title>A Peritumorally Injected Immunomodulating Adjuvant Elicits Robust and Safe Metalloimmunotherapy Against Solid Tumors</title>

Abstract
Clinical immunotherapy of solid tumors elicits durable responses only in a minority of patients, largely due to the highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Although rational combinations of vaccine adjuvants with inflammatory cytokines or immune agonists that relieve immunosuppression represent an appealing therapeutic strategy against solid tumors, there is unavoidable non&#8208;specific toxicities due to the pleiotropy of cytokines and undesired activation of off&#8208;target cells. Herein, we report a Zn2+ doped layered double hydroxide (Zn&#8208;LDH) based immunomodulating adjuvant, which not only relieves immunosuppression but also elicits robust antitumor immunity. Peritumorally injected Zn&#8208;LDH sustainably neutralizes acidic TME and releases abundant Zn2+, promoting a pro&#8208;inflammatory network composed of M1&#8208;tumor&#8208;associated macrophages, cytotoxic T cells and natural&#8208;killer cells. Moreover, the Zn&#8208;LDH internalized by tumor cells effectively disrupts endo&#8208;/lysosomes to block autophagy and induces mitochondrial damage, and the released Zn2+ activates the cGas&#8208;STING signaling pathway to induce immunogenic cell death, which further promotes the release of tumor&#8208;associated antigens to induce antigen&#8208;specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Unprecedentedly, merely injection of Zn&#8208;LDH adjuvant, without using any cytotoxic inflammatory cytokines or immune agonists, significantly inhibits the growth, recurrence, and metastasis of solid tumors in mice. Our study provides a rational bottom&#8208;up design of potent adjuvant for cancer metalloimmunotherapy against solid tumors.

         <title>Zn&#8208;MOFs Derived Ordered Mesoporous Carbon&#8208;based Nanostructure for High&#8208;performance and Universal Multivalent Metal Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) derivatives promise great potential in energy storage and conversion because of their excellent tunability in both the active metal sites, organic links and the overall structures down to atomic and up to mesoscale. Nevertheless, a big challenge is to precisely control and thoroughly understand the actual MOF&#8208;to&#8208;derivative conversion process to realize the template&#8208;free synthesis of the MOFs derived ordered mesoporous materials. Here, we present a class of ordered mesoporous N&#8208;doped carbon nanoflakes with slit&#8208;shaped pores synthesized by one&#8208;step pyrolysis of Zn1Cux&#8208;MOF, where the Cu&#8208;doping plays a critically important direction&#8208;inducing function on the dissociation of organic ligands during the pyrolysis. Benefiting from the uniquely ordered mesoporous structure and large specific surface area (910 m2 g&#8211;1), the Zn1Cux&#8208;MOF derived ordered mesoporous carbon nanoflakes present outstanding electrochemical storage performance for multivalent metal ions, such as Mg2+, Ca2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Al3+, and Zn2+, demonstrating the universal nature of the slit&#8208;shaped pores in enabling the multivalent metal ions for energy storage. Moreover, the assembled flexible Zn ion hybrid supercapacitor (ZHSC) delivers a high specific capacity of 134 mAh g&#8211;1 at 0.5 A g&#8211;1, excellent cycling and mechanical stability, showing great application potential in the new generation energy storage devices.

         <title>Collective Behaviors of Active Matter Learning from Natural Taxes Across Scales</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Taxis orientation is common in microorganisms, and it provides feasible strategies to operate active colloids as small&#8208;scale robots. Collective taxes involve numerous units that collectively perform taxis motion, whereby the collective cooperation between individuals enables the group to perform efficiently, adaptively, and robustly. Hence, analyzing and designing collectives is crucial for developing and advancing microswarm toward practical or clinical applications. In this review, natural taxis behaviors are categorized and synthetic microrobotic collectives are discussed as bio&#8208;inspired realizations, aiming at closing the gap between taxis strategies of living creatures and those of functional active microswarms. As collective behaviors emerge within a group, the global taxis to external stimuli guides the group to conduct overall tasks, whereas the local taxis between individuals induces weak synchronization and global patterns. By encoding the local orientations and programming the global stimuli, various paradigms can be introduced for coordinating and controlling such collective microrobots, from the viewpoints of fundamental science and practical applications. Therefore, by discussing the key points and difficulties associated with collective taxes of different paradigms, this review potentially offers insights into mimicking natural collective behaviors and constructing intelligent microrobotic systems for on&#8208;demand control and pre&#8208;assigned&#160;tasks.

         <title>A Meta&#8208;device for Intelligent Depth Perception</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The optical illusion affects depth&#8208;sensing due to the limited and specific light&#8208;field information acquired by single&#8208;lens imaging. The incomplete depth information or visual deception would cause cognitive errors. To resolve this problem, we demonstrate an intelligent and compact depth&#8208;sensing meta&#8208;device that is miniaturized, integrated, and applicable for diverse scenes in all light levels. The compact and multifunction stereo vision system adopts an array with 3600 achromatic meta&#8208;lenses and a size of 1.2 &#215; 1.2 mm2 to measure the depth over a 30&#160;cm range with deep&#8208;learning support. The meta&#8208;lens array can act as multiple imaging lenses to collect light field information. It can also work with a light source as an active optical device to project a structured light. The meta&#8208;lens array could serve as the core functional component of a light&#8208;field imaging system under bright conditions or a structured&#8208;light projection system in the dark. The depth information in both ways can be analyzed and extracted by the convolutional neural network. This work provides a new avenue for the applications such as autonomous driving, machine vision, human&#8208;computer interaction, augmented reality, biometric identification, etc.

         <title>Construction of Ultrathin S&#8208;scheme Heterojunctions of Single Ni Atom&#8208;immobilized Ti&#8208;MOF and BiVO4 for CO2 Photoconversion nearly 100% to CO by Pure Water</title>

Abstract
To rationally design single&#8208;atom MOF&#8208;involved photocatalysts remains an ongoing challenge for efficient CO2 conversion. Here, we exploit the cuppy microstructures, consisting of Ti(IV)&#8208;oxo node and three linked carboxylic moieties, in single&#8208;coordination&#8208;layer Ti2(H2dobdc)3 MOF (NTU&#8208;9) to immobilize abundant single Ni(II) sites (Ni@MOF). The coupling of Ni@MOF with BiVO4 (BVO) nanosheets by H&#8208;bonding&#8208;induced assembly process obtains wide&#8208;spectrum two&#8208;dimension heterojunctions. Optimal heterojunction exhibits competitive performance and enables around 66&#8208;fold CO2 conversion of that for BVO nanoparticles by pure water, with nearly 100% CO selectivity. The exceptional photoactivity is attributed to favorable S&#8208;scheme charge transfer from BVO to MOF then to single Ni(II) sites. Noteworthily, single Ni(II) sites anchored by Ti(IV)&#8208;oxo node and vicinal carboxylic moieties serving as unique local microenvironment (LME) are found to synergistically catalyze CO2 conversion. Specifically, the hydroxyl groups of carboxylic moieties can form H&#8208;bonds with CO2 to promote its adsorption on single Ni(II) sites, and also can provide accessible protons to facilitate H&#8208;assisted CO2 reduction. Moreover, the CO desorption and subsequent CO2 adsorption on single Ni(II) sites with LME is proved thermodynamically favored hence dominates high CO selectivity. This work highlights the significance of modulating the LME of single atoms to rationally design photocatalysts for realizing carbon neutralization.

         <title>Charge Transport in Twisted Organic Semiconductor Crystals of Modulated Pitch</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of temperature&#8208;dependent, growth&#8208;induced twisting of crystallites of a monocomponent organic semiconductor, 2,5&#8208;bis(3&#8208;dodecyl&#8208;2&#8208;thienyl)&#8208;thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole (BDT), on charge mobility is analyzed. Organic field&#8208;effect transistor measurements and electrical potential simulation suggest that the twisting&#8208;enhanced mobility is mainly controlled by the organization of fibers in the film, not their individual forms.








Abstract
Many molecular crystals (approximately one third) grow as twisted, helicoidal ribbons from the melt, and this preponderance is even higher in restricted classes of materials, for instance, charge&#8208;transfer complexes. Previously, twisted crystallites of such complexes present an increase in carrier mobilities. Here, the effect of twisting on charge mobility is better analyzed for a monocomponent organic semiconductor, 2,5&#8208;bis(3&#8208;dodecyl&#8208;2&#8208;thienyl)&#8208;thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole (BDT), that forms twisted crystals with varied helicoidal pitches and makes possible a correlation of twist strength with carrier mobility. Films are analyzed by X&#8208;ray scattering and Mueller matrix polarimetry to characterize the microscale organization of the polycrystalline ensembles. Carrier mobilities of organic field&#8208;effect transistors are five times higher when the crystals are grown with the smallest pitches (most twisted), compared to those with the largest pitches, along the fiber elongation direction. A tenfold increase is observed along the perpendicular direction. Simulation of electrical potential based on scanning electron microscopy images and density functional theory suggests that the twisting&#8208;enhanced mobility is mainly controlled by the fiber organization in the film. A greater number of tightly packed twisted fibers separated by numerous smaller gaps permit better charge transport over the film surface compared to fewer big crystallites separated by larger gaps.

         <title>Responsive Hydrogels Based on Triggered Click Reactions for Liver Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cross&#8208;linked hydrophilic polymer chains that can form gels are widely utilized for biomedical applications, such as drug delivery. Various studies have also demonstrated the effects of particle size and surface morphology on drug release from particles in liver cancer therapy. Mechanistic understandings of responsive hydrogels in responsive stimuli are provided, by which better clinical choices may be approached.








Abstract
Globally, liver cancer, which is one of the major cancers worldwide, has attracted the growing attention of technological researchers for its high mortality and limited treatment options. Hydrogels are soft 3D network materials containing a large number of hydrophilic monomers. By adding moieties such as nitrobenzyl groups to the network structure of a cross&#8208;linked nanocomposite hydrogel, the click reaction improves drug&#8208;release efficiency in vivo, which improves the survival rate and prolongs the survival time of liver cancer patients. The application of a nanocomposite hydrogel drug delivery system can not only enrich the drug concentration at the tumor site for a long time but also effectively prevents the distant metastasis of residual tumor cells. At present, a large number of researches have been working toward the construction of responsive nanocomposite hydrogel drug delivery systems, but there are few comprehensive articles to systematically summarize these discoveries. Here, this systematic review summarizes the synthesis methods and related applications of nanocomposite responsive hydrogels with actions to external or internal physiological stimuli. With different physical or chemical stimuli, the structural unit rearrangement and the controlled release of drugs can be used for responsive drug delivery in different states.

         <title>Engineering the Ni&#63743;N&#63743;C Catalyst Microenvironment Enabling CO2 Electroreduction with Nearly 100% CO Selectivity in Acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The working microenvironment of electrocatalysts influences the activity and selectivity. In this work, the working microenvironment of a structurally engineered Ni&#63743;N&#63743;C catalyst for acidic CO2 electrolysis is probed and optimized by adding hydrophobic poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) nanoparticles in the catalytic layer of a gas&#8208;diffusion electrode. The PTFE&#8208;modified electrode displays substantially decreased overpotential, nearly 100% CO selectivity, and outstanding water&#8208;flooding&#8208;resistant ability.








Abstract
CO2 electrolysis in acid has emerged as a promising route to achieve high CO2 utilization due to the inhibition of undesired carbonate formation that generally occurs in alkaline or neutral conditions. However, the efficiency and stability of this system need to be further improved through tailoring of the electrocatalyst and its working environment. Here, a working microenvironment of structurally engineered Ni&#63743;N&#63743;C catalyst for acidic CO2 electrolysis is probed and optimized by adding hydrophobic poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) nanoparticles in the catalytic layer of gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes. The PTFE&#8208;modified electrode delivers nearly 100% CO Faradaic efficiency at an industry&#8208;relevant current density of 250&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and a high single&#8208;pass CO2 utilization of 75.7% at a current density of 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 under 20 sccm CO2 gas flow rate. Moreover, compared to a conventional electrode without added PTFE, the PTFE&#8208;modified electrode exhibits a substantially enhanced water&#8208;flooding&#8208;resistant ability. Mechanistic investigations reveal that a moderate PTFE modification can optimize the local CO2/H2O ratio in the catalytic layer, favoring the reduction of the diffusion layer thickness and the formation of a highly active and stable solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;gas interfacial microenvironment.

         <title>Thermal&#8208;Radiation&#8208;Driven Ultrafast Crystallization of Perovskite Films Under Heavy Humidity for Efficient Inverted Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fabricating high&#8208;quality perovskite film in the ambient air is significantly important for upcoming commercial production. Here, the perovskite crystallization process by a two&#8208;step sequential solution deposition in a glovebox and air is systematically studied. Thermal&#8208;radiation&#8208;assisted ultrafast conversion from the intermediates to perovskite is demonstrated, and a comparable performance for the device from the glovebox is acheived.








Abstract
Fabricating perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in air is conducive to low&#8208;cost commercial production; nevertheless, it is rather difficult to achieve comparable device performance as that in an inert atmosphere because of the poor moisture toleration of perovskite materials. Here, the perovskite crystallization process is systematically studied using two&#8208;step sequential solution deposition in an inert atmosphere (glovebox) and air. It is found that moisture can stabilize solvation intermediates and prevent their conversion into perovskite crystals. To address this issue, thermal radiation is used to accelerate perovskite crystallization for integrated perovskite films within 10&#160;s in air. The as&#8208;formed perovskite films are compact, highly oriented with giant grain size, superior photoelectric properties, and low trap density. When the films are applied to PSC devices, a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.8% is obtained, one of the best results for air&#8208;processed inverted PSCs under high relative humidity (60&#160;&#177;&#160;10%). This work substantially assists understanding and modulation to perovskite crystallization kinetics under heavy humidity. Also, the ultrafast conversion strategy by thermal radiation&#160;provides unprecedented opportunities to manufacture high&#8208;quality perovskite films for low&#8208;temperature, eco&#8208;friendly, and air&#8208;processed efficient inverted PSCs.

         <title>MoSe2&#8208;VSe2&#8208;NbSe2 Ternary Alloy Nanosheets to Boost Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Alloying of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is a pioneering method for engineering electronic structures with expanded applications. In this study, MoSe2&#8208;VSe2&#8208;NbSe2 ternary alloy nanosheets were synthesized via a colloidal reaction. The composition was successfully tuned over a wide range to adjust the 2H&#8208;1T phase transition. The alloy nanosheets consisted of miscible atomic structures at all compositions, which is distinct from the immiscible binary alloys. Compared to each binary alloy, the ternary alloys displayed higher electrocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an acidic electrolyte. The HER performance exhibited a volcano&#8208;type composition dependence, which is correlated with the experimental d&#8208;band center. Spin&#8208;polarized density functional theory calculations consistently predicted the homogenous atomic distributions. The Gibbs free energy of H adsorption and the activation barrier support that miscible ternary alloying greatly enhances the HER performance.

In this study, MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-VSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-NbSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ternary alloy nanosheets were synthesized via a colloidal reaction. The composition was successfully tuned over a wide range to adjust the 2H-1T phase transition. The alloy nanosheets consisted of miscible atomic structures at all compositions, which is distinct from the immiscible binary alloys. Compared to each binary alloy, the ternary alloys displayed higher electrocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an acidic electrolyte. The HER performance exhibited a volcano-type composition dependence, which is correlated with the experimental &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-band center. Spin-polarized density functional theory calculations consistently predicted the homogenous atomic distributions. The Gibbs free energy of H adsorption and the activation barrier support that miscible ternary alloying greatly enhances the HER performance.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Fully Textured, Production&#8208;line Compatible Monolithic Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells Approaching 29% Efficiency</title>

Abstract
Perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells are promising avenues for achieving high&#8208;performance photovoltaics with low costs. However, the highest certified efficiency of perovskite/silicon tandem devices based on economically matured silicon heterojunction technology (HJT) with fully textured wafer was only 25.2% due to incompatibility between the limitation of fabrication technology which was not compatible with the production&#8208;line silicon wafer. Here, we develop a molecular&#8208;level nanotechnology by designing NiOx/2PACz ([2&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) ethyl]phosphonic acid) as a ultrathin hybrid hole transport layer above ITO recombination junction, to serve as a vital pivot for achieving a conformal deposition of high&#8208;quality perovskite layer on top. The NiOx interlayer facilitates a uniform self&#8208;assembly of 2PACz molecules onto the fully textured surface, thus avoiding direct contact between ITO and perovskite top&#8208;cell for a minimal shunt loss. As a result of such interfacial engineering, the fully textured perovskite/silicon tandem cells obtain a certified efficiency of 28.84% on a 1.2&#8208;cm2 masked area, which is the highest performance to date based on the fully textured, production&#8208;line compatible HJT. This work advances commercially promising photovoltaics with high performance and low costs by adopting a meticulously designed HTL/perovskite interface.

         <title>Nondestructive photopatterning of heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free quantum dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electroluminescence from quantum dots (QDs) is a suitable photon source for futuristic displays offering hyper&#8208;realistic images with free&#8208;form factors. Accordingly, a nondestructive and scalable process capable of rendering multicolored QD patterns on a scale of several micrometers needs to be established. Here, we report nondestructive direct photopatterning for heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free QDs using branched light&#8208;driven ligand crosslinkers (LiXers) containing multiple azide units. The branched LiXers effectively interlock QD films via photocrosslinking native aliphatic QD surface ligands without compromising the intrinsic optoelectronic properties of QDs. Using branched LiXers with six sterically engineered azide units, we achieved RGB QD patterns on the micrometer scale. The photocrosslinking process did not affect the photoluminescence and electroluminescence characteristics of QDs and extended the device lifetime. This nondestructive method can be readily adapted to industrial processes and make an immediate impact on display technologies, as it uses widely available photolithography facilities and high&#8208;quality heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free QDs with aliphatic ligands.

         <title>Universal Hopping Motion Protected by Structural Topology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A scaling law elucidates the universality in nature, presiding over many physical phenomena which seem unrelated. Thus, exploring the universality class of scaling law in a particular system enlightens its physical nature in relevance to other systems and sometimes unearths an unprecedented new dynamic phase. Here, we investigate the dynamics of weakly driven magnetic skyrmions and compare its scaling law with the motion of a magnetic domain wall (DW) creep. We find that the skyrmion does not follow the scaling law of the DW creep in 2&#8208;dimensional space but instead shows a hopping behavior similar to that of the particle&#8208;like DW in 1&#8208;dimensional confinement. In addition, the hopping law satisfies even when a topological charge of the skyrmion is removed. Therefore, the distinct scaling behavior between the magnetic skyrmion and the DW stems from a general principle beyond the topological charge. We demonstrate that the hopping behavior of skyrmions originates from the bottleneck process induced by DW segments with diverging collective lengths, which is inevitable in any closed&#8208;shape spin structure in 2&#8208;dimension. This work reveals that the structural topology of magnetic texture determines the universality class of its weakly driven motion, which is distinguished from the universality class of magnetic DW creep.

Here, we investigate the dynamics of weakly driven magnetic skyrmions and compare its scaling law with the motion of a magnetic domain wall (DW) creep. We find that the skyrmion does not follow the scaling law of the DW creep in 2-dimensional space but instead shows a hopping behavior similar to that of the particle-like DW in 1-dimensional confinement. In addition, the hopping law satisfies even when a topological charge of the skyrmion is removed. Therefore, the distinct scaling behavior between the magnetic skyrmion and the DW stems from a general principle beyond the topological charge. We demonstrate that the hopping behavior of skyrmions originates from the bottleneck process induced by DW segments with diverging collective lengths, which is inevitable in any closed-shape spin structure in 2-dimension.

         <title>Engineered Bacterial Outer Membrane Vesicles as Controllable Two&#8208;way Adaptors to Activate Macrophage Phagocytosis for Improved Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The most immune cells infiltrating tumor microenvironment (TME), tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) closely resemble immunosuppressive M2&#8208;polarized macrophages. Moreover, tumor cells exhibit high expression of CD47 &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal, which obstructs macrophage phagocytosis. The precise and efficient activation of TAMs is a promising approach to tumor immunotherapy; however re&#8208;education of macrophages remain a challenge. Bacteria&#8208;derived outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are highly immunogenic nanovesicles that can robustly stimulate macrophages. Here, we report an OMV&#8208;based controllable two&#8208;way adaptor, in which a CD47 nanobody (CD47nb) was fused onto OMV surface (OMV&#8208;CD47nb), with the outer surface coated with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) layer containing diselenide bonds (PEG/Se) to form PEG/Se@OMV&#8208;CD47nb. The PEG/Se layer modification not only mitigated the immunogenicity of OMV&#8208;CD47nb, thereby remarkedly increasing the dose that could be administered safely through intravenous injection, but also equipped the formulation with radiation&#8208;triggered controlled release of OMV&#8208;CD47nb. Application of radiation to tumors in mice injected with the nanoformulation resulted in remodeling of TME. As two&#8208;way adaptors, OMV&#8208;CD47nb activated TAM phagocytosis of tumor cells via multiple pathways, including induction of M1 polarization and blockade of &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal. Moreover, this activation of TAMs resulted in the stimulation of T cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity through effective antigen presentation.

         <title>Crossover Effects in Lithium&#8208;metal Batteries with a Localized High Concentration Electrolyte and High&#8208;nickel Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
While crossover effects, such as transition&#8208;metal dissolution, are well&#8208;understood in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, there is a limited understanding of the effect of crossed&#8208;over chemical species in cells with oxide cathodes and lithium&#8208;metal anodes. In this work, the effects of cathode&#8208;to&#8208;anode and anode&#8208;to&#8208;cathode crossover are explored in cells with a high&#8208;nickel cathode, lithium&#8208;metal anode, and a localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE). Dramatic differences are found among cells; a lithium&#8208;metal anode paired with a high&#8208;nickel cathode has three times less solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) growth than a lithium&#8208;metal anode paired with lithium metal. Meanwhile, the cathode paired with lithium metal has 2 &#8211; 3 times higher capacity fade than the same cathode paired with graphite. Decomposition and crossover of the FSI salt is identified as the main source of these changes. The fluorine in the salt is first stripped off at the lithium&#8208;metal anode, and the remaining sulfur and nitrogen cross over to the cathode. Although the reduction in fluorine content harms the surface stability of the cathode, the lithium&#8208;metal anode benefits from the increased fluorine content. Because the lithium&#8208;metal anode is typically the bottleneck for cells with thin lithium, crossover is a major factor in the enhanced performance of lithium&#8208;metal batteries with LHCE.

         <title>Priority and Prospect of Sulfide&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Membrane</title>

Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) employing sulfide solid electrolytes (SEs) promise sustainable energy storage systems with energy&#8208;dense integration and critical intrinsic safety, yet they still require cost&#8208;effective manufacturing and the integration of thin membrane&#8208;based SE separators into large&#8208;format cells to achieve scalable deployment. In this review, based on an overview of sulfide SE materials, we expound on why implementing a thin membrane&#8208;based separator is the priority for mass production of ASSLBs and identify critical criteria for capturing a high&#8208;quality thin sulfide SE membrane. Moreover, from the aspects of material availability, membrane processing, and cell integration, we describe the major challenges and associated strategies to meet these criteria throughout the whole manufacturing chain to provide a realistic assessment of the current status of sulfide SE membranes. Finally, future directions and prospects for scalable and manufacturable sulfide SE membranes for ASSLBs are presented.

         <title>A pH&#8208;Responsive Cluster Metal&#8208;organic Framework Nanoparticle for Enhanced Tumor Accumulation and Antitumor Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
As a result of the deficient tumor&#8208;specific antigens, potential off&#8208;target effect, and influence of protein corona, the metal&#8208;organic framework nanoparticles have inadequate accumulation in the tumor tissues, limiting the therapeutic effects. In this work, a pH&#8208;responsive linker (L) is prepared by covalently modifying oleylamine (OA) with 3&#8208;(bromomethyl)&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;furandione (MMfu) and poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG). Then, the L is embedded into a solid lipid nano&#8208;shell to coat apilimod (Ap)&#8208;loaded zeolitic imidazolate framework (Ap&#8208;ZIF) to form Ap&#8208;ZIF@SLN#L. Under the tumor microenvironment, the hydrophilic PEG and MMfu are removed, exposing the hydrophobic OA on Ap&#8208;ZIF@SLN#L, increasing their uptake in cancer cells and accumulation in the tumor. ZIF@SLN#L nanoparticle induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). Ap released from Ap&#8208;ZIF@SLN#L significantly promoted intracellular ROS and lactate dehydrogenase generation. Ap&#8208;ZIF@SLN#L inhibited tumor growth, increased the survival rate in mice, activated the tumor microenvironment, and improved the infiltration of macrophages and T cells in the tumor, as demonstrated in two different tumor&#8208;bearing mice after injections with Ap&#8208;ZIF@SLN#TL. Furthermore, mice showed normal physiological responses of the main organs and the normal serum level in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase after treatment with the nanoparticles. Overall, this pH&#8208;responsive targeting strategy improves nanoparticle accumulation in tumors with enhanced therapeutic effects.

         <title>Integrated Ideal&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite/Bulk&#8208;Heterojunction Solar Cells with Efficiencies &gt; 24%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Here, we report a highly efficient integrated ideal&#8208;bandgap perovskite/bulk&#8208;heterojunction solar cell (IPBSC) with an inverted architecture, featuring the near infrared (NIR) polymer DTBTI based bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) layer atop guanidinium bromide (GABr)&#8208;modified FA0.7MA0.3Pb0.7Sn0.3I3 perovskite film as the photoactive layer. The IPBSC shows cascade&#8208;like energy level alignment between charge&#8208;extraction&#8208;layer/perovskite/BHJ and efficient passivation effect of BHJ on perovskite. Thanks to the well&#8208;matched energy level alignment and high&#8208;quality ideal bandgap&#8208;based perovskite film, an efficient charge transfer occurs between the charge&#8208;extraction&#8208;layer/perovskite/BHJ. Moreover, the NIR polymer DTBTI on the perovskite film leads to an improved NIR light response for the IPBSC. In addition, the O, S and N atoms in the DTBTI polymer yield a strong interaction with perovskite, which is conducive to reducing the defects of the perovskite and suppressing charge recombination. As a result, the solar cell achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.27% (certificated value at 23.4% with 0.283&#8208;volt voltage loss), currently the recorded efficiency for both IPBSCs and Pb&#8208;Sn alloyed PSCs, and which is over the highest efficiency of perovskite&#8211;organic tandem solar cell. Moreover, the thermal, humidity and long&#8208;term operational stabilities of the IPBSCs have also been significantly improved compared with the control PSCs. Especially, the optimized IPBSC device retains 90% of the original efficiency under continuous illumination for 1000&#160;h with maximum power point (MPP) tracking in nitrogen&#8208;filled test box. This work provides a novel but simple and cost&#8208;effective strategy to close or even break the Shockley&#8208;Queisser limit.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;scale Observation of Grain Boundary Dominated Unsynchronized Phase Transition in Polycrystalline Cu2Se</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Phase transition is a physical phenomenon that attracts great interest of researchers. Although the theory of second&#8208;order phase transition is well&#8208;established, their atomic&#8208;scale dynamics in polycrystalline materials remains elusive. In this work, second&#8208;order phase transitions in polycrystalline Cu2Se at the transition temperature are directly observed by in&#8208;situ aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy. Phase transitions in microcrystalline Cu2Se start at the grain boundaries and extend inside the grains. This phenomenon is more pronounced in nano&#8208;sized grains. Analysis of phase transitions in nanocrystalline Cu2Se with different grain boundaries demonstrates that grain boundary energy dominates unsynchronized phase transition behavior. This suggests that the energy of grain boundaries is the key factor influencing the energetic barrier for initiation of phase transition. Our findings advance atomic&#8208;scale understanding of second&#8208;order phase transitions, which is crucial for the control of this process in polycrystalline materials.

         <title>Structural Reconstruction of Catalysts in Electroreduction Reaction: Identifying, Understanding, and Manipulating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fundamental insights of the structural reconstruction in electroreduction catalysts is illustrated. Special attention is paid to efficient strategies to design satisfactory cathodic catalysts including the modulation of its component and morphological features for resolving the internal inducements, the regulation of the electrolytes, gas atmosphere, and potential for resisting the external inducements.








Abstract
Electroreduction transformation of small molecules (CO2, N2, and H2O) into chemical feedstocks offers a promising approach to eliminate carbon emissions and harness renewable energy. Most cathodic catalysts often undergo structural transformation under operating electroreduction conditions. These structural reconstructions are reflected in changes in their catalytic activity. In&#8208;depth understanding of the change of active sites and influence parameters of reconstruction behaviors is an essential precondition for the design of highly efficient catalysts. Despite the previous achievements, comprehensive insight toward the structural evolution mechanism in cathodic catalysts, compared to anode ones, under reaction conditions is still lacking. Herein, an overview of structural reconstruction for cathodic catalysts in terms of fundamental mechanisms, reconstruction process, advanced characterizations, and influencing parameters is provided. On this basis, the typical strategies for manipulating the structural reconfiguration of catalysts are also explicitly discussed from the catalyst structure and working environment. By delivering the mechanism, strategies, insights, and techniques, this review will provide a comprehensive understanding of the structural reconstruction of cathodic catalysts in electroreduction reactions and future guidelines for their rational development.

         <title>Prospects for Simultaneously Capturing Carbon Dioxide and Harvesting Water from Air</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Capturing carbon dioxide alongside water in direct air capture (DAC) operations can alleviate water stress while also providing net negative greenhouse gas emissions. The immense volumes of air processed by DAC units suggest that significant quantities of water can be removed alongside carbon dioxide. Material and process considerations toward realizing this enticing target are critically discussed.








Abstract
Mitigation of anthropogenic climate change is expected to require large&#8208;scale deployment of carbon dioxide removal strategies. Prominent among these strategies is direct air capture with sequestration (DACS), which encompasses the removal and long&#8208;term storage of atmospheric CO2&#160;by purely engineered means. Because it does not require arable land or copious amounts of freshwater, DACS is already attractive in the context of sustainable development, but opportunities to improve its sustainability still exist. Leveraging differences in the chemistry of CO2&#160;and water adsorption within porous solids, here, the prospect of simultaneously removing water alongside CO2&#160;in direct air capture operations is investigated. In many cases, the co&#8208;adsorbed water can be desorbed separately from chemisorbed CO2&#160;molecules, enabling efficient harvesting of water from air. Depending upon the material employed and process conditions, the desorbed water can be of sufficiently high purity for industrial, agricultural, or potable use and can thus improve regional water security. Additionally, the recovered water can offset a portion of the costs associated with DACS. In this Perspective, molecular&#8208; and process&#8208;level insights are combined to identify routes toward realizing this nascent yet enticing concept.

         <title>Fabrication of Bragg Mirrors by Multilayer Inkjet Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully inkjet&#8208;printed Bragg mirrors are fabricated by alternately depositing poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) composite thin&#8208;film layers. The Bragg mirrors are tunable in color/spectrum by simply adjusting the printing parameters. With precise control of the layer thickness and uniformity, the reflectance of the printed Bragg mirrors reaches 99% with ten bilayers only.








Abstract
Bragg mirrors are widely applied in optical and photonic devices due to their capability of light management. However, the fabrication of Bragg mirrors is mainly accomplished by physical and chemical vapor deposition processes, which are costly and do not allow for lateral patterning. Here, the fabrication of Bragg mirrors by fully inkjet printing is reported. The photonic bandgap of Bragg mirrors is tailored by adjusting the number of bilayers in the stack and the layer thickness via simply varying printing parameters. An ultrahigh reflectance of 99% is achieved with the devices consisting of ten bilayers only, and the central wavelength of Bragg mirrors is tuned from visible into near&#8208;infrared wavelength range. Inkjet printing allows for fabricating Bragg mirrors on various substrates (e.g., glass and foils), in different sizes and variable lateral patterns. The printed Bragg mirrors not only exhibit a high reflection at designed wavelengths but also show an outstanding homogeneity in color over a large area. The approach thus enables additive manufacturing for various applications ranging from microscale photonic elements to enhanced functionality and aesthetics in large&#8208;area displays and solar technologies.

         <title>Stoichiometric Post&#8208;Modification of Hydrogel Microparticles Dictates Neural Stem Cell Fate in Microporous Annealed Particle Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between tetrazine and norbornene is used to create plain microgels for stoichiometric post&#8208;modification with various peptides to control neural progenitor cell growth and differentiation in vitro. YIGSR peptide presentation leads to neurosphere formation while IKVAV leads to stem cell spreading and differentiation.








Abstract
Microporous annealed particle (MAP) scaffolds are generated from assembled hydrogel microparticles (microgels). It has been previously demonstrated that MAP scaffold&#160;are porous, biocompatible, and recruit neural progenitor cells (NPCs) to the stroke cavity after injection into the stroke core. Here, the goal is to study NPC fate inside MAP&#160;scaffolds in vitro. To create plain microgels that can later be converted to contain different types of bioactivities, the inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between tetrazine and norbornene is utilized, which allows the post&#8208;modification of plain microgels stoichiometrically. As a result of adhesive peptide attachment, NPC spreading leads to contractile force generation which can be recorded by tracking microgel displacement. Alternatively, non&#8208;adhesive peptide integration results in neurosphere formation that grows within the void space&#160;of MAP scaffolds. Although the formed neurospheres do not impose a contractile force on the scaffolds, they are seen to continuously transverse the scaffolds. It is concluded that MAP scaffolds&#160;&#160;can be engineered to either promote neurogenesis or enhance stemness depending on the chosen post&#8208;modifications of the microgels, which can be key in modulating their phenotypes in various applications in vivo.

         <title>Promoting Dinuclear&#8208;Type Catalysis in Cu1&#8211;C3N4 Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dinuclear&#8208;type nitrile&#8211;azide cycloaddition in a 21 wt% carbon&#8208;nitride&#8208;supported copper single&#8208;atom catalyst (Cu1&#8211;C3N4) is demonstrated by reducing the inter&#8208;atom distance within the diffusion length of reactants, thus transforming the catalytic pathway from a poorly active single&#8208;site to dinuclear&#8208;type mechanism.








Abstract
Reducing particle size in supported metal catalysts to single&#8208;atom level isolates the active metal sites and maximizes the atomic utilization efficiency. However, the large inter&#8208;atom distance, particularly in low&#8208;loading single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC), is not favorable for a complex reaction where two (or more) reactants have to be activated. A key question is how to control the inter&#8208;atom distances to promote dinuclear&#8208;type coactivation at the adjacent metal sites. Here, it is reported that reducing the average inter&#8208;atom distance of copper SACs supported on carbon nitride (C3N4) to 0.74 &#177; 0.13&#160;nm allows these catalysts to exhibit a dinuclear&#8208;type catalytic mechanism in the nitrile&#8211;azide cycloaddition. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure study reveals a dynamic ligand exchange process between nitrile and azide, followed by their coactivation on dinuclear Cu SAC sites to form the tetrazole product. This work highlights that reducing the nearest&#8208;neighbor distance of SAC allows the mechanistic pathway to diversify from single&#8208;site to multisite catalysis.

         <title>Manipulating Hierarchical Orientation of Wet&#8208;Spun Hybrid Fibers via Rheological Engineering for Zn&#8208;Ion Fiber Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
With entropy&#8208;driven volume&#8208;exclusion effects, the rheological behavior of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) nanowire dispersions is regulated through the introduction of graphene oxide (GO) flakes. A quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state fiber Zn&#8208;ion battery is assembled to integrate into a wearable self&#8208;powered system, incorporating a GaAs solar cell to deliver a high overall efficiency (9.80%).








Abstract
Wet&#8208;spinning is a promising strategy to fabricate fiber electrodes for real commercial fiber battery applications, according to its great compatibility with large&#8208;scale fiber production. However, engineering the rheological properties of the electrochemical active materials to accommodate the viscoelasticity or liquid crystalline requirements for continuous wet&#8208;spinning remains a daunting challenge. Here, with entropy&#8208;driven volume&#8208;exclusion effects, the rheological behavior of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) nanowire dispersions is regulated through introducing 2D graphene oxide (GO) flakes in an optimal ratio. By optimizing the viscoelasticity and liquid&#8208;crystalline behavior of the spinning dope, the wet&#8208;spun hybrid fibers display controlled hierarchical orientation. The wet&#8208;spun V2O5/rGO hybrid fiber with the optimal 10:1 mass fraction (V2O5/rGO10:1) exhibits a highly oriented nanoblock arrangement, enabling efficient Zn&#8208;ion migration and an excellent Zn&#8208;ion storage capacity of 486.03 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1. A half&#8208;meter long quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state fiber Zn&#8208;ion battery is assembled with a polyacrylamide gel electrolyte and biocompatible Ecoflex encapsulation. The thus&#8208;derived fiber Zn&#8208;ion battery is integrated into a wearable self&#8208;powered system, incorporating a highly efficient GaAs solar cell, which delivers a record&#8208;high overall efficiency (9.80%) for flexible solar charging systems.

The wet-spun V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;/rGO hybrid fiber with the optimal 10:1 mass fraction (V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;/rGO&lt;sub&gt;10:1&lt;/sub&gt;) exhibits a highly oriented nanoblock arrangement, enabling efficient Zn-ion migration and an excellent Zn-ion storage capacity of 486.03 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. A half-meter long quasi-solid-state fiber Zn-ion battery is assembled with a polyacrylamide gel electrolyte and biocompatible Ecoflex encapsulation. The thus-derived fiber Zn-ion battery is integrated into a wearable self-powered system, incorporating a highly efficient GaAs solar cell, which delivers a record-high overall efficiency (9.80%) for flexible solar charging systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dendrite&#8208;Free and Long&#8208;Cycling Lithium Metal Battery Enabled by Ultrathin, 2D Shield&#8208;Defensive, and Single Lithium&#8208;Ion Conducting Polymeric Membrane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel ultrathin shield&#8208;defensive polymeric membrane obtained by layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking of 2D molecular brushes is successfully utilized to achieve long&#8208;cycling lithium metal batteries. For the molecular brushes, single lithium&#8208;ion conducting side&#8208;chains facilitate uniform lithium deposition, and rigid 2D extended aromatic backbones provide a superb layer upon layer protection function to prevent the dendrite growth at high current densities.








Abstract
Polymeric membranes are considered as promising materials to realize safe and long&#8208;life lithium metal batteries (LMBs). However, they are usually based on soft 1D linear polymers and thus cannot effectively inhibit piercing of lithium dendrites at high current density. Herein, single lithium&#8208;ion conducting molecular brushes (GO&#8208;g&#8208;PSSLi) are successfully designed and fabricated with a new 2D &#8220;soft&#8211;hard&#8211;soft&#8221; hierarchical structure by grafting hairy lithium polystyrenesulfonate (PSSLi) chains on both sides of graphene oxide (GO) sheets. The ultrathin GO&#8208;g&#8208;PSSLi membrane is further constructed by evaporation&#8208;induced layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer self&#8208;assembly of GO&#8208;g&#8208;PSSLi molecular brushes. Unlike conventional soft 1D linear polymeric structure, the rigid 2D extended aromatic structure of intralayer GO backbones can bear the shield effect of preventing the dendrites possibly generated at high current density from piercing. More importantly, such a shield effect can be significantly strengthened by layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking of 2D molecular brushes. On the other hand, the 3D interconnected interlayer channels and the soft single lithium&#8208;ion conducting PSSLi side&#8208;chains on the surface of channels provide rapid lithium&#8208;ion transportation pathways and homogenize lithium&#8208;ion flux. As a result, LMBs with GO&#8208;g&#8208;PSSLi membrane possess long&#8208;term reversible lithium plating/striping (6&#160;months) at high current density.

         <title>Rashba&#8211;Edelstein Effect in the h&#8208;BN Van Der Waals Interface for Magnetization Switching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Current&#8208;induced spin&#8211;orbit&#160;torque&#160;(SOT) is observed in the h&#8208;BN/SrRuO3 bilayer structure, where the h&#8208;BN is an insulator with negligible spin&#8211;orbit&#160;coupling. This SOT is strong enough to induce the switching of magnetization in SrRuO3. First&#8208;principles calculations suggest a giant Rashba effect at the interface between h&#8208;BN and SrRuO3 (110)pc thin film, which leads to the observed SOT based on a tight&#8208;binding model.








Abstract
Van der Waals materials are attracting great attention in the field of spintronics due to their novel physical properties. For example, they are utilized as spin&#8208;current generating materials in spin&#8211;orbit torque (SOT) devices, which offers an electrical way to control the magnetic state and is promising for future low&#8208;power electronics. However, SOTs have mostly been demonstrated in vdW materials with strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling (SOC). Here, the observation of a current&#8208;induced SOT in the h&#8208;BN/SrRuO3 bilayer structure is reported, where the vdW material (h&#8208;BN) is an insulator with negligible SOC. Importantly, this SOT is strong enough to induce the switching of the perpendicular magnetization in SrRuO3. First&#8208;principles calculations suggest a giant Rashba effect at the interface between vdW material and SrRuO3 (110)pc thin film, which leads to the observed SOT based on a simplified tight&#8208;binding model. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the current&#8208;induced magnetization switching can be modulated by the electric field. This study paves the way for exploring the current&#8208;induced SOT and magnetization switching by integrating vdW materials with ferromagnets.

         <title>Visualizing Ultrafast Defect&#8208;Controlled Interlayer Electron&#8211;Phonon Coupling in Van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defects open a new ultrafast interlayer electron&#8211;phonon coupling in WS2/graphene heterostructures, which involves a three&#8208;body collision between electrons in WS2 and both acoustic phonons and defects in graphene. This ultrafast process is directly visualized by femtosecond transient absorption microscopy. Through controlling the defect density in graphene, the interlayer electron&#8211;phonon scattering time ranges from 7.1 to 2.4 ps.








Abstract
Engineering ultrafast interlayer coupling provides access to new quantum phenomena and novel device functionalities in atomically thin van der Waals heterostructures. However, due to all the atoms of a monolayer material being exposed at the interfaces, the interlayer coupling is extremely susceptible to defects, resulting in high energy dissipation through heat and low device performance. The study of how defects affect the interlayer coupling at ultrafast and atomic scales remains a challenge. Here, using femtosecond transient absorption microscopy, a new defect&#8208;induced ultrafast interlayer electron&#8211;phonon coupling pathway is identified in a WS2/graphene heterostructure, involving a three&#8208;body collision between electrons in WS2 and both acoustic phonons and defects in graphene. This interaction manifests as the reduced defect&#8208;related Raman resonant activity and the accelerated electron&#8211;phonon scattering time from 7.1 to 2.4&#160;ps. Furthermore, the ultrafast interlayer coupling process is directly imaged. These insights will advance the fundamental knowledge of heat dissipation in nanoscale devices, and enable new ways to dynamically manipulate electrons and phonons via defects in van der Waals heterostructures.

         <title>Cluster&#8208;Glass for Low&#8208;Cost White&#8208;Light Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of amorphous molecular materials for white&#8208;light generation (WLG) by means of continuous&#8208;wave infrared lasers is introduced, denoted as &#8220;cluster&#8208;glass&#8221;. For their fabrication, compounds of the general formula [(PhSi)(CH2)3(PhSn)E3] (E&#160;=&#160;S, Se, Te) are synthesized in pure and crystalline form and reversibly transformed into amorphous, robust glasses of any shape by mild heating. The materials and WLG properties of the cluster&#8208;glasses are studied by a combined experimental and quantum chemical study.








Abstract
The development of efficient and high&#8208;brilliance white&#8208;light sources is an essential contribution to innovative emission technologies. Materials exhibiting strong nonlinear optical properties, in particular second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) or white&#8208;light generation (WLG), have therefore been investigated with great activity in recent times. While many new approaches have been reported until now, the processability of the compounds remains a challenge. Here, a new class of materials, denoted as &#8220;cluster&#8208;glass&#8221;, which do not only show superior white&#8208;light emission properties upon irradiation by an inexpensive continuous&#8208;wave infrared laser diode, but can be easily accommodated in size and shape by formation of robust glassy solids, is introduced. The cluster&#8208;glass materials are fabricated by mild heating from crystalline powders of adamantane&#8208;type clusters exhibiting a quaternary, inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid cluster core [(PhSi)(CH2)3(PhSn)E3] (E&#160; = &#160;S, Se, Te). The process is fully reversible and preserves the integrity of the clusters in the glass, as proven by solution spectroscopy and recrystallization. Theoretical studies corroborate the importance of the quaternary nature of the cluster cores for the observed structural and optical phenomena. Thanks to these findings, high&#8208;brilliance white&#8208;light sources can be synthesized in form of stable, robust glass of any shape, which ultimately renders them suitable for everyday's applications.

Here, a new class of materials, denoted as &#8220;cluster-glass&#8221;, which do not only show superior white-light emission properties upon irradiation by an inexpensive continuous-wave infrared laser diode, but can be easily accommodated in size and shape by formation of robust glassy solids, is introduced. The cluster-glass materials are fabricated by mild heating from crystalline powders of adamantane-type clusters exhibiting a quaternary, inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid cluster core [(PhSi)(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PhSn)E&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] (E&#160; = &#160;S, Se, Te). The process is fully reversible and preserves the integrity of the clusters in the glass, as proven by solution spectroscopy and recrystallization. Theoretical studies corroborate the importance of the quaternary nature of the cluster cores for the observed structural and optical phenomena. Thanks to these findings, high-brilliance white-light sources can be synthesized in form of stable, robust glass of any shape, which ultimately renders them suitable for everyday's applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multiple&#8208;Resonance Extension and Spin&#8208;Vibronic&#8208;Coupling&#8208;Based Narrowband Blue Organic Fluorescence Emitters with Over 30% Quantum Efficiency</title>

         <dc:description>
An indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole&#8208;derived extended multiple&#8208;resonance structure, driven by the spin&#8208;vibronic model, is designed to reduce the gap between the singlet and triplet excited states and to increase absolute photoluminescence quantum yield. Pure blue organic&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diodes with a high external quantum efficiency over 30% and a narrow full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum of 23&#160;nm are realized with extended multiple&#8208;resonance emitters.








Abstract
Achieving narrow&#8208;bandwidth emission and high external quantum efficiency (EQE) simultaneously is a challenge for next&#8208;generation blue&#8208;emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this study, novel multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters are developed by fusing an indolocarbazole unit with two carbazole skeletons using para&#8208;oriented nitrogen atoms. The resulting rigid and planar &#960;&#8208;system without electron&#8208;accepting atoms exhibits pure blue photoluminescence at 470&#160;nm, reaching a 100% quantum yield with a full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 25&#160;nm. Higher&#8208;level quantum chemistry calculations confirm an MR effect within the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and an enhanced triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet crossover (104 s&#8722;1) through a reduced energy gap (&#916;EST) coupled with large spin&#8208;vibronic coupling mediated by low&#8208;lying triplet excited states. An OLED fabricated using the MR&#8208;TADF emitter with CIE color coordinates of (0.12, 0.16) exhibits a record high EQE of 30.9% and a small FWHM of 23&#160;nm. With further optimization of the device structure, a high EQE of 33.8% is achieved without additional outcoupling enhancements owing to the near&#8208;perfect horizontal alignment of the emitting dipoles.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Dot Perovskite Spectrometer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;dot perovskite spectrometer is demonstrated, which first breaks the long&#8208;standing restriction of footprint&#8208;resolution. The control of ion migration in the perovskite is the key of the spectrum richness and cyclic stability. Without any optical and mechanical structure, the spectrum can be recognized by a single detector through the bias stimulated photogain modulation.








Abstract
There are significant applications for miniature on&#8208;chip spectrometers in many fields. However, at present, on&#8208;chip spectrometers have to utilize an integrated strategy to achieve spectral analysis, which undoubtedly squanders the photosensitive area and adds pressure to the miniaturization of the spectrometer. Here, a unique spectrometer design that adopts a single detection point with in situ modulation realized by the photogain control at various bias voltages is demonstrated. With micrometer&#8208;level footprints, this single&#8208;dot spectrometer processes a resolution of about 5&#160;nm and a response time down to about 197 &#181;s. This is the first in situ perovskite modulation strategy that breaks the footprint&#8208;resolution restriction of spectrum analysis and demonstrates a new design direction for functional perovskite devices.

         <title>Bioinspired Stretchable Transducer for Wearable Continuous Monitoring of Respiratory Patterns in Humans and Animals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bio&#8208;inspired composite silicone transducer, consisting of an air channel encapsulated within a silicone elastomer, measures mechanical forces applied to its surface during respiration. The transducer technology reported is suitable for use with furry animals (pets and laboratory animals) and humans for unobtrusive monitoring of respiration over fur or clothing.








Abstract
A bio&#8208;inspired continuous wearable respiration sensor modeled after the lateral line system of fish is reported which is used for detecting mechanical disturbances in the water. Despite the clinical importance of monitoring respiratory activity in humans and animals, continuous measurements of breathing patterns and rates are rarely performed in or outside of clinics. This is largely because conventional sensors are too inconvenient or expensive for wearable sensing for most individuals and animals. The bio&#8208;inspired air&#8208;silicone composite transducer (ASiT) is placed on the chest and measures respiratory activity by continuously measuring the force applied to an air channel embedded inside a silicone&#8208;based elastomeric material. The force applied on the surface of the transducer during breathing changes the air pressure inside the channel, which is measured using a commercial pressure sensor and mixed&#8208;signal wireless electronics. The transducer produced in this work are extensively characterized and tested with humans, dogs, and laboratory rats. The bio&#8208;inspired ASiT may enable the early detection of a range of disorders that result in altered patterns of respiration. The technology reported can also be combined with artificial intelligence and cloud computing to algorithmically detect illness in humans and animals remotely, reducing unnecessary visits to clinics.

         <title>W Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for CH4 Photooxidation in Water Vapor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mass fabrication of low&#8208;cost tungsten single atom photocatalysts is achieved by directly calcining urea and sodium tungstate under atmosphere. These single&#8208;atom photocatalysts can manage H2O2 in situ generation and decomposition into &#183;OH to achieve highly efficient CH4 photooxidation in water vapor, and the products can be facilely switched from HCOOH to CH3OH by the liquid&#8211;solid phase transition.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven high&#8208;efficiency and direct conversion of methane into high&#8208;value&#8208;added liquid oxygenates against overoxidation remains a great challenge. Herein, facile and mass fabrication of low&#8208;cost tungsten single&#8208;atom photocatalysts is achieved by directly calcining urea and sodium tungstate under atmosphere (W&#8208;SA&#8208;PCN&#8208;m, urea amount m&#160;= 7.5, 15, 30, and 150&#160;g). The single&#8208;atom photocatalysts can manage H2O2 in situ generation and decomposition into &#183;OH, thus achieving highly efficient CH4 photooxidation in water vapor under mild conditions. Systematic investigations demonstrate that integration of multifunctions of methane activation, H2O2 generation, and decomposition into one photocatalyst can dramatically promote methane conversion to C1 oxygenates with a yield as high as 4956 &#181;mol gcat&#8722;1, superior to that of the most reported non&#8208;precious photocatalysts. Liquid&#8211;solid phase transition can induce the products to facilely switch in&#160;from HCOOH to CH3OH by pulling the catalyst above water with CH3OH/HCOOH ratio from 10% (in H2O) to 80% (above H2O).

         <title>Turbostratic Boron&#8211;Carbon&#8211;Nitrogen and Boron Nitride by Flash Joule Heating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Turbostratic boron&#8211;carbon&#8211;nitrogen and boron nitride compounds with various chemical compositions can be prepared by the ultrafast and solvent&#8208;free flash Joule heating method. The obtained flash boron&#8211;carbon&#8211;nitrogen (f&#8208;BCN) is easily exfoliated via various mechanical methods. Compared to commercial hexagonal boron nitride nanoplates, flash boron nitride sheets demonstrate more stable dispersibility in aqueous solution. Furthermore, the addition of f&#8208;BCN as barrier fillers in poly(vinyl alcohol) nanocomposites shows higher corrosion protection efficiency, &#8776;97.3% in 0.5 m H2SO4 and &#8776;92.1% in 3.5 wt% NaCl (aq).








Abstract
Turbostratic layers in 2D materials have an interlayer misalignment. The lack of alignment expands the intrinsic interlayer distances and weakens the optical and electronic interactions between adjacent layers. This introduces properties distinct from those structures with well&#8208;aligned lattices and strong coupling interactions. However, direct and rapid synthesis of turbostratic materials remains a challenge owing to their thermodynamically metastable properties. Here, a flash Joule heating (FJH) method to achieve bulk synthesis of boron&#8211;carbon&#8211;nitrogen ternary compounds with turbostratic structures by a kinetically controlled ultrafast cooling process that takes place within milliseconds (103&#160;to&#160;104 K s&#8722;1) is reported. Theoretical calculations support the existence of turbostratic structures and provide estimates of the energy barriers with respect to conversion into the corresponding well&#8208;aligned counterparts. When using non&#8208;carbon conductive additives, a direct synthesis of boron nitride is possible. The turbostratic nature facilitates mechanical exfoliation and more stable dispersions. Accordingly, the addition of flash products to a poly(vinyl alcohol) nanocomposite film coating a copper surface greatly improves the copper's resistance to corrosion in 0.5 m sulfuric acid or 3.5 wt% saline solution. FJH allows the use of bulk materials as reactants and provides a rapid approach to large quantities of the hitherto hard&#8208;to&#8208;access turbostratic materials.

         <title>Fast Near&#8208;Infrared Photodetection Using III&#8211;V Colloidal Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amphoteric liganding strategy is developed to simultaneously address In and As dangling bonds on InAs colloidal quantum dot (CQD) surfaces, which provides passivation and charge transport for low&#8208;permittivity CQD solids. The resulting photodiodes achieve a response time faster than 2 ns&#8212;the fastest photodiode among previously&#160;reported CQD photodiodes&#8212;combined with an external quantum efficiency of 30% at 940 nm.








Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are promising materials for infrared (IR) light detection due to their tunable bandgap and their solution processing; however, to date, the time response of CQD IR photodiodes is inferior to that provided by Si and InGaAs. It is reasoned that the high permittivity of II&#8211;VI CQDs leads to slow charge extraction due to screening and capacitance, whereas III&#8211;Vs&#8212;if their surface chemistry can be mastered&#8212;offer a low permittivity and thus increase potential for high&#8208;speed operation. In initial studies, it is found that the covalent character in indium arsenide (InAs) leads to imbalanced charge transport, the result of unpassivated surfaces, and uncontrolled heavy doping. Surface management using amphoteric ligand coordination is reported, and it is found that the approach addresses simultaneously the In and As surface dangling bonds. The new InAs CQD solids combine high mobility (0.04 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) with a 4&#215; reduction in permittivity compared to PbS CQDs. The resulting photodiodes achieve a response time faster than 2&#160;ns&#8212;the fastest photodiode among previously reported CQD photodiodes&#8212;combined with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 30% at 940&#160;nm.

         <title>Versatile Sequential Casting Processing for Highly Efficient and Stable Binary Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sequential casting (SC) processing is practical and universal for device performance improvement in both fullerene&#8208; and nonfullerene&#8208;based systems of organic solar cells (OSCs). A swelling&#8211;intercalation phase&#8208;separation model is proposed to interpret the morphology evolution during SC processing. Notably, a champion efficiency of 18.86% (certified as 18.44%) is reached from SC processing, representing the highest value among binary OSCs.








Abstract
Forming an ideal bulk heterojunction (BHJ) morphology is a critical issue governing the photon to electron process in organic solar cells (OSCs). Complementary to the widely&#8208;used blend casting (BC) method for BHJ construction, sequential casting (SC) can also enable similar or even better morphology and device performance for OSCs. Here, BC and SC methods on three representative donor:acceptor (D:A) blends are utilized, that is, PM6:PC71BM, PM6:IT&#8208;4F and PM6:L8&#8208;BO. Higher power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in all cases by taking advantage of beneficial morphology from SC processing are achieved, and a champion PCE of 18.86% (certified as 18.44%) based on the PM6:L8&#8208;BO blend is reached, representing the record value among binary OSCs. The observations on phase separation and vertical distribution inspire the proposal of the swelling&#8211;intercalation phase&#8208;separation model to interpret the morphology evolution during SC processing. Further, the vertical phase segregation is found to deliver an improvement of device performance via affecting the charge transport and collection processes, as evidenced by the D:A&#8208;ratio&#8208;dependent photovoltaic properties. Besides, OSCs based on SC processing show advantages on device photostability and upscale fabrication. This work demonstrates the versatility and efficacy of the SC method for BHJ&#8208;based OSCs.

         <title>Brain Co&#8208;Delivery of Temozolomide and Cisplatin for Combinatorial Glioblastoma Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glioblastoma (GBM) cell membrane camouflaged biomimetic nanoparticles (MNPs) with pH&#8208;sensitive polymer as core are developed for effective temozolomide (TMZ) and cisplatin (CDDP) brain&#8208;targeting co&#8208;delivery, achieving effective antitumor efficacy in both U87MG&#8208; and TMZ&#8208;resistant U251R orthotopic mice models with negligible side effects.








Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is an intractable malignancy with high recurrence and mortality. Combinatorial therapy based on temozolomide (TMZ) and cisplatin (CDDP) shows promising potential for GBM therapy in clinical trials. However, significant challenges include limited blood&#8211;brain&#8208;barrier (BBB) penetration, poor targeting of GBM tissue/cells, and systemic side effects, which hinder its efficacy in GBM therapy. To surmount these challenges,&#160;new GBM&#8208;cell membrane camouflaged and pH&#8208;sensitive biomimetic nanoparticles (MNPs) inspired by the fact that cancer cells readily pass the BBB and localize with homologous cells, are developed. This study's results show that MNPs can efficiently co&#8208;load TMZ and CDDP, transport these across the BBB to specifically target GBM. Incorporation of pH&#8208;sensitive polymer then allows for controlled release of drug cargos at GBM sites for combination drug therapy. Mice bearing orthotopic U87MG or drug&#8208;resistant U251R GBM tumor and treated with MNPs@TMZ+CDDP show a potent anti&#8208;GBM effect, greatly extending the survival time relative to mice receiving single&#8208;drug loaded nanoparticles. No obvious side effects are apparent in histological analyses or blood routine studies. Considering these results, the study's new nanoparticle formulation overcomes multiple challenges currently limiting the efficacy of combined TMZ and CDDP GBM drug therapy and appears to be a promising strategy for future GBM combinatorial chemotherapy.

Superconducting materials&#8212;which work best in cold environments, such as those found in outer space&#8212;are shown to provide a mechanism to harvest energy that does not require light. A superconducting magnetic levitation (maglev) magnetoelectric generator can convert mechanical impact to electricity.








Abstract
Solar cells are conventionally used to harvest energy in outer space, but they are ineffective in dark locations. Here, it is shown that superconducting materials&#8212;which work best in cold environments, such as those found in outer space&#8212;provide a mechanism to harvest energy that does not require light. A superconducting magnetic levitation (maglev) magnetoelectric generator (SMMG) can convert mechanical impacts to electricity at its working temperature &lt;90 K. The SMMG device consists of a permanent magnet, a conductive coil, and a superconducting layer (SL). Owing to the existence of the SL, the permanent magnet levitates over the SL and rapidly returns to an equilibrium height after being displaced by a mechanical impact. The impact changes the gap between the levitated magnet and the coil, resulting in a variation in magnetic flux that induces electrical current in the coil. Thus, the SMMG converts low&#8208;frequency (&lt;3.7&#160;Hz) mechanical energy to electricity. The output maximum peak voltage, peak power, and peak power density of the SMMG are 4.3&#160;V, 35&#160;mW, and 17.8&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2, respectively, with a load resistance of 300 &#937;. The SMMG can charge a capacitor of 10&#160;000 &#181;F to 3.8&#160;V with a continuous impact, which is sufficient to power critical wireless communication. The superconductor works best in cold environments and therefore is well&#8208;suited for providing electricity to sensors and communication devices in outer space, particularly in places where the sun may not reach.

         <title>A Top&#8208;Down Strategy to Engineer ActiveLayer Morphology for Highly Efficient and Stable All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile top&#8208;down strategy to control the all&#8208;polymer solar cell (all&#8208;PSC) morphology is developed by layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer processing. Optimal intermixing of polymer components and improved molecular packing of bottom layer and top layer can be achieved by choosing a suitable top&#8208;layer processing solvent. Consequently, a favorable morphology with gradient vertical composition distribution is realized, affording a high all&#8208;PSC efficiency of 17.0%.








Abstract
A major challenge hindering the further development of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) employing polymerized small&#8208;molecule acceptors is the relatively low fill factor (FF) due to the difficulty in controlling the active&#8208;layer morphology. The issues typically arise from oversized phase separation resulting from the thermodynamically unfavorable mixing between two macromolecular species, and disordered molecular orientation/packing of highly anisotropic polymer chains. Herein, a facile top&#8208;down controlling strategy to engineer the morphology of all&#8208;polymer blends is developed by leveraging the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) deposition. Optimal intermixing of polymer components can be achieved in the two&#8208;step process by tuning the bottom&#8208;layer polymer swelling during top&#8208;layer deposition. Consequently, both the molecular orientation/packing of the bottom layer and the molecular ordering&#160;of the top layer can be optimized with a suitable top&#8208;layer&#160;processing solvent. A favorable morphology with gradient vertical composition distribution for efficient charge transport and extraction is therefore realized, affording a high all&#8208;PSC efficiency of 17.0% with a FF of 76.1%. The derived devices also possess excellent long&#8208;term thermal stability and can retain &gt;90% of their initial efficiencies after being annealed at 65&#160;&#176;C for 1300 h. These results validate the distinct advantages of employing an LBL processing protocol to fabricate high&#8208;performance all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Synergistic Crystallization and Passivation by a Single Molecular Additive for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By simultaneous control of the intermediate phase during crystallization of the perovskite film and surface passivation using a single&#160;molecule additive N,N&#8208;dimethylimidodicarbonimidic diamide hydroiodide (DIAI), which has multiple functional groups, an impressive device photoelectric conversion efficiency as high as 24.13% with negligible hysteresis is obtained. The bare device without any encapsulation maintains 94.1% of its initial efficiency after ambient exposure for over 1000 h.








Abstract
With its power conversion efficiency surpassing those of all other thin&#8208;film solar cells only a few years after its invention, the perovskite solar cell has become a superstar. Controlling the intermediate phase of crystallization is a key to obtaining high&#8208;quality perovskite films. Herein, a single molecule additive, N,N&#8208;dimethylimidodicarbonimidic diamide hydroiodide (DIAI), is incorporated into the perovskite precursor to eliminate the influence of intermediate phases. By taking advantage of the interaction of DIAI and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), the intermediate phase FAI&#8208;PbI2&#8208;DMSO complex is eliminated, and &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 is entirely converted to the desired &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 during the crystallization step, resulting in enlarged grain size and improved crystalline quality. This is the first observation in the solution method that FAPbI3 can be obtained without an intermediate phase for high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, DIAI is effective at passivating surface defects, resulting in reduced defect density, increased carrier lifetime, and improved device efficiency and stability. The champion device achieves an efficiency of 24.13%. Furthermore, the bare device without any encapsulation maintains 94.1% of its initial efficiency after ambient exposure over 1000h. This work contributes a strategy of synergistic crystallization and passivation to directly form &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 from the precursor solution without the influence of intermediate impurities for high&#8208;performance perovskite applications.

         <title>Walking Dead Tumor Cells for Targeted Drug Delivery Against Lung Metastasis of Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cell&#8208;based drug delivery system is developed by anchoring anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibodies and doxorubicin&#8208;loaded liposomes on tumor cell corpses to treat lung metastatic TNBC. The cell platform, named &#8220;walking dead tumor cells&#8221;, promotes lung&#8208;metastasis&#8208;targeted drug delivery and enables temporal release of drugs via bioinspired&#8208;activation and nano&#8208;backpack. Improved therapeutic efficacy against lung metastasis is achieved by the platform in mouse models.








Abstract
Lung metastasis is challenging in patients with triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC). Surgery is always not available due to the dissemination of metastatic foci and most drugs are powerless because of poor retention at metastatic sites. TNBC cells generate an inflamed microenvironment and overexpress adhesive molecules to promote invasion and colonization. Herein, &#8220;walking dead&#8221; TNBC cells are developed through conjugating anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 (programmed death protein 1 inhibitor) and doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;loaded liposomes onto cell corpses for temporal chemo&#8208;immunotherapy against lung metastasis. The walking dead TNBC cells maintain plenary tumor antigens to conduct vaccination effects. Anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibodies are conjugated to cell corpses via reduction&#8208;activated linker, and DOX&#8208;loaded liposomes are attached by maleimide&#8211;thiol coupling. This anchor strategy enables rapid release of anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 upon reduction conditions while long&#8208;lasting release of DOX at inflamed metastatic sites. The walking dead TNBC cells improve pulmonary accumulation and local retention of drugs, reprogram the lung microenvironment through damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and PD&#8208;1 blockade, and prolong overall survival of lung metastatic 4T1 and EMT6&#8208;bearing mice. Taking advantage of the walking dead TNBC cells for pulmonary preferred delivery of chemotherapeutics and checkpoint inhibitors, this study suggests an alternative treatment option of chemo&#8208;immunotherapy to augment the efficacy against lung metastasis.

         <title>Identifying the Correlation between Structural Parameters and Anisotropic Magnetic Properties in I&#63743;Mn&#63743;V Semiconductors: A Possible Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive study of the single&#8208;crystal growth of I&#63743;Mn&#63743;V (I: alkali metals and V: pnictogen elements) compound series, physical property measurements of their intrinsic anisotropic character, and their theoretical electronic and magnetic structures suggests a possible room&#8208;temperature magnetic semiconductor. These experimental and computational results broaden the scope of intrinsic magnetic semiconductors in quasi&#8208;2D layer&#8208;structured systems for spintronics.








Abstract
Layer&#8208;structured materials are of central importance in a wide range of research fields owing to their unique properties originating from their two dimensionality and anisotropy. Herein, quasi&#8208;2D layer&#8208;structured I&#63743;Mn&#63743;V (I: alkali metals and V: pnictogen elements) compounds are investigated, which are potential antiferromagnetic (AFM) semiconductors. Single crystals of I&#63743;Mn&#63743;V compounds are successfully grown using the self&#8208;flux method and their electronic and magnetic properties are analyzed in correlation with structural parameters. Combined with theoretical calculations, the structural analysis indicates that the variation in the bonding angle between V&#63743;Mn&#63743;V is responsible for the change in the orbital hybridization of Mn and V, predominantly affecting their anisotropic semiconducting properties. Anisotropy in the magnetic properties is also found, where AFM ordering is expected to occur in the in&#8208;plane direction, as supported by spin&#8211;structure calculations. Furthermore, a possible ferromagnetic (FM) transition is discussed in relation to the vacancy defects. This study provides a candidate material group for AFM and FM spintronics and a basis for exploring magnetic semiconductors in quasi&#8208;2D layer&#8208;structured systems.

         <title>Ultrafast Sintering for Ceramic&#8208;Based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microwave&#8208;assisted ultrafast sintering technique is used to densify various ceramic electrolytes and co&#8208;sinter electrode&#8211;electrolyte integration, which has advantages of ultrashort sintering time (&#8776;25 s), energy&#8208;saving, suppressed Li/Na element loss, compact electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface, restrained element cross&#8208;diffusion, and so on. This method may extend to other ceramic multilayer&#8208;based solid devices.








Abstract
Long processing time and high temperatures are often required in sintering ceramic electrolytes, which lead to volatile element loss and high cost. Here, an ultrafast sintering method of microwave&#8208;induced carbothermal shock to fabricate various ceramic electrolytes in seconds is reported. Furthermore, it is also possible to integrate the electrode and electrolyte in one step by simultaneous co&#8208;sintering. Based on this ultrafast co&#8208;sintering technique, an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal battery with a high areal capacity is successfully achieved, realizing a promising electrochemical performance at room temperature. This method can extend to other various ceramic multilayer&#8208;based solid devices.

         <title>Formulating High&#8208;Rate and Long&#8208;Cycle Heterostructured Layered Oxide Cathodes by Local Chemistry and Orbital Hybridization Modulation for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An abnormal heterostructured biphasic layered oxide cathode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries&#160;(SIBs) is successfully constructed, and its dynamic formation process, intrinsic structural properties, and electrochemical behavior are elucidated by a series of in situ characterization techniques and density functional theory calculations. The concept of accurately manipulating structural evolution and formulating heterostructured cathode materials by local chemistry and orbital hybridization modulation is further demonstrated.








Abstract
It is still very urgent and challenging to simultaneously develop high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;cycle oxide cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) because of the sluggish kinetics and complex multiphase evolution during cycling. Here, the concept of accurately manipulating structural evolution and formulating high&#8208;performance heterostructured biphasic layered oxide cathodes by local chemistry and orbital hybridization modulation is reported. The P2&#8208;structure stoichiometric composition of the cathode material shows a layered P2&#8208; and O3&#8208;type heterostructure that is explicitly evidenced by various macroscale and atomic&#8208;scale techniques. Surprisingly, the heterostructured cathode displays excellent rate performance, remarkable cycling stability (capacity retention of 82.16% after 600 cycles at 2&#160;C), and outstanding compatibility with hard carbon anode because of the integrated advantages of intergrowth structure and local environment regulation. Meanwhile, the formation process from precursors during calcination and the highly reversible dynamic structural evolution during the Na+ intercalation/deintercalation process are clearly articulated by a series of in situ characterization techniques. Also, the intrinsic structural properties and corresponding electrochemical behavior are further elucidated by the density of states and electron localization function of density functional theory calculations. Overall, this strategy, which finely tunes the local chemistry and orbitals hybridization for high&#8208;performance SIBs, will open up a new field for other materials.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Mixing Enhanced Proximity Effect in Aluminum&#8208;Based Superconductor&#8211;Semiconductor Hybrids</title>

In superconducting quantum circuits, aluminum is one of the most widely used materials. Aluminum&#8208;based devices suffer from poor magnetic field compatibility. In this article, this limitation is resolved by showing that adatoms of heavy elements (e.g., platinum) increase the critical field of thin aluminum films by more than a factor of two.








Abstract
In superconducting quantum circuits, aluminum is one of the most widely used materials. It is currently also the superconductor of choice for the development of topological qubits. However, aluminum&#8208;based devices suffer from poor magnetic field compatibility. Herein, this limitation is resolved by showing that adatoms of heavy elements (e.g., platinum) increase the critical field of thin aluminum films by more than a factor of two. Using tunnel junctions, it is shown that the increased field resilience originates from spin&#8208;orbit scattering introduced by Pt. This property is exploited in the context of the superconducting proximity effect in semiconductor&#8211;superconductor hybrids, where it is shown that InSb nanowires strongly coupled to Al/Pt films can maintain superconductivity up to 7&#160;T. The two&#8208;electron charging effect is shown to be robust against the presence of heavy adatoms. Additionally, non&#8208;local spectroscopy is used in a three&#8208;terminal geometry to probe the bulk of hybrid devices, showing that it remains free of sub&#8208;gap states. Finally, it is demonstrated that proximitized semiconductor states maintain their ability to Zeeman&#8208;split in an applied magnetic field. Combined with the chemical stability and well&#8208;known fabrication routes of aluminum, Al/Pt emerges as the natural successor to Al&#8208;based systems and is a compelling alternative to other superconductors, whenever high&#8208;field resilience is required.

         <title>Electrical Sensing of the Thermal and Light&#8208;Induced Spin Transition in Robust Contactless Spin&#8208;Crossover/Graphene Hybrid Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid devices formed by sublimable spin&#8208;crossover molecules deposited over graphene are fabricated. The novel device preparation protocol used results in fast and efficient photoinduced spin transitions, and is even enhanced in devices with a contactless configuration. This methodology allows further integration of spin&#8208;crossover molecules in thermal&#160;or light&#8208;addressable spintronic and straintronic devices based on 2D materials.








Abstract
Hybrid devices based on spin&#8208;crossover (SCO)/2D heterostructures grant a highly sensitive platform to detect the spin transition in the molecular SCO component and tune the properties of the 2D material. However, the fragility of the SCO materials upon thermal treatment, light irradiation, or contact with surfaces and the methodologies used for their processing have limited their applicability. Here, an easily processable and robust SCO/2D hybrid device with outstanding performance based on the sublimable SCO [Fe(Pyrz)2] molecule deposited over chemical vapor deposition (CVD) graphene is reported, which is fully compatible with electronics industry protocols. Thus, a novel methodology based on growing an elusive polymorph of [Fe(Pyrz)2] (tetragonal phase) over graphene is developed that allows a fast and effective light&#8208;induced spin transition in the devices (&#8776;50% yield in 5&#160;min) to be detected electrically. Such performance can be enhanced even more when a flexible polymeric layer of poly(methyl methacrylate) is inserted in between the two active components in a contactless configuration, reaching a &#8776;100% yield in 5&#160;min.

     alt="Electrical Sensing of the Thermal and Light-Induced Spin Transition in Robust Contactless Spin-Crossover/Graphene Hybrid Devices"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hybrid devices formed by sublimable spin-crossover molecules deposited over graphene are fabricated. The novel device preparation protocol used results in fast and efficient photoinduced spin transitions, and is even enhanced in devices with a contactless configuration. This methodology allows further integration of spin-crossover molecules in thermal&#160;or light-addressable spintronic and straintronic devices based on 2D materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hybrid devices based on spin-crossover (SCO)/2D heterostructures grant a highly sensitive platform to detect the spin transition in the molecular SCO component and tune the properties of the 2D material. However, the fragility of the SCO materials upon thermal treatment, light irradiation, or contact with surfaces and the methodologies used for their processing have limited their applicability. Here, an easily processable and robust SCO/2D hybrid device with outstanding performance based on the sublimable SCO [Fe(Pyrz)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] molecule deposited over chemical vapor deposition (CVD) graphene is reported, which is fully compatible with electronics industry protocols. Thus, a novel methodology based on growing an elusive polymorph of [Fe(Pyrz)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (tetragonal phase) over graphene is developed that allows a fast and effective light-induced spin transition in the devices (&#8776;50% yield in 5&#160;min) to be detected electrically.

         <title>Studying Plasmon Dispersion of MXene for Enhanced Electromagnetic Absorption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The plasmon in MXene plays a role in the electromagnetic absorption, but such an effect has not yet been quantitatively analyzed due to the lack of knowledge of the MXene's plasmon dispersion, which is challengeable to measure for optical methods. The plasmon dispersions for individual MXene nanoflakes with varied thicknesses are measured using high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy.








Abstract
2D metal carbides and nitrides (MXene) are promising candidates for electromagnetic (EM) shielding, saturable absorption, thermal therapy, and photocatalysis owing to their excellent EM absorption. The plasmon resonances in metallic MXene micro/nanostructures may play an important role in enhancing the EM absorption; however, their contribution has not been determined due to the lack of a precise understanding of its plasmon behavior. Here, the use of high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy to measure the plasmon dispersion of MXene films with different thicknesses is reported, enabling accurate analysis of the EM absorption of complex MXene structures in a wide frequency range via a theoretical model. The EM absorption of MXene can be excited at the desired frequency by controlling the momentum (e.g., the sizes of the nanoflakes for EM excitation) as the strength can be enhanced by increasing the layer number and the interlayer distance in MXene. For example, a 3&#160;nm interlayer distance can nearly double the plasmon&#8208;enhanced EM absorption in MXene nanostructures. These findings can guide the design of advanced ultrathin EM absorption materials for a broad range of applications.

         <title>Tuning Organic Electrochemical Transistor Threshold Voltage using Chemically Doped Polymer Gates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modifying the work function of gate electrodes in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) via chemical doping makes threshold voltage an independently tunable parameter from channel properties, thereby retaining the electrochemical, transport, and amplifying properties of the OECT. This enables simultaneously low&#8208;power and electrochemically stable enhancement mode OECTs.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have shown promise as transducers and amplifiers of minute electronic potentials due to their large transconductances. Tuning the OECT threshold voltage is important to achieve low&#8208;powered devices with amplification properties within the desired operational voltage range. However, traditional design approaches have struggled to decouple channel and materials properties from threshold voltage, thereby compromising on several other OECT performance metrics, such as electrochemical stability, transconductance, and dynamic range. In this work, simple solution&#8208;processing methods are utilized to chemically dope polymer gate electrodes, thereby controlling their work function, which in turn tunes the operation voltage range of the OECTs without perturbing their channel properties. Chemical doping of initially air&#8208;sensitive polymer electrodes further improves their electrochemical stability in ambient conditions. Thus, OECTs that are simultaneously low&#8208;powered and electrochemically resistant to oxidative side reactions under ambient conditions are demonstrated. This approach shows that threshold voltage, which is once interwoven with other OECT properties, can in fact be an independent design parameter, expanding the design space of OECTs.

         <title>Spontaneous Construction of Nucleophilic Carbonyl&#8208;Containing Interphase toward Ultrastable Zinc&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nucleophilic carbonyl&#8208;containing interphase with strong zincphilicity and dendrite suppression ability is rationally designed as a spontaneous construction of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on a Zn anode, facilitating homogeneous Zn deposition and leading to the long&#8208;term stability of aqueous ZIBs. The cross&#8208;linking H&#8208;bond network formed by the electronegative carbonyl oxygen can bind water molecules while regulating the Zn&#8208;ion desolvation process and mitigating side reactions.








Abstract
Multifunctional interfacial engineering on the Zn anode to conquer dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution, and the sluggish kinetics associated with Zn deposition is highly desirable for boosting the commercialization of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, a spontaneous construction of carbonyl&#8208;containing layer on a Zn anode (Zn@ZCO) is rationally designed as an ion redistributor and functional protective interphase. It has strong zincphilicity and dendrite suppression ability due to the significant interaction of the highly electronegative and highly nucleophilic carbonyl oxygen, favoring ion transport and homogenizing Zn deposition effectively. On the other side, the hydrogen bond formed by the proton acceptor of oxygen atom in ZCO regulates the Zn&#8208;ion desolvation process at the interfaces, thus bounding water activity and then mitigating water&#8208;induced parasitic reactions. Consequently, the Zn@ZCO anode exhibits an extended cycling lifespan of 5000&#160;h (&gt;208&#160;days) with a dendrite&#8208;free surface and negligible by&#8208;products. More encouragingly, the effectiveness is also convincing in NH4V4O10&#8208;based full&#8208;cells with excellent rate performance and cyclic stability. The stabilized Zn anode enabled by the strategy of spontaneous construction of functional solid electrolyte interphase brings forward a facile and instructive approach toward high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;storage systems.

         <title>Theory&#8208;Driven Design of a Cationic Accelerator for High&#8208;Performance Electrolytic MnO2&#8211;Zn Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A cationic accelerator effectively facilitates rapid cations migration in an electrolyte and adequate charge transfer at the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface, benefiting the deposition/dissolution processes of both Mn2+ and Zn2+ cations to simultaneously improve the kinetics of cathodic MnO2/Mn2+ and anodic Zn/Zn2+ reactions, thereby enabling high&#8208;performance MnO2&#8211;Zn batteries with high energy efficiency and long&#8208;term cycle stability.








Abstract
Aqueous electrolytic MnO2&#8211;Zn batteries are considered as one of the most promising energy&#8208;storage devices for their cost effectiveness, high output voltage, and safety, but their electrochemical performance is limited by the sluggish kinetics of cathodic MnO2/Mn2+ and anodic Zn/Zn2+ reactions. To overcome this critical challenge, herein, a cationic accelerator (CA) strategy is proposed based on the prediction of first&#8208;principles calculations. Poly(vinylpyrrolidone) is utilized as a model to testify the rational design of the CA strategy. It manifests that the CA effectively facilitates rapid cations migration in electrolyte and adequate charge transfer at electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface, benefiting the deposition/dissolution processes of both Mn2+ and Zn2+ cations to simultaneously improve kinetics of cathodic MnO2/Mn2+ and anodic Zn/Zn2+ reactions. The resulting MnO2&#8211;Zn battery regulated by CA exhibits large reversible capacities of 455 mAh g&#8211;1 and 3.64 mAh cm&#8211;2 at 20 C, as well as a long lifespan of 2000 cycles with energy density retention of 90%, achieving one of the best overall performances in the electrolytic MnO2&#8211;Zn batteries. This comprehensive work integrating theoretical prediction with experimental studies provides opportunities to the development of high&#8208;performance energy&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Switchable Unipolar&#8208;Barrier Van der Waals Heterostructures with Natural Anisotropy for Full Linear Polarimetry Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A twisted unipolar barrier van der Waals heterostructure with bias&#8208;switchable natural polarization photoresponse is successfully designed, which enables full linear polarimetry detection from 0 to 180&#176;. Moreover, polarimetric imaging is further demonstrated with this developed photodetector in the mid&#8208;infrared range.








Abstract
Polarization&#8208;resolved photodetection in a compact footprint is of great interest for ultraminiaturized polarimeters to be used in a wide range of applications. However, probing the states of polarization (SOP) in materials with natural anisotropy are usually weak, limited by the material's natural dichroism or diattenuation. Here, a twisted unipolar&#8208;barrier van der Waals heterostructure (vdWH) to construct a bias&#8208;switchable polarization detection for retrieval of full SOP (from 0 to 180&#176;) for linear polarized incident light is reported. As a demonstration example, this study realizes the concept in a b&#8208;AsP/WS2/b&#8208;AsP vdWH relying on the natural anisotropic properties of the materials without using additional plasmonic/metasurface nanostructures to realize linear polarimetry in the mid&#8208;infrared range. Polarimetric imaging is further demonstrated with the developed linear polarimetry by directly displaying the Jones&#8208;vector&#8208;described SOP distribution of certain target object. This method, with the capabilities of detecting full linear SOP, is promising for the next&#8208;generation on&#8208;chip miniaturized polarimeters.

         <title>Conjugated Polymers for Microwave Applications: Untethered Sensing Platforms and Multifunctional Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The active reconfigurability of different microwave resonating structures is achieved through an emerging family of high&#8208;performance organic mixed&#8208;conductors, characterized by superior charge&#8208;transport properties and redox&#8208;tunability. This novel class of microwave devices displays optimal modulation performances, as well as the potential for unique functionalities in the contexts of autonomous bioelectronics and of reconfigurable microwave optics.








Abstract
In the past two decades, organic electronic materials have enabled and accelerated a large and diverse set of technologies, from energy&#8208;harvesting devices and electromechanical actuators, to flexible and printed (opto)electronic circuitry. Among organic (semi)conductors, organic mixed ion&#8211;electronic conductors (OMIECs) are now at the center of renewed interest in organic electronics, as they are key drivers of recent developments in the fields of bioelectronics, energy storage, and neuromorphic computing. However, due to the relatively slow switching dynamics of organic electronics, their application in microwave technology, until recently, has been overlooked. Nonetheless, other unique properties of OMIECs, such as their substantial electrochemical tunability, charge&#8208;modulation range, and processability, make this field of use ripe with opportunities. In this work, the use of a series of solution&#8208;processed intrinsic OMIECs is demonstrated to actively tune the properties of metamaterial&#8208;inspired microwave devices, including an untethered bioelectrochemical sensing platform that requires no external power, and a tunable resonating structure with independent amplitude&#8208; and frequency&#8208;modulation. These devices showcase the considerable potential of OMIEC&#8208;based metadevices in autonomous bioelectronics and reconfigurable microwave optics.

         <title>Binary Organic Solar Cells Breaking 19% via Manipulating the Vertical Component Distribution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance binary photovoltaic devices based on D18 and L8&#8208;BO are constructed via manipulating the vertical component distribution in a sequential deposition (SD) process. After tuning the spin&#8208;coating speeds of film deposition, the optimal SD device affords a record power conversion efficiency of 19.05% (certified, 18.9%) for binary single&#8208;junction organic solar cells, much higher than that of the corresponding blend casting device (18.14%).








Abstract
The variation of the vertical component distribution can significantly influence the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells (OSCs), mainly due to its impact on exciton dissociation and charge&#8208;carrier transport and recombination. Herein, binary devices are fabricated via sequential deposition (SD) of D18 and L8&#8208;BO materials in a two&#8208;step process. Upon independently regulating the spin&#8208;coating speeds of each layer deposition, the optimal SD device shows a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.05% for binary single&#8208;junction OSCs, much higher than that of the corresponding blend casting (BC) device (18.14%). Impressively, this strategy presents excellent universality in boosting the photovoltaic performance of SD devices, exemplified by several nonfullerene acceptor systems. The mechanism studies reveal that the SD device with preferred vertical components distribution possesses high crystallinity, efficient exciton splitting, low energy loss, and balanced charge transport, resulting in all&#8208;around enhancement of photovoltaic performances. This work provides a valuable approach for high&#8208;efficiency OSCs, shedding light on understanding the relationship between photovoltaic performance and vertical component distribution.

Microspectrometers
In article number 2200221, Haoxuan Sun, Liang Li, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate a new perovskite spectrometer design that is free from any optical or mechanical components and only requires one detection point. Such a spectrometer design breaks the long&#8208;standing restriction of footprint&#8208;resolution, and represents an advance for hyperspectral imaging.

Plasmon Dispersion of MXenes
Plasmons in MXenes play a role in electromagnetic absorption, but the effect has never been quantitatively analyzed due to the lack of plasmon dispersion. In article number 2201120, Xiaoxia Yang, Peng Gao, Qing Dai, and co&#8208;workers report the use of high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution electron&#8208;energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy to measure the plasmon dispersion of suspended MXenes. These ultrathin MXenes with broadband absorption provide a promising platform for high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Plasmon Dispersion of MXenes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plasmons in MXenes play a role in electromagnetic absorption, but the effect has never been quantitatively analyzed due to the lack of plasmon dispersion. In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202201120"&gt;2201120&lt;/a&gt;, Xiaoxia Yang, Peng Gao, Qing Dai, and co-workers report the use of high-spatial-resolution electron-energy-loss spectroscopy to measure the plasmon dispersion of suspended MXenes. These ultrathin MXenes with broadband absorption provide a promising platform for high-performance optoelectronic devices.

Organic Solar Cells
Forming an ideal bulk heterojunction morphology is a critical issue governing the photon to electron process in organic solar cells (OSCs). In article number 2203379, Lijian Zuo, Hongzheng Chen, and co&#8208;workers show how sequential&#8208;casting (SC) processing is practical and universal for improvement of device performance in both fullerene&#8208; and nonfullerene&#8208;based systems, in which the donor and acceptor are deposited sequentially. The fabricated OSCs show advantages regarding device performance, photostability and upscale fabrication. Such a film spin&#8208;coating method is analogous to the traditional Chinese pancake making process.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Active Sensing Based on Triboelectric Generators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;powered triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG)&#8208;based active sensors are vital for digital transformation and can be designed into wearable and flexible form factors. The evolution of TENG&#8208;based active sensors is outlined with primary focus on chemical and biosensors. Comprehensive discussion on the device mechanism, applications, sensing parameters is provided and the challenges in the field detailed.








Abstract
The demand for portable and wearable chemical or biosensors and their expeditious development in recent years has created a scientific challenge in terms of their continuous powering. As a result, mechanical energy harvesters such as piezoelectric and triboelectric generators (TEGs) have been explored recently either as sensors or harvesters to store charge in small, but long&#8208;life, energy&#8208;storage devices to power the sensors. The use of energy harvesters as sensors is particularly interesting, as with such multifunctional operations it is possible to reduce the number devices needed in a system, which also helps overcome the integration complexities. In this regard, TEGs are promising, particularly for energy autonomous chemical and biological sensors, as they can be developed with a wide variety of materials, and their mechanical energy to electricity conversion can be modulated by various analytes. This review focuses on this interesting dimension of TEGs and presents various self&#8208;powered active chemical and biological sensors. A brief discussion about the development of TEG&#8208;based physical, magnetic, and optical sensors is also included. The influence of environmental factors, various figures of merit, and the significance of TEG design are explained in context with the active sensing. Finally, the key applications, challenges, and future perspective of chemical and biological detection via TEGs are discussed with a view to drive further advances in the field of self&#8208;powered sensors.

         <title>Pushing the Natural Frontier: Progress on the Integration of Biomaterial Cues toward Combinatorial Biofabrication and Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress on the use of naturally derived materials is reviewed, as well as the integration of cell&#8208;driving cues ranging from biochemical ligands to mechanical properties and the underestimated role of cell&#8211;cell interactions, highlighting unreported synergies and antagonistic combinations, highlighting recent high&#8208;throughput discovery tools toward combinatorial biofabrication and tissue engineering.








Abstract
The engineering of fully functional, biological&#8208;like tissues requires biomaterials to direct cellular events to a near&#8208;native, 3D niche extent. Natural biomaterials are generally seen as a safe option for cell support, but their biocompatibility and biodegradability can be just as limited as their bioactive/biomimetic performance. Furthermore, integrating different biomaterial cues and their final impact on cellular behavior is a complex equation where the outcome might be very different from the sum of individual parts. This review critically analyses recent progress on biomaterial&#8208;induced cellular responses, from simple adhesion to more complex stem cell differentiation, looking at the ever&#8208;growing possibilities of natural materials modification. Starting with a discussion on native material formulation and the inclusion of cell&#8208;instructive cues, the roles of shape and mechanical stimuli, the susceptibility to cellular remodeling, and the often&#8208;overlooked impact of cellular density and cell&#8211;cell interactions within constructs, are delved into. Along the way, synergistic and antagonistic combinations reported in vitro and in vivo are singled out, identifying needs and current lessons on the development of natural biomaterial libraries to solve the cell&#8211;material puzzle efficiently. This review brings together knowledge from different fields envisioning next&#8208;generation, combinatorial biomaterial development toward complex tissue engineering.

         <title>Changing Fate: Reprogramming Cells via Engineered Nanoscale Delivery Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanomaterials enabling cell reprogramming provide a new paradigm for the restoration of healthy tissue and organs. Future clinical interventions will no longer require invasive surgery, or pharmaceutical regimens; it can be achieved through the controlled reprograming of regenerative cells. The authors review the multiscale delivery vehicles that can support and precisely deliver the raw genetic material and transformative vectors required.








Abstract
The incorporation of nanotechnology in regenerative medicine is at the nexus of fundamental innovations and early&#8208;stage breakthroughs, enabling exciting biomedical advances. One of the most exciting recent developments is the use of nanoscale constructs to influence the fate of cells, which are the basic building blocks of healthy function. Appropriate cell types can be effectively manipulated by direct cell reprogramming; a robust technique to manipulate cellular function and fate, underpinning burgeoning advances in drug delivery systems, regenerative medicine, and disease remodeling. Individual transcription factors, or combinations thereof, can be introduced into cells using both viral and nonviral delivery systems. Existing approaches have inherent limitations. Viral&#8208;based tools include issues of viral integration into the genome of the cells, the propensity for uncontrollable silencing, reduced copy potential and cell specificity, and neutralization via the immune response. Current nonviral cell reprogramming tools generally suffer from inferior expression efficiency. Nanomaterials are increasingly being explored to address these challenges and improve the efficacy of both viral and nonviral delivery because of their unique properties such as small size and high surface area. This review presents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art research in cell reprogramming, focused on recent breakthroughs in the deployment of nanomaterials as cell reprogramming delivery tools.

         <title>Large Room Temperature Anomalous Transverse Thermoelectric Effect in Kagome Antiferromagnet YMn6Sn6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Kagome magnets possess several novel non&#8208;trivial topological features owing to the strong correlation between topology and magnetism, that extends to their applications in the field of thermoelectricity. Conventional thermoelectric (TE) devices use the Seebeck effect to convert heat into electrical energy. In contrast, transverse thermoelectric devices based on the Nernst effect are attracting recent attention due to their unique transverse geometry, which uses a single material to eliminate the need for a multitude of electrical connections compared to conventional TE devices. In this study, we obtain a large anomalous transverse thermoelectric effect of &#8764; 2 &#956;V K&#8722;1 at room temperature in a kagome antiferromagnet YMn6Sn6 single crystal. The obtained value is larger than that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art canted antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials and comparable with ferromagnetic systems. The large anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) can be attributed to the net Berry curvature near the Fermi level. Furthermore, the ANE of the AFM YMn6Sn6 exceeds the magnetization scaling relationship of conventional ferromagnets. Our results clearly illustrate that AFM material YMn6Sn6 is an ideal topological material for room&#8208;temperature transverse thermoelectric applications.

Abstract
The learning and inference efficiencies of an artificial neural network represented by a cross&#8208;point synaptic memristor array can be achieved using a selector (1S), with high selectivity (Ion/Ioff) and sufficient death region, stacked vertically on a synaptic memristor (1&#160;M). This can prevent a sneak current in the memristor array. A selector with multiple jar&#8208;shaped conductive Cu filaments in the resistive switching layer was precisely fabricated by designing the Cu ion concentration depth profile of the CuGeSe layer as a filament source, TiN barrier layer, and Ge3Se7 switching layer. The selector performed super&#8208;linear&#8208;threshold&#8208;switching with a selectivity of &gt;&#160;107, death region of &#8722;0.70&#8211;0.65&#160;V, holding time of 300&#160;ns, switching speed of 25&#160;ns, and endurance cycle of &gt;&#160;106. In addition, the mechanism of switching was proven by the formation of conductive Cu filaments between the CuGeSe and Ge3Se7 layers under a positive bias on the top Pt electrode and an automatic rupture of the filaments after the holding time. Particularly, a spiking deep neural network using our designed 1S1M cross&#8208;point array improved the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology classification accuracy by &#8776; 3.8% by eliminating the sneak current in the cross&#8208;point array during the inference process.

         <title>Fingerprints Indicating Superior Properties of Internal Interfaces in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 Thin&#8208;Film Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;poor and Cu&#8208;rich Cu(In,Ga)Se2 absorbers are investigated using correlative microscopy based on the atom probe tomography technique. With that, typical fingerprints for superior properties of internal interfaces necessary for maintaining a lower recombination activity in the cell are discovered. These are Cu&#8208;depleted and Cd&#8208;enriched Cu(In,Ga)Se2 absorber surfaces, as well as negative Cu factor (&#8710;&#946;) and high Na content at the grain boundaries.








Abstract
Growth of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) absorbers under Cu&#8208;poor conditions gives rise to incorporation of numerous defects into the bulk, whereas the same absorber grown under Cu&#8208;rich conditions leads to a stoichiometric bulk with minimum defects. This suggests that CIGS absorbers grown under Cu&#8208;rich conditions are more suitable for solar cell applications. However, the CIGS solar cell devices with record efficiencies have all been fabricated under Cu&#8208;poor conditions, despite the expectations. Therefore, in the present work, both Cu&#8208;poor and Cu&#8208;rich CIGS cells are investigated, and the superior properties of the internal interfaces of the Cu&#8208;poor CIGS cells, such as the p&#8211;n junction and grain boundaries, which always makes them the record&#8208;efficiency devices, are shown. More precisely, by employing a correlative microscopy approach, the typical fingerprints for superior properties of internal interfaces necessary for maintaining a lower recombination activity in the cell is discovered. These are a Cu&#8208;depleted and Cd&#8208;enriched CIGS absorber surface, near the p&#8211;n junction, as well as&#160;a negative Cu factor (&#8710;&#946;) and high Na content (&gt;1.5 at%) at the grain boundaries. Thus, this work provides key factors governing the device performance (efficiency), which can be considered in the design of next&#8208;generation solar cells.

         <title>Ultrathin Suspended Chiral Metasurfaces for Enantiodiscrimination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;aligned suspended chiral bilayer metasurface is developed with single&#8208;step electron beam lithography. A huge optical chirality of 221&#176;&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1 is achieved by the freestanding metasurfaces with overall thickness of 100&#160;nm. The bilayer metasurface demonstrates label&#8208;free discrimination of chiral molecules at zeptomoles level with orders of magnitude larger than conventional circular dichroism spectroscopy.








Abstract
Chiral metasurfaces can exhibit a strong circular dichroism, but it is limited by the complicated fabrication procedure and alignment errors. Here, a new type of self&#8208;aligned suspended chiral bilayer metasurface with only one&#8208;step electron beam lithography exposure is demonstrated. A significant optical chirality of 221&#176;&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1 can be realized using suspended metasurfaces with a thickness of 100&#160;nm. Furthermore, this study experimentally demonstrates that such a structure is capable of label&#8208;free discrimination of the chiral molecules at zeptomole level, exhibiting a much higher sensitivity (orders of magnitude) compared to the conventional circular dichroism spectroscopy. The fundamental principles for chiral sensing using molecules&#8211;metasurfaces interactions are explored. Benefiting from the giant chiroptical response, the proposed metadevice may offer promising applications for ultrathin circular polarizers, chiral molecular detectors, and asymmetry information processing.

         <title>Noncovalent Polymerization&#8208;Activated Ultrastrong Near&#8208;Infrared Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Energy Transfer Assembly in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient noncovalent polymerization&#8208;activated phosphorescence&#8208;harvesting system is successfully constructed in aqueous solution based on the stepwise confinement of cucurbit[7]uril and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;grafted hyaluronic acid, which shows high phosphorescence energy transfer efficiency accompanied by a long&#8208;lived near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emitting performance, and is ultimately applied for NIR&#160;targeted imaging of cancer cells.








Abstract
Noncovalent macrocycle&#8208;confined supramolecular purely organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) is a current research hotspot. Herein, a high&#8208;efficiency noncovalent polymerization&#8208;activated near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;emissive RTP&#8208;harvesting system in aqueous solution based on the stepwise confinement of cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;grafted hyaluronic acid (HACD), is reported. Compared with the dodecyl&#8208;chain&#8208;bridged 6&#8208;bromoisoquinoline derivative (G), the dumbbell&#8208;shaped assembly G&#8834;CB[7] presents an appeared complexation&#8208;induced RTP signal at 540&#160;nm via the first confinement of CB[7]. Subsequently, benefitting from the stepwise confinement encapsulation of the &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin cavity, the subsequent noncovalent polymerization of the binary G&#8834;CB[7] assembly enabled by HACD can contribute to the further&#8208;enhanced RTP emission intensity approximately eight&#160;times in addition to an increased lifetime from 59.0&#160;&#181;s to 0.581&#160;ms.

&lt;p&gt;A highly efficient noncovalent polymerization-activated phosphorescence-harvesting system is successfully constructed in aqueous solution based on the stepwise confinement of cucurbit[7]uril and &#946;-cyclodextrin-grafted hyaluronic acid, which shows high phosphorescence energy transfer efficiency accompanied by a long-lived near-infrared (NIR) emitting performance, and is ultimately applied for NIR&#160;targeted imaging of cancer cells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noncovalent macrocycle-confined supramolecular purely organic room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) is a current research hotspot. Herein, a high-efficiency noncovalent polymerization-activated near-infrared (NIR)-emissive RTP-harvesting system in aqueous solution based on the stepwise confinement of cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) and &#946;-cyclodextrin-grafted hyaluronic acid (HACD), is reported. Compared with the dodecyl-chain-bridged 6-bromoisoquinoline derivative (G), the dumbbell-shaped assembly G&#8834;CB[7] presents an appeared complexation-induced RTP signal at 540&#160;nm via the first confinement of CB[7]. Subsequently, benefitting from the stepwise confinement encapsulation of the &#946;-cyclodextrin cavity, the subsequent noncovalent polymerization of the binary G&#8834;CB[7] assembly enabled by HACD can contribute to the further-enhanced RTP emission intensity approximately eight&#160;times in addition to an increased lifetime from 59.0&#160;&#181;s to 0.581&#160;ms. Moreover, upon doping a small amount of two types of organic dyes, Nile blue or tetrakis(4-sulfophenyl)porphyrin as an acceptor into the supramolecular confinement assembly G&#8834;CB[7]&#8202;@&#8202;HACD, efficient RTP energy transfer occurs accompanied by a long-lived NIR-emitting performance (680 and 710&#160;nm) with a high donor/acceptor ratio.

         <title>Integrated Three&#8208;dimensional Hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity Design for Artificial Sweating Skin (i&#8208;TRANS) Mimicking Human Body Perspiration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Artificial skins reproducing properties of human skin are emerging and significant for study in various areas, such as robotics, medicine, textiles, etc. Perspiration, as one of the most imperative thermoregulation functions of human skin, is gaining increasing attention, but how to realize ideal artificial skin for perspiration simulation remains challenging. Here, we propose an integrated three&#8208;dimensional hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity design for artificial sweating skin (i&#8208;TRANS). Based on normal fibrous wicking materials, the selective surface modification with gradient of Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) creates hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity contrast in both lateral and vertical directions. With the additional help of bottom hydrophilic Nylon 6 nanofibers, the constructed i&#8208;TRANS is able to transport &#8220;sweat&#8221; directionally without trapping undesired excess water and attain uniform &#8220;secretion&#8221; of sweat droplets on the top surface, decently mimicking human skin perspiration situation. This fairly comparable simulation not only presents new insights for replicating skin properties, but also provides proper in vitro testing platforms for perspiration&#8208;relevant research, greatly avoiding unwanted interference from the &#8220;skin&#8221; layer. In addition, the facile, fast and cost&#8208;effective fabrication approach and versatile usage of i&#8208;TRANS can further facilitate its application.

         <title>Tackling Disorder in &#947;&#8208;Ga2O3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) is attracting increasing attention in applications such as power electronics and photodetectors due to its rich structural space and resulting electronic structure. This work explores the influence of structural disorder on a range of crucial material parameters of &#947;&#8208;phase Ga2O3 by combining density functional theory and machine learning with a range of experimental probes.








Abstract
Ga2O3 and its polymorphs are attracting increasing attention. The rich structural space of polymorphic oxide systems such as Ga2O3 offers potential for electronic structure engineering, which is of particular interest for a range of applications, such as power electronics. &#947;&#8208;Ga2O3 presents a particular challenge across synthesis, characterization, and theory due to its inherent disorder and resulting complex structure&#8211;electronic&#8208;structure relationship. Here, density functional theory is used in combination with a machine&#8208;learning approach to screen nearly one million potential structures, thereby developing a robust atomistic model of the &#947;&#8208;phase. Theoretical results are compared with surface and bulk sensitive soft and hard X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, spectroscopic ellipsometry, and photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy experiments representative of the occupied and unoccupied states of &#947;&#8208;Ga2O3. The first onset of strong absorption at room temperature is found at 5.1&#160;eV from spectroscopic ellipsometry, which agrees well with the excitation maximum at 5.17&#160;eV obtained by photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy, where the latter shifts to 5.33&#160;eV at 5&#160;K. This work presents a leap forward in the treatment of complex, disordered oxides and is a crucial step toward exploring how their electronic structure can be understood in terms of local coordination and overall structure.

         <title>Wireless Miniature Magnetic Phase&#8208;Change Soft Actuators</title>

Abstract
Wireless miniature soft actuators are promising for various potential high&#8208;impact applications in medical, robotic grippers, and artificial muscles. However, these miniature soft actuators are currently constrained by a small output force and low work capacity. To address such challenges, we report a miniature magnetic phase&#8208;change soft composite actuator. This soft actuator exhibits an expanding deformation and enables up to a 70 N output force and 175.2 J/g work capacity under remote magnetic radio frequency heating, which are 106&#8211;107 times that of traditional magnetic soft actuators. To demonstrate its capabilities, we first design a wireless soft robotic device that can withstand 0.24 m/s fluid flows in an artery phantom. By integrating it with a thermally&#8208;responsive shape&#8208;memory polymer and bistable metamaterial sleeve, we design a wireless reversible bistable stent towards for future potential angioplasty applications. Moreover, it can additionally locomote inside and jump out of granular media. At last, the phase&#8208;change actuator can realize programmable bending deformations when a specifically designed magnetization profile is encoded, enhancing its shape&#8208;programming capability. Such a miniature soft actuator provides an approach to enhance the mechanical output and versatility of magnetic soft robots and devices, extending their medical and other potential applications.

         <title>&#8220;Red Carbon&#8221;: A Rediscovered Covalent Crystalline Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Carbon suboxide (C3O2) is a unique molecule able to polymerize spontaneously into highly conjugated light&#8208;absorbing structures at temperatures as low as 0 &#176;C. Despite obvious advantages, little is known about the nature and the functional properties of this carbonaceous material. In this work, we aim to bring &#8220;red carbon&#8221;, a forgotten polymeric semiconductor, back to the community's attention. A solution polymerization process is adapted to simplify the synthesis and control the structure. This allows us to obtain this crystalline covalent material at low temperatures. Both spectroscopic and elemental analyses support the chemical structure represented as conjugated ladder polypyrone ribbons. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest a crystalline structure of AB stacks of polypyrone ribbons and identify the material as a direct bandgap semiconductor with a medium bandgap that is further confirmed by optical analysis. The material shows promising photocatalytic performance using blue light. Moreover, the simple condensation&#8208;aromatization route described here allows the straightforward fabrication of conjugated ladder polymers and could be inspiring for the synthesis of carbonaceous materials at low temperatures in general.

Abstract
Skyrmion helicity, which defines the spin swirling direction, is a fundamental parameter that may be utilized to encode data bits in future memory devices. Generally, in centrosymmetric ferromagnets, dipole skyrmions with helicity of &#8722;&#960;/2 and &#960;/2 are degenerate in energy, leading to equal populations of both helicities. On the other hand, in chiral materials where the Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction (DMI) is prevailing and the dipolar interaction is negligible, only a preferred helicity is selected by the type of DMI. However, whether there is a rigid boundary between these two regimes remains an open question. Herein, we report the observation of dipole skyrmions with unconventional helicity polarization in a van der Waals ferromagnet Fe5&#8722;&#948;GeTe2. Combining magnetometry, Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, electrical transport measurements, and micromagnetic simulations, we demonstrate that the short&#8208;range superstructures in Fe5&#8722;&#948;GeTe2 results in a localized DMI contribution, which breaks the degeneracy of the opposite helicities and leads to the helicity polarization. Therefore, the helicity feature in Fe5&#8722;&#948;GeTe2 is controlled by both the dipolar interaction and DMI that the former leads to Bloch&#8208;type skyrmions with helicity of &#177;&#960;/2 whereas the latter breaks the helicity degeneracy. This work provides new insights into the skyrmion topology in van der Waals materials.

         <title>Shaping 90 wt% NanoMOFs into Robust Multifunctional Aerogels Using Tailored Bio&#8208;Based Nanofibrils</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel sustainable material strategy is reported to fabricate wet&#8208;stable, mechanically robust, and elastic multifunctional nanoMOF&#8208;CNF aerogels with the highest reported nanoMOF loading of 90&#160;wt%, enabled by high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio cationic CNFs. The carbonized and non&#8208;carbonized aerogels are effectively demonstrated for water purification, CO2 and CH4 gas storage and separation, flame retardancy, and energy storage.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are hybrid porous crystalline networks with tunable chemical and structural properties. However, their excellent potential is limited in practical applications by their hard&#8208;to&#8208;shape powder form, making it challenging to assemble MOFs into macroscopic composites with mechanical integrity. While a binder matrix enables hybrid materials, such materials have a limited MOF content and thus limited functionality. To overcome this challenge, nanoMOFs are combined with tailored same&#8208;charge high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) to manufacture robust, wet&#8208;stable, and multifunctional MOF&#8208;based aerogels with 90 wt% nanoMOF loading. The porous aerogel architectures show excellent potential for practical applications such as efficient water purification, CO2 and CH4 gas adsorption and separation, and fire&#8208;safe insulation. Moreover, a one&#8208;step carbonization process enables these aerogels as effective structural energy&#8208;storage electrodes. This work exhibits the unique ability of high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio CNFs to bind large amounts of nanoMOFs in structured materials with outstanding mechanical integrity&#8212;a quality that is preserved even after carbonization. The demonstrated process is simple and fully discloses the intrinsic potential of the nanoMOFs, resulting in synergetic properties not found in the components alone, thus paving the way for MOFs in macroscopic multifunctional composites.

         <title>Dramatic Enhancement of Thermoelectric Performance in PbTe by Unconventional Grain Shrinking in the Sintering Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared with the traditional grain growth of pristine PbTe, a cleavage&#8208;fracture strategy for grain shrinking is developed in a Pb0.98Sb0.02Te sample during sintering. A hierarchical grain&#8208;boundary structure forms during grain shrinking process and a record&#8208;high ZT value of &#8776;1.9 is obtained at 815 K, which is &#8776;2.2 times that of pristine PbTe.








Abstract
Nanostructure engineering is a key strategy for tailoring properties in the fields of batteries, solar cells, thermoelectrics, and so on. Limited by grain coarsening, however, the nanostructure effect gradually degrades during the materials&#8217; manufacturing and in&#8208;service period. Herein, a strategy of cleavage&#8208;fracture for grain shrinking is developed in a Pb0.98Sb0.02Te sample during sintering, and the grain size remains stable after repeated tests. Moreover, the initial grain boundary is filled by fractured slender grains and enriched by dislocations, evolving into a hierarchical grain&#8208;boundary structure. The lattice thermal conductivity (klat) is greatly reduced to approach the amorphous limit. As a result, a record&#8208;high ZT value of &#8776;1.9 is obtained at 815 K in the n&#8208;type Pb0.98Sb0.02Te sample and a decent efficiency of 6.7% in thermoelectric device. This strategy for grain shrinking will shed light on the application of nanostructure engineering under high temperature and extreme conditions in other material systems.

         <title>In Situ Characterization of the Protein Corona of Nanoparticles In Vitro and In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Most standard characterization techniques cannot capture the subtle complexity of the protein corona. A novel approach using differential dynamic microscopy (DDM) on a simple fluorescence microscope makes possible simultaneous measurements of protein adsorption, particle size, and fractal dimension of aggregates. The new insights obtained from this technique shed light on the protein corona (PC) complexity within in vitro and in vivo setups.








Abstract
A new theoretical framework that enables the use of differential dynamic microscopy (DDM) in fluorescence imaging mode to quantify in situ protein adsorption onto nanoparticles (NP) while simultaneously monitoring for NP aggregation is proposed. This methodology is used to elucidate the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the protein corona (PC) in vitro and in vivo. The results show that protein adsorption triggers particle aggregation over a wide concentration range and that the formed aggregate structures can be quantified using the proposed methodology. Protein affinity for polystyrene (PS) NPs is observed to be dependent on particle concentration. For complex protein mixtures, this methodology identifies that the PC composition changes with the dilution of serum proteins, demonstrating a Vroman effect never quantitatively assessed in situ on NPs. Finally, DDM allows monitoring of the evolution of the PC in vivo. This results show that the PC composition evolves significantly over time in zebrafish larvae, confirming the inherently dynamic nature of the PC. The performance of the developed methodology allows to obtain quantitative insights into nano&#8208;bio interactions in a vast array of physiologically relevant conditions that will serve to further improve the design of nanomedicine.

         <title>In Situ Growth of Covalent Organic Framework Nanosheets on Graphene as the Cathode for Long&#8208;Life High&#8208;Capacity Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sophisticated covalent organic framework (COF)&#160;predesign and synthetic strategy, with the assistance of materials processing technology, results in a new COF&#8208;based high&#8208;performance organic cathode for practical lithium&#8208;ion batteries, with a specific capacity of 285&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at current density of 0.2&#160;C, and retained capacity of 170&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 after 6000 cycles at 5&#160;C.








Abstract
The poor electronic and ionic conductivities of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) severely restrict the development of COF&#8208;based electrodes for practical rechargeable batteries, therefore inspiring more research interest from the direction of both material synthesis and technology. Herein, a dual&#8208;porous COF, USTB&#8208;6, with good crystallinity and rich redox&#8208;active sites is conceived and fabricated by the polymerization of 2,3,8,9,14,15&#8208;hexa(4&#8208;formylphenyl)diquinoxalino [2,3&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine and 2,7&#8208;diaminopyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone. In particular, the heterogeneous polymerization of the same starting materials in the presence of graphene affords uniformly dispersed COF nanosheets with a thickness of 8.3&#160;nm on a conductive carbon substrate, effectively enhancing the electronic conductivity of the COF&#8208;based electrode. Such a graphene&#8208;supported USTB&#8208;6 nanosheets cathode when used in a lithium&#8208;ion battery exhibits a specific capacity of 285&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 0.2&#160;C and excellent rate performance with a prominent capacity of 188&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10&#160;C. More importantly, a capacity of 170&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 is retained by using the USTB&#8208;6 nanosheets cathode after 6000 cycles charge and discharge measurement at 5&#160;C.

&lt;p&gt;The poor electronic and ionic conductivities of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) severely restrict the development of COF-based electrodes for practical rechargeable batteries, therefore inspiring more research interest from the direction of both material synthesis and technology. Herein, a dual-porous COF, USTB-6, with good crystallinity and rich redox-active sites is conceived and fabricated by the polymerization of 2,3,8,9,14,15-hexa(4-formylphenyl)diquinoxalino [2,3-a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;-&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;]phenazine and 2,7-diaminopyrene-4,5,9,10-tetraone. In particular, the heterogeneous polymerization of the same starting materials in the presence of graphene affords uniformly dispersed COF nanosheets with a thickness of 8.3&#160;nm on a conductive carbon substrate, effectively enhancing the electronic conductivity of the COF-based electrode. Such a graphene-supported USTB-6 nanosheets cathode when used in a lithium-ion battery exhibits a specific capacity of 285&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at a current density of 0.2&#160;C and excellent rate performance with a prominent capacity of 188&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 10&#160;C. More importantly, a capacity of 170&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; is retained by using the USTB-6 nanosheets cathode after 6000 cycles charge and discharge measurement at 5&#160;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlocking Layered Double Hydroxide as a High&#8208;Performance Cathode Material for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trinary layered double hydroxide (LDH) with hydrogen vacancies is proposed as a new cathode material for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. With the existence of H vacancies and the synergy of trinary transitional metal cations in LDH, the electrode exhibits a high reversible capacity of 328 mAh g&#8722;1 and excellent cycling stability over 500 cycles with a capacity retention of 85%.








Abstract
Advanced cathode materials play an important role in promoting aqueous battery technology for safe energy storage. Transition metal double hydroxides are usually elusive as a stable cathode for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) due to their unstable crystal structure, sluggish ion transportation, and insufficient active sites for zinc&#8208;ion storage. Here, a trinary layered double hydroxide (LDH) with hydrogen vacancies (Ni3Mn0.7Fe0.3&#8208;LDH) is reported as a new cathode material for AZIBs. A reversible high capacity up to 328 mAh g&#8722;1 can be obtained and cycle stably over 500 cycles with a capacity retention of 85%. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the hydrogen vacancies in LDH can expose lattice oxygen atoms as active sites for zinc&#8208;ion storage and accelerate ion diffusion by reducing the electrostatic interactions between zinc ions and the host structure. In addition, the synergy of the trinary transitional metal cations can suppress the Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion of manganese (III) oxide octahedron and enable long cycle stability. This work provides not only a series of high&#8208;performance cathode materials for AZIBs but also a novel materials design strategy that can be extended to other multi&#8208;valence metal&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Enhanced Photoconductivity at Dislocations in SrTiO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dislocations can boost the photoconductivity in oxide semiconductors. Well&#8208;ordered, high&#8208;density dislocation arrays dedicatedly produced in Fe&#8208;doped SrTiO3 single crystals show manyfold increased photoconductivity in the regions around dislocation compared to the dislocation free regions of the sample.








Abstract
Dislocations are 1D crystallographic line defects and are usually seen as detrimental to the functional properties of classic semiconductors. It is shown here that this not necessarily accounts for oxide semiconductors in which dislocations are capable of boosting the photoconductivity. Strontium titanate single crystals are controllably deformed to generate a high density of ordered dislocations of two slip systems possessing different mesoscopic arrangements. For both slip systems, nanoscale conductive atomic force microscope investigations reveal a strong enhancement of the photoconductivity around the dislocation cores. Macroscopic in&#8208;plane measurements indicate that the two dislocation systems result in different global photoconductivity behavior despite the similar local enhancement. Depending on the arrangement, the global photoresponse can be increased by orders of magnitude. Additionally, indications for a bulk photovoltaic effect enabled by dislocation&#8208;surrounding strain fields are observed for the first time. This proves that dislocations in oxide semiconductors can be of large interest for tailoring photoelectric functionalities. Direct evidence that electronic transport is confined to the dislocation core points to a new emerging research field.

         <title>Three&#8208;Tier Hierarchical Structures for Extreme Pool Boiling Heat Transfer Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extreme pool boiling performance is achieved by manipulating liquid&#8211;vapor transport at three length scales by engineering surface structures: 1) at millimeter scale, bubble coalescence is minimized and the complete capillary wicking is exploited with separated nucleation sites, 2) at micrometer scale, microcavities promote vapor nucleation, and 3) at nanometer scale, nanostructures extend the liquid&#8211;vapor interface for enhanced evaporation.








Abstract
Boiling is an effective energy&#8208;transfer process with substantial utility in energy applications. Boiling performance is described mainly by the heat&#8208;transfer coefficient (HTC) and critical heat flux (CHF). Recent efforts for the simultaneous enhancement of HTC and CHF have been limited by an intrinsic trade&#8208;off between them&#8212;HTC enhancement requires high nucleation&#8208;site density, which can increase bubble coalescence resulting in limited CHF enhancement. In this work, this trade&#8208;off is overcome by designing three&#8208;tier hierarchical structures. The bubble coalescence is minimized to enhance the CHF by defining nucleation sites with microcavities interspersed within hemi&#8208;wicking structures. Meanwhile, the reduced nucleation&#8208;site density is compensated for by incorporating nanostructures that promote evaporation for HTC enhancement. The hierarchical structures demonstrate the simultaneous enhancement of HTC and CHF up to 389% and 138%, respectively, compared to a smooth surface. This extreme boiling performance can lead to significant energy savings in a variety of boiling applications.

         <title>Green Electrosynthesis of 5,5&#8242;&#8208;Azotetrazolate Energetic Materials Plus Energy&#8208;Efficient Hydrogen Production Using Ruthenium Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique coupling system for energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production and green electrosynthesis of energetic materials (EMs) is developed. The coupling system displays an ultralow cell voltage of 1.35&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, representing a reduction of 410&#160;mV relative to overall water splitting. This strategy solves the problems of high&#8208;energy&#8208;consumption hydrogen production and the hazardous traditional synthesis conditions of EMs.








Abstract
Water electrolysis involves two parallel reactions, that is, oxygen evolution (OER) and hydrogen evolution (HER), in which sluggish OER is a significant limiting step that results in high energy consumption. Coupling the thermodynamically favorable electrooxidation of organic alternatives to value&#8208;added fine chemicals HER is a promising approach for the simultaneous cost&#8208;effective production of value&#8208;added chemicals and hydrogen. Here, a new coupling system for the green electrochemical synthesis of organic energetic materials (EMs) plus hydrogen production using single&#8208;atom catalysts is introduced. The catalysts are prepared by the facile galvanostatic deposition of ruthenium single atoms on the molybdenum selenide and reveal a low HER overpotential of 38.9&#160;mV at &#8722;10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in an alkaline medium. Importantly, the cell voltage of water electrolysis can be significantly reduced to only 1.35&#160;V at a current of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 by coupling water splitting with the electrooxidation of 5&#8208;amino&#8208;1H&#8208;tetrazole to synthesize 5,5&#8242;&#8208;azotetrazolate energetic material. These materials are traditionally synthesized under harsh conditions involving a strong oxidizing agent, high&#8208;temperature conditions, and difficult separation of by&#8208;products. This study provides a green and efficient method of synthesizing organic EMs while simultaneously producing hydrogen.

Solid&#8208;state batteries created by in situ polymerization of a liquid monomer provide a path toward practical electrochemical cells in flexible form factors. In this work, the synthesis and electrochemical properties of hybrid solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes formed inside a battery cell using ring&#8208;opening polymerization of DOL&#8208;nanoparticle suspensions are reported. The electrolytes are evaluated in battery cells utilizing both intercalation and conversion cathodes.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) formed inside an electrochemical cell by polymerization of a liquid precursor provide a promising strategy for overcoming problems with electrolyte wetting in solid&#8208;state batteries. Hybrid solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (HSPEs) created by in situ polymerization of a conventional liquid precursor containing electrochemically inert nanostructures are of particular interest because they offer a mechanism for selectively reinforcing or adding&#160;new&#160;functionalities&#160;to the electrolyte&#8212;removing the need for high degrees of polymerization. The synthesis, structure, chemical kinetics,&#160;ion&#8208;transport&#160;properties&#160;and electrochemical characteristics of HSPEs created by Al(OTf)3&#8208;initiated polymerization of 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (DOL) containing hairy, nano&#8208;sized SiO2&#160;particles are reported. Small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering reveals the particles are well&#8208;dispersed in&#160;liquid&#160;DOL. Strong interaction between poly(ethylene glycol) molecules tethered to the SiO2&#160;particles and poly(DOL) lead to co&#8208;crystallization&#8212;anchoring the nanoparticles in their host It also enables polymerization&#8211;depolymerization processes in DOL to be studied and controlled. The utility of the in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed HSPE, is demonstrated first in Li|HSPE|Cu half cells, which manifest Coulombic efficiencies (CE) values approaching 99%. HSPEs are also demonstrated in solid&#8208;state lithium&#8211;sulfur&#8211;polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) composite full&#8208;cell batteries. The in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed Li|HSPE|SPAN cells show good cycling stability and thus provide a promising path toward all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Magneto&#8211;Electric&#8211;Optical Coupling in Multiferroic BiFeO3&#8208;Based Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magneto&#8211;electric&#8211;optical coupling is realized in multiferroic BiFeO3&#8208;based films at room temperature by engineering ferroelastic switching. The reversible ferroelastic switching is ubiquitous in BiFeO3&#8208;based films with flexible strain states and domain patterns, which is determined by the photoinduced electric field and symmetry mismatch in films. This work provides a framework for multi&#8208;field&#8208;driven magnetoelectric memories with low power consumption.








Abstract
Manipulating ferroic orders and realizing their coupling in multiferroics at room temperature are promising for designing future multifunctional devices. Single external stimulation has been extensively proved to demonstrate the ability of ferroelastic switching in multiferroic oxides, which is crucial to bridge the ferroelectricity and magnetism. However, it is still challenging to directly realize multi&#8208;field&#8208;driven magnetoelectric coupling in multiferroic oxides as potential multifunctional electrical devices. Here, novel magneto&#8211;electric&#8211;optical coupling in multiferroic BiFeO3&#8208;based thin films at room temperature mediated by deterministic ferroelastic switching using piezoresponse/magnetic force microscopy and aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy are shown. Reversible photoinduced ferroelastic switching exhibiting magnetoelectric responses is confirmed in BiFeO3&#8208;based films, which works at flexible strain states. This work directly demonstrates room&#8208;temperature magneto&#8211;electric&#8211;optical coupling in multiferroic films, which provides a framework for designing potential multi&#8208;field&#8208;driven magnetoelectric devices such as energy conservation memories.

         <title>Not All Aggregates Are Made the Same: Distinct Structures of Solution Aggregates Drastically Modulate Assembly Pathways, Morphology, and Electronic Properties of Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solution aggregate structures of an isoindigo&#8211;bithiophene&#8208;based polymer (PII&#8208;2T) are largely tuned by varying the solvent selectivity toward the backbone versus side chains. This results in three distinct assembly pathways and thin&#8208;film morphologies. Surprisingly, amorphous network aggregates outcompete semicrystalline ones to give rise to highly ordered and aligned morphology and enhanced charge&#8208;transport properties.








Abstract
Tuning structures of solution&#8208;state aggregation and aggregation&#8208;mediated assembly pathways of conjugated polymers is crucial for optimizing their solid&#8208;state morphology and charge&#8208;transport property. However, it remains challenging to unravel and control the exact structures of solution aggregates, let alone to modulate assembly pathways in a controlled fashion. Herein, aggregate structures of an isoindigo&#8211;bithiophene&#8208;based polymer (PII&#8208;2T) are modulated by tuning selectivity of the solvent toward the side chain versus the backbone, which leads to three distinct assembly pathways: direct crystallization from side&#8208;chain&#8208;associated amorphous aggregates, chiral liquid crystal (LC)&#8208;mediated assembly from semicrystalline aggregates with side&#8208;chain and backbone stacking, and random agglomeration from backbone&#8208;stacked semicrystalline aggregates. Importantly, it is demonstrated that the amorphous solution aggregates, compared with semicrystalline ones, lead to significantly improved alignment and reduced paracrystalline disorder in the solid state due to direct crystallization during the meniscus&#8208;guided coating process. Alignment quantified by the dichroic ratio is enhanced by up to 14&#8208;fold, and the charge&#8208;carrier mobility increases by a maximum of 20&#8208;fold in films printed from amorphous aggregates compared to those from semicrystalline aggregates. This work shows that by tuning the precise structure of solution aggregates, the assembly pathways and the resulting thin&#8208;film morphology and device properties can be drastically tuned.

         <title>Geometric Phase and Localized Heat Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological thermal metamaterials are presented. An accurate theoretical framework is established to study the geometric phase and dynamics of the thermal lattices. The topological properties of diffusive systems and localized heat diffusion protected by the topological edge states are revealed. The work can be applied to facilitate the heat dissipation of hot spots.








Abstract
Many unusual wave phenomena in artificial structures are governed by their topological properties. However, the topology of diffusion remains almost unexplored. One reason is that diffusion is fundamentally different from wave propagation because of its purely dissipative nature. The other is that the diffusion field is mostly composed of modes that extend over wide ranges, making it difficult to be rendered within the tight&#8208;binding theory as commonly employed in wave physics. Here, the above challenges are overcome and systematic studies are performed on the topology of heat diffusion. Based on a continuum model, the band structure and geometric phase are analytically obtained without using the tight&#8208;binding approximation. A deterministic parameter is found to link the geometric phase with the edge state, thereby proving the bulk&#8208;boundary correspondence for heat diffusion. The topological edge state is experimentally demonstrated as localized heat diffusion and its dependence on the boundary conditions is verified. This approach is general, rigorous, and able to reveal rich knowledge about the system with great accuracy. The findings set up a solid foundation to explore the topology in novel thermal management applications.

         <title>Semi&#8208;Immobilized Ionic Liquid Regulator with Fast Kinetics toward Highly Stable Zinc Anode under &#8722;35 to 60&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semi&#8208;immobilized ionic liquid interface layer is designed to protect the Zn anode from &#8722;35 to 60&#160;&#176;C. The protective layer not only promotes Zn2+ desolvation and transport but also regulates Zn2+ concentration gradient and electric field to guarantee uniform Zn deposition. With this novel semi&#8208;immobilized coating technique, highly stable zinc batteries are fabricated and can be operated over a wide temperature range.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) have been extensively investigated as a next&#8208;generation energy storage system due to their high safety and low cost. However, the critical issues of irregular dendrite growth and intricate side reactions severely restrict the further industrialization of ZIBs. Here, a strategy to fabricate a semi&#8208;immobilized ionic liquid interface layer is proposed to protect the Zn anode over a wide temperature range from &#8722;35&#160;to 60&#160;&#176;C. The immobilized SiO2@cation can form high conjugate racks that can regulate the Zn2+ concentration gradient and self&#8208;polarizing electric field to guarantee uniform nucleation and planar deposition; the free anions of the ILs can weaken the hydrogen bonds of the water to promote rapid Zn2+ desolvation and accelerate ion&#8208;transport kinetics simultaneously. Because of these unique advantages, the cycling performance of the symmetric Zn batteries is greatly enhanced, evidenced by a cycling life of 1800&#160;h at 20&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, and a cycle lifespan of 2000&#160;h under a wide temperature window from &#8722;35&#160;to 60&#160;&#176;C.

     alt="Semi-Immobilized Ionic Liquid Regulator with Fast Kinetics toward Highly Stable Zinc Anode under &#8722;35 to 60&#160;&#176;C"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A semi-immobilized ionic liquid interface layer is designed to protect the Zn anode from &#8722;35 to 60&#160;&#176;C. The protective layer not only promotes Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; desolvation and transport but also regulates Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration gradient and electric field to guarantee uniform Zn deposition. With this novel semi-immobilized coating technique, highly stable zinc batteries are fabricated and can be operated over a wide temperature range.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) have been extensively investigated as a next-generation energy storage system due to their high safety and low cost. However, the critical issues of irregular dendrite growth and intricate side reactions severely restrict the further industrialization of ZIBs. Here, a strategy to fabricate a semi-immobilized ionic liquid interface layer is proposed to protect the Zn anode over a wide temperature range from &#8722;35&#160;to 60&#160;&#176;C. The immobilized SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@cation can form high conjugate racks that can regulate the Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration gradient and self-polarizing electric field to guarantee uniform nucleation and planar deposition; the free anions of the ILs can weaken the hydrogen bonds of the water to promote rapid Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; desolvation and accelerate ion-transport kinetics simultaneously. Because of these unique advantages, the cycling performance of the symmetric Zn batteries is greatly enhanced, evidenced by a cycling life of 1800&#160;h at 20&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and a cycle lifespan of 2000&#160;h under a wide temperature window from &#8722;35&#160;to 60&#160;&#176;C. The efficiency of this semi-immobilizing strategy is well demonstrated in various full cells including pouch cells, showing high performance at large current (20&#160;A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and wide temperatures with extra-long cycles up to 80&#8201;000&#160;cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nonvolatile Control of Metal&#8211;Insulator Transition in VO2 by Ferroelectric Gating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach to control a metal&#8211;insulator transition (MIT) behavior in a vanadium dioxide is demonstrated by employing the heteroepitaxial Mott transistor. Due to the defect&#8208;alleviated interfaces, the enhanced coupling between the correlated electrons and ferroelectricity is successfully proven by showing a nonvolatile MIT behavior through the reversible memory performance.








Abstract
Controlling phase transitions in correlated materials yields emergent functional properties, providing new aspects to future electronics and a fundamental understanding of condensed matter systems. With vanadium dioxide (VO2), a representative correlated material, an approach to control a metal&#8211;insulator transition (MIT) behavior is developed by employing a heteroepitaxial structure with a ferroelectric BiFeO3 (BFO) layer to modulate the interaction of correlated electrons. Owing to the defect&#8208;alleviated interfaces, the enhanced coupling between the correlated electrons and ferroelectric polarization is successfully demonstrated by showing a nonvolatile control of MIT of VO2 at room temperature. The ferroelectrically&#8208;tunable MIT can be realized through the Mott transistor (VO2/BFO/SrRuO3) with a remanent polarization of 80 &#181;C cm&#8722;2, leading to a nonvolatile MIT behavior through the reversible electrical conductance with a large on/off ratio (&#8776;102), long retention time (&#8776;104 s), and high endurance (&#8776;103 cycles). Furthermore, the structural phase transition of VO2 is corroborated by ferroelectric polarization through in situ Raman mapping analysis. This study provides novel design principles for heteroepitaxial correlated materials and innovative insight to modulate multifunctional properties.

Abstract
Cu3(HHTT)2 (HHTT: 2,3,7,8,12,13&#8208;hexahydroxytetraazanaphthotetraphene) is a novel 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic framework (2D c&#8208;MOF) with efficient in&#8208;plane d&#8211;&#960; conjugations and strong interlayer &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions while the growth of Cu3(HHTT)2 thin films has never been reported until now. Here, the successful fabrication of highly oriented wafer&#8208;scale Cu3(HHTT)2 thin films with a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth method on various substrates is presented. Its semiconducting behavior and carrier transport mechanisms are clarified through temperature and frequency&#8208;dependent conductivity measurements. Flexible photodetectors based on Cu3(HHTT)2 thin films exhibit reliable photoresponses at room temperature in a wavelength region from UV to mid&#8208;IR, which is much broader than those of solution&#8208;processed broadband photodetectors reported previously. Moreover, the photodetectors can show a typical synaptic behavior and excellent data recognition accuracy in artificial neural networks. This work opens a window for the exploration of high&#8208;performance and multifunctional optoelectronic devices based on 2D c&#8208;MOFs.

Abstract
Metal patterning via additive manufacturing has been phasing&#8208;in to broad applications in many medical, electronics, aerospace, and automotive industries. While previous efforts have produced various promising metal&#8208;patterning strategies, their complexity and high cost have limited their practical application in rapid production and prototyping. Herein, a one&#8208;step gold printing technique based on anion&#8208;assisted photochemical deposition (APD), which can directly print highly conductive gold patterns (1.08 &#215; 107 S m&#8722;1) under ambient conditions without post&#8208;annealing treatment, is introduced. Uniquely, the APD uses specific ion effects with projection lithography to pattern Au nanoparticles and simultaneously sinter them into tunable porous gold structures. The significant influence of kosmotropic or chaotropic anions in the precursor ink on tuning the morphologies and conductivities of the printed patterns by employing a series of different ions, including Cl&#8722; ions, in the printing process is presented. Additionally, the resistance stabilities and the electrochemical properties of the APD&#8208;printed gold patterns are carefully investigated. The high conductivity and excellent conformability of the printed Au electrodes are demonstrated with reliable performance in electrophysiological signal delivery and acquisition for biomedical applications. This work exploits the potential of photochemical&#8208;deposition&#8208;based metal patterning in flexible electronic manufacturing.

         <title>Achieving 19% Power Conversion Efficiency in Planar&#8208;Mixed Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells Using a Pseudosymmetric Electron Acceptor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pseudosymmetric electron acceptor, BS3TSe&#8208;4F, designed from asymmetric selenium substitution strategy promotes free charge generation to enhance exciton dissociation and suppress energy loss in sequentially processed organic solar cells, leading to a record power conversion efficiency of over 19%.








Abstract
A record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 19% is realized in planar&#8208;mixed heterojunction (PMHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) by adopting the asymmetric selenium substitution strategy in making a pseudosymmetric electron acceptor, BS3TSe&#8208;4F. The combined molecular asymmetry with more polarizable selenium substitution increases the dielectric constant of the D18/BS3TSe&#8208;4F blend, helping lower the exciton binding energy. On the other hand, dimer packing in BS3TSe&#8208;4F is facilitated to enable free charge generation, helping more efficient exciton dissociation and lowering the radiative recombination loss (&#916;E2) of OSCs. As a result, PMHJ OSCs based on D18/BS3TSe&#8208;4F achieve a PCE of 18.48%. By incorporating another mid&#8208;bandgap acceptor Y6&#8208;O into D18/BS3TSe&#8208;4F to form a ternary PMHJ, a higher open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) can be achieved to realize an impressive PCE of 19.03%.

&lt;p&gt;A pseudosymmetric electron acceptor, BS3TSe-4F, designed from asymmetric selenium substitution strategy promotes free charge generation to enhance exciton dissociation and suppress energy loss in sequentially processed organic solar cells, leading to a record power conversion efficiency of over 19%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 19% is realized in planar-mixed heterojunction (PMHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) by adopting the asymmetric selenium substitution strategy in making a pseudosymmetric electron acceptor, BS3TSe-4F. The combined molecular asymmetry with more polarizable selenium substitution increases the dielectric constant of the D18/BS3TSe-4F blend, helping lower the exciton binding energy. On the other hand, dimer packing in BS3TSe-4F is facilitated to enable free charge generation, helping more efficient exciton dissociation and lowering the radiative recombination loss (&#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) of OSCs. As a result, PMHJ OSCs based on D18/BS3TSe-4F achieve a PCE of 18.48%. By incorporating another mid-bandgap acceptor Y6-O into D18/BS3TSe-4F to form a ternary PMHJ, a higher open-circuit voltage (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;) can be achieved to realize an impressive PCE of 19.03%. The findings of using pseudosymmetric electron acceptors in enhancing device efficiency provides an effective way to develop highly efficient acceptor materials for OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ion&#8211;Dipole Interaction Regulation Enables High&#8208;Performance Single&#8208;Ion Polymer Conductors for Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;ion polymer conductor (SIPC) with exceptional selectivity for lithium (Li)&#8208;ion conduction is synthesized. The optimized ion&#8211;dipole interactions between Li&#8208;ions and carbonyl/cyano groups in the SIPC enable a high ionic conductivity, large Li&#8208;ion transference number, and wide electrochemical stability window. Solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries based on the SIPC exhibit superb cycling performance at various current densities and temperatures.








Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes with large ionic conductivity, high ionic transference number, and good interfacial compatibility with electrodes are highly desired for solid&#8208;state batteries. However, unwanted polarizations and side reactions occurring in traditional dual&#8208;ion polymer conductors hinder their practical applications. Here, single&#8208;ion polymer conductors (SIPCs) with exceptional selectivity for Li&#8208;ion conduction (Li&#8208;ion transference number up to 0.93), high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of about 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1, and a wide electrochemical stability window (&gt;4.5&#160;V, vs Li/Li+) are prepared by precisely regulating the ion&#8211;dipole interactions between Li+ and carbonyl/cyano groups. The resulting SIPCs show an excellent electrochemical stability with Li metal during long&#8208;term cycling at room temperature and 60&#160;&#176;C. LiFePO4&#8208;based solid&#8208;state cells containing the SIPCs exhibit good rate and cycling performance in a wide temperature range from &#8722;20 to 90&#160;&#176;C. By the same way of ion&#8211;dipole interaction regulation, sodium&#8208; and potassium&#8208;based SIPCs with both high ionic conductivity and high cationic transference numbers are also prepared. The findings in this work provide guidance for the development of high&#8208;performance SIPCs and other metal&#8208;ion systems beyond Li+.

         <title>High&#8208;Stretchability, Ultralow&#8208;Hysteresis ConductingPolymer Hydrogel Strain Sensors for Soft Machines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conducting&#8208;polymer hydrogel strain sensor is proposed with both high stretchability (300% strain) and ultralow hysteresis (&lt;1.5%). The hydrogel&#8208;based sensor harnesses a unique microphase semiseparated network to achieve enhanced sensing properties. The fabricated sensor can be applied as electronic skins to monitor physiological signals, enable a soft gripper for object recognition and remote control of an industrial robot.








Abstract
Highly stretchable strain sensors based on conducting polymer hydrogel are rapidly emerging as a promising candidate toward diverse wearable skins and sensing devices for soft machines. However, due to the intrinsic limitations of low stretchability and large hysteresis, existing strain sensors cannot fully exploit their potential when used in wearable or robotic systems. Here, a conducting&#160;polymer hydrogel strain sensor exhibiting both ultimate strain (300%) and negligible hysteresis (&lt;1.5%) is presented. This is achieved through a unique microphase semiseparated network design by compositing poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) nanofibers with poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and facile fabrication by combining 3D printing and successive freeze&#8208;thawing. The overall superior performances of the strain sensor including stretchability, linearity, cyclic stability, and robustness against mechanical twisting and pressing are systematically characterized. The integration and application of such strain sensor with electronic skins are further demonstrated to measure various physiological signals, identify hand gestures, enable a soft gripper for objection recognition, and remote control of an industrial robot. This work may offer both promising conducting polymer hydrogels with enhanced sensing functionalities and technical platforms toward stretchable electronic skins and intelligent robotic systems.

         <title>Superior Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries Enabled by the High&#8208;Speed Solid&#8208;State Lithium Transport of an Intermetallic Cu6Sn5 Network</title>

         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;speed solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;transport matrix throughout the electrode is built up by a LixCu6Sn5 intermetallic network, which largely reduces the polarization effect in the graphite anode and realizes superior fast&#8208;charging graphite/lithium cobalt oxide full cells under strict electrode conditions (areal capacity &gt;3 mAh cm&#8722;2, porosity &lt; 35%).








Abstract
Superior fast charging is a desirable capability of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, which can make electric vehicles a strong competition to traditional fuel vehicles. However, the slow transport of solvated lithium ions in liquid electrolytes is a limiting factor. Here, a LixCu6Sn5 intermetallic network is reported to address this issue. Based on electrochemical analysis and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy mapping, it is demonstrated that the reported intermetallic network can form a high&#8208;speed solid&#8208;state lithium transport matrix throughout the electrode, which largely reduces the lithium&#8208;ion&#8208;concentration polarization effect in the graphite anode. Employing this design, superior fast&#8208;charging graphite/lithium cobalt oxide full cells are fabricated and tested under strict electrode conditions. At the charging rate of 6 C, the fabricated full cells show a capacity of 145 mAh g&#8722;1 with an extraordinary capacity retention of 96.6%. In addition, the full cell also exhibits good electrochemical stability at a high charging rate of 2 C over 100 cycles (96.0% of capacity retention) in comparison to traditional graphite&#8208;anode&#8208;based cells (86.1% of capacity retention). This work presents a new strategy for fast&#8208;charging lithium&#8208;ion batteries on the basis of high&#8208;speed solid&#8208;state lithium transport in intermetallic alloy hosts.

         <title>Development of Pure Green Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Material by Cyano Substitution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bathochromic shift of a multiple&#8208;resonance&#8208;induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence material (&#957;&#8208;DABNA) is achieved by introducing cyano groups. The cyano&#8208;substituted material (&#957;&#8208;DABNA&#8208;CN&#8208;Me) exhibits pure green emission with a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum. The fabricated organic light&#8208;emitting diode device exhibits a high maximum external quantum efficiency (31.9%), which is maintained (28.5%) at 1000 cd m&#8722;2, demonstrating a minimum efficiency roll&#8208;off.








Abstract
Multiple resonance (MR)&#8208;effect&#8208;induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials have garnered significant attention because they can achieve both high color purity and high external quantum efficiency (EQE). However, the reported green&#8208;emitting MR&#8208;TADF materials exhibit broader emission compared to those of blue&#8208;emitting ones and suffer from severe efficiency roll&#8208;off due to insufficient rate constants of reverse intersystem crossing process (kRISC). Herein, a pure green MR&#8208;TADF material (&#957;&#8208;DABNA&#8208;CN&#8208;Me) with high kRISC of 105 s&#8722;1 is reported. The key to success is introduction of cyano groups into a blue&#8208;emitting MR&#8208;TADF material (&#957;&#8208;DABNA), which causes remarkable bathochromic shift without a loss of color purity. The organic light&#8208;emitting diode employing it as an emitter exhibits green emission at 504&#160;nm with a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 23&#160;nm, corresponding to Commission Internationale d'&#201;clairage coordinates of (0.13, 0.65). The device achieves a high maximum EQE of 31.9% and successfully suppresses the efficiency roll&#8208;off at a high luminance.

The fabricated organic light-emitting diode device exhibits a high maximum external quantum efficiency (31.9%), which is maintained (28.5%) at 1000 cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, demonstrating a minimum efficiency roll-off.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple resonance (MR)-effect-induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials have garnered significant attention because they can achieve both high color purity and high external quantum efficiency (EQE). However, the reported green-emitting MR-TADF materials exhibit broader emission compared to those of blue-emitting ones and suffer from severe efficiency roll-off due to insufficient rate constants of reverse intersystem crossing process (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;RISC&lt;/sub&gt;). Herein, a pure green MR-TADF material (&lt;b&gt;&#957;-DABNA-CN-Me&lt;/b&gt;) with high &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;RISC&lt;/sub&gt; of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; is reported. The key to success is introduction of cyano groups into a blue-emitting MR-TADF material (&lt;b&gt;&#957;-DABNA&lt;/b&gt;), which causes remarkable bathochromic shift without a loss of color purity. The organic light-emitting diode employing it as an emitter exhibits green emission at 504&#160;nm with a small full-width at half-maximum of 23&#160;nm, corresponding to Commission Internationale d'&#201;clairage coordinates of (0.13, 0.65). The device achieves a high maximum EQE of 31.9% and successfully suppresses the efficiency roll-off at a high luminance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Based Printing of Leachable Salt Molds for Facile Shaping of Complex Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dissolvable salt&#8208;printed templates allow shaping of hard&#8208;to&#8208;print materials. The control of photoadditive and diluent concentrations in the salt&#8208;based ink is essential to achieve high&#8208;resolution printing of crack&#8208;free objects. Optimal ink formulations enable shaping of materials for various applications from lightweight construction to 3D cell cultures.








Abstract
3D printing is a powerful manufacturing technology for shaping materials into complex structures. While the palette of printable materials continues to expand, the rheological and chemical requisites for printing are not always easy to fulfill. Here, a universal manufacturing platform is reported for shaping materials into intricate geometries without the need for their printability, but instead using light&#8208;based printed salt structures as leachable molds. The salt structures are printed using photocurable resins loaded with NaCl particles. The printing, debinding, and sintering steps involved in the process are systematically investigated to identify ink formulations enabling the preparation of crack&#8208;free salt templates. The experiments reveal that the formation of a load&#8208;bearing network of salt particles is essential to prevent cracking of the mold during the process. By infiltrating the sintered salt molds and leaching the template in water, complex&#8208;shaped architectures are created from diverse compositions such as biomedical silicone, chocolate, light metals, degradable elastomers, and fiber composites, thus demonstrating the universal, cost&#8208;effective, and sustainable nature of this new manufacturing platform.

         <title>Efficient Photon Extraction in Top&#8208;Emission Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Devices Based on Ampicillin Microstructures</title>

         <dc:description>
The desire to enhance the efficiency of organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs) has driven to the investigation of advanced materials with fascinating properties. In ths work, 63.4% external quantum efficiency is achieved with ampicillin (antibiotic)&#8208;based top&#8208;emission OLEDs by introducing ampicillin microstructures (Amp&#8208;MSs) with dual phases (&#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;phase) that induce photoluminescence, electroluminescence, and scattering effect, simultaneously.








Abstract
The desire to enhance the efficiency of organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs) has driven to the investigation of advanced materials with fascinating properties. In this work, the efficiency of top&#8208;emission OLEDs (TEOLEDs) is enhanced by introducing ampicillin microstructures (Amp&#8208;MSs) with dual phases (&#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;phase) that induce photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL). Moreover, Amp&#8208;MSs can adjust the charge balance by Fermi level (EF) alignment, thereby decreasing the leakage current. The decrease in the wave&#8208;guided modes can enhance the light outcoupling through optical scattering. The resulting TEOLED demonstrates a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency (EQE) (maximum: 68.7% and average: 63.4% at spectroradiometer; maximum: 44.8% and average: 42.6% at integrating sphere) with a wider color gamut (118%) owing to the redshift of the spectrum by J&#8208;aggregation. Deconvolution of the EL intensities is performed to clarify the contribution of Amp&#8208;MSs to the device EQE enhancement (optical scattering by Amp&#8208;MSs: 17.0%, PL by radiative energy transfer: 9.1%, and EL by J&#8208;aggregated excitons: 4.6%). The proposed TEOLED outperforms the existing frameworks in terms of device efficiency.

         <title>Concentrated Electrolytes Enabling Stable Aqueous Ammonium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solvation structure, electrochemical properties, and electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphase of a novel concentrated (5.8 m) aqueous (NH4)2SO4 electrolyte are unveiled by the combination of theoretical and experimental methods. The unique solvation structure of the concentrated electrolyte and the formed surface layer guarantee the full cell with a capacity retention of &#8776;72% and a coulombic efficiency of 99.2% after 1000 cycles.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous batteries are promising devices for large&#8208;scale energy&#8208;storage applications because of their low&#8208;cost, inherent safety, and environmental friendliness. Among them, aqueous ammonium&#8208;ion (NH4+) batteries (AAIB) are currently emerging owing to the fast diffusion kinetics of NH4+. Nevertheless, it is still a challenge to obtain stable AAIB with relatively high output potential, considering the instability of many electrode materials in an aqueous environment. Herein, a cell based on a concentrated (5.8 m) aqueous (NH4)2SO4 electrolyte, ammonium copper hexacyanoferrate (N&#8208;CuHCF) as the positive electrode (cathode), and 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylene&#8208;bis(dicarboximide) (PTCDI) as the negative electrode (anode) is reported. The solvation structure, electrochemical properties, as well as the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface and interphase are systematically investigated by the combination of theoretical and experimental methods. The results indicate a remarkable cycling performance of the low&#8208;cost rocking&#8208;chair AAIB, which offers a capacity retention of &#8776;72% after 1000 cycles and an average output potential of &#8776;1.0&#160;V.

         <title>Tensile&#8208;Strained Palladium Nanosheets for Synthetic Catalytic Therapy and Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface reconstruction strategy is reported for the fabrication of lattice&#8208;tensile&#8208;strained Pd nanosheets with photodynamic, catalase&#8208;, and peroxidase&#8208;like properties. The in vivo tumor inhibition rate in a 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice model of the strained Pd nanosheets is approximately five times higher than that of the pristine Pd nanosheets.








Abstract
Palladium nanosheets (Pd NSs) are well&#8208;investigated photothermal therapy agents, but their catalytic potential for tumor therapy has been underexplored owing to the inactive dominant (111) facets. Herein, lattice tensile strain is introduced by surface reconstruction to activate the inert surface, endowing the strained Pd NSs (SPd NSs) with photodynamic, catalase&#8208;like, and peroxidase&#8208;like properties. Tensile strain promoting the photodynamic and enzyme&#8208;like activities is revealed by density functional theory calculations. Compared with Pd NSs, SPd NSs exhibit lower photothermal effect, but approximately five times higher tumor inhibition rate. This work calls for further study to activate nanomaterials by strain engineering and surface reconstruction for catalytic therapy of tumors.

         <title>Ultrahigh Carrier Mobilities in Ferroelectric Domain Wall Corbino Cones at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetoresistance is measured in conical 180&#176; charged domain walls, in ferroelectric lithium niobate. Extracted carrier mobilities are extremely high, up to &#8776;3700 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. This is an unparalleled value for oxide interfaces (and for bulk oxides too) and is most comparable to mobilities in other systems typically seen at cryogenic, rather than at room, temperature.








Abstract
Recently, electrically conducting heterointerfaces between dissimilar band insulators (such as lanthanum aluminate and strontium titanate) have attracted considerable research interest. Charge transport and fundamental aspects of conduction have been thoroughly explored. Perhaps surprisingly, similar studies on conceptually much simpler conducting homointerfaces, such as domain walls, are not nearly so well developed. Addressing this disparity, magnetoresistance is herein reported in approximately conical 180&#176; charged domain walls, in partially switched ferroelectric thin&#8208;film single&#8208;crystal lithium niobate. This system is ideal for such measurements: first, the conductivity difference between domains and domain walls is unusually large (a factor of 1013) and hence currents driven through the thin film, between planar top and bottom electrodes, are overwhelmingly channeled along the walls; second, when electrical contact is made to the top and bottom of the domain walls and a magnetic field is applied along their cone axes, then the test geometry mirrors that of a Corbino disk: a textbook arrangement for geometric magnetoresistance measurement. Data imply carriers with extremely high room&#8208;temperature Hall mobilities of up to &#8776;3700 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. This is an unparalleled value for oxide interfaces (and for bulk oxides) comparable to mobilities in other systems seen at cryogenic, rather than at room, temperature.

         <title>Zwitterion&#8208;Functionalized SnO2 Substrate Induced Sequential Deposition of Black&#8208;Phase FAPbI3 with Rearranged PbI2 Residue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zwitterion formamidine sulfinic acid (FSA) is deposited at the tin(IV) oxide (SnO2)/perovskite interface to induce the crystallization of high&#8208;quality black&#8208;phase formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3), and also help reduce the side effect of the residual lead iodide (PbI2), yielding an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.1% and 1000 h long&#8208;term operational stability.








Abstract
Black&#8208;phase formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) with narrow bandgap and high thermal stability has emerged as the most promising candidate for highly efficient and stable perovskite photovoltaics. In order to overcome the intrinsic difficulty of black&#8208;phase crystallization and to eliminate the lead iodide (PbI2) residue, most sequential deposition methods of FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskite will introduce external ions like methylammonium (MA+), cesium (Cs+), and bromide (Br&#8211;) ions to the perovskite structure. Here a zwitterion&#8208;functionalized tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) is introduced as the electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL) to induce the crystallization of high&#8208;quality black&#8208;phase FAPbI3. The SnO2 ETL treated with the zwitterion of formamidine sulfinic acid (FSA) can help rearrange the stack direction, orientation, and distribution of residual PbI2 in the perovskite layer, which reduces the side effect of the residual PbI2. Besides, the FSA functionalization also modifies SnO2 ETL to suppress deep&#8208;level defects at the perovskite/SnO2 interface. As a result, the FSA&#8211;FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exhibit an excellent power conversion efficiency of up to 24.1% with 1000 h long&#8208;term operational stability. These findings provide a new interface engineering strategy on the sequential fabrication of black&#8208;phase FAPbI3 PSCs with improved optoelectronic performance.

         <title>Stretchable and Biodegradable Batteries with High Energy and Power Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kirigami&#8208;patterned biodegradable metal electrodes are introduced to achieve biodegradable stretchable batteries with high power and energy density. The elastic electrodes exhibit excellent electrical performance under deformation. Combining molybdenum trioxide with magnesium yields stretchable cells with energy densities as high as 1.72 mWh cm&#8211;2. The batteries can power a wearable biosensing patch, enabling on&#8208;skin monitoring of physiological signals.








Abstract
Realizing a sustainable, technologically advanced future will necessitate solving the electronic waste problem. Biodegradable forms of electronics offer a viable path through their environmental benignity. With both the sheer number of devices produced every day as well as their areas of application ever increasing, new concepts of degradable batteries able to sustain the high power demands of modern electronics must be developed. Simultaneously, integration of electronics in close interaction with its user or powering soft robotic devices necessitates high degrees of compliance, rendering stretchable batteries indispensable. Here, a concept for merging intrinsically stretchable materials with engineered stretchability by kirigami&#8208;patterning on a component level is shown to yield high&#8208;power biodegradable batteries with reversible elasticity up to 35% when stretched uniaxially and 20% for biaxial extension. Using a combination of molybdenum metal foils, a molybdenum trioxide paste, and magnesium metal foils as electrode materials, a peak power output of 196 &#181;W cm&#8211;2 and an energy density of 1.72 mWh cm&#8211;2 is achieved. The biodegradable batteries are used to power an on&#8208;skin biomedical sensor patch, enabling monitoring of sodium concentration in sweat. This concept provides a versatile route for high&#8208;power biodegradable batteries, enabling untethered soft electronic devices in a sustainable future.

         <title>Using Machine Learning to Predict and Understand Complex Self&#8208;Assembly Behaviors of a Multicomponent Nanocomposite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phase behavior of multicomponent nanocomposites is complex and cannot be predicted by theory alone. Machine learning (ML) methods are a compelling alternative to experimental trial and error. In this work, 595 microscopy images of nanocomposites are used to train a series of ML models. The predictions provide insights into the system and suggest ML can significantly streamline the design of nanocomposites.








Abstract
Blends of nanoparticles, polymers, and small molecules can self&#8208;assemble into optical, magnetic, and electronic devices with structure&#8208;dependent properties. However, the relationship between a multicomponent nanocomposite's formulation and its assembled structure is complex and cannot be predicted by theory. The blends can be strongly influenced by processing conditions, which can introduce non&#8208;equilibrium states. Currently, nanocomposite devices are designed through cycles of experimental trial and error. Machine learning (ML) methods are a compelling alternative because they can use existing datasets to map high&#8208;dimensional spaces. These methods do not rely on known relationships between parameters, so they are suited to complex systems without a solid theoretical foundation. Here, a dataset of 595 microscopy images of nanocomposite thin films is used to train a series of ML models. Correlations between the input and output parameters are examined, providing new insights into the system. Finally, the most successful ML model is used to predict the structures of new nanocomposite compositions. The results confirm that ML techniques can be used to improve the efficiency of nanocomposite device design. More broadly, the current study suggests some of the advantages and challenges associated with applying ML to complex systems.

         <title>Conformation Dynamics of Single Polymer Strands in Solution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene liquid cell transmission electron microscopy visualizes the chain&#8208;resolved conformational dynamics of a single dendronized polymer diffusing in confined organic solvent. Direct observations show the equilibrium and non&#8208;equilibrium chain&#8208;dynamics of semiflexible polymers. The solvated semiflexible chain fluctuates between coiled and stretched conformations. Non&#8208;equilibrium chain motions including drag and cleavage, due to the interfacial interaction, are also observed.








Abstract
Conformational changes in macromolecules significantly affect their functions and assembly into high&#8208;level structures. Despite advances in theoretical and experimental studies, investigations into the intrinsic conformational variations and dynamic motions of single macromolecules remain challenging. Here, liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy enables the real&#8208;time tracking of single&#8208;chain polymers. Imaging linear polymers, synthetically dendronized with conjugated aromatic groups, in organic solvent confined within graphene liquid cells, directly exhibits chain&#8208;resolved conformational dynamics of individual semiflexible polymers. These experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the dynamic conformational transitions of the single&#8208;chain polymer originate from the degree of intrachain interactions. In situ observations also show that such dynamics of the single&#8208;chain polymer are significantly affected by environmental factors, including surfaces and interfaces.

         <title>Thermal Shock Fabrication of Ion&#8208;Stabilized Perovskite and Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A highly crystalline tempered&#8208;glass&#8208;like perovskite with compressed surface lattice&#8208;structure can be made by a thermal&#8208;shocking fabrication process, which significantly enhances the ionic activation temperature and contributes to hysteresis&#8208;free operation of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) at high temperature up to 363 K, enabling efficient and stable PSCs fabricated by a high&#8208;speed post&#8208;annealing&#8208;free process in air with the scalable bar&#8208;coating technique.








Abstract
A highly crystalline tempered&#8208;glass&#8208;like perovskite grain structure with compressed surface lattice realized by a thermal&#8208;shocking fabrication is shown. The strained perovskite grain structure is stabilized by Cl&#8722;&#8208;reinforcing surface lattice and shows enhanced bonding energy and ionic activation temperature, which contributes to hysteresis&#8208;free operation of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) at much higher temperature up to 363 K in thermal&#8208;shocking&#8208;processed MAPbClxI3&#8722;x (T&#8208;MPI). The PSCs can be fabricated by a high&#8208;speed fully air process without post&#8208;annealing based on the scalable bar&#8208;coating technique. Both high efficiency and stability are achieved in T&#8208;MPI PSC with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 22.99% and long&#8208;term operational stability with T80 lifetime exceeding 4000 h.

         <title>Composition Engineering of Amorphous Nickel Boride Nanoarchitectures Enabling Highly Efficient Electrosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of amorphous nickel borides electrocatalysts is developed for the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR), out of which, NiB2 demonstrates remarkable activity, selectivity, and stability. Furthermore, the dependence of 2e&#8722; ORR performance of amorphous nickel borides by tuning the atomic ratio of Ni and B is uncovered from the perspective of free&#8208;adsorption energy and dynamic charge transfer kinetics.








Abstract
Developing advanced electrocatalysts with exceptional two electron (2e&#8722;) selectivity, activity, and stability is crucial for driving the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Herein, a composition engineering strategy is proposed to flexibly regulate the intrinsic activity of amorphous nickel boride nanoarchitectures for efficient 2e&#8722; ORR by oriented reduction of Ni2+ with different amounts of BH4&#8722;. Among borides, the amorphous NiB2 delivers the 2e&#8722; selectivity close to 99% at 0.4&#160;V and over 93% in a wide potential range, together with a negligible activity decay under prolonged time. Notably, an ultrahigh H2O2 production rate of 4.753&#160;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 is achieved upon assembling NiB2 in the practical gas diffusion electrode. The combination of X&#8208;ray absorption and in situ Raman spectroscopy, as well as transient photovoltage measurements with density functional theory, unequivocally reveal that the atomic ratio between Ni and B induces the local electronic structure diversity, allowing optimization of the adsorption energy of Ni toward *OOH and reducing of the interfacial charge&#8208;transfer kinetics to preserve the O&#63743;O bond.

         <title>Drug in Drug: A Host&#8211;Guest Formulation of Azocalixarene with Hydroxychloroquine for Synergistic Anti&#8208;Inflammation</title>

Macrocyclic delivery and therapeutics are two hotspots in supramolecular biomedicine that have only been occasionally merged. In this work, a &#8220;drug&#8208;in&#8208;drug&#8221; strategy is proposed, in which an active drug is encapsulated by a therapeutically active macrocycle, forming a multifunctional supramolecular active ingredient. This drug&#8208;in&#8208;drug formulation achieves the advantages of macrocycles acting as both carriers and therapeutic agents to realize combinational therapy.








Abstract
Macrocyclic delivery and therapeutics are two significant topics in supramolecular biomedicine. The functional integration of these topics would open new avenues for treating diseases synergistically. However, these two individual topics have only been occasionally merged, probably because of the lack of functionalized design of macrocyclic host and the lack of efficient recognition between host and guest drugs. Herein, a &#8220;drug&#8208;in&#8208;drug&#8221; strategy is proposed, in which an active drug is encapsulated by a macrocycle possessing therapeutic activity to form a multifunctional supramolecular active pharmaceutical ingredient. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a complex of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) with sulfonated azocalix[4]arene (HCQ@SAC4A) is prepared to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a combined fashion. SAC4A is a therapeutic agent that exhibits scavenging capacity for reactive oxygen species and exerts an anti&#8208;inflammatory effect. It is also a hypoxia&#8208;responsive carrier that can deliver HCQ directly to the inflammatory articular cavity. Consequently, HCQ@SAC4A achieves the synergistic anti&#8208;inflammatory effect on both inflamed RAW 264.7 cells and RA rats. This effect is attributed to the temporal and spatial consistency of the two active ingredients of the complex. As a new paradigm for combinational therapy, the drug&#8208;in&#8208;drug strategy advances in easy preparation, mix&#8208;and&#8208;match combination, and precise ratiometric control.

         <title>A Personalized Electronic Tattoo for Healthcare Realized by On&#8208;the&#8208;Spot Assembly of an Intrinsically Conductive and Durable Liquid&#8208;Metal Composite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of e&#8208;tattoo that can be directly implemented on the skin by rapid one&#8208;step coating with various designs at a multi&#8208;scale for personalized healthcare is introduced. The e&#8208;tattoo is realized by tuning the electrically conductive and mechanically durable liquid metal composite based suspension to have low repulsion between particles, excellent wettability, and high vapor pressure.








Abstract
Conventional electronic (e&#8208;) skins are a class of thin&#8208;film electronics mainly fabricated in laboratories or factories, which is incapable of rapid and simple customization for personalized healthcare. Here a new class of e&#8208;tattoos is introduced that can be directly implemented on the skin by facile one&#8208;step coating with various designs at multi&#8208;scale depending on the purpose of the user without a substrate. An e&#8208;tattoo is realized by attaching Pt&#8208;decorated carbon nanotubes on gallium&#8208;based liquid&#8208;metal particles (CMP) to impose intrinsic electrical conductivity and mechanical durability. Tuning the CMP suspension to have low&#8208;zeta potential, excellent wettability, and high&#8208;vapor pressure enables conformal and intimate assembly of particles directly on the skin in 10 s. Low&#8208;cost, ease of preparation, on&#8208;skin compatibility, and multifunctionality of CMP make it highly suitable for e&#8208;tattoos. Demonstrations of electrical muscle stimulators, photothermal patches, motion artifact&#8208;free electrophysiological sensors, and electrochemical biosensors validate the simplicity, versatility, and reliability of the e&#8208;tattoo&#8208;based approach in biomedical engineering.

&lt;p&gt;A new class of e-tattoo that can be directly implemented on the skin by rapid one-step coating with various designs at a multi-scale for personalized healthcare is introduced. The e-tattoo is realized by tuning the electrically conductive and mechanically durable liquid metal composite based suspension to have low repulsion between particles, excellent wettability, and high vapor pressure.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional electronic (e-) skins are a class of thin-film electronics mainly fabricated in laboratories or factories, which is incapable of rapid and simple customization for personalized healthcare. Here a new class of e-tattoos is introduced that can be directly implemented on the skin by facile one-step coating with various designs at multi-scale depending on the purpose of the user without a substrate. An e-tattoo is realized by attaching Pt-decorated carbon nanotubes on gallium-based liquid-metal particles (CMP) to impose intrinsic electrical conductivity and mechanical durability. Tuning the CMP suspension to have low-zeta potential, excellent wettability, and high-vapor pressure enables conformal and intimate assembly of particles directly on the skin in 10 s. Low-cost, ease of preparation, on-skin compatibility, and multifunctionality of CMP make it highly suitable for e-tattoos. Demonstrations of electrical muscle stimulators, photothermal patches, motion artifact-free electrophysiological sensors, and electrochemical biosensors validate the simplicity, versatility, and reliability of the e-tattoo-based approach in biomedical engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrahigh Kinetic Inductance Superconducting Materials from Spinodal Decomposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;dissipative circuit element with considerably large inductance is indispensable for the noise&#8208;resilient superconducting qubits. Here, spinodal decomposition is utilized to achieve ultrahigh kinetic inductance in the superconducting materials. Model epitaxial Ti0.48Al0.52N thin films are used and a drastic enhancement in kinetic inductance by 2&#8211;3 orders of magnitude while maintaining a low microwave loss is demonstrated.








Abstract
Disordered superconducting nitrides with kinetic inductance have long been considered to be leading material candidates for high&#8208;inductance quantum&#8208;circuit applications. Despite continuing efforts toward reducing material dimensions to increase the kinetic inductance and the corresponding circuit impedance, achieving further improvements without compromising material quality has become a fundamental challenge. To this end, a method to drastically increase the kinetic inductance of superconducting materials via spinodal decomposition while maintaining a low microwave loss is proposed. Epitaxial Ti0.48Al0.52N is used as a model system and the utilization of spinodal decomposition to trigger the insulator&#8208;to&#8208;superconductor transition with a drastically enhanced material disorder is demonstrated. The measured kinetic inductance increases by two to three orders of magnitude compared with the best disordered superconducting nitrides reported to date. This work paves the way for substantially enhancing and deterministically controlling the inductance for advanced superconducting quantum&#160;circuits.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries: Rules for Catalyst Selection and Electrode Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systematically theoretical calculations are performed to seek the optimal catalyst from transition metal nitrides for room&#8208;temperature advanced Na&#8211;S batteries. Based on theoretical results, a dual&#8208;functioning host (MoN@CNFs) is designed and synthesized for S and Na electrodes, which exhibits superior electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Seeking an optimal catalyst to accelerate conversion reaction kinetics of room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT Na&#8211;S) batteries is crucial for improving their electrochemical performance and promoting the practical applications. Herein, theoretical calculations of interfacial interactions of catalysts and polysulfides in terms of the surface adsorption state, interfacial ions migration, and electronic concentration around the Fermi level are systematically proposed as guiding principles of catalyst selection for RT Na&#8211;S batteries. As a case, MoN catalyst is accurately selected from transition metal nitrides with different d orbital electrons, and for experiment, it is introduced into the carbon nanofibers as a dual&#8208;functioning host (MoN@CNFs). The MoN@CNFs can effectively anchor polysulfides and accelerate their conversion reaction. In addition, for the sodium anode, the MoN@CNFs can also induce uniform deposition of Na and inhibit dendrite growth, which are supported by in situ characterizations and finite element simulation technique. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared RT Na&#8211;S battery displays high reversible capacity of 990 mAh g&#8211;1 at 0.2 A g&#8211;1 after 100 cycles and long lifespan over 1500 cycles at 2 A g&#8211;1. Even with high S loading of 5&#160;mg cm&#8211;2, the RT Na&#8211;S battery still exhibits a high areal capacity of 2.5 mAh cm&#8211;2.

         <title>Fluorinated Perylene&#8208;Diimides: Cathode Interlayers Facilitating Carrier Collection for High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have experienced rapid progress with the innovation of near&#8208;infrared&#8208;absorbing small&#8208;molecular acceptors. This work prescribes a facile, cost&#8208;effective, and scalable method for the preparation of high&#8208;performance fluorinated perylene&#8208;diimide as cathode interlayers, making OSCs more promising.








Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have experienced rapid progress with the innovation of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;absorbing small&#8208;molecular acceptors (SMAs), while the unique electronic properties of the SMAs raise new challenges in relation to cathode engineering for effective electron collection. To address this issue, two fluorinated perylene&#8208;diimides (PDIs), PDINN&#8208;F and PDINN&#8208;2F, are synthesized by a simple fluorination method, for application as cathode interlayer (CIL) materials. The two bay&#8208;fluorinated PDI&#8208;based CILs possess a lower lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of &#8776;&#8722;4.0&#160;eV, which improves the energy level alignment at the NIR&#8208;SMAs (such as BTP&#8208;eC9)/CIL for a favorable electron extraction efficiency. The monofluorinated PDINN&#8208;F shows higher electron mobility and better improved interfacial compatibility. The PDINN&#8208;F&#8208;based OSCs with PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 as active layer exhibit an enhanced fill factor and larger short&#8208;circuit current density, leading to a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 18%. The devices with PDINN&#8208;F CIL retain more than 80% of their initial PCE after operating at the maximum power point under continuous illumination for 750 h. This work prescribes a facile, cost&#8208;effective, and scalable method for the preparation of stable, high&#8208;performance fluorinated CILs, and instilling promise for the NIR&#8208;SMAs&#8208;based OSCs moving forward.

Archer and co-workers describe how polymerization of 1,3-dioxolane, containing hairy nanoparticles of poly(ethylene glycol) chains densely grafted to SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanocores, inside an electrochemical cell, creates hybrid solid-state electrolytes that offer enhanced wettability and additional degrees of freedom for regulating ionic transport pathways in the bulk and at interfaces in solid-state battery cells.

         <title>Gas Separations using Nanoporous Atomically Thin Membranes: Recent Theoretical, Simulation, and Experimental Advances</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent development of novel atomically thin 2D materials, including graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenides, offers great opportunities for potential breakthroughs in the membrane separation field. Recent research advances, challenges, and potential future directions in the application of nanoporous atomically thin membranes for gas separation are summarized.








Abstract
Porous graphene and other atomically thin 2D materials are regarded as highly promising membrane materials for high&#8208;performance gas separations due to their atomic thickness, large&#8208;scale synthesizability, excellent mechanical strength, and chemical stability. When these atomically thin materials contain a high areal density of gas&#8208;sieving nanoscale pores, they can exhibit both high gas permeances and high selectivities, which is beneficial for reducing the cost of gas&#8208;separation processes. Here, recent modeling and experimental advances in nanoporous atomically thin membranes for gas separations is discussed. The major challenges involved, including controlling pore size distributions, scaling up the membrane area, and matching theory with experimental results, are also highlighted. Finally, important future directions are proposed for real gas&#8208;separation applications of nanoporous atomically thin membranes.

Quantum conductance effects in memristive devices are reviewed, from fundamentals of electrochemical phenomena underlying memristive functionalities to ballistic electronic conduction transport in atomic&#8208;sized conductive filaments. Related challenges in nanoscale metrology for the characterization of memristive phenomena at the nanoscale are analyzed together with opportunities and envisioned applications for memristive devices working in the quantum regime.








Abstract
Quantum effects in novel functional materials and new device concepts represent a potential breakthrough for the development of new information processing technologies based on quantum phenomena. Among the emerging technologies, memristive elements that exhibit resistive switching, which relies on the electrochemical formation/rupture of conductive nanofilaments, exhibit quantum conductance effects at room temperature. Despite the underlying resistive switching mechanism having been exploited for the realization of next&#8208;generation memories and neuromorphic computing architectures, the potentialities of quantum effects in memristive devices are still rather unexplored. Here, a comprehensive review on memristive quantum devices, where quantum conductance effects can be observed by coupling ionics with electronics, is presented. Fundamental electrochemical and physicochemical phenomena underlying device functionalities are introduced, together with fundamentals of electronic ballistic conduction transport in nanofilaments. Quantum conductance effects including quantum mode splitting, stability, and random telegraph noise are analyzed, reporting experimental techniques and challenges of nanoscale metrology for the characterization of memristive phenomena. Finally, potential applications and future perspectives are envisioned, discussing how memristive devices with controllable atomic&#8208;sized conductive filaments can represent not only suitable platforms for the investigation of quantum phenomena but also promising building blocks for the realization of integrated quantum systems working in air at room temperature.

Biophysical signals, especially mechanical cues, are crucial in many (patho)physiological processes. An overview of the current state of the art in the design and development of materials and devices that can deliver mechanical stimulation to cells and tissues, with a focus on their design principles, is provided, and challenges and perspectives for future research directions are highlighted.








Abstract
Biochemical signals, such as growth factors, cytokines, and transcription factors are known to play a crucial role in regulating a variety of cellular activities as well as maintaining the normal function of different tissues and organs. If the biochemical signals are assumed to be one side of the coin, the other side comprises biophysical cues. There is growing evidence showing that biophysical signals, and in particular mechanical cues, also play an important role in different stages of human life ranging from morphogenesis during embryonic development to maturation and maintenance of tissue and organ function throughout life. In order to investigate how mechanical signals influence cell and tissue function, tremendous efforts have been devoted to fabricating various materials and devices for delivering mechanical stimuli to cells and tissues. Here, an overview of the current state of the art in the design and development of such materials and devices is provided, with a focus on their design principles, and challenges and perspectives for future research directions are highlighted.

         <title>Semiconducting Polymer Nanoparticles with Surface&#8208;Mimicking Protein Secondary Structure as Lysosome&#8208;Targeting Chimaeras for Self&#8208;Synergistic Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new kind of photodynamic semiconducting polymer nanoparticles with surface mimicking protein secondary structure (SPSS NPs) is developed to achieve self&#8208;synergistic cancer immunotherapy by combining excellent immunogenic cell death and lysosome&#8208;targeting chimaera&#8208;like multivalent programmed cell death ligand&#8208;1&#160;blockade. SPSS NPs can not only effectively suppress both primary tumor and distant tumor, but also evoke long&#8208;term immunological memory against tumor rechallenge.








Abstract
Immunotherapy has received tremendous attention for tumor treatment, but the efficacy is greatly hindered by insufficient tumor&#8208;infiltration of immune cells and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The strategy that can efficiently activate cytotoxic T lymphocytes and inhibit negative immune regulators will greatly amplify immunotherapy outcome, which is however very rare. Herein, a new kind of semiconducting polymer (SP) nanoparticles is developed, featured with surface&#8208;mimicking protein secondary structure (SPSS NPs) for self&#8208;synergistic cancer immunotherapy by combining immunogenic cell death (ICD) and immune checkpoint blockade therapy. The SPs with excellent photodynamic property are synthesized by rational fluorination, which can massively induce ICD. Additionally, the peptide antagonists are introduced and self&#8208;assembled into &#946;&#8208;sheet protein secondary structures on the photodynamic NP surface via preparation process optimization, which function as efficient lysosome&#8208;targeting chimaeras (LYTACs) to mediate the degradation of programmed cell death ligand&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;L1)&#160;in lysosome. In vivo experiments demonstrate that SPSS NPs can not only elicit strong antitumor immunity to suppress both primary tumor and distant tumor, but also evoke long&#8208;term immunological memory against tumor rechallenge. This work introduces a new kind of robust immunotherapy agents by combining well&#8208;designed photosensitizer&#8208;based ICD induction and protein secondary structures&#8208;mediated LYTAC&#8208;like multivalence PD&#8208;L1&#160;blockade, rendering great promise for synergistic immunotherapy.

         <title>Nonhalogenated Dual&#8208;Slot&#8208;Die Processing Enables High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and effective strategy of dual&#8208;slot&#8208;die sequential processing (DSDS)&#160;is developed. Highly efficient nonhalogenated organic solar cells are fabricated by slot&#8208;die coating by the DSDS strategy without additives and complex post&#8208;treatments.








Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation photovoltaic technologies, with their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) reaching 19%. However, the typically used spin&#8208;coating method, toxic halogenated processing solvents, and the conventional bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ), which causes excessive charge recombination, hamper the commercialization and further efficiency promotion of OSCs. Here, a simple but effective dual&#8208;slot&#8208;die sequential processing (DSDS) strategy is proposed to address the above issues by achieving a continuous solution supply, avoiding the solubility limit of the nonhalogen solvents, and creating a graded&#8208;BHJ morphology. As a result, an excellent PCE of 17.07% is obtained with the device processed with o&#8208;xylene in an open&#8208;air environment with no post&#8208;treatment required, while a PCE of over 14% is preserved in a wide range of active&#8208;layer thickness. The unique film&#8208;formation mechanism is further identified during the DSDS processing, which suggests the formation of the graded&#8208;BHJ morphology by the mutual diffusion between the donor and acceptor and the subsequent progressive aggregation. The graded&#8208;BHJ structure leads to improved charge transport, inhibited charge recombination, and thus an excellent PCE. Therefore, the newly developed DSDS approach can effectively contribute to the realm of high&#8208;efficiency and eco&#8208;friendly OSCs, which can also possibly be generalized to other organic photoelectric devices.

         <title>A Euryhaline&#8208;Fish&#8208;Inspired Salinity Self&#8208;Adaptive Nanofluidic Diode Leads to High&#8208;Performance Blue Energy Harvesters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sandwich&#8208;structured nanochannel system is constructed to realize salinity self&#8208;adaptive nanofluidic diodes, which lead to a high&#8208;performance salinity&#8208;gradient power generator with low internal resistance. Adaptive to changing salinity, the pore morphology of one side of the nanochannel system switches from a 1D straight nanochannel to 3D network pores, along with three orders of magnitude change for charge density.








Abstract
The adaptability to wide salinities remains a big challenge for artificial nanofluidic systems, which plays a vital role in water&#8211;energy nexus science. Here, inspired by euryhaline fish, sandwich&#8208;structured nanochannel systems are constructed to realize salinity self&#8208;adaptive nanofluidic diodes, which lead to high&#8208;performance salinity&#8208;gradient power generators with low internal resistance. Adaptive to changing salinity, the pore morphology of one side of the nanochannel system switches from a 1D straight nanochannel&#160;(45 nm) to 3D network pores (1.9 nm pore size and &#8776;1013 pore density), along with three orders of magnitude change for charge density. Thus, the abundant surface charges and narrow pores render the membrane&#8208;based osmotic power generator with power density up to 26.22 Wm&#8722;2. The salinity&#8208;adaptive membrane solves the surface charge&#8208;shielding problem caused by abundant mobile ions in high salinity and increases the overlapping degree of the electric double layer. The dynamic adaption process of the membrane to the hypersaline environment endows it with good salt endurance and stability. New routes for designing nanofluidic devices functionally adaptable to different salinities and building power generators with excellent salt endurance are demonstrated.

         <title>Accessing Excitation&#8208; and Time&#8208;Responsive Afterglows from Aqueous Processable Amorphous Polymer Films through Doping and Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart luminescent materials with tunable multicolor afterglows in response to excitation and delay time can be facilely constructed with aqueous processable polymers through physical doping. The afterglow colors can further be finely modulated by the variation of the doping concentration, co&#8208;doping, and the triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet F&#246;rster resonance energy&#8208;transfer process.








Abstract
Smart afterglow materials in response to excitation and delay time, including crystals, polymeric films, and carbon dots, have attracted considerable attention on account of their fundamental value in photophysics and promising applications in optoelectronics. However, the fabrication of amorphous and flexible polymer films with fine control remains underexplored. Herein, new doped polymer films based on sodium alginate and aromatic carboxylates are developed, which demonstrate following advantages: (i) easy and fast fabrication through the aqueous solution process, (ii) flexible, transparent, and re&#8208;dissolvable characteristics, (iii) multi&#8208;tunable afterglow colors from blue to red and even white with fine control. Specifically, even better controllability can be achieved through co&#8208;doping and triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (TS&#8208;FRET). Multimode advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting of these materials is demonstrated using their excitation&#8208; and time&#8208;dependent as well as TS&#8208;FRET&#8208;mediated afterglow colors.

         <title>A Skin&#8208;Inspired Design Integrating Mechano&#8211;Chemical&#8211;Thermal Robustness into Superhydrophobic Coatings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A skin&#8208;inspired triple&#8208;layered coating (STC) concept is proposed. The STC solves the contradiction between the superhydrophobicity and other functionalities (such as abrasion resistance, adhesion, and flame retardancy). Based on a step&#8208;by&#8208;step spraying process and feasible control of the components of each layer, continuous interfaces within layers are achieved, endowing the integration of excellent overall performances into one coating.








Abstract
Designing scalable coatings with a wide spectrum of functions such as liquid repellency, anticorrosion, and antiflaming and a high level of mechano&#8211;chemical&#8211;thermal robustness is crucial in real&#8208;life applications. However, these individual functionalities and robustness are coupled together or even have conflicting requirements on the interfacial or bulky properties of materials, and&#160;thus,&#160;simultaneously integrating all these individual features into one coating has proved challenging. Herein, an integral skin&#8208;inspired triple&#8208;layered coating (STC) that resolves conflicting demands imposed by individual features on the structural, chemical, mechanical, and thermal properties of materials is proposed. Specifically, the rational design of multiple gradients in roughness, wetting, strength, and flame retardancy and the formation of continuous interfaces along its triple layers endow a sustained liquid repellency, anticorrosion, and flame retardancy even under harsh environments, as well as strong antiabrasion on surfaces and adhesion with the substrate. Such an all&#8208;in&#8208;one design enhances the durability and lifetime of coatings and reduces the maintenance and repair, thereby contributing to cost and energy saving. Together with a facile spraying fabrication process, this STC provides a feasible and sustainable strategy for constructing energy and resource&#8208;saving materials.

         <title>Sugar&#8208;Derived Isotropic Nanoscale Polycrystalline Graphite Capable of Considerable Plastic Deformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sugar&#8208;derived isotropic nanoscale polycrystalline graphite (SINPG) is prepared from colloidal organization of nanocapsules to nanograins by gel&#8208;casting in a non&#8208;pressure environment. SINPG exhibits ultrahigh strength, unprecedent plasticity, and excellent deformation, acting as a metallic material in compression tests. The cleavage associated with typical van der Waals materials is avoided with SINPG.








Abstract
Obtaining large plastic deformation in polycrystalline van der Waals (vdW) materials is challenging. Achieving such deformation is especially difficult in graphite because it is highly anisotropic. The development of sugar&#8208;derived isotropic nanostructured polycrystalline graphite (SINPG) is discussed herein. The structure of this material preserves the high in&#8208;plane rigidity and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane flexibility of graphene layers and enables prominent plasticity by activating the rotation of nanoscale (5&#8211;10&#160;nm) grains. Thus, micrometer&#8208;sized SINPG samples demonstrate enhanced compressive strengths of up to 3.0&#160;GPa and plastic strains of 30&#8211;50%. These findings suggest a new pathway for enabling plastic deformation in otherwise brittle vdW materials. This new class of nanostructured carbon materials is suitable for use in a broad range of fields, from semiconductor to aerospace applications.

         <title>Intracellular Crowding by Bio&#8208;Orthogonal Hydrogel Formation Induces Reversible Molecular Stasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intracellular crosslinking in living cells using poly(ethylene glycol) macromers is introduced. Increased macromolecular crowding in the cytosol of the cell causes crosslink&#8208;induced quiescence and results in reduced protein translation, cellular motility, and actin dynamics while cell viability remains high. The effects can be reversed through polymer degradation with UV light.








Abstract
To survive extreme conditions, certain animals enter a reversible protective stasis through vitrification of the cytosol by polymeric molecules such as proteins and polysaccharides. In this work, synthetic gelation of the cytosol in living cells is used to induce reversible molecular stasis. Through the sequential lipofectamine&#8208;mediated transfection of complementary poly(ethylene glycol) macromers into mammalian cells, intracellular crosslinking occurs through bio&#8208;orthogonal strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition click reactions. This achieves efficient polymer uptake with minimal cell death (99% viable). Intracellular crosslinking decreases DNA replication and protein synthesis, and increases the quiescent population by 2.5&#8208;fold. Real&#8208;time tracking of single cells containing intracellular crosslinked polymers identifies increases in intermitotic time (15 h&#160;vs 19 h) and decreases in motility (30 &#181;m h&#8722;1&#160;vs 15&#160;&#181;m h&#8722;1). The cytosol viscosity increases threefold after intracellular crosslinking and results in disordered cytoskeletal structure in addition to the disruption of cellular coordination in a scratch assay. By incorporating photodegradable nitrobenzyl moieties into the polymer backbone, the effects of intracellular crosslinking are reversed upon exposure to light, thereby restoring proliferation (80% phospho&#8208;Rb+ cells), protein translation, and migration. Reversible intracellular crosslinking provides a novel method for dynamic manipulation of intracellular mechanics, altering essential processes that determine cellular function.

         <title>Recording Temperature with Magnetic Supraparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Temperature is one of the most important external influences for materials. In this work, the design, working principle, and tunability of temperature&#8208;indicator supraparticles are presented. These supraparticles can record and memorize thermal influences up to 170&#160;&#176;C with a spectral magnetic readout. The magnetic signals are independent of optical constraints and can thus be utilized to obtain information from within dark, solid objects.








Abstract
Small&#8208;sized temperature indicator additives autonomously record temperature events via a gradual irreversible signal change. This permits, for instance, the indication of possible cold&#8208;chain breaches or failure of electronics but also curing of glues. Thus, information about the materials&#8217; thermal history can be obtained upon signal detection at every point of interest. In this work, maximum&#8208;temperature indicators with magnetic readout based on micrometer&#8208;sized supraparticles (SPs) are introduced. The magnetic signal transduction is, by nature, independent of the materials&#8217; optical properties. This facilitates the determination of valuable temperature information from the inside, that is, the bulk, even of dark and opaque macroscopic objects, which might differ from their surface.

     alt="Recording Temperature with Magnetic Supraparticles"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Temperature is one of the most important external influences for materials. In this work, the design, working principle, and tunability of temperature-indicator supraparticles are presented. These supraparticles can record and memorize thermal influences up to 170&#160;&#176;C with a spectral magnetic readout. The magnetic signals are independent of optical constraints and can thus be utilized to obtain information from within dark, solid objects.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small-sized temperature indicator additives autonomously record temperature events via a gradual irreversible signal change. This permits, for instance, the indication of possible cold-chain breaches or failure of electronics but also curing of glues. Thus, information about the materials&#8217; thermal history can be obtained upon signal detection at every point of interest. In this work, maximum-temperature indicators with magnetic readout based on micrometer-sized supraparticles (SPs) are introduced. The magnetic signal transduction is, by nature, independent of the materials&#8217; optical properties. This facilitates the determination of valuable temperature information from the inside, that is, the bulk, even of dark and opaque macroscopic objects, which might differ from their surface. Compared to state-of-the-art optical temperature indicators, complementary magnetic readout characteristics ultimately expand their applicability. The conceptualized SPs are hierarchically structured assemblies of environmentally friendly, inexpensive iron oxide nanoparticles and thermoplastic polymer. Irreversible structural changes, induced by polymer softening, yield magnetic interaction changes within and between the hierarchic sub-structures, which are distinguishable and define the temperature indication mechanism. The fundamental understanding of the SPs&#8217; working principle enables customization of the particles&#8217; working range, response time, and sensitivity, using a toolbox-like manufacturing approach. The magnetic signal change is detected self-referenced, fast, and contactless.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Construction of Edge&#8208;Contacted Metal&#8208;Semiconductor Junctions with Low Contact Barrier</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile approach is developed for constructing high&#8208;quality metal&#8208;2D semiconductor junctions through the edge&#8208;guided electrodeposition. Cross&#8208;sectional imaging and transport measurements confirm the seamless contact of Pd with each layer of MoS2 greatly reduces the contact barrier to &#8776;20 meV and contact resistance to &#8776;290 &#937;&#160;&#181;m and thus significantly increases the performance of FETs with Pd nanowire edge contacts.








Abstract
2D semiconductors, such as MoS2 have emerged as promising ultrathin channel materials for the further scaling of field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). However, the contact barrier at the metal&#8208;2D semiconductor junctions still significantly limits the device's performance. By extending the application of electrochemical deposition in 2D electronics, a distinct approach is developed for constructing metal&#8208;2D semiconductor junctions in an edge&#8208;contacted configuration through the edge&#8208;guided electrodeposition of varied metals. Both high&#8208;resolution microscopic imaging and electrical transport measurements confirm the successful creation of high&#8208;quality Pd&#8208;2D MoS2 junctions in desired geometry by combining electrodeposition with lithographic patterning. FETs are fabricated on the obtained Pd&#8208;2D MoS2 junctions and it is confirmed that these junctions exhibit a reduced contact barrier of &#8776;20&#160;meV and extremely low contact resistance of 290&#160;&#937;&#160;&#181;m and thus increase the averaged mobility of MoS2 FETs to &#8776;108&#160;cm2 V &#8722;1 s&#8722;1. This approach paves a new way for the construction of metal&#8208;semiconductor junctions and also demonstrates the great potential of the electrochemical deposition technique in 2D electronics.

         <title>Topological Crystalline Insulator Candidate ErAsS with Hourglass Fermion and Magnetic&#8208;Tuned Topological Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layered air&#8208;stable topological crystalline insulator (TCI) candidate, ErAsS, is designed and synthesized, which maps the atomic layers in real space to the band topology in momentum space. The distorted As atomic layer and magnetic order of ErAsS induce both the hourglass fermion surface state and the magnetic&#8208;tuned exotic phases including the possible magnetic TCI.








Abstract
Topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) with hourglass fermion surface state have attracted a lot of attention and are further enriched by crystalline symmetries and magnetic order. Here, the emergence of hourglass fermion surface state and exotic phases in the newly discovered, air&#8208;stable ErAsS single crystals are shown. In the paramagnetic phase, ErAsS is expected to be a TCI with hourglass fermion surface state protected by the nonsymmorphic symmetry. Dirac&#8208;cone&#8208;like bands and nearly linear dispersions in large energy range are experimentally observed, consistent well with theoretical calculations. Below TN&#160;&#8776; 3.27 K, ErAsS enters a collinear antiferromagnetic state, which is a trivial insulator breaking the time&#8208;reversal symmetry. An intermediate incommensurate magnetic state appears in a narrow temperature range (3.27&#8211;3.65 K), exhibiting an abrupt change in magnetic coupling. The results reveal that ErAsS is an experimentally available TCI candidate and provide a unique platform to understand the formation of hourglass fermion surface state and explore magnetic&#8208;tuned topological phase transitions.

         <title>The Non&#8208;Classical Crystallization Mechanism of a Composite Biogenic Guanine Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By following crystal formation in embryonic spiders, a long&#8208;sought crystallization mechanism for biogenic guanine is revealed. Guanine nucleates from a disordered precursor phase. The crystals grow by the orientated attachment of partially ordered nanogranules into platelets, which coalesce into single crystals, via gradual relaxation of structural defects. The mature guanine is a composite of crystal lamellae intercalated by macromolecular sheets.








Abstract
Spectacular colors and visual phenomena in animals are produced by light interference from highly reflective guanine crystals. Little is known about how organisms regulate crystal morphology to tune the optics of these systems. By following guanine crystal formation in developing spiders, a crystallization mechanism is elucidated. Guanine crystallization is a &#8220;non&#8208;classical,&#8221; multistep process involving a progressive ordering of states. Crystallization begins with nucleation of partially ordered nanogranules from a disordered precursor phase. Growth proceeds by orientated attachment of the nanogranules into platelets which coalesce into single crystals, via progressive relaxation of structural defects. Despite their prismatic morphology, the platelet texture is retained in the final crystals, which are composites of crystal lamellae and interlamellar sheets. Interactions between the macromolecular sheets and the planar face of guanine appear to direct nucleation, favoring platelet formation. These findings provide insights on how organisms control the morphology and optical properties of molecular crystals.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Rich Molybdenum Sulfide Quantum Dots for Amplified Photoluminescence and Photonics&#8208;Driven Reactive Oxygen Species Generation</title>

Defect&#8208;rich MoS2 QDs are obtained via a mild biomineralization&#8208;assisted bottom&#8208;up strategy to show enhanced photoluminescence and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation due to great defect/active sites elevation.








Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) quantum dots (QDs) with defects have attracted interesting chemistry due to the contribution of vacancies to their unique optical, physical, catalytic, and electrical properties. Engineering defined defects into molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) QDs is challenging. Herein, by applying a mild biomineralization&#8208;assisted bottom&#8208;up strategy, blue photoluminescent MoS2 QDs (B&#8208;QDs) with a high density of defects are fabricated. The two&#8208;stage synthesis begins with a bottom&#8208;up synthesis of original MoS2 QDs (O&#8208;QDs) through chemical reactions of Mo and sulfide ions, followed by alkaline etching that creates high sulfur&#8208;vacancy defects to eventually form B&#8208;QDs. Alkaline etching significantly increases the photoluminescence (PL) and photo&#8208;oxidation. An increase in defect density is shown to bring about increased active sites and decreased bandgap energy; which is further validated with density functional theory calculations. There is strengthened binding affinity between QDs and O2 due to lower gap energy (&#8710;EST) between S1 and T1, accompanied with improved intersystem crossing (ISC) efficiency. Lowered gap energy contributes to assist e&#8722;&#8211;h+ pair formation and the strengthened binding affinity between QDs and 3O2. Defect engineering unravels another dimension of material properties control and can bring fresh new applications to otherwise well characterized TMD nanomaterials.

         <title>Composition&#8208;Dependent Enzyme Mimicking Activity and Radiosensitizing Effect of Bimetallic Clusters to Modulate Tumor Hypoxia for Enhanced Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically precise alloy clusters Pt2M4 (M = Au, Ag, Cu) are synthesized with bright luminescence and adequate biocompatibility. The experimental results reveal that the Pt2Au4 cluster displays catalase&#8208;like activity and its radiosensitizing effect is the highest. By taking advantage of the sustainable production of O2 via decomposition of endogenous H2O2, the Pt2Au4 cluster modulates tumor hypoxia as well as increases the efficacy of radiotherapy.








Abstract
Alloying is an efficient chemistry to tailor the properties of metal clusters. As a class of promising radiosensitizers, most previously reported metal clusters exhibit unitary function and cannot overcome radioresistance of hypoxic tumors. Here, atomically precise alloy clusters Pt2M4 (M = Au, Ag, Cu) are synthesized with bright luminescence and adequate biocompatibility, and their composition&#8208;dependent enzyme mimicking activity and radiosensitizing effect is explored. Specifically, only the Pt2Au4 cluster displays catalase&#8208;like activity, while the others do not have clusterzyme properties, and its radiosensitizing effect is the highest among all the alloy clusters tested. By taking advantage of the sustainable production of O2 via the decomposition of endogenous H2O2, the Pt2Au4 cluster modulates tumor hypoxia as well as increases the efficacy of radiotherapy. This work thus advances the&#160;cluster alloying strategy to produce multifunctional therapeutic agents for improving hypoxic tumor therapy.

An artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;motivated full&#8208;skin bionic (FSB) e&#8208;skin based on vertically integrated triboelectric e&#8208;skin and supercapacitive iontronic e&#8208;skin is proposed through the mimicry of skin structures including human vellus hair, epidermis&#8211;dermis&#8211;hypodermis. Assisted by the AI&#8208;motivated &#8220;brain,&#8221; the proposed FSB e&#8208;skin can promote the function of tactile perception to advanced intelligent tactile cognition.








Abstract
Traditional electronic skin (e&#8208;skin), due to the lack of human&#8208;brain&#8208;like thinking and judging capability, is powerless to accelerate the pace to the intelligent era. Herein, artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;motivated full&#8208;skin bionic (FSB) e&#8208;skin consisting of the structures of human vellus hair, epidermis&#8211;dermis&#8211;hypodermis, is proposed. Benefiting from the double interlocked layered microcone structure and supercapacitive iontronic effect, the FSB e&#8208;skin exhibits ultrahigh sensitivity of 8053.1 kPa&#8722;1 (&lt;1&#160;kPa), linear sensitivity of 3103.5 kPa&#8722;1 (1&#8211;34&#160;kPa), and fast response/recovery time of &lt;5.6&#160;ms. In addition, it can realize the evolution from tactile perception to advanced intelligent tactile cognition after being equipped with a &#8220;brain&#8221;. First, static/dynamic contactless tactile perception is achieved based on the triboelectric effect of the vellus hair bionics. Second, the supercapacitive iontronic effect based structural bionics of the epidermis&#8211;dermis&#8211;hypodermis and a five&#8208;layer multilayer perception (MLP) enable the general intelligent tactile cognition of gesture cognition and robot interaction. Most importantly, by making full use of the FSB e&#8208;skin with a six&#8208;layer MLP neural network, an advanced intelligent material cognition system is developed for real&#8208;time cognition of the object material species and locations via one contact, which surpasses the capability of humans.

         <title>Integrating SEI into Layered Conductive Polymer Coatings for Ultrastable Silicon Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layered conductive polyaniline (LCP) coating is built from a bottom&#8208;up polymer design strategy for Si anodes. The in situ formation of LCP&#8208;integrated solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with uniform structure and flexible mechanical property enhances the stability of the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface.








Abstract
Tackling the huge volume expansion of silicon (Si) anode desires a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to prohibit the interfacial side reactions. Here, a layered conductive polyaniline (LCP) coating is built on Si nanoparticles to achieve high areal capacity and long lifespan. The conformal LCP coating stores electrolyte in interlamination spaces and directs an in situ formation of LCP&#8208;integrated hybrid SEI skin with uniform distribution of organic and inorganic components, enhancing the flexibility of the SEI to buffer the volume changes and maintaining homogeneous ion transport during cycling. As a result, the Si anode shows a remarkable cycling stability under high areal capacity (&#8776;3&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2) after 150 cycles and good rate performance of 942&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1. This work demonstrates the great potential of regulating the SEI properties by a layered polymer&#8208;directing SEI formation for the mechanical and electrochemical stabilization of Si anodes.

         <title>Brushed Metals for Rechargeable Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and solvent&#8208;free brushing method is reported to convert powders into films atop Li and Na metal foils. Benefiting from the reactivity of metals with these powder films, surface energy can be effectively tuned, thereby preventing parasitic reaction. In&#8208;operando study and electrochemical tests demonstrate the improved electrodeposition/dissolution behavior, lower polarization, and higher average coulombic efficiency for P2S5 and MoS2.








Abstract
Battery designs are swiftly changing from metal&#8208;ion to rechargeable metal batteries. Theoretically, metals can deliver maximum anode capacity and enable cells with improved energy density. In practice, these advantages are only possible if the parasitic surface reactions associated with metal anodes are controlled. These undesirable surface reactions are responsible for many troublesome issues, like dendrite formation and accelerated consumption of active materials, which leads to anodes with low cycle life or even battery runaway. Here, a facile and solvent&#8208;free brushing method is reported to convert powders into films atop Li and Na metal foils. Benefiting from the reactivity of Li metal with these powder films, surface energy can be effectively tuned, thereby preventing parasitic reaction. In&#8208;operando study of P2S5&#8208;modified Li anodes in liquid electrolyte cells reveals a smoother electrode contour and more uniform metal electrodeposition and dissolution behavior. The P2S5&#8208;modified Li anodes sustain ultralow polarization in symmetric cell for &gt;4000 h, &#8776;8&#215; longer than bare Li anodes. The capacity retention is &#8776;70% higher when P2S5&#8208;modified Li anodes are paired with a practical LiFePO4 cathode (&#8776;3.2&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2) after 340 cycles. Brush coating opens a promising avenue to fabricate large&#8208;scale artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase directly on metals without the need for organic solvent.

         <title>A Snakeskin&#8208;Inspired, Soft&#8208;Hinge Kirigami Metamaterial for Self&#8208;Adaptive Conformal Electronic Armor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Survivability in complex environments is in high demand but challenging in flexible electronics or soft robotics. Snakeskin can serve as bioinspiration for employing electronic armor (E&#8208;armor) as a generic strategy to protect itself&#160;and the underlying objects from external damage. Specifically, a new concept of flexible &#8220;E&#8208;armor&#8221; as an upgrade of soft &#8220;E&#8208;skin&#8221; is introduced.








Abstract
A majority of soft&#8208;body creatures evolve armor or shells to protect themselves. Similar protection demand is for flexible electronics working in complex environments. Existing works mainly focus on improving the sensing capabilities such as electronic skin (E&#8208;skin). Inspired by snakeskin, a novel electronic armor (E&#8208;armor) is proposed, which not only possesses mechanical flexibility and electronic functions similar to E&#8208;skin, but is also able to protect itself and the underlying soft body from external physical damage. The geometry of the kirigami mechanical metamaterial (Kiri&#8208;MM) ensures auxetic stretchability and meanwhile large areal coverage for sufficient protection. Moreover, to suppress the inherent but undesired out&#8208;of&#8208;plane buckling of conventional Kiri&#8208;MMs for conformal applications, soft hinges are used to form a distinct soft (hinges)&#8208;rigid (tiles) configuration. Analytical, computational, and experimental studies of the mechanical behaviors of the soft&#8208;hinge Kiri&#8208;MM E&#8208;armor demonstrate the merits of this design, i.e., stretchability, conformability, and protectability, as applied to flexible electronics. Deploying a conductive soft material at the hinges enables facile wiring strategies for large&#8208;scale circuit arrays. Functional E&#8208;armor systems for controllable display and sensing purposes provide simple examples of a wide spectrum of applications of this concept.

         <title>Graphene&#8208;Based Intrinsically Stretchable 2D&#8208;Contact Electrodes for Highly Efficient Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protocol to fabricate highly efficient organic light&#8208;emitting diodes that use an intrinsically stretchable 2D&#8208;contact electrode topped with graphene is reported. As a benefit of the fast carrier mobility with complete 2D contact with the organic material and the tunable work function of the 2D&#8208;contact stretchable electro (TCSE), the limited charge injection of the widely used silver&#8208;nanowire&#8208;based stretchable electrode is solved.








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (ISOLEDs) are becoming essential components of wearable electronics. However, the efficiencies of ISOLEDs have been highly inferior compared with their rigid counterparts, which is due to the lack of ideal stretchable electrode materials that can overcome the poor charge injection at 1D metallic nanowire/organic interfaces. Herein, highly efficient ISOLEDs that use graphene&#8208;based 2D&#8208;contact stretchable electrodes (TCSEs) that incorporate a graphene layer on top of embedded metallic nanowires are demonstrated. The graphene layer modifies the work function, promotes charge spreading, and impedes inward diffusion of oxygen and moisture. The work function (WF) of 3.57&#160;eV is achieved by forming a strong interfacial dipole after deposition of a newly designed conjugated polyelectrolyte with crown ether and anionic sulfonate groups on TCSE; this is the lowest value ever reported among ISOLEDs, which overcomes the existing problem of very poor electron injection in ISOLEDs. Subsequent pressure&#8208;controlled lamination yields a highly efficient fluorescent ISOLED with an unprecedently high current efficiency of 20.3&#160;cd A&#8722;1, which even exceeds that of an otherwise&#8208;identical rigid counterpart. Lastly, a 3 inch five&#8208;by&#8208;five passive matrix ISOLED is demonstrated using convex stretching. This work can provide a rational protocol for designing intrinsically stretchable high&#8208;efficiency optoelectronic devices with favorable interfacial electronic structures.

         <title>Highly Selective Adsorption of Perfluorinated Greenhouse Gases by Porous Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of porous organic cages with alkyl&#8208;, fluoroalkyl&#8208;, and partially fluorinated alkyl groups is presented and the structure&#8211;property relationships between the nature of the side&#8208;chains and the gas sorption behavior toward highly potent greenhouse gases, namely, perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are studied. By this approach, one compound having superior selectivities of PFCs versus N2 or CO2 under ambient conditions is identified.








Abstract
Anthropogenic greenhouse gases contribute to global warming. Among those gases, perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are thousands to tens of thousands of times more harmful to the environment than comparable amounts of carbon dioxide. To date, materials that selectively adsorb perfluorocarbons in favor of other less harmful gases have not been reported. Here, a series of porous organic cage compounds with alkyl&#8208;, fluoroalkyl&#8208;, and partially fluorinated alkyl groups is presented. Their isomorphic crystalline states allow the study of the structure&#8211;property relationship between the degree of fluorination of the alkyl chains and the gas sorption properties for PFCs and their selective uptakes in comparison to other, nonfluorinated gases. By this approach, one compound having superior selectivities of PFCs versus N2 or CO2 under ambient conditions is identified.

         <title>Designing Rewritable Dual&#8208;Mode Patterns using a Stretchable Photoresponsive Polymer via Orthogonal Photopatterning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two patterns are observed in one film! Orthogonal photopatterning is developed to fabricate dual&#8208;mode patterns in stretchable azopolymers that exhibit photoinduced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transitions. The dual&#8208;mode pattern contains photonic and chromatic polarization patterns, which do not interfere with each other. The dual&#8208;mode patterns are rewritable and reprocessable. They are promising materials for anti&#8208;counterfeiting, information storage, and encryption applications.








Abstract
The fabrication of dual&#8208;mode patterns in the same region of a material is a promising approach for high&#8208;density information storage, new anti&#8208;counterfeiting technologies, and highly secure encryption. However, dual&#8208;mode patterns are difficult to achieve because the two patterns in one material may interfere with each other during fabrication and usage. The development of noninterfering dual&#8208;mode patterns requires new materials and patterning techniques. Herein, a novel orthogonal photopatterning technique is reported for the fabrication of noninterfering dual&#8208;mode patterns on an azopolymer P1. P1 is a unique material that exhibits both photoinduced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transitions and good stretchability. In the first step of orthogonal photopatterning, patterned photonic structures are fabricated on a P1 film via masked nanoimprinting controlled by photoinduced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transitions. In the second step, the P1 film is stretched and irradiated with polarized light through a photomask, which generates a chromatic polarization pattern. In particular, the photonic structures and chromatic polarization in the dual&#8208;mode pattern are noninterfering. Another feature of dual&#8208;mode patterns is that they are rewritable via photo&#8208;, thermal, or solution reprocessing, which are useful for recycling and reprogramming. This study opens an avenue for the development of novel materials and techniques for photopatterning.

         <title>All&#8208;Aqueous Freeform Fabrication of Perfusable Self&#8208;Standing Soft Compartments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward method based on the interfacial complexation of oppositely charged natural polyelectrolytes is proposed to directly fabricate fiber&#8208;shaped structures, stable in all&#8208;aqueous physiological&#8208;relevant conditions. Perfusable and size&#8208;controllable materials can be obtained, with adequate permeability and improved biofunctionality, enabling cell adhesion and growth. Outside the separating interface of two&#8208;phase systems, self&#8208;standing entities can be easily handled, broadening the range of applications.








Abstract
Compartmentalized structures obtained in all&#8208;aqueous settings have shown promising properties as cell encapsulation devices, as well as reactors for trans&#8208;membrane chemical reactions. While most approaches focus on the preparation of spherical devices, advances on the production of complex architectures have been enabled by the interfacial stability conferred by emulsion systems, namely mild aqueous two&#8208;phase systems (ATPS), or non&#8208;equilibrated analogues.

     alt="All-Aqueous Freeform Fabrication of Perfusable Self-Standing Soft Compartments"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A straightforward method based on the interfacial complexation of oppositely charged natural polyelectrolytes is proposed to directly fabricate fiber-shaped structures, stable in all-aqueous physiological-relevant conditions. Perfusable and size-controllable materials can be obtained, with adequate permeability and improved biofunctionality, enabling cell adhesion and growth. Outside the separating interface of two-phase systems, self-standing entities can be easily handled, broadening the range of applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compartmentalized structures obtained in all-aqueous settings have shown promising properties as cell encapsulation devices, as well as reactors for trans-membrane chemical reactions. While most approaches focus on the preparation of spherical devices, advances on the production of complex architectures have been enabled by the interfacial stability conferred by emulsion systems, namely mild aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS), or non-equilibrated analogues. However, the application of non-spherical structures has mostly been reported while keeping the fabricated materials at a stable interface, limiting the free-standing character, mobility and transposition of the obtained structures to different setups. Here, the fabrication of self-standing, malleable and perfusable tubular systems through all-aqueous interfacial assembly is shown, culminating in the preparation of independent objects with stability and homogeneity after disruption of the polymer-based aqueous separating system. Those hollow structures can be fabricated with a variety of widths, and rapidly printed as long structures at flow rates of 15&#160;mm s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The materials are used as compartments for cell culture, showcasing high cytocompatibility, and can be tailored to promote cell adhesion. Such structures may find application in fields that benefit from freeform tubular structures, including the biomedical field with, for example, cell encapsulation, and benchtop preparation of microfluidic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Based on the impedance&#8208;voltage division principle and the voltage&#8208;luminance relationship, simply fabricated asymmetrically enhanced alternating&#8208;current&#8208;driven electroluminescent (AECE AC&#8208;EL) devices are designed. The AECE AC&#8208;EL configuration is successfully applied in feasible information encryption and ultrahighly stretchable pattern displays, signifying magnificent application prospects in the elegant wearable electronic systems with intelligent, multifunctional, and full&#8208;color displays.








Abstract
Traditional alternating&#8208;current&#8208;driven electroluminescent (AC&#8208;EL) devices adopting a sandwich structure are commonly used in solid&#8208;state lighting and displays, while the emerging coplanar&#8208;electrode alternating&#8208;current&#8208;driven light&#8208;emitting variants manifest excellent application prospects in intelligent, multifunctional, and full&#8208;color displays, and sensing purposes. In this work, an asymmetrically&#160;enhanced coplanar&#8208;electrode AC&#8208;EL device with a universal and straightforward architecture is designed based on the impedance adjustment strategy. This newly devised asymmetric structure extends the functionalities of the coplanar&#8208;electrode AC&#8208;EL devices by overcoming the bottlenecks of complicated patterning procedures and high driving voltages of symmetric configuration. The developed device design enables a new type of information encryption and ultrahighly stretchable patterned displays. Notably, the novel encryption appliances demonstrate feasible encryption/decryption features, multiple encryptions, and practical applicability; the biaxially stretchable display devices achieve the highest tensile performance in the field of stretchable electroluminescent pattern displays, and outperform the ultrahighly stretchable sandwich devices in terms of simple patterning process, higher brightness, wider color gamut, and long&#8208;term stability. The proposed configuration opens up new avenues for AC&#8208;EL devices toward a plethora of smart applications in wearable electronics with intelligent displays, dynamic interaction of human&#8208;machine interface, and soft robotics.

         <title>Rhombohedral Pd&#8211;Sb Nanoplates with Pd&#8208;Terminated Surface: An Efficient Bifunctional Fuel&#8208;Cell Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Pd&#8211;Sb hexagonal nanoplate of ordered rhombohedral Pd8Sb3 phase with a Pd&#8208;terminated surface is successfully prepared and applied as a high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalyst. The unique surface structure can effectively reduce the energy barrier of ethanol dehydrogenation in the ethanol oxidation reaction&#160;and suppress the competing two&#8208;electron pathway in the oxygen reduction reaction, leading to high&#8208;efficiency bifunctional electrocatalysis for energy conversion and beyond.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is essential for the commercialization of direct ethanol fuel cells, but it is still formidably challenging. In this work, a novel Pd&#8211;Sb hexagonal nanoplate for boosting both cathodic and anodic fuel cell reactions is prepared. Detailed characterizations reveal that the nanoplates have ordered rhombohedral phase of Pd8Sb3 (denoted as Pd8Sb3 HPs). The Pd8Sb3 HPs exhibit&#160;much enhanced activity toward the oxidation of various alcohols. Particularly, Pd8Sb3 HPs/C displays superior specific and mass activities of 29.3&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 4.5&#160;A&#160;mgPd&#8722;1 toward the EOR, which are 7.0 and 11.3 times higher than those of commercial Pd/C, and 9.8 and 3.8 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively, representing one of the best EOR catalysts reported to date. In situ electrochemical attenuated total reflectance surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) measurements reveal that Pd8Sb3 HPs/C can effectively promote the C2 pathway of the EOR. As revealed by density functional theory calculations, the high EOR activity of the Pd8Sb3 HPs can be ascribed to the reduced energy barrier of ethanol dehydrogenation. Additionally, Pd8Sb3 HPs/C also shows superior performance in the&#160;ORR. This work advances the controllable synthesis of the Pd&#8211;Sb nanostructure, giving huge impetus for the design&#160;of high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts for energy conversion and beyond.

         <title>Revealing the Structural Coloration of Self&#8208;Assembled Chitin Nanocrystal Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chitin nanocrystals can be sustainably extracted from mushrooms and shrimp shells. These elongated nanoparticles spontaneously organize in water to form a chiral nematic mesophase. Upon evaporation, this helicoidal architecture is preserved, resulting in structurally colored films. An alkaline post&#8208;treatment to convert chitin into chitosan is found to significantly enhance the birefringence, resulting in vibrant red, green, and blue coloration.








Abstract
The structural coloration of arthropods often arises from helicoidal structures made primarily of chitin. Although it is possible to achieve analogous helicoidal architectures by exploiting the self&#8208;assembly of chitin nanocrystals (ChNCs), to date no evidence of structural coloration has been reported from such structures. Previous studies are identified to have been constrained by both the experimental inability to access sub&#8208;micrometer helicoidal pitches and the intrinsically low birefringence of crystalline chitin. To expand the range of accessible pitches, here, ChNCs are isolated from two phylogenetically distinct sources of &#945;&#8208;chitin, namely fungi and shrimp, while to increase the birefringence, an in situ alkaline treatment is performed, increasing the intensity of the reflected color by nearly two orders of magnitude. By combining this treatment with precise control over ChNC suspension formulation, structurally colored chitin&#8208;based films are demonstrated with reflection tunable from blue to near infrared.

         <title>3R Electronics: Scalable Fabrication of Resilient, Repairable, and Recyclable Soft&#8208;Matter Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
3R&#8208;electronics are introduced here: the next generation of soft&#8208;matter electronics that are Resilient, Repairable and Recyclable. It is proposed that 3R&#8208;electronics should replace current electronics, as they permit sustainable circular economy. 3R&#8208;electronics are implemented through novel liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;based composites, unique high&#8208;resolution digital fabrication techniques, and an unprecedented room&#8208;temperature soldering method that permits for the first time, utilization of heat&#8208;sensitive polymers in microchip&#8208;integrated circuits.








Abstract
E&#8208;waste is rapidly turning into another man&#8208;made disaster. It is proposed that a paradigm shift toward a more sustainable future can be made through soft&#8208;matter electronics that are resilient, repairable if damaged, and recyclable (3R), provided that they achieve the same level of maturity as industrial electronics. This includes high&#8208;resolution patterning, multilayer implementation, microchip integration, and automated fabrication. Herein, a novel architecture of materials and methods for microchip&#8208;integrated condensed soft&#8208;matter 3R electronics is demonstrated. The 3R function is enabled by a biphasic liquid metal&#8208;based composite, a block copolymer with nonpermanent physical crosslinks, and an electrochemical technique for material recycling. In addition, an autonomous laser&#8208;patterning method for scalable circuit patterning with an exceptional resolution of &lt;30&#160;&#181;m in seconds is developed. The phase&#8208;shifting property of the BCPs is utilized for vapor&#8208;assisted &#8220;soldering&#8221; circuit repairing and recycling. The process is performed entirely at room temperature, thereby opening the door for a wide range of heat&#8208;sensitive and biodegradable polymers for the next generation of green electronics. The implementation and recycling of sophisticated skin&#8208;mounted patches with embedded sensors, electrodes, antennas, and microchips that build a digital fingerprint of the human electrophysiological signals is demonstrated by collecting mechanical, electrical, optical, and thermal data from the epidermis.

     alt="3R Electronics: Scalable Fabrication of Resilient, Repairable, and Recyclable Soft-Matter Electronics"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3R-electronics are introduced here: the next generation of soft-matter electronics that are Resilient, Repairable and Recyclable. It is proposed that 3R-electronics should replace current electronics, as they permit sustainable circular economy. 3R-electronics are implemented through novel liquid-metal-based composites, unique high-resolution digital fabrication techniques, and an unprecedented room-temperature soldering method that permits for the first time, utilization of heat-sensitive polymers in microchip-integrated circuits.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E-waste is rapidly turning into another man-made disaster. It is proposed that a paradigm shift toward a more sustainable future can be made through soft-matter electronics that are resilient, repairable if damaged, and recyclable (3R), provided that they achieve the same level of maturity as industrial electronics. This includes high-resolution patterning, multilayer implementation, microchip integration, and automated fabrication. Herein, a novel architecture of materials and methods for microchip-integrated condensed soft-matter 3R electronics is demonstrated. The 3R function is enabled by a biphasic liquid metal-based composite, a block copolymer with nonpermanent physical crosslinks, and an electrochemical technique for material recycling. In addition, an autonomous laser-patterning method for scalable circuit patterning with an exceptional resolution of &amp;lt;30&#160;&#181;m in seconds is developed. The phase-shifting property of the BCPs is utilized for vapor-assisted &#8220;soldering&#8221; circuit repairing and recycling. The process is performed entirely at room temperature, thereby opening the door for a wide range of heat-sensitive and biodegradable polymers for the next generation of green electronics. The implementation and recycling of sophisticated skin-mounted patches with embedded sensors, electrodes, antennas, and microchips that build a digital fingerprint of the human electrophysiological signals is demonstrated by collecting mechanical, electrical, optical, and thermal data from the epidermis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Iron Anchored Tubular g&#8208;C3N4 Catalysts for Ultrafast Fenton&#8208;Like Reaction: Roles of High&#8208;Valency Iron&#8208;Oxo Species and Organic Radicals</title>

         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersing Fe(III) sites into fine&#8208;tuned nitrogen&#8208;rich graphitic carbon nitride nanotubes are designed for peracetic acid activation and further for Fenton&#8208;like reactions. This work opens a new avenue to develop heterogenous catalytic systems with higher reactivity and better durability using a double engine mechanism.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts have emerged as an efficient oxidant activator for eliminating organic pollutants in Fenton&#8208;like systems. However, the complex preparation, single active site, lack of understanding of the fundamental mechanism, and harsh pH conditions currently limit their practical applications. In this work, single&#8208;atom iron anchored nitrogen&#8208;rich g&#8208;C3N4 nanotubes (FeCNs) are designed and synthesized by a facile approach, and eco&#8208;friendly peracetic acid (PAA) is selected as the oxidant for Fenton&#8208;like reactions. The constructed heterogenous system achieves an enhanced degradation of various organic contaminants over a wide pH range of 3.0&#8211;9.0, exhibiting an ultrahigh and stable catalytic activity, outperforming equivalent quantities of pristine g&#8208;C3N4 by 75 times. The 18O isotope&#8208;labeling technique, probe method, and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the efficient catalytic activity relies on the high&#8208;valency iron&#8208;oxo species coupled with organic radicals generated by PAA. An increase in electron transport from the contaminant to the formed &#8220;metastable PAA/FeCN catalyst surface complex&#8221; is detected. A double driving mechanism for the tubular g&#8208;C3N4 regulated by a single Fe site and PAA activation is proposed. This work opens an avenue for developing novel catalysts with the coexistence of multiple active units and providing opportunities for significantly improving catalytic efficiency.

         <title>An Encapsulation&#8208;Based Sodium Storage via Zn&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Implanted Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designing a functional encapsulation&#8208;based sodium storage void with abundant pore structure and enriched Zn single atom sites in the inner wall is presented here. Zn single atoms provide abundant selective sodiophilic nucleation sites. Due to the rich pore structure, ZIF&#8208;derived carbon shells can provide geometric constraints and excellent ion/electron transport channels to maintain fast electron/ion contact, benefiting for encapsulating large amounts of metallic sodium.








Abstract
The properties of high theoretical capacity, low cost, and large potential of metallic sodium (Na) has strongly promoted the development of rechargeable sodium&#8208;based batteries. However, the issues of infinite volume variation, unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), and dendritic sodium causes a rapid decline in performance and notorious safety hazards. Herein, a highly reversible encapsulation&#8208;based sodium storage by designing a functional hollow carbon nanotube with Zn single atom sites embedded in the carbon shell (ZnSA&#8208;HCNT) is achieved. The appropriate tube space can encapsulate bulk sodium inside; the inner enriched ZnSA sites provide abundant sodiophilic sites, which can evidently reduce the nucleation barrier of Na deposition. Moreover, the carbon shell derived from ZIF&#8208;8 provides geometric constraints and excellent ion/electron transport channels for the rapid transfer of Na+ due to its pore&#8208;rich shell, which can be revealed by in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As expected, Na@ZnSA&#8208;HCNT anodes present steady long&#8208;term performance in symmetrical battery (&gt;900 h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). Moreover, superior electrochemical performance of Na@ZnSA&#8208;HCNT||PB full cells can be delivered. This work develops a new strategy based on carbon nanotube encapsulation of metallic sodium, which improves the safety and cycling performance of sodium metal anode.

         <title>Uneven Stripping Behavior, an Unheeded&#160;Killer of Mg Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An astonishingly uniform electroplating morphology is proven under practical current density and areal capacity in rechargeable Mg batteries, and an asymmetric phenomenon between the plating and stripping processes is discovered. More critically, a nonlinear volcano relation between the non&#8208;uniformity of the stripping morphology and the current density is proposed, which is defined by the distribution of chlorine&#8208;containing complex ions at the interface.








Abstract
Uniform magnesium (Mg) plating/stripping under high areal capacity utilization is critical for the practical application of Mg&#8208;metal anodes in rechargeable Mg batteries. However, the failure of the Mg&#8208;metal anode when cycling under a practical areal capacity (&gt;4&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;cm&#8722;2), is of rising concern. The mechanism behind these failures remains controversial. In this work, it is illustrated that the initial plating Mg can be undoubtedly uniform in a wide range of current densities (&#8804;5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and under a practical areal capacity (6&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;cm&#8722;2). However, an unusual self&#8208;accelerating pit growth is observed in the Mg stripping side under moderate current densities (0.1&#8211;1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2), which severely deteriorates the anode integrity and subsequent Mg plating uniformity, causing failure of the Mg&#8208;metal anode or short circuit of the battery. The stripping morphology depends on the applied current density, as non&#8208;uniformity versus the current density displays a volcano plot during the stripping process. Through in situ spectroscopy, it is illustrated that this current&#8208;dependent behavior is determined by the evolution of chlorine&#8208;containing complex ions near the interface. This research reminds that the plating/stripping process of the Mg&#8208;metal anode must be considered comprehensively for practical Mg&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Atomic and Electronic Manipulation of Robust Ferroelectric Polymorphs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
True 2D ferroelectricity up to T&#160;= 400 K is achieved via atomic and electronic manipulation of polymorphs in Mo1&#8722;xWxTe2, developing an original phase diagram for ferroelectricity in atomically thin materials.








Abstract
Polymorphism allows the symmetry of the lattice and spatial charge distributions of atomically thin materials to be designed. While various polymorphs for superconducting, magnetic, and topological states have been extensively studied, polymorphic control is a challenge for robust ferroelectricity in atomically thin geometries. Here, the atomic and electric manipulation of ferroelectric polymorphs in Mo1&#8722;xWxTe2 is reported. Atomic manipulation for polymorphic control via chemical pressure (substituting tungsten for molybdenum atoms) and charge density modulation can realize tunable polar lattice structures and robust ferroelectricity up to T&#160;= 400 K with a constant coercive field in an atomically thin material. Owing to the effective inversion symmetry breaking, the ferroelectric switching withstands a charge carrier density of up to 1.1 &#215; 1013 cm&#8722;2, developing an original diagram for ferroelectric switching in atomically thin materials.

Atomic manipulation for polymorphic control via chemical pressure (substituting tungsten for molybdenum atoms) and charge density modulation can realize tunable polar lattice structures and robust ferroelectricity up to &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&#160;= 400 K with a constant coercive field in an atomically thin material. Owing to the effective inversion symmetry breaking, the ferroelectric switching withstands a charge carrier density of up to 1.1 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, developing an original diagram for ferroelectric switching in atomically thin materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stable and Bright Electroluminescent Devices utilizing Emissive 0D Perovskite Nanocrystals Incorporated in a 3D CsPbBr3 Matrix</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly luminescent 0D Cs4PbBr6 nanocrystals are incorporated into 3D CsPbBr3 films&#160;to form single&#8208;layer perovskite light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells. The 0D Cs4PbBr6 nanocrystals improve the maximum luminance to 11&#8239;200&#160;cd m&#8722;2, the power efficiency to 33.0 Lm W&#8722;1, the external quantum efficiency to 8.3%, and the operational stability to 129 h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The 0D cesium lead halide perovskite Cs4PbBr6 has drawn remarkable interest due to its highly efficient robust green emission compared to its 3D CsPbBr3 counterpart. However, seizing the advantages of the superior photoluminescence properties for practical light&#8208;emitting devices remains elusive. To date, Cs4PbBr6 has been employed only as a higher&#8208;bandgap nonluminescent matrix to passivate or provide quantum/dielectric confinement to CsPbBr3 in light&#8208;emitting devices and to enhance its photo&#8208;/thermal/environmental stability. To resolve this disparity, a novel solvent engineering method to incorporate highly luminescent 0D Cs4PbBr6 nanocrystals (perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs)) into a 3D CsPbBr3 film, forming the active emissive layer in single&#8208;layer perovskite light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (PeLECs) is designed. A dramatic increase of the maximum external quantum efficiency and luminance from 2.7% and 6050&#160;cd m&#8722;2 for a 3D&#8208;only PeLEC to 8.3% and 11&#8239;200&#160;cd m&#8722;2 for a 3D&#8211;0D PNC device with only 7% by weight of 0D PNCs is observed. The majority of this increase is driven by the efficient inherent emission of the 0D PNCs, while the concomitant morphology improvement also contributes to reduced leakage current, reduced hysteresis, and enhanced operational lifetime (half&#8208;life of 129 h), making this one of the best&#8208;performing LECs reported to date.

         <title>Observation of Topological Edge States in Thermal Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological phases have been demonstrated in various wave systems, however, they still remain unexplored in a purely diffusive system. This work reveals the topological phase in a&#160;purely diffusive system, that is, a thermal lattice. The experimental results show that the nontrivial topological phase of the thermal lattice can enable thermal edge states that exponentially decay within the gap of bulk decays.








Abstract
Topological band theory predicts that bulk materials with nontrivial topological phases support topological edge states. This phenomenon is universal for various wave systems and is widely observed for electromagnetic and acoustic waves. Here, the notion of band topology is extended from wave to diffusion dynamics. Unlike wave systems that are usually Hermitian, diffusion systems are anti&#8208;Hermitian with purely imaginary eigenvalues corresponding to decay rates. By direct probe of the temperature diffusion, the Hamiltonian of a thermal lattice is experimentally retrieved, and the emergence of topological edge decays is observed within the gap of bulk decays. The results of this work show that such edge states exhibit robust decay rates, which are topologically protected against disorder. This work constitutes a thermal analogue of topological insulators and paves the way to exploring defect&#8208;immune heat dissipation.

         <title>Unraveling Device Physics of Dilute&#8208;Donor Narrow&#8208;Bandgap Organic Solar Cells with Highly Transparent Active Layers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Active layers for (semi&#8208;)transparent organic photovoltaics (ST&#8208;OPVs) must meet high transparency requirements for integrated energy&#8208;harvesting solutions. A pathway towards high visible transparency is combining a near&#8208;infrared&#8208;absorbing acceptor material with small fractions of a visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing donor component. An in&#8208;depth analysis of three blend systems yields an in&#8208;depth understanding of the device physics upon reduction of the donor.








Abstract
The charge generation&#8211;recombination dynamics in three narrow&#8208;bandgap near&#8208;IR absorbing nonfullerene (NFA) based organic photovoltaic (OPV) systems with varied donor concentrations of 40%, 30%, and 20% are investigated. The dilution of the polymer donor with visible&#8208;range absorption leads to highly transparent active layers with blend average visible transmittance (AVT) values of 64%, 70%, and 77%, respectively. Opaque devices in the optimized highly reproducible device configuration comprising these transparent active layers lead to photoconversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 7.0%, 6.5%, and 4.1%. The investigation of these structures yields quantitative insights into changes in the charge generation, non&#8208;geminate charge recombination, and extraction dynamics upon dilution of the donor. Lastly, this study gives an outlook for employing the highly transparent active layers in semitransparent organic photovoltaics (ST&#8208;OPVs).

Photoactive Materials
Next&#8208;generation photovoltaics will be lightweight, flexible, and (semi)transparent. Highly transparent organic photoactive materials are reported by Thuc&#8208;Quyen Nguyen, Viktor Brus, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2203796. The changes in the fundamental processes in solar cells comprising a near&#8208;IR&#8208;absorbing acceptor and a visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing donor are revealed upon dilution of the donor material, paving the way for integrated energy&#8208;harvesting solutions based on semitransparent organic photovoltaics.

Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes
Intrinsically stretchable light&#8208;emitting diodes (ISOLEDs) are becoming increasingly important for wearable electronics. In article number 2203040, Han&#8208;Young Woo, Tae&#8208;Woo Lee, and co&#8208;workers report the design of highly efficient ISOLEDs that use a graphene&#8208;based 2D&#8208;contact stretchable electrode. As a benefit of a newly designed conjugated polyelectrolyte with efficient electron injection capability, the ISOLED yields an unprecedently high current efficiency of 20.3 cd A&#8722;1.

Various strategies to simultaneously enhance the photovoltaic and mechanical properties of the active layer, ranging from material design to fabrication control, are emphasized.








Abstract
Recent advances in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) have greatly enhanced their commercial viability. Considering the technical standards (e.g., mechanical robustness) required for wearable electronics, which are promising application platforms for OSCs, the development of fully stretchable OSCs (f&#8208;SOSCs) should be accelerated. Here, a comprehensive overview of f&#8208;SOSCs, which are aimed to reliably operate under various forms of mechanical stress, including bending and multidirectional stretching, is provided. First, the mechanical requirements of f&#8208;SOSCs, in terms of tensile and cohesion/adhesion properties, are summarized along with the experimental methods to evaluate those properties. Second, essential studies to make each layer of f&#8208;SOSCs stretchable and efficient are discussed, emphasizing strategies to simultaneously enhance the photovoltaic and mechanical properties of the active layer, ranging from material design to fabrication control. Key improvements to the other components/layers (i.e., substrate, electrodes, and interlayers) are also covered. Lastly, considering that f&#8208;SOSC research is in its infancy, the current challenges and future prospects are explored.

         <title>Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Based Hollow Mesoporous Nanoparticles: Synthesis Strategies and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in the synthesis and catalysis&#8208;related applications of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based hollow mesoporous nanoparticles (HMNs) is summarized in detail. This Review will help the readers to understand the challenges and more importantly provide insights into designing novel multifunctional HMN&#8208;based nanomaterials.








Abstract
As second&#8208;generation mesoporous materials, mesoporous noble metals (NMs) are of significant interest for their wide applications in catalysis, sensing, bioimaging, and biotherapy owing to their structural and metallic features. The introduction of interior hollow cavity into NM&#8208;based mesoporous nanoparticles (MNs), which subtly integrate hierarchical hollow and mesoporous structure into one nanoparticle, produces a new type of hollow MNs (HMNs). Benefiting from their higher active surface, better electron/mass transfer, optimum electronic structure, and nanoconfinement space, NM&#8208;based HMNs exhibit their high efficiency in enhancing catalytic activity and stability and tuning catalytic selectivity. In this review, recent progress in the design, synthesis, and catalytic applications of NM&#8208;based HMNs is summarized, including the findings of the groups. Five main strategies for synthesizing NM&#8208;based HMNs, namely silica&#8208;assisted surfactant&#8208;templated nucleation, surfactant&#8208;templated sequential nucleation, soft &#8220;dual&#8221;&#8208;template, Kirkendall effect in synergistic template, and galvanic&#8208;replacement&#8208;assisted surfactant template, are described in detail. In addition, the applications in ethanol oxidation electrocatalysis and hydrogenation reactions are discussed to highlight the high activity, enhanced stability, and optimal selectivity of NM&#8208;based HMNs in (electro)catalysis.

&lt;p&gt;Recent progress in the synthesis and catalysis-related applications of noble-metal-based hollow mesoporous nanoparticles (HMNs) is summarized in detail. This Review will help the readers to understand the challenges and more importantly provide insights into designing novel multifunctional HMN-based nanomaterials.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As second-generation mesoporous materials, mesoporous noble metals (NMs) are of significant interest for their wide applications in catalysis, sensing, bioimaging, and biotherapy owing to their structural and metallic features. The introduction of interior hollow cavity into NM-based mesoporous nanoparticles (MNs), which subtly integrate hierarchical hollow and mesoporous structure into one nanoparticle, produces a new type of hollow MNs (HMNs). Benefiting from their higher active surface, better electron/mass transfer, optimum electronic structure, and nanoconfinement space, NM-based HMNs exhibit their high efficiency in enhancing catalytic activity and stability and tuning catalytic selectivity. In this review, recent progress in the design, synthesis, and catalytic applications of NM-based HMNs is summarized, including the findings of the groups. Five main strategies for synthesizing NM-based HMNs, namely silica-assisted surfactant-templated nucleation, surfactant-templated sequential nucleation, soft &#8220;dual&#8221;-template, Kirkendall effect in synergistic template, and galvanic-replacement-assisted surfactant template, are described in detail. In addition, the applications in ethanol oxidation electrocatalysis and hydrogenation reactions are discussed to highlight the high activity, enhanced stability, and optimal selectivity of NM-based HMNs in (electro)catalysis. Finally, the further outlook that may lead the directions of synthesis and applications of NM-based HMNs is prospected.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
