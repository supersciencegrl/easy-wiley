         <title>In&#160;Liquido Computation with Electrochemical Transistors and Mixed Conductors for Intelligent Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>

Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have&#160;emerged as ideal elements for a multitude of applications in bioelectronics. However, integration of multiple OECTs is still challenging because the electrolyte &#8220;shorts&#8221; all the devices producing unwanted crosstalk. Such crosstalks are explained and modeled and strategies to avoid it, or alternatively, to harness it in order to produce intelligent bioelectronics are discussed.








Abstract
Next&#8208;generation implantable computational devices require long&#8208;term&#8208;stable electronic components capable of operating in, and interacting with, electrolytic surroundings without being damaged. Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) emerged as fitting candidates. However, while single devices feature impressive figures&#160;of merit, integrated circuits (ICs) immersed in common electrolytes are hard to realize using electrochemical transistors, and there is no clear path forward for optimal top&#8208;down circuit design and high&#8208;density integration. The simple observation that two OECTs immersed in the same electrolytic medium will inevitably interact hampers their implementation in complex circuitry. The electrolyte's ionic conductivity connects all the devices in the liquid, producing unwanted and often unforeseeable dynamics. Minimizing or harnessing this crosstalk has been the focus of very recent studies. Herein, the main challenges, trends, and opportunities for realizing OECT&#8208;based circuitry in a liquid environment that could circumnavigate the hard limits of engineering and human physiology, are discussed. The most successful approaches in autonomous bioelectronics and information processing are analyzed. Elaborating on the strategies to circumvent and harness device crosstalk proves that platforms capable of complex computation and even machine learning (ML) can be realized in&#160;liquido using mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors (OMIECs).

         <title>Acidity&#8208;Triggered Transformable Polypeptide Self&#8208;Assembly to Initiate Tumor&#8208;Specific Biomineralization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;responsive transformable polypeptide nanoparticle is shown to initiate selective biomineralization for effective blockade therapy of osteosarcoma after activation by the acidic tumor microenvironment, which triggers continuous ion deposition to construct a mineralized barrier around the tumor and alleviates bone dissolution to suppress osteosarcoma progression, indicating significant potential for clinical osteosarcoma therapy.








Abstract
Biomineralization is a normal physiological process that includes nucleation, crystal growth, phase transformation, and orientation evolution. Notably, artificially induced biomineralization in the tumor tissue has emerged as an unconventional yet promising modality for malignancy therapy. However, the modest ion&#8208;chelating capabilities of carboxyl&#8208;containing biomineralization initiators lead to a deficient blockade, thus compromising antitumor efficacy. Herein, a biomineralization&#8208;inducing nanoparticle (BINP) is developed for blockade therapy of osteosarcoma. BINP is composed of dodecylamine&#8208;poly((&#947;&#8208;dodecyl&#8208;l&#8208;glutamate)&#8208;co&#8208;(l&#8208;histidine))&#8208;block&#8208;poly(l&#8208;glutamate&#8208;graft&#8208;alendronate) and combines a cytomembrane&#8208;insertion moiety, a tumor&#8208;microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive component, and an ion&#8208;chelating motif. After intravenous injection into osteosarcoma&#8208;bearing mice, BINP responds to the acidic TME to expose the dodecyl group on the surface of the expanded nanoparticles, facilitating their cytomembrane insertion. Subsequently, the protruding bisphosphonic acid group triggers continuous ion deposition to construct a mineralized barrier around the tumor, which blocks substance exchange between the tumor and surrounding normal tissues. The BINP&#8208;mediated blockade therapy displays tumor inhibition rates of 59.3% and 52.1% for subcutaneous and orthotopic osteosarcomas, respectively, compared with the Control group. In addition, the suppression of osteoclasts by the alendronate moiety alleviates bone dissolution and further inhibits pulmonary metastases. Hence, the BINP&#8208;initiated selective biomineralization provides a promising alternative for clinical osteosarcoma therapy.

         <title>An Ultrathin Nonporous Polymer Separator Regulates Na Transfer Toward Dendrite&#8208;Free Sodium Storage Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ultrathin exterior&#8208;nonporous polymer separator composed of honeycomb&#8208;structured fibers is prepared for high&#8208;energy sodium storage batteries. It effectively suppresses Na dendrites and avoids the related safety risk, as&#160;well&#160;as shows the ability to customize the highly aggregated solvation structure of electrolytes via substantial solvent immobilization, thereby leading to ion&#8208;conductivity&#8208;enhanced inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase and cathode electrolyte interphase.








Abstract
Sodium storage batteries are one of the ever&#8208;increasing next&#8208;generation large&#8208;scale energy storage systems owing to the abundant resources and low cost. However, their viability is severely hampered by dendrite&#8208;related hazards on anodes. Herein, a novel ultrathin (8 &#181;m) exterior&#8208;nonporous separator composed of honeycomb&#8208;structured fibers is prepared for homogeneous Na deposition and suppressed dendrite penetration. The unhindered ion transmission greatly benefits&#160;from honeycomb&#8208;structured fibers with huge electrolyte uptake (376.7%) and the polymer's inherent transport ability. Additionally, polar polymer chains consisting of polyethersulfone and polyvinylidene customize the highly aggregated solvation structure of electrolytes via substantial solvent immobilization, facilitating ion&#8208;conductivity&#8208;enhanced inorganic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase with remarkable interface endurance. With the reliable mechanical strength of the&#160;separator, the assembled sodium&#8208;ion full cell delivers significantly improved energy density and high safety,&#160;enabling stable operation under cutting and rolling. The as&#8208;prepared separator can further be generalized to lithium&#8208;based batteries for which apparent dendrite inhibition and cyclability are accessible and demonstrates its potential for practical application.

         <title>An Engineered Living Intestinal Muscle Patch Produces Macroscopic Contractions that can Mix and Break Down Artificial Intestinal Contents</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered intestinal muscle patch is created in vitro to generate three distinct contraction modes. It shows record strength of contractility, strong enough to mix and physically triturate viscoelastic gels that mimic the mechanical properties of the intestinal digesta. Generating such muscle patches depends on both biochemical signals from the medium and environmental cues from a bioscaffold.








Abstract
The intestinal muscle layers execute various gut wall movements to achieve controlled propulsion and mixing of intestinal content. Engineering intestinal muscle layers with complex contractile function is critical for developing bioartificial intestinal tissue to treat patients with short bowel syndrome. Here, the first demonstration of a living intestinal muscle patch capable of generating three distinct motility patterns and displaying multiple digesta manipulations&#160;is reported. Assessment of contractility, cellular morphology, and transcriptome profile reveals that successful generation of the contracting muscle patch relies on both biological factors in a serum&#8208;free medium and environmental cues from an elastic electrospun gelatin scaffold. By comparing gene&#8208;expression patterns among samples, it is shown that biological factors from the medium strongly affect ion&#8208;transport activities, while the scaffold unexpectedly regulates cell&#8211;cell communication. Analysis of ligandreceptor interactome identifies scaffold&#8208;driven changes in intercellular communication, and 78% of the upregulated ligand&#8211;receptor interactions are involved in the development and function of enteric neurons. The discoveries highlight the importance of combining biomolecular and biomaterial approaches for tissue engineering. The living intestinal muscle patch represents a pivotal advancement for building functional replacement intestinal tissue. It offers a more physiological model for studying GI motility and for preclinical drug discovery.

Printing solid&#8211;liquid biphasic liquid metal patterns on the hygroscopic hyperbranched polymer substrate demonstrates a self&#8208;healing, reconfigurable device platform with thermal&#8208;switching stiffness and adhesion. Triggered by the increased temperature, the device platform conforms and adheres to the textured skin or other 3D curvilinear surfaces can provide an integrated remote monitoring system for non&#8208;invasive, continuous, long&#8208;term health monitoring of people and structures.








Abstract
Soft, deformable electronic devices provide the means to monitor physiological information and health conditions for disease diagnostics. However, their practical utility is limited due to the lack of intrinsical thermal switching for mechanically transformative adaptability and self&#8208;healing capability against mechanical damages. Here, the design concepts, materials and physics, manufacturing approaches, and application opportunities of self&#8208;healing, reconfigurable, thermal&#8208;switching device platforms based on hyperbranched polymers and biphasic liquid metal are reported. The former provides excellent self&#8208;healing performance and unique tunable stiffness and adhesion regulated by temperature for the on&#8208;skin switch, whereas the latter results in liquid metal circuits with extreme stretchability (&gt;900%) and high conductivity (3.40&#160;&#215;&#160;104&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1), as well as simple recycling capability. Triggered by the increased temperature from the skin surface, a multifunctional device platform can conveniently conform and strongly adhere to the hierarchically textured skin surface for non&#8208;invasive, continuous, comfortable health monitoring. Additionally, the self&#8208;healing and adhesive characteristics allow multiple multifunctional circuit components to assemble and completely wrap on 3D curvilinear surfaces. Together, the design, manufacturing, and proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of the self&#8208;healing, transformative, and self&#8208;assembled electronics open up new opportunities for robust soft deformable devices, smart robotics, prosthetics, and Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things, and human&#8211;machine interfaces on irregular surfaces.

         <title>Pt&#8208;Quantum&#8208;Dot&#8208;Modified Sulfur&#8208;Doped NiFe Layered Double Hydroxide for High&#8208;Current&#8208;Density Alkaline Water Splitting at Industrial Temperature</title>

To obtain exceptional performance for industrial water splitting at high current densities, Pt&#8208;quantum&#8208;dot&#8208;modified NiFe layered double hydroxides are designed. Benefiting from optimized mass transfer and enhanced hydrogen release, its mass activity is 2.7 times higher than that of 40% Pt/C in hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Suitable electrocatalysts for industrial water splitting can veritably promote practical hydrogen applications. Rational surface design is exceptionally significant for electrocatalysts to bridge the gap between fundamental science and industrial expectation in water splitting. Here, Pt&#8208;quantum&#8208;dot&#8208;modified sulfur&#8208;doped NiFe layered double hydroxides (Pt@S&#8211;NiFe LDHs) are designed with eximious catalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under industrial&#160;condition. Benefiting from enhanced binding energy, mass transfer, and hydrogen release, Pt@S&#8211;NiFe LDHs exhibit outstanding activity in HER at high current densities. Notably, it obtains an impressively low overpotential of 71&#160;mV and long&#8208;term stability of 200 h at 100 mA cm&#8722;2, exceeding commercial 40% Pt/C and most reported Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Its mass activity is 2.7 times higher than that of 40% Pt/C with an overpotential of 100 mV. Furthermore, at industrial temperature (65&#160;&#176;C), the electrolyzer based on Pt@S&#8211;NiFe LDH needs just 1.62 V to reach the current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, superior to that of the commercial one of 40% Pt/C//IrO2. This work provides rational ideas to develop electrocatalysts with exceptional performance for industrial high&#8208;temperature water splitting at high current densities.

         <title>Plasmonic Dual&#8208;Gap Nanodumbbells for Label&#8208;Free On&#8208;Particle Raman DNA Assays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Au dual&#8208;gap nanodumbbell (AuDGN) structures are designed, synthesized, and analyzed wherein uniform and controllable dual gaps [inter&#8208;head (between dumbbell heads) and intra&#8208;head gaps (inside dumbbell heads)] with strong and tunable electromagnetic field exist. Target DNA can directly diffuse into these externally exposed nanogaps of AuDGNs for label&#8208;free molecular fingerprint surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering sensing of varying DNA sequences.








Abstract
Metal nanostructures with a tunable plasmonic gap are useful for photonics, surface&#8208;enhanced spectroscopy, biosensing, and bioimaging applications. The use of these structures as chemical and biological sensing/imaging probes typically requires an ultra&#8208;precise synthesis of the targeted nanostructure in a high yield,&#160;with Raman dye&#8208;labeling and complex assay components and procedures. Here, a plasmonic nanostructure with tunable dual nanogaps, Au dual&#8208;gap nanodumbbells (AuDGNs), is designed and synthesized&#160;via the anisotropic adsorption of polyethyleneimine on Au nanorods to facilitate tip&#8208;selective Au growths on nanorod tips for forming mushroom&#8208;shaped dumbbell&#8208;head structures at both tips and results in dual gaps (intra&#8208;head and inter&#8208;head gaps) within a single particle. AuDGNs are synthesized in a high yield (&gt;90%) while controlling the inter&#8208;head gap size, and the average surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) enhancement factor (EF) value is 7.5&#160;&#215;&#160;108 with a very narrow EF distribution from 1.5&#160;&#215;&#160;108 to 1.5&#160;&#215;&#160;109 for &gt;90% of analyzed particles. Importantly, AuDGNs enable label&#8208;free on&#8208;particle SERS detection assays through the diffusion of target molecules into the intraparticle gap for different DNA sequences with varying ATGC combinations in a highly specific and sensitive manner without a need for Raman dyes.

Halogenated propeller&#8208;shaped ammonium is synthesized and applied to reduce the surface energy and prompt the formation of the &#945;&#8208;phase CsxFA1&#8722;xPbI3 perovskite structure, which generates a record efficiency of 23.6% for CsxFA1&#8722;xPbI3&#8208;based inverted structural perovskite solar cells with excellent stability.








Abstract
Methylammonium (MA)&#8208;free formamidinium (FA)&#8208;dominated CsxFA1&#8722;xPbI3 is rising as the most promising candidate for highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells. However, the growth of high&#8208;quality CsxFA1&#8722;xPbI3 black&#8208;phase perovskite structure without ion doping in the lattice remains a challenge. Herein, propeller&#8208;shaped halogenated tertiary ammonium is synthesized, showing high binding energy on the perovskite surface and large steric hindrance. This molecule can significantly reduce the barrier of high surface energy that suppresses the growth of the &#945;&#8208;phase CsxFA1&#8722;xPbI3 structure. As a result, the &#945;&#8208;phase structure can be formed at room temperature, which can further act as a seed for the growth of high&#8208;quality film. Solar cells based on the film show a record efficiency up to 23.6% for MA free CsxFA1&#8722;xPbI3 solar cells with inverted structure and excellent stability at 85&#160;&#176;C over 200&#160;h.

         <title>Dynamically Interfacial pH&#8208;Buffering Effect Enabled by N&#8208;Methylimidazole Molecules as Spontaneous Proton Pumps toward Highly Reversible Zinc&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamically interfacial pH&#8208;buffering strategy implemented by N&#8208;methylimidazole (NMI) which acts as a spontaneous proton pump, is proposed to remove the detrimental OH&#8722; at zinc/electrolyte interface in real&#8208;time. An in situ interfacial pH detection method with micro&#8208;sized spatial resolution based on the ultra&#8208;microelectrode technology is developed to probe pH evolution in the diffusion layer.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries have attracted extensive attention due to their outstanding merits of high safety and low cost. However, the intrinsic thermodynamic instability of zinc in aqueous electrolyte inevitably results in hydrogen evolution, and the consequent generation of OH&#8722; at the interface will dramatically exacerbate the formation of dead zinc and dendrites. Herein, a dynamically interfacial pH&#8208;buffering strategy implemented by N&#8208;methylimidazole (NMI) additive is proposed to remove the detrimental OH&#8722; at zinc/electrolyte interface in real&#8208;time, thus eliminating the accumulation of by&#8208;products fundamentally. Electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance and molecular dynamics simulation results reveal the existence of an interfacial absorption layer assembled by NMI and protonated NMI (NMIH+), which acts as an ion pump for replenishing the interface with protons constantly. Moreover, an in situ interfacial pH detection method with micro&#8208;sized spatial resolution based on the ultra&#8208;microelectrode technology is developed to probe the pH evolution in diffusion layer, confirming the stabilized interfacial chemical environment in NMI&#8208;containing electrolyte. Accordingly, with the existence of NMI, an excellent cumulative plating capacity of 4.2 Ah cm&#8722;2 and ultrahigh Coulombic efficiency of 99.74% are realized for zinc electrodes. Meanwhile, the NMI/NMIH+ buffer additive can accelerate the dissolution/deposition process of MnO2/Mn2+ on the cathode, leading to enhanced cycling capacity.

         <title>Heteroepitaxial Control of Fermi Liquid, Hund Metal, and Mott Insulator Phases in Single&#8208;Atomic&#8208;Layer Ruthenates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interface control of electronic structure in single&#8208;atomic&#8208;layer ruthenates is demonstrated. Combining thin film epitaxy and photoemission spectroscopy, a method to study interfacial electronic phases of ultrathin heterostructures is developed. Fermi liquid, Hund metal, and Mott insulator phases of SrRuO3 are discovered, exclusively in the single&#8208;atomic&#8208;layer limit. This work suggests a general way to investigate ultrathin interfacial electronic systems.








Abstract
Interfaces between dissimilar correlated oxides can offer devices with versatile functionalities, and great efforts have been made to manipulate interfacial electronic phases. However, realizing such phases is often hampered by the inability to directly access the electronic structure information; most correlated interfacial phenomena appear within a few atomic layers from the interface. Here, atomic&#8208;scale epitaxy and photoemission spectroscopy are utilized to realize the interface control of correlated electronic phases in atomic&#8208;scale ruthenate&#8211;titanate heterostructures. While bulk SrRuO3 is a ferromagnetic metal, the heterointerfaces exclusively generate three distinct correlated phases in the single&#8208;atomic&#8208;layer limit. The theoretical analysis reveals that atomic&#8208;scale structural proximity effects yield Fermi liquid, Hund metal, and Mott insulator phases in the quantum&#8208;confined SrRuO3. These results highlight the extensive interfacial tunability of electronic phases, hitherto hidden in the atomically thin correlated heterostructure. Moreover, this experimental platform suggests a way to control interfacial electronic phases of various correlated materials.

         <title>A Polymorphic Memtransistor with Tunable Metallic and Semiconducting Channel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymorphic memtransistor based on atomically thin Mo0.91W0.09Te2 is achieved, where the lateral device channel can be tuned as metallic and semiconducting for diverse neuromorphic and in&#8208;memory computing.








Abstract
Modulating semiconducting channel potential has been used for electrical switching in transistors without biological plasticity operations that are critical for energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic computing. To achieve efficient data processing, alternative transport mechanisms, such as tunneling and thermionic emission, have been introduced with 2D materials. Here, a polymorphic memtransistor based on atomically thin Mo0.91W0.09Te2 is presented, where the lattice and electronic structures of the lateral device channel can be tuned as either metallic (1T&#8242;) or semiconducting (2H) phases by electrical gating. The structural and electronic phase change of the channel material, optimized in Mo0.91W0.09Te2, is explored using transport and optical measurements at the device scale. Based on the phase transition, the polymorphic memtransistor demonstrates a high on/off ratio (up to 105), low subthreshold swing (down to 80&#160;mV dec&#8722;1), and various memristive behaviors, which are distinguished from traditional phase&#8208;change memory, transistors, and passive memristors for diverse neuromorphic and in&#8208;memory computing.

         <title>Encapsulating High&#8208;Temperature Superconducting Twisted van der Waals Heterostructures Blocks Detrimental Effects of Disorder</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method of fabricating high&#8208;temperature&#8208;superconductor&#8208;based van der Waals heterostructures is reported. The novel method utilizing the encapsulating heterostructure's interface overcomes detrimental effects of disorder and enables crucial improvement of the characteristics of the Josephson junction constituting the core of the proposed van der Waals material. The designed heterostructures operating at elevated temperatures holds potential for emerging quantum technologies.








Abstract
High&#8208;temperature cuprate superconductors based van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures hold high technological promise. One of the obstacles hindering their progress is the detrimental effect of disorder on the properties of the vdW&#8208;devices&#8208;based Josephson junctions (JJs). Here, a new method of fabricating twisted vdW heterostructures made of Bi2Sr2CuCa2O8+&#948;, crucially improving the JJ characteristics and pushing them up to those of the intrinsic JJs in bulk samples, is reported. The method combines cryogenic stacking using a solvent&#8208;free stencil mask technique and covering the interface by insulating hexagonal boron nitride crystals. Despite the high&#8208;vacuum condition down to 10&#8722;6 mbar in the evaporation chamber, the interface appears to be protected from water molecules during the in situ metal deposition only when fully encapsulated. Comparing the current&#8211;voltage curves of encapsulated and unencapsulated interfaces, it is revealed that the encapsulated interfaces&#8217; characteristics are crucially improved, so that the corresponding JJs demonstrate high critical currents and sharpness of the superconducting transition comparable to those of the intrinsic JJs. Finally, it is shown that the encapsulated heterostructures are more stable over&#160;time.

         <title>An Active Pixel&#8208;Matrix Electrocaloric Device for Targeted and Differential Thermal Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient pixel&#8208;matrix electrocaloric (EC) cooling device is demonstrated on which each refrigeration pixel can be independently controlled and can effectively cool down the localized overheating on microelectronics in situ as needed. All active pixels in the EC cooling device exhibit a stable temperature span of 4.6 K and a heat flux of 62&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8208;1.








Abstract
More than 55% of electronic failures are caused by damage from localized overheating. Up to now, there is still no efficient method for targeted temperature control against localized overheating. Although some existing thermal management devices handle this issue by full coverage cooling, it generates a lot of useless energy consumption. Here, a highly efficient pixel&#8208;matrix electrocaloric (EC) cooling device is reported, which can realize a targeted and differential thermal management. The modified poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;tertrifluoroethylene&#8208;chlorofluoroethylene) reaches a large adiabatic temperature change of 7.8 K and is more suitable for thermal transfer and electrostatic actuation at high frequencies. All active pixels in the EC cooling device exhibit a stable temperature span of 4.6 K and a heat flux of 62&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8208;2, which is more than twice that of the one&#8208;layer EC device. Each refrigeration pixel can be independently controlled and effectively cooled down the localized overheating site(s) in situ. The surface temperature of the simulated central processing unit decreases by 33.2 K at 120 s after applying this EC device. Such a compact, embeddable, low cost, and active solid&#8208;state pixel&#8208;matrix cooling device has great potential for localized overheating protection in microelectronics.

         <title>Embedded 3D Printing of Architected Ceramics via Microwave&#8208;Activated Polymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microwave&#8208;activated, embedded 3D printing (EMB3D) method is developed to create complex ceramic lattices and interpenetrating architectures with tailored composition, density, and mechanical properties.








Abstract
Light&#8208; and ink&#8208;based 3D printing methods have vastly expanded the design space and geometric complexity of architected ceramics. However, light&#8208;based methods are typically confined to a relatively narrow range of preceramic and particle&#8208;laden resins, while ink&#8208;based methods are limited in geometric complexity due to layerwise assembly. Here, embedded 3D printing is combined with microwave&#8208;activated curing to generate architected ceramics with spatially controlled composition in freeform shapes. Aqueous colloidal inks are printed within a support matrix, rapidly cured via microwave&#8208;activated polymerization, and subsequently dried and sintered into dense architectures composed of one or more oxide materials. This&#160;integrated manufacturing method opens new avenues for the design and fabrication of complex ceramic architectures with programmed composition, density, and form for myriad applications.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Synthesis of &#63743;P&#63742;N&#8208;Doped Carbon Nanofibers for Single&#8208;Atom Catalytic Hydrosilylation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidone (NMP) as the carbon source, &#63743;P&#63742;N&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers can be synthesized by NMP&#8211;P2O5 interaction, serving as a superior support to build the single&#8208;atom catalyst for hydrosilylation. Since NMP itself is an outstanding solvent, it is possible to regulate the structure of the carbon nanofibers by dissolving other chemicals/materials.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts have become a popular choice in various catalysis applications, as they take advantages of both homogeneous catalysis (e.g., high efficiency) and heterogeneous catalysis (e.g., easy catalyst recovery). The atom support plays an indispensable role in anchoring atomic species and interplaying with them for ultimate catalytic performance. Therefore, development of new support materials for superior catalysis is of great importance. Here the synthesis of carbon nanofibers based on the reaction between phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) and N&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidone (NMP) is reported. The underlying reaction process is systematically investigated by Fourier&#8208;transform infrared&#160;(FTIR) spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The carbon nanofibers have interesting &#63743;P&#63742;N&#63743; units in their chemical structure, which act as anchoring sites for the single&#8208;atom catalyst. The Pt atoms anchoring carbon nanofibers exhibit high activity for hydrosilylation with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 9.2&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;h&#8722;1 and a selectivity of &gt;99%. This research affords not only a new in situ chemical strategy to synthesize multiatom doped carbon nanofibers but also presents a potential superior support in catalysis, which opens a hopeful window in materials chemistry and catalysis applications.

         <title>Extremely Robust and Multifunctional Nanocomposite Fibers for Strain&#8208;Unperturbed Textile Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extremely robust and multifunctional nanocomposite fiber is fabricated by introducing a mechanically interlocked network inside the fibrous structure. The fiber obtains strong resistance against structural crack formation and propagation, and the fiber&#8208;based textile electronics show exceptional robustness. The textile&#8208;based electromechanical sensors exhibited strain&#8208;unalterable sensing performance and fiber&#8208;shaped supercapacitors showed invariant electrochemical performance during large and cyclic strain perturbations.








Abstract
Textile electronics are needed that can achieve strain&#8208;unaltered performance when they undergo irregular and repeated strain deformation. Such strain&#8208;unaltered textile electronics require advanced fibers that simultaneously have high functionalities and extreme robustness as fabric materials. Current synthetic nanocomposite fibers based on inorganic matrix have remarkable functionalities but often suffer from low robustness and poor tolerance against crack formation. Here,&#160;we&#160;present a design for a high&#8208;performance multifunctional nanocomposite fiber that is mechanically and electrically robust, which&#160;was&#160;realized by crosslinking titanium carbide (MXene) nanosheets with a slide&#8208;ring polyrotaxane to form an internal mechanically&#8208;interlocked network. This inorganic matrix nanocomposite fiber featured distinct strain&#8208;hardening mechanical behavior and exceptional load&#8208;bearing capability (toughness approaching 60 MJ m&#8722;3 and ductility over 27%). It retained 100% of its ductility after cyclic strain loading. Moreover, the high electrical conductivity (&gt;1.1 &#215; 105 S m&#8722;1) and electrochemical performance (&gt;360 F cm&#8722;3) of the nanocomposite fiber can be well retained after subjecting the fiber to extensive (&gt;25% strain) and long&#8208;term repeated (10&#8201;000 cycles) dimensional changes. Such superior robustness allowed for the fabrication of the nanocomposite fibers into various robust wearable devices, such as textile&#8208;based electromechanical sensors with strain&#8208;unalterable sensing performance and fiber&#8208;shaped supercapacitors with invariant electrochemical performance for 10&#8201;000 strain loading cycles.

         <title>Unsaturated, Trialkyl Ionizable Lipids are Versatile Lipid&#8208;Nanoparticle Components for Therapeutic and Vaccine Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through rational design and structure&#8211;activity relationship analysis, a library of 16 novel ionizable lipids that use trialkyl structural motifs is screened. A potent trialkyl lipid (&#8220;Lipid 10&#8221;) that demonstrates broad spectrum activity in both therapeutic and vaccine applications is identified. In many cases, it outperforms the leading ionizable lipid benchmarks used in Onpattro, SpikeVax, and Comirnaty.








Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have proven a successful platform for the delivery of nucleic acid (NA)&#8208;based therapeutics and vaccines, with the ionizable lipid component playing a key role in modulating potency and tolerability. Here, a library of 16 novel ionizable lipids is screened hypothesizing that short, branched trialkyl hydrophobic domains can improve LNP fusogenicity or endosomal escape, and potency. LNPs formulated with the top&#8208;performing trialkyl lipid (Lipid 10) encapsulating transthyretin siRNA elicit significantly greater gene silencing and are better tolerated than those with the benchmark Onpattro lipid DLin&#8208;MC3&#8208;DMA. Lipid 10 also demonstrates superior liver delivery of mRNA when compared to other literature ionizable lipids, is well tolerated, and successfully repeat&#8208;doses in nonhuman primates. In a prime&#8208;boost hemagglutinin rodent vaccine model, intramuscular administration of Lipid&#8208;10 LNP elicits comparable or better antibody titers to the SM&#8208;102 and ALC&#8208;0315 lipid compositions used in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved mRNA COVID vaccines. These data suggest that Lipid 10 is a particularly versatile ionizable lipid, well&#8208;suited for both systemic therapeutic and intramuscular vaccine applications and able to successfully deliver diverse NA payloads.

     alt="Unsaturated, Trialkyl Ionizable Lipids are Versatile Lipid-Nanoparticle Components for Therapeutic and Vaccine Applications"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through rational design and structure&#8211;activity relationship analysis, a library of 16 novel ionizable lipids that use trialkyl structural motifs is screened. A potent trialkyl lipid (&#8220;Lipid 10&#8221;) that demonstrates broad spectrum activity in both therapeutic and vaccine applications is identified. In many cases, it outperforms the leading ionizable lipid benchmarks used in Onpattro, SpikeVax, and Comirnaty.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have proven a successful platform for the delivery of nucleic acid (NA)-based therapeutics and vaccines, with the ionizable lipid component playing a key role in modulating potency and tolerability. Here, a library of 16 novel ionizable lipids is screened hypothesizing that short, branched trialkyl hydrophobic domains can improve LNP fusogenicity or endosomal escape, and potency. LNPs formulated with the top-performing trialkyl lipid (Lipid 10) encapsulating transthyretin siRNA elicit significantly greater gene silencing and are better tolerated than those with the benchmark Onpattro lipid DLin-MC3-DMA. Lipid 10 also demonstrates superior liver delivery of mRNA when compared to other literature ionizable lipids, is well tolerated, and successfully repeat-doses in nonhuman primates. In a prime-boost hemagglutinin rodent vaccine model, intramuscular administration of Lipid-10 LNP elicits comparable or better antibody titers to the SM-102 and ALC-0315 lipid compositions used in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved mRNA COVID vaccines. These data suggest that Lipid 10 is a particularly versatile ionizable lipid, well-suited for both systemic therapeutic and intramuscular vaccine applications and able to successfully deliver diverse NA payloads.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Facile and Rational Method to Tailor the Symmetry of Au@Ag Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and rational method to tailor the symmetry of Au@Ag nanoparticles is reported. By introducing l&#8208;cysteine into the growth system, truncated cuboids/octahedra, well&#8208;defined octahedra, and tetrahedra can be readily obtained with the increase of Ag precursor concentration. Among them, the truncated cuboids/octahedra are chiral, and their formation can be seen as a result of dissymmetric synthesis.








Abstract
Precisely controlling the morphologies of plasmonic metal nanoparticles (NPs) is of great importance for many applications. Here, a facile seed&#8208;mediated growth method is demonstrated that tailors the morphologies of Au@Ag NPs from cubes/cuboids to chiral truncated cuboids/octahedra, well&#8208;defined octahedra, and tetrahedra, via simply increasing the concentrations of AgNO3&#160;and cysteine in the halide surfactant systems. Accordingly, the particle symmetries are also tuned. The method is quite robust where seeds with distinct shapes including irregular ones can all lead to uniform Au@Ag NPs. The evolution of these shapes can be illustrated by a recently proposed symmetry&#8208;based kinematic theory (SBKT). Furthermore, SBKT shows a strategy to optimize the preparation of chiral/dissymmetric NPs, and the experimental results confirm such a dissymmetric synthesis strategy. Cuboids and octahedra with corners differently truncated are identified as two different chiral forms. The chirality of the NPs is additionally probed by electrochemistry, where the chiral NPs show enantioselectivity in the oxidation of d&#8208; and l&#8208;glucose. Altogether, the results gain fundamental insights into tailoring the plasmonic NP morphologies, and also suggest strategies to obtain chiral NPs.

         <title>In Situ Generation of Red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR Emissive Radical Cations in the Stomach for Gastrointestinal Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Red&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared&#160;(NIR) fluorescent probes are promising for gastrointestinal disease studies with the advantages of deep penetration and high sensitivity. However, conventional fluorophores feature electron closed&#8208;shell structures and require tedious procedures for preparation. Herein, it is found that red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR emissive and stable pyrrole radical cations can be quickly generated in situ in an acidic stomach after gavage with simple pyrroles, which can be used for gastrointestinal imaging with high spatiotemporal resolution and anti&#8208;gastric&#8208;acid therapy assessment with excellent sensitivity.








Abstract
Red&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent probes, with advantages such as high spatiotemporal resolution and in situ sensing abilities,&#160;are highly attractive for diagnosis of gastrointestinal diseases and targeted drug development. However, conventional red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR fluorophores with electron closed&#8208;shell structures require tedious synthetic procedures for preparation, and it is difficult to further decorate them with sensing groups. In this study, a series of easily prepared pyrroles with simple structures that can quickly be transformed into red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR emissive radical cations in acidic buffer solution and in vivo stomachs is developed. The in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR emissive pyrrole radical cations in the stomach have excellent biocompatibility and stability and can be used not only for intravital gastrointestinal imaging with high spatiotemporal resolution, but also for dynamic monitoring of the gastric emptying process and assessment of anti&#8208;gastric&#8208;acid therapy. The acidity&#8208;induced generation of pyrrole radical cations is believed to provide a facile strategy for developing red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR fluorophores and studying gastrointestinal diseases.

         <title>Mass Production of Sulfur&#8208;Tuned Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Zn&#8211;Air Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) with highly active M&#63743;N4&#63743;S sites is successfully fabricated in a sustainable and large&#8208;scale manner by utilizing a by&#8208;product of the papermaking industry (i.e., lignosulfonate) as a multifunctional bioligand. The resulting SAC exhibits enhanced oxygen reduction and evolution reactions catalytic performance and shows high durability in Zn&#8211;air batteries.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) show great potential for rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries (ZABs); however, scalable production of SACs from sustainable resources is difficult owing to poor control of the local coordination environment. Herein, lignosulfonate, a by&#8208;product of the papermaking industry, is utilized as a multifunctional bioligand for the mass production of SACs with highly active M&#63743;N4&#63743;S sites (M represents Fe, Cu, and Co) via strong metal&#63743;nitrogen/sulfur coordination. This effectively adjusts the charge distribution and promotes the catalytic performance, leading to highly durable and excellent performance in oxygen reduction and evolution reactions for ZABs. This study paves the way for the industrial production of cost&#8208;effective SACs in a sustainable manner.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Electrochemical Glycerol Conversion over a Mie Scattering Effect Enhanced Porous BiVO4 Photoanode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Mie scattering porous BiVO4 photoanode transformed from the well&#8208;documented porous BiVO4 photoanode by a facile annealing treatment in the air decreases the reflection of incident light and enables the reabsorbed ability of scattered light, leading to pronounced light&#8208;harvesting efficiency enhancement, which delivers a high dihydroxyacetone conversion rate of 325.2 mmol m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 from photo&#8208;electrochemical glycerol oxidation.








Abstract
The photo&#8208;electrochemical (PEC) oxidation of glycerol (GLY) to high&#8208;value&#8208;added dihydroxyacetone (DHA) can be achieved over a BiVO4 photoanode, while the PEC performance of most BiVO4 photoanodes is impeded due to the upper limits of the photocurrent density. Here, an enhanced Mie scattering effect of the well&#8208;documented porous BiVO4 photoanode is obtained with less effort by a simple annealing process, which significantly reduces the reflectivity to near zero. The great light absorbability increases the basic photocurrent density by 1.77 times. The selective oxidation of GLY over the BiVO4 photoanode results in a photocurrent density of 6.04 mA cm&#8722;2 and a DHA production rate of 325.2 mmol m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 that exceeds all reported values. This work addresses the poor ability of nanostructured BiVO4 to harvest light, paving the way for further improvements in charge transport and transfer to realize highly efficient PEC conversion.

         <title>Dramatically Accelerated Formation of Graphite Intercalation Compounds Catalyzed by Sodium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pellets of graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) are synthesized by the Na&#8208;catalyzed method. AM&#8211;GICs (AM&#160;= Li, Na, K) are formed simply by mixing AM and graphite with Na at room temperature. A&#160;Ca&#8208;GIC&#160;(CaC6) is formed&#160;by heating a mixture of Ca, graphite, and Na at 250 &#176;C for only several hours.








Abstract
Graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) have a variety of functions due to their rich material variations, and thus, innovative methods for their synthesis are desired for practical applications. It is discovered that Na has a catalytic property that dramatically accelerates the formation of GICs. It is demonstrated that LiC6n (n&#160;= 1, 2), KC8, KC12n (n&#160;= 2, 3, 4), and NaCx are synthesized simply by mixing alkali metals and graphite powder with Na at room temperature (&#8776;25&#160;&#176;C), and AEC6 (AE&#160;= Ca, Sr, Ba) are synthesized by heating Na&#8208;added reagents at 250&#160;&#176;C only for a few hours. The NaCx, formed by the mixing of C and Na, is understood to act as a reaction intermediate for a catalyst, thereby accelerating the formation of GICs by lowering the activation energy of intercalation. The Na&#8208;catalyzed method, which enables the rapid and mass synthesis of homogeneous GIC samples in a significantly simpler manner than conventional methods, is anticipated to stimulate research and development for GIC applications.

         <title>Nonlocal Cable&#8208;Network Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;plug&#8208;and&#8208;play&#8221; reconfigurable metamaterial platform based on standard coaxial cables and bayonet Neill&#8211;Concelman (BNC) connectors is proposed. Particularly, interesting nonlocal effects can be straightforwardly implemented through coupling unit cells via coaxial cables to their beyond nearest neighbors. Metamaterials with nonlocal interactions from 2nd order to 6th order are assembled and highly unusual dispersion relations than with only local interactions are experimentally demonstrated.








Abstract
Metamaterials are artificial materials in which the atoms of ordinary solids are replaced by tailored functional building blocks. Therefore, previous work has emphasized tailoring the inside of the building blocks, for example, by exploiting local resonances, to realize unusual effective metamaterial properties. However, the wave properties of a metamaterial are not only determined by its building blocks but also by the interactions between these building blocks. Here, reconfigurable &#8220;plug&#8208;and&#8208;play&#8221; electromagnetic metamaterials are introduced for which the building blocks are essentially trivial standard bayonet Neill&#8211;Concelman (BNC) connectors and the effective metamaterial properties are solely achieved by tailoring the local and especially the nonlocal interactions mediated by standard coaxial cables. Unprecedented dispersion relations of the lowest band with multiple regions of slow waves and backward waves are demonstrated. Importantly, the dispersion relation of such metamaterials dominated by nonlocal interactions is not limited by the principle of causality in the same way as for metamaterials designed by local resonances of building blocks.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Induced Transient Self&#8208;Organization of TiNx Nano&#8208;Filament Percolated Networks for High Performance Surface&#8208;Mountable Filter Capacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Preparing low&#8208;dimensional conductive nitride&#8208;based hierarchical structures with sub&#8208;10 nm geometric characteristics has been a major challenge. A unique laser&#8208;induced transient self&#8208;organization strategy to rapidly and controllably fabricate ultrafine (diameter: 3&#8211;5 nm) TiNx nano&#8208;filament percolated chaotic fractal networks is presented. The prepared surface&#8208;mountable filter capacitors achieve a record&#8208;breaking volumetric energy density of 9.17 mWh cm&#8722;3 at 120 Hz in an aqueous electrolyte.








Abstract
Filter capacitors (FCs) are substantial for digital circuits and microelectronic devices, and thus more compact FCs are eternally demanded for system miniaturization. Even though microsupercapacitors are broadly regarded as an excellent candidate for future FCs, yet due to the limitation of available electrode materials, the capacitive performance of reported MSCs drops sharply under high&#8208;frequency alternating current. Herein, we&#160;present a unique laser&#8208;induced transient self&#8208;organization strategy, which synergizes pulsed laser energy and multi&#8208;physical field controlled coalescence processes, leading to the rapid and controllable preparation of titanium nitride ultrafine nano&#8208;filaments (diameter &#8776;3&#8211;5 nm) networks. Their chaotic fractal nanoporous structure, superior specific surface area, and excellent conductivity render these nanostructures promising candidates for FCs. Surface&#8208;mounted filter capacitors based on this electrode material exhibit ultra&#8208;long cycle&#8208;life (2 000 000 cycles) with record ultrahigh volumetric energy density of 9.17 mWh cm&#8722;3 at 120 Hz in aqueous electrolyte, displaying advantages in function, size, and integrability compared with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art aluminum electrolytic capacitors. The method here provides a versatile toolbox for designing novel nanostructures with intriguing characteristics and insights for developing advanced and miniaturized filter and power devices.

A multifunctional therapeutic immune&#8208;nanomedicine, MOF&#8208;CpG&#8208;DMXAA, effectively delivers cytosine&#8211;phosphate&#8211;guanine oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODNs) and 5,6&#8208;dimethylxanthenone&#8208;4&#8208;acetic acid (DMXAA) to improve the miserable immune response by reprogramming tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs), promoting dendritic cells&#160;(DCs) maturation and inhibiting angiogenesis, achieving synergistically immunotherapy. MOF&#8208;CpG&#8208;DMXAA significantly enhances stimulator of interferon genes (STING) activation, reverses the immunosuppression state and stimulates robust tumoricidal immunity, exhibiting a synergistic efficiency to eradicate hepatocellular carcinoma.








Abstract
Immunotherapy has achieved revolutionary success in clinics, but it remains challenging for treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) characterized by high vascularization. Here, it is reported that metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;801 (MOF&#8208;801) can be employed as a stimulator of interferon genes (STING) through Toll&#8208;like receptor 4 (TLR4) not just as a drug delivery carrier. Notably, cytosine&#8211;phosphate&#8211;guanine oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODNs) and 5, 6&#8208;dimethylxanthenone&#8208;4&#8208;acetic acid (DMXAA) STING agonist with vascular disrupting function coordinates with MOF&#8208;801 to self&#8208;assemble into a nanoparticle (MOF&#8208;CpG&#8208;DMXAA) that effectively delivers CpG ODNs and DMXAA to cells for synergistically improving the tumor microenvironment by reprogramming tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs), promoting dendritic cells (DCs) maturation, as well as destroying tumor blood vessels. In HCC&#8208;bearing mouse models, it is demonstrated that MOF&#8208;CpG&#8208;DMXAA triggers systemic immune activation and stimulates robust tumoricidal immunity, resulting in a superior immunotherapeutic efficiency in orthotopic and recurrent HCC.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na/K plating&#8211;stripping behaviors in carbon hosts with mesochannels that enable superfast mass transport are systematically studied by in situ transmission electron microscopy. These mesochannels can remarkably increase the accessible surface area, thus boosting the surface ion diffusion, and then becoming the superfast channels for Na/K transport via interfacial diffusion. Such pore&#8208;modified hosts enable dendrite&#8208;free sodium deposition and superior high&#8208;rate performance.








Abstract
Fast ion diffusion in anode hosts enabling uniform distribution of Li/Na/K is essential for achieving dendrite&#8208;free alkali&#8208;metal batteries. Common strategies, e.g. expanding the interlayer spacing of anode materials, can enhance bulk diffusion of Li but are less efficient for Na and K due to their larger ionic radius. Herein, a universal strategy to drastically improve the mass&#8208;transport efficiency of Na/K by introducing open mesochannels in carbon hosts is proposed. Such pore engineering can increase the accessible surface area by one order of magnitude, thus remarkably accelerating surface diffusion, as visualized by in situ transmission electron microscopy. In particular, once the mesochannels are filled by the&#160;Na/K metals, they become the superfast channels for mass transport via the mechanism of interfacial diffusion. Thus&#8208;modified carbon hosts enable Na/K filling in their inner cavities and uniform deposition across the whole electrodes with fast kinetics. The resulting Na&#8208;metal anodes can exhibit stable dendrite&#8208;free cycling with outstanding rate performance at a high current density of up to 30&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This work presents an inspiring attempt to address the sluggish transport issue of Na/K, as well as valuable insights into the mass&#8208;transport mechanism in porous anodes for high&#8208;performance alkali&#8208;metal storage.

         <title>Nanoimprinted 2D&#8208;Chiral Perovskite Nanocrystal Metasurfaces for Circularly Polarized Photoluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unmodified CsPbBr3 and CsPbBr1I2 perovskite nanocrystals exhibit intense circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) reaching glum values up to 0.15 and 0.3 (with a high index coating) when they are nanostructured into 2D chiral metasurfaces using soft nanoimprinting lithography. The approach is scalable and leads to large areas enabling CPL production from a variety of nanoemitters.








Abstract
The versatile hybrid perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) are one of the most promising materials for optoelectronics by virtue of their tunable bandgaps and high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields. However, their inherent crystalline chemical structure limits the chiroptical properties achievable with the material. The production of chiral perovskites has become an active field of research for its promising applications in optics, chemistry, or biology. Typically, chiral halide perovskites are obtained by the incorporation of different chiral moieties in the material. Unfortunately, these chemically modified perovskites have demonstrated moderate values of chiral PL so far. Here, a general and scalable approach is introduced to produce chiral PL from arbitrary nanoemitters assembled into 2D&#8208;chiral metasurfaces. The fabrication via nanoimprinting lithography employs elastomeric molds engraved with chiral motifs covering millimeter areas that are used to pattern two types of unmodified colloidal perovskite NC inks: green&#8208;emissive CsPbBr3 and red&#8208;emissive CsPbBr1I2. The perovskite 2D&#8208;metasurfaces exhibit remarkable PL dissymmetry factors (glum) of 0.16 that can be further improved up to glum of 0.3 by adding a high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index coating on the metasurfaces. This scalable approach to produce chiral photoluminescent thin films paves the way for the seamless production of bright chiral light sources for upcoming optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Synaptic Resistor Circuits Based on Al Oxide and Ti Silicide for Concurrent Learning and Signal Processing in Artificial Intelligence Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synaptic resistor (synstor) circuit concurrently executes signal processing and learning in real time to fly drones toward a target in an aerodynamically changing environment faster than human controllers, and with learning speed, performance, power consumption, and adaptability to the environment significantly superior to an artificial neural network on computers, providing a path to establish power&#8208;efficient intelligent systems in the capriciously mutable real world.








Abstract
Neurobiological circuits containing synapses can process signals while learning concurrently in real time. Before an artificial neural network (ANN) can execute a signal&#8208;processing program, it must first be programmed by humans or trained with respect to a large and defined data set during learning processes, resulting in significant latency, high power consumption, and poor adaptability to unpredictable changing environments. In&#160;this&#160;work, a crossbar circuit of synaptic resistors (synstors) is reported, each synstor integrating a Si channel with an Al oxide memory layer and Ti silicide Schottky contacts. Individual synstors are characterized and analyzed to understand their concurrent signal&#8208;processing and learning abilities. Without any prior training, synstor circuits concurrently execute signal processing and learning in real time to fly drones toward a target position in an aerodynamically changing environment faster than human controllers, and with learning speed, performance, power consumption, and adaptability to the environment significantly superior to an ANN running on computers. The synstor circuit provides a path to establish power&#8208;efficient intelligent systems with real&#8208;time learning and adaptability in the capriciously mutable real world.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Assisted Wet Annealing: A New Strategy for Superstrong, Tough, Stretchable, and Anti&#8208;Fatigue Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel solvent&#8208;exchange&#8208;assisted wet&#8208;annealing strategy is first proposed to develop superstrong and tough hydrogels with extremely high stretchability and excellent fatigue resistance. The hydrogels have extremely high tensile strength of 11.19 &#177; 0.27 MPa, a fracture toughness of 82.28 &#177; 2.89 MJ m&#8722;3 with stretchability up to 1879 &#177; 10%, and a fatigue threshold of &#8776;1233 J m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Hydrogels are widely used in tissue engineering, soft robots, wearable electronics, etc. However, it remains a great challenge to develop hydrogels possessing simultaneously high strength, large stretchability, great fracture energy, and good fatigue threshold to suit different applications. Herein, a novel solvent&#8208;exchange&#8208;assisted wet&#8208;annealing strategy is proposed to prepare high performance poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogels by extensively tuning the macromolecular chain movement and optimizing the polymer network. The reinforcing and toughening mechanisms are found to be &#8220;macromolecule crystallization and entanglement&#8221;. These hydrogels have large tensile strengths up to 11.19 &#177; 0.27&#160;MPa and extremely high fracture strains of 1879 &#177; 10%. In addition, the fracture energy and fatigue threshold can reach as high as 25.39 &#177; 6.64&#160;kJ m&#8722;2 and &#8776;1233 J m&#8722;2, respectively. These superb mechanical properties compare favorably to those of other tough hydrogels, organogels, and even natural tendons and synthetic rubbers. This work provides a new and effective method to fabricate superstrong, tough, stretchable, and anti&#8208;fatigue hydrogels with potential applications in artificial tendons and ligaments.

         <title>Electronic State and Microenvironment Modulation of Metal Nanoparticles Stabilized by MOFs for Boosting Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction</title>

Tiny PdCu nanoparticles are encapsulated into a representative metal&#8208;organic framework, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;SO3H, followed by post&#8208;synthetic coating of the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer to afford PdCu@UiO&#8208;S@PDMS composite. Strikingly, the protonated and hydrophobic microenvironment&#160;and electron&#8208;rich PdCu sites endow PdCu@UiO&#8208;S@PDMS with high activity toward the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (Faraday efficiency: 13.16%, yield: 20.24&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1), far superior to the corresponding counterparts.








Abstract
Modulation of the local electronic structure and microenvironment of catalytic metal sites plays a critical role in electrocatalysis, yet remains a grand challenge.

         <title>Planted Graphene Quantum Dots for Targeted, Enhanced Tumor Imaging and Long&#8208;Term Visualization of Local Pharmacokinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) are in situ planted in a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) layer of PEGylated nanoparticles from small&#8208;molecule pyrene. After accessible specificity modification, the multifunctional NPs&#8208;GQDs&#8208;PEG provides targeted, multimodal molecular imaging for various tumor models in vitro or in vivo. Moreover, the highly photostable GQDs enable long&#8208;term, real&#8208;time visualization of the local pharmacokinetics of NPs in vivo.








Abstract
While photoluminescent graphene quantum dots (GQDs) have long been considered very suitable for bioimaging owing to their protein&#8208;like size, superhigh photostability and in vivo long&#8208;term biosafety, their unique and crucial bioimaging applications in vivo remain unreachable. Herein, planted GQDs are presented as an excellent tool for in vivo fluorescent, sustainable and multimodality tumor bioimaging in various scenarios. The GQDs are in situ planted in the poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) layer of PEGylated nanoparticles via a bottom&#8208;up molecular approach to obtain the NPs&#8208;GQDs&#8208;PEG nanocomposite. The planted GQDs show more than four times prolonged blood circulation and 7&#8211;8 times increased tumor accumulation than typical GQDs in vivo. After accessible specificity modification, the multifunctional NPs&#8208;GQDs&#8208;PEG provides targeted, multimodal molecular imaging for various tumor models in vitro or in vivo. Moreover, the highly photostable GQDs enable long&#8208;term, real&#8208;time visualization of the local pharmacokinetics of NPs in vivo. Planting GQDs in PEGylated nanomedicine offers a new strategy for broad in vivo biomedical applications of GQDs.

         <title>Layered Metal Oxide Nanosheets with Enhanced Interlayer Space for Electrochemical Deionization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered metal oxide with enhanced interlayer spacing is synthesized and employed in electrochemical deionization, achieving high salt adsorption capacity&#160;and adsorption rate, and long&#8208;term cycling stability. The electro&#8208;sorption of layered metal oxides originates from the reconstruction of the layered structure based on the "memory effect".








Abstract
Electrochemical deionization is regarded as one of the promising water treatment technologies. Here, CoAl&#8208;layered metal oxide nanosheets intercalated by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) with an enhanced interlayer spacing from 0.76 to 1.33&#160;nm are synthesized and used as an anode. The enlarged interlayer spacing provides an enhanced ion&#8208;diffusion channel and improves the utilization of the interlayer electroactive sites, while heat treatment, transferring layered double hydroxides to layered metal oxides (LMOs), offers additional active oxidation reaction sites to facilitate the electro&#8208;sorption rate, contributing to the high salt adsorption capacity (31.78&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1) and average salt adsorption rate (3.75&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;min&#8722;1) at 1.2&#160;V in 500&#160;mg&#160;L&#8722;1 NaCl solution. In addition, the excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability (92.9%) after 40 cycles proves the strong electronic interaction between SDS and the host layer, which is validated by density functional theory calculations later on. Moreover, the electro&#8208;sorption mechanism of LMOs that originated from the reconstruction of the layered structure based on the &#8220;memory effect&#8221; is revealed according to the X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy peak shifts of Co element. This strategy of expanding the interlayer spacing combined with heat treatment makes LMOs a competitive candidate for electrochemical water deionization.

         <title>Enabling 420&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 Stable Lithium&#8208;Metal Pouch Cells by Lanthanum Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystal plane regulation strategy for lithium&#160;(Li)&#8208;metal anodes is reported by in&#160;situ&#160;lanthanum (La) doping. La&#8208;doped Li metal enables a preferred crystal plane change to (200) from (110) plane, thereby decreasing the reactivity of Li metal toward electrolytes and establishing a stable interface. Consequently, dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8208;metal batteries are achieved under realistic conditions.








Abstract
Lithium (Li)&#160;metal, a promising anode for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries, typically grows along the low&#8208;surface energy (110) plane in the plating process, resulting in uncontrollable dendrite growth and unstable interface. Herein, an unexpected Li growth behavior by lanthanum (La) doping is reported: the preferred orientation turns to (200) from (110) plane, enabling 2D nuclei rather than the usual 1D nuclei upon Li deposition and thus forming a dense and dendrite&#8208;free morphology even at an ultrahigh areal capacity of 10&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. Noticeably, La doping further decreases the reactivity of Li metal toward electrolytes, thereby establishing a stable interface. The dendrite&#8208;free, stable Li anode enables a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.30% at 8&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 for asymmetric Li||LaF3&#8211;Cu cells. A 3.1&#160;Ah LaF3&#8211;Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cell at a high energy density (425.73&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1) with impressive cycling stability (0.0989% decay&#160;per&#160;cycle) under lean electrolyte (1.76&#160;g&#160;Ah&#8722;1) and high cathode loading (5.77&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2) using this doped Li anode is further demonstrated.

         <title>Flattening Grain&#8208;Boundary Grooves for Perovskite Solar Cells with High Optomechanical Reliability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grain&#8208;boundary grooves are found to have important effects on the properties of perovskite heterointerfaces and thus the device performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Especially, flattening grain&#8208;boundary grooves elevates the (opto&#8208;)mechanical reliability, contributing to device efficiency and stability enhancement.








Abstract
Optomechanical reliability has emerged as an important criterion for evaluating the performance and commercialization potential of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to the mechanical&#8208;property mismatch of metal halide perovskites with other device layer. In this work, grain&#8208;boundary grooves, a rarely discussed film microstructural characteristic, are found to impart significant effects on the optomechanical reliability of perovskite&#8211;substrate heterointerfaces and thus PSC performance. By pre&#8208;burying iso&#8208;butylammonium chloride additive in the electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL), GB grooves (GBGs) are flattened and an optomechanically reliable perovskite heterointerface that resists photothermal fatigue is created. The improved mechanical integrity of the ETL&#8211;perovskite heterointerfaces also benefits the charge transport and chemical stability by facilitating carrier injection and reducing moisture or solvent trapping, respectively. Accordingly, high&#8208;performance PSCs which exhibit efficiency retentions of 94.8% under 440 h damp heat test (85% RH and 85 &#176;C), and 93.0% under 2000 h continuous light soaking are achieved.

&lt;p&gt;Grain-boundary grooves are found to have important effects on the properties of perovskite heterointerfaces and thus the device performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Especially, flattening grain-boundary grooves elevates the (opto-)mechanical reliability, contributing to device efficiency and stability enhancement.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optomechanical reliability has emerged as an important criterion for evaluating the performance and commercialization potential of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to the mechanical-property mismatch of metal halide perovskites with other device layer. In this work, grain-boundary grooves, a rarely discussed film microstructural characteristic, are found to impart significant effects on the optomechanical reliability of perovskite&#8211;substrate heterointerfaces and thus PSC performance. By pre-burying iso-butylammonium chloride additive in the electron-transport layer (ETL), GB grooves (GBGs) are flattened and an optomechanically reliable perovskite heterointerface that resists photothermal fatigue is created. The improved mechanical integrity of the ETL&#8211;perovskite heterointerfaces also benefits the charge transport and chemical stability by facilitating carrier injection and reducing moisture or solvent trapping, respectively. Accordingly, high-performance PSCs which exhibit efficiency retentions of 94.8% under 440 h damp heat test (85% RH and 85 &#176;C), and 93.0% under 2000 h continuous light soaking are achieved.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unveiling Charge&#8208;Transport Mechanisms in Electronic Devices Based on Defect&#8208;Engineered MoS2 Covalent Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent networks of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) represent an efficient strategy to reduce the interflake junction resistance in thin&#8208;film devices. This multiscale investigation reveals that the molecular structure of the linker is crucial to control the overall charge&#8208;transport mechanisms. This work highlights the great potential of defect engineering for the fabrication of high&#8208;performance devices based on covalent TMD networks.








Abstract
Device performance of solution&#8208;processed 2D semiconductors in printed electronics has been limited so far by structural defects and high interflake junction resistance. Covalently interconnected networks of transition metal dichalcogenides potentially represent an efficient strategy to overcome both limitations simultaneously. Yet, the charge&#8208;transport properties in such systems have not been systematically researched. Here, the charge&#8208;transport mechanisms of printed devices based on covalent MoS2 networks are unveiled via multiscale analysis, comparing the effects of aromatic versus aliphatic dithiolated linkers. Temperature&#8208;dependent electrical measurements reveal hopping as the dominant transport mechanism: aliphatic systems lead to 3D variable range hopping, unlike the nearest neighbor hopping observed for aromatic linkers. The novel analysis based on percolation theory attributes the superior performance of devices functionalized with &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules to the improved interflake electronic connectivity and formation of additional percolation paths, as further corroborated by density functional calculations. Valuable guidelines for harnessing the charge&#8208;transport properties in MoS2 devices based on covalent networks are provided.

         <title>Triclinic&#8208;Phase Bismuth Chromate: A Promising Candidate for Photocatalytic Water Splitting with Broad Spectrum Ranges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and crystal structure verification of a novel triclinic bismuth chromate, Bi2CrO6, are reported. Detailed investigations on the electronic structure and the capability of both visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven water oxidation and reduction reactions, as well as the fabrication of a Z&#8208;scheme overall water splitting system are reported, demonstrating a huge potential of the triclinic Bi2CrO6 in photocatalysis.








Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting for solar energy conversion remains challenged by the lack of novel semiconductor photocatalysts with paramount parameters including wide light&#8208;harvesting ranges and suitable band structures. Here, a novel triclinic&#8208;phase bismuth chromate (Bi2CrO6) acting as a semiconductor photocatalyst candidate is reported. Triclinic Bi2CrO6 exhibits a broad absorption range of &#8776;650&#160;nm with a direct bandgap of 1.86&#160;eV and shows a suitable band structure for water splitting. Theoretical simulations of triclinic Bi2CrO6 reveal a high charge mobility,&#160;possibly owing to the strong hybridized covalent bonds, large elastic modulus, and small carrier effective mass. The triclinic Bi2CrO6 is demonstrated to work well toward photocatalytic water oxidation and hydrogen production reactions under visible light and match well with its absorption ranges. In particular, it exhibits decent photocatalytic water oxidation performance in the presence of various electron scavengers. Furthermore, the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven Z&#8208;scheme overall water splitting system is fabricated by coupling triclinic Bi2CrO6 as the oxygen evolution photocatalyst with SrTiO3:Rh as the hydrogen evolution photocatalyst, giving a stable overall water splitting with stoichiometric evolution of H2 and O2. This work presents a promising semiconductor material enabling wide&#8208;range light harvesting for photocatalytic and photo&#8208;electrochemical solar energy conversion.

         <title>Highly Reversible Lithium Metal Anode Enabled by 3D Lithiophilic&#8211;Lithiophobic Dual&#8208;Skeletons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A free&#8208;standing composite Li metal anode (Li&#8208;B@SSM) with hierarchical 3D lithiophilic&#8211;lithiophobic dual&#8208;skeletons is developed via a facile roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll mechanical pressing of stainless&#8208;steel mesh (SSM) and Li&#8208;B alloy. The coupling of micro&#8208;gridding SSM framework and LiB nanofibers enables site&#8208;selective Li stripping/plating processes, achieving excellent cycle performance and practically feasible Li metal anodes.








Abstract
Lithium metal is a promising anode for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium batteries, but its practical application is still hindered by intrinsic defects such as infinite volume expansion and uncontrollable dendrite growth. Herein, a dendrite&#8208;free 3D composite Li anode (Li&#8208;B@SSM) is prepared by mechanical rolling of lithiophilic LiB nanofibers supported by Li&#8211;B composite and lithiophobic stainless&#8208;steel mesh (SSM). Featuring hierarchical lithiophilic&#8211;lithiophobic dual&#8208;skeletons, the Li&#8208;B@SSM anode shows an ultrahigh Coulombic efficiency of 99.95% and a long lifespan of 900 h under 2 mA cm&#8722;2/1 mAh cm&#8722;2. It is demonstrated that the abnormally reversible Li stripping/plating processes should be closely related to the site&#8208;selective plating behavior and spatial confinement effect induced by the robust lithiophilic&#8211;lithiophobic dual&#8208;skeletons, which alleviates the volume changes, suppresses the growth of Li dendrites, and reduces the accumulation of &#8220;dead&#8221; Li. More importantly, the application feasibility of the Li&#8208;B@SSM anode is also confirmed in full batteries, of which the Li&#8208;B@SSM|LiFePO4 full cell shows a high capacity retention of 97.5% after 400 cycles&#160;while the Li&#8208;B@SSM|S pouch battery exhibits good cycle stability even under practically harsh conditions. This work paves the way for the facile and efficient fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency Li metal anodes toward practical applications.

         <title>Hydrogel with Robust Adhesion in Various Liquid Environments by Electrostatic&#8208;Induced Hydrophilic and Hydrophobic Polymer Chains Migration and Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pressure&#8208;sensitive hydrogel exhibits robust adhesion in aqueous solution and oil environments by electrostatic&#8208;induced hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer chains migration and rearrangement, which realizes the removal of the interfacial liquid layer and the effective interfacial bonding during wet adhesion. This polymer&#8208;chains&#8208;regulated hydrogel provides a new strategy for adhesion in liquid environments, broadening the application scenarios of adhesives.








Abstract
Hydrogels with wet adhesion are promising interfacial adhesive materials; however, their adhesion in water, oil, or organic solvents remains a major challenge. To address this, a pressure&#8208;sensitive P(AAm&#8208;co&#8208;C18)/PTA&#8208;Fe hydrogel is fabricated, which exhibits robust adhesion to various substrates in both aqueous solutions and oil environments. It is demonstrated that the key to wet adhesion under liquid conditions is the removal of the interfacial liquid, which can be achieved through rational molecular composition regulation. By complexing with hydrophilic polymer networks, phosphotungstic acid (PTA) is introduced into the hydrogel network as a physical cross&#8208;linker and anchor point to improve the cohesion strength and drive the migration of polymer chains. The migration and rearrangement of hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer chains on the hydrogel surface are induced by the electrostatic interactions of Fe3+, which create a surface with interfacial water&#8208; and oil&#8208;removing properties. By co&#8208;regulating the hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer chains, the P(AAm&#8208;co&#8208;C18)/PTA&#8208;Fe hydrogel is able to act as a pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesive under water and oils with adhesion strength of 92.6 and 90.0&#160;kPa, respectively. It is anticipated that this regulation strategy for polymer chains will promote the development of wet adhesion hydrogels, which can have a wide range of applications.

It is demonstrated that the key to wet adhesion under liquid conditions is the removal of the interfacial liquid, which can be achieved through rational molecular composition regulation. By complexing with hydrophilic polymer networks, phosphotungstic acid (PTA) is introduced into the hydrogel network as a physical cross-linker and anchor point to improve the cohesion strength and drive the migration of polymer chains. The migration and rearrangement of hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer chains on the hydrogel surface are induced by the electrostatic interactions of Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, which create a surface with interfacial water- and oil-removing properties. By co-regulating the hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer chains, the P(AAm-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;)/PTA-Fe hydrogel is able to act as a pressure-sensitive adhesive under water and oils with adhesion strength of 92.6 and 90.0&#160;kPa, respectively. It is anticipated that this regulation strategy for polymer chains will promote the development of wet adhesion hydrogels, which can have a wide range of applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Comprehensively Understanding the Role of Anion Vacancies on K&#8208;Ion Storage: A Case Study of Se&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Engineered VSe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Se&#8208;vacancy&#8208;engineered VSe2 is proposed to reveal the role of anion vacancies on the K+ storage of conversion&#8208;type anode materials. The results reveal that Se vacancies boost the first potassiation by offering additional K+ adsorption sites and diffusion channels in the intercalation stage and weakening bond strength in the conversion stage. In addition, Se vacancies disappear&#160;after the first potassiation.








Abstract
Anion vacancy engineering (AVE) is widely used to improve the Li&#8208;ion and Na&#8208;ion storage of conversion&#8208;type anode materials. However, AVE is still an emerging strategy in K&#8208;ion batteries, which are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage. In addition, the role of anion vacancies on ion storage is far from clear, despite several proposed explanations. Herein, by employing VSe2 as a model conversion&#8208;type anode material, Se vacancies are intentionally introduced (labeled as P&#8208;VSe2&#8722;x) to investigate their effect on K+ storage. The P&#8208;VSe2&#8722;x shows excellent cyclability in half cells (143&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 3.0&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles) and high energy density in coin&#8208;type full cells (206.8&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1). By applying various electrochemical techniques, the effects of Se vacancies on the redox potentials of K&#8208;ion insertion/extraction and the K&#8208;ion diffusion in electrodes upon cycling are uncovered. In addition, the structural evolution of Se vacancies during potassiation/de&#8208;potassiation using various operando and ex characterizations is revealed. Moreover, it is demonstrated that Se vacancies can facilitate the breaking of V&#63743;Se bonds upon the P&#8208;VSe2&#8722;x conversion using theoretical calculations. This work comprehensively explains the role of anion vacancies in ion storage for developing high&#8208;performance conversion&#8208;type anode materials.

         <title>A General Strategy to Remove Metal Aggregates toward Metal&#8211;Nitrogen&#8211;Carbon Catalysts with Exclusive Atomic Dispersion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and efficient strategy is developed to obtain metal&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;doped carbons (M&#8211;N&#8211;Cs) with exclusive atomic dispersion by making use of ammonium iodide as a high&#8208;temperature etchant to remove excessive crystalline metal aggregates, which eases the identification of the genuine catalytically active sites and enables the rational design and synthesis of high&#8208;performance M&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts.








Abstract
Metal&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;doped nanocarbons (M&#8211;N&#8211;Cs) are promising alternatives to precious metals for catalyzing electrochemical energy conversion processes. However, M&#8211;N&#8211;Cs synthesized by high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis frequently suffer from compositional heterogeneity with the simultaneous presence of atomically dispersed M&#8211;Nx sites and crystalline metal nanoparticles (NPs), which hinders the identification of active sites and rational optimization in performance. Herein, a universal and efficient strategy is reported to obtain both precious&#8208; and nonprecious&#8208;metal&#8208;based M&#8211;N&#8211;Cs (M = Pt, Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Cu, Zn) with exclusive atomic dispersion by making use of ammonium iodide as the etchant to remove excessive metal aggregates at high temperature. Taking Pt&#8211;N&#8211;C as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, the complete removal of Pt NPs in Pt&#8211;N&#8211;C enables clarification on the contributions of the atomic Pt&#8211;Nx moieties and Pt NPs to the catalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction. Combined electrochemical measurements and theoretical calculations identify that the atomic Pt&#8211;Nx moieties by themselves possess negligible activity, but they can significantly boost the activity of the Pt NPs via the synergistic effect.

         <title>Bistable Joints Enable the Morphing of Hydrogel Sheets with Multistable Configurations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Active joints are designed by using a stiff gel as a frame and a responsive gel as an actuating unit. The response mismatch in the joint with in&#8208;plane gradient leads to folding or twisting with the feature of bistability. Integration of multiple joints into one hydrogel enables the formation of multistable configurations that facilitate designs of hydrogel devices with versatile functions.








Abstract
Joints, as a flexing element to connect different parts, are widespread in natural systems. Various joints exist in the body and play crucial roles to execute gestures and gaits. These scenarios have inspired the design of mechanical joints with passive, hard materials, which usually need an external power supply to drive the transformations. The incorporation of soft and active joints provides a modular strategy to devise soft actuators and robots. However, transformations of responsive joints under external stimuli are usually in uni&#8208;mode with a pre&#8208;determined direction. Here, hydrogel joints capable of folding and twisting transformation in bi&#8208;mode are reported, which enable the composite hydrogel to form multiple configurations under constant conditions. These joints have an in&#8208;plane gradient structure and comprise stiff, passive gel as the frame and soft, active gel as the actuating unit. Under external stimuli, the response mismatch between different gels leads to out&#8208;of&#8208;plane folding or twisting deformation with the feature of bistability. These joints can be modularly integrated with other gels to afford complex deformations and multistable configurations. This approach favors selective control of hydrogel's architectures and versatile design of hydrogel devices, as demonstrated by proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept examples. It shall also merit the development of metamaterials, soft actuators, and robots, etc.

         <title>Ultrasmooth and Dense Lithium Deposition Toward High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasmooth and dense lithium &#160;deposition is achieved by ingenious synergy of vertically aligned nanosheet arrays and ultrathin Li2S&#8208;rich solid&#160;electrolyte interphase (SEI). Specifically, nanosheet arrays possess the proper surface area to reduce local current density and avoid excessive side reactions. Moreover, moveable Li2S&#8208;rich SEI with electronically insulating properties can homogenize lithium&#8208;ion flux and inhibit electron escape to avoid electrolyte decomposition.








Abstract
Lithium (Li)&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) with stable solid&#160;electrolyte interphase (SEI) and dendrite&#8208;free formation have great potential in next&#8208;generation energy storage devices. Here, vertically aligned 3D Cu2S nanosheet arrays are&#160;fabricated&#160;on the surface of commercial Cu foils, which in&#160;situ generate ultrathin Cu nanosheet arrays to reduce local current density and Li2S layers on the surfaces to work as an&#160;excellent artificial SEI. It is found that Li presents a 3D&#8208;to&#8208;planar deposition model, and Li2S layers are reversibly movable between the&#160;3D nanosheet surface and 2D planar surface of Li during long&#8208;term cycling. This enables ultrasmooth and dense Li deposition at 1&#160;mA cm&#8208;2, presenting an average thickness of &#8776;53.0&#160;&#181;m at 10 mAh cm&#8208;2, which is close to the theoretical Li foil thickness and is highly reversible at different cycles. Thus, 1150 stable cycles with high Coulombic efficiency (CE, 99.1%) at ether&#8208;based electrolytes and 300 stable cycles with high CE (98.8%) at carbonate electrolytes are realized in half&#8208;cell with a capacity of 1 mAh cm&#8208;2 at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8208;2. When coupled with commercial cathodes (LiFePO4 or LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2), the full cells present substantially enhanced cyclability under high cathode loading, limited (or zero) Li excess, and lean electrolyte conditions, even at &#8722;20 &#176;C.

Here, vertically aligned 3D Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S nanosheet arrays are&#160;fabricated&#160;on the surface of commercial Cu foils, which in&#160;situ generate ultrathin Cu nanosheet arrays to reduce local current density and Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S layers on the surfaces to work as an&#160;excellent artificial SEI. It is found that Li presents a 3D-to-planar deposition model, and Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S layers are reversibly movable between the&#160;3D nanosheet surface and 2D planar surface of Li during long-term cycling. This enables ultrasmooth and dense Li deposition at 1&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;, presenting an average thickness of &#8776;53.0&#160;&#181;m at 10 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is close to the theoretical Li foil thickness and is highly reversible at different cycles. Thus, 1150 stable cycles with high Coulombic efficiency (CE, 99.1%) at ether-based electrolytes and 300 stable cycles with high CE (98.8%) at carbonate electrolytes are realized in half-cell with a capacity of 1 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;. When coupled with commercial cathodes (LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), the full cells present substantially enhanced cyclability under high cathode loading, limited (or zero) Li excess, and lean electrolyte conditions, even at &#8722;20 &#176;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Zn&#63743;N5 Sites Immobilized on g&#8208;C3N4 Nanosheets for Ultrasensitive Selective Detection of Phenanthrene by Dual Ratiometric Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed Zn(II)&#63743;N5 sites are immobilized on g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets for detecting phenanthrene (PHE) by dual ratiometric fluorescence with ultrahigh sensitivity (limit of detection = 0.35 ng L&#8722;1) and selectivity among typical polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons due to favorable selective adsorption of PHE on as&#8208;constructed atomic Zn(II)&#63743;N5 sites via the ionic cation&#8211;&#960; interactions (Zn&#948;+&#63743;C2&#948;&#8722; type).








Abstract
Ultrasensitively selective detection of trace polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) like phenanthrene (PHE) is critical but remains challenging. Herein, atomically dispersed Zn sites on g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets (sZn&#8208;CN) are constructed by thermal polymerization of a Zn&#8211;cyanuric acid&#8211;melamine supramolecular precursor for the fluorescence detection of PHE. A high amount (1.6 wt%) of sZn is grafted in the cave of CN with one N vacancy in the form of unique Zn(II)&#63743;N5 coordination. The optimized sZn&#8208;CN achieves a wide detection range (1 ng L&#8722;1 to 5 mg L&#8722;1), ultralow detection limit (0.35 ng L&#8722;1, with 5&#8208;order magnitude improvement over CN), and ultrahigh selectivity toward PHE even among typical PAHs based on the built PHE&#8208;CN dual ratiometric fluorescence method. By means of in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, time&#8208;resolved absorption&#160;and fluorescence spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations, the resulting superior detection performance is attributed to the favorable selective adsorption of PHE on as&#8208;constructed atomic Zn(II)&#63743;N5 sites via the ionic cation&#8211;&#960; interactions (Zn&#948;+&#63743;C2&#948;&#8722; type), and the fluorescence quenching is dominated by the inner filter effect (IFE) from the multilayer adsorption of PHE at low concentrations, while it is done by the protruded photogenerated electron&#8208;transfer process, as well as IFE from the monolayer adsorption of PHE at ultralow concentration.

Plasmonic&#8208;Nanogap Particles
Plasmonic&#8208;nanogap particles offer a highly enhanced electromagnetic field inside the gap, which is useful for surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)&#8208;based sensing applications. In article number 2208250, Jwa&#8208;Min Nam and co&#8208;workers report the design and synthesis of plasmonic dual&#8208;gap nanodumbbell particles with an open gap. Analytes such as DNA can diffuse into this gap for dye&#8208;free molecular sensing with SERS signals.

Charge&#8208;Transport Mechanisms
A multiscale investigation of the charge&#8208;transport mechanisms in covalently interconnected networks of MoS2 nanosheets is presented by Paolo Samor&#236; and co&#8208;workers in article number 2211157. The chemical structure of the dithiolated bridging linker is critical, with &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems outperforming aliphatic molecules thereby boosting interflake transport. These findings highlight the great potential of defect engineering for the fabrication of high&#8208;performance MoS2 devices.

Self&#8208;Organization
In article number 2110038, Cheng Yang and co&#8208;workers develop an innovative transient&#8208;laser&#8208;induced fabrication technology to obtain high&#8208;melting&#8208;point well&#8208;ordered TiNx nanonetworks by transient entropy&#8208;driven self&#8208;organization. Such a method features potentially major advances in mass fabrication of highly conductive and high&#8208;polarity nanostructured electrodes for compact high&#8208;frequency filter capacitors.

Dendrite&#8208;Free Metal Batteries
In article number 2210447, Yong Cheng, Quanfeng Dong, Ming&#8208;Sheng Wang, and co&#8208;workers reveal the Na/K plating/stripping behaviors in carbon capsules with open mesochannels by in situ electron microscopy. These mesochannels can boost surface ion diffusion, and, after metal filling, they become superfast channels for Na/K transport via interfacial diffusion. Such pore&#8208;modified carbon hosts enable dendrite&#8208;free sodium deposition and superior high&#8208;rate performance for future large&#8208;scale stationary energy storage.

         <title>A Biomolecular Toolbox for Precision Nanomotors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanomotors are a new and exciting field of research for biomedical applications. Many diverse nanomotor systems have been studied in recent years with great promise. Precision targeting of nanomotors is necessary for translation from the laboratory to the clinic. A biomolecular toolbox to achieve precision targeting is presented, consisting of targeting molecules, conjugation strategies, and extracellular targets.








Abstract
The application of nanomotors for cancer diagnosis and therapy is a new and exciting area of research, which when combined with precision nanomedicine, promises to solve many of the issues encountered by previous development of passive nanoparticles. The goal of this article is to introduce nanomotor and nanomedicine researchers to the deep pool of knowledge available regarding cancer cell biology and biochemistry, as well as provide a greater appreciation of the complexity of cell membrane compositions, extracellular surfaces, and their functional consequences. A short description of the nanomotor state&#8208;of&#8208;art for cancer therapy and diagnosis is first provided, as well as recommendations for future directions of the field. Then, a biomolecular targeting toolbox has been collated for researchers looking to apply their nanomaterial of choice to a biological setting, as well as providing a glimpse into currently available clinical therapies and technologies. This toolbox contains an overview of different classes of targeting molecules available for high affinity and specific targeting and cell surface targets to aid researchers in the selection of a clinical disease model and targeting methodology. It is hoped that this review will provide biological context, inspiration, and direction to future nanomotor and nanomedicine research.

         <title>A Review on Regulating Li+ Solvation Structures in Carbonate Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 15, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The performance of carbonate electrolytes for lithium metal batteries (LMBs) is highly influenced by the solvation structure of Li+. A comprehensive overview of strategies is presented for regulating the solvation structure of Li+ in carbonate electrolytes to improve Li+ behavior and the performance of LMBs. The remaining questions and perspectives for advanced carbonate electrolytes for LMBs are also outlined.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are considered promising candidates for next&#8208;generation battery systems due to their high energy density. However, commercialized carbonate electrolytes cannot be used in LMBs due to their poor compatibility with lithium metal anodes. While increasing cut&#8208;off voltage is an effective way to boost the energy density of LMBs, conventional ethylene carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes undergo a number of side reactions at high voltages. It is therefore critical to upgrade conventional carbonate electrolytes, the performance of which is highly influenced by the solvation structure of lithium ions (Li+). This review provides a comprehensive overview of the strategies to regulate the solvation structure of Li+ in carbonate electrolytes for LMBs by better understanding the science behind the Li+ solvation structure and Li+ behavior. Different strategies are systematically compared to help select better electrolytes for specific applications. The remaining scientific and technical problems are pointed out, and directions for future research on carbonate electrolytes for LMBs are proposed.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin crystalline ferroelectric polymer based on trichloromethyl (CCl3)&#8208;terminated poly(vinylidene difluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifloroethylene) (P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)) is developed on AlOX to realize negative&#8208;capacitance metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor field&#8208;effect transistors (MOSFETs) with a MoS2 channel. Systematic adjustment of the thickness ratio between the polymer and dielectric AlOX achieves a hysteresis&#8208;free FET with a minimum subthreshold swing of 28 mV dec&#8722;1, operating at less than 2 V.








Abstract
Negative&#8208;capacitance field&#8208;effect transistors (NC&#8208;FETs) have gathered enormous interest as a way to reduce subthreshold swing (SS) and overcome the issue of power dissipation in modern integrated circuits. For stable NC behavior at low operating voltages, the development of ultrathin ferroelectrics (FE), which are compatible with the industrial process, is of great interest. Here, a new scalable ultrathin ferroelectric polymer layer is developed based on trichloromethyl (CCl3)&#8208;terminated poly(vinylidene difluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifloroethylene) (P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)) to achieve the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance of NC&#8208;FETs. The crystalline phase of 5&#8211;10&#160;nm ultrathin P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) is prepared on AlOX by a newly developed brush method, which enables an FE/dielectric (DE) bilayer. FE/DE thickness ratios are then systematically tuned at ease to achieve ideal capacitance matching. NC&#8208;FETs with optimized FE/DE thickness at a thickness limit demonstrate hysteresis&#8208;free operation with an SS of 28&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 at &#8776;1.5&#160;V, which competes with the best reports. This P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)&#8208;brush layer can be broadly adapted to NC&#8208;FETs, opening an exciting avenue for low&#8208;power devices.

         <title>Large Magnetoresistance of Isolated Domain Walls in LSMO Nanowires</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The generation, manipulation and sensing of magnetic domain walls is a cornerstone in the design of more efficient spintronic devices. Half&#8208;metals are amenable for this purpose as large low field magnetoresistance signals can be expected from spin accumulation at spin textures. However, half metals are scarce and in many case present chemical stability problems. La1&#8208;xSrxMnO3 (LSMO) manganites are considered an alternative for their robust half&#8208;metallic ground state, Curie temperature above room temperature (Tc = 360 K, for x = 1/3) and chemical stability. Yet the domain wall magnetoresistance is poorly understood with large discrepancies in the reported values and conflicting interpretation of experimental data due to the entanglement of various source of magnetoresistance, namely, spin accumulation, anisotropic magnetoresistance and colossal magnetoresistance. In this work we have measured the domain wall magnetoresistance in LSMO cross&#8208;shape nanowire devices with single domain walls precisely nucleated across the current path, as confirmed by space&#8208;resolved magnetic&#8208;sensitive microscopy techniques. We find magnetoresistance values above 10% originating at the spin accumulation caused by the mistracking effect of the spin texture of the domain wall by the conduction electrons. Fundamentally, this result shows the importance on non&#8208;adiabatic processes at spin textures despite the strong Hund coupling to the localized t2g electrons of the manganite. Moreover, the large values of the magnetoresistance in excess of 10% are high enough for encoding and reading magnetic bits in future oxide spintronic sensors.

         <title>Principles of Design and Synthesis of Metal Derivatives from MOFs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have complex structures and can be made using low&#8208;cost methods, but their low electrical conductivity and instability limit their use. Metal&#8208;based derivatives of MOFs (MDs) may be a solution, retaining the complexity of MOFs while having improved stability and conductivity. This review covers various types of MDs including oxides, sulfides, nitrides, phosphides, transition metals, carbides, and more.








Abstract
Materials derived from metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have demonstrated exceptional structural variety and complexity and can be synthesized using low&#8208;cost scalable methods. Although the inherent instability and low electrical conductivity of MOFs are largely responsible for their low uptake for catalysis and energy storage, a superior alternative is MOF&#8208;derived metal&#8208;based derivatives (MDs) as these can retain the complex nanostructures of MOFs while exhibiting stability and electrical conductivities of several orders of magnitude higher. The present work comprehensively reviews MDs in terms of synthesis and their nanostructural design, including oxides, sulfides, phosphides, nitrides, carbides, transition metals, and other minor species. The focal point of the approach is the identification and rationalization of the design parameters that lead to the generation of optimal compositions, structures, nanostructures, and resultant performance parameters. The aim of this approach is to provide an inclusive platform for the strategies to design and process these materials for specific applications. This work is complemented by detailed figures that both summarize the design and processing approaches that have been reported and indicate potential trajectories for development. The work is also supported by comprehensive and up&#8208;to&#8208;date tabular coverage of the reported studies.

         <title>Revisiting the Design Strategies for Metasurfaces: Fundamental Physics, Optimization, and Beyond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metasurfaces are ultracompact optical components that can manipulate light. Conventional design principles of metasurfaces based on unit&#8208;cell approach are introduced, which includes retrieval of source fields that generate desired light fields and materialization of the source fields. Then, unconventional metasurfaces that may provide opportunities beyond the conventional design principles are discussed.








Abstract
Over the last two decades, the capabilities of metasurfaces in light modulation with subwavelength thickness have been proven, and metasurfaces are expected to miniaturize conventional optical components and add various functionalities. Herein, various metasurface design strategies are reviewed thoroughly. First, the scalar diffraction theory is revisited to provide the basic principle of light propagation. Then, widely used design methods based on the unit&#8208;cell approach are discussed. The methods include a set of simplified steps, including the phase&#8208;map retrieval and meta&#8208;atom unit&#8208;cell design. Then, recently emerging metasurfaces that may not be accurately designed using unit&#8208;cell approach are introduced. Unconventional metasurfaces are examined where the conventional design methods fail and finally potential design methods for such metasurfaces are discussed.

         <title>Advanced Material Design and Engineering for Water&#8208;Based Evaporative Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Evaporation&#8208;induced cooling effect is gaining significant interest due to its low carbon footprint and low or even zero electricity consumption. This review systematically introduces the fundamentals and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art material design and engineering in water&#8208;based evaporative cooling technologies, and critically assess the challenges and offers outlooks on future development of this emerging field.








Abstract
Water&#8208;based evaporative cooling is emerging as a promising technology to provide sustainable and low&#8208;cost cold to alleviate the rising global cooling demand. Given the significant and fast progress made in recent years, this review aims to provide a timely overview on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art material design and engineering in water&#8208;based evaporative cooling. The fundamental mechanisms and major components of three water&#8208;based evaporative cooling processes are introduced, including direct evaporative cooling, cyclic sorption&#8208;driven liquid water evaporative cooling (CSD&#8208;LWEC), and atmospheric water harvesting&#8208;based evaporative cooling (AWH&#8208;EC). The distinctive requirements on the sorbent materials in CSD&#8208;LWEC and AWH&#8208;EC are highlighted, which helps synthesize the literature information on the advanced material design and engineering for the purpose of improving cooling performance. The challenges and future outlooks on further improving the water&#8208;based evaporative cooling performance are also provided.

         <title>Engineering Female Germline Stem Cells with Exocytotic Polymer Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Germline stem cells (GSCs) are the only cell population capable of passing genetic information to offspring, making them attractive targets in reproductive biology and fertility research. However, it is generally more difficult to introduce exogenous biomolecules into GSCs than other cell types, impeding the exploration and manipulation of these cells for biomedical purposes. Herein, we develop semiconductor polymer dots (Pdots)&#8208;based nanocomplex Pdot&#8208;siRNA and achieve effective knockdown of target genes in FGSCs. We take advantage of high fluorescence brightness of Pdots for comprehensive investigation of their cellular uptake, intracellular trafficking and exocytosis in FGSCs. Importantly, Pdots show excellent biocompatibility and minimally disturb the differentiation of FGSCs. Intracellular Pdots escape from the lysosomes and undergo active exocytosis, which make them ideal nanocarriers for bioactive cargos. Moreover, Pdot&#8208;siRNA can penetrate into 3D ovarian organoids derived from FGSCs and down&#8208;regulate the expression levels of target genes. Our study investigates the interface between a type of theranostic nanoparticles and FGSCs for the first time and sheds lights on the manipulation and medical application of FGSCs.

Abstract
Intelligent rewritable display systems have been long&#8208;expected to reduce the heavy consumption of single&#8208;use or transient devices in the age of Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things. However, it remains challenging to construct such systems with integrated functionality of remote control, rapid activation, multicolor and multimode display. Herein, by learning from the unique multilayer arrangement of chromatophores in chameleon skins, we present a promising kind of rewritable hydrogel multicolor systems that can combine the merits of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;writing &amp; projecting modes for on&#8208;demand information display. Specifically, the systems have typical multilayer layout consisting of PDMS&#8208;sealed carbon nanotubes (CNTs) film as photothermal control unit and embedded fluorescent hydrogels as multicolor display unit, in which thermo&#8208;responsive hydrogel is constrained within non&#8208;responsive hydrogel. Such rational structure design results in the establishment of one promising display mechanism via the cascading &#8220;light trigger&#8208;heat generation&#8208;fluorescence output&#8221; process. On this basis, rapid and reversible hand&#8208;written display of arbitrary information is achieved within 5 s. Also, sustainable light&#8208;projecting display of predesigned multicolor patterns is demonstrated due to the multilayer design that ensures easy patterning of photothermal control or hydrogel display layer. This study brings functional&#8208;integrated merits for novel rewritable display systems and open new possibility to construct high&#8208;end products for information display/transmission.

&lt;p&gt;Intelligent rewritable display systems have been long-expected to reduce the heavy consumption of single-use or transient devices in the age of Internet-of-Things. However, it remains challenging to construct such systems with integrated functionality of remote control, rapid activation, multicolor and multimode display. Herein, by learning from the unique multilayer arrangement of chromatophores in chameleon skins, we present a promising kind of rewritable hydrogel multicolor systems that can combine the merits of near-infrared (NIR) light-writing &amp; projecting modes for on-demand information display. Specifically, the systems have typical multilayer layout consisting of PDMS-sealed carbon nanotubes (CNTs) film as photothermal control unit and embedded fluorescent hydrogels as multicolor display unit, in which thermo-responsive hydrogel is constrained within non-responsive hydrogel. Such rational structure design results in the establishment of one promising display mechanism via the cascading &#8220;light trigger-heat generation-fluorescence output&#8221; process. On this basis, rapid and reversible hand-written display of arbitrary information is achieved within 5 s. Also, sustainable light-projecting display of predesigned multicolor patterns is demonstrated due to the multilayer design that ensures easy patterning of photothermal control or hydrogel display layer.

         <title>Remote Water&#8208;to&#8208;Air Eavesdropping With a Phase&#8208;Engineered Impedance Matching Metasurface</title>

Abstract
Efficiently receiving underwater sound remotely from air is a long&#8208;standing challenge in acoustics hindered by the large impedance mismatch at the water&#8208;air interface. Here, a phase&#8208;engineered water&#8208;air impedance matching metasurface is proposed and experimentally demonstrated for remote and efficient water&#8208;to&#8208;air eavesdropping. The judiciously&#8208;designed metasurface with near&#8208;unity transmission efficiency, long monitoring distance and high mechanical stiffness is capable of making the water&#8208;air interface acoustically transparent and at the same time freewheelingly patterning the transmitted wavefront. This enables efficient control over the effective spatial location of a distant airborne sensor such that it can measure underwater signals with large signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio as if placed close to the physical underwater source. Such airborne eavesdropping of underwater sound is experimentally demonstrated with a measured sensitivity enhancement of nearly 104 at 8&#160;kHz, far from achievable with the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods. Moreover, the opportunities of using the proposed metasurface for cross&#8208;media orbital&#8208;angular&#8208;momentum&#8208;multiplexed communication and underwater acoustic window are also demonstrated. Our metasurface opens new avenues for communication and sensing in inhomogeneities with totally&#8208;reflective interfaces, which may be translated to nano&#8208;optics and radio&#8208;frequencies.

         <title>Mixed Matrix Membranes with Surface Functionalized Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Sieves for Efficient Propylene/Propane Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Membrane technology, regarded as an environmentally friendly and sustainable approach, offers great potential to address the large energy penalty associated with the energy&#8208;intensive propylene/propane separation. Quest for molecular sieving membranes for this important separation is of tremendous interest. Here, a fluorinated metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) material, known as KAUST&#8208;7 (KAUST: King Abdullah University of Science and Technology) with well&#8208;defined narrow one&#8208;dimensional channels that can effectively discriminate propylene from propane based on a size&#8208;sieving mechanism, has been successfully incorporated into a polyimide matrix to fabricate molecular sieving mixed matrix membranes (MMMs). Markedly, the surface functionalization of KAUST&#8208;7 nanoparticles with carbene moieties affords the requisite interfacial compatibility, with minimal nonselective defects at polymer&#8208;filler interfaces, for the fabrication of a molecular sieving MMM. The optimal membrane with a high MOF loading (up to 45 wt%) displays a propylene permeability of &#8764;95 barrer and a mixed propylene/propane selectivity of &#8764;20, far exceeding the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art upper bound limits. Moreover, the resultant membrane exhibits robust structural stability under practical conditions, including high pressures (up to 8&#160;bar) and temperatures (up to 100&#176;C). The observed outstanding performance attests to the importance of surface engineering for the preparation and plausible deployment of high&#8208;performance MMMs for industrial applications.

         <title>Isomeric Solid Additive Enables High&#8208;Efficiency Polymer Solar Cells Developed Using a Benzo&#8208;difuran&#8208;based Donor Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Currently, nearly all high&#8208;efficiency organic photovoltaic devices use donor polymers based on the benzo&#8208;dithiophene (BDT) unit. To diversify the choices of building blocks for high&#8208;performance donor polymers, we explored the use of benzo&#8208;difuran (BDF) units, which could achieve reduced steric hindrance, stronger molecular packing, and tunable energy levels. In previous research, the performances of BDF&#8208;based devices lagged behind those of BDT&#8208;based devices. In this study, we achieved a high efficiency (18.4%) using a BDF&#8208;based polymer donor, which is the highest efficiency reported for BDF donor materials to date. The high efficiency is enabled by a donor polymer (D18&#8208;Fu) and the aid of a solid additive (2&#8208;chloronaphthalene), which is the isomer of the commonly used additive 1&#8208;chloronaphthalene. Our results revealed the significant effect of 2&#8208;chloronaphthalene in optimizing the morphology and enhancing the device parameters. Our work not only provides a new building block that can achieve an efficiency comparable to dominant BDT units but also proposes a new solid additive that could replace the widely used 1&#8208;chloronaphthalene additive.

         <title>Polarization Switching and Correlated Phase Transitions in Fluorite&#8208;Structure ZrO2 Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Unconventional ferroelectricity in fluorite&#8208;structure oxides enables tremendous opportunities in nanoelectronics owing to their superior scalability and silicon compatibility. However, their polarization order and switching process remain elusive due to the challenges of visualizing oxygen ions in nanocrystalline films. Here, we directly capture the oxygen shifting during polarization switching and correlated polar&#8208;nonpolar phase transitions among multiple metastable phases in freestanding ZrO2 thin films by low&#8208;dose integrated differential phase&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC&#8208;STEM). Bidirectional transitions between antiferroelectric and ferroelectric orders and interfacial polarization relaxation are clarified at unit&#8208;cell scale. Meanwhile, polarization switching is strongly correlated with Zr&#8208;O displacement in reversible martensitic transformation between monoclinic and orthorhombic phases and two&#8208;step tetrahedral&#8208;to&#8208;orthorhombic phase transition. These findings provide atomic insights into the transition pathways between metastable polymorphs and unravel the evolution of polarization orders in (anti)ferroelectric fluorite oxides.

         <title>Regulation of Quantum Wells Width Distribution in Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskite Films for High&#8208;Performance Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Dynamic optimization of the quantum&#8208;well (QW) width distribution in quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;2D) halide perovskite thin films is an effective approach for tuning the properties of photoelectric devices. Here, we demonstrate that the QWs width distribution in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films can be controlled only by using hydroiodic acid (HI) as an additive. A uniform distribution of the colloidal particle size in the quasi&#8208;2D perovskite precursor solution was achieved through the formation of soluble iodoplumbate coordination complexes, PbI3&#8722; from the reaction of HI with PbI2, resulting in an improved phase purity in the final film. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the ideal n value quasi&#8208;2D perovskite reaction pathway through the PbI3&#8722; complex has a lower enthalpy of formation than the random nucleation pathway without the HI additive. Benefiting from this merit, a high&#8208;quality quasi&#8208;2D perovskite film with optimized phase purity delivered a balanced carrier diffusion length and improved carrier mobility. The resultant photodetectors exhibited a light on/off ratio of 50000, a responsivity of 0.96 A W&#8722;1, and a detectivity of 5.7 &#215; 1012 Jones at 532&#160;nm. In addition, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device maintained more than 80% of its initial photocurrent after 720&#160;h of storage at 30% relative humidity.

         <title>Emerging Trend in Soft Electronics: Integrating Machine Intelligence with Soft Acoustic/ Vibration Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In the last decade, soft acoustic/ vibration sensors have gained tremendous research interest due to their unique ability to detect broadband acoustic/ vibration stimuli, potentializing futuristic applications including voice biometrics, voice&#8208;controlled human&#8208;machine&#8208;interface (HMI), electronic skin (e&#8208;skins) and skin&#8208;mountable healthcare devices. Importantly, to benefit most from these sensors, it is inevitable to use machine learning (ML) to process their output signals; with ML, a more accurate and efficient interpretation of original data is possible. This paper is dedicated to offering an overview of recent advances empowering the development of soft acoustic/ vibration sensors and their signal processing using ML. First, the key performance parameters of the sensors are discussed. Second, popular transduction mechanisms for the sensors are addressed, followed by an in&#8208;depth overview of each type, covering materials used, structural designs and sensing performances. Third, potential applications of the sensors are elaborated and fourth, a thorough discussion on ML is conducted, exploring different types of ML, specific ML algorithms suitable for processing acoustic/ vibration signals and current trends in ML&#8208;assisted applications. At last, the challenges and potential opportunities in soft acoustic/ vibration sensor and ML research are revealed to offer new insights into future prospects in these fields.

         <title>Fiber Crossbars: An Emerging Architecture of Smart Electronic Textiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Smart wearables have had a significant impact on people's daily lives, enabling personalized motion monitoring, realizing the Internet of Things (IoTs), and even reshaping the next generation of telemedicine systems. Fiber crossbars (FCs), constructed by crossing two fibers, have become an emerging architecture among the accessible structures of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art smart electronic textiles. The mechanical, chemical, and electrical interactions between crossing fibers result in extensive functionalities, leading to the significant development of innovative electronic textiles employing FCs as their basic units. This review provides a timely and comprehensive overview of the structure designs, material selections, and assembly techniques of FC&#8208;based devices. The recent advances in FC&#8208;based devices are summarized, including multipurpose sensing, multiple&#8208;mode computing, high&#8208;resolution display, high&#8208;efficient power supply, and large&#8208;scale textile systems. Finally, current challenges, potential solutions, and future perspectives for FC&#8208;based systems are discussed for their further development in scale&#8208;up production and commercial applications.

         <title>Photofunctional Scope of Fluorescent Dithienylethene Conjugates with Aza&#8208;Heteroaromatic Cations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A series of dithienylethene (DTE) photoswitches with aza&#8208;heteroaromatic cationic moieties was synthesized. The switches were characterized regarding their photochemical and photophysical properties in acetonitrile and in water. The efficiency of the switching and the photostationary state composition depend on the degree of &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the heteroaromatic systems. Thus, DTEs with acridinium&#8208;derived moieties have very low quantum yields for the ring&#8208;closing process, which is in contrast to switches with pyridinium and quinolinium moieties. All switches emit fluorescence in their open forms. The involved electronic transitions are traced back to an integrative picture including the DTE core and the cationic arms. The emission can be fine&#8208;tuned by the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the heteroaromatic cations, reaching the red spectral region for DTEs with acridinium moieties. On ring&#8208;closing of the DTEs the fluorescence was not observable anymore. Theoretical calculations point to rather low&#8208;lying energy levels of the highly conjugated ring&#8208;closed DTEs, which would originate near&#8208;infrared emission (&gt; 1200&#160;nm). The latter is predicted to be very weak due to the concurrent non&#8208;radiative deactivation, according to the energy&#8208;gap law. In essence, an ON&#8208;OFF fluorescence switching as the result of the electrocyclic ring&#8208;closing reaction is observed.

         <title>Modular Fabrication of Bioorthogonal Nanozymes for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The incorporation of transition metal catalysts (TMCs) into nanoscaffolds generates nanocatalysts that replicate key aspects of enzymatic behavior. The TMCs can access bioorthogonal chemistry unavailable to living systems. These bioorthogonal nanozymes can be employed as in situ &#8220;factories&#8221; for generating bioactive molecules where needed. The generation of effective bioorthogonal nanozymes requires co&#8208;engineering of the TMC and the nanometric scaffold. This review presents an overview of recent advances in the field of bioorthogonal nanozymes, focusing on modular design aspects of both nanomaterial and catalyst and how they synergistically work together for in situ uncaging of imaging and therapeutic agents.

         <title>Low&#8208;Grade Waste Heat Enabled Over 80 L M&#8208;2 H&#8210;1 Interfacial Steam Generation Based on 3d Superhydrophilic Foam</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Clean water scarcity and energy shortage have become urgent global problems due to population growth and human industrial development. Low&#8208;grade waste heat (LGWH) is a widely available and ubiquitous byproduct of human activities worldwide, which could provide an effective power to address the fresh water crisis without additional energy consumption and carbon emissions. In this regard, three&#8208;dimensional (3D) superhydrophilic polyurethane/sodium alginate (PU/SA) foam and the LGWH driven interfacial water evaporation system have been developed, which can precipitate over 80 L m&#8210;2 h&#8210;1 steam generation from seawater and has favorable durability for purification of high salinity wastewater. The excellent water absorption ability, unobstructed water transport and uniform thin water layer formed on 3D skeletons of PU/SA foam ensure the strong heat exchange between LGWH and fluidic water. As a result, the heat&#8208;localized PU/SA foam enables the efficient energy utilization and ultrafast water evaporation once LGWH is introduced into PU/SA foam as heat flow. In addition, the precipitated salt on PU/SA foam can be easily removed by mechanical compression, and almost no decrease in water evaporation rate after salt precipitation and removal for many times. Meanwhile, the collected clean water has high ions rejection of 99.6% that meets the World Health Organization (WHO) standard of drinking water. Above all, this LGWH driven interfacial water evaporation system presents a promising and easily accessible solution for clean water production and water&#8208;salt separation without additional energy burden for our society.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Area&#8208;selective Spatial Atomic Layer Deposition of SiO2 with Interleaved Small Molecule Inhibitors and Integrated Back&#8208;Etch Correction for Low Defectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A first&#8208;of&#8208;its&#8208;kind area&#8208;selective deposition process for SiO2&#160;is developed consisting of film deposition with interleaved exposures to small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) and back&#8208;etch correction steps, within the same spatial atomic layer deposition (ALD) tool. The synergy of these&#160;aspects results in selective SiO2&#160;deposition up to&#160;&#8764;23&#160;nm with high selectivity and throughput, with SiO2&#160;growth area and ZnO non&#8208;growth area. The selectivity is corroborated by both X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and low&#8208;energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEIS). The selectivity conferred by two different SMIs, ethylbutyric acid and pivalic acid, has been compared experimentally and theoretically. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that selective surface functionalization using both SMIs is thermodynamically controlled, while the better selectivity achieved when using trimethylacetic acid can be explained by its higher packing density&#160;compared to ethylbutyric acid. By employing the trimethylacetic acid as SMI on other starting surfaces (Ta2O5, ZrO2,&#160;etc.) and probing the selectivity, we demonstrate a broader use of carboxylic acid inhibitors for different substrates. We believe that the current results highlight the subtleties in SMI properties such as size, geometry and packing, as well as interleaved back&#8208;etch steps, which are key in developing ever more effective strategies for highly&#8208;selective deposition processes.

By employing the trimethylacetic acid as SMI on other starting surfaces (Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&#160;etc.) and probing the selectivity, we demonstrate a broader use of carboxylic acid inhibitors for different substrates. We believe that the current results highlight the subtleties in SMI properties such as size, geometry and packing, as well as interleaved back-etch steps, which are key in developing ever more effective strategies for highly-selective deposition processes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Quantum Dots Facilitate 3D Two&#8208;Photon Laser Lithography</title>

Abstract
In the past two decades, direct laser writing (DLW) technologies have seen tremendous growth. However, strategies that enhance the printing resolution and the development of printing material with assorted functionalities are still sparser than expected. In this paper, we present a cost&#8208;effective method to tackle this bottleneck. Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are selected to carry out this task, most importantly via surface chemistry modification to enable their co&#8208;polymerization with the monomers resulting in transparent composites. Our evaluations indicate that the QDs show great colloidal stability and their photoluminescent properties are well&#8208;preserved. This allows further exploration of the printing characteristics of such composite material. We show that in the presence of the QDs, the material provides a much lower polymerization threshold with faster linewidth growth, indicating that the QDs form a synergetic relationship with the monomer and the photoinitiator, widening the dynamic range of the material and thus increasing the writing efficiency for broader fields of applications. Lowering the polymerization threshold reduces the minimum achievable feature size by around 32%, which is well&#8208;matched with STED&#8208;based (i.e., stimulated&#8208;emission depletion microscopy) methods in writing 3D structures. We further elucidate the mechanism of the synergetic behavior, further guiding the future development of functional materials for DLW&#8208;related printing technologies.

         <title>Geometric and Electronic Engineering of Atomically Dispersed Copper&#8208;Cobalt Diatomic Sites for Synergistic Promoting Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalysis in Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

Abstract
The development of rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries is heavily dependent on bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts to offer exceptional oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) activities. However, the design of such electrocatalysts with high activity and durability is challenging. Herein, we propose a strategy to create an electrocatalyst comprised of copper&#8208;cobalt diatomic sites on a highly porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix (Cu&#8208;Co/NC) with abundantly accessible metal sites and optimal geometric and electronic structures. Experimental findings and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the synergistic effect of Cu&#8208;Co dual&#8208;metal sites with metal&#8208;N4 coordination induce asymmetric charge distributions with moderate adsorption/desorption behavior with oxygen intermediates. This electrocatalyst exhibited extraordinary bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic activities in alkaline media, with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.92&#160;V for ORR and a low overpotential of 335&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for OER. In addition, it demonstrated exceptional ORR activity in acidic (0.85&#160;V) and neutral (0.74&#160;V) media. When applied in zinc&#8208;air battery, it achieved extraordinary operational performance and outstanding durability (510&#160;h), ranking it as one of the most efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts reported to date. This work demonstrates the importance of geometric and electronic engineering of isolated dual&#8208;metal sites for boosting bifunctional electrocatalytic activity in electrochemical energy devices.

         <title>Conversion of Surface Residual Alkali to Solid Electrolyte to Enable Na&#8208;ion Full Cells with Robust Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The deposition of volatilized Na+ on the surface of the cathode during sintering results in the formation of surface residual alkali (NaOH/Na2CO3/NaHCO3) in layered cathode materials, leading to serious interfacial reactions and performance degradation. This phenomenon is particularly evident in O3&#8208;NaNi0.4Cu0.1Mn0.4Ti0.1O2 (NCMT). In this study, we propose a strategy to transform waste into treasure by converting residual alkali into a solid electrolyte. Mg(CH3COO)2 and H3PO4 are reacted with surface residual alkali to generate the solid electrolyte NaMgPO4 on the surface of NCMT, which can be labeled as NaMgPO4@NaNi0.4Cu0.1Mn0.4Ti0.1O2&#8208;X (NMP@NCMT&#8208;X, where X indicates the different amounts of Mg2+ and PO43&#8722;). NaMgPO4 acts as a special ionic conductivity channel on the surface to improve the kinetics of the electrode reactions, remarkably improving the rate capability of the modified cathode at a high current density in the half&#8208;cell. Additionally, NMP@NCMT&#8208;2 enables a reversible phase transition from the P3 to OP2 phase in the charge&#8211;discharge process above 4.2&#160;V and achieves a high specific capacity of 157.3 mAh g&#8722;1 and outstanding capacity retention in the full cell. The strategy can effectively and reliably stabilize the interface and improve the performance of layered cathodes for Na&#8208;ion batteries (NIBs).

         <title>Recent Advances in the Use of Covalent Organic Frameworks as Heterogenous Photocatalysts in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art development of pristine, functionalized, and hybrid covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for photocatalytic organic transformations is presented, arranged in a clear order that states the types of bonds in COFs that can be used in photocatalysis and the photocatalytic mechanisms behind these COFs which influence the performance of the applications.








Abstract
Organic photochemistry&#160;is&#160;intensely developed in the 1980s, in which the nature of excited electronic states and the energy and electron transfer processes are&#160;thoroughly studied and finally well&#8208;understood. This knowledge from molecular organic photochemistry can be transferred to the design of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as active visible&#8208;light photocatalysts. COFs constitute a new class of crystalline porous materials with substantial application potentials. Featured with outstanding structural tunability, large porosity, high surface area, excellent stability, and unique photoelectronic properties, COFs are studied as potential candidates in various research areas (e.g., photocatalysis). This review aims to provide the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art insights into the design of COF photocatalysts (pristine, functionalized, and hybrid COFs) for organic transformations. The catalytic reaction mechanism of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts and the influence of dimensionality and crystallinity on heterogenous photocatalysis performance are also discussed, followed by perspectives and prospects on the main challenges and opportunities in future research of COFs and COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Modulating Oxygen Vacancies in Lead Chromate for Photoelectrocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Although modulating oxygen vacancies in semiconductors has attracted broad interest in photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis, identifying the intrinsic roles of oxygen vacancies on photoelectrocatalytic properties is often elusive. Herein, we regulated the oxygen vacancies in a typical semiconductor lead chromate (PbCrO4) via controlling the oxygen chemical potentials of O&#8208;poor and O&#8208;rich post&#8208;annealing atmospheres. We identified that oxygen vacancies in PbCrO4 can introduce electronically shallow energy levels and deep energy levels owing to the symmetry difference of oxygen atoms in the structure. A higher population of deep energy levels created under O&#8208;poor atmosphere enables to induce the formation of more surface trapped states, resulting in a higher photovoltage for charge separation. Meanwhile, the existence of surface trapped states can significantly improve the charge injection efficiency of PbCrO4 photoanode and enhance the water oxidation activity. By modulating oxygen vacancies in PbCrO4 photoanode, it achieves a photocurrent density of 3.43&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#160;V versus RHE under simulated AM1.5G. Further passivation of surface trapped states and introducing water oxidation cocatalyst CoPi lead to a record applied bias photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency (ABPE) of 1.12%. This work provides a guide to understand the mechanism of oxygen vacancies in oxide&#8208;based semiconductor photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis.

Abstract
Achieving high catalytic performance through the lowest possible content of platinum (Pt) is the key to cost reduction of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). However, lowering the Pt loading in PEMFCs leads to high mass transport resistance of oxygen originated from the limited accessible active sites, and cause less stability of loaded ultrafine Pt nano&#8208;catalyst due to substantial size growth in long&#8208;term operations. Herein, we design new Pt&#8208;metal/metal&#8208;N&#8208;C aerogel catalyst that substantially reduces oxygen&#8208;related mass transport resistance and has long&#8208;term durability. The tailor of the Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C aerogel support with hierarchical and interconnecting pores enable a low local oxygen transport resistance (0.18 s/cm) for fuel cell with ultra&#8208;low Pt loading (50 &#177; 5&#160;&#956;g Pt/cm2). Chemical confinement of Fe&#8208;N sites in Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C aerogel ensure high stability of the loaded&#8208;Pt both in the processes of high temperature synthesis up to 1000&#176;C and practical application as fuel cell catalyst. The ultra&#8208;low Pt fuel cell displays a low voltage loss of 8&#160;mV at 0.80 A/cm2 and unchanged electrochemical surface area after 60, 000 cycles of accelerated durability test. The allied of hierarchical pore, aerogel and single atom can fully reflect their structural advantages and expand the understanding for the synthesis of advanced fuel cell catalysts.

         <title>Hydroiodic Acid Initiated Dense yet Porous Ti3C2Tx MXene Monoliths towards Superhigh Areal Energy Storage</title>

Abstract
The assembly of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) structured materials from two&#8208;dimensional (2D) units paves up a royal road for building thick and dense electrodes, which is the long pursuit for a practical energy storage device. 2D transitional metal carbides (MXene) make promises for this due to their capabilities of solution&#8208;based assembly and intrinsic high density, yet facing huge challenges in yielding high areal capacitance electrodes owing to the absence of porous ion transport paths. Here, a gelation&#8208;densification process initiated by hydroiodide acids (HI) is proposed, where the protons break the electrostatic balance of MXene nanosheets to trigger the gelation, while HI serves as the spacers to prevent nanosheets from restacking during the capillary shrinkage. More promising, the controlled evaporation of reductive HI leaves superiorly shrinking yet porous network for ion transport, and the produced monoliths exhibit a high density of 2.74&#160;g cm&#8722;3 and an unprecedented areal capacitance of 18.6 F cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Quad&#8208;Nanopore Array for High&#8208;resolution Single&#8208;Molecule Analysis and Discrimination</title>

Abstract
The ability to detect and distinguish biomolecules at the single&#8208;molecule level is at the forefront of today's biomedicine and analytical chemistry research. Increasing the dwell time of individual biomolecules in the sensing spot can greatly enhance the sensitivity of single&#8208;molecule methods. This is particularly important in solid&#8208;state nanopore sensing, where the detection of small molecules is often limited by the transit dwell time and insufficient temporal resolution. Here, we introduce a quad&#8208;nanopore, a square array of four nanopores (with a space interval of 30&#8211;50&#160;nm) to improve the detection sensitivity through electric field manipulation in the access region. We show that dwell times of short DNA strands (200&#160;bp) are prolonged in quad&#8208;nanopores as compared to single nanopores of the same diameter. We also investigated the dependence of dwell times on the quad&#8208;pore spacing and found that the &#8220;retarding effect&#8221; increases with decreasing space intervals. Furthermore, we demonstrate ultra&#8208;short DNA (50&#160;bp) detection using a 10&#160;nm diameter quad&#8208;nanopore array, which is hardly detected by a single nanopore. Finally, the general utility of quad&#8208;nanopores has been verified by successful discrimination of two kinds of small molecules, metal&#8208;organic cage and bovine serum albumin (BSA).

         <title>Bioinspired Self&#8208;standing, Self&#8208;floating 3D Solar Evaporators Breaking the Trade&#8208;off between Salt Cycle and Heat Localization for Continuous Seawater Desalination</title>

Abstract
Facing the global water shortage challenge, solar&#8208;driven desalination is considered as a sustainable technology to obtain freshwater from seawater. However, the trade&#8208;off between salt cycle and heat localization of existing solar evaporators (SE) hinders its further practical applications. Here, inspired by water hyacinth, a self&#8208;standing and self&#8208;floating 3D SE with adiabatic foam particles (FP) and aligned water channels was built through continuous directional freeze casting technique. With the help of the heat insulation effect of foam particles and the efficient water transport of aligned water channels, this new SE can cut off the heat transfer from the top photothermal area to the bulk water without affecting water supply, breaking the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off between salt cycle and heat localization of traditional SEs. Additionally, its self&#8208;standing and self&#8208;floating features can reduce human maintenance. Its large exposure height can increase evaporation area and collect environmental energy, breaking the long&#8208;standing limitation of solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapor efficiency of conventional SEs. With the novel structure employed, evaporation flux of 2.25&#8201;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, and solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapor efficiency of 136.7% are achieved under 1 sun illumination. This work demonstrates a new evaporator structure, and also provides a key insight for the structural design of next&#8208;generation salt&#8208;tolerant and high&#8208;efficiency solar evaporators.

         <title>Inducing Single Spin&#8208;polarized Flat Bands in Monolayer Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Due to the fundamental and technological implications in driving the appearance of non&#8208;trivial, exotic topological spin textures and emerging symmetry&#8208;broken phases, flat electronic bands in 2D materials, including graphene, are a hot topic in the field of spintronics. Here, via europium doping, we generate single&#8208;spin polarized bands in monolayer graphene supported by Co(0001) surface. The doping is controlled by Eu positioning, allowing for the formation of a K&#8208;valley localized single spin&#8208;polarized low&#8208;dispersive parabolic band close to Fermi energy when Eu is on top and a &#960;* flat band with single spin character when Eu is intercalated underneath graphene. In the latter case, Eu also induces a bandgap opening at the Dirac point while the Eu 4f states act as a spin filter, splitting the &#960; band into two spin&#8208;polarized branches. The generation of flat bands with single&#8208;spin character, as revealed by our spin&#8208; and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments, complemented by DFT calculations, opens up new pathways towards the realization of spintronic devices exploiting such novel exotic electronic and magnetic states.

Abstract
Zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) have drawn much attention as the next&#8208;generation energy storage for smart and wearable electronics due to their high theoretical gravimetric/volumetric energy capacities (820 mAh/g, 5855 mAh/cm3), safety from explosive hazards, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, at the current state, even the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ZIBs lack the energy capacity necessary to facilitate smart functionalities for intelligent electronics. In this work, a &#8220;&#960;&#8208;bridge spacer&#8221;&#8208;embedded electron donor&#8208;acceptor polymer cathode combined with Zn2+ ion&#8208;conducting gel electrolyte was proposed for a smart and flexible ZIB system to provide high electrochromic&#8208;electrochemical performances. The &#960;&#8208;bridge spacer endows the polymeric skeleton with improved physical ion accessibility and sensitive charge transfer along the charging&#8211;discharging cycles, providing extremely stable cyclability with high specific capacity (110 mAh/g) at very fast rates (8 A/g) and large coloration efficiency (79.8 cm2/C) under severe mechanical deformation over a long period (&#8764; 14 days). These results are markedly outstanding compared to the topological analogue without the &#960;&#8208;bridge spacer (80 mAh/g at current density of 8 A/g, 63.0 cm2/C). Our design to incorporate a &#960;&#8208;bridge spacer realizes notable electrochromism behaviors and high electrochemical performance in ZIBs, which sheds light on the rational development of multifunctional flexible&#8208;ZIBs with color visualization properties for widespread usage in powering smart electronics.

         <title>A Sulfur Heterocyclic Quinone Cathode towards High&#8208;Rate and Long&#8208;Cycle Aqueous Zn&#8208;organic Batteries</title>

Abstract
Organic materials have attracted much attention in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) due to their sustainability and structure&#8208;designable, but their further development is hindered by the high solubility, poor conductivity, and low utilization of active groups, resulting in poor cycling stability, terrible rate capability, and low capacity. In order to solve these three major obstacles, a novel organic host, benzo[b]naphtho[2&#8217;,3&#8217;:5,6][1,4]dithiino[2,3&#8208;i]thianthrene&#8208;5,7,9,14,16,18&#8208;hexone (BNDTH), with abundant electroactive groups and stable extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure has been synthesized and composited with RGO through a solvent exchange composition method to act as the cathode material for AZIBs. The well&#8208;designed BNDTH/reduced graphene oxide (BNDTH/RGO) composite exhibits a high capacity of 296 mAh g&#8722;1 (nearly a full utilization of the active groups), superior rate capability of 120 mAh g&#8722;1, and a long lifetime of 58000 cycles with a capacity retention of 65% at 10 A g&#8722;1. Even at a small current density of 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1, it is capable of cycling for 4680&#160;h with almost no attenuation of capacity. Such excellent performance can be attributed to the ingenious structural design of the active molecule, as well as the unique solvent exchange composition strategy enabled effective dispersion of excess charge on the active molecule during discharge/charge process. This work provides important insights for the rational design of organic cathode materials and has significant guidance for realizing ideal high performance in AZIBs.

         <title>Move Aside Pentacene: Diazapentacene&#8208;Doped para&#8208;Terphenyl, a Zero&#8208;Field Room&#8208;Temperature Maser with Strong Coupling for Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
6,13&#8208;Diazapentacene doped in para&#8208;terphenyl is discovered to act as a maser, the microwave analogue of lasers. As&#160;only the second material ever discovered to mase at room&#8208;temperature and zero external magnetic&#8208;field,&#160;optical and paramagnetic characterizations of this new material, to spearhead studies of maser materials for quantum sensors, magnetic spintronics, and tailored organic materials in optoelectronics, are presented.








Abstract
Masers can deliver ultralow&#8208;noise amplification of microwave signals in medical imaging and deep&#8208;space communication, with recent research being rekindled through the discovery of gain media operating at room&#8208;temperature, eschewing bulky cryogenics that hindered their use. This work shows the discovery of 6,13&#8208;diazapentacene doped in para&#8208;terphenyl (DAP:PTP) as a maser gain medium that can operate at room&#8208;temperature, without an external magnetic field. With a maser output power of &#8722;10 dBm, it is on par with pentacene&#8208;doped para&#8208;terphenyl in masing power, while possessing compelling advantages such as faster amplification startup times, being pumped by longer wavelength light at 620 nm and greater chemical stability from nitrogen groups. Furthermore, the maser bursts from DAP:PTP allow one to reach the strong coupling regime for cavity quantum electrodynamics, with a high&#160;cooperativity of 182. The optical and microwave spin dynamics of DAP:PTP are studied in order to evaluate its capabilities as a maser gain medium, where it features fast intersystem crossing and an advantageously higher triplet quantum yield. The results pave the way for the future discovery of similar maser materials and help designate them as promising candidates for quantum sensors, optoelectronic devices and the study of cavity quantum electrodynamic effects at&#160;room&#8208;temperature.

         <title>Plant&#8208;Derived Vesicle&#8208;Like Nanoparticles as Promising Biotherapeutic Tools: Present and Future</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plant&#8208;derived vesicle&#8208;like nanoparticles (PDVLNs) is a general term for vesicle&#8208;like nanostructure particles isolated from plants, which can be developed as therapeutic agents and drug carriers for their low immunogenicity and wide availability. PDVLNs have promising potential in human health and disease treatments. It is necessary to further develop standard operating procedures to promote the clinical application of PDVLNs.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are heterogeneous, phospholipid bilayer&#8208;enclosed biological particles that regulate cell communication by molecular cargo delivery and surface signaling. EVs are secreted by almost all living cells, including plant cells. Plant&#8208;derived vesicle&#8208;like nanoparticles (PDVLNs) is a generic term referring to vesicle&#8208;like nanostructure particles isolated from plants. Their low immunogenicity and wide availability make PDVLNs safer and more economical to be developed as therapeutic agents and drug carriers. Accumulating evidence indicates the key roles of PDVLNs in regulating interkingdom crosstalk between humans and plants. PDVLNs are capable of entering the human&#8208;body systemand delivering effector molecules to cells that modulate cell&#8208;signaling pathways. PDVLNs released by or obtained from plants thus have great influenceon human health and diseases. In this review, the biogenesis, detailed preparation methods, various physical and biochemical characteristics, biosafety, and preservation of PDVLNs are introduced, along with how these characteristics pertain to their biosafety and preservability. The potential applications of PDVLNs on different plant and mammalian diseases and PDVLN research standardization are then systematically discussed.

         <title>Precise Control of Single&#8208;Crystal Perovskite Nanolasers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Efficient control of integrated light sources is crucial to advancing practical applications of nanophotonics. Despite the successes of microlasers, their sophisticated nanostructures are inapplicable to nanolasers. The situation for bottom&#8208;up synthesized nanolasers becomes more challenging due to the constraints of fixed cavity shapes and fragile material stability. Here we employ the physics of exceptional points (EPs) and demonstrate a strategy to precisely tune the lasing actions in lead halide perovskite nanorods. By placing a nanoparticle to the boundary of a square nanocavity, we show that EPs regularly and controllably emerge as a function of the nanoparticle position. Consequently, both the internal lasing actions and their far&#8208;field radiation can be completely reversed with a tiny displacement &lt; 100&#160;nm. The new strategy for controlling lasing actions in nanocavities has been confirmed with numerical simulations and lasing experiments. This research can also bring new avenues for ultrasensitive position sensing.

         <title>Understanding the Interfacial Reactions and Band Alignment for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells Built on Metal Substrates with Reduced Up&#8208;scaling Losses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Conventional perovskite solar cells (PSC) built on transparent&#8208;conductive&#8208;oxide (TCO) glass face a fundamental challenge to retain fill factor (FF) for large&#8208;area up&#8208;scaling due to series resistance loss. Building a perovskite solar cell on metal has the potential to reduce this FF loss and is promising for flexible applications. However, their efficiency and stability lag far behind their TCO counterparts. Herein we report our findings on (i) the complex chemical reactions and degradation&#8208;promoting processes at different perovskite/metal (Cu, Au, Ag, and Mo) interfaces, which are closely linked with the inherent stability; and (ii) the interlayer engineering for perovskite/metal interface's band alignment, which plays an essential role in achieving high efficiency. Leveraging these findings, we achieve 21% power&#8208;conversion&#8208;efficiency (PCE) for 1&#8208;cm[2] perovskite solar cells using a p&#8208;i&#8208;n top&#8208;illumination structure on a molybdenum substrate, the highest reported for a PSC built on metal. Notably, the FF and PCE losses due to area up&#8208;scaling are remarkably reduced by one order of magnitude relative to the counterparts on conventional TCO glass, highlighting an alternative pathway for PSC up&#8208;scaling and module design.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional perovskite solar cells (PSC) built on transparent-conductive-oxide (TCO) glass face a fundamental challenge to retain fill factor (FF) for large-area up-scaling due to series resistance loss. Building a perovskite solar cell on metal has the potential to reduce this FF loss and is promising for flexible applications. However, their efficiency and stability lag far behind their TCO counterparts. Herein we report our findings on (i) the complex chemical reactions and degradation-promoting processes at different perovskite/metal (Cu, Au, Ag, and Mo) interfaces, which are closely linked with the inherent stability; and (ii) the interlayer engineering for perovskite/metal interface's band alignment, which plays an essential role in achieving high efficiency. Leveraging these findings, we achieve 21% power-conversion-efficiency (PCE) for 1-cm&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;/sup&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; perovskite solar cells using a p-i-n top-illumination structure on a molybdenum substrate, the highest reported for a PSC built on metal. Notably, the FF and PCE losses due to area up-scaling are remarkably reduced by one order of magnitude relative to the counterparts on conventional TCO glass, highlighting an alternative pathway for PSC up-scaling and module design.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Versatile Host Materials for Both D&#8208;A type and Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emitters towards Solution&#8208;Processed OLEDs with Nearly 30% EQE</title>

Abstract
Solution&#8208;processible host material for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitter remains a formidable challenge for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this work, two new host materials, namely 3CzAcPy and 9CzAcPy, exhibit high triplet energy levels, high thermal stability, and excellent film morphology from solution process. An in&#8208;depth analysis on the photophysical data and device performance reveals the isomeric effect of host materials has a significant impact not only on the host properties, but also on the host&#8208;dopant interactions and thus the performance of solution&#8208;processed TADF OLEDs. Impressively, the new hosts are proven to be suitable for both donor&#8208;acceptor type and multi&#8208;resonance TADF emitters, achieving state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device performance. Using the new host 9CzAcPy, solution&#8208;processed OLED based on a donor&#8208;acceptor TADF emitter of DPAC&#8208;PCN achieves a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 29.5%, and solution&#8208;processed narrowband OLED based on a multiple&#8208;resonance TADF emitter of BN&#8208;CP1 acquires a maximum EQE of 26.6%. These efficiencies represent the highest values among the solution&#8208;processed TADF OLEDs. This study highlights the significance of host&#8208;dopant interactions in modulating the electroluminescence performance of TADF emitters, and provides an effective design principle for solution&#8208;processible host materials.

         <title>Expanding Embedded 3D Bioprinting Capability for Engineering Complex Organs with Freeform Vascular Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In vitro replication of the external geometry of specific organs and their internal structures simultaneously remains one of the greatest challenges in the biofabrication field. This study introduces a generalizable bioprinting strategy of sequential printing in a reversible ink template (SPIRIT) to address this limitation. Moreover, the SPIRIT technique significantly reduces the printing time compared to conventional bioprinting strategies.








Abstract
Creating functional tissues and organs in vitro on demand is a major goal in biofabrication, but the ability to replicate the external geometry of specific organs and their internal structures such as blood vessels simultaneously remains one of the greatest impediments. Here, this limitation is addressed by developing a generalizable bioprinting strategy of sequential printing in a reversible ink template (SPIRIT). It is demonstrated that this microgel&#8208;based biphasic (MB) bioink can be used as both an excellent bioink and a suspension medium that supports embedded 3D printing due to its shear&#8208;thinning and self&#8208;healing behavior. When encapsulating human&#8208;induced pluripotent stem cells, the MB bioink is 3D printed to generate cardiac tissues and organoids by extensive stem cell proliferation and cardiac differentiation. By incorporating MB bioink, the SPIRIT strategy enables the effective printing of a ventricle model with a perfusable vascular network, which is not possible to fabricate using extant 3D printing strategies. This SPIRIT technique offers an unparalleled bioprinting capability to replicate the complex organ geometry and internal structure in a faster manner, which will accelerate the biofabrication and therapeutic applications of tissue and organ constructs.

         <title>Reversing Acute Kidney Injury Through Coordinated Interplay of Anti&#8208;inflammation and Iron Supplementation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Acute kidney injury (AKI) induced by ischemia reperfusion is closely related to mitochondrial dysfunction. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) can enhance the mitochondrial function and restrain the following inflammation, but it is hardly delivered and lacks renal targeting ability. To address these problems, we herein use an ultra&#8208;small Fe3O4 nanoparticle as a carrier to deliver nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a precursor of NAD+. An outstanding sophistication of the current design is that once NMN is attached on the surface of Fe3O4 nanoparticles through its phosphate group, the remaining part is structurally highly similar to nicotinamide riboside, which provides an opportunity to deliver the NAD+ precursor into renal cells through nicotinamide riboside kinase 1 on cell membrane. It was demonstrated that NMN&#8208;loaded Fe3O4 nanoparticles can effectively reverse AKI induced by ischemia reperfusion. In&#8208;depth studies indicated that a well&#8208;timed iron replenishment following anti&#8208;inflammation treatment plays a determined role in recovering AKI, which distinguishes the current study from previously strategies centering on anti&#8208;ROS (reactive oxygen species), anti&#8208;inflammation or even iron elimination.

         <title>Physicochemical Dual Crosslinking Conductive Polymeric Networks Combining High Strength and High Toughness Enable Stable Operation of Silicon Microparticles Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The poor interfacial stability and insufficient cycle performance caused by the undesirable stress hinder the commercial application of silicon microparticles (&#956;Si), as next&#8208;generation anode materials for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8211;ion batteries. Herein, we design a conceptionally novel physicochemical dual crosslinking conductive polymeric network combining with high strength and high toughness by coupling stiffness of polyacrylic acid and softness of carboxyl nitrile rubber, which includes multiple H&#8208;bonds by introducing highly branched tannic acid, as physical cross&#8208;linker. Such a design enables effective stress dissipation by folded molecular chains slipping and sequential H&#8208;bonds cleavage, thus stabilize the electrode interface and enhance cycle stability. As expected, the resultant electrode (&#956;Si/PTBR) delivers an unprecedented high capacity retention of &#8764; 97% from 2027.9 mAh g&#8722;1 at 19th to 1945.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 200th cycle at 2 A g&#8722;1. Meanwhile, this unique stress dissipation strategy is also suitable for stablizing SiOx anodes with much low capacity loss of &#8764; 0.012% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1.5 A g&#8722;1. Atomic force microscopy analysis and finite element simulations reveal the excellent stress distribution ability of physicochemical dual crosslinking conductive polymeric network. This work provides an efficient energy dissipation strategy towards practical high&#8208;capacity anodes for energy&#8208;dense batteries.

         <title>A microbial community cultured in gradient hydrogel for investigating gut microbiome&#8208;drug interaction and guiding therapeutic decisions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Despite the recognition that the gut microbiota acts a clinically significant role in cancer chemotherapy, both mechanistic understanding, and translational research are still limited. Maximizing drug efficacy requires an in&#8208;depth understanding of how the microbiota contributes to therapeutic responses, while, microbiota modulation is hindered by the complexity of the human body. To address this issue, we report a 3D experimental model named engineered microbiota (EM) for bridging microbiota&#8208;drug interaction research and therapeutic decision&#8208;making. EM can be manipulated in vitro and faithfully recapitulate the human gut microbiota at the genus/species level while allowing co&#8208;culture with cells, organoids, and isolated tissues for testing drug responses. Examination of various clinical and experimental drugs by EM revealed that the gut microbiota affects drug efficacy through three pathways: immunological effects, bioaccumulation, and drug metabolism. Guided by discovered mechanisms, we adopted custom&#8208;tailored strategies to maximize the therapeutic efficacy of drugs on orthotopic tumor models with patient&#8208;derived gut microbiota. These strategies included immune synergy, nanoparticle encapsulation, and host&#8208;guest complex formation, respectively. Given the important role of the gut microbiota in influencing drug efficacy, EM will likely become an indispensable tool to guide drug translation and clinical decision&#8208;making.

&lt;p&gt;Despite the recognition that the gut microbiota acts a clinically significant role in cancer chemotherapy, both mechanistic understanding, and translational research are still limited. Maximizing drug efficacy requires an in-depth understanding of how the microbiota contributes to therapeutic responses, while, microbiota modulation is hindered by the complexity of the human body. To address this issue, we report a 3D experimental model named engineered microbiota (EM) for bridging microbiota-drug interaction research and therapeutic decision-making. EM can be manipulated in vitro and faithfully recapitulate the human gut microbiota at the genus/species level while allowing co-culture with cells, organoids, and isolated tissues for testing drug responses. Examination of various clinical and experimental drugs by EM revealed that the gut microbiota affects drug efficacy through three pathways: immunological effects, bioaccumulation, and drug metabolism.

         <title>Supported Ruthenium Single&#8208;Atom and Clustered Catalysts Outperform Benchmark Pt for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Guaranteeing satisfactory catalytic behavior while ensuring high metal utilization has become the problem that needs to be addressed when designing noble metal based catalysts for electrochemical reactions. Here, the well&#8208;dispersed ruthenium (Ru) based clusters with adjacent Ru single atoms (SAs) on layered sodium cobalt oxide (Ru/NC) is demonstrated to be a superb electrocatalyst for alkaline HER. The Ru/NC catalyst manifests an activity increase by a factor of two relative to the commercial Pt/C. Operando characterizations in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT) simulations uncover the origin of the superior activity and establish a structure&#8208;performance relationship, that is, under HER condition, the real active species are Ru SAs and metallic Ru clusters supported on the NC substrate. The excellent alkaline HER activity of the Ru/NC catalyst can be understood by a spatially decoupled water dissociation and hydrogen desorption mechanism, where the NC substrate accelerates the water dissociation rate, and the generated H intermediates would then migrate to the Ru SAs or clusters and recombine to have H2 evolution. More importantly, comparing the two forms of Ru sites, it is the Ru cluster that dominates the HER activity.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Stimuli Responsive and Mechano&#8208;Actuated Biomimetic Membrane Nanopores Self&#8208;Assembled from DNA</title>

Abstract
In bio&#8208;inspired design, biological templates are being mimicked in structure and function with highly controllable synthetic means. Static barrel&#8208;like nanopores have been created to enable molecular transport across membranes for use in biosensing, sequencing, and biotechnology. Biological ion channels offer more functions such as dynamic changes of the entire pore shape between open and closed states, and the triggering of the dynamic process with biochemical and physical stimuli. To better capture this complexity, w e have created multi&#8208;stimuli and mechanoresponsive biomimetic channels with DNA nanotechnology. O ur nanopores switch between open and closed states, whereby specific binding of DNA and protein molecules as stimuli locks the pores in the open state. Furthermore, the physical stimulus of high transmembrane voltage switches the pores into a closed state. In addition, the pore diameters are larger and more tuneable than those of the natural templates. O ur multi&#8208;stimuli responsive and mechanically actuated nanopores mimic several aspects of complex biological channels yet offer easier control over pore size, shape and stimulus response. W e expect the designer pores to be applied in biosensing and synthetic biology.

         <title>Interstitial Segregation has the Potential to Mitigate Liquid Metal Embrittlement in Iron</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The embrittlement of metallic alloys by liquid metals leads to catastrophic material failure and severely impacts their structural integrity. The weakening of grain boundaries by the ingress of liquid metal and preceding segregation in the solid are thought to promote early fracture. However, the potential of balancing between the segregation of cohesion&#8208;enhancing interstitial solutes and embrittling elements inducing grain boundary decohesion is not understood. Here, we unveil the mechanisms of how boron segregation mitigates the detrimental effects of the prime embrittler, zinc, in a &#931;5&#8201;[0&#8201;0&#8201;1] tilt grain boundary in &#945; &#8722;Fe (4 at.% Al). Zinc forms nanoscale segregation patterns inducing structurally and compositionally complex grain boundary states. Ab&#8208;initio simulations reveal that boron hinders zinc segregation and compensates for the zinc induced loss in grain boundary cohesion. Our work sheds new light on how interstitial solutes intimately modify grain boundaries, thereby opening pathways to use them as dopants for preventing disastrous material failure.

         <title>Direct observation of quadrupolar strain fields surrounding Eshelby inclusions in metallic glasses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
For decades, scanning/transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM) techniques have been employed to analyze shear bands in metallic glasses and understand their formation in order to improve the mechanical properties of metallic glasses. However, due to a lack of direct information in reciprocal space, conventional S/TEM cannot characterize the local strain and atomic structure of amorphous materials, which are key to describe the deformation of glasses. For this work, we applied 4&#8208;dimensional STEM to map and directly correlate the local strain and the atomic structure at the nanometer scale in deformed metallic glasses. We observe residual strain fields with quadrupolar symmetry concentrated at dilated Eshelby inclusions. The strain fields percolate in a vortex&#8208;like manner building up the shear band. This provides a new understanding of the formation of shear bands in metallic glass.

         <title>Soft Functionally Gradient Materials and Structures &#8211; Natural and Manmade: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Functionally gradient materials (FGM) have gradual variations in their properties along one or more dimensions due to local compositional or structural distinctions by design. Traditionally, hard materials (e.g., metals, ceramics) have been used to design and fabricate FGMs; however, there has been increasing interest in polymer&#8208;based soft and compliant FGMs mainly because of their potential application in the human environment. Soft FGMs are not only ideally suitable to manage interfacial problems in dissimilar materials used in many emerging devices and systems for human interaction, such as soft robotics and electronic textiles and beyond. Soft systems are ubiquitous in our everyday lives; they are resilient and can easily deform, absorb energy and adapt to changing environments. Here, we discuss the basic design and functional principles of biological FGMs and their manmade counterparts using representative examples. The remarkable multifunctional properties of natural FGMs resulting from their sophisticated hierarchical structures, built from a relatively limited choice of materials, offer a rich source of new design paradigms and manufacturing strategies for manmade materials and systems for emerging technological needs. Finally, we highlight the challenges and potential pathways to leverage soft materials' facile processability and unique properties to wards functional FGMs.

         <title>Defect&#8208;enriched Hollow Porous Carbon Nanocages Enable Highly Efficient Chlorine Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based catalyst is crucial for electrocatalytic chlorine evolution reaction (CER) to reduce the usage of noble metal and industrial cost. However, the corresponded catalytic activity of high overpotential and low durability hinders their wide application. Here, we firstly report a hollow porous carbon (HPC) nanocage with controlled oxygen electronic state around designed carbon defects for CER activity. Alkali etching can bring defects in zeolite with hollow structure. In a hard template strategy, the type of carbon defects is directly related to etching degree of the zeolite template. More importantly, the oxygen atoms can be &#8220;borrowed&#8221; from zeolite framework to defective carbon. The electron density around unsaturated O atoms can be decreased on the minor defects in carbon compared with that on large defects which is favorable for the adsorption of Cl&#8722;. Consequently, the as&#8208;synthesized HPC nanacages with minor defects show excellent electrocatalytic performance for CER with a low overpotential of 94&#160;mV at current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with good stability, which is superior to the commercial precious metal catalyst of DSA, and the best in the reported carbon materials. Our designed carbon materials provide an option for metal&#8208;free industrial catalysts with significant CER activities.

Here, we firstly report a hollow porous carbon (HPC) nanocage with controlled oxygen electronic state around designed carbon defects for CER activity. Alkali etching can bring defects in zeolite with hollow structure. In a hard template strategy, the type of carbon defects is directly related to etching degree of the zeolite template. More importantly, the oxygen atoms can be &#8220;borrowed&#8221; from zeolite framework to defective carbon. The electron density around unsaturated O atoms can be decreased on the minor defects in carbon compared with that on large defects which is favorable for the adsorption of Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. Consequently, the as-synthesized HPC nanacages with minor defects show excellent electrocatalytic performance for CER with a low overpotential of 94&#160;mV at current density of 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with good stability, which is superior to the commercial precious metal catalyst of DSA, and the best in the reported carbon materials. Our designed carbon materials provide an option for metal-free industrial catalysts with significant CER activities.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
A new set of pyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based (PPr) polymers incorporated with thioalkylated/alkylated bithiophene (SBT/BT) were synthesized and explored as hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) for Sn&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs). Three bithiophenyl spacers bearing the thioalkylated hexyl (SBT&#8208;6), thioalkylated tetradecyl (SBT&#8208;14), and tetradecyl (BT&#8208;14) chains were utilized to examine the effect of the alkyl chain lengths. Among them, the TPSCs were fabricated using PPr&#8208;SBT&#8208;14 as HTMs through a two&#8208;step approach by attaining a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.6% with a remarkable long&#8208;term stability beyond 6000 hours, which has not been reported elsewhere for a non&#8208;PEDOT:PSS&#8208;based TPSC. The PPr&#8208;SBT&#8208;14 device was stable under light irradiation for 5 hours in air (50% relative humidity) at the maximum power point (MPP). The highly planar structure, strong intramolecular S(alkyl)&#183;&#183;&#183;S(thiophene) interactions, and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation of SBT made the PPr&#8208;SBT&#8208;14 device outperform the standard P3HT and other devices. The longer thio&#8208;tetradecyl chain in SBT&#8208;14 restricts the molecular rotation and strongly affects the molecular conformation, solubility, and film wettability over other polymers. Thus, the present study makes a promising dopant&#8208;free polymeric HTM model for the future design of highly efficient and stable TPSCs.

         <title>Rapid and Scalable Transfer of Large&#8208;area Graphene Wafers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Recently, scalable production of large&#8208;area graphene films on metal foils with promising qualities has been successfully achieved by eliminating grain boundaries, wrinkles and adlayers. The transfer of graphene from growth metal substrates onto functional substrates remains one inescapable obstacle on the road to the real commercial applications of CVD graphene films. Current transfer methods still require time&#8208;consuming chemical reactions, which hinders its mass production, and produces cracks and contamination that strongly impede performance reproducibility. Therefore, graphene transfer techniques with fine intactness and cleanness of transferred graphene, and improved production efficiency would be ideal for the mass production of graphene films on destination substrates. Herein, through the engineering of interfacial forces enabled by sophisticated design of transfer medium, we realize the crack&#8208;free and clean transfer of 4&#8208;inch&#8208;sized graphene wafers onto silicon wafers within only 15&#160;min. The reported transfer method is an important leap over the long&#8208;lasting obstacle of the batch&#8208;scale graphene transfer without degrading the quality of graphene, bringing the graphene products close to the real applications.

         <title>A Highly Robust Amphibious Soft Robot with Imperceptibility Based on a Water&#8208;stable and Self&#8208;healing Ionic Conductor</title>

Abstract
Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are widely exploited for actuating soft machines and granting soft robots with capability to operate in both underwater and on&#8208;land environments is important to make them adapt to more complex situations. Here, we presenteded a DEA&#8208;driven, highly robust, amphibious imperceptible soft robot (AISR) based on an all&#8208;environment stable ionic conductive material. We developed a soft, self&#8208;healable, all&#8208;environment stable ionic conductor by introducing cooperative ion&#8208;dipole interactions to provide underwater stability as well as efficient suppression of ion penetration. By tuning molecular structures of the material, we achieved a 50&#8208;time device lifetime increase compared with unmodified [EMI][TFSI]&#8208;based devices and excellent underwater actuating performance. With the synthesized ionic electrode, our DEA&#8208;driven soft robot exhibited amphibious functionality to traverse hydro&#8208;terrestrial regions. When encountering the damages, the robot showed good damage resilience and could self&#8208;heal underwater and it also exhibited imperceptibility to light, sound and heat.

         <title>Achieving Practical High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Lithium Metal Batteries by a Dual&#8208;Anion Regulated Electrolyte</title>

Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) using lithium metal anodes and high&#8208;voltage cathodes have been deemed as one of the most promising high&#8208;energy&#8208;density battery technology. However, its practical application is largely hindered by the notorious dendrite growth of lithium metal anode, fast structure degradation of cathode and insufficient electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase kinetics. Here, a solvation structure regulation strategy is developed for LMBs using lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and lithium difluoro(bisoxalato)phosphate (LiDFBOP) as anion regulators. The incorporation of TFSI&#8722; in the solvation sheath reduces the desolvation energy of Li+, and DFBOP&#8722; promotes the formation of high ion&#8208;conductive and sustainable inorganic&#8208;rich interphases on electrodes. Significantly enhanced performance is demonstrated on Li||LiNi0.83Co0.11Mn0.06O2 pouch cells, with 84.6% capacity retention after 150 cycles in 6.0 Ah pouch cells and an ultra&#8208;high rate capability up to 5 C in 2.0 Ah pouch cells. Furthermore, a pouch cell with an ultra&#8208;large capacity of 39.0 Ah is fabricated and achieves an ultra&#8208;high energy density of 521.3&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. Our findings provide a facile electrolyte design strategy for promoting the practical utilization of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LMBs.

         <title>Managing Interfacial Defects and Carriers by Synergistic Modulation of Functional Groups and Spatial Conformation for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Photovoltaics based on Vacuum Flash Method</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Interfacial nonradiative recombination loss is a huge barrier to advance the photovoltaic performance. Here, we propose one effective interfacial defect and carrier dynamics management strategy by synergistic modulation of functional groups and spatial conformation of ammonium salt molecules. The surface treatment with 3&#8208;ammonium propionic acid iodide (3&#8208;APAI) does not form 2D perovskite passivation layer while the propylammonium ions and 5&#8208;aminopentanoic acid hydroiodide post&#8208;treatment lead to the formation of 2D perovskite passivation layers. Due to appropriate alkyl chain length, theoretical and experimental results manifest that &#8208;COOH and &#8208;NH3+ groups in 3&#8208;APAI molecules can form coordination bonding with undercoordinated Pb2+ and ionic bonding and hydrogen bonding with octahedron PbI64&#8722;, respectively, which makes both groups be simultaneously firmly anchored on the surface of perovskite films. This would strengthen defect passivation effect and improve interfacial carrier transport and transfer. The synergistic effect of functional groups and spatial conformation confers 3&#8208;APAI better defect passivation effect than 2D perovskite layers. The 3&#8208;APAI modified device based on vacuum flash technology achieves an alluring peak efficiency of 24.72% (certified 23.68%), which is among highly efficient devices fabricated without antisolvents. Furthermore, the encapsulated 3&#8208;APAI&#8208;modified device degrades by less than 4% after 1400&#160;h of continuous one sun illumination.

The surface treatment with 3-ammonium propionic acid iodide (3-APAI) does not form 2D perovskite passivation layer while the propylammonium ions and 5-aminopentanoic acid hydroiodide post-treatment lead to the formation of 2D perovskite passivation layers. Due to appropriate alkyl chain length, theoretical and experimental results manifest that -COOH and -NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Walking Ferroelectric Liquid Droplets with Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The motion of ferroelectric liquid dropletson a ferroelectric solid substrate is controlled by a light beam of moderate intensity. Upon entering the ferroelectric phase, droplets are either attracted toward the center of the beam or repelled, depending on which side of the ferroelectric substrate is exposed to light. Moving the beam results in walking the ferroelectric droplet over long distances on the substrate.








Abstract
The motion of ferroelectric liquid sessile droplets deposited on a ferroelectric lithium niobate substrate can be controlled by a light beam of moderate intensity irradiating the substrate at a distance of several droplet diameters from the droplet itself. The ferroelectric liquid is a nematic liquid crystal, in which almost complete polar ordering of the molecular dipoles generates an internal macroscopic polarization locally collinear to the mean molecular long axis. Upon entering the ferroelectric phase, droplets are either attracted toward the center of the beam or repelled, depending on the side of the lithium niobate exposed to light irradiation. Moreover, moving the beam results in walking the ferroelectric droplet over long distances on the substrate. This behavior is understood as due to the coupling between the polarization of the ferroelectric droplet and the polarization photoinduced in the irradiated region of the lithium niobate substrate. Indeed, the effect is not observed in the conventional nematic phase, suggesting the crucial role of the ferroelectric liquid crystal polarization.

         <title>Achieving Tunable Organic Afterglow and UV Irradiation&#8208;Responsive Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Pyridine&#8208;Substituted Triphenylamine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Amorphous polymers with ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are highly promising for various applications. Particularly, polymer&#8208;based RTP materials with multiple functions such as color&#8208;tunability or stimulus&#8208;responsiveness are highly desirable for multilevel anti&#8208;counterfeiting but are rarely reported. Herein, we present a facile strategy to achieve a series of polymer&#8208;based RTP materials with ultralong lifetime, multicolor afterglow, and reversible response to UV irradiation by simply embedding pyridine&#8208;substituted triphenylamine derivatives into the polymer matrix poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), respectively. Notably, the pyridine group with the capabilities of promoting intersystem crossing and forming hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions is essential for triggering ultralong RTP from the doping PVA system, among which the doping film TPA&#8208;2Py@PVA exhibits excellent RTP property with an ultralong lifetime of 798.4&#160;ms and a high quantum yield of 15.2%. By further co&#8208;doping with the commercially available fluorescent dye, multicolor afterglow is obtained via phosphorescence energy transfer. While the doping PMMA system exhibits reversible photo&#8208;activated ultralong RTP properties under continuous UV irradiation. Finally, we demonstrate potential applications of these doping PVA and PMMA systems with ultralong lifetime, multicolor afterglow, and photo&#8208;activated ultralong RTP in multi&#8208;dimensional anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Unconventional Giant &#8220;Magnetoresistance&#8221; in Bosonic Semiconducting Diamond Nanorings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoscale &#8220;diamond rings&#8221; provide unconventional giant &#8220;magnetoresistance&#8221; for the development of new quantum devices. The unconventional giant &#8220;magnetoresistance&#8221; caused by the trapping of Cooper pairs within the heavily boron&#8208;doped diamond nanorings, distinguishes itself from the conventional giant magnetoresistance originating from spin&#8208;dependent scattering of single electrons in layered magnetic materials.








Abstract
The emergence of superconductivity in doped insulators such as cuprates and pnictides coincides with their doping&#8208;driven insulator&#8211;metal transitions. Above the critical doping threshold, a metallic state sets in at high temperatures, while superconductivity sets in at low temperatures. An unanswered question is whether the formation of Cooper pairsin a well&#8208;established metal will inevitably transform the host material into a superconductor, as manifested by a resistance drop. Here, this question is addressed by investigating the electrical transport in nanoscale rings (full loops) and half loops manufactured from heavily boron&#8208;doped diamond. It is shown that in contrast to the diamond half&#8208;loops (DHLs) exhibiting a metal&#8211;superconductor transition, the diamond nanorings (DNRs) demonstrate a sharp resistance increase up to 430% and a giant negative &#8220;magnetoresistance&#8221; below the superconducting transition temperature of the starting material. The finding of the unconventional giant negative &#8220;magnetoresistance&#8221;, as distinct from existing categories of magnetoresistance, that is, the conventional giant magnetoresistance&#160;in magnetic multilayers, the colossal magnetoresistance&#160;in perovskites, and the geometric magnetoresistance in semiconductor&#8211;metal hybrids, reveals the transformation of the DNRs from metals to bosonic semiconductors upon the formation of Cooper pairs. DNRs like these could be used to manipulate Cooper pairs in superconducting quantum devices.

         <title>Launching and Manipulation of Higher&#8208;Order In&#8208;Plane Hyperbolic Phonon Polaritons in Low&#8208;Dimensional Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly confined, directionally dependent in&#8208;plane hyperbolic light propagation is demonstrated in a heterostructure composed of a 3C&#8208;SiC nanowire on &#945;&#8208;MoO3 flake. Such low&#8208;dimensional heterostructure showcases the efficient and precise manipulation of the extremely anisotropic light&#8208;matter interactions at the deeply subwavelength scale, opening opportunities for a wide range of IR applications.








Abstract
Hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs) are stimulated by coupling infrared (IR) photons with the polar lattice vibrations. Such HPhPs offer low&#8208;loss, highly confined light propagation at subwavelength scales with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane or in&#8208;plane hyperbolic wavefronts. For HPhPs, while a hyperbolic dispersion implies multiple propagating modes with a distribution of wavevectors at a given frequency, so far it has been challenging to experimentally launch and probe the higher&#8208;order modes that offer stronger wavelength compression, especially for in&#8208;plane HPhPs. In this work, the experimental observation of higher&#8208;order in&#8208;plane HPhP modes stimulated on a 3C&#8208;SiC nanowire (NW)/&#945;&#8208;MoO3 heterostructure is reported where leveraging both the low&#8208;dimensionality and low&#8208;loss nature of the polar NWs, higher&#8208;order HPhPs modes within 2D &#945;&#8208;MoO3 crystal are launched by the 1D 3C&#8208;SiC NW. The launching mechanism is further studied and the requirements for efficiently launching of such higher&#8208;order modes are determined. In addition, by altering the geometric orientation between the 3C&#8208;SiC NW and &#945;&#8208;MoO3 crystal, the manipulation of higher&#8208;order HPhP dispersions as a method of tuning is demonstrated. This work illustrates an extremely anisotropic low dimensional heterostructure platform to confine and configure electromagnetic waves at the deep&#8208;subwavelength scales for a range of IR applications including sensing, nano&#8208;imaging, and on&#8208;chip photonics.

         <title>Advances in Solution&#8208;Processed OLEDs and their Prospects for Use in Displays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The industrial demands for commercial solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diode (SOLED) displays are outlined, along with the current status of SOLEDs in industry and academia. For their practical use in displays, technical challenges and directions of research and development in SOLEDs to achieve high efficiency, long lifetime, and good processability are reviewed.








Abstract
This review outlines problems and progress in development of solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (SOLEDs) in industry and academia. Solution processing has several advantages such as low consumption of materials, low&#8208;cost processing, and large&#8208;area manufacturing. However, use of a solution process entails complications, such as the need for solvent resistivity and solution&#8208;processable materials, and yields SOLEDs that have limited luminous efficiency, severe roll&#8208;off characteristics, and short lifetime compared to OLEDs fabricated using thermal evaporation. These demerits impede production of practical SOLED displays. This review outlines the industrial demands for commercial SOLEDs and the current status of SOLED development in industries and academia, and presents research guidelines for the development of SOLEDs that have high efficiency, long lifetime, and good processability to achieve commercialization.

         <title>Controlled Interfacial Polymer Self&#8208;Assembly Coordinates Ultrahigh Drug Loading and Zero&#8208;Order Release in Particles Prepared under Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controlled interfacial polymer self&#8208;assembly enables the engineering of a microparticle that simultaneously features efficient protein and peptide encapsulation (up to 99.9%), ultrahigh mass fraction of therapeutics (up to 49.9%), and zero&#8208;order release of payloads. The developed strategy sets a new paradigm to improve the pharmacokinetic and pharmacological performances of water&#8208;soluble therapeutics.








Abstract
Microparticles are successfully engineered through controlled interfacial self&#8208;assembly of polymers to harmonize ultrahigh drug loading with zero&#8208;order release of protein payloads. To address their poor miscibility with carrier materials, protein molecules are transformed into nanoparticles, whose surfaces are covered with polymer molecules. This polymer layer hinders the transfer of cargo nanoparticles from oil to water, achieving superior encapsulation efficiency (up to 99.9%). To control payload release, the polymer density at the oil&#8211;water interface is enhanced, forming a compact shell for microparticles. The resultant microparticles can harvest up to 49.9% mass fraction of proteins with zero&#8208;order release kinetics in vivo, enabling an efficient glycemic control in type 1 diabetes. Moreover, the precise control of engineering process offered through continuous flow results in high batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch reproducibility and, ultimately, excellent scale&#8208;up feasibility.

         <title>An Integrally Formed Janus Hydrogel for Robust Wet&#8208;Tissue Adhesive and Anti&#8208;Postoperative Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrally formed asymmetrically adhesive hydrogel is fabricated by controlling the interfacial distribution of free &#8211;COOH groups via simply adjusting the stirring speed. The difference in adhesive strength achieves as high as 20 times between the two sides of one hydrogel, which attains one&#8208;sided robust adhesion to the wet tissue, simultaneously preventing the postoperative adhesion for the opposite side.








Abstract
Facile fabrication of asymmetrically adhesive hydrogel with robust wet tissue adhesion simultaneously with effective anti&#8208;postoperative adhesion still remains a great challenge. In this work, an integrally formed Janus hydrogel is facilely fabricated in one step by controlling the interfacial distribution of free carboxyl groups on the two sides of hydrogels. At a lower stirring speed, the generated bigger sized emulsion droplets mainly occupy the top surface of hydrogel, which effectively hinders the exposition of carboxyl groups on the top surface, driving them to be more distributed on the bottom surface, ultimately resulting in the poor adhesion of top surface but robust adhesion of bottom surface to various wet tissue even underwater. The difference in adhesive strength achieves as high as 20 times between the two surfaces. In vivo rabbit experiment outcomes clearly validate that the bottom surface of hydrogel firmly adheres to the stomach defect, and the other opposite surface can efficiently address the postoperative adhesion problem. Besides, this hydrogel exhibits superior mechanical toughness and conductivity which has been used as a highly adhesive strain sensor to real&#8208;time monitor the beating heart in vivo. This simple yet effective strategy provides a much more feasible approach for creating Janus hydrogels bioadhesives.

         <title>Diagnosing and Correcting the Failure of the Solid&#8208;State Polymer Electrolyte for Enhancing Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clogging of &#8220;dead&#8221; polysulfides on the electrode interface in a diffusion&#8208;restricted solid&#8208;state polymer electrolyte (SPE) is identified as a critical failure cause of solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;S batteries, which can be addressed by applying single&#8208;atom electrocatalysis to tailor the chemical environment in the SPE.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) attract great interest in developing high&#8208;performance yet reliable solid&#8208;state batteries. However, understanding of the failure mechanism of the SPE and SPE&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries remains in its infancy, posing a great barrier to practical solid&#8208;state batteries. Herein, the high accumulation and clogging of &#8220;dead&#8221; lithium polysulfides (LiPS) on the interface between the cathode and SPE with intrinsic diffusion limitation is identified as a critical failure cause of SPE&#8208;based solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;S batteries. It induces a poorly reversible chemical environment with retarded kinetics on the cathode&#8211;SPE interface and in bulk SPEs, starving the Li&#8211;S redox in solid&#8208;state cells. This observation is different from the case in liquid electrolytes with free solvent and charge carriers, where LiPS dissolve but remain alive for electrochemical/chemical redox without interfacial clogging. Electrocatalysis demonstrates the feasibility of tailoring the chemical environment in diffusion&#8208;restricted reaction media for reducing Li&#8211;S redox failure in the SPE. It enables Ah&#8208;level solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;S pouch cells with a high specific energy of 343&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 on the cell level. This work may shed new light on the understanding of the failure mechanism of SPE for bottom&#8208;up improvement of solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Wide&#8208;Humidity Range Applicable, Anti&#8208;Freezing, and Healable Zwitterionic Hydrogels for Ion&#8208;Leakage&#8208;Free Iontronic Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solketal, outperforming the commonly used solvent glycerol, endows healable zwitterionic hydrogels with wide&#8208;humidity range applicability and freeze resistance. The optimized zwitterionic hydrogel satisfactorily serves as a dielectric layer to construct iontronic sensors with no ionic leakage, high sensitivity, and environmental stability. A whole&#8208;body healable, stretchable, and highly&#8208;sensitive sensor based on the zwitterionic hydrogels and composites is demonstrated.








Abstract
Hydrogels have entered the spotlight for applications in soft electronics. It is essential and challenging to obtain hydrogels that can function properly under varying environmental circumstances, that is, 30&#8211;90% relative humidity (RH) and &#8722;20 to 40&#160;&#176;C due to their intrinsic nature to lose and absorb water upon variations in humidity and temperature. In this work, a green solvent, solketal, is introduced into poly 3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;methylprop&#8208;2&#8208;enoyloxy)ethyl azaniumyl propane&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonate (poly(DMAPS)) zwitterionic hydrogels. Compared to glycerol, solketal endows hydrogels with greater possibility for further modification as well as improved water content and mechanical performance consistency over 30&#8211;90% RH. Encouragingly, the optimized hydrogel demonstrates its unique merits as a dielectric layer in iontronic sensors, featuring non&#8208;leaky ions, high sensitivity (1100 kPa&#8722;1), wide humidity, and temperature range applicability. A wide&#8208;humidity range healable and stretchable electrode is attained by combining the hydrogel substrate with Ag paste. A&#160;full&#8208;device healable and highly&#8208;sensitive sensor is developed. This study is a pioneering work that tackles the broad humidity range applicability issue of hydrogels, and demonstrates the ion&#8208;leakage&#8208;free ionic skins with zwitterionic dielectrics. The outcomes of the study will considerably promote advancements in the fields of hydrogel electronics and iontronic sensors.

         <title>Influence of Water Content on Speciation and Phase Formation in Zr&#8211;Porphyrin&#8208;Based MOFs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work evaluates the complexities of synthesizing porphyrinic Zr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), specifically disordered PCN&#8208;224 (dPCN&#8208;224). It is shown that hydrolysis of ZrCl4&#160;or the addition of water is crucial for the formation of the inorganic building unit, and hence, the MOF. In addition, MOF's formation pathway is characterized, revealing that dPCN&#8208;224&#160;forms via at least one intermediate.








Abstract
Controlled synthesis of phase&#8208;pure metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is essential for their application in technological areas such as catalysis or gas sorption. Yet, knowledge of their phase formation and growth remain rather limited, particularly with respect to species such as water whose vital role in MOF synthesis is often neglected. As a consequence, synthetic protocols often lack reproducibility when multiple MOFs can form from the same metal source and linker, and phase mixtures are obtained with little or no control over their composition. In this work, the role of water in the formation of the Zr&#8211;porphyrin MOF disordered PCN&#8208;224 (dPCN&#8208;224) is investigated. Through X&#8208;ray total scattering and scanning electron microscopy, it is observed that dPCN&#8208;224&#160;forms via a metal&#8211;organic intermediate that consists of Zr6O4(OH)4&#160;clusters linked by tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxy&#8208;phenyl)porphyrin molecules. Importantly, water is not only essential to the formation of Zr6O4(OH)4&#160;clusters, but it also plays a primary role in dictating the formation kinetics of dPCN&#8208;224. This multidisciplinary approach to studying the speciation of dPCN&#8208;224&#160;provides a blueprint for how Zr&#8208;MOF synthesis protocols can be assessed and their reproducibility increased, and highlights the importance of understanding the role of water as a decisive component in Zr&#8208;MOF formation.

In addition, MOF's formation pathway is characterized, revealing that dPCN-224&#160;forms via at least one intermediate.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controlled synthesis of phase-pure metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is essential for their application in technological areas such as catalysis or gas sorption. Yet, knowledge of their phase formation and growth remain rather limited, particularly with respect to species such as water whose vital role in MOF synthesis is often neglected. As a consequence, synthetic protocols often lack reproducibility when multiple MOFs can form from the same metal source and linker, and phase mixtures are obtained with little or no control over their composition. In this work, the role of water in the formation of the Zr&#8211;porphyrin MOF disordered PCN-224 (dPCN-224) is investigated. Through X-ray total scattering and scanning electron microscopy, it is observed that dPCN-224&#160;forms via a metal&#8211;organic intermediate that consists of Zr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;clusters linked by tetrakis(4-carboxy-phenyl)porphyrin molecules. Importantly, water is not only essential to the formation of Zr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;clusters, but it also plays a primary role in dictating the formation kinetics of dPCN-224. This multidisciplinary approach to studying the speciation of dPCN-224&#160;provides a blueprint for how Zr-MOF synthesis protocols can be assessed and their reproducibility increased, and highlights the importance of understanding the role of water as a decisive component in Zr-MOF formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ablation of Gap Junction Protein Improves the Efficiency of Nanozyme&#8208;Mediated Catalytic/Starvation/Mild&#8208;Temperature Photothermal Therapy</title>

FePGOGA&#160;nanozymes are constructed by Fe(III)&#8208;mediated oxidative polymerization, and co&#8208;loaded with GOx and Cx43 blockade peptides GAP19. The FePGOGAs exhibit excellent cascade peroxidase&#8208; and oxidase&#8208;like activities that efficiently generate ROS and prevent ROS efflux through Cx43 degradation. The good synergistic effects of the catalytic/starvation/mildPTT therapies are confirmed in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated tumor catalytic therapy is typically hindered by gap junction proteins that form cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell channels to remove cytotoxic ROS, thereby protecting tumor cells from oxidative damage. In this work, a multifunctional nanozyme, FePGOGA, is designed and prepared by Fe(III)&#8208;mediated oxidative polymerization (FeP), followed by glucose oxidase (GOx) and GAP19 peptides co&#8208;loading through electrostatic and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. The FePGOGA nanozyme exhibits excellent cascade peroxidase&#8208; and glutathione&#8208;oxidase&#8208;like activities that efficiently catalyze hydrogen peroxide conversion to hydroxyl radicals and convert reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione disulfide. The loaded GOx starves the tumors and aggravates tumor oxidative stress through glucose decomposition, while GAP19 peptides block the hemichannels by inducing degradation of Cx43, thus increasing the accumulation of intracellular ROS, and decreasing the transport of intracellular glucose. Furthermore, the ROS reacts with primary amines of heat shock proteins to destroy their structure and function, enabling tumor photothermal therapy at the widely sought&#8208;after mild temperature (mildPTT, &#8804;45&#160;&#176;C). In vivo experiments demonstrate the significant antitumor effectof FePGOGA on cal27 xenograft tumors under near&#8208;infrared light irradiation. This study demonstrates the successful ablation of gap junction proteins to overcome resistance to ROS&#8208;mediated therapy, providing a regulator to suppress tumor self&#8208;preservation during tumor starvation, catalytic therapy, and mildPTT.

By combining crystal graph attention networks with a newly created dataset, a compound space spanning 1 billion materials is scanned for new stable materials. As a result, the number of known theoretically synthesizable materials is increased by 30%. The resulting materials are then studied for extreme values of several properties.








Abstract
Crystal&#8208;graph attention neural networks have emerged recently as remarkable tools for the prediction of thermodynamic stability. The efficacy of their learning capabilities and their reliability is however subject to the quantity and quality of the data they are fed. Previous networks exhibit strong biases due to the inhomogeneity of the training data. Here a high&#8208;quality dataset is engineered to provide a better balance across chemical and crystal&#8208;symmetry space. Crystal&#8208;graph neural networks trained with this dataset show unprecedented generalization accuracy. Such networks are applied to perform machine&#8208;learning&#8208;assisted high&#8208;throughput searches of stable materials, spanning 1 billion candidates. In this way, the number of vertices of the global T&#160;= 0&#160;K phase diagram is increased by 30% and find more than &#8776;150&#160;000 compounds with a distance to the convex hull of stability of less than 50&#160;meV&#160;atom&#8722;1. The discovered materials are then accessed for applications, identifying compounds with extreme values of a few properties, such as superconductivity, superhardness, and giant gap&#8208;deformation potentials.

         <title>Maximum Emission Peak Over 1500&#160;nm of Organic Assembly for Blood&#8211;Brain Barrier&#8208;Crossing NIR&#8208;IIb Phototheranostics of Orthotopic Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic assembly with the maximum absorption peak at 1400&#160;nm and emission peak at 1512&#160;nm with trailing over 1700&#160;nm is prepared through the self&#8208;assembly of organic small molecule IR&#8208;1064 for blood&#8211;brain barrier&#8208;crossing NIR&#8208;IIb phototheranostics of orthotopic glioblastoma.








Abstract
The development of blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB)&#8208;crossing phototheranostic agents in second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II), especially in the range of 1500&#8211;1700&#160;nm (NIR&#8208;IIb), affords great opportunities for glioblastoma (GBM) management. Herein, an organic assembly (denoted as LET&#8208;12) with the maximum absorption peak at 1400&#160;nm and emission peak at 1512&#160;nm with trailing over 1700&#160;nm through the self&#8208;assembly of organic small molecule IR&#8208;1064 is designed and subsequently decorated with choline and acetylcholine analogs. The LET&#8208;12 can effectively cross BBB through the brain's choline&#8208;like receptors&#8208;mediated transcytosis and accumulated in tumor tissues, thus achieving fluorescence/photoacoustic (FL/PA) duplex imaging of orthotopic GBM with &#8776;3.0&#160;mm depth and a superior tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal tissue signal ratio (20.93 &#177; 0.59 for FL imaging and 32.63 &#177; 1.16 for PA imaging, respectively). Owing to its good photothermal conversion ability, the LET&#8208;12 also can serve as a photothermal conversion agent, achieving obvious tumor repression of orthotopic murine GBM model after once treatment. The findings indicate that the LET&#8208;12 holds great potential for BBB&#8208;crossing NIR&#8208;IIb phototheranostics of orthotopic GBM. This self&#8208;assembly strategy of organic small molecules opens a new avenue for the construction of NIR&#8208;IIb phototheranostics.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Thin Lithium Silicide Interlayer for Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;thin nanoporous lithium silicide&#8208;based interlayer, acting as a mixed ionic and electronic conductor, is proposed for high energy and safe all&#8208;solid&#8208;state&#8208;batteries using lithium anode. The interlayer not only regulates LiBCC deposition and stripping but also serves as a 3D scaffold for Li ad&#8208;atom formation, LiBCC nucleation, and long&#8208;range transport of ions and electrons at solid&#8208;state electrolyte/LiBCC interface.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries with metallic lithium (LiBCC) anode and solid electrolyte (SE) are under active development. However, an unstable SE/LiBCC interface due to electrochemical and mechanical instabilities hinders their operation. Herein, an ultra&#8208;thin nanoporous mixed ionic and electronic conductor (MIEC) interlayer (&#8776;3.25 &#181;m), which regulates LiBCC deposition and stripping, serving as a 3D scaffold for Li0 ad&#8208;atom formation, LiBCC nucleation, and long&#8208;range transport of ions and electrons at SE/LiBCC interface is demonstrated. Consisting of lithium silicide and carbon nanotubes, the MIEC interlayer is thermodynamically stable against LiBCC and highly lithiophilic. Moreover, its nanopores (&lt;100 nm) confine the deposited LiBCC to the size regime where LiBCC exhibits &#8220;smaller is much softer&#8221; size&#8208;dependent plasticity governed by diffusive deformation mechanisms. The LiBCC thus remains soft enough not to mechanically penetrate SE in contact. Upon further plating, LiBCC grows in between the current collector and the MIEC interlayer, not directly contacting the SE. As a result, a full&#8208;cell having Li3.75Si&#8208;CNT/LiBCC foil as an anode and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 as a cathode displays a high specific capacity of 207.8 mAh g&#8722;1, 92.0% initial Coulombic efficiency, 88.9% capacity retention after 200 cycles (Coulombic efficiency reaches 99.9% after tens of cycles), and excellent rate capability (76% at 5 C).

         <title>Ion&#8208;Transfer Engineering via Janus Hydrogels Enables Ultrahigh Performance and Salt&#8208;Resistant Solar Desalination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Janus ion&#8208;selective hydrogel evaporator enabling cation&#8211;anion reverse diffusion away from the evaporation surfaces is reported. It stably removes salt throughout seven days via diffusion and electromigration, different from the current water&#8208;governed salt&#8208;resistant strategies, significantly lowering the heat loss and reaching a record&#8208;high evaporation rate of 6.86&#160;kg m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 in 15&#160;wt% brine.








Abstract
Emerging solar interfacial evaporation offers the most promising response to the severe freshwater crisis. However, the most challenging bottleneck is the conflict between resisting salt accumulation and maintaining high evaporation performance since conventional salt&#8208;resistant evaporators enhance water flow to remove salt, leading to tremendous heat loss. Herein, an ion&#8208;transfer engineering is proposed via a Janus ion&#8208;selective hydrogel that enables ion&#8208;electromigration salt removal, breaking the historical dependence on water convection, and significantly lowering the heat loss. The hydrogels drive cations downward and anions upward, away from the evaporation surfaces. An electrical potential is thus established inside the evaporator and salt in 15&#160;wt% brine is removed stably for seven days. A record&#8208;high evaporation rate of 6.86 kg m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 in 15&#160;wt% brine, 2.5&#160;times the previously reported works, is achieved. With the from&#8208;scratch salt&#8208;resistant route, comprehensive water&#8208;thermal analysis, and record&#8208;high performance, this work holds great potential for the future salt&#8208;resistant evaporators.

         <title>Flame Aerosol Synthesis of Metal Sulfides at High Temperature in Oxygen Lean Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The development of a novel reactive spray technology based on the well&#8208;known gas phase metal oxide synthesis route provides innumerable opportunities for the production of non&#8208;oxide nanoparticles. Among these materials, metal sulfides are expected to have a high impact especially in the development of electrochemical and photochemical high surface area materials. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, MnS, CoS, Cu2S, ZnS, Ag2S, In2S3, SnS, and Bi2S3 were synthesized in an O2&#8208;lean and sulfur&#8208;rich environment. In addition, the formation of Cu2S in a single droplet combustion experiment, is reported. The multi&#8208;scale approach combining flame sprays with single droplet combustion is expected to pave the way towards a fundamental understanding of the gas phase formation of metal sulfides in the future. The knowledge acquired will open the possibility for the development of a next generation gas&#8208;phase technology facilitating the scalable synthesis of functional binary/ternary metal sulfides.

         <title>Enzymatic Regulation of Protein&#8208;Protein Interactions in Artificial Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Membraneless organelles are important for spatial organization of proteins and regulation of intracellular processes. Proteins can be recruited to these condensates by specific protein&#8208;protein or protein&#8208;nucleic acid interactions, which are often regulated by post&#8208;translational modifications. However, the mechanisms behind these dynamic, affinity&#8208;based protein recruitment events are not well understood. Here, we present a coacervate system that incorporates the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 scaffold protein to study enzymatically regulated recruitment of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#8208;binding proteins, which mostly bind in a phosphorylation&#8208;dependent manner. Synthetic coacervates are efficiently loaded with 14&#8208;3&#8208;3, and phosphorylated binding partners, such as the c&#8208;Raf pS233/pS259 peptide (c&#8208;Raf), show 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#8208;dependent sequestration with up to 161&#8208;fold increase in local concentration. The c&#8208;Raf domain is fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP&#8208;c&#8208;Raf) to demonstrate recruitment of proteins. In situ phosphorylation of GFP&#8208;c&#8208;Raf by a kinase leads to enzymatically regulated uptake. The introduction of a phosphatase into coacervates preloaded with the phosphorylated 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#8208;GFP&#8208;c&#8208;Raf complex results in a significant cargo efflux mediated by dephosphorylation. Finally, the general applicability of this platform to study protein&#8208;protein interactions is demonstrated by the phosphorylation&#8208;dependent and 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#8208;mediated active reconstitution of a split&#8208;luciferase inside artificial cells. This work presents an approach to study dynamically regulated protein recruitment in condensates, using native interaction domains.

         <title>(111)&#8208;Dominated Perovskite Films by Antisolvent Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fabricating perovskite films with a dominant crystal orientation is an effective path to realize quasi&#8208;single crystal perovskite film, which can eliminate the fluctuation of the electrical properties in films arising from grain&#8208;to&#8208;grain variations, and improve the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Perovskite (FAPbI3) films based on one&#8208;step antisolvent methods usually suffer from chaotic orientations due to the inevitable intermediate phase conversion from intermediates of PbI2&#8226;DMSO, FA2Pb3I8&#8226;4DMSO and &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 to &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. Here we report a high&#8208;quality perovskite film with (111) preferred orientation ((111)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) using a short&#8208;chain isomeric alcohol antisolvent, isopropanol (IPA) or isobutanol (IBA). The interaction between IPA and PbI2 leads to a corner sharing structure instead of an edge&#8208;sharing PbI2 octahedron, sidestepping the formation of these intermediates. With the volatilization of IPA, FA+ can replace IPA in situ to form &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 along the (111) direction. Compared to randomly&#8208;orientated perovskites, the dominantly (111) orientated perovskite ((111)&#8208;perovskite) exhibits improved carrier mobility, uniform surface potential, suppressed film defects and enhanced photostability. PSCs based on the (111)&#8208;perovskite films show 22% power conversion efficiency and excellent stability, which remains unchanged after 600&#160;h continuous working at maximum power point, and 95% after 2000&#160;h of storage in atmosphere environment.

         <title>Bionic Tactile&#8208;Gustatory Receptor for Object Identification Based on All&#8208;Polymer Electrochemical Transistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The human sensory receptors enable us to perceive the real world effortlessly. Hence, massive efforts have been devoted to the development of bionic receptors capable of identifying objects. Unfortunately, most of the existing devices are limited to single sensory emulation and are established on solid&#8208;state electronic technologies, which are incompatible with the biological reactions occurring in electrolyte media. Here, we present an iontronic tactile&#8208;gustatory receptor using all&#8208;polymer electrochemical transistor (AECT) for the first time. The sensor is biocompatible with the operation voltage of 0.1&#160;V, which is 1 to 2 orders lower than those of reported values. By this study, one receptor is able to accurately recognize various objects perceived by the human tactile and gustatory system without complex circuitry. Additionally, to promote its further application, flexible AECT arrays with channel length of 2&#160;&#956;m and density of 104,167 transistors cm&#8722;2 (yield of 97%) are fabricated, 1 to 5 orders higher than those of related works. Finally, a flexible integrated network for electrocardiogram recording is successfully constructed. This study moves a step forward towards state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art bionic sensors.

Additionally, to promote its further application, flexible AECT arrays with channel length of 2&#160;&#956;m and density of 104,167 transistors cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (yield of 97%) are fabricated, 1 to 5 orders higher than those of related works. Finally, a flexible integrated network for electrocardiogram recording is successfully constructed. This study moves a step forward towards state-of-the-art bionic sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Activatable Graphene Quantum Dots&#8208;Based Nano&#8208;Transformers for Long&#8208;Period Tumor Imaging and Repeated Photodynamic Therapy</title>

Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is considered as an emerging therapeutic modality against cancer with high spatiotemporal selectivity because the utilized photosensitizers (PSs) are only active and toxic upon light irradiation. To maximize the effectiveness, PDT is usually applied repetitively for ablating various tumors. However, the total overdose of PSs from repeated administrations causes severe side effects, especially skin phototoxicity. Herein, we develop tumor acidity&#8208;activated graphene quantum dots&#8208;based nano&#8208;transformers (GQD NT) as PS vehicles for long&#8208;period tumor imaging and repeated PDT. Under the guidance of Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;Asp (RGD) peptide, GQD NT can target to tumor tissues actively, and then loosened and enlarged slowly in tumor acidity, thus promising the long tumor retention and improving the bioavailability of the loaded PSs. Afterwards, GQD NT can be disassembled and discharged, which is benefit to cellular uptake of PSs. Upon laser irradiation, GQD NT generates mild hyperthermia that enhances cell membrane permeability and further promotes the cellular uptake of PSs. Most intriguingly, the as&#8208;prepared GQD NT not only &#8220;turns&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescence/magnetic resonance imaging signals, but also achieves efficient repeated PDT through one injection. Notably, the dose of PSs is reduced to 3.5&#160;&#956;mol/kg, which is 10&#8764;30 times lower than that of the reported works. Overall, this study exploits a smart vehicle to enhance accumulation, retention and release of PSs in tumors through programmed deformation, thus improving the bioavailability of PSs and overcoming the overdose obstacle in repeated PDT.

         <title>Liquid Super&#8208;Spreading Boosted High&#8208;Performance Jet&#8208;Flow Boiling for Enhancement of Phase&#8208;Change Cooling</title>

Abstract
Enhanced boiling heat transfer via surface engineering is a topic of general interest for its great demand in industrial fields. However, as a dynamic interfacial phenomenon, deep understanding of its process and mechanism, including liquid re&#8208;wetting and vapor departure, is still challenging. Herein, we design a micro&#8208;/nanostuctured Cu surface containing periodic micro&#8208;groove/pyramid array with rich nano&#8208;wrinkles, where super&#8208;spreading (&lt;134.1&#160;ms) of organic cooling agents highly boosts liquid re&#8208;wetting process, causing a discontinuous solid&#8208;liquid&#8208;vapor three&#8208;phase contact line and ultra&#8208;low under&#8208;liquid bubble adhesion force (&#8764;1.3 &#956;N). Therefore, a characteristic, ultra&#8208;fast jet&#8208;flow boiling (bubbles rapidly ejected in multiple strips) is obtained on this surface, giving a priority to nucleation (superheat &#8764;1.5&#160;&#176;C) and simultaneously enhancing the critical heat flux and heat&#8208;transfer coefficient by up to 80% and 608%, respectively, compared with a flat surface. In situ observation and analysis of the nucleation, growth, and departure of micro&#8208;sized jet&#8208;flow bubbles reflects that micro&#8208;grooves/pyramids with nano&#8208;wrinkles promote the latent heat exchange process by super&#8208;spreading induced ultra&#8208;fast liquid re&#8208;wetting and constant vapor film coalescing. Based on the designed structures, high&#8208;performance phase&#8208;change cooling for CPU heat management in supercomputer centers is accomplished with an ultra&#8208;low power usage effectiveness (PUE&lt;1.04).

         <title>Universal renaissance strategy of metal fluoride in secondary ion batteries enabled by liquid metal gallium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state alkali ion batteries represent a future trend in battery technology, as well as provide an opportunity for low&#8208;cost metal fluoride electrode materials, if certain intrinsic problems can be resolved. In this work, we proposed a liquid metal activation strategy in which liquid Ga elements were generated in situ and doped into the LiF crystal structure by introducing a small amount of GaF3. Benefiting from these two Ga states of existence, in which the liquid metal Ga could continuously maintain conformable ion/electron transport networks, while the doped Ga in the LiF crystal structure catalyzed Li&#8208;F splitting, the lithium&#8208;ion storage capacity of MnF2 significantly increased by 87%. A similar effect could be obtained in FeF3, where the sodium&#8208;ion storage capacity was enhanced by 33%. This universal strategy with few restrictions could be used to realize a complete renaissance of metal fluorides, as well as offer an opportunity for the new application of liquid metals in the field of energy storage.

         <title>Over 18% efficiency of all&#8208;polymer solar cells with long&#8208;term stability enabled by Y6 as a solid additive</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Morphology control greatly influences the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and long&#8208;term stability of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs); however, it remains challenging owing to their complex crystallization behavior. Herein, we introduced a small amount of Y6 (2 wt%) as a solid additive into a PM6:PY&#8208;DT blend. Y6 remained inside the active layer and interacted with PY&#8208;DT to form a well&#8208;mixed phase. Increased molecular packing, enlarged phase separation size, and decreased trap density were observed for the Y6&#8208;processed PM6:PY&#8208;DT blend. The corresponding devices showed simultaneously improved short&#8208;circuit current and fill factor, achieving a high PCE of over 18% and excellent long&#8208;term stability, with a T80 lifetime of 1180&#160;h and an extrapolated T70 lifetime of 9185&#160;h at maximum power point tracking (MPP) conditions under continuous one&#8208;sun illumination. This Y6&#8208;assisted strategy was successfully applied to other all&#8208;polymer blends, demonstrating its universality for all&#8208;PSCs. This work paves a new way for the fabrication of all&#8208;PSCs with high efficiency and superior long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>Multi&#8208;scale Structure Engineering of ZnSnO3 for Ultra&#8208;long&#8208;life Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

Abstract
Suppressing the severe water&#8208;induced side reactions and uncontrolled dendrite growth of zinc (Zn) metal anodes is crucial for aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries to achieve ultra&#8208;long cyclic lifespans and promote their practical applications. Herein, we propose a concept of multi&#8208;scale (electronic&#8208;crystal&#8208;geometric) structure design to precisely construct the hollow amorphous ZnSnO3 cubes (HZTO) for optimizing Zn metal anodes. In situ gas chromatography demonstrates that Zn anodes modified by HZTO (HZTO@Zn) can effectively inhibit the undesired hydrogen evolution. The pH stabilization and corrosion suppression mechanisms are revealed via operando pH detection and in situ Raman analysis. Moreover, comprehensively experimental and theoretical results prove that the amorphous structure and hollow architecture endow the protective HZTO layer with strong Zn affinity and rapid Zn2+ diffusion, which are beneficial for achieving the ideal dendrite&#8208;free Zn anode. Accordingly, the excellent electrochemical performances for HZTO@Zn symmetric battery (6900&#160;h at 2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 100 times longer than that of bare Zn), HZTO@Zn||V2O5 full battery (99.3% capacity retention after 1100 cycles), and HZTO@Zn||V2O5 pouch cell (120.6&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1) are achieved. This work with multi&#8208;scale structure advantage provides significant guidance to rationally develop advanced protective layers for other ultra&#8208;long&#8208;life metal batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Suppressing the severe water-induced side reactions and uncontrolled dendrite growth of zinc (Zn) metal anodes is crucial for aqueous Zn-metal batteries to achieve ultra-long cyclic lifespans and promote their practical applications. Herein, we propose a concept of multi-scale (electronic-crystal-geometric) structure design to precisely construct the hollow amorphous ZnSnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cubes (HZTO) for optimizing Zn metal anodes. In situ gas chromatography demonstrates that Zn anodes modified by HZTO (HZTO@Zn) can effectively inhibit the undesired hydrogen evolution.

         <title>Rationalized Electroepitaxy toward Scalable Single&#8208;Crystal Zn Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electroepitaxy has been recognized as an effective approach to prepare metal electrodes with nearly complete reversibility. Nevertheless, large&#8208;scale manipulation is still not attainable owing to complicated interfacial chemistry. Here, w e demonstrate the feasibility of extending Zn electroepitaxy toward the bulk phase over a mass&#8208;produced mono&#8208;oriented Cu(111) foil. Interfacial Cu&#8208;Zn alloy and turbulent electroosmosis w ere circumvented by adopting a potentiostatic electrodeposition protocol. The as&#8208;prepared Zn single&#8208;crystalline anode enabled stable cycling of symmetric cells at a stringent current density of 50.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The assembled full cell further sustained a capacity retention of 95.7% at 5.0 A g&#8722;1 for 1500 cycles, accompanied by a controllably low N/P ratio of 7.5. In addition to Zn, Ni electroepitaxy can be realized by using the same approach. This study might inspire rational exploration of the design of high&#8208;end metal electrodes.

         <title>Constructing Interfacial Gradient Heterostructure Enables Efficient CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells and Printed Minimodules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Severe nonradiative recombination originating from interfacial defects together with the pervasive energy level mismatch at the interface remarkably limits the performance of CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs). These issues need to be addressed urgently for high&#8208;performance cells and their applications. Herein, we demonstrate an interfacial gradient heterostructure based on low&#8208;temperature post&#8208;treatment of quaternary bromide salts for efficient CsPbI3 PSCs with an impressive efficiency of 21.31% and an extraordinary fill factor of 0.854. Further investigation reveals that Br&#8722; ions diffuse into the perovskite films to heal undercoordinated Pb2+ and inhibit Pb clusters formation, thus suppressing nonradiative recombination in CsPbI3. Meanwhile, a more compatible interfacial energy level alignment resulting from Br&#8722; gradient distribution and organic cations surface termination has been also achieved, hence promoting charge separation and collection. Consequently, we also demonstrate the printed small&#8208;size cell with an efficiency of 20.28% and 12&#8208;cm2 printed CsPbI3 minimodules with a record efficiency of 16.60%. Moreover, the unencapsulated CsPbI3 films and devices exhibit superior stability.

         <title>Mechanochemical synthesis of high&#8208;entropy perovskite toward highly sensitive and stable X&#8208;ray flat panel detector</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Perovskites are attracting attentions for optoelectronic devices. Despite its promise, the large&#8208;scale synthesis of perovskite materials with exact stoichiometry, especially high&#8208;entropy perovskites, has been a major challenge. Moreover, the difficulty in stoichiometry control also hinders the development of perovskite X&#8208;ray flat panel detectors. Previous reports all employed simple MAPbI3 as the active layer, while the performance still falls short of optimized single crystal&#8208;based single pixel detectors. Herein we adopt the scalable and universal strategy of a mechanochemical method to synthesize stoichiometric high&#8208;entropy perovskite powders with high quality and high quantity (&gt;1&#160;kg per batch). By utilizing these stoichiometric perovskites, we report the first FA0.9MA0.05Cs0.05Pb(I0.9Br0.1)3&#8208;based X&#8208;ray flat panel detectors with low trap density and large mobility&#8208;lifetime product (7.5&#215;10&#8722;3 cm2 V&#8722;1). The assembled panel detector exhibits close&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal performance (high sensitivity of 2.1&#215;104 &#956;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, ultralow detection limit of 1.25 nGyair s&#8722;1), high spatial resolution of 0.46 lp/pixel, as well as excellent thermal robustness under industrial standards. The high performance in in the high&#8208;entropy perovskite&#8208;based X&#8208;ray FPDs has the potential to facilitate the development of new&#8208;generation X&#8208;ray detection systems.

         <title>Exploring Electronic Characteristics of Acceptor&#8208;Donor&#8208;Acceptor type Molecules by Single&#8208;Molecule Charge Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The electronic characteristics of organic optoelectronic materials determine the performance of corresponding devices. Clarifying the relationship between molecular structure and electronic characteristics at the single&#8208;molecule level can help to achieve high performance for organic optoelectronic materials and devices, especially for organic photovoltaics. In this work, a typical acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8211;D&#8211;A) type molecule is explored by combining theoretical and experimental studies to reveal the intrinsic electronic characteristics at the single&#8208;molecule level. Specifically, the A&#8211;D&#8211;A type molecule with 1,1&#8208;dicyano methylene&#8208;3&#8208;indanone (INCN) acceptor units exhibits an enhanced conductance in single&#8208;molecule junctions when compared with the control donor molecule, because the acceptor units of the A&#8211;D&#8211;A type molecule contribute additional transport channels. In addition, through opening the S&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O noncovalent conformational lock by protonation to expose the &#8722;S anchoring sites, the charge transport of the D central part is detected, proving that the conductive orbitals contributed by the INCN acceptor groups could penetrate the whole A&#8211;D&#8211;A molecule. These results provide important insights into the development of high&#8208;performance organic optoelectronic materials and devices toward practical applications.

         <title>Overstretch strategy to double the designed elastic stretchability of stretchable electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Achieving or enhancing the elastic stretchability of inorganic stretchable electronics is critically significant. However, only two types of fundamental strategies&#8212;using the prestrained elastic substrate and designing the geometric layouts&#8212;have been exploited thus far. This study proposes a third strategy, an overstretch strategy, applied beyond the designed elastic range of stretchable structures after transfer printing and bonding to a soft substrate. The theoretical, numerical, and experimental results collectively prove that the overstretch strategy can double the designed elastic stretchability of fabricated stretchable electronics and is valid for various geometrical interconnects with both thick and thin cross&#8208;sections. The underlying mechanism is that the elastic range of the critical part of the stretchable structure is doubled, owing to the evolution of the elastoplastic constitutive relation during overstretching. The overstretch strategy can be easily executed and combined with the other two strategies to enhance elastic stretchability, which has profound implications for the design, fabrication, and applications of inorganic stretchable electronics.

         <title>Halides&#8208;enhanced buried interfaces for stable and extremely low&#8208;voltage&#8208;deficit perovskite solar cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Perovskite buried interface has demonstrated pivotal roles in determining both efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), however, challenges remain in understanding and managing the interfaces due to their non&#8208;exposed feature. Here, we propose a facile and versatile strategy of pre&#8208;grafted halides to strengthen the SnO2&#8208;perovskite buried interface by precisely manipulating perovskite defects and carrier dynamics through alteration of halide electronegativity (&#967;), thereby resulting in both favorable perovskite crystallization and minimized interfacial carrier losses. Specifically, the implementation of fluoride with the highest &#967; induces the strongest binding affinity to uncoordinated SnO2 defects and perovskite cations, leading to retarded perovskite crystallization and high&#8208;quality perovskite films with reduced residual stress. These improved properties enable champion efficiencies of 24.2% (the control: 20.5%) and 22.1% (the control: 18.7%) in rigid and flexible devices with extremely low voltage deficit down to 386&#160;mV, all of which are among the highest reported values for PSCs with a similar device architecture. In addition, the resulting devices exhibit marked improvements in the device longevity under various stressors of humidity (&gt;5000&#160;h), light (1000&#160;h), heat (180&#160;h) and bending test (10000 times).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perovskite buried interface has demonstrated pivotal roles in determining both efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), however, challenges remain in understanding and managing the interfaces due to their non-exposed feature. Here, we propose a facile and versatile strategy of pre-grafted halides to strengthen the SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-perovskite buried interface by precisely manipulating perovskite defects and carrier dynamics through alteration of halide electronegativity (&lt;i&gt;&#967;&lt;/i&gt;), thereby resulting in both favorable perovskite crystallization and minimized interfacial carrier losses. Specifically, the implementation of fluoride with the highest &lt;i&gt;&#967;&lt;/i&gt; induces the strongest binding affinity to uncoordinated SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; defects and perovskite cations, leading to retarded perovskite crystallization and high-quality perovskite films with reduced residual stress. These improved properties enable champion efficiencies of 24.2% (the control: 20.5%) and 22.1% (the control: 18.7%) in rigid and flexible devices with extremely low voltage deficit down to 386&#160;mV, all of which are among the highest reported values for PSCs with a similar device architecture. In addition, the resulting devices exhibit marked improvements in the device longevity under various stressors of humidity (&amp;gt;5000&#160;h), light (1000&#160;h), heat (180&#160;h) and bending test (10000 times). This method thus provides an effective way to improve the quality of buried interfaces towards high-performance PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;

Artificial intelligence in general and machine learning in particular are gaining ever more importance in science and technology. In materials science, they are taking over tedious screening tasks and helping design and discover materials based on both explicit and tacit previous knowledge possessed by the scientist. Social and humanistic aspects are acquiring tremendous importance, as power and explainability seem to grow at the expense of each other.








Abstract
Artificial intelligence (AI) is gaining strength, and materials science can both contribute to and profit from it. In a simultaneous progress race, new materials, systems, and processes can be devised and optimized thanks to machine learning (ML) techniques, and such progress can be turned into innovative computing platforms. Future materials scientists will profit from understanding how ML can boost the conception of advanced materials. This review covers aspects of computation from the fundamentals to directions taken and repercussions produced by computation to account for the origins, procedures, and applications of AI. ML and its methods are reviewed to provide basic knowledge of its implementation and its potential. The materials and systems used to implement AI with electric charges are finding serious competition from other information&#8208;carrying and processing agents. The impact these techniques have on the inception of new advanced materials is so deep that a new paradigm is developing where implicit knowledge is being mined to conceive materials and systems for functions instead of finding applications to found materials. How far this trend can be carried is hard to fathom, as exemplified by the power to discover unheard of materials or physical laws buried in data.

         <title>Ti3C2Tx MXene van der Waals Gate Contact for GaN High Electron Mobility Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ti3C2Tx MXene films are integrated into GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) as gate contacts, wherein van der Waals heterojunctions are formed between MXene films and GaN without direct chemical bonding. The Schottky gate GaN HEMTs with enhanced gate controllability exhibit a record high ION/IOFF current ratio of &#8776;1013 and a near&#8208;ideal subthreshold swing of 61&#160;mV dec&#8722;1.








Abstract
Gate controllability is a key factor that determines the performance of GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs). However, at the traditional metal&#8208;GaN interface, direct chemical interaction between metal and GaN can result in fixed charges and traps, which can significantly deteriorate the gate controllability. In this study, Ti3C2Tx MXene films are integrated into GaN HEMTs as the gate contact, wherein van der Waals heterojunctions are formed between MXene films and GaN without direct chemical bonding. The GaN HEMTs with enhanced gate controllability exhibit an extremely low off&#8208;state current (IOFF) of 10&#8722;7 mA&#160;mm&#8722;1, a record high ION/IOFF current ratio of &#8776;1013 (which is six orders of magnitude higher than conventional Ni/Au contact), a high off&#8208;state drain breakdown voltage of 1085&#160;V, and a near&#8208;ideal subthreshold swing of 61 mV&#160;dec&#8722;1. This work shows the great potential of MXene films as gate electrodes in wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductor devices.

         <title>Biomimetic Gradient Bouligand Structure Enhances Impact Resistance of Ceramic&#8208;Polymer Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Translating different biostructural elements into a single synthetic material represents a promising pathway to achieve improved mechanical properties. Here, one new&#8208;style biomimetic structure is designed by coupling gradient structure with Bouligand structure, resulting in a ceramic&#8208;polymer composite with synergistically enhanced impact resistance. This work highlights the importance of hierarchical structural design for future impact&#8208;resistant structural materials.








Abstract
Biological materials relied on multiple synergistic structural design elements typically exhibit excellent comprehensive mechanical properties. Hierarchical incorporation of different biostructural elements into a single artificial material is a promising approach to enhance mechanical properties, but remains challenging. Herein, a biomimetic structural design strategy is proposed by coupling gradient structure with twisted plywood Bouligand structure, attempting to improve the impact resistance of ceramic&#8208;polymer composites. Via robocasting and sintering, kaolin ceramic filaments reinforced by coaxially aligned alumina nanoplatelets are arranged into Bouligand structure with a gradual transition in filament spacing along the thickness direction. After the following polymer infiltration, biomimetic ceramic&#8208;polymer composites with a gradient Bouligand (GB) structure are eventually fabricated. Experimental investigations reveal that the incorporation of gradient structure into Bouligand structure improves both the peak force and total energy absorption of the obtained ceramic&#8208;polymer composites. Computational modeling further suggests the substantial improvement in impact resistance by adopting GB structure, and clarifies the underlying deformation behavior of the biomimetic GB structured composites under impact. This biomimetic design strategy may provide valuable insights for developing lightweight and impact&#8208;resistant structural materials in the future.

         <title>High Energy Harvesting Performances Silicone Elastomer via Filling Soft Dielectric with Stretching Deformability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft dielectric with good interfacial interaction, dielectric enhancement, and deformability is developed and used as novel filler for dielectric elastomer, significantly improving the stretched breakdown strength of nanocomposite under 800% plane strain. Dielectric elastomer generator based on this soft filler shows high power generation energy density (130.5 mJ g&#8722;1) and record electromechanical conversion efficiency (44.5%).








Abstract
Dielectric elastomer generators (DEGs) with high generated energy density and high conversion efficiency are of great interest. Among several dielectric elastomers (DEs), silicone elastomer filled with ceramic fillers have been extensively studied for their high elasticity, insulation, and permittivity. However, the stretched breakdown strength (Ebs) of such composites decreases significantly under large strain, thus sharply reduces its energy harvesting performances. In this study, a polar rubber&#8208;based dielectric (GNBR) is synthetized and creatively used as &#8220;soft filler&#8221; for silicone elastomer. Benefiting from the deformability under stretching and its inherent strong interface bonding with silicone elastomer, this soft filler effectively avoids the formation of weak interface under large strain and reduces the local field strength of interface area. As expected, the composite filled with soft filler (GNBR/PMVS) shows enhanced Ebs of 2.8 times that of composite with traditional hard filler (TiO2/PMVS) under equibiaxial strain of 200%. As a result, GNBR/PMVS composite exhibits maximum energy density of 130.5 mJ g&#8722;1 with up&#8208;to&#8208;date highest power conversion efficiency of reported DEG (44.5%). The findings will provide new insights in the rational design of DE composites characterized by high stretched breakdown strength for advanced energy harvesting system.

         <title>Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum Inspired Polystyrene&#8208;Brush&#8208;Based Superhigh Sulfur Content Cathodes Enable Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Cells with High Mass and Capacity Loading</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rough endoplasmic reticuluminspired superhigh&#8208;sulfur&#8208;content cathode is successfully fabricated with a unique topological structure at the molecularlevel to realize a Li&#63743;S cell with high mass and capacity loading, which not only demonstrates a sophisticated biomimetic design model but also connects the two disparate fields of biology and electrochemical energy storage.








Abstract
The development of highly sophisticated biomimetic models is significant yet remains challenging in the electrochemical energy storage field. Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#63743;S) cells with high sulfur content and high&#8208;sulfur&#8208;loading cathodes are urgently required to meet the fast&#8208;growing demand for electronic devices. Nevertheless, such cathode materials generally suffer from large sulfur agglomeration, nonporous structure, and insufficient conductivity, leading to rapid capacity decay and low sulfur utilization. Herein, inspired by rough endoplasmic reticulum, a 2D polystyrene (PS)&#8208;brush&#8208;based (G&#8208;g&#8208;PS) superhigh&#8208;sulfur&#8208;content (96 wt%) composite(G&#8208;g&#8208;sPS@S) is fabricated via the vulcanization reaction. The vulcanized PS side&#8208;chains and their S8 composites on the nanosheet surface can efficiently provide sulfur species, and the intersheet interstitial pores can provide rapid mass&#8208;transfer channels for redox reactions of sulfur species. Furthermore, the highly sulfophilic vulcanized PS side&#8208;chains are able to effectively inhibit the shuttle effect of polysulfides and regulate their redox process. With these merits, the cells with G&#8208;g&#8208;sPS@S cathodes exhibit an ultralow decay rate of 0.02% per cycle over 400 cycles at 2 C and deliver a superior areal capacity of 12.6 mAh cm&#8722;2 even with a high sulfur loading of 10.5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of highly sophisticated biomimetic models is significant yet remains challenging in the electrochemical energy storage field. Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;S) cells with high sulfur content and high-sulfur-loading cathodes are urgently required to meet the fast-growing demand for electronic devices. Nevertheless, such cathode materials generally suffer from large sulfur agglomeration, nonporous structure, and insufficient conductivity, leading to rapid capacity decay and low sulfur utilization. Herein, inspired by rough endoplasmic reticulum, a 2D polystyrene (PS)-brush-based (G-&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;-PS) superhigh-sulfur-content (96 wt%) composite(G-&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;PS@S) is fabricated via the vulcanization reaction.

         <title>Monolayer Superconductivity and Tunable Topological Electronic Structure at the Fe(Te,Se)/Bi2Te3 Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulk FeTe0.55Se0.45 is a promising candidate for topological superconductivity but the inhomogeneity from doping raises doubts about the existence of Majorana modes. This work explores thin films of FeTe1&#8208;ySey (Fe(Te,Se)) grown on Bi2Te3 that reveal superconductivity at the monolayer limit. Control over the interfacial electronic structure is demonstrated to maintain the spin&#8208;momentum locking necessary for topological superconductivity with significantly less doping.








Abstract
The interface between 2D topological Dirac states and an s&#8208;wave superconductor is expected to support Majorana&#8208;bound states (MBS) that can be used for quantum computing applications. Realizing these novel states of matter and their applications requires control over superconductivity and spin&#8208;orbit coupling to achieve spin&#8208;momentum&#8208;locked topological interface states (TIS) which are simultaneously superconducting. While signatures of MBS have been observed in the magnetic vortex cores of bulk FeTe0.55Se0.45, inhomogeneity and disorder from doping make these signatures unclear and inconsistent between vortices. Here superconductivity is reported in monolayer (ML) FeTe1&#8211;ySey (Fe(Te,Se)) grown on Bi2Te3 by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Spin and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SARPES) directly resolve the interfacial spin and electronic structure of Fe(Te,Se)/Bi2Te3 heterostructures. For y&#160;= 0.25, the Fe(Te,Se) electronic structure is found to overlap with the Bi2Te3 TIS and the desired spin&#8208;momentum locking is not observed. In contrast, for y&#160;= 0.1, reduced inhomogeneity measured by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and a smaller Fe(Te,Se) Fermi surface with clear spin&#8208;momentum locking in the topological states are found. Hence, it is demonstrated that the Fe(Te,Se)/Bi2Te3 system is a highly tunable platform for realizing MBS where reduced doping can improve characteristics important for Majorana interrogation and potential applications.

         <title>Trans&#8208;Reflective Structural Color Filters Assisting Multifunctional&#8208;Integrated Semitransparent Photovoltaic Window</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of multifunctional STOPVs for smart windows are presented, based on strong resonance effect of asymmetrical MIM microcavities. These devices present a recorded QUE of 80%, flowery trans&#8208;reflective structural colors scanning visible region, superior UV&#8208;blocking (300&#8211;400&#160;nm) of 95%, and IR&#8208;rejection (700&#8211;1400&#160;nm) of 100%, of which, the rear two performances are individually better than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art commercial optical films for solar window.








Abstract
Multifunction&#8208;integrated semitransparent organic photovoltaic cells (STOPVs), with high power generation, colorful transmittance/reflectance, excellent&#160;ultraviolet (UV) protection, and thermal insulation, are fully in line with the concept of architectural aesthetics and photoprotection characteristics for building&#8208;integrated photovoltaic&#8208;window. For the indelible rainbow color photovoltaic window, one crucial issue is to realize the integration of these photons&#8208; and photoelectric&#8208;related multifunction. Herein, dynamic transmissive and reflective structural color controllable filters, with asymmetrical metal&#8208;insulator&#8208;metal (MIM) configurations (20&#160;nm&#8208;Ag&#8208;HATCN&#8208;30&#160;nm&#8208;Ag) through machine learning, are deliberately designed for colorful STOPV devices. This endows the resultant integrated devices with &#8776;5% enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) than the bare&#8208;STOPVs, gifted UV (300&#8211;400&#160;nm) blocking rates as high as 93.5, 94.1, 90.2, and 94.5%, as well as a superior&#160;infrared radiation (IR) (700&#8208;1400&#160;nm) rejection approaching 100% for transparent purple&#8208;, blue&#8208;, green&#8208; and red&#8208;STOPV cells, respectively. Most importantly, benefiting from the photonic recycling effect beyond microcavity resonance wavelength, a reported quantum utilization efficiency (QUE) as high as 80%, is first presented for the transparent&#8208;green&#8208;STOPVs with an ultra&#8208;narrow bandgap of 1.2&#160;eV. These asymmetrical Febry&#8208;P&#233;rot transmissive and reflective structural color filters can also be extended to silicon&#8208; and perovskite&#8208;based optoelectric devices and make it possible to integrate additional target optical functions for multi&#8208;purpose optoelectric devices.

         <title>Dual Behavior Regulation: Tether&#8208;Free Deep&#8208;Brain Stimulation by Photothermal and Upconversion Hybrid Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports two upconversion hybrid nanoparticles modified with photothermal agents for optogenetics. They can modulate neuronal activities via near&#8208;infrared laser&#8208;irradiated photostimulation (at 980&#160;nm) and thermo&#8208;stimulation (at 808&#160;nm) to realize in vitro neuron control and in vivo modulation of feeding behavior.








Abstract
Optogenetics has been plagued by invasive brain implants and thermal effects during photo&#8208;modulation. Here, two upconversion hybrid nanoparticles modified with photothermal agents, named PT&#8208;UCNP&#8208;B/G, which can modulate neuronal activities via photostimulation and thermo&#8208;stimulation under near&#8208;infrared laser irradiation at 980&#160;nm and 808&#160;nm, respectively, are demonstrated. PT&#8208;UCNP&#8208;B/G emits visible light (410&#8211;500&#160;nm or 500&#8211;570&#160;nm) through the upconversion process at 980&#160;nm, while they exhibit efficient photothermal effect at 808&#160;nm with no visible emission and tissue damage. Intriguingly, PT&#8208;UCNP&#8208;B significantly activates extracellular sodium currents in neuro2a cells expressing light&#8208;gated channelrhodopsin&#8208;2 (ChR2) ion channels under 980&#8208;nm irradiation, and inhibits potassium currents in human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing the voltage&#8208;gated potassium channels (KCNQ1) under 808&#8208;nm irradiation in vitro. Furthermore, deep&#8208;brain bidirectional modulation of feeding behavior is achieved under tether&#8208;free 980 or 808&#8208;nm illumination (0.8&#160;W cm&#8722;2) in mice stereotactically injected with PT&#8208;UCNP&#8208;B in the ChR2&#8208;expressing lateral hypothalamus region. Thus, PT&#8208;UCNP&#8208;B/G creates new possibility of utilizing both light and heat to modulate neural activities and provides a viable strategy to overcome the limits of optogenetics.

The synthesis of multifunctional nanoparticles is commonly a complex endeavor and hampers the clinical translation of effective nanomedicines. The work presents a microfluidic setup based on reactive polypept(o)ides and a combination of slit interdigital micromixers and tangential flow filtration for the continuous production of drug&#8208;loaded corecross&#8208;linked polymeric micelles (CCPMs) in a single precisely controlled process.








Abstract
Translating innovative nanomaterials to medical products requires efficient manufacturing techniques that enable large&#8208;scale high&#8208;throughput synthesis with high reproducibility. Drug carriers in medicine embrace a complex subset of tasks calling for multifunctionality. Here, the synthesisof pro&#8208;drug&#8208;loaded core cross&#8208;linked polymeric micelles (CCPMs) in a continuous flow processis reported, which combines the commonly separated steps of micelle formation, core cross&#8208;linking, functionalization, and purification into a single process. Redox&#8208;responsive CCPMs are formed from thiol&#8208;reactive polypept(o)ides of polysarcosine&#8208;block&#8208;poly(S&#8208;ethylsulfonyl&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine) and functional cross&#8208;linkers based on dihydrolipoic acid hydrazide for pH&#8208;dependent release of paclitaxel. The precisely controlled microfluidic process allows the production of spherical micelles (Dh&#160;= 35&#160;nm) with low polydispersity values (PDI &lt; 0.1) while avoiding toxic organic solvents and additives with unfavorable safety profiles. Self&#8208;assembly and cross&#8208;linking via slit interdigital micromixers produces 350&#8211;700&#160;mg of CCPMs/h per single system, while purification by online tangential flow filtration successfully removes impurities (unimer &#8804; 0.5%). The formed paclitaxel&#8208;loaded CCPMs possess the desired pH&#8208;responsive release profile, display stable drug encapsulation, an improved toxicity profile compared to Abraxane (a trademark of Bristol&#8208;Myers Squibb), and therapeutic efficiency in the B16F1&#8208;xenotransplanted zebrafish model. The combination of reactive polymers, functional cross&#8208;linkers, and microfluidics enables the continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of therapeutically active CCPMs in a single process.

         <title>Optically Tunable Transient Plasmons in InSb Nanowires</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The narrow bandgap and small electron effective mass enable InSb to support plasmons with sensitive optical tunability in the mid&#8208;infrared region. By using the time&#8208;resolved optical nanoscopy, the resonance plasmon is successfully switched in an individual InSb nanowire. By controlling the photoinduced electron yield, a sensitive modulation of the plasmon frequency is achieved by one octave.








Abstract
Optical carrier incubation can effectively alter the electron transport properties of semiconductors; thus, optical switching of the plasmonic response of the semiconductor enables the ultrafast manipulation of the light at the nanoscale. Semiconductor nanostructures are promising platforms in on&#8208;chip high&#8208;speed plasmonic devices, owing to their high photoinduced electron injection efficiency at sub&#8208;picosecond and compatibility with contemporary semiconductor technologies. The pure single crystalline InSb nanowires are promising plasmonic materials in the mid&#8208;infrared region due to their high electron mobility and small electron effective mass. Here, the pump&#8211;probe nanoscopy is utilized to investigate the pump fluence dependency and the dynamics of the non&#8208;equilibrium plasmons in the InSb nanowires. The InSb plasmon is successfully switched by injecting the photoinduced electrons and the practical tuning of the plasmon frequency to one octave is shown by increasing the pump fluence from 0 to 90&#160;&#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2. The density of the photoinduced electrons in InSb nanowires is 18.8&#160;&#215;&#160;1018&#160;cm&#8722;3 with pump fluence as low as 90&#160;&#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2. The high electron mobility of the InSb supports the low&#8208;loss plasmon with a damping rate of &#8776;200&#160;cm&#8722;1. The InSb nanowires&#8217; excellent plasmonic properties ensure that they are a promising platform for upcoming high&#8208;speed mid&#8208;infrared plasmonic materials for informatic devices.

         <title>Membrane&#8208;Fusion&#8208;Mediated Multiplex Engineering of Tumor Cell Surface Glycans for Enhanced NK Cell Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8211;shell membrane&#8208;fusogenic liposome is designed to fuse with tumor cell membrane to deliver sialyltransferase inhibitor&#8208;loaded core into cytoplasm and anchor natural killer (NK)&#8208;activating glycan&#8208;modified shell onto surface synchronously. This membrane&#8208;fusion&#8208;mediated delivery approach reprograms the sialic acid&#8208;caused immunosuppression of tumor surface into a Lewis X trisaccharide&#8208;based NK&#8208;activating type, sufficiently reactivating the NK recognition and lysis for enhanced antitumor therapy.








Abstract
Natural killer (NK) cell therapies show potential for tumor treatment but are immunologically resisted by the overexpressed immunosuppressing tumor cell surface glycans. To reverse this glycan&#8208;mediated immunosuppression, the surface NK&#8208;inhibitory glycan expressions need to be downregulated and NK&#8208;activating glycan levels should be elevated synchronously with optimal efficiency. Here, a core&#8211;shell membrane&#8208;fusogenic liposome (MFL) is designed to simultaneously achieve the physical modification of NK&#8208;activating glycans and biological inhibition of immunosuppressing glycans on the tumor cell surface via a membrane&#8208;fusion manner. Loaded into a tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;triggered&#8208;degradable thermosensitive hydrogel, MFLs could be conveniently injected and controllably released into local tumor. Through fusion with tumor cell membrane, the released MFLs could simultaneously deliver sialyltransferase&#8208;inhibitor&#8208;loaded core into cytoplasm, and anchor NK&#8208;activating&#8208;glycan&#8208;modified shell onto tumor surface. This spatially&#8208;differential distribution of core and shell in one cell ensures the effective inhibition of intracellular sialyltransferase to downregulate immunosuppressing sialic acid, and direct presentation of NK&#8208;activating Lewis X trisaccharide (LeX) on tumor surface simultaneously. Consequentially, the sialic acid&#8208;caused immunosuppression of tumor surface is reprogrammed to be LeX&#8208;induced NK activation, resulting in sensitive susceptibility to NK&#8208;cell&#8208;mediated recognition and lysis for improved tumor elimination. This MFL provides a novel platform for multiplex&#160;cell engineering and personalized regulation of intercellular interactions for enhanced cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Construction of Fluorinated Propane&#8208;Trap in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Record Polymer&#8208;Grade Propylene Production under High Humidity Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the incorporation of &#63743;CF3 groups into the confined pore space, the constructed fluorinated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibit benchmark C3H8/C3H6 separation potential with strong C3H8 binding affinity over C3H6 and exceptional C3H8 uptake capacity. Moreover, the MOFs exhibit high hydrophobicity and good moisture stability, indicating potential applications in efficient C3H8/C3H6 separation under actual conditions with vapour.








Abstract
Propane/propene (C3H8/C3H6) separation is essential in the petrochemical industry but challenging because of their similar physical and chemical properties. Adsorptive separation with C3H8&#8208;selective porous materials can energy&#8208;efficiently produce high&#8208;purity C3H6, which is highly promising for replacing conventional cryogenic distillation but suffers from unsatisfactory performance. Herein, through the precise incorporation of fluorinated functional groups into the confined pore space, a new fluorinated metal&#8211;organic framework&#160;(FDMOF&#8208;2) featuring the unique and strong C3H8&#8208;trap is successfully constructed. FDMOF&#8208;2 exhibits an unprecedented C3H8 capture capacity of 140 cm3 cm&#8722;3 and excellent C3H8/C3H6 (1:1, v/v) selectivity up to 2.18 (298 K and 1&#160;bar), thus setting new benchmarks for all reported porous materials. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies reveal that the tailored pore confinement in FDMOF&#8208;2 provides stronger and multiple attractive interactions with C3H8, enabling excellent binding affinities. Breakthrough experiments demonstrate that C3H8 can be directly extracted from various C3H8/C3H6 mixtures with FDMOF&#8208;2, affording an outstanding C3H6 production (501&#160;mmol L&#8722;1) with over 99.99% purity. Benefiting from the robust framework and hydrophobic ligands, the separation performance of FDMOF&#8208;2 can be well maintained even under 70% relative humidity conditions.

&lt;p&gt;With the incorporation of &lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; groups into the confined pore space, the constructed fluorinated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibit benchmark C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; separation potential with strong C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; binding affinity over C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and exceptional C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; uptake capacity. Moreover, the MOFs exhibit high hydrophobicity and good moisture stability, indicating potential applications in efficient C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; separation under actual conditions with vapour.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Propane/propene (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) separation is essential in the petrochemical industry but challenging because of their similar physical and chemical properties. Adsorptive separation with C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;-selective porous materials can energy-efficiently produce high-purity C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, which is highly promising for replacing conventional cryogenic distillation but suffers from unsatisfactory performance. Herein, through the precise incorporation of fluorinated functional groups into the confined pore space, a new fluorinated metal&#8211;organic framework&#160;(FDMOF-2) featuring the unique and strong C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;-trap is successfully constructed. FDMOF-2 exhibits an unprecedented C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; capture capacity of 140 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; and excellent C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (1:1, v/v) selectivity up to 2.18 (298 K and 1&#160;bar), thus setting new benchmarks for all reported porous materials. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies reveal that the tailored pore confinement in FDMOF-2 provides stronger and multiple attractive interactions with C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, enabling excellent binding affinities. Breakthrough experiments demonstrate that C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; can be directly extracted from various C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; mixtures with FDMOF-2, affording an outstanding C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; production (501&#160;mmol L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) with over 99.99% purity. Benefiting from the robust framework and hydrophobic ligands, the separation performance of FDMOF-2 can be well maintained even under 70% relative humidity conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Spin Current in Ni81Fe19/Cu&#8211;CuOx Bilayer with Top and Sideways Oxidization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sizeable spin current with strong out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization component can be generated and transmitted in Ni81Fe19/Cu&#8211;CuOx bilayer with sideways and top oxidizations based on the spin&#8208;vorticity coupling. The charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin current conversion can be manipulated by changing the annealing temperature, time, and the Hall&#8208;bar channel width, providing a novel approach to developing efficient spintronic devices.








Abstract
Generation and manipulation of spin current are the cores of spintronic devices, which are intensely pursued. Heavy metals with strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling are commonly used for the generation of spin current, but are&#160;incompatible with the mass production of devices, and the polarization of spin current is limited to be in&#8208;plane. Here, it is shown that the spin current with strong out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization component can be generated and transmitted in Ni81Fe19/Cu&#8211;CuOx bilayer with sideways and top oxidizations. The charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin current conversion efficiency can be enhanced through the spin currents consisting of both out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization (&#963;z) and in&#8208;plane polarization (&#963;y) induced by spin&#8208;vorticity coupling. Such a spin current is demonstrated to be closely related to the lateral oxidization gradient and can be controlled by changing the temperatures and times of annealing. The finding here provides a novel degree of freedom to produce and control the spin current in spintronic devices.

         <title>Sound&#8208;Speed Modifying Acoustic Metasurfaces for Acoustic Holography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin metasurface approach utilizing planarized micropillars in discrete phase arrays is demonstrated, and&#160;which is easily fabricated by a&#160;single&#8208;step etching process. This metasurface demonstrates flexibility in the generation of complex acoustic patterns by acoustic holography and has broad potential in applications including high&#8208;frequency acoustic manipulation in microfluidics, cell/tissue engineering, and medical ultrasound.








Abstract
Acoustic metasurfaces offer unique capabilities to steer and direct acoustic fields, though these are generally composed of complex 3D structures, complicating their fabrication and applicability to higher frequencies. Here, an ultrathin metasurface approach is demonstrated,&#160;wherein&#160;planarized micropillars in a discretized phase array&#160;are&#160;utilized. This subwavelength metasurface is easily produced via a single&#8208;step etching process and is suitable for megahertz&#8208;scale applications. The flexibility of this approach is further demonstrated in the production of complex acoustic patterns via acoustic holography. This metasurface approach, with models used to predict their behavior, has broad potential in applications where robust, high&#8208;frequency acoustic manipulation is required, including microfluidics, cell/tissue engineering, and medical ultrasound.

         <title>X&#8208;ray&#8208;Guided In Situ Genetic Engineering of Macrophages for Sustained Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An X&#8208;ray&#8208;guided and triggered remote control of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome&#8208;editing strategy is reported, to specifically and permanently repolarize TAMs toward M1 phenotype without reconversion by blocking CSF1&#8208;R and SIRP&#945; expressions both in vitro and in vivo, thereby inducing the phagocytosis of tumor cells and eliciting robust antitumor immunity, while reducing systemic toxicities.








Abstract
Effective repolarization of macrophages has emerged as a promising approach for anticancer therapy. However, there are very few studies on the effect of reprogramming macrophages from M2 phenotype to M1 phenotype without reconversion while maintaining an activated M1 phenotype. Moreover, these immunomodulatory methods have serious drawbacks due to the activation of normal monocytic cells. Therefore, it remains a challenge to selectively reprogram tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) without systemic toxicities. Here, X&#8208;ray&#8208;guided and triggered remote control of a CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system (X&#8208;CC9) that exclusively activates therapeutic agents at tumor sites is established. Under X&#8208;ray irradiation, X&#8208;CC9 selectively enhances M2&#8208;to&#8208;M1 repolarization within the tumor microenvironment, and significantly improves antitumor efficacy with robust immune responses in two animal models. This strategy provides an ideal method for improving the safety of macrophage polarization and may constitute a promising immunotherapy strategy.

         <title>Simultaneous Oxidative Cleavage of Lignin and Reduction of Furfural via Efficient Electrocatalysis by P&#8208;Doped CoMoO4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
P&#8208;doping&#8208;induced lattice growth of CoMoO4 increases crystal defects and causes the D&#8208;band center to migrate higher to obtain the appropriate adsorption energy and significantly lower overpotential, therefore this system performs well in lignin oxidation breakage and furfural reduction.








Abstract
Electrochemical oxidative lignin cleavage and coupled 2&#8208;furaldehyde reduction provide a promising approach for producing high&#8208;value added products. However, developing efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts with noble&#8208;metal&#8208;like activity still remains a challenge. Here, an efficient electrochemical strategy is reported for the selective oxidative cleavage of C&#945;&#8211;C&#946; bonds in lignin into aromatic monomers by tailoring the electronic structure through P&#8208;doped CoMoO4 spinels (99% conversion, highest monomer selectivity of 56%). Additionally, the conversion and selectivity of 2&#8208;furaldehyde reduction to 2&#8208;methyl furan reach 87% and 73%, respectively. In situ Fourier transform infrared and density functional theory analysis reveal that an upward shift of the Ed upon P&#8208;doping leads to an increase in the antibonding level, which facilitates the C&#945;&#8211;C&#946; adsorption of the lignin model compounds, thereby enhancing the bifunctional electrocatalytic activity of the active site. This work explores the potential of a spinel as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for the oxidative cracking of lignin and the reductive conversion of small organic molecules to high&#8208;value added chemicals via P&#8208;anion modulation.

&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; upon P-doping leads to an increase in the antibonding level, which facilitates the C&lt;sub&gt;&#945;&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;C&lt;sub&gt;&#946;&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption of the lignin model compounds, thereby enhancing the bifunctional electrocatalytic activity of the active site. This work explores the potential of a spinel as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for the oxidative cracking of lignin and the reductive conversion of small organic molecules to high-value added chemicals via P-anion modulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Melt Electrowriting of Liquid Crystal Elastomer Scaffolds with Programmed Mechanical Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Melt electrowriting of liquid crystal elastomers is developed to generate ultrafine fibers with built&#8208;in digitally&#160;defined anisotropy. Square lattice&#160;and other more complex scaffolds with structural features and dimensions hardly accessible with conventional extrusion&#8208;based printing techniques, as well as mechanical response to temperature, are demonstrated with this technique.








Abstract
Recently, significant advances have been achieved to precisely program the response of liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) through extrusion&#8208;based additive manufacturing techniques; however, important challenges remain, especially when well&#8208;defined scaffolds based on ultrafine fibers are required. Here the melt electrowriting of reactive liquid crystalline inks, leading, after ultraviolet&#8208;light&#8208;induced crosslinking, to digitally positioned uniform LCE fibers with diameters ranging from hundreds of nanometers to tens of micrometers is presented, which&#160;is&#160;hardly accessible with conventional extrusion&#8208;based printing techniques. The electrowriting process induces the preferential alignment of the mesogens parallel to the fiber's axis. Such an alignment, defined by the printing path, determines the mechanical response of the crosslinked material upon stimulation. This manufacturing platform allows the preparation of open square lattice scaffolds with ultrafine fibers (a&#160;few micrometers in diameter), periods as small as 90&#160;&#181;m, and well&#8208;defined morphology. Additionally, the combination of accurate fiber stacking (up to 50 layers) and fiber fusion between layers leads to unprecedented microstructures composed of high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio LCE thin walls. The possibility of digitally controlling the printing of fibers allows the preparation complex fiber&#8208;based scaffolds with programmed and reversible shape&#8208;morphing, thus opening new avenues to prepare miniaturized actuators and smart structures for soft robotics and biomedical applications.

         <title>Substitutional p&#8208;Type Doping in NbS2&#8211;MoS2 Lateral Heterostructures Grown by MOCVD</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
p&#8208;Type NbS2&#8211;MoS2 lateral heterostructures with a high on/off current ratio are synthesized by a&#160;one&#8208;step metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) method with Nb dopants present in the&#160;monolayer MoS2. The heterostructure provides a platform to explore the instructive interface of substitutional doped TMDC materials and 2D metal&#8211;semiconductor heterojunctions, which paves a prospective way to designing innovative nanoscale devices and complementary&#160;metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor&#160;(CMOS)&#8208;like 2D circuits.








Abstract
Monolayer MoS2 has attracted significant attention owing to its excellent performance as an n&#8208;type semiconductor from the transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) family. It is however strongly desired to develop controllable synthesis methods for 2D p&#8208;type MoS2, which is crucial for complementary logic applications but remains difficult. In this work, high&#8208;quality NbS2&#8211;MoS2 lateral heterostructures are synthesized by one&#8208;step metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) together with monolayer MoS2 substitutionally doped by Nb, resulting in a p&#8208;type doped behavior. The heterojunction shows a p&#8208;type transfer characteristic with a high on/off current ratio of &#8776;104, exceeding previously reported values. The band structure through the NbS2&#8211;MoS2 heterojunction is investigated by density functional theory (DFT) and quantum transport simulations. This work provides a scalable approach to synthesize substitutionally doped TMDC materials and provides an insight into the interface between 2D metals and semiconductors in lateral heterostructures, which is imperative for the development of next&#8208;generation nanoelectronics and highly integrated devices.

         <title>Reconfigurable Electrical Networks within a Conductive Hydrogel Composite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft conductors coupled with reversible electrical conductivity can enable new functions in wearable electronics and soft robotics. In&#160;this&#160;work, a reconfigurable conductive hydrogel composite is developed, which is made of silver flakes, polyacrylamide, and alginate hydrogel. By simply applying dehydration and rehydration treatments, the material can achieve reversible electrical conductivity. This reconfigurability can help the material to recover from severe damage or control locomotion of a legged robot.








Abstract
Soft materials that exhibit compliance, programmability, and reconfigurability can have a transformative impact as electronic skin for applications in wearable electronics/soft robotics. There has been significant progress in soft conductive materials; however, achieving electrically&#160;controlled and reversible changes in conductivity and circuit connectivity remains challenging. To overcome this limitation, a&#160;soft material architecture with reconfigurable conductive networks of silver flakes embedded within a hydrogel matrix is presented. The conductive networks can be reversibly created/disconnected through various stimuli, including current, humidity, or temperature. Such stimuli affect electrical connectivity of the hydrogel by controlling its water content, which can be modulated by evaporation under ambient conditions (passive dehydration), evaporation through electrical Joule heating (active dehydration), or absorption of additional water (rehydration). The resulting change in electrical conductivity is reversible and repeatable, endowing the composite with on&#8208;demand reconfigurable conductivity. To highlight this material's unique properties, it is shown that conductive traces can be reconfigured after severe damage and revert to lower conductivity after rehydration. Additionally, a quadruped robot is demonstrated that can respond to stimuli by changing direction following exposure to excess water, thereby achieving reprogrammable locomotion behaviors.

         <title>Scalable Manufacturing of Mechanical Robust Bioinspired Ceramic&#8211;Resin Composites with Locally Tunable Heterogeneous Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By developing a simple bottom&#8208;up assembly approach, nacre&#8208;like ceramic&#8211;resin composites with tunable heterogeneous architectures are scalably manufactured. The composites are designed with a strong and tough nacre&#8208;like main body, and a stiff and hard surface layer bonded by a gradient interlayer to alleviate property mismatch. This structural design achieves an impressive combination of low density and multiple desired mechanical properties.








Abstract
Lightweight structural materials with a unique combination of high stiffness, strength, toughness, and hardness, are highly&#160;desired yet challenging to be artificially fabricated. Biological structural materials, on the other hand, ingeniously integrate multiple mutually exclusive mechanical properties together relying on their hierarchically heterogeneous structures bonded with gradient interfaces. Here, a scalable bottom&#8208;up approach combining continuous nanofiber&#8208;assisted evaporation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly with laminating, pressure&#8208;less sintering and resin infiltration is reported to fabricate bioinspired heterogeneous ceramic&#8211;resin composites with locally&#160;tunable microstructure to fulfill specific properties. A gradient interlayer is&#160;introduced to provide a gradual transition between adjacent heterogeneous layers, effectively alleviating their property mismatch. The optimized heterogeneous nacre&#8208;like composite, as a demonstration, exhibits an attractive combination of low density (&#8776;2.8&#160;g&#160;cm&#8722;3), high strength (&#8776;292&#160;MPa), toughness (&#8776;6.4&#160;MPa&#160;m1/2), surface hardness (&#8776;1144 kgf&#160;mm&#8722;2) and impact&#8208;resistance, surpassing the overall performance of engineering alumina. This material&#8208;independent approach paves the way for designing advanced bioinspired heterogeneous materials for diverse structural and functional applications.

         <title>Water Spider&#8208;Inspired Nanofiber Coating with Sustainable Scale Repellency via Air&#8208;Replenishing Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by water spiders, an underwater superaerophilic nanofiber coating is developed to display excellent and sustainable scalephobic capability. Through appropriate replenishment, air film on the coating can be well stabilized and serves as a barrier layer to reduce the deposition of scale. Compared with reported results, the water spider&#8208;inspired coating significantly surpasses them in both longevity and efficiency.








Abstract
To survive underwater even in severely hypoxic water for a long period, the&#160;water spider has to periodically collect and replenish air into the diving bell. Inspired by this natural air&#8208;replenishing strategy, a water spider&#8208;inspired nanofiber (WSN) coating with underwater superaerophilicity displaying excellent and sustainable scalephobic capability is prepared. Air film on the WSN coating can be well&#8208;kept and further employed as the barrier layer for scale repellence. Significantly, scalephobic capability of the WSN coating mainly originates from two aspects: inhibiting interfacial nucleation and reducing interfacial adhesion of scale. Compared with previous studies, this WSN coating achieves excellent and sustainable scale repellence (&#8776; 98% reduction in scale deposition) even after a one&#8208;month dynamic scaling test. Thus, this air&#8208;replenishing strategy may raise a new avenue for advanced long&#8208;term scalephobic materials.

         <title>Extracting Polaron Recombination from Electroluminescence in Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes by Artificial Intelligence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extraction of polaron dynamics from EL in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes is realized by AI. The quantitative understanding of polaron dynamics in complicated light&#8208;emitting processes is facilitated by predicting the recombination coefficient.








Abstract
Direct exploring the electroluminescence (EL) of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) is a challenge due to the complicated processes of polarons, excitons, and their interactions. This study demonstrated the extraction of the polaron dynamics from transient EL by predicting the recombination coefficient via artificial intelligence, overcoming multivariable kinetics problems. The performance of a machine learning (ML) model trained by various EL decay curves is significantly improved using a novel featurization method and input node optimization, achieving an R2 value of 0.947. The optimized ML model successfully predicts the recombination coefficients of actual OLEDs based on an exciplex&#8208;forming cohost, enabling the quantitative understanding of the overall polaron behavior under various electrical excitation conditions.

         <title>Orthogonal Photochemistry toward Direct Encryption of a 3D&#8208;Printed Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Encryption on a 3D hydrogel is achieved by orthogonal photochemistry. The visible&#8208;light&#8208;based 3D printing can fabricate hydrogels into complex geometries, and the further UV irradiation is employed to encode the information on the gel surface. This strategy for product anti&#8208;counterfeiting with high security paves the way for more reliable encryption.








Abstract
Encryption technologies are essential for information security and product anti&#8208;counterfeiting, but they are typically restricted to planar surfaces. Encryption on complex 3D objects offers great potential to further improve security. However, it is rarely achieved owing to the lack of encoding strategies for nonplanar surfaces. Here, an approach is reported to directly encrypt on a 3D&#8208;printed object employing orthogonal photochemistry. In this system, visible light photochemistry is used for 3D printing of a hydrogel, and ultraviolet light is subsequently employed to activate its geometrically complex surface through the dissociation of ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl ester units in a spatioselective manner for information coding. This approach offers a new way for more reliable encryption, and the underlying orthogonal photochemistry can be extended toward functional modification of 3D&#8208;printed products beyond information protection.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel quaternary p&#8208;type 2D semiconductor, CuBiP2Se6, is introduced into the 2D family, exhibiting a high work function of 5.26&#160;eV, hole mobility of 1.72 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, and ultrahigh on/off ratio exceeding 106. In particular, CuBiP2Se6&#8208;based fully vertical van der Waals devices exhibit outstanding comprehensive optoelectronic performance, which is comparable to that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 2D devices.








Abstract
The notable lack of intrinsic p&#8208;type 2D layered semiconductors has hindered the engineering of 2D devices for complementary metal oxide semiconductors (CMOSs). Herein, a novel quaternary intrinsic p&#8208;type 2D semiconductor, CuBiP2Se6 atomic layers, is introduced into&#160;the&#160;2D family. The semiconductor displays a high work function of 5.26&#160;eV, a moderate hole mobility of 1.72 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, and an ultrahigh on/off current exceeding 106 at room temperature. To date, 5.26&#160;eV is the highest work&#8208;function recorded in p&#8208;type 2D materials, indicating the ultrastable p&#8208;type behavior of CuBiP2Se6. Additionally, a multilayer graphene/CuBiP2Se6/multilayer graphene (MLG/CBPS/MLG)&#8208;based fully vertical van der Waals heterostructure phototransistor is designed and fabricated. This device exhibits outstanding optoelectronic performance with a responsivity (R) of 4.9 &#215;&#160;104 A W&#8722;1, an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1.5 &#215;&#160;107%, a detectivity (D) of 1.14 &#215;&#160;1013 Jones, and a broad working wavelength (400&#8211;1100&#160;nm), respectively. This is comparable&#160;to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 2D devices. Such excellent performance is attributed to the ultrashort transmit length and nondestructive/defect&#8208;free contacts. This leads to faster response speed and eliminates Fermi&#8208;level&#160;pinning&#160;effects. Moreover, ultrahigh responsivity and detectivity endow the device with applaudable imaging sensing capability. These results make CuBiP2Se6 an ideal p&#8208;type candidate material for next&#8208;generation CMOSs logic devices.

         <title>Orally Administrable H2S&#8208;Scavenging Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Prepared by Co&#8208;Flow Microfluidics for Comprehensive Restoration of Intestinal Milieu</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A theranostic nanoplatform is synthesized to scavenge and detect H2S to recover intestinal barrier damaged by inflammatory bowel diseases. Nanoplatform is prepared by encapsulation of UiO&#8208;66 with a CR probe (UR) in pH&#8208;responsive hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS) done via microfluidic. Following oral administration, HPMCAS dissolves to expose UR NPs at the inflamed intestine which adsorbs and detects H2S.








Abstract
Intestinal milieu disorders are strongly related to the occurrence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), which results from mucosa destruction, epithelium disruption, and tight junction (TJ) proteins loss. Excess of H2S in the intestinal milieu produced by the&#160;sulfate&#8208;reducing bacteria metabolism contributes to&#160;development of&#160;IBDs via epithelial barrier breakdown. Conventional interventions, such as surgery and anti&#8208;inflammatory medications, are considered not completely effective because of frequent recurrence and other complications. Herein, a novel oral delivery system, a hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS)&#8208;based polymer&#8208;coated Zr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (UiO&#8208;66) with a Cux&#8208;rhodamine B (CR) probe (hereinafter referred to as HUR), is produced via&#160;a&#160;co&#8208;flow microfluidic approach with the ability to reduce H2S levels, thus restoring the intestinal lumen milieu. HPMCAS serves as an enteric coating that exposes UiO&#8208;66@CR at the pH of the intestine but not the acidic pH of the stomach. The synthesized HUR exhibits notable therapeutic efficacy, including mucosa recovery, epithelium integrity restoration, and TJ proteins upregulation via H2S scavenging to protect against intestinal barrier damage and microbiome dysbiosis. Thus, HUR is verified to be a promising theranostic platform able to decrease the H2S content for intestinal milieu disorder treatment. The presented study therefore opens the door for further exploitation for IBDs therapy.

&lt;p&gt;A theranostic nanoplatform is synthesized to scavenge and detect H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S to recover intestinal barrier damaged by inflammatory bowel diseases. Nanoplatform is prepared by encapsulation of UiO-66 with a CR probe (UR) in pH-responsive hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS) done via microfluidic. Following oral administration, HPMCAS dissolves to expose UR NPs at the inflamed intestine which adsorbs and detects H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intestinal milieu disorders are strongly related to the occurrence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), which results from mucosa destruction, epithelium disruption, and tight junction (TJ) proteins loss. Excess of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S in the intestinal milieu produced by the&#160;sulfate-reducing bacteria metabolism contributes to&#160;development of&#160;IBDs via epithelial barrier breakdown. Conventional interventions, such as surgery and anti-inflammatory medications, are considered not completely effective because of frequent recurrence and other complications. Herein, a novel oral delivery system, a hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS)-based polymer-coated Zr-based metal&#8211;organic framework (UiO-66) with a Cu&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-rhodamine B (CR) probe (hereinafter referred to as HUR), is produced via&#160;a&#160;co-flow microfluidic approach with the ability to reduce H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S levels, thus restoring the intestinal lumen milieu. HPMCAS serves as an enteric coating that exposes UiO-66@CR at the pH of the intestine but not the acidic pH of the stomach. The synthesized HUR exhibits notable therapeutic efficacy, including mucosa recovery, epithelium integrity restoration, and TJ proteins upregulation via H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S scavenging to protect against intestinal barrier damage and microbiome dysbiosis. Thus, HUR is verified to be a promising theranostic platform able to decrease the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S content for intestinal milieu disorder treatment. The presented study therefore opens the door for further exploitation for IBDs therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Human Brain Assembloids by Microfluidics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel microfluidic system is presented for the spatially controlled patterning of human&#8208;brain region&#8208;specific organoids, allowing for the efficient, scalable, and flexible generation of brain assembloids. Therefore, this microfluidic system has remarkable potential in wide applications of assembloid technology in neurological and biomedical fields.








Abstract
Brain assembloids offer a highly promising strategy to model human brain development and disease, and advance potential studies in regenerative medicine, therapeutic screening, and drug discovery, while it is challenging to produce uniform brain organoids and assemble them flexibly by conventional methods. Here, a multidisciplinary engineered strategy to generate human brain assembloids with desired patterning based on microfluidic technology&#160;is presented. By encapsulating human induced pluripotent stem cells in microcapsules via microfluidic electrospray, brain region&#8208;specific organoids are efficiently formed, which are then introduced into a microfluidic chip consisting of a bottom layer with a micropillar array and a movable upper layer with a complementary microhole array. These brain organoids can settle into microholes and fuse into brain assembloids. As varied organoid microcapsules with designed 1D sequences or 2D arrays can be assembled into the vertical microholes, large coding amounts of fused brain assembloids with desired patterning can be produced. It is found that brain assembloids composed of cortical, hippocampal, and thalamic organoids can grow and function well, characterized with active neural migration and interaction. These features indicate that the suggested flexible, scalable, and controlled microfluidic systems are remarkably potential in wide applications of brain assembloids in neurological and biomedical fields.

         <title>A&#160;pH&#8208;Activatable Copper&#8208;Biomineralized Proenzyme for Synergistic Chemodynamic/Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy against Aggressive Cancers</title>

         <dc:description>
Peroxidase&#8208;like biomineralized copper (II) carbonate hydroxide nanocrystals inside single albumin nanocages (CuCH&#8208;NCs) are&#160;found&#160;to&#160;act as a pH&#8208;activatable proenzyme to achieve tumor&#8208;selective and synergistic chemodynamic/chemo&#8208;immunotherapy against aggressive triple&#8208;negative breast cancers (TNBCs).








Abstract
Artificial enzymes have demonstrated therapeutic benefits against diverse malignant tumors, yet their antitumor potencies are still severely compromised by non&#8208;selective catalysis, low atomic&#8208;utilization efficiency, and undesired off&#8208;target toxicity. Herein, it is reported that peroxidase&#8208;like biomineralized copper (II) carbonate hydroxide nanocrystals inside single albumin nanocages (CuCH&#8208;NCs) act as a pH&#8208;activatable proenzyme to achieve tumor&#8208;selective and synergistic chemodynamic/chemo&#8208;immunotherapy against aggressive triple&#8208;negative breast cancers (TNBCs). These CuCH&#8208;NCs show pH&#8208;sensitive Cu2+ release, which spontaneously undergoes glutathione (GSH)&#8208;mediated reduction into Cu+ species for catalyzing the evolution of H2O2 into hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH)&#160;in a single&#8208;atom&#8208;like manner to cause chemodynamic cell injury, and simultaneously activates non&#8208;toxic disulfiram to cytotoxic complex for yielding selective chemotherapeutic damage via blocking cell proliferation and amplifying cell apoptosis. CuCH&#8208;NCs exhibit considerable tumor&#8208;targeting capacity with deep penetration depth, thus affording preferable efficacy against orthotopic breast tumors&#160;through synergistic chemodynamic/chemotherapy, together with good in vivo safety. Moreover, CuCH&#8208;NCs arouse distinct immunogenic cell death effect and upregulate PD&#8208;L1 expression upon disulfiram combination, and thus synergize with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody to activate adaptive and innate immunities, together with relieving immunosuppression, finally yielding potent antitumor efficacy against both primary and metastatic TNBCs. These results provide insights into smart and high&#8208;performance proenzymes for synergistic therapy against aggressive cancers.

         <title>Vanadium Oxide&#8208;Doped Laser&#8208;Induced Graphene Multi&#8208;Parameter Sensor to Decouple Soil Nitrogen Loss and Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly porous 3D vanadium oxide&#8208;doped laser&#8208;induced graphene (LIG) foam composite is readily obtained by laser scribing vanadium sulfide&#8208;doped block copolymer and phenolic resin self&#8208;assembled films. The resulting foam composite provides a high&#8208;performance multi&#8208;parameter sensor to completely decouple nitrogen oxides and temperature, allowing for accurate detection of nitrogen loss and soil temperature for precision agriculture.








Abstract
Monitoring nitrogen utilization efficiency and soil temperature in agricultural systems for timely intervention is essential for crop health&#160;with reduced environmental pollution. Herein, this work presents a high&#8208;performance multi&#8208;parameter sensor based on vanadium oxide (VOX)&#8208;doped laser&#8208;induced graphene (LIG) foam to completely decouple nitrogen oxides (NOX) and temperature. The highly porous 3D VOX&#8208;doped LIG foam composite is readily obtained by laser scribing vanadium sulfide (V5S8)&#8208;doped block copolymer and phenolic resin self&#8208;assembled films. The heterojunction formed at the LIG/VOX interface provides the sensor with enhanced response to NOX and an ultralow limit of detection of 3 ppb (theoretical estimate of 451 ppt) at room temperature. The sensor also exhibits a wide detection range, fast response/recovery, good selectivity, and stability over 16 days. Meanwhile, the sensor can accurately detect temperature over a wide linear range of 10&#8211;110&#160;&#176;C. The encapsulation of the sensor with a soft membrane further allows for temperature sensing without being affected by NOX. The unencapsulated sensor operated at elevated temperature removes the influences of relative humidity and temperature variations for accurate NOX measurements. The capability to decouple nitrogen loss and soil temperature&#160;paves the way for the development of future multimodal decoupled electronics for precision agriculture and health monitoring.

         <title>Boosting Photocatalytic Water Oxidation on Photocatalysts with Ferroelectric Single Domains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
As&#8208;prepared BiFeO3 nanosheets are confirmed as ferroelectric single domains, and their potential in photocatalysis is identified by comparison&#160;with polydomain particles. Selective deposition of cocatalysts further boosts the photocatalytic activity of single&#8208;domain BiFeO3 nanosheets. The superiority of the&#160;single&#8208;domain structures in ferroelectric photocatalysts is emphasized, which offers a path to utilize the energetic photogenerated charges in solar energy conversion.








Abstract
Ferroelectric materials are considered as promising photocatalysts due to their efficient charge separation via a&#160;polarization&#8208;induced built&#8208;in electric field. However, the polydomain structures hinder spatial charge separation and transfer due to the cancellation of polarization vectors in the domains. In&#160;this&#160;work, taking BiFeO3 (BFO) as a prototype, single&#8208;domain BFO nanosheets with visible&#8208;light absorption are prepared, as evident by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), spatially resolved surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SRSPS), and photodeposition experiments. The single&#8208;domain BFO nanosheets show nine times activity in photocatalytic water oxidation reaction under visible&#8208;light irradiation, compared with that of the polydomain BFO particles. With the asymmetric driving force for charge separation in a single domain, selective deposition of cocatalysts further enhances the photocatalytic activity of single&#8208;domain ferroelectric BFO nanosheets. These results demonstrate the role of the&#160;single&#8208;domain structure in constructing the driving force of charge separation in ferroelectric photocatalysts. The fabrication of single&#8208;domain structures in ferroelectric photocatalysts to achieve enhanced photocatalytic activity offers a path to efficiently utilize the photogenerated charges in solar energy conversion.

Selective deposition of cocatalysts further boosts the photocatalytic activity of single-domain BiFeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets. The superiority of the&#160;single-domain structures in ferroelectric photocatalysts is emphasized, which offers a path to utilize the energetic photogenerated charges in solar energy conversion.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroelectric materials are considered as promising photocatalysts due to their efficient charge separation via a&#160;polarization-induced built-in electric field. However, the polydomain structures hinder spatial charge separation and transfer due to the cancellation of polarization vectors in the domains. In&#160;this&#160;work, taking BiFeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (BFO) as a prototype, single-domain BFO nanosheets with visible-light absorption are prepared, as evident by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), spatially resolved surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SRSPS), and photodeposition experiments. The single-domain BFO nanosheets show nine times activity in photocatalytic water oxidation reaction under visible-light irradiation, compared with that of the polydomain BFO particles. With the asymmetric driving force for charge separation in a single domain, selective deposition of cocatalysts further enhances the photocatalytic activity of single-domain ferroelectric BFO nanosheets. These results demonstrate the role of the&#160;single-domain structure in constructing the driving force of charge separation in ferroelectric photocatalysts. The fabrication of single-domain structures in ferroelectric photocatalysts to achieve enhanced photocatalytic activity offers a path to efficiently utilize the photogenerated charges in solar energy conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlled Adhesion of Ice&#8212;Toward Ultraclean 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel ice&#8208;aided transfer, ice&#8208;stamp transfer, and ice cleaning methods, completely free from polymer and solvents, are developed to yield ultrahigh quality and exceptional cleanliness in 2D materials, which&#160;will&#160;contribute&#160;to technological revolutions in 2D materials, and their associated structures and devices.








Abstract
The scalable 2D&#160;device fabrication and integration demand either the large&#8208;area synthesis or the post&#8208;synthesis transfer of 2D layers. While the direct synthesis of 2D materials on most targeted surfaces remains challenging, the transfer approach from the growth substrate onto the targeted surfaces offers an alternative pathway for applications and integrations. However, the current transfer techniques for 2D materials predominantly involve polymers and organic solvents, which are liable to contaminate or deform the ultrasensitive atomic layers. Here, novel ice&#8208;aided transfer and ice&#8208;stamp transfer methods are developed, in which water (ice) is the only medium in the entire process. In practice, the adhesion between various 2D materials and ice can be well controlled by temperature. Through such controlled adhesion of ice, it is shown that the new transfer methods can yield ultrahigh quality and exceptional cleanliness in transferred 2D flakes and continuous 2D films, and are applicable for a wide range of substrates. Furthermore, beyond transfer, ice can also be used for cleaning the surfaces of 2D materials at higher temperatures. These novel techniques can enable unprecedented ultraclean 2D materials surfaces and performances, and will contribute to the upcoming technological revolutions associated with 2D materials.

         <title>Active Textile Fabrics from Weaving Liquid Crystalline Elastomer Filaments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crafting of active fabrics incorporating liquid crystalline elastomer (LCE) yarn&#160;is&#160;reported. Two types of LCE yarns with different elasticities enable over 10% reversible actuation strain on repeated heating cycles and blocking force of &#8776;1&#8211;2&#160;N&#160;cm&#8722;1.








Abstract
Active fabrics, responding autonomously to environmental changes, are the &#8220;Holy Grail&#8221; of the development of smart textiles. Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) promise to be the base materials for large&#8208;stroke reversible actuation. The mechanical behavior of LCEs matches almost exactly the human muscle. Yet, it has not been&#160;possible to produce filaments from LCEs that will be suitable for standard textile production methods, such as weaving. Based on the recent development of LCE fibers, here, the crafting of active fabrics incorporating LCE yarn, woven on a standard loom, giving control over the weave density and structure, is presented. Two types of LCE yarns (soft and stiff) and their incorporation into several weaving patterns are tested, and the &#8220;champions&#8221; identified: the twill pattern with stiffer LCE yarn that shows the greatest blocking force of 1&#8211;2&#160;N&#160;cm&#8722;1 , and the weft rib pattern with over 10% reversible actuation strain on repeated heating cycles. Reversible 3D shape changes of active fabric utilize the circular weaving patterns that lead to cone shapes upon heating. The seamless combination of active LCE yarns into the rich portfolio of existing passive yarns can be transformative in creating new stimuli&#8208;responsive actuating textiles.

         <title>Ambient Electrosynthesis toward Single&#8208;Atom Sites for Electrocatalytic Green Hydrogen Cycling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent progress in ambient electrosynthesis toward single&#8208;atom sites ranging from nonprecious Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, V, Cr, Mn, Sn, Pd, and Bi to noble Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Ir, Pt, and Au for green hydrogen cycling is reviewed, and further opportunities are discussed. Three electrosynthesis strategies including electrochemical etching, direct electrodeposition, and electrochemical leaching&#8211;redeposition&#160;are&#160;summarized.








Abstract
With the ultimate atomic utilization, well&#8208;defined configuration of active sites and unique electronic properties, catalysts with single&#8208;atom sites (SASs) exhibit appealing performance for electrocatalytic green hydrogen generation from water splitting and further utilization via hydrogen&#8211;oxygen fuel cells, such that a vast majority of synthetic strategies toward SAS&#8208;based catalysts (SASCs) are exploited. In particular, room&#8208;temperature electrosynthesis under atmospheric pressure offers a novel, safe, and effective route to access SASs. Herein, the recent progress in ambient electrosynthesis toward SASs for electrocatalytic sustainable hydrogen generation and utilization, and future opportunities are discussed. A systematic summary is started on three kinds of ambient electrochemically synthetic routes for SASs, including electrochemical etching (ECE), direct electrodeposition (DED), and electrochemical leaching&#8211;redeposition (ELR), associated with advanced characterization techniques. Next, their electrocatalytic applications for hydrogen energy conversion including hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, overall water splitting, and oxygen reduction reaction are reviewed. Finally, a brief conclusion and remarks&#160;on future challenges regarding further development of ambient electrosynthesis of high&#8208;performance and cost&#8208;effective SASCs for many other electrocatalytic applications are presented.

         <title>A&#160;Wafer&#8208;Scale Nanoporous 2D Active Pixel Image Sensor Matrix with High Uniformity, High Sensitivity, and Rapid Switching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasensitive and robust active&#8208;matrix image sensor circuitry is demonstrated by integrating a wafer&#8208;scale nanoporous molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) phototransistor array with high&#8208;performance indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc oxide (IGZO) switching transistors. A 4&#8208;inch wafer&#8208;scale 2D)MoS2 is synthesized and a periodic nanopore array is created on its surface to achieve exceptionally high photoresponsivity of 5.2 &#215; 104 A W&#8722;1. The device shows a technically advanced form based on large&#8208;area 2D material similar to a commercialized complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor consisting of a sensor and a driving transistor in the matrix pixel.








Abstract
2D transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have&#160;been successfully developed as novel ubiquitous optoelectronics owing to their excellent electrical and optical characteristics. However, active&#8208;matrix image sensors based on TMDs have limitations owing to the difficulty of fabricating large&#8208;area integrated circuitry and achieving high optical sensitivity. Herein, a large&#8208;area uniform, highly sensitive, and robust image sensor matrix with active pixels consisting of nanoporous molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) phototransistors and indium&#8211;gallium&#8211;zinc oxide (IGZO) switching transistors is reported. Large&#8208;area uniform 4&#8208;inch wafer&#8208;scale bilayer MoS2 films are synthesized by radio&#8208;frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering and sulfurization processes and patterned to be a nanoporous structure consisting of an array of periodic nanopores on the MoS2 surface via block copolymer lithography. Edge exposure on the nanoporous bilayer MoS2 induces the formation of subgap states, which promotes a photogating effect to obtain an exceptionally high photoresponsivity of 5.2 &#215; 104 A W&#8722;1. A 4&#8208;inch&#8208;wafer&#8208;scale image mapping is successively achieved using this active&#8208;matrix image sensor by controlling the device sensing and switching states. The high&#8208;performance active&#8208;matrix image sensor is state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in 2D material&#8208;based integrated circuitry and pixel image sensor applications.

         <title>Tailoring the d&#8208;Orbital Splitting Manner of Single Atomic Sites for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Fe d&#8208;orbital splitting manner modulation strategy is proposed to enhance the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance of atomically dispersed Fe&#63743;N4 sites. The axial tractions induce the transformation of local crystal field from primary square&#8208;planar field to the quasi&#8208;octahedral coordination. The rearrangement of electronic states leads to a favorable adsorption of ORR intermediates and excellent electrocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Regulating the electronic states of single atomic sites around the Fermi level remains a major concern for boosting the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, a Fe d&#8208;orbital splitting manner modulation strategy by constructing axial coordination on Fe&#63743;N4 sites is presented. Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations reveal that the axial tractions induce the distortion of square&#8208;planar field (Fe&#63743;N4 SP), up to the quasi&#8208;octahedral coordination (Fe&#63743;N4O1 OCquasi), thus leading to the electron rearrangement with a diluted spin polarization. The declined population of unpaired electrons in dz2, dxz and dyz states engenders a moderate adsorption of ORR intermediates, thereby reinforcing the intrinsic reaction activity. In situ infrared spectroscopy further demonstrates that the reordering of d&#8208;orbital splitting and occupation facilitates the desorption of *OH. The Fe&#63743;N4O1 OCquasi exhibits a dramatic improvement of kinetic current density and turnover frequency, which are fivefold and tenfold higher than those of Fe&#63743;N4 SP. This work presents a novel understanding on improving the electrocatalytic performance through the orbital&#8208;scale manipulation.

         <title>Higher&#8208;Order Topological States in Thermal Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental realization of higher&#8208;order thermal topological states in a generalized 2D diffusion lattice&#160;is&#160;reported. The topological edge and corner states for thermal diffusion are observed in the bandgap of diffusion rate spectrum that isolated from the bulk. Topological protection of these thermal domain&#8208;wall states is demonstrated with the stability of their diffusion profiles in the presence of amorphous deformation.








Abstract
Unlike conventional topological materials that carry topological states at their boundaries, higher&#8208;order topological materials are able to support topological states at boundaries of boundaries, such as corners and hinges. While band topology has been recently extended into thermal diffusion for thermal metamaterials, its realization is limited to a 1D thermal lattice, lacking access to the higher&#8208;order topology. In this work, the experimental realization is reported of a higher&#8208;order thermal topological insulator in a generalized 2D diffusion lattice. The topological corner states for thermal diffusion are observed in the bandgap of diffusion rate of the bulk, as a consequence of the anti&#8208;Hermitian nature of the diffusion Hamiltonian. The topological protection of these thermal corner states is demonstrated with the stability of their diffusion profile in the presence of amorphous deformation. This work constitutes the first realization of higher&#8208;order topology in purely diffusive systems and opens the door for future thermal management with topological protection beyond 1D geometries.

         <title>Unlock Restricted Capacity via O&#63743;Ce Hybridization for Li&#63743;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>

Different from the reported surface&#8208;mediated Li2O2 with limited film thickness of t&#160;&lt; 50&#160;nm, a submicron&#8208;thick Li2O2 shell with t&#160;&#8805; 400&#160;nm can be grown onto a high&#8208;energy faceted CeO2&#8208;&#948; catalyst, which induces an orbital hybridized electronic structure via electrochemical activations, unlocking the rechargeable capacities of Li&#8208;O2 batteries from restricted 1000 to unprecedented 10&#8201;000 mAh g&#8722;1.








Abstract
The aprotic Li&#8208;O2 battery (LOB) has the highest theoretical energy density of any rechargeable batteries. However, such system is largely restricted by the electrochemically formed lithium peroxide (Li2O2) on the cathode surface, leading ultimately to low actual capacities and early cell death. In contrast to the surface&#8208;mediated growth of thin film with a thickness &lt;50&#160;nm, a non&#8208;crystalline Li2O2 film with a thickness of &gt;400&#160;nm can be formed via an optimal O&#63743;Ce hybridized electronic structure. Specially, oxygen can react with dissolved cerium cations in the electrolyte via a cerium&#8208;oxygen reaction to form a high&#8208;energy faceted cerium oxide catalyst, which not only generates a great number of non&#8208;saturable active sites, but also erects electron transport bridges between the lattice O and adjacent Ce atoms. Such Ce&#63743;O orbital hybridization&#160;also forms a direct charge transfer channel from Ce&#63743;&#8208;4f of CeO2 to O22&#8722;${\rm{O}}_2^{2 - }$&#8208;&#960;* of Li2O2, eventually leading to submicron&#8208;thick Li2O2 shells via a subsequent lithium&#8208;oxygen reaction. Relying on the above merits, this work unlocks the rechargeable capacities of LOB from restricted 1000 to unprecedented 10&#160;000&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 with good cyclabilities and reduced charge&#8211;discharge overpotentials.

         <title>Density&#8208;of&#8208;States Matching&#8208;Induced Ultrahigh Current Density and High&#8208;Humidity Resistance in a Simply&#160;Structured Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is developed by using conductive materials as the triboelectric layers and electrodes simultaneously. Because of the matched density of states, the TENG reaches an ultrahigh current density of 1333 mA&#160;m&#8722;2. More importantly, this device can work stably in high&#8208;humidity environments, which is always a big challenge for traditional TENGs.








Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) can covert mechanical energy into electricity in a clean and sustainable manner. However, traditional TENGs are mainly limited by the low&#160;output current, and thus their practical applications are still limited. Herein, a new type of TENG is developed by using conductive materials as the triboelectric layers and electrodes simultaneously. Because of the matched density of states between the two triboelectric layers, this simply&#160;structured device reaches an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1400&#160;V and an ultrahigh current density of 1333&#160;mA m&#8722;2 when poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) film and copper (Cu) or aluminum (Al) foil are used as the triboelectric pair. The current density increases by nearly three orders of magnitude compared with traditional TENGs. More importantly, this device can work stably in high&#8208;humidity environments, which is always a big challenge for traditional TENGs. Surprisingly, this TENG can even perform well in the presence of water droplets. This work provides a new and effective strategy for constructing high&#8208;performance TENGs, which can be used in many practical applications in the near future.

         <title>Breaking the Photostability and pH Limitation of Halo&#8208;Fluoresceins through Chitosan Conjugation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halo&#8208;fluoresceins are famous for various applications, such as photoredox synthesis, photodynamic therapy, and sensing and imaging, but suffer from notorious photo&#8208;instability and pH dependence, which limit their applications in long&#8208;term light exposure and acidic environments. Herein, a chitosan conjugation strategy is proposed for significantly increasing the anti&#8208;photobleaching activity and pH inertness of halo&#8208;fluoresceins, endowing these old dyes&#160;with&#160;new&#160;vitality.&#160;








Abstract
Halo&#8208;fluoresceins are widely used in cell and tissue staining, intracellular sensing, and photodynamic therapy, but their notorious photo&#8208;instability and pH dependence restrict their applications, especially in long&#8208;term visible light exposure and acidic environments. To overcome these limitations, here a strategy is proposed of conjugating chitosan with the carboxyl group of halo&#8208;fluorescein (CS&#8208;halofluorescein). The cross&#8208;linked polymer chains and the hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks of chitosan help shielding out 1O2 from direct attacking the encapsulated halo&#8208;fluoresceins, leading to a&#160;two orders of magnitude lower photobleaching rate. Meanwhile, the condensation of primary amines of chitosan with the carboxyl group on halo&#8208;fluorescein blocks the pH&#8208;dependent intramolecular spirocyclization, leading to pH&#8208;inert fluorescein derivatives. The greatly improved photostability and pH inertness of CS&#8208;halofluoresceins can be harvested for aerobic photoredox synthesis and photodynamic bacteria inactivation in extremely acidic media. Moreover, food additive nature of chitosan and erythrosine (TIF) and excellent film&#8208;forming property of chitosan allow coating&#8208;based light&#8208;assisted preservation of perishable fruits, leading to appreciably extended shelf life of fruits (e.g., perishable strawberry, rt: &gt; 3 days; 4&#160;&#176;C: &gt; 5 days).

         <title>Phosphate&#8208;Rich Interface for a Highly Stable and Safe 4.6&#160;V LiCoO2 Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ generation of phosphate&#8208;rich cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface is proposed by reasonable design of the&#160;electrolyte, which can stabilize the LiCoO2&#160;(LCO) by decreasing the generation of cracks and suppressing the degradation of interface. Besides, it improves the flame&#8208;retardancy of electrolyte and guarantees the safety issues of high&#8208;voltage LCO.








Abstract
Increasing the upper cut&#8208;off voltage of LiCoO2 (LCO) is one of the most efficient strategies to gain high&#8208;energy density for current lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, surface instability is expected to be exaggerated with increasing voltage arising from the high reactivity between the delithiated LCO and electrolytes, leading to serious safety concerns. This work is aimed to construct a physically and chemically stable phosphate&#8208;rich cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface (CEI) on the LCO particles to mitigate this issue. This phosphate&#8208;rich CEI is generated during the electrochemical activation by using fluoroethylene carbonate and 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyletherare as the solvents. Both solvents also demonstrate high thermal stability, reducing the intrinsic flammability of the commercial organic electrolyte, thereby eliminating the safety concern in the LCO&#8208;based systems upon high&#8208;voltage operation. This stable CEI layer on the particle surface can also enhance the surface structure by blocking direct contact between LCO and electrolyte, improving the cycling stability. Therefore, by using the proposed electrolyte, the LCO cathode exhibits a high&#8208;capacity retention of 76.1% after 200 cycles at a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6&#160;V. This work provides a novel insight into the rational design of high&#8208;voltage and safe battery systems by adopting the flame&#8208;retardant electrolyte.

         <title>Sunlight Stimulated Photochemical Self&#8208;Healing Polymers Capable of Re&#8208;Bonding Damages up to a Centimeter Below the Surface Even Out of the Reach of the Illumination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sunlight&#8208;induced self&#8208;healing polymers capable of remending cracks up to a centimeter deep based on long&#8208;range free radicals transfer mechanism are developed by the incorporation of photo&#8208;sensitive dithiocarbamate units. Furthermore, record&#8208;high mechanical properties are acquired as compared with the reported photo&#8208;reversible polymers.









The development of photochemical self&#8208;healing polymers faces the the following bottlenecks: i) only the surface cracks can be restored and ii) materials&#8217; mechanical properties are lower. To break these bottlenecks, cross&#8208;linked poly(urethane&#8208;dithiocarbamate)s carrying photo&#8208;reversible dithiocarbamate bonds covalently linked to indole chromophores and benzyl groups are designed. The conjugated structure of the chromophore and benzyl enhances the addition reactivity of thiocarbonyl moiety and facilitates photo&#8208;cleavage of C&#63743;S bond, so that transfer of the created radicals among dithiocarbamate linkages is promoted. Accordingly, reshuffling of the reversibly cross&#8208;linked networks via dynamic exchange between the activated dithiocarbamates is enabled in both surface layer and the interior upon exposure to the low&#8208;intensity ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun. It is found that the damages up to a centimeter below the surface can be effectively recovered in the sunshine, which greatly exceeds the maximum penetration distance of UV light (hundreds of microns). Besides, tensile strength and failure strain of the poly(urethane&#8208;dithiocarbamate) are superior to the reported photo&#8208;reversible polymers, achieving the record&#8208;high 33.8 MPa and 782.0% owing to the wide selectivity of soft/hard blocks, multiple interactions, and appropriate cross&#8208;linking architecture. The present work provides a novel paradigm of photo self&#8208;healing polymers capable of re&#8208;bonding cracks even out of the reach of the illumination.

         <title>FeNC Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalyst with High Utilization Penta&#8208;Coordinated Sites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon oxygen reduction electrocatalyst with penta&#8208;coordinated sites and high electrochemical active sites utilization is prepared by low&#8208;temperature Fe coordination in a porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon synthetized through the ionothermal pyrolysis of 2,4,6&#8208;triaminopyrimidine. The structure of the active site is studied by means of X&#8208;ray absorption and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and the effect of axial ligands through density functional theory calculations.








Abstract
Atomic Fe in N&#8208;doped carbon (FeNC) electrocatalysts for oxygen (O2) reduction at the cathode of proton exchange membrane fuel cells are the most promising alternative to platinum&#8208;group&#8208;metal catalysts. Despite recent progress on atomic FeNC O2&#160;reduction, their controlled synthesis and stability for practical applications remain challenging. A two&#8208;step synthesis approach has recently led to significant advances in terms of Fe&#8208;loading and mass activity; however, the Fe utilization remains low owing to the difficulty of building scaffolds with sufficient porosity that electrochemically exposes the active sites. Herein, this issue is addressed by coordinating Fe in a highly porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support (&#8776;3295&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1), prepared by pyrolysis of inexpensive 2,4,6&#8208;triaminopyrimidine and a Mg2+ salt active site template and porogen. Upon Fe coordination, a high electrochemical active site density of 2.54&#160;&#215;&#160;1019&#160;sites&#160;gFeNC&#8722;1&#160;and a record 52% FeNx electrochemical utilization based on in situ nitrite stripping are achieved. The Fe single atoms are characterized pre&#8208; and post&#8208;electrochemical accelerated stress testing by aberration&#8208;corrected high&#8208;angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy, showing no Fe clustering. Moreover, ex situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and low&#8208;temperature M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy suggest the presence of penta&#8208;coordinated Fe sites, which are further studied by density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Multifunctional Nanogenerator&#8208;Integrated Metamaterial Concrete Systems for Smart Civil Infrastructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of lightweight composite metamaterial concrete with unprecedented mechanical properties and energy harvesting and sensing functionalities is presented. The metamaterial concrete systems are composed of auxetic lattices embedded inside a conductive cement matrix. They are tuned to achieve up to 15% compressibility. The power output of the nanogenerator&#8208;integrated metamaterial concrete prototypes reaches 330 &#181;W.








Abstract
Creating multifunctional concrete materials with advanced functionalities and mechanical tunability is a critical step toward reimagining the traditional civil infrastructure systems. Here, the concept of nanogenerator&#8208;integrated mechanical metamaterial concrete is presented to design lightweight and mechanically tunable concrete systems with energy harvesting and sensing functionalities. The proposed metamaterial concrete systems are created via integrating the mechanical metamaterial and nano&#8208;energy&#8208;harvesting paradigms. These advanced materials are composed of reinforcement auxetic polymer lattices with snap&#8208;through buckling behavior fully embedded inside a conductive cement matrix.&#160;We&#160;rationally design their composite structures to induce contact&#8208;electrification between the layers under mechanical excitations/triggering. The conductive cement enhanced with graphite powder serves as the electrode in the proposed systems, while providing the desired mechanical performance. Experimental studies are conducted to investigate the mechanical and electrical properties of the designed prototypes. The metamaterial concrete systems are tuned to achieve up to 15% compressibility under cycling loading. The power output of the nanogenerator&#8208;integrated metamaterial concrete prototypes reaches 330 &#181;W. Furthermore, the self&#8208;powered sensing functionality of the nanogenerator concrete systems for distributed health monitoring of large&#8208;scale concrete structures&#160;is&#160;demonstrated. The metamaterial concrete paradigm can possibly enable the&#160;design&#160;of smart civil infrastructure systems with a broad range of advanced functionalities.

         <title>Direct Visualization of Homogeneous Chemical Distribution in Functional Polyradical Microspheres</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using analytical electron microscopy techniques, it is demonstrated that the postfunctionalization of solid polymeric microstructures can&#8212;unexpectedly&#8212;lead to polyradical functionalization throughout the entirety of the material.








Abstract
It is demonstrated that the postfunctionalization of solid polymeric microspheres can generate fully and throughout functionalized materials, contrary to the expectation that core&#8211;shell structures are generated. The full functionalization is illustrated on the example of photochemically generated microspheres, which are subsequently transformed into polyradical systems. Given the all&#8208;organic nature of the functionalized microspheres, characterization methods with high analytical sensitivity and spatial resolution are pioneered by directly visualizing the inner chemical distribution of the postfunctionalized microspheres based on characteristic electron energy loss signals in transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Specifically, ultrasonic ultramicrotomy is combined successfully with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and electron spectroscopic&#160;imaging (ESI) during TEM. These findings open a key avenue for analyzing all&#8208;organic low&#8208;contrast soft&#8208;matter material structures, while the specifically investigated system concomitantly holds promise as an all&#8208;radical solid&#8208;state functional material.

Abstract
Conventional bulky and rigid planar architecting power systems are difficult to satisfy the growing demand for wearable applications. 1D fiber batteries bearing appealing features of miniaturization, adaptability, and weavability represent a promising solution, yet challenges remain pertaining to energy density and scalability. Herein, an ingenious densifiable functional ink is invented to fabricate scalable, flexible, and high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading fiber lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) by adopting a fast ink&#8208;extrusion technology. In the formulated ink, pyrrole&#8208;modified reduced graphene oxide is elaborately introduced and exerts multiple influences;&#160;it not only assembles carbon nanotubes and poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) to compose a sturdy, conductive, and agglomeration&#8208;free 3D network that realizes an ultra&#8208;high content (75&#160;wt%) of the active materials and endows the electrode excellent flexibility&#160;but&#160;also&#160;serves as a capillary densification inducer, encouraging an extremely large linear mass loading (1.01&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;1 per fiber) and packing density (782.1 mg&#160;cm&#8722;3). As a result, the assembled fiber LIBs deliver impressive linear and volumetric energy densities with superb mechanical compliance, demonstrating the best performance among all the reported extruded fiber batteries. This work highlights a highly effective and facile approach to fabricate high&#8208;performance fiber energy storage devices for future practical wearable applications.

         <title>Optimizing the Pd Sites in Pure Metallic Aerogels for Efficient Electrocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>

A novel catalyst design strategy is demonstrated for the optimization of Pd sites in pure metallic aerogels by tuning their geometric environments and electronic structures. By diminishing the Pd&#63743;Pd coordination, single&#8208;atom&#8208;like Pd motifs are constructed in the Pd2Hg5 aerogel, which are further fine&#8208;tuned to achieve an excellent electrocatalytic activity and selectivity for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production.








Decentralized electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an attractive alternative to the industrial anthraquinone process, the application of which is hindered by the lack of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts in acidic media. Herein, a novel catalyst design strategy is reported to optimize the Pd sites in pure metallic aerogels by tuning their geometric environments and electronic structures. By increasing the Hg content in the Pd&#8211;Hg aerogels, the Pd&#63743;Pd coordination is gradually diminished, resulting in isolated, single&#8208;atom&#8208;like Pd motifs in the Pd2Hg5 aerogel. Further heterometal doping leads to a series of M&#8211;Pd2Hg5 aerogels with an unalterable geometric environment, allowing for sole investigation&#160;of&#160;the electronic effects. Combining theoretical and experimental analyses, a volcano relationship is obtained for the M&#8211;Pd2Hg5 aerogels, demonstrating an effective tunability of the electronic structure of the Pd active sites. The optimized Au&#8211;Pd2Hg5 aerogel exhibits an outstanding H2O2 selectivity of 92.8% as well as transferred electron numbers of &#8776;2.1 in the potential range of 0.0&#8211;0.4 VRHE. This work opens a door for designing metallic aerogel electrocatalysts for H2O2 production and highlights the importance of electronic effects in tuning electrocatalytic performances.

         <title>Composite Hydrogel for Spatiotemporal Lipid Intervention of Tumor Milieu</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A&#160;composite hydrogel delivers three&#8208;in&#8208;one lipid peroxidation (LPO)&#8208;inducing nanoparticles (NPs) to tumor cells for amplified immune stimuli, and carries lipid rewiring agent to immunosuppressive cells for enhanced immune perception, thereby spatiotemporally regulating the tumor milieu for improved therapeutic outcomes.








Abstract
Induction of immunogenic cell death (ICD) plays crucial roles in cancer immunotherapy, whereas its efficacy is severely compromised by redundant antioxidant defenses in cancer cells and aberrant lipid metabolism in immunosuppressive cell populations. In&#160;this&#160;work, it is found that hollow mesoporous CuS nanoparticles (NPs) possess an intrinsic capacity of inhibiting glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). When loaded with an inhibitor of the ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1), these NPs block two parallel redox systems and cooperate with near&#8208;infrared irradiation to reinforce ICD. A hydrogel co&#8208;delivering cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;targeting CuS NPs and immunosuppressive&#8208;cell&#8208;targeting sulfo&#8208;N&#8208;succinimidyl oleate (SSO) for spatiotemporal lipid intervention i further fabricated. While the CuS NPs augment ICD via synergistic lipid peroxidation, SSO reinstates immune perception via lipid metabolic reprogramming, thereby coordinately triggering robust innate and adaptive immunity to restrain tumor growth, relapse, and metastasis. This study provides an immunometabolic therapy via orchestrated lipid modulation in the tumor milieu.

         <title>Precisely Controllable Artificial Muscle with Continuous Morphing based on &#8220;Breathing&#8221; of Supramolecular Columns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hemiphasmidic side&#8208;chain liquid&#160;crystal polymer forms multichain supramolecular columnar assemblies. Through the cooperative movements of main&#8208;chains and side&#8208;chains, the uniaxially aligned polymer strip executes muscle&#8208;like continuous and reversible elongation/contraction. The irreversible photoisomerization of mesogens further endows the polymer strip with arm&#8208;like phototunable bending which can lift heavy load. Both deformations are under precise control of temperature.








Abstract
Skeletal muscles are natural motors executing sophisticated work through precise control of linear contraction. Although various liquid crystal polymers&#160;based artificial muscles have&#160;been designed, the mechanism based on mainly the order&#8211;disorder transition usually leads to discrete shape morphing, leaving arbitrary and precise deformation a huge challenge. Here, one novel photoresponsive hemiphasmidic side&#8208;chain liquid crystal polymer with a unique &#8220;breathing&#8221; columnar phase that enables continuous morphing is presented. Due to confinement inside the supramolecular columnar assembly, the cooperative movements of side&#8208;chains and backbones generate a significant negative thermal expansion and lead to temperature&#8208;controllable muscle&#8208;like elongation/contraction in the oriented polymer strip. The irreversible isomerization of the photoresponsive mesogens results in the synergistic phototunable bending and high&#8208;contrast fluorescence change. Based on the orthogonal responses to heat and light, controllable arm&#8208;like bending motions of this material, which is applicable in constructing advanced artificial muscles or intelligent soft robotics, are further demonstrated.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;in&#8208;Gas System for Promoted Photocatalytic Ammonia Synthesis on Porous Framework Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional gas&#8208;in&#8208;solvent reaction systems for photocatalytic nitrogen reduction suffer from unsatisfactory activity, since the overwhelming protic solvent severely hinders the nitrogen transfer and causes strong competing hydrogen evolution. In this work, a novel &#8220;solvent&#8208;in&#8208;gas&#8221; system, which enables direct operation of photocatalyst under a nitrogen gas&#8208;dominated environment with limited proton source, is designed to fundamentally solve the above problem.








Abstract
Photocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (PNRR) is emerging as a sustainable ammonia synthesis approach to meet global carbon neutrality. Porous framework materials with well&#8208;designed structures have great opportunities in PNRR; however, they suffer from unsatisfactory activity in the conventional gas&#8208;in&#8208;solvent system (GIS), owing to the hindrance of nitrogen utilization and strong competing hydrogen evolution caused by overwhelming solvent. In this study, porous framework materials are combined with a novel &#8220;solvent&#8208;in&#8208;gas&#8221; system, which can bring their superiority into full play. This system enables photocatalysts to directly operate in a gas&#8208;dominated environment with a limited proton source uniformly suspended in it, achieving the accumulation of high&#8208;concentrated nitrogen within porous framework while efficiently restricting the solvent&#8208;photocatalyst contact. An over eightfold increase in ammonia production rate (1820.7 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) compared with the conventional GIS and an apparent quantum efficiency as high as &#8776;0.5% at 400 nm are achieved. This system&#8208;level strategy further finds applicability in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, featuring it as a staple for photosynthetic methodology.

         <title>Stabilizing Single&#8208;Atomic Pt by Forming Pt&#63743;Fe Bonds for Efficient Diboration of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;atom Pt catalyst with Fe&#8211;Pt&#8211;O structure is constructed to tune the oxidation state of Pt for high catalytic efficiency of the diboration of alkynes. Benefiting from the well&#8208;tuned structure, the catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic performance at high temperature. Strikingly, the reaction can be catalyzed at room temperature with a relatively high turnover frequency.








Abstract
Precisely tailoring the oxidation state of single&#8208;atomic metal in heterogeneous catalysis is an efficient way to stabilize the single&#8208;atomic site and promote their activity, but realizing this approach remains a grand challenge to date. Herein, a class of stable single&#8208;atomic catalysts with well&#8208;tuned oxidation state of Pt by forming Pt&#63743;Fe atomic bonds&#160;is&#160;reported, which are supported by defective Fe2O3&#160;nanosheets on reduced graphene oxide (PFARFNs). These as&#8208;synthesized materials can greatly enhance the catalytic activity, stability, and selectivity for the diboration of alkynes. The PFARFNs exhibit high conversion of 99% at 100&#160;&#176;C with an outstanding turnover frequency (TOF) of 545&#160;h&#8722;1, and a relatively high conversion of 58% at room temperature (25&#160;&#176;C) with a TOF of 310&#160;h&#8722;1, which has been&#160;hardly achieved previously. Through both experimental and theoretical investigation, it is demonstrated that the fast electron transfer from Fe to Pt in Fe&#8211;Pt&#8211;O atomic sites in PFARFNs can not only stabilize the single&#8208;atomic Pt, but also significantly improve their catalytic activity.

         <title>The Atomic Drill Bit: Precision Controlled Atomic Fabrication of 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through direct and automated control over the electron beam scan pathway profile in an aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscope, metallic 1D&#8211;2D edge heterostructures are fabricated with atomic precision in semiconducting MoS2. This atomic fabrication workflow paves the way for precision controlled atomic fabrication of functional nanomaterials.








Abstract
The ability to deterministically fabricate nanoscale architectures with atomic precision is the central goal of nanotechnology, whereby highly localized changes in the atomic structure can be exploited to control device properties at their fundamental physical limit. Here, an automated, feedback&#8208;controlled atomic fabrication method is reported and the formation of 1D&#8211;2D heterostructures in MoS2 is demonstrated through selective transformations along specific crystallographic orientations. The atomic&#8208;scale probe of an aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) is used, and the shape and symmetry of the scan pathway relative to the sample orientation are controlled. The focused and shaped electron beam is used to reliably create Mo6S6 nanowire (MoS&#8208;NW) terminated metallic&#8208;semiconductor 1D&#8211;2D edge structures within a pristine MoS2 monolayer with atomic precision. From these results, it is found that a triangular beam path aligned along the zig&#8208;zag sulfur terminated (ZZS)&#160;direction forms stable MoS&#8208;NW edge structures with the highest degree of fidelity without resulting in disordering of the surrounding MoS2 monolayer. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ab initio molecular dynamic simulations (AIMD) are used to calculate the energetic barriers for the most stable atomic edge structures and atomic transformation pathways. These discoveries provide an automated method to improve understanding of atomic&#8208;scale transformations while opening a pathway toward more precise atomic&#8208;scale engineering of materials.

Here, an automated, feedback-controlled atomic fabrication method is reported and the formation of 1D&#8211;2D heterostructures in MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is demonstrated through selective transformations along specific crystallographic orientations. The atomic-scale probe of an aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) is used, and the shape and symmetry of the scan pathway relative to the sample orientation are controlled. The focused and shaped electron beam is used to reliably create Mo&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; nanowire (MoS-NW) terminated metallic-semiconductor 1D&#8211;2D edge structures within a pristine MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; monolayer with atomic precision. From these results, it is found that a triangular beam path aligned along the zig-zag sulfur terminated (ZZS)&#160;direction forms stable MoS-NW edge structures with the highest degree of fidelity without resulting in disordering of the surrounding MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; monolayer. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ab initio molecular dynamic simulations (AIMD) are used to calculate the energetic barriers for the most stable atomic edge structures and atomic transformation pathways. These discoveries provide an automated method to improve understanding of atomic-scale transformations while opening a pathway toward more precise atomic-scale engineering of materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High Durability of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with Carbon Vacancies toward the&#160;Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vacancy&#8208;modulated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C single&#8208;atom catalysts are successfully prepared through microenvironment modulation and applied as highly durable catalysts for oxygen reduction reactions and zinc&#8211;air batteries. The vacancies around metal&#8211;N4 sites can reduce the adsorption free energy of OH*, and hinder the dissolution of metal center, significantly enhancing the reaction kinetics and stability.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted extensive interest to catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells and metal&#8211;air batteries. However, the development of SACs with high selectivity and long&#8208;term stability is a great challenge. In this work, carbon vacancy modified Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C SACs (FeH&#8211;N&#8211;C) are practically designed and synthesized through microenvironment modulation, achieving high&#8208;efficient utilization of active sites and optimization of electronic structures. The FeH&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst exhibits a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.91&#160;V and sufficient durability of 100&#8201;000 voltage cycles with 29&#160;mV E1/2 loss. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the vacancies around metal&#8211;N4 sites can reduce the adsorption free energy of OH*, and hinder the dissolution of metal center, significantly enhancing the ORR kinetics and stability. Accordingly, FeH&#8211;N&#8211;C SACs presented a high&#8208;power density and long&#8208;term stability over 1200&#160;h in rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs). This work will not only guide for developing highly active and stable SACs through rational modulation of metal&#8211;N4 sites, but also provide an insight into the optimization of the electronic structure to boost electrocatalytical performances.

Melt Electrowriting
In article number 2209244, Carlos S&#225;nchez&#8208;Somolinos and co&#8208;workers report on the melt electrowriting of liquid crystal elastomers to digitally position ultrafine fibers with controlled morphology. The presented methodology enables the preparation of well&#8208;defined, high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio scaffolds with small dimensions hardly accessible with conventional extrusion&#8208;based printing techniques. This printing platform enables the preparation of stimuli&#8208;responsive miniaturized structures for biomedical and soft robotic applications.

Acoustic Metasurfaces
In article number 2208002, Mingxin Xu, Peter V. S. Lee, David J. Collins, and co&#8208;workers present an approach to ultrathin acoustic metasurfaces, using planarized micropillars in a discretized phase array, which can be easily produced by a single&#8208;step etching process. The flexibility of this approach is demonstrated in the production of complex acoustic patterns using acoustic holography.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Hybridized Hydroxides for Energy Conversion and Storage: Interface Chemistry and Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbon&#8208;hybridized hydroxides (CHHs) have unique superiorities in energy storage/conversion, in which the intrinsic roles of carbon at the heterogeneous interface are highlighted. The methods to construct a robust heterointerface in CHHs are summarized. The techniques to pinpoint the interface interaction and rehybridization electron configuration between carbon and hydroxides, and the future directions and perspective of the CHHs are outlined.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;hybridized hydroxides (CHHs) have been intensively investigated for uses in the energy conversion/storage fields. Nevertheless, the intrinsic structure&#8211;activity relationships between carbon and hydroxides within CHHs are still blurry, which hinders the fine modulation of CHHs in terms of practical applications to some degree. This review aims to figure out the intrinsic role of carbon materials in CHHs with a focus on the interface chemistry and the engineering strategy in&#8208;between two components. The fundamental effects of the carbon materials in enhancing the charge/mass transfer kinetics are first analyzed, particularly the extra electron pathways for fast charge transfer and the anchoring sites for boosting the mass transfer. Subsequently, the surface&#8208;guided/confined effects of carbon materials in CHHs to modify the morphology and tailor the hydroxides, and functional heterojunction for regulating the inner electronic structure are decoupled. The methods to efficiently construct a stable yet robust solid&#8211;solid heterointerface are summarized, including oxygen functional groups engrafting, topological defective sites construction and heteroatom incorporation to activate the inert carbon surface. The smart CHHs in some typical energy applications are demonstrated. Additionally, the methodologies that can reveal the hybridization electron configuration between two components are summed up. At last, the perspective and challenges faced by the CHHs for energy&#8208;related applications are outlined.

         <title>Recent Advances in Efficient Photocatalysis via Modulation of Electric and Magnetic Fields and Reactive Phase Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electric and magnetic fields&#8217; modulation and reactive phase control strategies exhibit robust manipulation role in promoting the separation and transfer of photoexcited carriers, lowering photocatalytic reaction energy barrier, and facilitating mass transfer, which have received much attention and become the research hotspot in photocatalytic field for achieving efficient photocatalytic performance.








Abstract
The past several years has witnessed significant progress in enhancing photocatalytic performance via robust electric and magnetic fields&#8217; modulation to promote the separation and transfer of photoexcited carriers, and phase control at reactive interface to lower photocatalytic reaction energy barrier and facilitate mass transfer. These three research directions have received soaring attention in photocatalytic field.

&lt;p&gt;Electric and magnetic fields&#8217; modulation and reactive phase control strategies exhibit robust manipulation role in promoting the separation and transfer of photoexcited carriers, lowering photocatalytic reaction energy barrier, and facilitating mass transfer, which have received much attention and become the research hotspot in photocatalytic field for achieving efficient photocatalytic performance.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past several years has witnessed significant progress in enhancing photocatalytic performance via robust electric and magnetic fields&#8217; modulation to promote the separation and transfer of photoexcited carriers, and phase control at reactive interface to lower photocatalytic reaction energy barrier and facilitate mass transfer. These three research directions have received soaring attention in photocatalytic field. Herein, recent advances in photocatalysis modulated by electric field (i.e., piezoelectric, pyroelectric, and triboelectric fields, as well as their coupling) with specific examples and mechanisms discussion are first examined. Subsequently, the strategy via magnetic field manipulation for enhancing photocatalytic performance is scrutinized, including the spin polarization, Lorentz force, and magnetoresistance effect. Afterward, materials with tailored structure and composition design enabled by reactive phase control and their applications in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and carbon dioxide reduction are reviewed. Finally, the challenges and potential opportunities to further boost photocatalytic efficiency are presented, aiming at providing crucial theoretical and experimental guidance for those working in photocatalysis, ferroelectrics, triboelectrics, piezo-/pyro-/tribo-phototronics, and electromagnetics, among other related areas.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Based Flexible Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 14, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latest methods of synthesizing advanced functional hydrogels and the state&#8208;of&#8208;art applications of hydrogel&#8208;based flexible electronics in various fields are reviewed. More importantly, the correlation between properties of the hydrogel and device performance, to have better understanding of the development of flexible electronics by using environmentally responsive hydrogels are discussed. Last, perspectives on the current challenges and future directions in the development of hydrogel&#8208;based multifunctional flexible electronics are provided.








Abstract
Flexible electronics is an emerging field of research involving multiple disciplines, which include but not limited to physics, chemistry, materials science, electronic engineering, and biology. However, the broad applications of flexible electronics are still restricted due to several limitations, including high Young's modulus, poor biocompatibility, and poor responsiveness. Innovative materials aiming for overcoming these drawbacks and boost its practical application is highly desirable. Hydrogel is a class of 3D crosslinked hydrated polymer networks, and its exceptional material properties render it as a promising candidate for the next generation of flexible electronics. Here, the latest methods of synthesizing advanced functional hydrogels and the state&#8208;of&#8208;art applications of hydrogel&#8208;based flexible electronics in various fields are reviewed. More importantly, the correlation between properties of the hydrogel and device performance is discussed here, to have better understanding of the development of flexible electronics by using environmentally responsive hydrogels.

         <title>Stabilization of FAPbI3 with multifunctional alkali&#8208;functionalized polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The defects located at the interfaces and grain boundaries (GBs) of perovskite films are detrimental to the photovoltaic performance and stability of perovskite solar cells. Manipulating the perovskite crystallization process and tailoring the interfaces with molecular passivators are mainly effective strategies to mitigate performance loss and instability. Herein we report a new strategy to manipulate the crystallization process of FAPbI3&#8208;rich perovskite by incorporating a small amount of alkali functionalized polymers into the antisolvent solution. The synergic effects of alkali cations and polyacrylic acid anion effectively passivate the defects on the surface and GBs of perovskite films. As a result, the rubidium (Rb)&#8208;functionalized polyacrylic acid significantly improves the power conversion efficiency of FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells to approaching 25% and reduces the risk of lead ion (Pb2+) leakage via the strong interaction between C = O bond and Pb2+. In addition, the unencapsulated device shows enhanced operational stability, retaining 80% of its initial efficiency after 500&#160;h operation at maximum power point under one&#8208;sun illumination.

         <title>Multifunctional Coatings on Sulfide&#8208;Based Solid Electrolyte Powders with Enhanced Processability, Stability, and Performance for Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By leveraging the versatility of atomic layer deposition, multifunctional coatings are grown on sulfide&#8208;based argyrodite solid&#8208;state electrolytes that improve their (electro)chemical stability and performance for lithium metal batteries. This work highlights a completely new framework for designing active and stable materials for next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
Sulfide&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) exhibit many tantalizing properties including high ionic conductivity and favorable mechanical properties for next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state batteries. Widespread adoption of these materials is hindered by their intrinsic instability under ambient conditions, which makes them difficult to process at scale, and instability at the Li||SSE and cathode||SSE interfaces, which limits cell performance and lifetime. Atomic layer deposition is leveraged to grow thin Al2O3 coatings on Li6PS5Cl powders to address both issues simultaneously. These coatings can be directly grown onto Li6PS5Cl particles with negligible chemical modification of the underlying material and enable exposure of powders to pure and H2O&#8208;saturated oxygen environments for &#8805;4 h with minimal reactivity, compared with significant degradation of the uncoated powder. Pellets fabricated from coated powders exhibit ionic conductivities up to 2&#215; higher than those made from uncoated material, with a simultaneous decrease in electronic conductivity and significant suppression of chemical reactivity at the Li&#8208;SSE interface. These benefits result in significantly improved room temperature cycle life at high capacity and current density. It is hypothesized that this enhanced performance derives from improved intergranular properties and improved Li metal adhesion. This work points to a completely new framework for designing active, stable, and scalable materials for next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Approaches to Improving the Selectivity of Nanozymes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanozymes must be selective if they are to replace enzymes in sensing or catalysis. Mimicking enzymatic active sites and nanoconfined substrate channels provides an avenue to improving the selectivity of nanozymes. However, a purely biomimetic approach to nanozyme design limits the design of enzyme mimics. Therefore, designers endeavor to utilize all synthetic methods to make more selective nanozymes.








Abstract
Nanozymes mimic enzymes and that includes their selectivity. To achieve selectivity, significant inspiration for nanoparticle design can come from the geometric and molecular features that make enzymes selective catalysts. The two central features enzymes use are control over the arrangement of atoms in the active site and the placing of the active site down a nanoconfined substrate channel. The implementation of enzyme&#8208;inspired features has already been shown to both improve activity and selectivity of nanoparticles for a variety of catalytic and sensing applications. The tuning and control of active sites on metal nanoparticle surfaces ranges from simply changing the composition of the surface metal to sophisticated approaches such as the immobilization of single atoms on a metal substrate. Molecular frameworks provide a powerful platform for the implementation of isolated and discrete active sites while unique diffusional environments further improve selectivity. The implementation of nanoconfined substrate channels around these highly controlled active sites offers further ability to control selectivity through altering the solution environment and transport of reactants and products. Implementing these strategies together offers a unique opportunity to improve nanozyme selectivity in both sensing and catalysis.

         <title>Distinct Contact Scaling Effects in MoS2 Transistors Revealed with Asymmetrical Contact Measurements</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetrical contact measurements (ACMs) are demonstrated to explore scaling effects in Ni&#8211;MoS2&#160;contacts. ACMs compare electron injection at different contact lengths on the same MoS2&#160;channel to eliminate channel&#8208;to&#8208;channel variations. Importantly, source contacts yield more degradation in transistor current when scaled than drain contacts. ACMs provide a framework for generating new understanding of 2D&#8208;metal interfaces.








Abstract
2D semiconducting materials have immense potential for future electronics due to their atomically thin nature, which&#160;enables better scalability. While the channel scalability of 2D materials has been extensively studied, the current understanding of contact scaling in 2D devices is inconsistent and&#160;oversimplified. Here physically scaled contacts and asymmetrical contact measurements (ACMs) are combined to investigate the contact scaling behavior in 2D field&#8208;effect transistors. The ACMs directly compare electron injection at different contact lengths while using the exact same MoS2&#160;channel, eliminating channel&#8208;to&#8208;channel variations.&#160;The&#160;results show that scaled source contacts can limit the drain current, whereas scaled drain contacts do not. Compared to devices with long contact lengths, devices with short contact lengths (scaled contacts) exhibit larger variations, 15% lower drain currents at high drain&#8211;source voltages, and a higher chance of&#160;early saturation and negative differential resistance. Quantum transport simulations reveal that the transfer length of Ni&#8211;MoS2&#160;contacts can be as short as 5&#160;nm. Furthermore,&#160;it is&#160;clearly identified that the actual transfer length depends on the quality of the metal&#8208;2D interface. The ACMs demonstrated here will enable further understanding of contact scaling behavior at various interfaces.

     alt="Distinct Contact Scaling Effects in MoS2 Transistors Revealed with Asymmetrical Contact Measurements"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asymmetrical contact measurements (ACMs) are demonstrated to explore scaling effects in Ni&#8211;MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;contacts. ACMs compare electron injection at different contact lengths on the same MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;channel to eliminate channel-to-channel variations. Importantly, source contacts yield more degradation in transistor current when scaled than drain contacts. ACMs provide a framework for generating new understanding of 2D-metal interfaces.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D semiconducting materials have immense potential for future electronics due to their atomically thin nature, which&#160;enables better scalability. While the channel scalability of 2D materials has been extensively studied, the current understanding of contact scaling in 2D devices is inconsistent and&#160;oversimplified. Here physically scaled contacts and asymmetrical contact measurements (ACMs) are combined to investigate the contact scaling behavior in 2D field-effect transistors. The ACMs directly compare electron injection at different contact lengths while using the exact same MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;channel, eliminating channel-to-channel variations.&#160;The&#160;results show that scaled source contacts can limit the drain current, whereas scaled drain contacts do not. Compared to devices with long contact lengths, devices with short contact lengths (scaled contacts) exhibit larger variations, 15% lower drain currents at high drain&#8211;source voltages, and a higher chance of&#160;early saturation and negative differential resistance. Quantum transport simulations reveal that the transfer length of Ni&#8211;MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;contacts can be as short as 5&#160;nm. Furthermore,&#160;it is&#160;clearly identified that the actual transfer length depends on the quality of the metal-2D interface. The ACMs demonstrated here will enable further understanding of contact scaling behavior at various interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Advances in 4D Printing of Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) exhibit attractive stimuli&#8208;responsive properties, showing great application potential in soft robotics, biomedicine, optics, etc. The advent of 4D printing opens a new door for the design and fabrication of LCEs with programmable stimuli&#8208;responsive properties and 3D geometries. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances in 4D printing of LCEs are reviewed, with emphasis on both mechanisms and potential applications.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are renowned for their large, reversible, and anisotropic shape change in response to various external stimuli due to their lightly cross&#8208;linked polymer networks with an oriented mesogen direction, thus showing great potential for applications in robotics, bio&#8208;medics, electronics, optics, and energy. To fully take advantage of the anisotropic stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviors of LCEs, it is preferable to achieve a locally controlled mesogen alignment into monodomain orientations. In recent years, the application of 4D printing to LCEs opens new doors for simultaneously programming the mesogen alignment and the 3D geometry, offering more opportunities and higher feasibility for the fabrication of 4D&#8208;printed LCE objects with desirable stimuli&#8208;responsive properties. Here, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances in 4D printing of LCEs are reviewed, with emphasis on both the mechanisms and potential applications. First, the fundamental properties of LCEs and the working principles of the representative 4D printing techniques are briefly introduced. Then, the fabrication of LCEs by 4D printing techniques and the advantages over conventional manufacturing methods are demonstrated. Finally, perspectives on the current challenges and potential development trends toward the 4D printing of LCEs are discussed, which may shed light on future research directions in this new field.

         <title>Graphene Spin Valves&#160;for Spin Logic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of spin logic devices and spin&#8208;FETs in graphene marks an important step for the future development of spin&#8208;based computing technology. Their low on/off switching energy, low Joule heating losses, and scalability are attractive features from a device perspective. The non&#8208;volatile nature of graphene spin logic devices can be exploited for logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory applications for neuromorphic computing architectures.








Abstract
An alternative to charge&#8208;based electronics identifies the spin degree of freedom for information communication and processing. The long spin&#8208;diffusion length in graphene at room temperature demonstrates its ability for highly scalable spintronics. The development of the graphene spin valve (SV) has inspired spin devices in graphene including spin field&#8208;effect transistors and spin majority logic gates. A comprehensive picture of spin transport in graphene SVs is required for further development of spin logic. This review examines the advances in graphene SVs and their role in the development of spin logic devices. Different transport and scattering mechanisms in charge and spin are discussed. Furthermore, the on/off switching energy between graphene SVs and charge&#8208;based FETs is compared to highlight their prospects for low&#8208;power devices. The challenges and perspectives that need to be addressed for the future development of spin logic devices are then outlined.

         <title>Biosystem&#8208;Inspired Engineering of Nanozymes for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent advances in the engineering of biosystem&#8208;inspired nanozymes, by leveraging the refined catalytic structure of natural enzymes, simulating the behavior changes of natural enzymes in the catalytic process, mimicking the specific biological processes or living organisms, as well as their biomedical applications, are reviewed.








Abstract
Nanozymes with intrinsic enzyme&#8208;mimicking activities have shown great potential to become surrogates of natural enzymes in many fields by virtue of their advantages of high catalytic stability, ease of functionalization, and low cost. However, due to the lack of predictable descriptors, most of the nanozymes reported in the past have been obtained mainly through trial&#8208;and&#8208;error strategies, and the catalytic efficacy, substrate specificity, as well as practical application effect under physiological conditions, are far inferior to that of natural enzymes. To optimize the catalytic efficacies and functions of nanozymes in biomedical settings, recent studies have introduced biosystem&#8208;inspired strategies into nanozyme design. In this review, recent advances in the engineering of biosystem&#8208;inspired nanozymes by leveraging the refined catalytic structure of natural enzymes, simulating the behavior changes of natural enzymes in the catalytic process, and mimicking the specific biological processes or living organisms, are introduced. Furthermore, the currently involved biomedical applications of biosystem&#8208;inspired nanozymes are summarized. More importantly, the current opportunities and challenges of the design and application of biosystem&#8208;inspired nanozymes are discussed. It is hoped that the studies of nanozymes based on bioinspired strategies will be beneficial for constructing the new generation of nanozymes and broadening their biomedical applications.

         <title>Convective Thermal Metamaterials: Exploring High&#8208;Efficiency, Directional, and Wave&#8208;Like Heat Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Providing a new knob for controlling heat transfer, convective effects have gained significant interest in the design of thermal metamaterials. With the introduced efficient, directional, and wave&#8208;like heat transfer, many novel phenomena are observed in dissipative regime. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advancements in this emerging field are brought under the same umbrella, and a future perspective on promising directions is provided.








Abstract
Convective thermal metamaterials are artificial structures where convection dominates in the thermal process. Due to the field coupling between velocity and temperature, convection provides a new knob for controlling heat transfer beyond pure conduction, thus allowing active and robust thermal modulations. With the introduced convective effects, the original parabolic Fourier heat equation for pure conduction can be transformed to hyperbolic. Therefore, the hybrid diffusive system can be interpreted in a wave&#8208;like fashion, reviving many wave phenomena in dissipative diffusion. Here, recent advancements in convective thermal metamaterials are reviewed and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art discoveries are classified into the following four aspects, enhancing heat transfer, porous&#8208;media&#8208;based thermal effects, nonreciprocal heat transfer, and non&#8208;Hermitian phenomena. Finally, a prospect is cast on convective thermal metamaterials from two aspects. One is to utilize the convective parameter space to explore topological thermal effects. The other is to further broaden the convective parameter space with spatiotemporal modulation and multi&#8208;physical effects.

         <title>Intrinsic Optical Properties and Emerging Applications of Gold Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances in nanoscience and technology have been promoted to reveal the physical origin of the intrinsic optical properties of gold nanostructures with consideration of size, shape, phase, composition, hybridization, assembly, and nanopatterning. The perspectives on the future developments, challenges, and opportunities of gold nanostructures are discussed to provide insights for improving their optical properties and performance in various applications.








Abstract
The collective oscillation of free electrons at the nanoscale surface of gold nanostructures is closely modulated by tuning the size, shape/morphology, phase, composition, hybridization, assembly, and nanopatterning, along with the surroundings of the plasmonic surface located at a dielectric interface with air, liquid, and solid. This review first introduces the physical origin of the intrinsic optical properties of gold nanostructures and further summarizes stimuli&#8208;responsive changes in optical properties, metal&#8208;field&#8208;enhanced optical signals, luminescence spectral shaping, chiroptical response, and photogenerated hot carriers. The current success in the landscape of nanoscience and nanotechnology mainly originates from the abundant optical properties of gold nanostructures in the thermodynamically stable face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) phase. It has been further extended by crystal phase engineering to prepare thermodynamically unfavorable phases (e.g., kinetically stable) and heterophases to modulate their intriguing phase&#8208;dependent optical properties. A broad range of promising applications, including but not limited to full&#8208;color displays, solar energy harvesting, photochemical reactions, optical sensing, and microscopic/biomedical imaging, have fostered parallel research on the multitude of physical effects occurring in gold nanostructures.

The current success in the landscape of nanoscience and nanotechnology mainly originates from the abundant optical properties of gold nanostructures in the thermodynamically stable face-centered cubic (fcc) phase. It has been further extended by crystal phase engineering to prepare thermodynamically unfavorable phases (e.g., kinetically stable) and heterophases to modulate their intriguing phase-dependent optical properties. A broad range of promising applications, including but not limited to full-color displays, solar energy harvesting, photochemical reactions, optical sensing, and microscopic/biomedical imaging, have fostered parallel research on the multitude of physical effects occurring in gold nanostructures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Electronics: Creating and Bridging Molecular Junctions and Promoting Its Commercialization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive investigation of nanogap electrode fabrication protocols according to new classification principles is provided. How to integrate molecules into nanogap electrodes to form molecular junctions and highlight recent efforts toward the commercialization of molecular circuits are summarized, eventually overcoming the Achilles&#8217; heel of molecular electronics as a whole.








Abstract
Molecular electronics is driven by the dream of expanding Moore's law to the molecular level for next&#8208;generation electronics through incorporating individual or ensemble molecules into electronic circuits. For nearly 50 years, numerous efforts have been made to explore the intrinsic properties of molecules and develop diverse fascinating molecular electronic devices with the desired functionalities. The flourishing of molecular electronics is inseparable from the development of various elegant methodologies for creating nanogap electrodes and bridging the nanogap with molecules. This review first focuses on the techniques for making lateral and vertical nanogap electrodes by breaking, narrowing, and fixed modes, and highlights their capabilities, applications, merits, and shortcomings. After summarizing the approaches of growing single molecules or molecular layers on the electrodes, the methods of constructing a complete molecular circuit are comprehensively grouped into three categories: 1) directly bridging one&#8208;molecule&#8211;electrode component with another electrode, 2) physically bridging two&#8208;molecule&#8211;electrode components, and 3) chemically bridging two&#8208;molecule&#8211;electrode components. Finally, the current state of molecular circuit integration and commercialization is discussed and perspectives are provided, hoping to encourage the community to accelerate the realization of fully scalable molecular electronics for a new era of integrated microsystems and applications.

         <title>Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficiency of proton exchange membrane based electrolyzers is highly dependent on the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the anode. The recent progress on the design of acidic OER electrocatalysts is reviewed, along with theoretical and experimental studies on the intrinsic mechanisms. Furthermore, some unresolved but urgent questions and the perspectives regarding future research for acidic OER electrocatalysts are provided.








Abstract
The well&#8208;established proton exchange membrane (PEM)&#8208;based water electrolysis, which operates under acidic conditions, possesses many advantages compared to alkaline water electrolysis, such as compact design, higher voltage efficiency, and higher gas purity. However, PEM&#8208;based water electrolysis is hampered by the low efficiency, instability, and high cost of anodic electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this review, the recently reported acidic OER electrocatalysts are comprehensively summarized, classified, and discussed. The related fundamental studies on OER mechanisms and the relationship between activity and stability are particularly highlighted in order to provide an atomistic&#8208;level understanding for OER catalysis. A stability test protocol is suggested to evaluate the intrinsic activity degradation. Some current challenges and unresolved questions, such as the usage of carbon&#8208;based materials and the differences between the electrocatalyst performances in acidic electrolytes and PEM&#8208;based electrolyzers are also discussed. Finally, suggestions for the most promising electrocatalysts and a perspective for future research are outlined. This review presents a fresh impetus and guideline to the rational design and synthesis of high&#8208;performance acidic OER electrocatalysts for PEM&#8208;based water electrolysis.

         <title>Molecular Complementarity of Proteomimetic Materials for Target&#8208;Specific Recognition and Recognition&#8208;Mediated Complex Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In nature, proteins perform various recognition&#8208;mediated molecular functions relying on the principle of molecular complementarity. This review introduces how diverse synthesizable and modifiable materials with elaborate structural and molecular designs can achieve the molecular complementarity in mediating complex protein&#8208;like functions, such as allosteric regulation, signal transduction, enzymatic reactions, and stimuli&#8208;responsive motions, expanding the landscape of their proteomimetic applications.








Abstract
As biomolecules essential for sustaining life, proteins are generated from long chains of 20 different &#945;&#8208;amino acids that are folded into unique 3D structures. In particular, many proteins have molecular recognition functions owing to their binding pockets, which have complementary shapes, charges, and polarities for specific targets, making these biopolymers unique and highly valuable for biomedical and biocatalytic applications. Based on the understanding of protein structures and microenvironments, molecular complementarity can be exhibited by synthesizable and modifiable materials. This has prompted researchers to explore the proteomimetic potentials of a diverse range of materials, including biologically available peptides and oligonucleotides, synthetic supramolecules, inorganic molecules, and related coordination networks. To fully resemble a protein, proteomimetic materials perform the molecular recognition to mediate complex molecular functions, such as allosteric regulation, signal transduction, enzymatic reactions, and stimuli&#8208;responsive motions; this can also expand the landscape of their potential bio&#8208;applications. This review focuses on the recognitive aspects of proteomimetic designs derived for individual materials and their conformations. Recent progress provides insights to help guide the development of advanced protein mimicry with material heterogeneity, design modularity, and tailored functionality. The perspectives and challenges of current proteomimetic designs and tools are also discussed in relation to future applications.

         <title>Ferroelectric Transistors for Memory and Neuromorphic Device Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments in hafnia&#8208;based ferroelectric materials and their applications are comprehensively reviewed, with an in&#8208;depth analysis of ferroelectric transistors and their array structures. The relevant technological issues and their solutions are also discussed. This review provides a roadmap for the development of high&#8208;performance ferroelectric memory and neuromorphic devices based on ferroelectric transistors.








Abstract
Ferroelectric materials have been intensively investigated for high&#8208;performance nonvolatile memory devices in the past decades, owing to their nonvolatile polarization characteristics. Ferroelectric memory devices are expected to exhibit lower power consumption and higher speed than conventional memory devices. However, non&#8208;complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) compatibility and degradation due to fatigue of traditional perovskite&#8208;based ferroelectric materials have hindered the development of high&#8208;density and high&#8208;performance ferroelectric memories in the past. The recently developed hafnia&#8208;based ferroelectric materials have attracted immense attention in the development of advanced semiconductor devices. Because hafnia is typically used in CMOS processes, it can be directly incorporated into current semiconductor technologies. Additionally, hafnia&#8208;based ferroelectrics show high scalability and large coercive fields that are advantageous for high&#8208;density memory devices. This review summarizes the recent developments in ferroelectric devices, especially ferroelectric transistors, for next&#8208;generation memory and neuromorphic applications. First, the types of ferroelectric memories and their operation mechanisms are reviewed. Then, issues limiting the realization of high&#8208;performance ferroelectric transistors and possible solutions are discussed. The experimental demonstration of ferroelectric transistor arrays, including 3D ferroelectric NAND and its operation characteristics, are also reviewed. Finally, challenges and strategies toward the development of next&#8208;generation memory and neuromorphic applications based on ferroelectric transistors are outlined.

         <title>CoTe2: A Quantum Critical Dirac Metal with Strong Spin Fluctuations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CoTe2 crystallizes in an orthorhombic marcasite structure. Calculations and transport measurements show presence of multiple nodal Dirac lines extending through the Fermi surface. Magnetic properties reveal this compound to be close to ferromagnetism, suppressed by spin fluctuations. This compound harbors a rare combination of proximity to quantum criticality and Dirac topology.








Abstract
Quantum critical points separating weak ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases trigger many novel phenomena. Dynamical spin fluctuations not only suppress the long&#8208;range order, but can also lead to unusual transport and even superconductivity. Combining quantum criticality with topological electronic properties presents a rare and unique opportunity. Here, by means of ab initio calculations and magnetic, thermal, and transport measurements, it is&#160;shown that the orthorhombic CoTe2 is close to ferromagnetism, which appears suppressed by spin fluctuations. Calculations and transport measurements reveal nodal Dirac lines, making it a rare combination of proximity to quantum criticality and Dirac&#160;topology.

         <title>Deciphering Structural Origins of Highly Reversible Lithium Storage in High Entropy Oxides with In Situ Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, distinct reaction dynamics and phase transformations during (de)lithiation of rocksalt high&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs) are visualized by in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) methodology, revealing composition&#8208;dependent conversion/alloying reaction kinetics and spatiotemporal variations of valence states. Unexpectedly, the post&#8208;lithiation polyphase can be fully and reversibly recovered to the original rocksalt structure upon delithiation. These findings afford valuable guidelines to compositionally engineer novel HEO electrodes.








Abstract
Configurational entropy&#8208;stabilized single&#8208;phase high&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs) have been considered revolutionary electrode materials with both reversible lithium storage and high specific capacity that are difficult to fulfill simultaneously by conventional electrodes. However, precise understanding of lithium storage mechanisms in such HEOs remains controversial due to complex multi&#8208;cationic oxide systems. Here, distinct reaction dynamics and structural evolutions in rocksalt&#8208;type HEOs upon cycling are carefully studied by in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) including imaging, electron diffraction, and electron energy loss spectroscopy at atomic scale. The mechanisms of composition&#8208;dependent conversion/alloying reaction kinetics along with spatiotemporal variations of valence states upon lithiation are revealed, characterized by disappearance of the original rocksalt phase. Unexpectedly, it is found from the first visualization evidence that the post&#8208;lithiation polyphase state can be recovered to the original rocksalt&#8208;structured HEOs via reversible and symmetrical delithiation reactions, which is unavailable for monometallic oxide systems. Rigorous electrochemical tests coupled with postmortem ex situ TEM and bulk&#8208;level phase analyses further validate the crucial role of structural recovery capability in ensuring the reversible high&#8208;capacity Li&#8208;storage in HEOs. These findings can provide valuable guidelines to design compositionally engineer HEOs for almighty electrodes of next&#8208;generation long&#8208;life energy storage devices.

         <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;Mediated Radiotherapy Remodels the Tumor Microenvironment to Enhance Antitumor Efficacy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The principles of radiotherapy (RT) and radiosensitization, the mechanisms of radio&#8208;resistance and immune suppression, and the use of various nanoparticles to sensitize RT are discussed and tumor microenvironments (TMEs) for enhanced antitumor efficacy are remodeled. The challenges in clinical translation of multifunctional TME&#8208;remodeling nanoradiosensitizers are also highlighted.








Abstract
Radiotherapy (RT) uses ionizing radiation to eradicate localized tumors and, in rare cases, control tumors outside of the irradiated fields via stimulating an antitumor immune response (abscopal effect). However, the therapeutic effect of RT is often limited by inherent physiological barriers of the tumor microenvironment (TME), such as hypoxia, abnormal vasculature, dense extracellular matrix (ECM), and an immunosuppressive TME. Thus, it is critical to develop new RT strategies that can remodel the TME to overcome radio&#8208;resistance and immune suppression. In the past decade, high&#8208;Z&#8208;element nanoparticles have been developed to increase radiotherapeutic indices of localized tumors by reducing X&#8208;ray doses and side effects to normal tissues and enhance abscopal effects by activating the TME to elicit systemic antitumor immunity. In this review, the principles of RT and radiosensitization, the mechanisms of radio&#8208;resistance and immune suppression, and the use of various nanoparticles to sensitize RT and remodel TMEs for enhanced antitumor efficacy are discussed. The challenges in clinical translation of multifunctional TME&#8208;remodeling nanoradiosensitizers are also highlighted.

         <title>RNA&#8208;Targeting Carbon Dots for Live&#8208;Cell Imaging of Granule Dynamics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RNA&#8208;targeting, red&#8208;emissive carbon dots&#160;(M&#8208;CDs)&#160;are synthesized, microwave&#8208;assisted, by elaborately choosing precursors and spatial organization of the emission centers and recognition motifs. The as&#8208;synthesized M&#8208;CDs show bulk RNA binding and labeling capability in live cells and are further utilized for high&#8208;resolution spatiotemporal imaging of granules dynamics under oxidative stress.








Abstract
It is significant to monitor the different RNA granules dynamics and phase separation process inside cells under various stresses, for example, oxidative stress. The current small&#8208;molecule RNA probes work well only in fixed cells and usually encounter problems such as insufficient stability and biocompatibility, and thus a specific RNA&#8208;targeting fluorescent nanoprobe that&#160;can be used in the living cells is urgently desired. Here, the de novo design and microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis of a novel RNA&#8208;targeting, red&#8208;emissive carbon dots (named as M&#8208;CDs) are reported by choosing neutral red and levofloxacin as precursors. The as&#8208;synthesized M&#8208;CDs is water&#8208;soluble with a high fluorescence quantum yield of 22.83% and can selectively bind to RNA resulting in an enhanced red fluorescence. More interestingly, such an RNA&#8208;targeting, red&#8208;emissive M&#8208;CDs can be fast internalized into cells within 5&#160;s and thus used for real&#8208;time imaging the dynamic process of intracellular stress granules under oxidative stress, revealing some characteristics of granules that have not been identified by previously reported RNA and protein biomarkers. This research paves a new pathway for visualizing bulk RNA dynamics and studying phase&#8208;separation behaviors in living cells by rational design of the fluorescent carbon dots in terms of structure and functionality.

         <title>Modulations in Superconductors: Probes of Underlying Physics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulations in superconductors are summarized comprehensively, which includes state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques and those established methods. The significance of modulations in exploring the superconductivity is highlighted by applications into several newly discovered superconductors. Three directions for development of modulations are also outlined.








Abstract
The importance of modulations is elevated to an unprecedented level, due to the delicate conditions required to bring out exotic phenomena in quantum materials, such as topological materials, magnetic materials, and superconductors. Recently, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art modulation techniques in material science, such as electric&#8208;double&#8208;layer transistor, piezoelectric&#8208;based strain apparatus, angle twisting, and nanofabrication, have been utilized in superconductors. They not only efficiently increase the tuning capability to the broader ranges but also extend the tuning dimensionality to unprecedented degrees of freedom, including quantum fluctuations of competing phases, electronic correlation, and phase coherence essential to global superconductivity. Here, for a comprehensive review, these techniques together with the established modulation methods, such as elemental substitution, annealing, and polarization&#8208;induced gating, are contextualized. Depending on the mechanism of each method, the modulations are categorized into stoichiometric manipulation, electrostatic gating, mechanical modulation, and geometrical design. Their recent advances are highlighted by applications in newly discovered superconductors, e.g., nickelates, Kagome metals, and magic&#8208;angle graphene. Overall, the review is to provide systematic modulations in emergent superconductors and serve as the coordinate for future investigations, which can stimulate researchers in superconductivity and other fields to perform various modulations toward a thorough understanding of quantum materials.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advancements in integrated sample preparations and nucleic acid (NA) detection are reported for rapid and accurate home diagnostics. Automated sample preparation methods of blood, urine, nasal swabs, saliva, or stool that can be integrated with NA amplification on a single device are highlighted. Recent progress, challenges, and perspectives of user&#8208;friendly integrated molecular diagnostics at home are discussed.








Abstract
The global outbreaks of infectious diseases have significantly driven an imperative demand for rapid and accurate molecular diagnostics. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) feature high sensitivity and high specificity; however, the labor&#8208;intensive sample preparation and nucleic acid amplification steps remain challenging in order to carry out rapid and precision molecular diagnostics at home. This review discusses the advances and challenges of automatic solutions of sample preparation integrated with on&#8208;chip nucleic acid amplification for effective and accurate molecular diagnostics at home. The sample preparation methods of whole blood, urine, saliva/nasal swab, and stool on chip are examined. Then, the repurposable integrated sample preparation on a chip using various biological samples is investigated. Finally, the on&#8208;chip NAATs that can be integrated with automated sample preparation are evaluated. The user&#8208;friendly approaches with combined sample preparation and NAATs can be the game changers for next&#8208;generation rapid and precision home diagnostics.

         <title>Oxidization&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Triggered Rapid Preparation of Large&#8208;Area Single&#8208;Crystal Cu(111) Foil</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through low&#8208;temperature oxidization of polycrystalline Cu foils, rapid preparation of large&#8208;area single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) (up to 320 cm2) is achieved within 60 min, thanks to the transformation of the thin CuxO layer to a Cu(111) seed layer. Large&#8208;size high&#8208;quality graphene films are synthesized on the single&#8208;crystal Cu(111), and the graphene/Cu(111) composites exhibit enhanced thermal conductivity and ductility compared to their polycrystalline counterpart.








Abstract
The controlled preparation of single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) is intensively investigated owing to the superior properties of Cu(111) and its advantages in synthesizing high&#8208;quality 2D materials, especially graphene. However, the accessibility of large&#8208;area single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) is still hindered by time&#8208;consuming, complicated, and high&#8208;cost preparation methods. Here, the oxidization&#8208;temperature&#8208;triggered rapid preparation of large&#8208;area single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) in which an area up to 320 cm2 is prepared within 60 min, and where low&#8208;temperature oxidization of polycrystalline Cu foil surface plays a vital role, is reported. A mechanism is proposed, by which the thin CuxO layer transforms to a Cu(111) seed layer on the surface of Cu to induce the formation of a large&#8208;area Cu(111) foil, which is supported by both experimental data and molecular dynamics simulation results. In addition, a large&#8208;size high&#8208;quality graphene film is synthesized on the single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) foil surface and the graphene/Cu(111) composites exhibit enhanced thermal conductivity and ductility compared to their polycrystalline counterpart. This work, therefore, not only provides a new avenue toward the monocrystallinity of Cu with specific planes but also contributes to improving the mass production of high&#8208;quality 2D materials.

Top right: a fractional hopfion with a non&#8208;integer Hopf index of 0.8 simulated in a 150&#8208;mT field in a thin FeGe.

Abstract
3D topological spin textures&#8212;hopfions&#8212;are predicted in helimagnetic systems but are not experimentally confirmed thus far. By utilizing an external magnetic field and electric current in the present study, 3D topological spin textures are realized, including fractional hopfions with nonzero topological index, in a skyrmion&#8208;hosting helimagnet FeGe. Microsecond current pulses are employed to control the dynamics of the expansion and contraction of a bundle composed of a skyrmion and a fractional hopfion, as well as its current&#8208;driven Hall motion. This research approach has demonstrated the novel electromagnetic properties of fractional hopfions and their ensembles in helimagnetic systems.

         <title>Silk Fibroin and Sericin Differentially Potentiate the Paracrine and Regenerative Functions of Stem Cells Through Multiomics Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silk fibroin (SF) and sericin (SS), the two major proteins of silk, potentiate the paracrine functions of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) by differentially activating the integrin/PI3K/Akt and glycolysis signaling pathways. The SF&#8208; and SS&#8208;initiated paracrine signals of MSCs modulate the behaviors of multiple resident cells in the skin wound microenvironments and thereby improve skin regeneration with structural and functional recovery.








Abstract
Silk fibroin (SF) and sericin (SS), the two major proteins of silk, are attractive biomaterials with great potential in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. However, their biochemical interactions with stem cells remain unclear. In this study, multiomics are employed to obtain a global view of the cellular processes and pathways of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) triggered by SF and SS to discern cell&#8211;biomaterial interactions at an in&#8208;depth, high&#8208;throughput molecular level. Integrated RNA sequencing and proteomic analysis confirm that SF and SS initiate widespread but distinct cellular responses and potentiate the paracrine functions of MSCs that regulate extracellular matrix deposition, angiogenesis, and immunomodulation through differentially activating the integrin/PI3K/Akt and glycolysis signaling pathways. These paracrine signals of MSCs stimulated by SF and SS effectively improve skin regeneration by regulating the behavior of multiple resident cells (fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and macrophages) in the skin wound microenvironment. Compared to SS, SF exhibits better immunomodulatory effects in vitro and in vivo, indicating its greater potential as a carrier material of MSCs for skin regeneration. This study provides comprehensive and reliable insights into the cellular interactions with SF and SS, enabling the future development of silk&#8208;based therapeutics for tissue engineering and stem cell therapy.

         <title>Ionic Liquid &#8220;Water Pocket&#8221; for Stable and Environment&#8208;Adaptable Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;hydrophobic ionic liquid binary system is found to experience spontaneous miscibility transition by introducing Zn salts bearing amphiphilic functional group, forming a novel class of aqueous electrolytes, in which the ionic liquid species function as a &#8220;water pocket&#8221; to envelop the highly active H2O&#8208;dominated Zn2+ solvates and protect them from parasitic reactions during the operation of zinc metal batteries.








Abstract
The strong reactivity of water in aqueous electrolytes toward metallic zinc (Zn), especially at aggressive operating conditions, remains the fundamental obstacle to the commercialization of aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs). Here, a water&#8208;immiscible ionic liquid diluent 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(fluorosulfonyl)amide (EmimFSI) is reported that can substantially suppress the water activity of aqueous electrolyte by serving as a &#8220;water pocket&#8221;, enveloping the highly active H2O&#8208;dominated Zn2+ solvates and protecting them from parasitic reactions. During Zn deposition, the cation Emim+ and anion FSI&#8722; function respectively in mitigating the tip effect and regulating the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), thereby favoring a smooth Zn deposition layer protected by inorganic species&#8208;enriched SEI featuring high uniformity and stability. Combined with the boosted chemical/electrochemical stability endowed by the intrinsic merits of ionic liquid, this ionic liquid&#8208;incorporated aqueous electrolyte (IL&#8208;AE) enables the stable operation of Zn||Zn0.25V2O5&#183;nH2O cells even at a challenging temperature of 60&#160;&#176;C (&gt;85% capacity retention over 400 cycles). Finally, as an incidental but practically valuable benefit, the near&#8208;zero vapor pressure nature of ionic liquid allows the efficient separation and recovery of high&#8208;value components from the spent electrolyte via a mild and green approach, promising the sustainable future of IL&#8208;AE in realizing practical AZMBs.

         <title>Micro&#8208;Scale Mechanical Metamaterial with a Controllable Transition in the Poisson's Ratio and Band Gap Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a novel micro&#8208;scale mechanical metamaterial is proposed that can undergo a magnetically induced transition from one type of configuration to another, with one configuration being strongly auxetic and the other having a highly positive Poisson's ratio. The system allows to also concurrently control the band gap formation.








Abstract
The ability to significantly change the mechanical and wave propagation properties of a structure without rebuilding it is currently one of the main challenges in the field of mechanical metamaterials. This stems from the enormous appeal that such tunable behavior may offer from the perspective of applications ranging from biomedical to protective devices, particularly in the case of micro&#8208;scale systems. In this work, a novel micro&#8208;scale mechanical metamaterial is proposed that can undergo a transition from one type of configuration to another, with one configuration having a very negative Poisson's ratio, corresponding to strong auxeticity, and the other having a highly positive Poisson's ratio. The formation of phononic band gaps can also be controlled concurrently which can be very useful for the design of vibration dampers and sensors. Finally, it is experimentally shown that the reconfiguration process can be induced and controlled remotely through application of a magnetic field by using appropriately distributed magnetic inclusions.

         <title>When Polymorphism in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Enables Water Sorption Profile Tunability for Enhancing Heat Allocation and Water Harvesting Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cis&#8208; or trans&#8208;&#181;&#8208;OH&#8208;connectivity in the corner&#8208;sharing chains of AlO6 octahedra in water stable microporous aluminum&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks leads to two polymorphs, which solely differ in the straight or helical&#8208;shape of the chains. This polymorphism is associated with a drastic change in their water sorption behavior in a view of tuning the heat allocation and water harvesting performances.








Abstract
The development of thermally driven water&#8208;sorption&#8208;based technologies relies on high&#8208;performing water vapor adsorbents. Here, polymorphism in Al&#8211;metal&#8211;organic frameworks is disclosed as a new strategy to tune the hydrophilicity of MOFs. This involves the formation of MOFs built from chains of either trans&#8208; or cis&#8208; &#181;&#8208;OH&#8208;connected corner&#8208;sharing AlO4(OH)2 octahedra. Specifically, [Al(OH)(muc)] or MIP&#8208;211, is made of trans, trans&#8208;muconate linkers, and cis&#8208;&#181;&#8208;OH&#8208;connected corner&#8208;sharing AlO4(OH)2 octahedra giving a 3D network with sinusoidal channels. The polymorph MIL&#8208;53&#8208;muc has a tiny change in the chain structure that results in a shift of the step position of the water isotherm from P/P0&#160;&#8776; 0.5 in MIL&#8208;53&#8208;muc, to P/P0&#160;&#8776; 0.3 in MIP&#8208;211. Solid&#8208;state NMR and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo reveal that the adsorption occurs initially between two hydroxyl groups of the chains, favored by the cis&#8208;positioning in MIP&#8208;211, resulting in a more hydrophilic behavior. Finally, theoretical evaluations show that MIP&#8208;211 would allow achieving a coefficient of performance for cooling (COPc) of 0.63 with an ultralow driving temperature of 60&#160;&#176;C, outperforming benchmark sorbents for small temperature lifts. Combined with its high stability, easy regeneration, huge water uptake capacity, green synthesis, MIP&#8208;211 is among the best adsorbents for adsorption&#8208;driven air conditioning and water harvesting from the air.

         <title>Dynamic Stabilization of Metastable States in Triple&#8208;Well Ferroelectric Sn2P2S6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic hysteresis loops in nanoscale volumes reveal the signatures of a triple potential well, wherein a transient metastable state with zero polarization separates the transition between stable polarization states. The zero state is distinct from a domain wall, and it enhances mem&#8208;capacitive behavior with voltage&#8208;history dependent change of local dielectric properties.








Abstract
Polarization dynamics in ferroelectric materials is governed by the effective potential energy landscape of the order parameter. The unique aspect of ferroelectrics compared to many other transitions is the possibility of more than two potential wells, leading to complicated energy landscapes with new fundamental and functional properties. Here, direct dynamic evidence is revealed of a triple&#8208;well potential in the metal thiophosphate Sn2P2S6 compound using multivariate scanning probe microscopy combined with theoretical simulations. The key finding is that the metastable zero polarization state can be accessed through a gradual switching process and is stabilized over a broad range of electric fields. Simulations confirm that the observed zero polarization state originates from a kinetic stabilization of the nonpolar state of the triple&#8208;well, as opposed to domain walls. Dynamically, the triple&#8208;well of Sn2P2S6 becomes equivalent to antiferroelectric hysteresis loops. Therefore, this material combines the robust and well&#8208;defined domain structure of a proper ferroelectric with dynamic hysteresis loops present in antiferroelectrics. Moreover, the triple&#8208;well enhances mem&#8208;capacitive effects in Sn2P2S6, which are forbidden for ideal double&#8208;well ferroelectrics. These findings provide a path to tunable electronic elements for beyond binary high&#8208;density computing devices and neuromorphic circuits based on dynamic properties of the triple&#8208;well.

         <title>Repeatedly Recyclable 3D Printing Catalyst&#8208;Free Dynamic Thermosetting Photopolymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalyst&#8208;free dynamic thermosetting photopolymers are developed by immobilized the catalyst&#8208;free reversible bonds into the photopolymers, that can enable users to realize repeatable 3D printing. The generated resins demonstrate controllable mechanical properties with elastomeric behaviors to thermadapt shape memory polymers. Furthermore, the resulting network presents an on&#8208;demand, repeatedly recyclable thermosetting photopolymer platform for sustainable 3D printing.








Abstract
Photo&#8208;curing 3D printing technology has promoted the advanced manufacturing in various fields, but has exacerbated the environmental crisis by the demand for the chemically cross&#8208;linked thermosetting photopolymers. Here, the authors report a generic strategy to develop catalyst&#8208;free dynamic thermosetting photopolymers, based on photopolymerization and transesterification, that can enable users to realize repeatable 3D printing, providing a practical solution to the environmental challenges. That the &#946;&#8208;carbonyl group adjacent to the ester group greatly accelerates the rate of transesterification is demonstrated. The generated resins from the immobilization of the catalyst&#8208;free reversible bonds into the photopolymers leads to a dynamic covalently crosslinked network structure upon UV based 3D printing, which exhibit controllable mechanical properties with elastomeric behaviors to thermadapt shape memory polymers. Furthermore, the resulting network can be reverted into an acrylate&#8208;functioned photopolymer that is suitable for 3D printing again, presenting an on&#8208;demand, repeatedly recyclable thermosetting photopolymer platform for sustainable 3D printing.

         <title>Ultrabroadband Imaging Based on Wafer&#8208;Scale Tellurene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wafer&#8208;scale tellurene is synthesized under room temperature by exploiting pulsed&#8208;laser deposition. On this basis, tellurene&#8208;based photodetector arrays are constructed, manifesting outstanding photosensitivity with the optimal responsivity, external quantum efficiency, and detectivity of 2.7&#160;&#215; 107 A&#160;W&#8722;1, 8.2&#160;&#215; 109%, and 4.5 &#215; 1015&#160;Jones. Moreover, proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept ultrabroadband optical imaging is realized.








Abstract
High&#8208;resolution imaging is at the heart of the revolutionary breakthroughs of intelligent technologies, and it is established as an important approach toward high&#8208;sensitivity information extraction/storage. However, due to the incompatibility between non&#8208;silicon optoelectronic materials and traditional integrated circuits as well as the lack of competent photosensitive semiconductors in the infrared region, the development of ultrabroadband imaging is severely impeded.

&lt;p&gt;Wafer-scale tellurene is synthesized under room temperature by exploiting pulsed-laser deposition. On this basis, tellurene-based photodetector arrays are constructed, manifesting outstanding photosensitivity with the optimal responsivity, external quantum efficiency, and detectivity of 2.7&#160;&#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; A&#160;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 8.2&#160;&#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;%, and 4.5 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;Jones. Moreover, proof-of-concept ultrabroadband optical imaging is realized.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-resolution imaging is at the heart of the revolutionary breakthroughs of intelligent technologies, and it is established as an important approach toward high-sensitivity information extraction/storage. However, due to the incompatibility between non-silicon optoelectronic materials and traditional integrated circuits as well as the lack of competent photosensitive semiconductors in the infrared region, the development of ultrabroadband imaging is severely impeded. Herein, the monolithic integration of wafer-scale tellurene photoelectric functional units by exploiting room-temperature pulsed-laser deposition is realized. Taking advantage of the surface plasmon polaritons of tellurene, which results in the thermal perturbation promoted exciton separation, in situ formation of out-of-plane homojunction and negative expansion promoted carrier transport, as well as the band bending promoted electron&#8211;hole pair separation enabled by the unique interconnected nanostrip morphology, the tellurene photodetectors demonstrate wide-spectrum photoresponse from 370.6 to 2240&#160;nm and unprecedented photosensitivity with the optimized responsivity, external quantum efficiency and detectivity of 2.7&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;A&#160;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 8.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;% and 4.5 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;Jones. An ultrabroadband imager is demonstrated and high-resolution photoelectric imaging is realized. The proof-of-concept wafer-scale tellurene-based ultrabroadband photoelectric imaging system depicts a fascinating paradigm for the development of an advanced 2D imaging platform toward next-generation intelligent equipment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
