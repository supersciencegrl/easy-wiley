         <title>A Dendrite&#8208;Free Tin Anode for High&#8208;Energy Aqueous Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal anode based on the Sn(OH)62&#8722;/Sn redox couple at &#8722;0.921 V vs standard hydrogen electrode is reported. In contrast to severe Zn dendrites, Sn metal prefers isotropic crystal growth without dendrites, leading to superior performance in lifespan and areal capacity in Sn&#8211;I cells. The Sn anode represents a promising electrode candidate for metal&#8208;based rechargeable aqueous batteries.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;based aqueous redox flow batteries (ARFBs) such as zinc&#8208;based ARFBs have attracted remarkable attention owing to their intrinsic high energy density. However, severe dendrite issues limit their efficiency and lifespan. Here an aqueous metal anode operating between Sn(OH)62&#8722; (stannate) and metal Sn is presented, providing a reversible four&#8208;electron transfer at &#8722;0.921 V vs standard hydrogen electrode. In strong contrast to severe Zn dendrites, the Sn(OH)62&#8722;/Sn electrode shows smooth and dendrite&#8208;free morphology, which can be attributed to its intrinsic low&#8208;surface&#8208;energy anisotropy which facilitates isotropic crystal growth of Sn metal. By coupling with iodide/tri&#8208;iodide (I&#8722;/I3&#8722;), the static Sn&#8211;I cell demonstrates a stable cycling for 500 cycles (more than 2 months). In contrast, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Zn anode suffers from serious dendrites and lasts less than 45 cycles (190 h) in Zn&#8211;I cells. A stable continuous flow cycling of Sn&#8211;I cell achieves a Sn areal capacity of 73.07 mAh cm&#8722;2 at an average discharge voltage of 1.3 V for 350 h. The alkaline Sn electrode demonstrates dendrite&#8208;free morphology and superior performance in cycle life and areal capacity compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Zn metal anodes, offering a promising metal anode for high&#8208;energy ARFBs and other metal&#8208;based rechargeable aqueous batteries.

         <title>Epitaxial Single&#8208;Crystal Growth of Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Monolayers via the Atomic Sawtooth Au Surface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomic sawtooth Au surface allows the anisotropic adsorption energy of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMdC) clusters to yield unidirectional epitaxial growth of triangular TMdC grains, eventually forming a single&#8208;crystal TMdC film, regardless of the Miller indices. Growth using the atomic sawtooth gold surface as a universal growth template is further demonstrated for several TMdC monolayer films, including WS2, WSe2, MoS2, the MoSe2/WSe2 heterostructure, and W1&#8722;xMoxS2 alloys.








Abstract
Growth of 2D van der Waals layered single&#8208;crystal (SC) films is highly desired not only to manifest the intrinsic physical and chemical properties of materials, but also to enable the development of unprecedented devices for industrial applications. While wafer&#8208;scale SC hexagonal boron nitride film has been successfully grown, an ideal growth platform for diatomic transition metal dichalcogenide (TMdC) films has not been established to date. Here, the SC growth of TMdC monolayers on a centimeter scale via the atomic sawtooth gold surface as a universal growth template is reported. The atomic tooth&#8208;gullet surface is constructed by the one&#8208;step solidification of liquid gold, evidenced by transmission electron microscopy. The anisotropic adsorption energy of the TMdC cluster, confirmed by density&#8208;functional calculations, prevails at the periodic atomic&#8208;step edge to yield unidirectional epitaxial growth of triangular TMdC grains, eventually forming the SC film, regardless of the Miller indices. Growth using the atomic sawtooth gold surface as a universal growth template is demonstrated for several TMdC monolayer films, including WS2, WSe2, MoS2, the MoSe2/WSe2 heterostructure, and W1&#8722;xMoxS2 alloys. This strategy provides a general avenue for the SC growth of diatomic van der Waals heterostructures on a wafer scale, to further facilitate the applications of TMdCs in post&#8208;silicon technology.

         <title>Tunable Linearity of High&#8208;Performance Vertical Dual&#8208;Gate vdW Phototransistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vertical dual&#8208;gate van der Waals (vdW) phototransistors are fabricated based on the ambipolar WSe2. With the tunability of the opposite dual&#8208;gating, a linear photoresponse can be obtained with a high responsivity and low noise level, resulting in a high detectivity. The linear photoresponse with high performance of these phototransistors offers the possibility of achieving high&#8208;resolution and quantitative light detection with layered 2D semiconductors.








Abstract
Layered 2D semiconductors have been widely exploited in photodetectors due to their excellent electronic and optoelectronic properties. To improve their performance, photogating, photoconductive, photovoltaic, photothermoelectric, and other effects have been used in phototransistors and photodiodes made with 2D semiconductors or hybrid structures. However, it is difficult to achieve the desired high responsivity and linear photoresponse simultaneously in a monopolar conduction channel or a p&#8211;n junction. Here, dual&#8208;channel conduction with ambipolar multilayer WSe2 is presented by employing the device concept of dual&#8208;gate phototransistor, where p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type channels are produced in the same semiconductor using opposite dual&#8208;gating. It is possible to tune the photoconductive gain using a vertical electric field, so that the gain is constant with respect to the light intensity&#8212;a linear photoresponse, with a high responsivity of &#8776;2.5 &#215; 104 A W&#8722;1. Additionally, the 1/f noise of the device is kept at a low level under the opposite dual&#8208;gating due to the reduction of current and carrier fluctuation, resulting in a high detectivity of &#8776;2 &#215; 1013 Jones in the linear photoresponse regime. The linear photoresponse and high performance of the dual&#8208;gate WSe2 phototransistor offer the possibility of achieving high&#8208;resolution and quantitative light detection with layered 2D semiconductors.

         <title>Electrically Tunable Singular Phase and Goos&#8211;H&#228;nchen Shifts in Phase&#8208;Change&#8208;Material&#8208;Based Thin&#8208;Film Coatings as Optical Absorbers</title>

         <dc:description>
Electrically tunable phase and Goos&#8211;H&#228;nchen (G&#8211;H)&#160;shifts in the visible wavelengths using an innovative design of lithography&#8208;free nanophotonic cavities are experimentally presented. By using the temperature&#8208;induced refractive index changes of transparent dielectric film and the structural phase&#8208;change properties of chalcogenide phase&#8208;change material, wide tunability in G&#8211;H&#160;shift at the singular phase of light is demonstrated.








Abstract
The change of the phase of light under the evolution of a nanomaterial with time is a promising new research direction. A phenomenon directly related to the sudden phase change of light is the Goos&#8211;H&#228;nchen&#160;(G&#8211;H) shift, which describes the lateral beam displacement of the reflected light from the interface of two media when the angles of incidence are close to the total internal reflection angle or Brewster angle. Here, an innovative design of lithography&#8208;free nanophotonic cavities to realize electrically tunable G&#8211;H shifts at the singular phase of light in the visible wavelengths is reported. Reversible electrical tuning of phase and G&#8211;H shifts is experimentally demonstrated using a microheater integrated optical cavity consisting of a dielectric film on an absorbing substrate through a Joule heating mechanism. In particular, an enhanced G&#8211;H shift of 110 times of the operating wavelength at the Brewster angle of the thin&#8208;film cavity is reported. More importantly, electrically tunable G&#8211;H shifts are demonstrated by exploiting the significant tunable phase change that occurs at the Brewster angles, due to the small temperature&#8208;induced refractive index changes of the dielectric film. Realizing efficient electrically tunable G&#8211;H shifts with miniaturized heaters will extend the research scope of the G&#8211;H shift phenomenon and its applications.

Here, an innovative design of lithography&#8208;free nanophotonic cavities to realize electrically tunable G&#8211;H shifts at the singular phase of light in the visible wavelengths is reported. Reversible electrical tuning of phase and G&#8211;H shifts is experimentally demonstrated using a microheater integrated optical cavity consisting of a dielectric film on an absorbing substrate through a Joule heating mechanism. In particular, an enhanced G&#8211;H shift of 110 times of the operating wavelength at the Brewster angle of the thin&#8208;film cavity is reported. More importantly, electrically tunable G&#8211;H shifts are demonstrated by exploiting the significant tunable phase change that occurs at the Brewster angles, due to the small temperature&#8208;induced refractive index changes of the dielectric film. Realizing efficient electrically tunable G&#8211;H shifts with miniaturized heaters will extend the research scope of the G&#8211;H shift phenomenon and its applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Fluorescent Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Food Real&#8208;Time Visual Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart color&#8208;variation evaluation system based on a fluorescent metal&#8211;organic framework probe and smartphone&#8208;based portable device is designed for on&#8208;site inspection of food quality. The freshness of raw fish samples can be accurately and monitored in real time by the naked eye by the clearly distinguishable color transition from orange red to green.








Abstract
Due to increasing food&#8208;safety issues, exploiting efficient approaches for food quality assessment and instrumentation has attracted concerns worldwide. Herein, a smart evaluation system based on a fluorescent metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) is developed for real&#8208;time visual monitoring of food freshness. Via post&#8208;synthetic modification, a ratiometric fluorescent MOF probe is constructed by covalently coupling fluorescein 5&#8208;isothiocyanate (5&#8208;FITC) with NH2&#8208;rich lanthanide MOF. The probes exhibit a dual&#8208;emissive&#8208;responsive to biogenic amine, resulting in an increase in FITC emission along with a decrease in Eu3+ emission accompanied by a clear distinguishable color transition from orange red to green. After doping the probes on a flexible substrate, the obtained MOF composite film can be integrated with a smartphone&#8208;based portable platform easily. It is proved that this smart evaluation system can be used for on&#8208;site inspection of the freshness of raw fish samples. This work develops a fluorescent MOF&#8208;based smart evaluation system as a novel platform for application in food monitoring, which not only has enormous economic value but also holds great public health significance.

         <title>CoPSe: A New Ternary Anode Material for Stable and High&#8208;Rate Sodium/Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;phase ternary cobalt phosphoselenide nanoparticles embedded in layered metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;derived N&#8208;doped carbon matrix (CoPSe/NC) are fabricated through in situ synchronous phosphorization/selenization reactions using the MOF as both a template and precursor. The CoPSe/NC anode holds a set of intrinsic merits relative to its counterparts of CoSe2 or CoPS, representing an ultrastable, high&#8208;rate, and high&#8208;energy anode material for sodium/potassium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
The exploration of ideal electrode materials overcoming the critical problems of large electrode volume changes and sluggish redox kinetics induced by large ionic radius of Na+/K+ ions is highly desirable for sodium/potassium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs/PIBs) toward large&#8208;scale applications. The present work demonstrates that single&#8208;phase ternary cobalt phosphoselenide (CoPSe) in the form of nanoparticles embedded in a layered metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;derived N&#8208;doped carbon matrix (CoPSe/NC) represents an ultrastable and high&#8208;rate anode material for SIBs/PIBs. The CoPSe/NC is fabricated by using the MOF as both a template and precursor, coupled with in situ synchronous phosphorization/selenization reactions. The CoPSe anode holds a set of intrinsic merits such as lower mechanical stress, enhanced reaction kinetics, as well as higher theoretical capacity and lower discharge voltage relative to its counterpart of CoSe2, and suppressed shuttle effect with higher intrinsic electrical conductivity relative to CoPS. The involved mechanisms are evidenced by substantial characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Consequently, the CoPSe/NC anode shows an outstanding long&#8208;cycle stability and rate performance for SIBs and PIBs. Moreover, the CoPSe/NC&#8208;based Na&#8208;ion full cell can achieve a higher energy density of 274&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, surpassing that based on CoSe2/NC and most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Na&#8208;ion full cells based on P&#8208;, Se&#8208;, or S&#8208;containing binary/ternary anodes to date.

         <title>Highly Stable and Active Solid&#8208;Solution&#8208;Alloy Three&#8208;Way Catalyst by Utilizing Configurational&#8208;Entropy Effect</title>

         <dc:description>
PdRuIr ternary solid&#8208;solution alloy nanoparticles exhibit highly durable and active three&#8208;way catalyst performance. This work provides insights into the design of highly durable and efficient functional alloy catalysts, guiding how to best take advantage of the configurational entropy in addition to the mixing enthalpy.








Abstract
Since 1970, people have been making every endeavor to reduce toxic emissions from automobiles. After the development of a three&#8208;way catalyst (TWC) that concurrently converts three harmful gases, carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HCs), and nitrogen oxides (NOx), Rh became an essential element in automobile technology because only Rh works efficiently for catalytic NOx reduction. However, due to the sharp price spike in 2007, numerous efforts have been made to replace Rh in TWCs. Nevertheless, Rh remains irreplaceable, and now, the price of Rh is increasing significantly again. Here, it is demonstrated that PdRuM ternary solid&#8208;solution alloy nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit highly durable and active TWC performance, which will result in a significant reduction in catalyst cost compared to Rh. This work provides insights into the design of highly durable and efficient functional alloy NPs, guiding how to best take advantage of the configurational entropy in addition to the mixing enthalpy.

         <title>Anomalous High&#8208;Temperature Superconductivity in YH6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel yttrium hexahydride YH6 is synthesized, an outstanding high&#8208;TC superconductor with critical temperature of 224&#8211;226&#160;K and unexpectedly large upper critical magnetic field &#8776;116&#8211;158 T. YH6 demonstrates high critical current density of &#8776;3500&#160;A mm&#8722;2 at 4&#160;K, which is above that of NbTi and YBCO. The study points to a possible additional nonconventional contribution to superconductivity in YH6.








Abstract
Pressure&#8208;stabilized hydrides are a new rapidly growing class of high&#8208;temperature superconductors, which is believed to be described within the conventional phonon&#8208;mediated mechanism of coupling. Here, the synthesis of one of the best&#8208;known high&#8208;TC superconductors&#8212;yttrium hexahydride Im3&#175;m&#8208;YH6 is reported, which displays a superconducting transition at &#8776;224&#160;K at 166&#160;GPa. The extrapolated upper critical magnetic field Bc2(0)&#160;of YH6 is surprisingly high: 116&#8211;158&#160;T, which is 2&#8211;2.5 times larger than the calculated value. A pronounced shift of TC in yttrium deuteride YD6 with the isotope coefficient 0.4 supports the phonon&#8208;assisted superconductivity. Current&#8211;voltage measurements show that the critical current IC and its density JC may exceed 1.75&#160;A and 3500&#160;A mm&#8722;2 at 4&#160;K, respectively, which is higher than that of the commercial superconductors, such as NbTi and YBCO. The results of superconducting density functional theory (SCDFT) and anharmonic calculations, together with anomalously high critical magnetic field, suggest notable departures of the superconducting properties from the conventional Migdal&#8211;Eliashberg and Bardeen&#8211;Cooper&#8211;Schrieffer theories, and presence of an additional mechanism of superconductivity.

         <title>Color of Copper/Copper Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically flat perfect single&#8208;crystal Cu films prepared by the atomic&#8208;sputtering epitaxy method realize the coherent propagation of an oxidation front and display full&#8208;color by controlling the oxide&#8208;layer thickness. More than 50% of the standard red/green/blue color space is covered. Laser&#8208;oxide lithography forming a microscale local oxide embedded in metal is introduced.








Abstract
Stochastic inhomogeneous oxidation is an inherent characteristic of copper (Cu), often hindering color tuning and bandgap engineering of oxides. Coherent control of the interface between metal and metal oxide remains unresolved. Coherent propagation of an oxidation front in single&#8208;crystal Cu thin film is demonstrated to achieve a full&#8208;color spectrum for Cu by precisely controlling its oxide&#8208;layer thickness. Grain&#8208;boundary&#8208;free and atomically flat films prepared by atomic&#8208;sputtering epitaxy allow tailoring of the oxide layer with an abrupt interface via heat treatment with a suppressed temperature gradient. Color tuning of nearly full&#8208;color red/green/blue indices is realized by precise control of the oxide&#8208;layer thickness; the samples cover &#8776;50.4% of the standard red/green/blue color space. The color of copper/copper oxide is realized by the reconstruction of the quantitative yield color from the oxide &#8220;pigment&#8221; (complex dielectric functions of Cu2O) and light&#8208;layer interference (reflectance spectra obtained from the Fresnel equations) to produce structural color. Furthermore, laser&#8208;oxide lithography is demonstrated with micrometer&#8208;scale linewidth and depth through local phase transformation to oxides embedded in the metal, providing spacing necessary for semiconducting transport and optoelectronics functionality.

         <title>Stable Unbiased Photo&#8208;Electrochemical Overall Water Splitting Exceeding 3% Efficiency via Covalent Triazine Framework/Metal Oxide Hybrid Photoelectrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rationally designed covalent triazine frameworks are conformably deposited on both photocathodes and photoanodes, successfully addressing the trade&#8208;off between stability and efficiency of photoelectrodes for photo&#8208;electrochemical water splitting. Coupling organic semiconductors with inorganic photoelectrodes could be a feasible means for practical photo&#8208;electrochemical water splitting.








Abstract
Photo&#8208;electrochemical (PEC) water splitting systems using oxide&#8208;based photoelectrodes are highly attractive for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion. However, despite decades&#8208;long efforts, it is still challenging to develop efficient and stable photoelectrodes for practical applications. Here, thin layers of covalent triazine frameworks (CTF&#8208;BTh) containing a bithiophene moiety are conformably deposited onto the surfaces of a Cu2O photocathode and a Mo&#8208;doped BiVO4 photoanode via electropolymerization to construct new hybrid photoelectrodes, successfully addressing the efficiency and stability issues. The CTF&#8208;BTh possesses a suitable band structure to form favorable band edge alignment with each metal oxide, creating a p&#8211;n junction and a staggered type&#8208;II heterojunction with Cu2O and Mo&#8208;doped BiVO4, respectively. Thus, the as&#8208;fabricated hybrid photoelectrodes exhibit substantially increased PEC performances. Meanwhile, the CTF&#8208;BTh film also serves as an effective corrosion&#8208;resistant overlayer for both photoelectrodes to inhibit photocorrosion and enable long&#8208;term operation for 150 h with only &#8776;10% loss in photocurrent densities. Furthermore, a stand&#8208;alone unbiased PEC tandem device comprising CTF&#8208;BTh&#8208;coated photoelectrodes exhibits 3.70% solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency. Even after continuous operation for 120 h, the efficiency can still retain at 3.24%.

         <title>General Design Methodology for Organic Eutectic Electrolytes toward High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
General formation mechanism of organic eutectic electrolytes is developed to enable highly concentrated eutectic electrolytes for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density RFBs. Organic molecules containing carbonyl, nitroxyl radical, and methoxy groups are essential to achieve eutectic systems. Furthermore, over threefold enhancement in solubility is achieved for methoxy&#8208;modified ferrocene derivative, exhibiting good cycling stability and high energy density (188&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8208;1) at solvent&#8208;free conditions.








Abstract
By virtue of strong molecular interactions, eutectic electrolytes provide highly concentrated redox&#8208;active materials without other auxiliary solvents, hence achieving high volumetric capacities and energy density for redox flow batteries (RFBs). However, it is critical to unveil the underlying mechanism in this system, which will be undoubtedly beneficial for their future research on high&#8208;energy storage systems. Herein, a general formation mechanism of organic eutectic electrolytes (OEEs) is developed, and it is found that molecules with specific functional groups such as carbonyl (C&#63742;O), nitroxyl radical (N&#63743;O&#8226;), and methoxy (OCH3) groups can coordinate with alkali metal fluorinated sulfonylimide salts (especially for bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide, TFSI), thereby forming OEEs. Molecular designs further demonstrate that the redox&#8208;inactive methoxy group functionalized ferrocene derivative maintains the liquid OEE at both reduced and oxidized states. Over threefold increase in solubility is obtained (2.8 m for ferrocene derivative OEE) and high actual discharge energy density of 188&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8208;1 (75% of the theoretical value) is achieved in the Li hybrid cell. The established mechanism presents new ways of designing desirable electrolytes through molecular interactions for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density organic RFBs.

         <title>Boosting Wide&#8208;Range Tunable Long&#8208;Afterglow in 1D Metal&#8211;Organic Halide Micro/Nanocrystals for Space/Time&#8208;Resolved Information Photonics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New metal&#8211;organic halide micro/nanocrystals with tunable afterglow luminescence, which exhibit excitation&#8208;dependent optical waveguide properties across a wide color range, as well as space/time dual&#8208;resolved afterglow, are developed. They have great potential in wavelength&#8208;division multiplexing information photonics and optical logic gates.








Abstract
Molecular afterglow materials with ultralong&#8208;lived excited states have attracted considerable interest owing to their promise for light&#8208;emitting devices, optical imaging, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications. However, the realization of ultralong afterglow emission in low&#8208;dimensional micro/nanostructures has remained an open challenge, limiting progress toward new&#8208;generation photonic applications. In this work, new types of mono/binuclear metal&#8211;organic halide micro/nanocrystals with tunable afterglow properties, made possibly by the rational control over both ultralong&#8208;lived room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence, are developed. Interestingly, the mono/binuclear coordination complexes present excitation&#8208;dependent luminescence across a wide range (wavelength &gt; 150&#160;nm) with broad emission color differences from blue to yellow owing to the multiple long&#8208;lived excited states. The 1D binuclear metal&#8211;organic microrods further exhibit excitation&#8208;dependent optical waveguide and space/time dual&#8208;resolved afterglow emission properties, endowing them with great potential in wavelength&#8208;division multiplexing information photonics and logic gates. Therefore, this work not only communicates the first example of wide&#8208;range tunable ultralong afterglow of low&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic micro/nanocrystals under ambient conditions but also provides a new route to achieve optical communications and photonic logic compilation at the micro/nanoscale.

         <title>Photodetectors of 2D Materials from Ultraviolet to Terahertz Waves</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The main mechanisms and recent significant progress of 2D material photodetectors from ultraviolet to terahertz waves are summarized. The overestimated performance of 2D material photodetectors is revealed. Photodetectors of 2D materials are compared with conventional materials, and an EIW mechanism strategy is proposed to utilize the thinness advantage of 2D materials to develop excellent photodetectors.








Abstract
2D materials are considered to be the most promising materials for photodetectors due to their unique optical and electrical properties. Since the discovery of graphene, many photodetectors based on 2D materials have been reported. However, the low quantum efficiency, large noise, and slow response caused by the thinness of 2D materials limit their application in photodetectors.

     alt="Photodetectors of 2D Materials from Ultraviolet to Terahertz Waves"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main mechanisms and recent significant progress of 2D material photodetectors from ultraviolet to terahertz waves are summarized. The overestimated performance of 2D material photodetectors is revealed. Photodetectors of 2D materials are compared with conventional materials, and an EIW mechanism strategy is proposed to utilize the thinness advantage of 2D materials to develop excellent photodetectors.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D materials are considered to be the most promising materials for photodetectors due to their unique optical and electrical properties. Since the discovery of graphene, many photodetectors based on 2D materials have been reported. However, the low quantum efficiency, large noise, and slow response caused by the thinness of 2D materials limit their application in photodetectors. Here, recent progress on 2D material photodetectors is reviewed, covering the spectrum from ultraviolet to terahertz waves. First the interaction of 2D materials with light is analyzed in terms of optical physics. Then the present methods to improve the performance of 2D material photodetectors are summarized, such as defect engineering, p&#8211;n junctions and hybrid detectors, and the issue of serious overestimation of the performance in reported photodetectors based on 2D materials is discussed. Next, a comparison of 2D material photodetectors with traditional commercially available detectors shows that it is difficult to balance the current 2D material photodetectors with regard to having simultaneously both high sensitivity and fast response. Finally, a possible novel EIW mechanism is suggested to advance the performance of 2D material photodetectors in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Efficient and Stable Red Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Operational Stability &gt;300 h</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermodynamically stable &#946;&#8208;CsPbI3 nanocrystals are prepared and are demonstrated to function as a stable, efficient red&#8208;emitting layer. With incorporation of poly(maleic anhydride&#8208;alt&#8208;1&#8208;octadecene), the &#946;&#8208;CsPbI3 further exhibits reduced deep defects of PbCs, increased exciton binding energy, and reduced longitudinal&#8208;optical phonon energy. Red&#8208;emitting perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) based on &#946;&#8208;CsPbI3 achieve both high external quantum efficiency and superior operational stability.








Abstract
The long&#8208;term operational stability of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs), especially red PeLEDs with only several hours typically, has always faced great challenges. Stable &#946;&#8208;CsPbI3 nanocrystals (NCs) are demonstrated for highly efficient and stable red&#8208;emitting PeLEDs through incorporation of poly(maleic anhydride&#8208;alt&#8208;1&#8208;octadecene) (PMA) in synthesizing the NCs. The PMA can chemically interact with PbI2 in the precursors via the coupling effect between O groups in PMA and Pb2+ to favor crystallization of stable &#946;&#8208;CsPbI3 NCs. Meanwhile, the cross&#8208;linked PMA significantly reduces the PbCs anti&#8208;site defect on the surface of the &#946;&#8208;CsPbI3 NCs. Benefiting from the improved crystal phase quality, the photoluminescence quantum yield for &#946;&#8208;CsPbI3 NCs films remarkably increases from 34% to 89%. The corresponding red&#8208;emitting PeLEDs achieves a high external quantum efficiency of 17.8% and superior operational stability with the lifetime, the time to half the initial electroluminescence intensity (T50) reaching 317 h at a constant current density of 30&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Graphene: A Disruptive Opportunity for COVID&#8208;19 and Future Pandemics?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present pandemic has motivated researchers with different backgrounds to fight against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Graphene&#8208;related materials present numerous benefits for new antiviral solutions. The interaction of graphene&#8208;related materials with viruses, their virucidal activity, and their possible use in antiviral coatings and sensing devices for fast and reliable detection are highlighted.








Abstract
The graphene revolution, which has taken place during the last 15 years, has represented a paradigm shift for science. The extraordinary properties possessed by this unique material have paved the road to a number of applications in materials science, optoelectronics, energy, and sensing. Graphene&#8208;related materials (GRMs) are now produced in large scale and have found niche applications also in the biomedical technologies, defining new standards for drug delivery and biosensing. Such advances position GRMs as novel tools to fight against the current COVID&#8208;19 and future pandemics. In this regard, GRMs can play a major role in sensing, as an active component in antiviral surfaces or in virucidal formulations. Herein, the most promising strategies reported in the literature on the use of GRM&#8208;based materials against the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic and other types of viruses are showcased, with a strong focus on the impact of functionalization, deposition techniques, and integration into devices and surface coatings.

         <title>Epitaxial Ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 with Metallic Pyrochlore Oxide Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallic pyrochlore oxide electrodes are&#160;introduced to create epitaxial&#160;Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 thin films. The emergence of the non&#8208;polar&#8208;monoclinic phase from the polar&#8208;orthorhombic phase is observed when the film thickness is &#8805;&#8776;30&#160;nm. Further tuning through such an epitaxial stabilization process can lead to the orthorhombic phase being stable over an even larger thickness range.








Abstract
The synthesis of fully epitaxial ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) thin films through the use of a conducting pyrochlore oxide electrode that acts as a structural and chemical template is reported. Such pyrochlores, exemplified by Pb2Ir2O7(PIO) and Bi2Ru2O7(BRO), exhibit metallic conductivity with room&#8208;temperature resistivity of &lt;1 m&#937; cm and are closely lattice matched to yttria&#8208;stabilized zirconia substrates as well as the HZO layers grown on top of them. Evidence for epitaxy and domain formation is established with X&#8208;ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy, which show that the c&#8208;axis of the HZO film is normal to the substrate surface. The emergence of the non&#8208;polar&#8208;monoclinic phase from the polar&#8208;orthorhombic phase is observed when the HZO film thickness is &#8805;&#8776;30&#160;nm. Thermodynamic analyses reveal the role of epitaxial strain and surface energy in stabilizing the polar phase as well as its coexistence with the non&#8208;polar&#8208;monoclinic phase as a function of film thickness.

         <title>Stabilizing Fullerene for Burn&#8208;in&#8208;Free and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells under Ultraviolet Preconditioning and Light Soaking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over 23% efficiency is achieved using a stabilized phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM):bathophenanthroline (Bphen) interlayer in SnO2&#8208;based perovskite solar cells, which can retain over 92% of their initial efficiency after 1000&#160;h continuous illumination of maximum power point tracking at 60 &#176;C.








Abstract
It is crucial to make perovskite solar cells sustainable and have a stable operation under natural light soaking before they become commercially acceptable. Herein, a small amount of the small molecule bathophenanthroline (Bphen) is introduced into [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester and it is found that Bphen can stabilize the C60&#8208;cage well through formation of much more thermodynamically stable charge&#8208;transfer complexes. Such a strengthened complex is used as an interlayer at the in&#8208;light perovskite/SnO2 side to achieve a champion device with efficiency of 23.09% (certified 22.85%). Most importantly, the stability of the resulting devices can be close to meeting the requirements of the International Electrotechnical Commission 61215 standard under simulated UV preconditioning and light&#8208;soaking testing. They can retain over 95% and 92% of their initial efficiencies after 1100 h UV irradiation and 1000 h continuous illumination of maximum power point tracking at 60&#160;&#176;C, respectively.

Most importantly, the stability of the resulting devices can be close to meeting the requirements of the International Electrotechnical Commission 61215 standard under simulated UV preconditioning and light&#8208;soaking testing. They can retain over 95% and 92% of their initial efficiencies after 1100 h UV irradiation and 1000 h continuous illumination of maximum power point tracking at 60&#160;&#176;C, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Pseudosolvent Intercalator of Chitin: Self&#8208;Exfoliating into Sub&#8208;1&#160;nm Thick Nanofibrils for Multifunctional Chitinous Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pseudosolvent&#8208;assisted intercalation process that can circumvent strong mechanical disintegration is developed to extract chitin nanofibrils. Having controllable thickness down to 0.8&#160;nm, average diameter of 4&#8211;5&#160;nm, and high aspect ratio up to 103, these ribbon&#8208;like nanofibrils can act as new building blocks to fabricate high&#8208;performance structural materials, being applicable in optics, wearable electronics, and energy devices.








Abstract
Traditionally, energy&#8208;intensive and time&#8208;consuming postmechanical disintegration processes are inevitable in extracting biopolymer nanofibrils from natural materials and thereby hinder their practical applications. Herein, a new, convenient, scalable, and energy&#8208;efficient method for exfoliating nanofibrils (ChNFs) from various chitin sources via pseudosolvent&#8208;assisted intercalation process is proposed. These self&#8208;exfoliated ChNFs possess controllable thickness from 2.2 to 0.8&#160;nm, average diameter of 4&#8211;5&#160;nm, high aspect ratio up to 103 and customized surface chemistries. Particularly, compared with elementary nanofibrils, ChNFs with few molecular layers thick exhibit greater potential to construct high&#8208;performance structural materials, e.g., ductile nanopapers with large elongation up to 70.1% and toughness as high as 30.2&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3, as well as soft hydrogels with typical nonlinear elasticity mimicking that of human&#8208;skin. The proposed self&#8208;exfoliation concept with unique advantages in the combination of high yield, energy efficiency, scalable productivity, less equipment requirements, and mild conditions opens up a door to extract biopolymer nanofibrils on an industrial scale. Moreover, the present modular ChNFs exfoliation will facilitate researchers to study the effect of thickness on the properties of nanofibrils and provide more insight into the structure&#8211;function relationship of biopolymer&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Selective Release of Different Neurotransmitters Emulated by a p&#8211;i&#8211;n Junction Synaptic Transistor for Environment&#8208;Responsive Action Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A p&#8211;i&#8211;n junction synaptic transistor is fabricated to emulate the reconfigurability of a biological synapse that expresses complex emotions of attraction or aversion. It enables high&#8208;accuracy pattern recognition, and controls artificial muscle to move in different directions in response to different external stimuli. These properties can be important in designing complex neuromorphic systems.








Abstract
The design of the first p&#8211;i&#8211;n junction synaptic transistor (JST) based on n&#8208;type TiO2 film covered with poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and with a p&#8208;type P3HT/PEO nanowire (NW) on top. Except for basic synaptic functions that can be realized by a single neurotransmitter, the electronic device emulates the multiplexed neurotransmission of different neurotransmissions, i.e., glutamate and acetylcholine, for fast switching between short&#8208; and long&#8208;term plasticity (STP and LTP). This is realized by the special p&#8211;i&#8211;n junction with hole transport in the p&#8208;type P3HT NW to form STP, and electron transport in the n&#8208;type TiO2 layer and trapped under the PMMA inversion layer to form LTP. Altering the external input induces changes of the polarity of the charge carriers in the conductive channel, promoting fast switching between STP and LTP modes. When stimulated using two parallel inputs, the response of PMMA/TiO2 emulates the synergistic effect of taste and aroma on the control of food&#8208;intake in the brain. Because of the bipolarity, the p&#8211;i&#8211;n JST has excellent reconfigurability, which importantly is attributed to simulate the plasticity of synapses and to mimic how distinct types of gustatory receptor neurons respond to different concentrations of salt. The electronic device lays the technical foundation for the realization of the future complex artificial neural networks.

         <title>Design Strategy for Transformative Electronic System toward Rapid, Bidirectional Stiffness Tuning using Graphene and Flexible Thermoelectric Device Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transformative electronics capable of rapid bidirectional stiffness tuning are developed to provide adaptive rigid and soft interfaces for versatile applications. Integration of graphene and a flexible thermoelectric device with a gallium platform facilitates the solid&#8211;liquid phase transition of the gallium, enabling accelerated rigid&#8211;soft transformation. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of reconfigurable personal electronics shows the potential of this approach, which can significantly enhance the versatility of electronics.








Abstract
Electronics with tunable shape and stiffness can be applied in broad range of applications because their tunability allows their use in either rigid handheld form or soft wearable form, depending on needs. Previous research has enabled such reconfigurable electronics by integrating a thermally tunable gallium&#8208;based platform with flexible/stretchable electronics. However, supercooling phenomenon caused in the freezing process of gallium impedes reliable and rapid bidirectional rigid&#8211;soft conversion, limiting the full potential of this type of &#8220;transformative&#8221; electronics. Here, materials and electronics design strategies are reported to develop a transformative system with a gallium platform capable of fast reversible mechanical switching. In this electronic system, graphene is used as a catalyst to accelerate the heterogeneous nucleation of gallium to mitigate the degree of supercooling. Additionally, a flexible thermoelectric device is integrated as a means to provide active temperature control to further reduce the time for the solid&#8211;liquid transition of gallium. Analytical and experimental results establish the fundamentals for the design and optimized operation of transformative electronics for accelerated bidirectional transformation. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of a reconfigurable system, which can convert between rigid handheld electronics and a flexible wearable biosensor, demonstrates the potential of this design approach for highly versatile electronics that can support multiple applications.

         <title>Approaching Crystal Structure and High Electron Mobility in Conjugated Polymer Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated polymer microwire crystals are obtained from solvated aggregates. The precise crystal packing and electronic structure in the polymer microwires are evaluated for understanding of the charge transport properties. Polymer crystal transistors of F4BDOPV&#8208;2T exhibit higher electron mobilities of up to 5.58&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 with a much lower hopping energy barrier compared with conventional thin&#8208;film transistors.








Abstract
Conjugated polymers usually form crystallized and amorphous regions in the solid state simultaneously, making it difficult to accurately determine their precise microstructures. The lack of multiscale microstructures of conjugated polymers limits the fundamental understanding of the structure&#8211;property relationships in polymer&#8208;based optoelectronic devices. Here, crystals of two typical conjugated polymers based on four&#8208;fluorinated benzodifurandione&#8208;based oligo(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (F4BDOPV) and naphthalenediimide (NDI) motifs, respectively, are obtained by a controlled self&#8208;assembly process. The strong diffractivity of the polymer crystals brings an opportunity to determine the crystal structures by combining X&#8208;ray techniques and molecular simulations. The precise polymer packing structures are useful as initial models to evaluate the charge transport properties in the ordered and disordered phases. Compared to the spin&#8208;coated thin films, the highly oriented polymer chains in crystals endow higher mobilities with a lower hopping energy barrier. Microwire crystal transistors of F4BDOPV&#8208; and NDI&#8208;based polymers exhibit high electron mobilities of up to 5.58 and 2.56&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, respectively, which are among the highest values in polymer crystals. This work presents a simple method to obtain polymer crystals and their precise microstructures, promoting a deep understanding of molecular packing and charge transport for conjugated polymers.

This work presents a simple method to obtain polymer crystals and their precise microstructures, promoting a deep understanding of molecular packing and charge transport for conjugated polymers.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed Biomimetic Systems with Synergetic Color and Shape Responses Based on Oblate Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Droplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D&#8208;printed biomimetic systems with synergetic color and shape responses based on oblate cholesteric liquid crystal droplets are developed. The structural colored biomimetic systems possess a lot of unique properties, such as tunable color, reversible shape change, easy processing, and flexible patterning, making them applicable in various scenarios.








Abstract
Living organisms in nature have amazing control over their color, shape, and morphology in response to environmental stimuli for camouflage, communication, or reproduction. Inspired by the camouflage of the octopus via the elongation or contraction of its pigment cells, oblate cholesteric liquid crystal droplets are dispersed in a polymer matrix, serving as the role of pigment cells and showing structural color due to selective Bragg reflection by their periodic helical structure. The color of 3D&#8208;printed biomimetic systems can be tuned by changing the helical pitch via the chiral dopant concentration or temperature. When the oblate liquid crystal droplets are heated up to isotropic, the opaque and colored biomimetic systems become transparent and colorless. Meanwhile, the isotropic liquid crystal droplets tend to become spherical, causing volume contraction along the film plane and volume dilation in the perpendicular direction. The internal strain combined with the gradient distribution of the oblate isotropic liquid crystal droplets result in corresponding shape transformations. The camouflage of a biomimetic octopus and the blossom of a biomimetic flower, both of which show synergetic color and shape responses, are demonstrated to inspire the design of functional materials and intelligent devices.

         <title>Intermediate&#8208;Adduct&#8208;Assisted Growth of Stable CsPbI2Br Inorganic Perovskite Films for High&#8208;Efficiency Semitransparent Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inorganic perovskite CsPbI2Br is applied to prepare high&#8208;performance semitransparent perovskite solar cells (ST&#8208;PSCs). (Chloromethylene)&#8208;dimethylammonium chloride as an additive is introduced into the perovskite precursor to favor high&#8208;quality CsPbI2Br perovskite films. Through optimizing the perovskite film, interface, and electrode type, the efficiency of the ST&#8208;PSC reaches 14.01% and 10.36% under an average visible transmittance (AVT) of 31.7% and 40.9%, respectively.








Abstract
Thanks to the tunable bandgap and excellent photoelectric characteristics, perovskites have been widely used in semitransparent solar cells (ST&#8208;SCs). Most works present unsatisfactory power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) through reducing the thickness of the perovskite films because there is a trade&#8208;off between PCE and average visible transmittance (AVT). As a consequence, most PCEs are less than 12% when the AVT is higher than 20% due to the limited voltage (Voc) and short&#8208;circuit current (Jsc). Herein, a strategy of intermediate adduct (IMAT) engineering is developed to improve the film quality of the inorganic perovskite CsPbI2Br, which is a challenging issue to limit its performance of efficiency and stability. A normal n&#8211;i&#8211;p&#8208;structured PSC based on the optimal CsPbI2Br film delivers a PCE of 16.02% with excellent stability. Furthermore, through optimizing the electrode type and interface, the ST&#8208;PSC shows a high Voc larger than 1.2&#160;V and the PCE reaches 14.01% and 10.36% under an AVT of 31.7% and 40.9%, respectively. This is the first demonstration of a CsPbI2Br ST&#8208;PSC, and it outperforms most of other types of perovskites.

         <title>Colossal Magnetoresistance without Mixed Valence in a Layered Phosphide Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A change of paradigm in a technologically important phenomenon, the colossal magnetoresistance (CMR), is introduced. Previously, it was believed that the CMR required ferromagnetic ordering and a structural distortion. EuCd2P2 has antiferromagnetic ordering and does not have a structural distortion or mixed valence, yet it exhibits the largest CMR known in a single crystal.








Abstract
Materials with strong magnetoresistive responses are the backbone of spintronic technology, magnetic sensors, and hard drives. Among them, manganese oxides with a mixed valence and a cubic perovskite structure stand out due to their colossal magnetoresistance (CMR). A double exchange interaction underlies the CMR in manganates, whereby charge transport is enhanced when the spins on neighboring Mn3+ and Mn4+ ions are parallel. Prior efforts to find different materials or mechanisms for CMR resulted in a much smaller effect. Here an enormous CMR at low temperatures in EuCd2P2 without manganese, oxygen, mixed valence, or cubic perovskite structure is shown. EuCd2P2 has a layered trigonal lattice and exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering at 11 K. The magnitude of CMR (104%) in as&#8208;grown crystals of EuCd2P2 rivals the magnitude in optimized thin films of manganates. The magnetization, transport, and synchrotron X&#8208;ray data suggest that strong magnetic fluctuations are responsible for this phenomenon. The realization of CMR at low temperatures without heterovalency leads to a new regime for materials and technologies related to antiferromagnetic spintronics.

         <title>Multitasking MXene Inks Enable High&#8208;Performance Printable Microelectrochemical Energy Storage Devices for All&#8208;Flexible Self&#8208;Powered Integrated Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;flexible MXene&#8208;based self&#8208;powered electronic system is demonstrated on a single substrate through seamless integration of a tandem solar cell, MXene&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion microbatteries or micro&#8208;supercapacitors, and an MXene hydrogel pressure sensor, where the multitasking MXene is fully exploited as a high&#8208;capacitance electrode, a sensitive pressure&#8208;sensing material, a highly conducting current collector, a metal&#8208;free interconnector, and a conductive binder.








Abstract
The future of mankind holds great promise for things like the Internet of Things, personal health monitoring systems, and smart cities. To achieve this ambitious goal, it is imperative for electronics to be wearable, environmentally sustainable, and safe. However, large&#8208;scale manufacture of self&#8208;sufficient electronic systems by exploiting multifunctional materials still faces significant hurdles. Herein, multitasking aqueous printable MXene inks are reported as an additive&#8208;free high&#8208;capacitance electrode, sensitive pressure&#8208;sensing material, highly conducting current collector, metal&#8208;free interconnector, and conductive binder. By directly screen printing MXene inks, MXene&#8208;based micro&#8208;supercapacitors (MSCs) and lithium&#8208;ion microbatteries (LIMBs) are delicately fabricated on various substrates. The as&#8208;prepared MSCs exhibit ultrahigh areal capacitance of 1.1 F cm&#8722;2 and the serially connected MSCs offer a record voltage of 60&#160;V. The quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state LIMBs deliver a robust areal energy density of 154&#160;&#956;Wh&#160;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, an all&#8208;flexible self&#8208;powered integrated system on a single substrate based on the multitasking MXene inks is demonstrated through seamless integration of a tandem solar cell, the LIMB, and an MXene hydrogel pressure sensor. Notably, this integrated system is exceptionally sensitive to body movements with a fast response time of 35&#160;ms. Therefore, this multipurpose MXene ink opens a new avenue for powering future smart appliances.

         <title>Ductile Ag20S7Te3 with Excellent Shape&#8208;Conformability and High Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new ductile inorganic thermoelectric (TE) material, Ag20S7Te3, with high carrier mobility, low lattice thermal conductivity, and a maximum zT of 0.80 at 600 K is reported. The prototype hetero&#8208;shaped TE generator consisting of 10 Ag20S7Te3 strips displays an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 69.2&#160;mV and a maximum power output of 17.1 &#956;W under a temperature difference of 70 K.








Abstract
Hetero&#8208;shaped thermoelectric (TE) generators (TEGs) can power the sensors used in safety monitoring systems of undersea oil pipelines, but their development is greatly limited by the lack of materials with both good shape&#8208;conformable ability and high TE performance. In this work, a new ductile inorganic TE material, Ag20S7Te3, with high TE performance is reported. At 300&#8211;600 K, Ag20S7Te3 crystallizes in a body&#8208;centered cubic structure, in which S and Te atoms randomly occupy the (0, 0, 1) site. Due to the smaller generalized stacking fault energy in the (101&#175;)[010] slip system, Ag20S7Te3 shows better ductility than Ag2S, yielding excellent shape&#8208;conformability. The high carrier mobility and low lattice thermal conductivity observed in Ag20S7Te3 result in a maximum dimensionless figure of merit (zT) of 0.80 at 600 K, which is comparable with the best commercial Bi2Te3&#8208;based alloys. The prototype TEG consisting of 10 Ag20S7Te3 strips displays an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 69.2&#160;mV and a maximum power output of 17.1 &#181;W under the temperature difference of 70 K. This study creates a new route toward hetero&#8208;shaped TEG.

         <title>Optical Microfluidic Waveguides and Solution Lasers of Colloidal Semiconductor Quantum Wells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solution of semiconductor quantum wells (CQWs) colloidally synthesized and used as the gain medium in a capillary microfluidic waveguide yields record low optical gain threshold in solution. A Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity is created between the metallized sidewalls of the ends of the microfluidic channel and optically pumped along the side of the waveguide to generate a single&#8208;mode output laser beam.








Abstract
The realization of high&#8208;quality lasers in microfluidic devices is crucial for numerous applications, including biological and chemical sensors and flow cytometry, and the development of advanced lab&#8208;on&#8208;chip (LOC) devices. Herein, an ultralow&#8208;threshold microfluidic single&#8208;mode laser is proposed and demonstrated using an on&#8208;chip cavity. CdSe/CdS@CdxZn1&#8722;xS core/crown@gradient&#8208;alloyed shell colloidal semiconductor quantum wells (CQWs) dispersed in toluene are employed in the cavity created inside a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) microfluidic device using SiO2&#8208;protected Ag mirrors to achieve in&#8208;solution lasing. Lasing from such a microfluidic device having CQWs solution as a microfluidic gain medium is shown for the first time with a record&#8208;low optical gain threshold of 17.1 &#181;J cm&#8722;&#178; and lasing threshold of 68.4 &#181;J cm&#8722;&#178; among all solution&#8208;based lasing demonstrations. In addition, air&#8208;stable SiO2 protected Ag films are used and designed to form highly tunable and reflective mirrors required to attain a high&#8208;quality Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity. These realized record&#8208;low thresholds emanate from the high&#8208;quality on&#8208;chip cavity together with the core/crown@gradient&#8208;alloyed shell CQWs having giant gain cross&#8208;section and slow Auger rates. This microfabricated CQW laser provides a compact and inexpensive coherent light source for microfluidics and integrated optics covering the visible spectral region.

         <title>A Biodegradable Secondary Battery and its Biodegradation Mechanism for Eco&#8208;Friendly Energy&#8208;Storage Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The environmental issues caused by the disposal of an increasing amount of used batteries have become a great challenge. A material and design strategy for a fully biodegradable rechargeable battery to address this concern is reported. A novel material&#8208;selection guideline and design rule provide a viable demonstration of a non&#8208;toxic and eco&#8208;friendly battery, which decomposes via hydrolysis and/or fungal degradation.








Abstract
The production of rechargeable batteries is rapidly expanding, and there are going to be new challenges in the near future about how the potential environmental impact caused by the disposal of the large volume of the used batteries can be minimized. Herein, a novel strategy is proposed to address these concerns by applying biodegradable device technology. An eco&#8208;friendly and biodegradable sodium&#8208;ion secondary battery (SIB) is developed through extensive material screening followed by the synthesis of biodegradable electrodes and their seamless assembly with an unconventional biodegradable separator, electrolyte, and package. Each battery component decomposes in nature into non&#8208;toxic compounds or elements via hydrolysis and/or fungal degradation, with all of the biodegradation products naturally abundant and eco&#8208;friendly. Detailed biodegradation mechanisms and toxicity influence of each component on living organisms are determined. In addition, this new SIB delivers performance comparable to that of conventional non&#8208;degradable SIBs. The strategy and findings suggest a novel eco&#8208;friendly biodegradable paradigm for large&#8208;scale rechargeable battery systems.

         <title>Experimental Demonstration of Dual&#8208;Band Nano&#8208;Electromechanical Valley&#8208;Hall Topological Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of valley&#8208;Hall topological metamaterial is experimentally demonstrated on an integrated nano&#8208;electromechanical platform. Backscattering&#8208;immune transport and valley&#8208;momentum locking effect are experimentally observed in the fundamental (&#8776;60 MHz) and second&#8208;order (&#8776;120 MHz) frequency bands. These nano&#8208;electromechanical metamaterials enable very&#8208;high&#8208;frequency integrated phononic circuits with enhanced robustness and open the door to experimental exploration of nonlinear topological mechanics at the nanoscale.








Abstract
Suppression of undesired backscattering of very&#8208;high&#8208;frequency elastic signals has been considered as a grand challenge in integrated phononic circuits. Originating from condensed&#8208;matter physics, valley&#8208;Hall topological insulators provide an intriguing strategy to overcome this challenge. To date, phononic valley&#8208;Hall topological insulators have been demonstrated only in bulk acoustic and mechanical systems operating at relatively low frequencies. Here, an integrated nano&#8208;electromechanical valley&#8208;Hall topological insulator operating in the very&#8208;high&#8208;frequency regime is experimentally realized. Valley kink states that are backscattering&#8208;immune against sharp bends and exhibit the &#8220;valley&#8208;momentum locking&#8221; effect simultaneously in the fundamental (&#8776;60&#160;MHz) and second&#8208;order (&#8776;120&#160;MHz) frequency bands are demonstrated. It is further shown that the propagation directions of these dual&#8208;band valley kink states are always locked to their valley pseudospins. The results not only enable various applications in very&#8208;high&#8208;frequency integrated phononic circuits with enhanced robustness and capacity, but also open the door to experimental exploration of mechanical nonlinearities, particularly those involving the fundamental and second&#8208;order frequencies, in topologically nontrivial nanostructures.

         <title>Electron Density&#8208;Change in Semiconductor by Ion&#8208;Adsorption at Solid&#8211;Liquid Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;immersed Hall measurements are proposed to find direct evidence of ion&#8208;adsorption at the solid&#8211;liquid interface. Electron density&#8208;change by diffusion&#8208;driven ion dynamics occurs in a fully liquid&#8208;submerged device designed to monitor ion&#8208;specific dynamics in aqueous bulk phases. The ion&#8208;concentration gradient and diffusion coefficient of mobile ions are correlated with ion&#8208;adsorption rate, causing electric signal variations in the semiconductor.








Abstract
The change in electrical properties of electrodes by adsorption or desorption at interfaces is a well&#8208;known phenomenon required for signal production in electrically transduced sensing technologies. Furthermore, in terms of electrolyte&#8211;insulator&#8211;semiconductor (EIS) structure, several studies of energy conversion techniques focused on ion&#8208;adsorption at the solid&#8211;liquid interface have suggested that the electric signal is generated by ionovoltaic phenomena. However, finding substantial clues for the ion&#8208;adsorption phenomena in the EIS structure is still a difficult task because direct evidence for carrier accumulation in semiconductors by Coulomb interactions is insufficient. Here, a sophisticated Hall measurement system is demonstrated to quantitatively analyze accumulated electron density&#8208;change inside the semiconductor depending on the ion&#8208;adsorption at the solid&#8211;liquid interface. Also, an enhanced EIS&#8208;structured device is designed in an aqueous&#8208;soaked system that works with the ionovoltaic principle to monitor the ion&#8208;dynamics in liquid electrolyte media, interestingly confirming ion&#8208;concentration dependence and ion&#8208;specificity by generated peak voltages. This newly introduced peculiar method contributes to an in&#8208;depth understanding of the ionovoltaic phenomena in terms of carrier actions in the semiconductors and ionic behaviors in the aqueous&#8208;bulk phases, providing informative analysis about interfacial adsorptions that can expand the scope of ion&#8208;sensing platforms.

         <title>Deep Cycling for High&#8208;Capacity Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various electrochemical energy storage devices use movable ions in either the electrolyte or the electrodes for energy storage. A deep&#8208;cycling Li&#8208;ion battery that uses movable ions in both the electrolyte and the electrodes is developed, which offers opportunities to break the capacity limit of conventional rocking&#8208;chair Li&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
As the practical capacity of conventional Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) approaches the theoretical limit, which is determined by the rocking&#8208;chair cycling architecture, a new cycling architecture with higher capacity is highly demanded for future development and electronic applications. Here, a deep&#8208;cycling architecture intrinsically with a higher theoretical capacity limit than conventional rocking&#8208;chair cycling architecture is developed, by introducing a follow&#8208;up cycling process to contribute more capacity. The deep&#8208;cycling architecture makes full use of movable ions in both of the electrolyte and electrodes for energy storage, rather than in either the electrolyte or the electrodes. Taking LiMn2O4&#8208;mesocarbon microbeads (MCMB)/Li cells as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, 57.7% more capacity is obtained. Moreover, the capacity retention is as high as 84.4% after 2000 charging/discharging cycles. The deep&#8208;cycling architecture offers opportunities to break the theoretical capacity limit of conventional LIBs and makes high demands for new&#8208;type of cathode materials, which will promote the development of next&#8208;generation energy storage devices.

         <title>Fully Light&#8208;Controlled Memory and Neuromorphic Computation in Layered Black Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;optically tunable neuromorphic imaging element based on black phosphorus (BP) is demonstrated. The unusual wavelength&#8208;dependent photocurrent in BP is harnessed to optically program and erase visual memory elements. Concurrently, the same elements are capable of in&#8208;pixel image pre&#8208;processing in an array and optoelectronic machine learning for image recognition through artificial neural networks.








Abstract
Imprinting vision as memory is a core attribute of human cognitive learning. Fundamental to artificial intelligence systems are bioinspired neuromorphic vision components for the visible and invisible segments of the electromagnetic spectrum. Realization of a single imaging unit with a combination of in&#8208;built memory and signal processing capability is imperative to deploy efficient brain&#8208;like vision systems. However, the lack of a platform that can be fully controlled by light without the need to apply alternating polarity electric signals has hampered this technological advance. Here, a neuromorphic imaging element based on a fully light&#8208;modulated 2D semiconductor in a simple reconfigurable phototransistor structure is presented. This standalone device exhibits inherent characteristics that enable neuromorphic image pre&#8208;processing and recognition. Fundamentally, the unique photoresponse induced by oxidation&#8208;related defects in 2D black phosphorus (BP) is exploited to achieve visual memory, wavelength&#8208;selective multibit programming, and erasing functions, which allow in&#8208;pixel image pre&#8208;processing. Furthermore, all&#8208;optically driven neuromorphic computation is demonstrated by machine learning to classify numbers and recognize images with an accuracy of over 90%. The devices provide a promising approach toward neurorobotics, human&#8211;machine interaction technologies, and scalable bionic systems with visual data storage/buffering and processing.

         <title>Exfoliation of Alpha&#8208;Germanium: A Covalent Diamond&#8208;Like Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Germanium crystals are exfoliated using a wet ball&#8208;milling technique to produce &#945;&#8208;germanium nanolayers (&#945;&#8208;Ge NLs) in a process that is upscaled to gram production. The &#945;&#8208;Ge NLs can be redispersed using a shear&#8208;mixer, yielding very stable suspensions. Theoretical calculations predict a thickness&#8208;dependent bandgap of these NLs that is confirmed by electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy of &#945;&#8208;Ge NLs with different orientations.








Abstract
2D materials have opened a new field in materials science with outstanding scientific and technological impact. A largely explored route for the preparation of 2D materials is the exfoliation of layered crystals with weak forces between their layers. However, its application to covalent crystals remains elusive. Herein, a further step is taken by introducing the exfoliation of germanium, a narrow&#8208;bandgap semiconductor presenting a 3D diamond&#8208;like structure with strong covalent bonds. Pure &#945;&#8208;germanium is exfoliated following a simple one&#8208;step procedure assisted by wet ball&#8208;milling, allowing gram&#8208;scale fabrication of high&#8208;quality layers with large lateral dimensions and nanometer thicknesses. The generated flakes are thoroughly characterized by different techniques, giving evidence that the new 2D material exhibits bandgaps that depend on both the crystallographic direction and the number of layers. Besides potential technological applications, this work is also of interest for the search of 2D materials with new properties.

         <title>Tensegrity Metamaterials: Toward Failure&#8208;Resistant Engineering Systems through Delocalized Deformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Failure of materials and structures is typically preceded by a catastrophic chain reaction of locally confined damage events, while large parts of the system do not experience critical loads. Breaking with this established paradigm, this study introduces the concept of delocalized deformation, enabling failure&#8208;resistant structures and materials via 3D tensegrity metamaterials.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;Failure of materials and structures is typically preceded by a catastrophic chain reaction of locally confined damage events, while large parts of the system do not experience critical loads. Breaking with this established paradigm, this study introduces the concept of delocalized deformation, enabling failure&#8208;resistant structures and materials via 3D tensegrity metamaterials.

         <title>Heterogeneous Hydrogel Structures with Spatiotemporal Reconfigurability using Addressable and Tunable Voxels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Creating hyper&#8208;redundant miniaturized soft robots with multiple active degrees of freedom is challenging. Using building blocks called soft voxel actuators (SVAs) in a muscle&#8208;inspire bottom&#8208;up manufacturing strategy, hyper&#8208;redundant soft robots are created, demonstrating spatiotemporal reconfigurability and thus ability to work in unstructured environments. A facile mixed&#8208;solvent photopolymerization developed for poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) hydrogels supports the mass production of SVAs.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels can sense environmental cues and change their volume accordingly without the need for additional sensors or actuators. This enables a significant reduction in the size and complexity of resulting devices. However, since the responsive volume change of hydrogels is typically uniform, their robotic applications requiring localized and time&#8208;varying deformations have been challenging to realize. Here, using addressable and tunable hydrogel building blocks&#8212;referred to as soft voxel actuators (SVAs)&#8212;heterogeneous hydrogel structures with programmable spatiotemporal deformations are presented. SVAs are produced using a mixed&#8208;solvent photopolymerization method, utilizing a fast reaction speed and the cononsolvency property of poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) to produce highly interconnected hydrogel pore structures, resulting in tunable swelling ratio, swelling rate, and Young's modulus in a simple, one&#8208;step casting process that is compatible with mass production of SVA units. By designing the location and swelling properties of each voxel and by activating embedded Joule heaters in the voxels, spatiotemporal deformations are achieved, which enables heterogeneous hydrogel structures to manipulate objects, avoid obstacles, generate traveling waves, and morph to different shapes. Together, these innovations pave the way toward tunable, untethered, and high&#8208;degree&#8208;of&#8208;freedom hydrogel robots that can adapt and respond to changing conditions in unstructured&#160;environments.

         <title>2D Copper Tetrahydroxyquinone Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Selective CO2 Electrocatalysis at Low Overpotentials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic performance of a 2D copper tetrahydroxyquinone conductive metal&#8211;organic framework (c&#8208;MOF) is studied in the CO2 reduction reaction. In the low overpotential range, the c&#8208;MOF catalyst delivers record values of turn&#8208;over number for CO formation and a negligible overpotential for the CO2 reduction reaction. These findings open a new path for further advances in core electrochemical reactions.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials for electrocatalysis; however, lack of electrical conductivity in the majority of existing MOFs limits their effective utilization in the field. Herein, an excellent catalytic activity of a 2D copper (Cu)&#8208;based conductive MOF, copper tetrahydroxyquinone (Cu&#63743;THQ), is reported for aqueous CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) at low overpotentials. It is revealed that Cu&#63743;THQ nanoflakes (NFs) with an average lateral size of 140&#160;nm exhibit a negligible overpotential of 16&#160;mV for the activation of this reaction, a high current density of &#8776;173&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.45&#160;V versus RHE, an average Faradaic efficiency (F.E.) of &#8776;91% toward CO production, and a remarkable turnover frequency as high as &#8776;20.82 s&#8722;1. In the low overpotential range, the obtained CO formation current density is more than 35 and 25 times higher compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MOF and MOF&#8208;derived catalysts, respectively. The operando Cu K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption near edge spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal the existence of reduced Cu (Cu+) during CO2RR which reversibly returns to Cu2+ after the reaction. The outstanding CO2 catalytic functionality of conductive MOFs (c&#8208;MOFs) can open a way toward high&#8208;energy&#8208;density electrochemical systems.

An ultralow&#8208;threshold microfluidic single&#8208;mode laser is demonstrated by Emine Yegan Erdem, Hilmi Volkan Demir, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2007131, who use an on&#8208;chip cavity that has a colloidal quantum well solution as a microfluidic gain medium, which shows a record&#8208;low threshold among all solution&#8208;based lasers of 68 &#956;J cm&#8722;2. This work presents a significant step toward the realization of practical solution&#8208;based lasers from colloidal nanocrystals integrated into microfluidic devices designed for sensing and imaging applications.

&lt;p&gt;An ultralow&#8208;threshold microfluidic single&#8208;mode laser is demonstrated by Emine Yegan Erdem, Hilmi Volkan Demir, and co&#8208;workers in article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202007131"&gt;2007131&lt;/a&gt;, who use an on&#8208;chip cavity that has a colloidal quantum well solution as a microfluidic gain medium, which shows a record&#8208;low threshold among all solution&#8208;based lasers of 68 &#956;J cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This work presents a significant step toward the realization of practical solution&#8208;based lasers from colloidal nanocrystals integrated into microfluidic devices designed for sensing and imaging applications.

In article number 2003845, Wei Ai, Hongfang Du, Wei Huang, and co&#8208;workers systematically review the progress of Sebased cathodes in Li batteries, in particular paying attention to their electrolyte&#8208;dependent principle and performance. Li&#8211;Se batteries remain appealing and have gained burgeoning interests in recent years, which originates from their superior volumetric energy densities, and they are a prospective candidate to fulfil the energy&#8208;storage application requirement of a limited packing space, such as for electric vehicles.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;optically tunable neuromorphic imaging element based on black phosphorus (BP) is demonstrated by Taimur Ahmed, Sumeet Walia, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2004207. The unusual wavelength&#8208;dependent photocurrent in BP is harnessed to optically program and erase visual memory elements. Concurrently, the same elements are capable of in&#8208;pixel image preprocessing in an imaging array and optoelectronic machine learning for pattern classification and image recognition through deploying artificial neural networks.

In article number 2007239, Byung Jin Cho, Jae&#8208;Woong Jeong, and co&#8208;workers present a design strategy for transformative electronics capable of rapid bidirectional stiffness tuning. Transformative electronics are built on a gallium platform interfaced with graphene and a flexible thermoelectric device (f&#8208;TED). The graphene works as a catalyst to mitigate the supercooling phenomenon in the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition of gallium, and the f&#8208;TED offers active temperature control to help accelerate the rigid&#8211;soft transformation of the overall system.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Failure of materials and structures is the inevitable consequence of a catastrophic chain reaction of locally confined damage events. Breaking with this paradigm, in article number 2005647, Julian J. Rimoli, Lorenzo Valdevit, and co&#8208;workers introduce a novel class of tensegrity metamaterials. By connecting isolated loops of compressive elements through a continuous tension network, these metamaterials delocalize deformation, demonstrating a pathway toward superior failure&#8208;resistant engineering systems.

Assembly of small&#8208;scale soft robots using hydrogelbased soft voxel actuators (SVAs) facilitates the actuation of complex and hyper&#8208;redundant motion. In article number 2005906, Ximin He, Daniel M. Aukes, and co&#8208;workers report the electrical activation of SVAs, which resembles the activation of muscle tissue via electrical impulses in the nervous system, as in soft&#8208;bodied animals such as the octopus. Rendering by Cole Brauer.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Level Charge Separation Strategies in Semiconductor&#8208;Based Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconductor photocatalytic efficiency greatly relies on effective charge separation. The recent progress of atomic&#8208;level strategies for promoting charge separation and migration in the bulk, on the surface, and both bulk and surface of a photocatalyst are highlighted and a guideline for the bottom&#8208;up design of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts suggested.








Abstract
Semiconductor&#8208;based photocatalysis as a productive technology furnishes a prospective solution to environmental and renewable energy issues, but its efficiency greatly relies&#160;on the effective bulk and surface separation of photoexcited charge carriers. Exploitation of atomic&#8208;level strategies allows in&#8208;depth understanding on the related mechanisms and enables bottom&#8208;up precise design of photocatalysts, significantly enhancing photocatalytic activity. Herein, the advances on atomic&#8208;level charge separation strategies toward developing robust photocatalysts are highlighted, elucidating the fundamentals of charge separation and transfer processes and advanced probing techniques. The atomic&#8208;level bulk charge separation strategies, embodied by regulation of charge movement pathway and migration dynamic, boil&#160;down&#160;to shortening the charge diffusion distance to the atomic&#8208;scale, establishing atomic&#8208;level charge transfer channels, and enhancing the charge separation driving force. Meanwhile, regulating the in&#8208;plane surface structure and spatial surface structure are summarized as atomic&#8208;level surface charge separation strategies. Moreover, collaborative strategies for simultaneous manipulation of bulk and surface photocharges are also introduced. Finally, the existing challenges and future prospects for fabrication of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysts are discussed on the basis of a thorough comprehension of atomic&#8208;level charge separation strategies.

         <title>State&#8208;Of&#8208;The&#8208;Art and Future Challenges in High Energy Lithium&#8211;Selenium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li&#8211;Se batteries (LSeBs) have garnered intensive attention since the Se cathode possesses high capacity and electronic conductivity. LSeBs experience a solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transformation accompanied by side reactions in carbonate electrolytes but multiphase conversion in ether&#8208;based ones. The advances for cathode design, blocking layer engineering, and emerging solid&#8208;state electrolytes are summarized. The future research directions are also outlined to motivate further insightful work.








Abstract
Li&#8208;chalcogen batteries, especially the Li&#8211;S batteries (LSBs), have received paramount interests as next generation energy storage techniques because of their high theoretical energy densities. However, the associated challenges need to be overcome prior to their commercialization. Elemental selenium, another chalcogen member, would be an attractive alternative to sulfur owing to its higher electronic conductivity, comparable capacity density, and moreover, excellent compatibility with carbonate electrolytes. Unlike LSBs, the research and development of Li&#8211;Se batteries (LSeBs) have garnered burgeoning attention but are still in their infant stage, where a comprehensive yet in&#8208;depth overview is highly imperative to guide future research. Herein, a critical review of LSeBs, in terms of the underlying mechanisms, cathode design, blocking layer engineering, and emerging solid&#8208;state electrolytes is provided. First, the electrolyte&#8208;dependent electrochemistry of LSeBs is discussed. Second, the advances in Se&#8208;based cathodes are comprehensively summarized, especially highlighting the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art SexSy cathodes, and mainly focusing on their structures, compositions, and synthetic strategies. Third, the versatile separators/interlayers optimization and interface regulation are outlined, with a particular focus on the emerging solid&#8208;state electrolytes for advanced LSeBs. Last, the remaining challenges and research orientations in this booming field are proposed, which are expected to motivate more insightful works.

         <title>Giant and Reversible Barocaloric Effect in Trinuclear Spin&#8208;Crossover Complex Fe3(bntrz)6(tcnset)6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A giant and robust barocaloric effect is demonstrated in a trinuclear Fe(II) complex that exhibits an abrupt spin&#8208;state transition with a negligible hysteresis. The pressure&#8208;dependent transition spans temperatures between 318 K at ambient pressure and 383 K at 2.6 kbar. The reversible entropy and temperature changes observed are among the highest reported for any caloric material thus far.








Abstract
A giant barocaloric effect (BCE) in a molecular material Fe3(bntrz)6(tcnset)6 (FBT) is reported, where bntrz = 4&#8208;(benzyl)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole and tcnset = 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetracyano&#8208;2&#8208;thioethylepropenide. The crystal structure of FBT contains a trinuclear transition metal complex that undergoes an abrupt spin&#8208;state switching between the state in which all three FeII centers are in the high&#8208;spin (S&#160;= 2) electronic configuration and the state in which all of them are in the low&#8208;spin (S&#160;= 0) configuration. Despite the strongly cooperative nature of the spin transition, it proceeds with a negligible hysteresis and a large volumetric change, suggesting that FBT should be a good candidate for producing a large BCE. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and calorimetry reveal that the material is highly susceptible to applied pressure, as the transition temperature spans the range from 318 at ambient pressure to 383 K at 2.6 kbar. Despite the large shift in the spin&#8208;transition temperature, its nonhysteretic character is maintained under applied pressure. Such behavior leads to a remarkably large and reversible BCE, characterized by an isothermal entropy change of 120 J kg&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 and an adiabatic temperature change of 35 K, which are among the highest reversible values reported for any caloric material thus far.

         <title>High&#8208;Quality Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskite Film Formation for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskite film quality is a governing factor determining the performance of RP perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The RP film quality for fabricating high&#8208;performance RP perovskite&#8208;based PSCs is discussed. Evaluation index and influential factors of RP perovskite films are reviewed. Based on this, strategies to improve RP perovskite film quality are also proposed.








Abstract
In the last decade, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have undergone unprecedented rapid development and become a promising candidate for a new&#8208;generation solar cell. Among various PSCs, typical 3D halide perovskite&#8208;based PSCs deliver the highest efficiency but they suffer from severe instability, which restricts their practical applications. By contrast, the low&#8208;dimensional Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskite&#8208;based PSCs have recently raised increasing attention due to their superior stability. Yet, the efficiency of RP perovskite&#8208;based PSCs is still far from that of the 3D counterparts owing to the difficulty in fabricating high&#8208;quality RP perovskite films. In pursuit of high&#8208;efficiency RP perovskite&#8208;based PSCs, it is critical to manipulate the film formation process to prepare high&#8208;quality RP perovskite films. This review aims to provide comprehensive understanding of the high&#8208;quality RP&#8208;type perovskite film formation by investigating the influential factors. On this basis, several strategies to improve the RP perovskite film quality are proposed via summarizing the recent progress and efforts on the preparation of high&#8208;quality RP perovskite film. This review will provide useful guidelines for a better understanding of the crystallization and phase kinetics during RP perovskite film formation process and the design and development of high&#8208;performance RP perovskite&#8208;based PSCs, promoting the commercialization of PSC technology.

         <title>Hetero&#8208;MXenes: Theory, Synthesis, and Emerging Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive overview of hetero&#8208;MXenes, from theoretical predictions to experimental investigations, is presented. The reviewed theoretical calculations focus on three sites of MXenes and the reviewed metal&#8208;/nonmetal&#8208;doped/substituted MXenes are experimentally synthesized by in situ/ex situ strategies. It is believed that this work will be beneficial to bridge predictions and experiments, further promoting the development of hetero&#8208;MXenes.








Abstract
Since their discovery in 2011, MXenes (abbreviation for transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides) have emerged as a rising star in the family of 2D materials owing to their unique properties. Although the primary research interest is still focused on pristine MXenes and their composites, much attention has in recent years been paid also to MXenes with diverse compositions. To this end, this work offers a comprehensive overview of the progress on compositional engineering of MXenes in terms of doping and substituting from theoretical predictions to experimental investigations. Synthesis and properties are briefly introduced for pristine MXenes and then reviewed for hetero&#8208;MXenes. Theoretical calculations regarding the doping/substituting at M, X, and T sites in MXenes and the role of vacancies are summarized. After discussing the synthesis of hetero&#8208;MXenes with metal/nonmetal (N, S, P) elements by in situ and ex situ strategies, the focus turns to their emerging applications in various fields such as energy storage, electrocatalysts, and sensors. Finally, challenges and prospects of hetero&#8208;MXenes are addressed. It is anticipated that this review will be beneficial to bridge the gap between predictions and experiments as well as to guide the future design of hetero&#8208;MXenes with high performance.

         <title>Increased Efficiency of Current&#8208;Induced Motion of Chiral Domain Walls by Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficiency of current&#8208;induced domain wall motion in both ferromagnetic/heavy metal and synthetic antiferromagnet systems is significantly enhanced via the insertion of atomically thin dusting layers at the ferromagnet/heavy metal interface. The enhancement is due to the tuning of the strength of the Dzyaloshiskii&#8211;Moriya interaction and the effective magnetic uniaxial anisotropy energy.








Abstract
Magnetic racetrack devices are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation memories. These spintronic shift&#8208;register devices are formed from perpendicularly magnetized ferromagnet/heavy metal thin&#8208;film systems. Data are encoded in domain wall magnetic bits that have a chiral N&#233;el structure that is stabilized by an interfacial Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction. The bits are manipulated by spin currents generated from electrical currents that are passed through the heavy metal layers. Increased efficiency of the current&#8208;induced domain wall motion is a prerequisite for commercially viable racetrack devices. Here, significantly increased efficiency with substantially lower threshold current densities and enhanced domain wall velocities is demonstrated by the introduction of atomically thin 4d and 5d metal &#8220;dusting&#8221; layers at the interface between the lower magnetic layer of the racetrack (here cobalt) and platinum. The greatest efficiency is found for dusting layers of palladium and rhodium, just one monolayer thick, for which the domain wall's velocity is increased by up to a factor of 3.5. Remarkably, when the heavy metal layer is formed from the dusting layer material alone, the efficiency is rather reduced by an order of magnitude. The results point to the critical role of interface engineering for the development of efficient racetrack memory devices.

         <title>Scalable Assembly of Flexible Ultrathin All&#8208;in&#8208;One Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries with Highly Stretchable, Editable, and Customizable Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large&#8208;scale assembly strategy of flexible zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) with an ultrathin all&#8208;in&#8208;one structure is developed. Such a unique all&#8208;in&#8208;one structure endows the ZIBs with high flexibility and electrochemical performance as well as the ability to be tailored and edited into desired shapes and structures. Furthermore, they can be integrated with solar cells into an energy harvesting and storage integrated system.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are considered to be a promising candidate for flexible energy storage devices due to their high safety and low cost. However, the scalable assembly of flexible ZIBs is still a challenge. Here, a scalable assembly strategy is developed to fabricate flexible ZIBs with an ultrathin all&#8208;in&#8208;one structure by combining blade coating with a rolling assembly process. Such a unique all&#8208;in&#8208;one integrated structure can effectively avoid the relative displacement or detachment between neighboring components to ensure continuous and effective ion&#8208; and/or loading&#8208;transfer capacity under external deformation, resulting in excellent structural and electrochemical stability. Furthermore, the ultrathin all&#8208;in&#8208;one ZIBs can be tailored and edited controllably into desired shapes and structures, further extending their editable, stretchable, and shape&#8208;customized functions. In addition, the ultrathin all&#8208;in&#8208;one ZIBs display the ability to integrate with perovskite solar cells to achieve an energy harvesting and storage integrated system. These enlighten a broad area of flexible ZIBs to be compatible with highly flexible and wearable electronics. The scaling&#8208;up assembly strategy provides a route to design other ultrathin all&#8208;in&#8208;one energy storage devices with stretchable, editable, and customizable behaviors.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Engineering Induced Anisotropic Crystallite Orientation and Maximized Carrier Mobility for High&#8208;Performance Microfiber&#8208;Based Organic Bioelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 10, March 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance microfiber&#8208;based organic electrochemical transistors are reported, which display unprecedentedly large figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit (&#956;C*&#160;&#8776;1500&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1) using highly ordered crystalline PEDOT:PSS microfibers with enhanced carrier mobility (12.9&#160;cm2 V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1) without the trade&#8208;off in volumetric capacitance (122&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;3) owing to the highly anisotropic crystallite domain ordering along the fiber direction via uniaxial strain engineering in combination with solvent&#8208;mediated crystallization.








Abstract
Despite the importance of carrier mobility, recent research efforts have been mainly focused on the improvement of volumetric capacitance in order to maximize the figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit, &#956;C* (product of carrier mobility and volumetric capacitance), for high&#8208;performance organic electrochemical transistors. Herein, high&#8208;performance microfiber&#8208;based organic electrochemical transistors with unprecedentedly large &#956;C* using highly ordered crystalline poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) microfibers with very high carrier mobilities are reported. The strain engineering via uniaxial tension is employed in combination with solvent&#8208;mediated crystallization in the course of drying coagulated fibers, resulting in the permanent preferential alignment of crystalline PEDOT:PSS domains along the fiber direction, which is verified by atomic force microscopy and transmission wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering. The resultant strain&#8208;engineered microfibers exhibit very high carrier mobility (12.9 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) without the trade&#8208;off in volumetric capacitance (122&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;3) and hole density (5.8&#160;&#215;&#160;1020&#160;cm&#8722;3). Such advantageous electrical and electrochemical characteristics offer the benchmark parameter of &#956;C* over &#8776;1500&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, which is the highest metric ever reported in the literature and can be beneficial for realizing a new class of substrate&#8208;free fibrillar and/or textile bioelectronics in the configuration of electrochemical transistors and/or electrochemical ion pumps.

         <title>Recent Advances in Silicon&#8208;Based Electrodes: From Fundamental Research toward Practical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The major challenges, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments on rational structure design strategies, surface/interface engineering, industrial anode/cathode selection, and advanced in situ/operando characterizations toward deep understanding of the working mechanism of Si&#8208;based electrodes are reviewed. It is demonstrated that Si&#8208;based anodes are promising candidates in configurations of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, Li&#8211;S batteries, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, and beyond.








Abstract
The increasing demand for higher&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries driven by advancements in electric vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles, and portable electronic devices necessitates the development of alternative anode materials with a specific capacity beyond that of traditional graphite anodes. Here, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments made in the rational design of Si&#8208;based electrodes and their progression toward practical application are presented. First, a comprehensive overview of fundamental electrochemistry and selected critical challenges is given, including their large volume expansion, unstable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) growth, low initial Coulombic efficiency, low areal capacity, and safety issues. Second, the principles of potential solutions including nanoarchitectured construction, surface/interface engineering, novel binder and electrolyte design, and designing the whole electrode for stability are discussed in detail. Third, applications for Si&#8208;based anodes beyond LIBs are highlighted, specifically noting their promise in configurations of Li&#8211;S batteries and all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. Fourth, the electrochemical reaction process, structural evolution, and degradation mechanisms are systematically investigated by advanced in situ and operando characterizations. Finally, the future trends and perspectives with an emphasis on commercialization of Si&#8208;based electrodes are provided. Si&#8208;based anode materials will be key in helping keep up with the demands for higher energy density in the coming decades.

         <title>Monotherapy and Combination Therapy Using Anti&#8208;Angiogenic Nanoagents to Fight Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview of monotherapy and combination therapy using anti&#8208;angiogenic agents for fighting cancer is presented. Traditional cancer anti&#8208;angiogenic monotherapy and its limitations are first summarized. Then anti&#8208;angiogenic nanoagents and how they can be used in combined strategies with chemo/radio/photo/immunotherapy are illustrated. This review can provide valuable instruction on anti&#8208;angiogenic and combined strategies to improve anti&#8208;tumor outcome.








Abstract
Anti&#8208;angiogenic therapy, targeting vascular endothelial cells (ECs) to prevent tumor growth, has been attracting increasing attention in recent years, beginning with bevacizumab (Avastin) through its Phase II/III clinical trials on solid tumors. However, these trials showed only modest clinical efficiency; moreover, anti&#8208;angiogenic therapy may induce acquired resistance to the drugs employed. Combining advanced drug delivery techniques (e.g., nanotechnology) or other therapeutic strategies (e.g., chemotherapy, radiotherapy, phototherapy, and immunotherapy) with anti&#8208;angiogenic therapy results in significantly synergistic effects and has opened a new horizon in fighting cancer. Herein, clinical difficulties in using traditional anti&#8208;angiogenic therapy are discussed. Then, several promising applications of anti&#8208;angiogenic nanoagents in monotherapies and combination therapies are highlighted. Finally, the challenges and perspectives of anti&#8208;angiogenic cancer therapy are summarized. A useful introduction to anti&#8208;angiogenic strategies, which may significantly improve therapeutic outcomes, is thus provided.

         <title>Flexible Noncontact Sensing for Human&#8211;Machine Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible noncontact sensing based on a high&#8208;sensitivity humidity sensor is realized by anchoring multilayer graphene (MG) into electrospun polyamide (PA) 66 for human&#8211;machine interaction systems, which can achieve not only asthma detection, via monitoring the respiration rate in real time, and remote alarm systems, but also touchless interfaces in medicine delivery for bedridden patients.








Abstract
From typical electrical appliances to thriving intelligent robots, the exchange of information between humans and machines has mainly relied on the contact sensor medium. However, this kind of contact interaction can cause severe problems, such as inevitable mechanical wear and cross&#8208;infection of bacteria or viruses between the users, especially during the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. Therefore, revolutionary noncontact human&#8211;machine interaction (HMI) is highly desired in remote online detection and noncontact control systems. In this study, a flexible high&#8208;sensitivity humidity sensor and array are presented, fabricated by anchoring multilayer graphene (MG) into electrospun polyamide (PA) 66. The sensor works in noncontact mode for asthma detection, via monitoring the respiration rate in real time, and remote alarm systems and provides touchless interfaces in medicine delivery for bedridden patients. The physical structure of the large specific surface area and the chemical structure of the abundant water&#8208;absorbing functional groups of the PA66 nanofiber networks contribute to the high performance synergistically. This work can lead to a new era of noncontact HMI without the risk of contagiousness and provide a general and effective strategy for the development of smart electronics that require noncontact interaction.

         <title>3D Printing of Transparent Spinel Ceramics with Transmittance Approaching the Theoretical Limit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnesium aluminate spinel transparent ceramics with transmittance reaching 97% of the theoretical limit are successfully 3D printed with a high printing resolution of &#8776;100&#8211;200&#160;&#181;m. Application of the printed ceramics for optical imaging and photocatalyst support is explored.








Abstract
3D printing of transparent ceramics has attracted great attention recently but faces the challenges of low transparency and low printing resolution. Herein, magnesium aluminate spinel transparent ceramics with transmittance reaching 97% of the theoretical limit are successfully fabricated using a stereolithography&#8208;based 3D printing method assisted by hot isostatic pressing and the critical factors governing the transparency are revealed. Various transparent spinel lenses and microlattices are printed at a high resolution of &#8776;100&#8211;200&#160;&#181;m. The 3D printed spinel lens demonstrates fairly good optical imaging ability, and the printed spinel diamond microlattices as a transparent photocatalyst support for TiO2 significantly enhance its photocatalytic efficiency compared with its opaque counterparts. Compared with other 3D printed transparent materials such as silica glass or organic polymers, the printed spinel ceramics have the advantages of broad optical window, high hardness, excellent high&#8208;temperature stability, and chemical resistance and therefore, have great potential to be used in various optical lenses/windows and photocatalyst supports for application in harsh environments.

         <title>Robust Superamphiphilic Membrane with a Closed&#8208;Loop Life Cycle</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new generation of biobased superamphiphilic vitrimer epoxy resin membranes to separate oil and water efficiently is reported. Similar to classical epoxy resins, this membrane shows strong mechanical robustness and sustains exposure to aqua regia and sodium hydroxide solutions. Furthermore, the blocked membrane can be easily recovered when contaminated with mixed foulants by using dynamic transesterification reactions.








Abstract
Oil&#8208;spill remediation is an international environmental challenge, and superamphiphilic membranes, as a promising solution, have recently drawn lots of attention. However, the robustness of the conventional membrane design is less satisfying under severe conditions during practical applications. Additionally, it is unavoidable for the membranes to face a series of foulants in their practical working environment, for example, algae and sand. These foulants will block the membrane, which leads to a new economic and environmental problem in terms of waste management at the end of their life. To address the aforementioned challenges, a new generation of superamphiphilic vitrimer epoxy resin membranes (SAVER) to separate oil and water efficiently is reported. Similar to classical epoxy resins, SAVER shows strong mechanical robustness and sustains exposure to aqua regia and sodium hydroxide solutions. Furthermore, the blocked membrane can be easily recovered when contaminated with mixed foulants by using dynamic transesterification reactions in the polymer network. The ease with which biobased SAVER can be manufactured, used, recycled, and re&#8208;used without losing value points to new directions in designing a closed&#8208;loop superamphiphilic membrane life cycle.

         <title>A Multichannel Ca2+ Nanomodulator for Multilevel Mitochondrial Destruction&#8208;Mediated Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A curcumin (CUR) and cisplatin (CDDP) co&#8208;incorporating multichannel calcium&#8208;ion (Ca2+) nanomodulator (PEGCaNMCUR+CDDP) demonstrates enhanced anticancer efficacy owing to induced multilevel mitochondrial damage by Ca2+ overload, which is promoted by the degradation of amorphous calcium carbonate, the CUR&#8208;mediated Ca2+ metabolism, and the CDDP&#8208;augmented synergistic destruction of mitochondria, which can be visualized by both fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging.








Abstract
Subcellular organelle&#8208;targeted nanoformulations for cancer theranostics are receiving increasing attention owing to their benefits of precise drug delivery, maximized therapeutic index, and reduced off&#8208;target side effects. Herein, a multichannel calcium ion (Ca2+) nanomodulator (CaNMCUR+CDDP), i.e., a cisplatin (CDDP) and curcumin (CUR) co&#8208;incorporating calcium carbonate (CaCO3) nanoparticle, is prepared by a facile one&#8208;pot strategy in a sealed container with in situ synthesized polydopamine (PDA) as a template to enhance Ca2+&#8208;overload&#8208;induced mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer therapy. After systemic administration, the PEGylated CaNMCUR+CDDP (PEGCaNMCUR+CDDP) selectively accumulates in tumor tissues, enters tumor cells, and induces multilevel destruction of mitochondria by the combined effects of burst Ca2+ release, Ca2+ efflux inhibition by CUR, and chemotherapeutic CDDP, thereby observably boosting mitochondria&#8208;targeted tumor inhibition. Fluorescence imaging of CUR combined with photoacoustic imaging of PDA facilitates the visualization of the nanomodulator. The facile and practical design of this multichannel Ca2+ nanomodulator will contribute to the development of multimodal bioimaging&#8208;guided organelle&#8208;targeted cancer therapy in the future.

         <title>Mechanically Efficient Cellular Materials Inspired by Cuttlebone</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complex structure and functional advantages of the cuttlebone are revealed. The cuttlebone structure, constructed like lamellar septa, separated by asymmetric, distorted S&#8208;shaped walls, exhibits superior strength and energy&#8208;absorption capability to the octet&#8208;truss lattice and conventional polymer and metal foams. This study represents an effective approach for the design and engineering of high&#8208;performance cellular materials through bioinspired 3D printing.








Abstract
Cellular materials with excellent mechanical efficiency are essential for aerospace structures, lightweight vehicles, and energy absorption. However, current synthetic cellular materials, such as lattice materials with a unit cell arranged in an ordered hierarchy, are still far behind many biological cellular materials in terms of both structural complexity and mechanical performance. Here, the complex porous structure and the mechanics of the cuttlebone are studied, which acts as a rigid buoyancy tank for cuttlefish to resist large hydrostatic pressure in the deep&#8208;sea environment. The cuttlebone structure, constructed like lamellar septa, separated by asymmetric, distorted S&#8208;shaped walls, exhibits superior strength and energy&#8208;absorption capability to the octet&#8208;truss lattice and conventional polymer and metal foams. Inspired by these findings, mechanically efficient cellular materials are designed and fabricated by 3D printing, which are greatly demanded for many applications including aerospace structures and tissue&#8208;engineering&#8208;scaffold. This study represents an effective approach for the design and engineering of high&#8208;performance cellular materials through bioinspired 3D printing.

         <title>Colorful Efficient Moir&#233;&#8208;Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Moir&#233; interference structure augments light diffraction channels, leading to elongated optical paths, and folds sunlight into the perovskite layer. Besides, the sets of Moir&#233; diffracted light achieve &#8220;1 + 1&#160;=&#160;3&#8221; comparing to the single diffraction grating. Therefore, moir&#233; perovskite solar cell has been constructed by the commercial DVD disc, resulting in the champion efficiency up to 20.17% (MAPbI3) and 21.76% ((FAPbI3)1&#8208;x(MAPbBr3)x).








Abstract
Light harvesting is crucial for thin&#8208;film solar cells. To substantially reduce optical loss in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), hierarchical light&#8208;trapping nano&#8208;architectures enable absorption enhancement to exceed the conventional upper limit and have great potential for achieving state&#8208;of&#8208;the art optoelectronic performances. However, it remains a great challenge to design and fabricate a superior hierarchical light&#8208;trapping nano&#8208;architecture, which exhibits extraordinary light&#8208;harvesting ability and simultaneously avoids deteriorating the electrical performance of PSCs. Herein, colorful efficient moir&#233;&#8208;PSCs are designed and fabricated incorporating moir&#233; interference structures by the imprinting method with the aid of a commercial DVD disc. It is experimentally and theoretically demonstrated that the light harvesting ability of the moir&#233; interference structure can be well manipulated through changing the rotation angle (0&#176;&#8211;90&#176;). The boosted short&#8208;circuit current is credited to augment light diffraction channels, leading to elongated optical paths, and fold sunlight into the perovskite layer. Moreover, the imprinting process suppresses the trap sites and voids at the active&#8208;layer interfaces with eliminated hysteresis. The moir&#233;&#8208;PSC with an optimized 30&#176; rotation angle achieves the best enhancement of light harvesting (28.5% higher than the pristine), resulting in efficiencies over 20.17% (MAPbI3) and 21.76% ((FAPbI3)1&#8208;x (MAPbBr3)x).

         <title>Photodriven Transient Picosecond Top&#8208;Layer Semiconductor to Metal Phase&#8208;Transition in p&#8208;Doped Molybdenum Disulfide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface S&#8211;Mo&#8211;S sheet of the p&#8208;doped indirect semiconductor 2H&#8208;MoS2 is found to undergo a transient 1T&#8208;MoS2&#8208;metallization of the surface layer by optical excitation with distinct threshold and saturation behaviour. This finding builds on the essential sensitivity of time&#8208;resolved electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis with tuneable synchrotron radiation.








Abstract
Visible light is shown to create a transient metallic S&#8211;Mo&#8211;S surface layer on bulk semiconducting p&#8208;doped indirect&#8208;bandgap 2H&#8208;MoS2. Optically created electron&#8211;hole pairs separate in the surface band bending region of the p&#8208;doped semiconducting crystal causing a transient accumulation of electrons in the surface region. This triggers a reversible 2H&#8208;semiconductor to 1T&#8208;metal phase&#8208;transition of the surface layer. Electron&#8211;phonon coupling of the indirect&#8208;bandgap p&#8208;doped 2H&#8208;MoS2 enables this efficient pathway even at a low density of excited electrons with a distinct optical excitation threshold and saturation behavior. This mechanism needs to be taken into consideration when describing the surface properties of illuminated p&#8208;doped 2H&#8208;MoS2. In particular, light&#8208;induced increased charge mobility and surface activation can cause and enhance the photocatalytic and photoassisted electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction of water on 2H&#8208;MoS2. Generally, it opens up for a way to control not only the surface of p&#8208;doped 2H&#8208;MoS2 but also related dichalcogenides and layered systems. The findings are based on the sensitivity of time&#8208;resolved electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis with photon&#8208;energy&#8208;tuneable synchrotron&#160;radiation.

         <title>A Morphable Ionic Electrode Based on Thermogel for Non&#8208;Invasive Hairy Plant Electrophysiology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex surface topography on biological tissues presents a major challenge in bio&#8208;electronic interfacing. Taking hairy plants as an example, an ionic electrode based on a thermogel is reported, which adapts and adheres to the abrupt hairy surface asperities, establishing a conformal and adhesive interface. It enables non&#8208;invasive plant electrophysiological measurement with a signal fidelity not achievable by conventional gel electrodes.








Abstract
Plant electrophysiology lays the foundation for smart plant interrogation and intervention. However, plant trichomes with hair&#8208;like morphologies present topographical features that challenge stable and high&#8208;fidelity non&#8208;invasive electrophysiology, due to the inadequate dynamic shape adaptability of conventional electrodes. Here, this issue is overcome using a morphable ionic electrode based on a thermogel, which gradually transforms from a viscous liquid to a viscoelastic gel. This transformation enables the morphable electrode to lock into the abrupt hairy surface irregularities and establish a conformal and adhesive interface. It achieves down to one tenth of the impedance and 4&#8211;5 times the adhesive strengths of conventional hydrogel electrodes on hairy leaves. As a result of the improved electrical and mechanical robustness, the morphable electrode can record more than one order of magnitude higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio on hairy plants and maintains high&#8208;fidelity recording despite plant movements, achieving superior performance to conventional hydrogel electrodes.

     alt="A Morphable Ionic Electrode Based on Thermogel for Non&#8208;Invasive Hairy Plant Electrophysiology"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complex surface topography on biological tissues presents a major challenge in bio&#8208;electronic interfacing. Taking hairy plants as an example, an ionic electrode based on a thermogel is reported, which adapts and adheres to the abrupt hairy surface asperities, establishing a conformal and adhesive interface. It enables non&#8208;invasive plant electrophysiological measurement with a signal fidelity not achievable by conventional gel electrodes.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plant electrophysiology lays the foundation for smart plant interrogation and intervention. However, plant trichomes with hair&#8208;like morphologies present topographical features that challenge stable and high&#8208;fidelity non&#8208;invasive electrophysiology, due to the inadequate dynamic shape adaptability of conventional electrodes. Here, this issue is overcome using a morphable ionic electrode based on a thermogel, which gradually transforms from a viscous liquid to a viscoelastic gel. This transformation enables the morphable electrode to lock into the abrupt hairy surface irregularities and establish a conformal and adhesive interface. It achieves down to one tenth of the impedance and 4&#8211;5 times the adhesive strengths of conventional hydrogel electrodes on hairy leaves. As a result of the improved electrical and mechanical robustness, the morphable electrode can record more than one order of magnitude higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio on hairy plants and maintains high&#8208;fidelity recording despite plant movements, achieving superior performance to conventional hydrogel electrodes. The reported morphable electrode is a promising tool for hairy plant electrophysiology and may be applied to diversely textured plants for advanced sensing and modulation.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Supramolecular Pins with Ultralong Efficient Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to intramolecular charge transfer enhanced by cucurbit[8]uril, a supramolecular pin shows afterglow with high phosphorescence quantum yield (99.38%) after incorporation into a rigid matrix, which is the highest yield reported to date for phosphorescent materials. Moreover, supramolecular pins are applied for targeted phosphorescence imaging of mitochondria.








Abstract
Constructing ultralong organic phosphorescent materials possessing a high quantum yield is challenging. Herein, assemblies of purely organic supramolecular pins composed of alkyl&#8208;bridged phenylpyridinium salts and cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) are reported. Different from &#8220;one host with two guests&#8221; and &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; binding, the binding formation of supramolecular pins is &#8220;one host with one guest&#8221; and &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;head,&#8221; which overcomes electrostatic repulsion and promotes intramolecular charge transfer. The supramolecular pin 1/CB[8] displays afterglow with high phosphorescence quantum yield (99.38%) after incorporation into a rigid matrix, which is the highest yield reported to date for phosphorescent materials. Moreover, multicolor photoluminescence can be obtained by different excitation wavelengths and ratios of host to guest. Owing to the redshift of the absorption, the supramolecular pins are applied for targeted phosphorescence imaging of mitochondria. This work will provide a reasonable supramolecular strategy to achieve redshifted and efficient phosphorescence both in the solid state and in aqueous solution.

         <title>A Spider&#8208;Silk&#8208;Inspired Wet Adhesive with Supercold Tolerance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spider&#8208;silk&#8208;inspired wet adhesive (SA) composed of polyurethane@poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PU@PVP, core@sheath) nanostructured fibers is fabricated by coaxial electrospinning. The SA achieves robust wet adhesion through a unique dissolving&#8211;wetting&#8211;adhering process of the core&#8211;sheath nanostructured fibers. Furthermore, the SA retains reliable adhesion from 4 to &#8722;196&#160;&#176;C, even maintains constant adhesion after being stored in liquid nitrogen, showing promising applicability in cryogenic environments.








Abstract
Conventional adhesives often encounter interfacial failure in humid conditions due to small droplets of water condensed on surface, but spider silks can capture prey in such environment. Here a robust spider&#8208;silk&#8208;inspired wet adhesive (SA) composed of core&#8211;sheath nanostructured fibers with hygroscopic adhesive nanosheath (poly(vinylpyrrolidone)) and supporting nanocore (polyurethane) is reported. The wet adhesion of the SA is achieved by a unique dissolving&#8211;wetting&#8211;adhering process of core&#8211;sheath nanostructured fibers, revealed by in situ observations at macro&#8208; and microscales. Further, the SA maintains reliable adhesion on wet and cold substrates from 4 to &#8722;196&#160;&#176;C and even tolerates splashing, violent shaking, and weight loading in liquid nitrogen (&#8722;196&#160;&#176;C), showing promising applicability in cryogenic environments. This study will provide an innovative route to design functional wet adhesives.

         <title>Wicking&#8211;Polarization&#8208;Induced Water Cluster Size Effect on Triboelectric Evaporation Textiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A textile that can couple active triboelectric polarization and passive wicking to break&#8208;up large&#8208;sized water clusters into small&#8208;sized water clusters or water monomers is reported to promote sweat evaporation. This textile is a useful weapon for eliminating sweat produced by strenuous exercise, and it also shows broad application prospects in quick&#8208;drying sportswear, cooling fabrics and wireless sports monitoring insoles.








Abstract
Sweating during exercise, physical labor, or hot weather leads to a feeling of discomfort. The stuffiness, stickiness, and heaviness brought by sweat may promote negative emotions or disease. Clothing, textiles, and wearable devices exacerbate these problems by restricting evaporation of sweat. Here, a textile that can promote and enhance sweat evaporation by coupling wicking and polarization is reported. The wicking is produced by the wettability gradient and pore size, which make the surface moisture content of the textile in contact with the skin strictly 0%. The polarization is driven by a ferroelectric&#8208;enhanced triboelectric textile. This textile degrades large&#8208;sized water clusters into small&#8208;sized water clusters or water monomers, so that the textiles have an excellent moisture evaporation rate (4.4 and 3.6 times faster than the cotton and polyester textiles, respectively). This work provides a new source of inspiration for quick&#8208;drying textiles and also finds an attractive application for triboelectric technology.

         <title>Tin Oxide Electron&#8208;Selective Layers for Efficient, Stable, and Scalable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Notable developments of SnO2 as an electron&#8208;selective layer for efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are reviewed, along with an overview of the fabrication methods and interfacial passivation routes. Furthermore, techno&#8208;economic and toxicology analyses of SnO2 are discussed for possible large&#8208;scale deployment of PSCs. Finally, the role of SnO2 in scaled module and tandem solar cell production is revealed.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have become a promising photovoltaic (PV) technology, where the evolution of the electron&#8208;selective layers (ESLs), an integral part of any PV device, has played a distinctive role to their progress. To date, the mesoporous titanium dioxide (TiO2)/compact TiO2 stack has been among the most used ESLs in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PSCs. However, this material requires high&#8208;temperature sintering and may induce hysteresis under operational conditions, raising concerns about its use toward commercialization. Recently, tin oxide (SnO2) has emerged as an attractive alternative ESL, thanks to its wide bandgap, high optical transmission, high carrier mobility, suitable band alignment with perovskites, and decent chemical stability. Additionally, its low&#8208;temperature processability enables compatibility with temperature&#8208;sensitive substrates, and thus flexible devices and tandem solar cells. Here, the notable developments of SnO2 as a perovskite&#8208;relevant ESL are reviewed with emphasis placed on the various fabrication methods and interfacial passivation routes toward champion solar cells with high stability. Further, a techno&#8208;economic analysis of SnO2 materials for large&#8208;scale deployment, together with a processing&#8208;toxicology assessment, is presented. Finally, a perspective on how SnO2 materials can be instrumental in successful large&#8208;scale module and perovskite&#8208;based tandem solar cell manufacturing is provided.

         <title>A &#916;E&#160;= 0.63 V Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalyst Enables High&#8208;Rate and Long&#8208;Cycling Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrahigh bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction and evolution is achieved with the indicator &#916;E&#160;= 0.63&#160;V, far exceeding the noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based benchmark and most reported electrocatalysts. Corresponding rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries afford ultralong lifespan over 3600 cycles at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and ultrahigh cycling current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries constitute promising next&#8208;generation energy storage devices due to their intrinsic safety, low cost, and feasibility to realize high cycling current density and long cycling lifespan. Nevertheless, their cathodic reactions involving oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution are highly sluggish in kinetics, requiring high&#8208;performance noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free bifunctional electrocatalysts that exceed the current noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based benchmarks. Herein, a noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free bifunctional electrocatalyst is fabricated, which demonstrates ultrahigh bifunctional activity and renders excellent performance in rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries. Concretely, atomic Co&#8211;N&#8211;C and NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are respectively selected as oxygen reduction and evolution active sites and are further rationally integrated to afford the resultant CoNC@LDH composite electrocatalyst. The CoNC@LDH electrocatalyst exhibits remarkable bifunctional activity delivering an indicator &#916;E of 0.63&#160;V, far exceeding the noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based Pt/C+Ir/C benchmark (&#916;E = 0.77&#160;V) and most reported electrocatalysts. Correspondingly, ultralong lifespan (over 3600 cycles at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and excellent rate performances (cycling current density at 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) are achieved in rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries. This work highlights the current advances of bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis and endows high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;cycling rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries for efficient sustainable energy storage.

         <title>Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Near Unit Internal Quantum Efficiency at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature high&#8208;efficiency light&#8208;emitting diodes based on metal halide perovskite FAPbI3 can work perfectly at low temperatures. A peak external quantum efficiency of 32.8%, corresponding to an internal quantum efficiency of 100%, is achieved at 45&#160;K. Importantly, the device shows almost no degradation after working at a constant current density of 200&#160;mA&#160;m&#8722;2 for 330&#160;h.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature&#8208;high&#8208;efficiency light&#8208;emitting diodes based on metal halide perovskite FAPbI3 are shown to be able to work perfectly at low temperatures. A peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 32.8%, corresponding to an internal quantum efficiency of 100%, is achieved at 45&#160;K. Importantly, the devices show almost no degradation after working at a constant current density of 200&#160;mA&#160;m&#8722;2 for 330&#160;h. The enhanced EQEs at low temperatures result from the increased photoluminescence quantum efficiencies of the perovskite, which is caused by the increased radiative recombination rate. Spectroscopic and calculation results suggest that the phase transitions of the FAPbI3 play an important role for the enhancement of exciton binding energy, which increases the recombination rate.

         <title>Selenic Acid Etching Assisted Vacancy Engineering for Designing Highly Active Electrocatalysts toward the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general, selenic&#8208;acid&#8208;assisted etching strategy from a metal&#8211;organic framework as a precursor is developed to realize carbon&#8208;coated 3d metal selenides MmSen (Co0.85Se1&#8722;x, NiSe2&#8722;x, FeSe2&#8208;x) with rich Se vacancies as high&#8208;performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals a mechanism that the introduction of abundant Se vacancies can improve the conductivity and reduce reaction barriers for the formation of intermediates.








Abstract
Oxygen evolution electrocatalysts are central to overall water splitting, and they should meet the requirements of low cost, high activity, high conductivity, and stable performance. Herein, a general, selenic&#8208;acid&#8208;assisted etching strategy is designed from a metal&#8211;organic framework as a precursor to realize carbon&#8208;coated 3d metal selenides MmSen (Co0.85Se1&#8722;x, NiSe2&#8722;x, FeSe2&#8722;x) with rich Se vacancies as high&#8208;performance precious metal&#8208;free oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Specifically, the as&#8208;prepared Co0.85Se1&#8722;x@C nanocages deliver an overpotential of only 231&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for the OER and the corresponding full water&#8208;splitting electrolyzer requires only a cell voltage of 1.49&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 in alkaline media. Density functional theory calculation reveals the important role of abundant Se vacancies for improving the catalytic activity through improving the conductivity and reducing reaction barriers for the formation of intermediates. Although phase change after long&#8208;term operation is observed with the formation of metal hydroxides, catalytic activity is not obviously affected, which strengthens the important role of the carbon network in the operating stability. This study provides a new opportunity to realize high&#8208;performance OER electrocatalysts by a general strategy on selenic acid etching assisted vacancy engineering.

         <title>An Electron Acceptor Analogue for Lowering Trap Density in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy of employing an acceptor&#8208;analogue is developed to efficiently reduce trap density to a magnitude of 1015&#160;cm&#8722;3 for organic photovoltaic materials, which is comparable to and even lower than those of some inorganic counterparts, and boosts the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells up to 17.8%.








Abstract
Typical organic semiconductor materials exhibit a high trap density of states, ranging from 1016 to 1018&#160;cm&#8722;3, which is one of the important factors in limiting the improvement of power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs). In order to reduce the trap density within OSCs, a new strategy to design and synthesize an electron acceptor analogue, BTPR, is developed, which is introduced into OSCs as a third component to enhance the molecular packing order of electron acceptor with and without blending a polymer donor. Finally, the as&#8208;cast ternary OSC devices employing BTPR show a notable PCE of 17.8%, with a low trap density (1015&#160;cm&#8722;3) and a low energy loss (0.217&#160;eV) caused by non&#8208;radiative recombination. This PCE is among the highest values for single&#8208;junction OSCs. The trap density of OSCs with the BTPR additives, as low as 1015&#160;cm&#8722;3, is comparable to and even lower than those of several typical high&#8208;performance inorganic/hybrid counterparts, like 1016&#160;cm&#8722;3 for amorphous silicon, 1016&#160;cm&#8722;3 for metal oxides, and 1014 to 1015&#160;cm&#8722;3 for halide perovskite thin film, and makes it promising for OSCs to obtain a PCE of up to 20%.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dense modification layer of a silane coupling agent enables Li metal to be stable in air and during cycling. This layer firmly adheres to the Li metal surface by forming Li&#63743;O&#63743;Si bonds, and it connects with the solid electrolyte interphase layer by chemical bonds and physical intertwining effects.








Abstract
The quality of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer is the decisive factor for the electrochemical performance of Li&#8208;metal&#8208;based batteries. Due to the absence of effective bonding, a natural SEI layer may exfoliate from the Li anode during interfacial fluctuations. Here, a silane coupling agent is introduced to serve as an adhesion promoter to bridge these two dissimilar materials via both chemical bonding and physical intertwining effects. Its inorganic reactive groups can combine with the Li substrate by forming Li&#63743;O&#63743;Si bonds, while organic functional groups can take part in the formation of the SEI layer and thereby bond with SEI components. Li metal electrodes with silane coupling agent modification exhibit excellent electrochemical performance, even under extreme testing conditions. This modification layer with dense structure could also protect the Li metal from corrosion by air, evidenced by the comparable electrochemical activity of the modified Li metal electrodes even after being exposed in air for 2 h. This design provides a promising pathway for the development of Li metal electrodes that will be stable both in electrolyte and in air.

         <title>A Novel Soft&#8208;Magnetic B2&#8208;Based Multiprincipal&#8208;Element Alloy with a Uniform Distribution of Coherent Body&#8208;Centered&#8208;Cubic Nanoprecipitates</title>

A novel Al1.5Co4Fe2Cr multiprincipal element alloy with ultrafine ferromagnetic body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (BCC) coherent nanoprecipitates in a B2 matrix is developed via tuning the chemical composition to manipulate the microstructure. It exhibits a prominent soft&#8208;magnetic property, high Curie temperature, and electrical resistivity, apparently attributable to the excellent stability of the coherent microstructure. The current approach offers a new way to design high&#8208;performance soft&#8208;magnetic alloys for high&#8208;temperature applications.








Abstract
Multiprincipal&#8208;element alloys (MPEAs), including high&#8208;entropy alloys, are a new class of materials whose thermodynamical properties are mainly driven by configuration entropy, rather than enthalpy in the traditional alloys, especially at high temperatures. Herein, the design of a novel soft&#8208;magnetic nonequiatomic, quaternary MPEA is described, via tuning its chemical composition to deliberately manipulate its microstructure, such that it contains ultrafine ferromagnetic body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (BCC) coherent nanoprecipitates (3&#8211;7&#160;nm) uniformly distributed in a B2&#8208;phase matrix. The new alloy Al1.5Co4Fe2Cr exhibits high saturation magnetization (MS&#160;= 135.3 emu g&#8208;1), low coercivity (HC&#160;= 127.3 A m&#8208;1), high Curie temperature (TC&#160;= 1061 K), and high electrical resistivity (&#961;&#160; =&#160;244 &#956;&#937; cm), promising for soft magnets. More importantly, these prominent soft&#8208;magnetic properties are observed to be retained even after the alloy is thermally exposed at 873 K for 555 h, apparently attributable to the excellent stability of the coherent microstructure. The versatility of the magnetic properties of this new alloy is discussed in light of the microstructural change induced by tuning the chemical composition, and the enhanced performance of the alloy is compared directly with that of the traditional soft&#8208;magnetic alloys. The perspective is also addressed to design high&#8208;performance soft&#8208;magnetic alloys for high&#8208;temperature applications.

         <title>Frequency&#8208;Independent Terahertz Anomalous Hall Effect in DyCo5, Co32Fe68, and Gd27Fe73 Thin Films from DC to 40 THz</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is a fundamental spintronic phenomenon that is a potentially essential ingredient of future high&#8208;speed spintronic devices operating at terahertz (THz) frequencies. It is revealed that the AHE remains operative from DC up to 40 THz with a flat frequency response in thin films of three technologically relevant magnetic materials: DyCo5, Co32Fe68, and Gd27Fe73.








Abstract
The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is a fundamental spintronic charge&#8208;to&#8208;charge&#8208;current conversion phenomenon and closely related to spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge&#8208;current conversion by the spin Hall effect. Future high&#8208;speed spintronic devices will crucially rely on such conversion phenomena at terahertz (THz) frequencies. Here, it is revealed that the AHE remains operative from DC up to 40 THz with a flat frequency response in thin films of three technologically relevant magnetic materials: DyCo5, Co32Fe68, and Gd27Fe73. The frequency&#8208;dependent conductivity&#8208;tensor elements &#963;xx and &#963;yx&#8197;are&#8197;measured, and good agreement with DC measurements is found. The experimental findings are fully consistent with ab initio calculations of &#963;yx for CoFe and highlight the role of the large Drude scattering rate (&#8776;100&#160;THz) of metal thin films, which smears out any sharp spectral features of the THz AHE. Finally, it is found that the intrinsic contribution to the THz AHE dominates over the extrinsic mechanisms for the Co32Fe68 sample. The results imply that the AHE and related effects such as the spin Hall effect are highly promising ingredients of future THz spintronic devices reliably operating from DC to 40 THz and beyond.

         <title>Efficient Electron Transport Layer Free Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Solar Cells with Superior Device Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells based on a new electron donor reach power conversion efficiencies exceeding 13% with and without the use of electrode interlayers but differ strongly in stability. Surprisingly, the surface composition and morphology of the interlayers deteriorate with time even under inert conditions, reducing device performance. Without interlayers, the cells give stable high performance.








Abstract
Electron transport layers (ETLs) placed between the electrodes and a photoactive layer can enhance the performance of organic solar cells but also impose limitations. Most ETLs are ultrathin films, and their deposition can disturb the morphology of the photoactive layers, complicate device fabrication, raise cost, and also affect device stability. To fully overcome such drawbacks, efficient organic solar cells that operate without an ETL are preferred. In this study, a new small&#8208;molecule electron donor (H31) based on a thiophene&#8208;substituted benzodithiophene core unit with trialkylsilyl side chains is designed and synthesized. Blending H31 with the electron acceptor Y6 gives solar cells with power conversion efficiencies exceeding 13% with and without 2,9&#8208;bis[3&#8208;(dimethyloxidoamino)propyl]anthra[2,1,9&#8208;def:6,5,10&#8208;d&#8242;e&#8242;f&#8201;&#8242;]diisoquinoline&#8208;1,3,8,10(2H,9H)&#8208;tetrone (PDINO) as the ETL. The ETL&#8208;free cells deliver a superior shelf life compared to devices with an ETL. Small&#8208;molecule donor&#8211;acceptor blends thus provide interesting perspectives for achieving efficient, reproducible, and stable device architectures without electrode interlayers.

         <title>Harnessing Ionic Power from Equilibrium Electrolyte Solution via Photoinduced Active Ion Transport through van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals&#8208;Like Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;dichalcogenide&#8208;based van der Waals multilayer heterostructures are used to harvest ionic power from equilibrium electrolyte solutions via a coupled photon&#8208;carrier&#8211;ion transport mechanism. Under optimized conditions, an uttermost power density of nearly 2 mW&#160;m&#8211;2 is achieved under one sun equivalent excitation.








Abstract
Nanofluidic ion transport through van der Waals heterostructures, composed of two or more types of reconstructed 2D nanomaterials, gives rise to fascinating opportunities for light&#8208;energy harvesting, due to coupling between the optoelectronic properties of the layered constituents and ion transport in between the atomic layers. Here, a photoinduced active ion transport phenomenon through transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)&#8208;based van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals&#8208;like multilayer heterostructures is reported for harnessing ionic power from equilibrium electrolyte solution. The binary heterostructure comprises sequentially stacked 2D&#8208;WS2 and 2D&#8208;MoS2 multilayers with sub&#8208;1 nm interlayer spacing.

     alt="Harnessing Ionic Power from Equilibrium Electrolyte Solution via Photoinduced Active Ion Transport through van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals&#8208;Like Heterostructures"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;dichalcogenide&#8208;based van der Waals multilayer heterostructures are used to harvest ionic power from equilibrium electrolyte solutions via a coupled photon&#8208;carrier&#8211;ion transport mechanism. Under optimized conditions, an uttermost power density of nearly 2 mW&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt; is achieved under one sun equivalent excitation.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanofluidic ion transport through van der Waals heterostructures, composed of two or more types of reconstructed 2D nanomaterials, gives rise to fascinating opportunities for light&#8208;energy harvesting, due to coupling between the optoelectronic properties of the layered constituents and ion transport in between the atomic layers. Here, a photoinduced active ion transport phenomenon through transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)&#8208;based van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals&#8208;like multilayer heterostructures is reported for harnessing ionic power from equilibrium electrolyte solution. The binary heterostructure comprises sequentially stacked 2D&#8208;WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 2D&#8208;MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; multilayers with sub&#8208;1 nm interlayer spacing. Upon visible&#8208;light illumination, a net ionic flow is initiated through the Janus membrane, suggesting a directional cationic transport from WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; part. The transport mechanism is explained in terms of a photovoltaic effect due to type II band alignment of WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterostructures. The driving mechanism can be generally applied to a variety of heterogeneous TMD membranes with type II semiconductor heterojunctions. In equilibrium ionic solutions, the maximum ionic photoresponse approaches &#8776;21 &#181;A&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt; and &#8776;45&#160;mV under one sun equivalent excitation. Under optimized conditions, the harvested power density reaches 2&#160;mW&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Multiresponsive Nonvolatile Memories Based on Optically Switchable Ferroelectric Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiresponsive organic device based on a photochromic&#8211;ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistor, which is capable of operating as nonvolatile memory with 11 bit memory storage capacity in a single device, is fabricated. The memory elements can be written and erased independently by light or an electric field, with accurate control over the readout signal, excellent repeatability, fast response, and high retention time.








Abstract
Organic transistors are key elements for flexible, wearable, and biocompatible logic applications. Multiresponsivity is highly sought&#8208;after in organic electronics to enable sophisticated operations and functions. Such a challenge can be pursued by integrating more components in a single device, each one responding to a specific external stimulus. Here, the first multiresponsive organic device based on a photochromic&#8211;ferroelectric organic field&#8208;effect transistor, which is capable of operating as nonvolatile memory with 11 bit memory storage capacity in a single device, is reported. The memory elements can be written and erased independently by means of light or an electric field, with accurate control over the readout signal, excellent repeatability, fast response, and high retention time. Such a proof of concept paves the way toward enhanced functional complexity in optoelectronics via the interfacing of multiple components in a single device, in a fully integrated low&#8208;cost technology compatible with flexible substrates.

         <title>Solvent Engineering of the Precursor Solution toward Large&#8208;Area Production of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solvent engineering of precursor solutions toward efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is reviewed comprehensively. The key role of solvent engineering for solution&#8208;processed perovskite film is highlighted, especially for the large&#8208;area production of PSCs. Light is shed on the significance of solvent engineering in PSCs, and critical guidance for future commercialization development of highly efficient PSCs is provided.








Abstract
Solar cells based on emerging organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have reached certified power conversion efficiency as high as 25.5%, showing great potential in the next generation of photovoltaics toward large&#8208;scale industrialization. The most competitive feature of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is that the perovskite light absorber can be fabricated by a low&#8208;cost solution method. For the solution method, the characteristics of the solvent play a key role in determining the crystallization kinetics, growth orientation, and optoelectronic properties of the perovskite film. Although significant progress has been made in the field of solvent engineering in PSCs, it is still challenging for the solution method to sustainably produce industrial&#8208;scale PSCs for future commercialization applications. Herein, the advanced progress of solvent engineering of precursor solution in terms of coordination regulation and toxicity reduction is highlighted. The physical and chemical characteristics of different solvents in reducing the toxicity of the solvent system, regulating the coordination property of the precursor solution, controlling the film&#8208;forming process of the perovskite film, and adjusting the photovoltaic performance of the PSC are systematically discussed. Lastly, important perspectives on solvent engineering of the perovskite precursor solution toward future industrial production of high&#8208;performance PSCs are provided.

         <title>Porous Semiconducting Polymers Enable High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of porous polymer films are fabricated using the efficient breath figure method and their performance in organic electrochemical transistors is investigated. Introducing the porosity significantly enhances the ion penetration rates and results in high transconductance and fast switching properties.








Abstract
Organic polymer electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are of great interest for flexible electronics and bioelectronics applications owing to their high transconductance and low operating voltage. However, efficient OECT operation must delicately balance the seemingly incompatible materials optimizations of redox chemistry, active layer electronic transport, and ion penetration/transport. The latter characteristics are particularly challenging since most high&#8208;mobility semiconducting polymers are hydrophobic, which hinders efficient ion penetration, hence limiting OECT performance. Here, the properties and OECT response of a series of dense and porous semiconducting polymer films are compared, the latter fabricated via a facile breath figure approach. This methodology enables fast ion doping, high transconductance (up to 364 S cm&#8722;1), and a low subthreshold swing for the hydrophobic polymers DPPDTT and P3HT, rivalling or exceeding the metrics of the relatively hydrophilic polymer, Pg2T&#8208;T. Furthermore, the porous morphology also enhances the transconductance of hydrophilic polymers, offering a general strategy for fabricating high&#8208;performance electrochemical transistors.

         <title>Tip&#8208;Enhanced Electric Field: A New Mechanism Promoting Mass Transfer in Oxygen Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new mechanistic understanding of the enhanced alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics is achieved by employing dense arrays of nanocones with sharp tips. A local electric field promotes aggregation of hydroxide ions  near the high&#8208;curvature active sites, leading to lower overpotential and higher intrinsic OER activity compared to blunt cones.








Abstract
The slow kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) causes high power consumption for electrochemical water splitting. Various strategies have been attempted to accelerate the OER rate, but there are few studies on regulating the transport of reactants especially under large current densities when the mass transfer factor dominates the evolution reactions. Herein, NixFe1&#8211;x alloy nanocones arrays (with &#8776;2 nm surface NiO/NiFe(OH)2 layer) are adopted to boost the transport of reactants. Finite element analysis suggests that the high&#8208;curvature tips can enhance the local electric field, which induces an order of magnitude higher concentration of hydroxide ions (OH&#8722;) at the active sites and promotes intrinsic OER activity by 67% at 1.5 V. Experimental results show that a fabricated NiFe nanocone array electrode, with optimized alloy composition, has a small overpotential of 190 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and 255 mV at 500 mA cm&#8722;2. When calibrated by electrochemical surface area, the nanocones electrode outperforms the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OER electrocatalysts. The positive effect of the tip&#8208;enhanced local electric field in promoting mass transfer is also confirmed by comparing samples with different tip curvature radii. It is suggested that this local field enhanced OER kinetics is a generic effect to other OER catalysts.

         <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;Assembled Vacuolated Coacervates Control Macromolecule Spatiotemporal Distribution to Provide a Stable Segregated Cell Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interactive core&#8211;shell nanoparticles with different chemical makeups can self&#8208;assemble into stable vacuolated coacervates under physiological conditions, driven by physical interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonding) derived from the end groups of the hydrophilic shell, thus providing novel insights into the morphological, physical, and functional complexity of coacervate organelles.








Abstract
Membraneless coacervate compartments in the intracellular and pericellular space mediate critical cellular functions. Developing synthetic coacervates that emulate the morphological, physical, and functional complexity of these natural coacervates is challenging but highly desirable. Herein, a generalizable nanoparticle assembly (NPA) strategy is developed, which is applicable to interactive core&#8211;shell nanoparticles with different chemical makeups, to fabricate vacuolated coacervates. The obtained NPA coacervates contain stable internal vacuoles to provide segregated microcompartments, which can mediate the spatially heterogeneous distribution of diverse macromolecules via restricted diffusion. It is further shown that the vacuolated NPA coacervates can harbor and retain macromolecular medium supplements to regulate the functions of cells encapsulated in vacuoles. Furthermore, the restricted macromolecule diffusion can be abolished on demand via the triggered coacervate&#8211;hydrogel transition, thereby altering the exposure of encapsulated cells to environmental factors. It is believed that the NPA strategy provides new insights into the design principles of hierarchical coacervates that hold promising potential for a wide array of biomedical applications.

         <title>Biomimetic Design of Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Hybrid Nanozymes as Superoxide Scavengers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The key factor for de novo design of a metalloenzyme mimetic includes a suitable protein scaffold and enzyme active centers. A biomimetic cascade nanozyme is artificially created based on the hybridization of a recombinant ferritin&#8208;heavy&#8208;chain&#8208;based protein scaffold modified for mitochondria&#8208;targeting and a Mn&#8208;based nanoparticle as the core of the enzymatic activity.








Abstract
Development of enzyme mimics for the scavenging of excessive mitochondrial superoxide (O2&#8226;&#8722;) can serve as an effective strategy in the treatment of many diseases. Here, protein reconstruction technology and nanotechnology is taken advantage of to biomimetically create an artificial hybrid nanozyme. These nanozymes consist of ferritin&#8208;heavy&#8208;chain&#8208;based protein as the enzyme scaffold and a metal nanoparticle core as the enzyme active center. This artificial cascade nanozyme possesses superoxide dismutase&#8208; and catalase&#8208;like activities and also targets mitochondria by overcoming multiple biological barriers. Using cardiac ischemia&#8208;reperfusion animal models, the protective advantages of the hybrid nanozymes are demonstrated in vivo during mitochondrial oxidative injury and in the recovery of heart functionality following infarction via systemic delivery and localized release from adhesive hydrogels (i.e., cardiac patch), respectively. This study illustrates a de novo design strategy in the development of enzyme mimics and provides a promising therapeutic option for alleviating oxidative damage in regenerative medicine.

         <title>Ultrathin Amorphous/Crystalline Heterophase Rh and Rh Alloy Nanosheets as Tandem Catalysts for Direct Indole Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin Rh and RhM (M = Cu, Zn, Ru) alloy nanosheets with amorphous/crystalline heterophases are successfully synthesized. In tandem catalysis to directly synthesize indole, the amorphous/crystalline heterophase Rh nanosheets (NSs) outperform their crystalline counterpart, demonstrating much higher catalytic activity. Impressively, the amorphous/crystalline heterophase RhCu NSs show dramatically enhanced indole selectivity of over 99.9% and excellent activity.








Abstract
Heterogeneous noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysis plays an essential role in the production of fine chemicals. Rh&#8208;based catalysts are one of the most active candidates for indole synthesis. However, it is still highly desired to develop heterogeneous Rh&#8208;based catalysts with high activity and selectivity. In this work, a general, facile wet&#8208;chemical method is reported to synthesize ultrathin amorphous/crystalline heterophase Rh and Rh&#8208;based bimetallic alloy nanosheets (NSs), including RhCu, RhZn, and RhRu. Impressively, the amorphous/crystalline heterophase Rh NSs exhibit enhanced catalytic activity toward the direct synthesis of indole compared to the crystalline counterpart. Importantly, the obtained amorphous/crystalline heterophase RhCu alloy NSs can further enhance the selectivity to indole of &gt;99.9% and the conversion is 100%. This work demonstrates the importance of phase engineering and metal alloying in the rational design and synthesis of tandem heterogeneous catalysts toward fine chemical synthesis.

         <title>Revealing Structural Disorder in Hydrogenated Amorphous Silicon for a Low&#8208;Loss Photonic Platform at Visible Frequencies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomic bonding networks of hydrogenated amorphous silicon are revealed to reduce its optical loss in the visible region. Atomic bonding networks are manipulated by controlling the process conditions of plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition. The optimal atomic configuration demonstrates the low&#8208;loss hydrogenated amorphous silicon as being an efficient photonic platform by expanding the working frequencies from the infrared to the visible spectrum.








Abstract
The high refractive index of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a&#8208;Si:H) at optical frequencies is an essential property for the efficient modulation of the phase and amplitude of light. However, substantial optical loss represented by its high extinction coefficient prevents it from being utilized widely. Here, the bonding configurations of a&#8208;Si:H are investigated, in order to manipulate the extinction coefficient and produce a material that is competitive with conventional transparent materials, such as titanium dioxide and gallium nitride. This is achieved by controlling the hydrogenation and silicon disorder by adjusting the chemical deposition conditions. The extinction coefficient of the low&#8208;loss a&#8208;Si:H reaches a minimum of 0.082 at the wavelength of 450&#160;nm, which is lower than that of crystalline silicon (0.13). Beam&#8208;steering metasurfaces are demonstrated to validate the low&#8208;loss optical properties, reaching measured efficiencies of 42%, 62%, and 75% at the wavelengths of 450, 532, and 635&#160;nm, respectively. Considering its compatibility with mature complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor processes, the low&#8208;loss a&#8208;Si:H will provide a platform for efficient photonic operating in the full visible regime.

         <title>Combination of Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation with Selective Oxygenation of Organic Substrates using Manganese Borophosphates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical manganese borophosphates are employed to address two highly demanding yet kinetically controlled reactions: durable electrochemical water oxidation to efficiently produce molecular oxygen and the selective oxygenation of organics to deliver prominent value&#8208;added chemicals.








Abstract
One of the key catalytic reactions for life on earth, the oxidation of water to molecular oxygen, occurs in the oxygen&#8208;evolving complex of the photosystem II (PSII) mediated by a manganese&#8208;containing cluster. Considerable efforts in this research area embrace the development of efficient artificial manganese&#8208;based catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Using artificial OER catalysts for selective oxygenation of organic substrates to produce value&#8208;added chemicals is a worthwhile objective. However, unsatisfying catalytic performance and poor stability have been a fundamental bottleneck in the field of artificial PSII analogs. Herein, for the first time, a manganese&#8208;based anode material is developed and paired up for combining electrocatalytic water oxidation and selective oxygenations of organics delivering the highest efficiency reported to date. This can be achieved by employing helical manganese borophosphates, representing a new class of materials. The uniquely high catalytic activity and durability (over 5 months) of the latter precursors in alkaline media are attributed to its unexpected surface transformation into an amorphous MnOx phase with a birnessite&#8208;like short&#8208;range order and surface&#8208;stabilized MnIII sites under extended electrical bias, as unequivocally demonstrated by a combination of in situ Raman and quasi in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy as well as ex situ methods.

         <title>Terahertz Spin&#8208;to&#8208;Charge Conversion by Interfacial Skew Scattering in Metallic Bilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Terahertz emission spectroscopy is used to study spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion (S2C) in ferromagnetic (F)|nonmagnetic (N) bilayer metal thin films. The measurements indicate that S2C at the F/N interfaces can become comparable to the overall S2C and that the sign is drastically affected by interface modifications. A possible extrinsic S2C mechanism, skew scattering of spin&#8208;polarized electrons at interfacial imperfections, is suggested.








Abstract
The efficient conversion of spin to charge transport and vice versa is of major relevance for the detection and generation of spin currents in spin&#8208;based electronics. Interfaces of heterostructures are known to have a marked impact on this process. Here, terahertz (THz) emission spectroscopy is used to study ultrafast spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge&#8208;current conversion (S2C) in about 50 prototypical F|N bilayers consisting of a ferromagnetic layer F (e.g., Ni81Fe19, Co, or Fe) and a nonmagnetic layer N with strong (Pt) or weak (Cu and Al) spin&#8208;orbit coupling. Varying the structure of the F/N interface leads to a drastic change in the amplitude and even inversion of the polarity of the THz charge current. Remarkably, when N is a material with small spin Hall angle, a dominant interface contribution to the ultrafast charge current is found. Its magnitude amounts to as much as about 20% of that found in the F|Pt reference sample. Symmetry arguments and first&#8208;principles calculations strongly suggest that the interfacial S2C arises from skew scattering of spin&#8208;polarized electrons at interface imperfections. The results highlight the potential of skew scattering for interfacial S2C and propose a promising route to enhanced S2C by tailored interfaces at all frequencies from DC to terahertz.

         <title>A Virus&#8208;Mimicking Nucleic Acid Nanogel Reprograms Microglia and Macrophages for Glioblastoma Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A virus&#8208;mimicking membrane&#8208;coated nucleic acid nanogel Vir&#8208;Gel is constructed using therapeutic miRNA as a crosslinker to direct the self&#8208;assembly of DNA&#8208;grafted polycaprolactone (DNA&#8208;g&#8208;PCL) brushes to form a nanogel. Vir&#8208;Gel can effectively reprogram microglia and macrophages from a tumor&#8208;promoting M2 phenotype to an anti&#8208;tumor M1 phenotype, thereby breaking the immunosuppression tumor microenvironment of glioblastoma and improving the therapeutic effect.








Abstract
Immunotherapy is recognized as one of the most promising approaches to treat cancers. However, its effect in glioblastoma (GBM) treatment is insufficient, which can in part be attributed to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Microglia and macrophages are the main immune infiltrating cells in the TME of GBM. Unfortunately, instead of initiating the anti&#8208;tumor response, GBM&#8208;infiltrating microglia and macrophages switch to a tumor&#8208;promoting phenotype (M2), and support tumor growth, angiogenesis, and immunosuppression by the release of cytokines. In this work, a virus&#8208;mimicking membrane&#8208;coated nucleic acid nanogel Vir&#8208;Gel embedded with therapeutic miRNA is developed, which can reprogram microglia and macrophages from a pro&#8208;invasive M2 phenotype to an anti&#8208;tumor M1 phenotype. By mimicking the virus infection process, Vir&#8208;Gel significantly enhances the targetability and cell uptake efficiency of the miR155&#8208;bearing nucleic acid nanogel. In vivo evaluations demonstrate that Vir&#8208;Gel apparently prolongs the circulation lifetime of miR155 and endows it with an active tumor&#8208;targeting capability and excellent tumor inhibition efficacy. Owing to its noninvasive feature and effective delivery capability, the virus&#8208;mimicking nucleic acid nanogel provides a general and convenient platform that can successfully treat a wide range of diseases.

         <title>Directional Polarized Light Emission from Thin&#8208;Film Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly directional and polarized light emission is demonstrated in thin&#8208;film light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) by suppressing the background emission and extracting only the transverse electric (TE) waveguide mode. It is found that the TE waveguide mode increases with the refractive index of the emitting layer and a 2.6 times higher current efficiency is achieved in a perovskite LED.








Abstract
Light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with directional and polarized light emission have many photonic applications, and beam shaping of these devices is fundamentally challenging because they are Lambertian light sources. In this work, using organic and perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) for demonstrations, by selectively diffracting the transverse electric (TE) waveguide mode while suppressing other optical modes in a nanostructured LED, the authors first demonstrate highly directional light emission from a full&#8208;area organic LED with a small divergence angle less than 3&#176; and a TE to transverse magnetic (TM) polarization extinction ratio of 13. The highly selective diffraction of only the TE waveguide mode is possible due to the planarization of the device stack by thermal evaporation and solution processing. Using this strategy, directional and polarized emission from a perovskite LED having a current efficiency 2.6 times compared to the reference planar device is further demonstrated. This large enhancement in efficiency in the PeLED is attributed to a larger contribution from the TE waveguide mode resulting from the high refractive index in perovskite materials.

         <title>From Understanding Mechanical Behavior to Curvature Prediction of Humidity&#8208;Triggered Bilayer Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding of the mechanical properties of bilayer actuators based on the humidity&#8208;responsive polymer poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) in combination with volumetric strain measurements allows for the curvature prediction of humidity&#8208;triggered bilayer actuators by an analytic composite beam model.








Abstract
Nature will always be an endless source of bioinspiration for man&#8208;made smart materials and multifunctional devices. Impressively, even cutoff leaves from resurrection plants can autonomously and reproducibly change their shape upon humidity changes, which goes along with total recovery of their mechanical properties after being completely dried. In this work, simple bilayers are presented as autonomously moving, humidity&#8208;triggered bending actuators. The bilayers&#8212;showing reproducible bending behavior with reversible kinematics and multiway behavior&#8212;are studied in terms of their mechanical behavior upon humidity changes. The active layer consists of a highly conducting polymer film based on poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) with poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) as passive layer. The response to humidity is explored with dynamic mechanical thermal analysis and quartz crystal microbalance measurements. Introduction of a composite beam model allows to predict the curvature of the actuators with input from the rheological measurements. It is clearly demonstrated that volumetric strain and Young's modulus, both heavily influenced by the water uptake, dominate the bending behavior and therefore the curvature of the actuators. This loop of rheological characterization coupled with an analytical model allows to predict curvatures of in principle any complex geometry and material combination for moving parts in soft robotics.

         <title>Realizing an All&#8208;Round Hydrogel Electrolyte toward Environmentally Adaptive Dendrite&#8208;Free Aqueous Zn&#8211;MnO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogel electrolyte with high ionic conductivity, ultralow freezing point, excellent mechanical properties, good self&#8208;healing ability, high adhesion, and good heat&#8208;resistance ability is constructed. It can effectively suppress the growth of zinc dendrites and the occurrence of parasitic side reactions, thereby enabling a high&#8208;performance flexible quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8211;MnO2 battery that can work normally in a wide temperature range.








Abstract
Flexible energy storage devices are at the forefront of next&#8208;generation power supplies, one of the most important components of which is the gel electrolyte. However, shortcomings exist, more or less, for all the currently developed hydrogel electrolytes. Herein, a facile and cost&#8208;effective method is developed to construct an all&#8208;round hydrogel electrolyte by using cotton as the raw material, tetraethyl orthosilicate as the crosslinker, and glycerol as the antifreezing agent. The obtained hydrogel electrolyte has high ionic conductivity, excellent mechanical properties (e.g., high tensile strength and elasticity), ultralow freezing point, good self&#8208;healing ability, high adhesion, and good heat&#8208;resistance ability. Remarkably, this hydrogel electrolyte can provide a record&#8208;breaking high ionic conductivity of 19.4 mS cm&#8722;1 at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C compared with previously reported aqueous electrolytes for zinc&#8208;ion batteries. In addition, this hydrogel electrolyte can significantly inhibit zinc dendritic growth and parasitic side reactions from &#8722;40 to 60&#160;&#176;C. With this hydrogel electrolyte, a flexible quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8211;MnO2 battery is assembled, which shows remarkable energy densities from &#8722;40 to 60&#160;&#176;C. The battery also exhibits outstanding cycling durability and has high endurance under various harsh conditions. This work opens new opportunities for the development of hydrogel electrolytes.

         <title>Metallic Diluted Dimerization in VO2 Tweeds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8211;insulator transition of VO2 holds promise for numerous applications, yet the phase trajectory remains poorly understood. It is shown that strained films develop multicomponent tweeds prior to relaxation to the monoclinic ground state, triggered by the nucleation of partially dimerized V&#8208;chains. The suppression of the bonding/antibonding splitting in&#160;&#8220;isolated&#8221; V sites renders metallicity to this new monoclinic phase.








Abstract
The observation of electronic phase separation textures in vanadium dioxide, a prototypical electron&#8208;correlated oxide, has recently added new perspectives on the long standing debate about its metal&#8211;insulator transition and its applications. Yet, the lack of atomically resolved information on phases accompanying such complex patterns still hinders a comprehensive understanding of the transition and its implementation in practical devices. In this work, atomic resolution imaging and spectroscopy unveils the existence of ferroelastic tweed structures on &#8776;5 nm length scales, well below the resolution limit of currently used spectroscopic imaging techniques. Moreover, density functional theory calculations show that this pretransitional fine&#8208;scale tweed, which on average looks and behaves like the standard metallic rutile phase, is in fact weaved by semi&#8208;dimerized chains of vanadium in a new monoclinic phase that represents a structural bridge to the monoclinic insulating ground state. These observations provide a multiscale perspective for the interpretation of existing data, whereby phase coexistence and structural intermixing can occur all the way down to the atomic scale.

         <title>Fused Aromatic Network with Exceptionally High Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystalline fused aromatic network with a basal plane stoichiometry of C5N exhibits exceptionally high carrier mobility. The thin flakes of C5N, obtained by poly(dimethylsiloxane) stamping, show ambipolar charge transport and remarkably high electron and hole mobilities, demonstrating their huge potential for applications in thin&#8208;film electronics.








Abstract
Recently, studies of 2D organic layered materials with unique electronic properties have generated considerable interest in the research community. However, the development of organic materials with functional electrical transport properties is still needed. Here, a 2D fused aromatic network (FAN) structure with a C5N basal plane stoichiometry is designed and synthesized, and thin films are cast from C5N solution onto silicon dioxide substrates. Then field&#8208;effect transistors are fabricated using C5N thin flakes as the active layer in a bottom&#8208;gate top&#8208;contact configuration to characterize their electrical properties. The C5N thin flakes, isolated by polydimethylsiloxane stamping, exhibit ambipolar charge transport and extraordinarily high electron (996 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and hole (501 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) mobilities, surpassing the performance of most pristine organic materials without doping. These results demonstrate their vast potential for applications in thin&#8208;film optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Unprecedented Fluorophore Photostability Enabled by Low&#8208;Loss Organic Hyperbolic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorophores are much more photostable on organic hyperbolic materials (OHMs) than on glass. On a glass substrate, fluorophores are photobleached almost immediately; highly photostable fluorophores, however, are observed on an OHM substrate. Fluorophore photobleaching lifetimes are lengthened up to four orders of magnitude with a 230&#8208;fold increase in photon count.








Abstract
The dynamics of photons in fluorescent molecules plays a key role in fluorescence imaging, optical sensing, organic photovoltaics, and displays. Photobleaching is an irreversible photodegradation process of fluorophores, representing a fundamental limitation in relevant optical applications. Chemical reagents are used to suppress the photobleaching rate but with exceptionally high specificity for each type of fluorophore. Here, using organic hyperbolic materials (OHMs), an optical platform to achieve unprecedented fluorophore photostability without any chemical specificity is demonstrated. A more than 500&#8208;fold lengthening of the photobleaching lifetime and a 230&#8208;fold increase in the total emitted photon counts are observed simultaneously. These exceptional improvements solely come from the low&#8208;loss hyperbolic dispersion of OHM films and the large resultant Purcell effect in the visible spectral range. The demonstrated OHM platform may open up a new paradigm in nanophotonics and organic plasmonics for super&#8208;resolution imaging and the engineering of light&#8211;matter interactions at the nanoscale.

         <title>Interplay of Different Major Ampullate Spidroins during Assembly and Implications for Fiber Mechanics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural spider major ampullate silk exhibits mechanical properties unmatched by most other known natural or man&#8208;made fibrous materials. Upon recombinant co&#8208;production of two different spidroins derived from one spider species, they interconnect already in solution and during assembly. Their interplay yields fibers with overall properties different to those of one&#8208;protein fibers, but equaling that of the natural blueprint.








Abstract
Major ampullate (MA) spider silk has fascinating mechanical properties combining strength and elasticity. All known natural MA silks contain at least two or more different spidroins; however, it is unknown why and if there is any interplay in the spinning dope. Here, two different spidroins from Araneus diadematus are co&#8208;produced in Escherichia coli to study the possible dimerization and effects thereof on the mechanical properties of fibers. During the production of the two spidroins, a mixture of homo&#8208; and heterodimers is formed triggered by the carboxyl&#8208;terminal domains. Interestingly, homodimeric species of the individual spidroins self&#8208;assemble differently in comparison to heterodimers, and stoichiometric mixtures of homo&#8208; and heterodimers yield spidroin networks upon assembly with huge impact on fiber mechanics upon spinning. The obtained results provide the basis for man&#8208;made tuning of spinning dopes to yield high&#8208;performance fibers.

         <title>Designing the Bending Stiffness of 2D Material Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfacial engineering is used to tune the bending stiffness of 2D material heterostructures composed of graphene and MoS2 by over several hundred percent. The incorporation of twisted or heterointerfaces facilitates interlayer slip, which dramatically softens the 2D stacks. A bending model is developed to predict and design the deformability of 2D heterostructures as a function of composition, stacking order, and geometry of the structure.








Abstract
2D monolayers represent some of the most deformable inorganic materials, with bending stiffnesses approaching those of lipid bilayers. Achieving 2D heterostructures with similar properties would enable a new class of deformable devices orders of magnitude softer than conventional thin&#8208;film electronics. Here, by systematically introducing low&#8208;friction twisted or heterointerfaces, interfacial engineering is leveraged to tailor the bending stiffness of 2D heterostructures over several hundred percent. A bending model is developed and experimentally validated to predict and design the deformability of 2D heterostructures and how it evolves with the composition of the stack, the atomic arrangements at the interfaces, and the geometry of the structure. Notably, when each atomic layer is separated by heterointerfaces, the total bending stiffness reaches a theoretical minimum, equal to the sum of the constituent layers regardless of scale of deformation&#8212;lending the extreme deformability of 2D monolayers to device&#8208;compatible&#160;multilayers.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Coordination Polymer Nanoparticles with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission for Deep Tumor&#8208;Penetrating Radio&#8208; and Radiodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination polymer nanoparticles constructed from a photosensitizer with aggregation&#8208;induced emission property (AIE PS) and the high&#8208;Z element hafnium (Hf) is fabricated through a solvothermal method. After PEGylation followed by bioorthogonal click chemistry, Hf&#8208;AIE&#8208;PEG&#8208;DBCO (PEG: poly(ethylene glycol); DBCO: dibenzocyclooctyne) can react on the surface of tumor cells to realize deep tumor&#8208;penetrating radiotherapy and radiodynamic therapy with enhanced tumor accumulation and extended tumor retention.








Abstract
Radiodynamic therapy (RDT), an emerging therapeutic approach for cancer treatment by employing ionizing irradiation to induce localized photodynamic therapy (PDT) can overcome the drawbacks of the limited penetration depth for traditional PDT and the unconcentrated energy in the tumor for traditional radiotherapy (RT). Taking advantage of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizers with bright fluorescence and efficient singlet oxygen production in the aggregate state, Hf&#8208;AIE coordination polymer nanoparticles (CPNs), which show both strong RT and RDT effect under X&#8208;ray irradiation, are developed. Furthermore, to enhance the tumor accumulation and prolong the tumor retention of the CPNs, bioorthogonal click chemistry is applied in the system through coupling between dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)&#8208;modified CPNs (Hf&#8208;AIE&#8208;PEG&#8208;DBCO) (PEG: poly(ethylene glycol)) and azide groups on the cell membrane formed by metabolic glycoengineering. Thanks to the high penetration of X&#8208;ray irradiation, the bioorthogonal&#8208;assisted RT and RDT combination therapy realizes significant killing of cancer cells without showing noticeable biotoxicity after intravenous administration of CPNs.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Responsive Antibiotic&#8208;Loaded Nanoparticle Specifically Binds Pathogens and Overcomes Antimicrobial&#8208;Resistant Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dextran&#8208;coated polymeric nanoparticle is developed to target and eliminate antimicrobial&#8208;resistant pathogens. The NP can bind to lectins expressed by bacteria and accumulate in the infected tissues, releasing the antimicrobial in response to the inflammatory microenvironment, and overcoming antimicrobial resistance. The NP can eliminate biofilm and intracellular infections, and exhibits remarkable in vivo efficacy in treating antimicrobial&#8208;resistant infections.








Abstract
Antimicrobial resistant (AMR) infections are a growing threat to public health and there is a general lack of development in new antibiotics. Here, a dextran&#8208;coated stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoparticle (NP) that encapsulates the hydrophobic antibiotic, rifampicin, and specifically binds bacteria to overcome AMR infections is reported. The NP shows a strong affinity with a variety of pathogens in vitro and effectively accumulates in the bacterial infected tissues. The NP is activated by either low pH or high reactive oxygen species in the infectious microenvironment, and releases both cationic polymer and rifampicin that display synergistic activity against AMR pathogens. The NP carrier also enables the antibiotic to penetrate both bacterial biofilms and mammalian cells, thus allowing the elimination of biofilm and intracellular infections. The NP formulation demonstrates both safety and efficacy in two animal infection models against either Gram&#8208;negative or Gram&#8208;positive AMR pathogens.

         <title>Two&#8208;Photon Polymerization of Nanocomposites for the Fabrication of Transparent Fused Silica Glass Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;resolution 3D printing of photocurable silica nanocomposites using two&#8208;photon direct laser writing is presented. The nanocomposites are consecutively debound and sintered to high&#8208;quality fused silica microstructures with optical surface roughness.








Abstract
Fused silica glass is the material of choice for many high&#8208;performance components in optics due to its high optical transparency combined with its high thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability. Especially, the generation of fused silica microstructures is of high interest for microoptical and biomedical applications. Direct laser writing (DLW) is a suitable technique for generating such devices, as it enables nearly arbitrary structuring down to the sub&#8208;micrometer level. In this work, true 3D structuring of transparent fused silica glass using DLW with tens of micrometer resolution and a surface roughness of Ra&#160;&#8776; 6&#160;nm is demonstrated. The process uses a two&#8208;photon curable silica nanocomposite resin that can be structured by DLW, with the printout being convertible to transparent fused silica glass via thermal debinding and sintering. This technology will enable a plethora of applications from next&#8208;generation optics and photonics to microfluidic and biomedical applications with resolutions on the scale of tens of micrometers.

         <title>Materials Screening for Disorder&#8208;Controlled Chalcogenide Crystals for Phase&#8208;Change Memory Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ab initio simulations and transport experiments elucidate why Sb2Te3 can form an insulating rocksalt structure, extending the exploration of Anderson insulators to binary chalcogenides. A systematic computational screening over binary and ternary chalcogenides, which leads to an in&#8208;depth understanding of the critical factors that affect the stability of the rocksalt structure is also carried out.








Abstract
Tailoring the degree of disorder in chalcogenide phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) plays an essential role in nonvolatile memory devices and neuro&#8208;inspired computing. Upon rapid crystallization from the amorphous phase, the flagship Ge&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te PCMs form metastable rocksalt&#8208;like structures with an unconventionally high concentration of vacancies, which results in disordered crystals exhibiting Anderson&#8208;insulating transport behavior. Here, ab initio simulations and transport experiments are combined to extend these concepts to the parent compound of Ge&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te alloys, viz., binary Sb2Te3, in the metastable rocksalt&#8208;type modification. Then a systematic computational screening over a wide range of homologous, binary and ternary chalcogenides, elucidating the critical factors that affect the stability of the rocksalt structure is carried out. The findings vastly expand the family of disorder&#8208;controlled main&#8208;group chalcogenides toward many more compositions with a tunable bandgap size for demanding phase&#8208;change applications, as well as a varying strength of spin&#8211;orbit interaction for the exploration of potential topological Anderson insulators.

         <title>Synthetic Kramers Pair in Phononic Elastic Plates and Helical Edge States on a Dislocation Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The topological origin of the &#8220;zone&#8208;folding&#8221; phononic topological insulator is revealed and its interpretation as an analog to the quantum spin Hall effect is shown to present key differences in comparison with its electronic counterpart. Also, the possibility of realizing two counter&#8208;propagating gapless helical edge states on a dislocation interface connecting two subdomains with bulk pattern identical up to a relative translation is shown.








Abstract
In conventional theories, topological band properties are intrinsic characteristics of the bulk material and do not depend on the choice of the reference frame. In this scenario, the principle of bulk&#8208;edge correspondence can be used to predict the existence of edge states between topologically distinct materials. In this study, a 2D elastic phononic plate is proposed with a Kekul&#233;&#8208;distorted honeycomb pattern engraved on it. It is found that the pseudospin and the pseudospin&#8208;dependent Chern numbers are not invariant properties, and the &#8484;2 number is no longer a sufficient indicator to examine the existence of the edge state. The distinctive pseudospin texture and the pseudomagnetic field are also revealed. Finally, the synthetic helical edge states are successfully devised and experimentally implemented on a dislocation interface connecting two subdomains with bulk pattern identical up to a relative translation. The edge state is also imaged via laser&#160;vibrometry.

         <title>Hybrid 0D Antimony Halides as Air&#8208;Stable Luminophores for High&#8208;Spatial&#8208;Resolution Remote Thermography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent organic&#8211;inorganic low&#8208;dimensional ns2 metal halides are increasingly explored as thermal phosphors for high&#8208;resolution remote thermography and thermometry due to the high thermal sensitivity of their radiative lifetime. Thin films of such hybrids, conformally coating the surface of interest, can map the temperature with a spatial precision as high as 1 &#956;m using fluorescence&#8208;lifetime imaging.








Abstract
Luminescent organic&#8211;inorganic low&#8208;dimensional ns2 metal halides are of rising interest as thermographic phosphors. The intrinsic nature of the excitonic self&#8208;trapping provides for reliable temperature sensing due to the existence of a temperature range, typically 50&#8211;100 K wide, in which the luminescence lifetimes (and quantum yields) are steeply temperature&#8208;dependent. This sensitivity range can be adjusted from cryogenic temperatures to above room temperature by structural engineering, thus enabling diverse thermometric and thermographic applications ranging from protein crystallography to diagnostics in microelectronics. Owing to the stable oxidation state of Sb3+, Sb(III)&#8208;based halides are far more attractive than all major non&#8208;heavy&#8208;metal alternatives (Sn&#8208;, Ge&#8208;, Bi&#8208;based halides). In this work, the relationship between the luminescence characteristics and crystal structure and microstructure of TPP2SbBr5 (TPP = tetraphenylphosphonium) is established, and then its potential is showcased as environmentally stable and robust phosphor for remote thermography. The material is easily processable into thin films, which is highly beneficial for high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution remote thermography. In particular, a compelling combination of high spatial resolution (1&#160;&#181;m) and high thermometric precision (high specific sensitivities of 0.03&#8211;0.04 K&#8722;1) is demonstrated by fluorescence&#8208;lifetime imaging of a heated resistive pattern on a flat substrate, covered with a solution&#8208;spun film of TPP2SbBr5.

         <title>Strong Chemical Interaction between Lithium Polysulfides and Flame&#8208;Retardant Polyphosphazene for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries with Enhanced Safety and Electrochemical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a flame&#8208;retardant interlayer for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, polyphosphazene (PPZ) covalently modified holey graphene/carbonized cellulose paper can not only increase the electrochemical performance via strong chemical interaction between components, but also improves the safety of batteries due to the high and low temperature resistance property as well as the good flame&#8208;retardant characteristics of PPZ.








Abstract
The shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPS) and potential safety hazard caused by the burning of flammable organic electrolytes, sulfur cathode, and lithium anode seriously limit the practical application of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Here, a flame&#8208;retardant polyphosphazene (PPZ) covalently modified holey graphene/carbonized cellulose paper is reported as a multifunctional interlayer in Li&#8211;S batteries. During the discharge/charge process, once the LiPS are generated, the as&#8208;obtained flame&#8208;retardant interlayer traps them immediately through the nucleophilic substitution reaction between PPZ and LiPS, effectively inhibiting the shuttling effect of LiPS to enhance the cycle stability of Li&#8211;S batteries. Meanwhile, this strong chemical interaction increases the diffusion coefficient for lithium ions, accelerating the lithiation reaction with complete inversion. Moreover, the as&#8208;obtained interlayer can be used as a fresh 3D current collector to establish a flame&#8208;retardant &#8220;vice&#8208;electrode,&#8221; which can trap dissolved sulfur and absorb a large amount of electrolyte, prominently bringing down the flammability of the sulfur cathode and electrolyte to improve the safety of Li&#8211;S batteries. This work provides a viable strategy for using PPZ&#8208;based materials as strong chemical scavengers for LiPS and a flame&#8208;retardant interlayer toward next&#8208;generation Li&#8211;S batteries with enhanced safety and electrochemical performance.

         <title>Ultrathin and Conformable Lead Halide Perovskite Photodetector Arrays for Potential Application in Retina&#8208;Like Vision Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin lead halide perovskite photodetector arrays with a thickness of 2.4&#160;&#181;m are fabricated based on patterned all&#8208;inorganic CsPbBr3 films. The device with excellent flexibility and conformal contact characteristics shows robust mechanical stability under bending or compressive strain. More importantly, it conforms to a hemispherical support realizing imaging of the light distribution, indicating potential applications in retina&#8208;like vision sensing.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed lead halide perovskites are considered one of the promising materials for flexible optoelectronics. However, the array integration of ultrathin flexible perovskite photodetectors (PDs) remains a significant challenge limited by the incompatibility of perovskite materials with manufacturing techniques involving polar liquids. Here, an ultrathin (2.4&#160;&#181;m) and conformable perovskite&#8208;based PD array (10 &#215; 10 pixels) with ultralight weight (3.12&#160;g m&#8722;2) and excellent flexibility, is reported. Patterned all&#8208;inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite films with precise pixel position, controllable morphology, and homogenous dimension, are synthesized by a vacuum&#8208;assisted drop&#8208;casting patterning process as the active layer. The use of waterproof parylene&#8208;C film as substrate and encapsulation layer effectively protects the perovskite films against penetration of polar liquids during the peeling&#8208;off process. Benefitting from the encapsulation and ultrathin property, the device exhibits long&#8208;term stability in the ambient environment, and robust mechanical stability under bending or 50% compressive strain. More importantly, the ultrathin flexible PD arrays conforming to hemispherical support realize imaging of light distribution, indicating the potential applications in retina&#8208;like vision sensing.

         <title>Two&#8208;Photon Polymerization: Two&#8208;Photon Polymerization of Nanocomposites for the Fabrication of Transparent Fused Silica Glass Microstructures (Adv. Mater. 9/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glass is one of the most important materials for optical applications but it is difficult to shape on the microscale. In article number 2006341, Frederik Kotz and co&#8208;workers present two&#8208;photon polymerization of nanocomposites, which are subsequently converted to transparent fused silica glass. The cover shows a glass microtower fabricated by this process.

         <title>Fused Aromatic Network Structures: Fused Aromatic Network with Exceptionally High Carrier Mobility (Adv. Mater. 9/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2004707, Joon Hak Oh, Jong&#8208;Beom Baek, and co&#8208;workers report the design and synthesis of fused aromatic network structures with C5N basal plane stoichiometry. Thin films cast onto silicon dioxide substrates from the C5N solution exhibit ambipolar charge transport and extraordinary high electron and hole mobilities in field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) devices, superior to the performance of most pristine organic materials without doping.

         <title>2D Materials: Designing the Bending Stiffness of 2D Material Heterostructures (Adv. Mater. 9/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single graphene sheet is stacked on top of monolayer MoS2. The 2D heterostructure is buckled out&#8208;of&#8208;plane, inducing bending in both layers. In article number 2007269, Arend M. van der Zande, Pinshane Y. Huang, and co&#8208;workers study the impact of interfacial engineering on the tunability of the bending stiffness in 2D multilayers. A bending model is developed to predict and design the deformability of any arbitrary 2D heterostructure.

         <title>Design, Fabrication, and Mechanism of Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Graphene&#8208;Based Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene plays a significant role in photocatalysis. Rational design, preparation, and understanding the mechanism of N&#8208;doped graphene&#8208;based photocatalysts provides a new opportunity to further enhance the photocatalytic performance. The research progress, atomic and band structures, photocatalytic mechanism, synthesis strategy, unique advantages, and wide application of N&#8208;doped graphene in photocatalysis are highlighted.








Abstract
Solving energy and environmental problems through solar&#8208;driven photocatalysis is an attractive and challenging topic. Hence, various types of photocatalysts have been developed successively to address the demands of photocatalysis. Graphene&#8208;based materials have elicited considerable attention since the discovery of graphene. As a derivative of graphene, nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (NG) particularly stands out. Nitrogen atoms can break the undifferentiated structure of graphene and open the bandgap while endowing graphene with an uneven electron density distribution. Therefore, NG retains nearly all the advantages of original graphene and is equipped with several novel properties, ensuring infinite possibilities for NG&#8208;based photocatalysis. This review introduces the atomic and band structures of NG, summarizes in situ and ex situ synthesis methods, highlights the mechanism and advantages of NG in photocatalysis, and outlines its applications in different photocatalysis directions (primarily hydrogen production, CO2 reduction, pollutant degradation, and as photoactive ingredient). Lastly, the central challenges and possible improvements of NG&#8208;based photocatalysis in the future are presented. This study is expected to learn from the past and achieve progress toward the future for NG&#8208;based photocatalysis.

&lt;p&gt;Nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene plays a significant role in photocatalysis. Rational design, preparation, and understanding the mechanism of N&#8208;doped graphene&#8208;based photocatalysts provides a new opportunity to further enhance the photocatalytic performance. The research progress, atomic and band structures, photocatalytic mechanism, synthesis strategy, unique advantages, and wide application of N&#8208;doped graphene in photocatalysis are highlighted.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solving energy and environmental problems through solar&#8208;driven photocatalysis is an attractive and challenging topic. Hence, various types of photocatalysts have been developed successively to address the demands of photocatalysis. Graphene&#8208;based materials have elicited considerable attention since the discovery of graphene. As a derivative of graphene, nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (NG) particularly stands out. Nitrogen atoms can break the undifferentiated structure of graphene and open the bandgap while endowing graphene with an uneven electron density distribution. Therefore, NG retains nearly all the advantages of original graphene and is equipped with several novel properties, ensuring infinite possibilities for NG&#8208;based photocatalysis. This review introduces the atomic and band structures of NG, summarizes in situ and ex situ synthesis methods, highlights the mechanism and advantages of NG in photocatalysis, and outlines its applications in different photocatalysis directions (primarily hydrogen production, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, pollutant degradation, and as photoactive ingredient). Lastly, the central challenges and possible improvements of NG&#8208;based photocatalysis in the future are presented. This study is expected to learn from the past and achieve progress toward the future for NG&#8208;based photocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Liquid Metals: A Novel Possibility of Fabricating 2D Metal Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in the fabrication of 2D metal oxides (2DMOs) via liquid metals are comprehensively reviewed. The introduction of progress in fabricating 2DMOs by virtue of the features of liquid metals improves diversity in the development and applications of 2DMOs. The current challenges concerning the fabrication of 2DMOs are discussed to promote future research.








Abstract
2D metal oxides (2DMOs) have been widely applied in the fields of electronic, magnetic, optical, and catalytic materials, owing to their rich surface chemistry and unique electronic structures. However, their further development faces challenges such as the difficulty in fabricating 2DMOs with unstable surface induced by strong surface polarizability, or the high cost and limited yield of the fabrication process. Recently, liquid metals have shown great potential in the fabrication of 2DMOs. The native oxide skin formed on the surface of liquid metals can be considered as a perfect 2D planar material. Due to the solubility, fluidity, and reactivity of liquid metals, they can act as the solvent, reactant, and interface in the fabrication of 2DMOs. Moreover, liquid metals undergo a liquid&#8211;solid phase transition, enabling them to be a symmetric matched substrate for growing high&#8208;quality 2DMOs. An insightful survey of the recent progress in this research direction is presented. The features of liquid metals including good solubility, chemical reactivity, weak interface force, and liquid&#8211;solid phase transitions are introduced in detail. Furthermore, strategies for the fabrication of 2DMOs by virtue of these features are summarized comprehensively. Finally, current challenges and prospects regarding the future development in the fabrication of 2DMOs via liquid metals are highlighted.

         <title>MnO2&#8208;Based Materials for Environmental Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent experimental and computational research progress on modulation of MnO2 single&#8208;species and MnO2&#8208;based composites for environmental applications are summarized. MnO2 single&#8208;species can be modified through morphology control, structure construction, facet engineering, and element doping while MnO2&#8208;based composites can be tuned by construction of homojunctions, MnO2/semiconductor/conductor binary heterojunctions, and MnO2&#8208;based ternary heterojunctions.








Abstract
Manganese dioxide (MnO2) is a promising photo&#8211;thermo&#8211;electric&#8208;responsive semiconductor material for environmental applications, owing to its various favorable properties. However, the unsatisfactory environmental purification efficiency of this material has limited its further applications. Fortunately, in the last few years, significant efforts have been undertaken for improving the environmental purification efficiency of this material and understanding its underlying mechanism. Here, the aim is to summarize the recent experimental and computational research progress in the modification of MnO2 single species by morphology control, structure construction, facet engineering, and element doping. Moreover, the design and fabrication of MnO2&#8208;based composites via the construction of homojunctions and MnO2/semiconductor/conductor binary/ternary heterojunctions is discussed. Their applications in environmental purification systems, either as an adsorbent material for removing heavy metals, dyes, and microwave (MW) pollution, or as a thermal catalyst, photocatalyst, and electrocatalyst for the degradation of pollutants (water and gas, organic and inorganic) are also highlighted. Finally, the research gaps are summarized and a perspective on the challenges and the direction of future research in nanostructured MnO2&#8208;based materials in the field of environmental applications is presented. Therefore, basic guidance for rational design and fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency MnO2&#8208;based materials for comprehensive environmental applications is provided.

         <title>A Brief History of OLEDs&#8212;Emitter Development and Industry Milestones</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The history of emitter development and industry's interest in organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) technology are reviewed. OLED device technology has equally inspired and driven innovation in academia and industry. Three generations of emitters based on different emission mechanisms have been designed. Recently, research in both academia and industry points toward a fourth generation of light&#8208;emitting materials for OLEDs.








Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) have come a long way ever since their first introduction in 1987 at Eastman Kodak. Today, OLEDs are especially valued in the display and lighting industry for their promising features. As one of the research fields that equally inspires and drives development in academia and industry, OLED device technology has continuously evolved over more than 30&#160;years. OLED devices have come forward based on three generations of emitter materials relying on fluorescence (first generation), phosphorescence (second generation), and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (third generation). Furthermore, research in academia and industry toward the fourth generation of OLEDs is in progress. Excerpts from the history of green, orange&#8208;red, and blue OLED emitter development on the side of academia and milestones achieved by key players in the industry are included in this report.

         <title>RhSe2: A Superior 3D Electrocatalyst with Multiple Active Facets for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Both Acid and Alkaline Solutions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D structured transition metal sulfide, RhSe2, is synthesized, which exhibits high electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction in both acid and alkaline electrolyte.








Abstract
Layered 2D materials are a vital class of electrocatalys for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), due to their large area, excellent activity, and facile fabrication. Theoretical caculations domenstrate, however, that only the edges of the 2D nanosheets act as active sites, while the much larger basal plane exhibits passive activity. Here, from a distinguishing perspective, RhSe2 is reported as a &#8220;3D&#8221; electrocatalyst for HER with top&#8208;class activity, synthesized by a facile solid&#8208;state method. Superior to 2D materials, multiple crystal facets of RhSe2 exhibit near&#8208;zero free energy change of hydrogen adsorption (&#916;GH), which guarantees high performance in most common morphologies. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the low&#8208;coordinated Rh atoms act as the active sites in acid, which enables the modified Kubas&#8208;mediated pathway, while the Se atoms act as the active sites in an alkaline medium. The overpotentials of HER activity of RhSe2 are measured to be 49.9 and 81.6&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 in acid and alkaline solutions, respectively. This work paves the way to new transition metal chalcogenide catalysts.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous carbon&#8208;doped anatase TiOx (C&#8208;TiOx) nanosheet with controllable Ti3+ concentration is prepared by a reproducible bottom&#8208;up strategy. The optimal C&#8208;TiOx with high&#8208;concentration Ti3+ exhibits a NH3 production rate of 109.3 &#181;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 under visible&#8208;light irradiation and a remarkable apparent quantum efficiency of 1.1% at 400&#160;nm, the highest compared with all previously reported TiO2&#8208;based photocatalysts.








Abstract
Photocatalytic ammonia synthesis is exciting but quite challenging with a very moderate yield at present. One of the greatest challenges is to develop highly active centers in a photocatalyst for N2 reduction under ambient conditions. Herein, porous carbon&#8208;doped anatase TiOx (C&#8208;TiOx) nanosheets with high&#8208;concentration active sites of Ti3+ are presented, which are produced by layered Ti3SiC2 through a reproducible bottom&#8208;up approach. It is shown that the high&#8208;concentration Ti3+ sites are the major species for the significant increase in N2 photoreduction activity by the C&#8208;TiOx. Such bottom&#8208;up substitutional doping of C into TiO2 is responsible for both visible absorption and generation of Ti3+ concentration. Together with the porous nanosheets morphology and the loading of a Ru/RuO2 nanosized cocatalyst for enhanced charge separation and transfer, the optimal C&#8208;TiOx with a Ti3+/Ti4+ ratio of 72.1% shows a high NH3 production rate of 109.3 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under visible&#8208;light irradiation and a remarkable apparent quantum efficiency of 1.1% at 400&#160;nm, which is the highest compared to all TiO2&#8208;based photocatalysts at present.

         <title>Non&#8208;Solvent Induced Phase Separation Enables Designer Redox Flow Battery Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;solvent induced phase separation is introduced as a versatile and facile method to synthesize redox flow battery electrodes with hierarchical microstructures unachievable via conventional manufacturing approaches. Flow cell studies reveal that the novel materials can outperform conventional carbon fiber electrodes owing to better mass transfer and higher surface area, demonstrating that this method may enable new classes of porous electrodes tailored for particular electrochemical flow technologies.








Abstract
Porous carbonaceous electrodes are performance&#8208;defining components in redox flow batteries (RFBs), where their properties impact the efficiency, cost, and durability of the system. The overarching challenge is to simultaneously fulfill multiple seemingly contradictory requirements&#8212;i.e., high surface area, low pressure drop, and facile mass transport&#8212;without sacrificing scalability or manufacturability. Here, non&#8208;solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) is proposed as a versatile method to synthesize tunable porous structures suitable for use as RFB electrodes. The variation of the relative concentration of scaffold&#8208;forming polyacrylonitrile to pore&#8208;forming poly(vinylpyrrolidone) is demonstrated to result in electrodes with distinct microstructure and porosity. Tomographic microscopy, porosimetry, and spectroscopy are used to characterize the 3D structure and surface chemistry. Flow cell studies with two common redox species (i.e., all&#8208;vanadium and Fe2+/3+) reveal that the novel electrodes can outperform traditional carbon fiber electrodes. It is posited that the bimodal porous structure, with interconnected large (&gt;50 &#181;m) macrovoids in the through&#8208;plane direction and smaller (&lt;5 &#181;m) pores throughout, provides a favorable balance between offsetting traits. Although nascent, the NIPS synthesis approach has the potential to serve as a technology platform for the development of porous electrodes specifically designed to enable electrochemical flow technologies.

         <title>Whole&#8208;Voltage&#8208;Range Oxygen Redox in P2&#8208;Layered Cathode Materials for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na0.7Mg0.2[Fe0.2Mn0.6&#9633;0.2]O2 with native transitional metal (TM) vacancies is designed as a novel cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The TM vacancies lead to nonbonding O 2p orbitals in this material, pointing toward these vacancies triggering reversible whole&#8208;voltage&#8208;range oxygen redox during charge and discharge processes. This work provides new ideals for design of cathode materials in anionic redox chemistry.








Abstract
Oxygen&#8208;redox of layer&#8208;structured metal&#8208;oxide cathodes has drawn great attention as an effective approach to break through the bottleneck of their capacity limit. However, reversible oxygen&#8208;redox can only be obtained in the high&#8208;voltage region (usually over 3.5 V) in current metal&#8208;oxide cathodes. Here, we realize reversible oxygen&#8208;redox in a wide voltage range of 1.5&#8211;4.5 V in a P2&#8208;layered Na0.7Mg0.2[Fe0.2Mn0.6&#9633;0.2]O2 cathode material, where intrinsic vacancies are located in transition&#8208;metal (TM) sites and Mg&#8208;ions are located in Na sites. Mg&#8208;ions in the Na layer serve as &#8220;pillars&#8221; to stabilize the layered structure during electrochemical cycling, especially in the high&#8208;voltage region. Intrinsic vacancies in the TM layer create the local configurations of &#8220;&#9633;&#8211;O&#8211;&#9633;&#8221;, &#8220;Na&#8211;O&#8211;&#9633;&#8221; and &#8220;Mg&#8211;O&#8211;&#9633;&#8221; to trigger oxygen&#8208;redox in the whole voltage range of charge&#8211;discharge. Time&#8208;resolved techniques demonstrate that the P2 phase is well maintained in a wide potential window range of 1.5&#8211;4.5 V even at 10 C. It is revealed that charge compensation from Mn&#8208; and O&#8208;ions contributes to the whole voltage range of 1.5&#8211;4.5 V, while the redox of Fe&#8208;ions only contributes to the high&#8208;voltage region of 3.0&#8211;4.5 V. The orphaned electrons in the nonbonding 2p orbitals of O that point toward TM&#8208;vacancy sites are responsible for reversible oxygen&#8208;redox, and Mg&#8208;ions in Na sites suppress oxygen release effectively.

A plasmonic modulation strategy of gold nanorods through manganese dioxide coating is explored for activatable photoacoustic/magnetic resonance duplex&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided photothermal&#8208;chemodynamic therapy in the second near&#8208;infrared window.








Abstract
Nanotheranostic agents of gold nanomaterials in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window have attracted significant attention in cancer management, owing to the reduced background signal and deeper penetration depth in tissues. However, it is still challenging to modulate the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of gold nanomaterials from the first near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;I) to NIR&#8208;II region. Herein, a plasmonic modulation strategy of gold nanorods (GNRs) through manganese dioxide coating is developed for NIR&#8208;II photoacoustic/magnetic resonance (MR) duplex&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided NIR&#8208;II photothermal chemodynamic therapy. GNRs are coated with silica dioxide (SiO2) and then covered with magnesium dioxide (MnO2) to obtain the final product of GNR@SiO2@MnO2 (denoted as GSM). The LSPR peak of GNRs could be tuned by adjusting the thickness of the MnO2 layer. Theoretical simulations reveal that this plasmonic modulation is mainly due to the change of refraction index around the GNRs after coating with the MnO2 layer. Additionally, the MnO2 layer is demonstrated to degrade into Mn2+ ions in response to peroxide and acidic protons in the tumor microenvironment, which allows for MR imaging and chemodynamic therapy. This plasmonic modulation strategy can be adapted to other metal nanomaterials and the construction of a new class of NIR&#8208;II nanotheranostics.

         <title>Engineering the Optical Emission and Robustness of Metal&#8208;Halide Layered Perovskites through Ligand Accommodation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The organic component in 2D layered perovskites can grant access to many possibilities for material design, in view of the rich variety. This work shows how the choice of the structure and chain length of organic cations can effectively guide the precise design of the emission color and efficiency of such versatile nanomaterials.








Abstract
The unique combination of organic and inorganic layers in 2D layered perovskites offers promise for the design of a variety of materials for mechatronics, flexoelectrics, energy conversion, and lighting. However, the potential tailoring of their properties through the organic building blocks is not yet well understood. Here, different classes of organoammonium molecules are exploited to engineer the optical emission and robustness of a new set of Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper metal&#8208;halide layered perovskites. It is shown that the type of molecule regulates the number of hydrogen bonds that it forms with the edge&#8208;sharing [PbBr6]4&#8208; octahedra layers, leading to strong differences in the material emission and tunability of the color coordinates, from deep&#8208;blue to pure&#8208;white. Also, the emission intensity strongly depends on the length of the molecules, thereby providing an additional parameter to optimize their emission efficiency. The combined experimental and computational study provides a detailed understanding of the impact of lattice distortions, compositional defects, and the anisotropic crystal structure on the emission of such layered materials. It is foreseen that this rational design can be extended to other types of organic linkers, providing a yet unexplored path to tailor the optical and mechanical properties of these materials and to unlock new functionalities.

         <title>Fabrication of Quasi&#8208;2D Shape&#8208;Tailored Microparticles using Wettability Contrast&#8208;Based Platforms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thin polymeric films with well&#8208;defined lateral size and geometry are fabricated taking advantage of the wettability contrast of oleophilic&#8211;oleophobic patterned surfaces. Cells mediate the pliability of quasi&#8208;2D films, and their integration in 3D cellular aggregates leads to enhanced cell metabolic activity and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor.








Abstract
The ability to fabricate materials with ultrathin architectures enables the breakthrough of low&#8208;dimensional structures with high surface area that showcase distinctive properties from their bulk counterparts. They are exploited in a wide range of fields, including energy harvesting, catalysis, and biomedicine. Despite such versatility, the fine tuning of the lateral dimensions and geometry of these structures remains challenging. Prepatterned platforms gain significant attention as enabling technologies to process materials with highly controlled shapes and dimensions. Herein, different nanometer&#8208;thick particles of various lateral sizes and geometries (e.g., squares, circles, triangles, hexagons) are processed with high precision and definition, taking advantage of the wettability contrast of oleophilic&#8211;oleophobic patterned surfaces. Quasi&#8208;2D polymeric microparticles with high shape&#8208; and size&#8208;fidelity can be retrieved as freestanding objects in a single step. These structures show cell&#8208;mediated pliability, and their integration in gravity&#8208;enforced human adipose&#8208;derived stem cell spheroids leads to an enhanced metabolic activity and a modulated secretion of proangiogenic factors.

         <title>Biologically Plausible Artificial Synaptic Array: Replicating Ebbinghaus&#8217; Memory Curve with Selective Attention</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the memorization process of the human brain, an artificial synaptic array is developed, which mimics the biological memorization process by replicating Ebbinghaus&#8217; forgetting curve. To construct the artificial synaptic array, signal&#8208;transmitting access transistors and artificial synaptic memory transistors are designed using indium&#8211;gallium&#8211;zinc&#8208;oxide and poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene), respectively.








Abstract
The nature of repetitive learning and oblivion of memory enables humans to effectively manage vast amounts of memory by prioritizing information for long&#8208;term storage. Inspired by the memorization process of the human brain, an artificial synaptic array is presented, which mimics the biological memorization process by replicating Ebbinghaus&#8217; forgetting curve. To construct the artificial synaptic array, signal&#8208;transmitting access transistors and artificial synaptic memory transistors are designed using indium&#8211;gallium&#8211;zinc&#8208;oxide and poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene), respectively. To secure the desired performance of the access transistor in regulating the input signal to the synaptic transistor, the content of gallium in the access transistor is optimized. In addition, the operation voltage of the synaptic transistor is carefully selected to achieve memory&#8208;state efficiency. Repetitive learning characterizing Ebbinghaus&#8217; oblivion curves is realized using an artificial synaptic array with optimized conditions for both transistor components. This successfully demonstrates a biologically plausible memorization process. Furthermore, selective attention for information prioritization in the human brain is mimicked by selectively applying repetitive learning to a synaptic transistor with a high memory state. The demonstrated biologically plausible artificial synaptic array provides great scope for advancement in bioinspired electronics.

         <title>Engineered Extracellular Vesicles for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are excellent delivery vehicles for various therapeutic agents. EVs are engineered to improve their efficiency, specificity, and safety for cancer therapy. A comprehensive overview of advanced strategies for engineering EVs is given. Additionally, potential applications of engineered EVs in cancer therapy and the challenges for translating them into clinical practice are discussed.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as a novel cell&#8208;free strategy for the treatment of many diseases including cancer. As a result of their natural properties to mediate cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell communication and their high physiochemical stability and biocompatibility, EVs are considered as excellent delivery vehicles for a variety of therapeutic agents such as nucleic acids and proteins, drugs, and nanomaterials. Increasing studies have shown that EVs can be modified, engineered, or designed to improve their efficiency, specificity, and safety for cancer therapy. Herein, a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in the strategies and methodologies of engineering EVs for scalable production and improved cargo&#8208;loading and tumor&#8208;targeting is provided. Additionally, the potential applications of engineered EVs in cancer therapy are discussed by presenting prominent examples, and the opportunities and challenges for translating engineered EVs into clinical practice are evaluated.

         <title>2D Homojunctions for Electronics and Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The booming development of 2D homojunctions has received tremendous attention over the past years. The recent research progress on the construction strategies and device applications in electronics and optoelectronics are comprehensively summarized.








Abstract
In the post&#8208;Moore era, 2D materials with rich physical properties have attracted widespread attention from the scientific and industrial communities. Among 2D materials, the 2D homojunctions are of great promise in designing novel electronic and optoelectronic devices due to their unique geometries and properties such as homogeneous components, perfect lattice matching, and efficient charge transfer at the interface. In this article, a pioneering review focusing on the structural design and device application of 2D homojunctions such as p&#8211;n homojunctions, heterophase homojunctions, and layer&#8208;engineered homojunctions is provided. The preparation strategies to construct 2D homojunctions including vapor&#8208;phase deposition, lithium intercalation, laser irradiation, chemical doping, electrostatic doping, and photodoping are summarized in detail. Specifically, a careful review on the applications of the 2D homojunctions in electronics (e.g., field&#8208;effect transistors, rectifiers, and inverters) and optoelectronics (e.g., light&#8208;emitting diodes, photovoltaics, and photodetectors) is provided. Eventually, the current challenges and future perspectives are commented for promoting the rapid development of 2D homojunctions.

         <title>A Polymer Multicellular Nanoengager for Synergistic NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semiconducting polymer nanoengager (SPNE) with both tumor&#8208;associated antigens and T cell stimulating factors is designed to elicit potent multicellular engagement among tumor cells and immunocytes, enabling dual vaccination effects on both dendritic cells and T cells. Thus, the SPNE mediates synergistic second&#8208;near&#8208;infrared&#8208;window (NIR&#8208;II) photothermal immunotherapy that efficiently inhibits tumor growth and metastasis.








Abstract
Cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles (CCNPs) that integrate the biophysiological advantages of cell membranes with the multifunctionalities of synthetic materials hold great promise in cancer immunotherapy. However, strategies have yet to be revealed to further improve their immunotherapeutic efficacy. Herein, a polymer multicellular nanoengager (SPNE) for synergistic second&#8208;near&#8208;infrared&#8208;window (NIR&#8208;II) photothermal immunotherapy is reported. The nanoengager consists of an NIR&#8208;II absorbing polymer as the photothermal core, which is camouflaged with fused membranes derived from immunologically engineered tumor cells and dendritic cells (DCs) as the cancer vaccine shell. In association with the high accumulation in lymph nodes and tumors, the multicellular engagement ability of the SPNE enables effective cross&#8208;interactions among tumor cells, DCs, and T cells, leading to augmented T cell activation relative to bare or tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;coated nanoparticles. Upon deep&#8208;tissue penetrating NIR&#8208;II photoirradiation, SPNE eradicates the tumor and induces immunogenic cell death, further eliciting anti&#8208;tumor T cell immunity. Such a synergistic photothermal immunotherapeutic effect eventually inhibits tumor growth, prevents metastasis and procures immunological memory. Thus, this study presents a general cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coating approach to develop photo&#8208;immunotherapeutic agents for cancer therapy.

         <title>Mimicking Nature's Butterflies: Electrochromic Devices with Dual&#8208;Sided Differential Colorations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Janus&#8208;structured electrochromic devices are evolved from traditional electrochromic structures by inserting an optically thin (4&#8211;8 nm) metallic layer with&#160;complex refractive index. These unique differentially colored devices are used to mimick the butterfly Kallima inachus, which closely resembles a dry leaf when its wings are close and exhibits various bright colors when its wings are open.








Abstract
Some butterfly species such as the orange oakleaf (Kallima inachus) have strikingly different colors on the dorsal (front) sides of their wings compared to those on the ventral (back) sides of their wings, which helps camouflage the butterflies from predators and attract potential mates. However, few human&#8208;made materials, devices, and technologies can mimic such differential coloring for a long time. Here, a new type of Janus&#8208;structured two&#8208;sided electrochromic device is developed that, upon application of different voltages, exhibits a coloration state on one side that is distinctly different from that on the other side. This is achieved by inserting an optically thin (4&#8211;8 nm) metallic layer with a complex refractive index, such as a layer composed of tungsten, titanium, copper or silver, into typical electrochromic structures.

         <title>Trap Energy Upconversion&#8208;Like Near&#8208;Infrared to Near&#8208;Infrared Light Rejuvenateable Persistent Luminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new paradigm of trap energy upconversion&#8208;like near&#8208;infrared (NIR) to NIR light rejuvenateable persistent luminescence in bismuth&#8208;doped calcium stannate phosphors and nanoparticles is reported. These materials enable the occurrence of a reversed transition of the carriers from a deep&#8208;level energy trap to a shallow&#8208;level trap upon excitation by low&#8208;energy NIR photons. Thus they can be charged circularly via deep&#8208;tissue penetrable NIR photons.








Abstract
Persistent&#8208;luminescence phosphors (PLPs) have a wide variety of applications in the fields of photonics and biophotonics due to their ultralong afterglow lifetime. However, the existing PLPs are charged and recharged with short&#8208;wavelength high&#8208;energy photons or inconvenient and potentially risky X&#8208;ray beams. To date, deep tissue penetrable NIR light has mainly been used for photostimulated afterglow emission, which continues to decay and weaken after each cycle, Herein, a new paradigm of trap energy upconversion&#8208;like near&#8208;infrared (NIR) to near&#8208;infrared light rejuvenateable persistent luminescence in bismuth&#8208;doped calcium stannate phosphors and nanoparticles is reported. In contrast to the existing PLPs and persistent&#8208;luminescence nanoparticles, the materials enable the occurrence of a reversed transition of the carriers from a deep&#8208;level energy trap to a shallow&#8208;level trap upon excitation by low&#8208;energy NIR photons. Thus these new materials can be charged circularly via deep&#8208;tissue penetrable NIR photons, which is unable to be done for existing PLPs, and emit afterglow signals. This conceptual work will lay the foundation to design new categories of NIR&#8208;absorptive&#8211;NIR&#8208;emissive PLPs and nanoparticles featuring physically harmless and deep tissue penetrable NIR light renewability and sets the stage for numerous biological applications, which have been limited by current materials.

         <title>Water&#8211;Salt Oligomers Enable Supersoluble Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8211;salt oligomers break through the physical solubility limits of aqueous electrolytes, enabling high&#8208;capacity rechargeable batteries based on zinc&#8211;halogen chemistry. The polymer&#8208;like characters of such electrolytes are confirmed by relatively large molecular&#8208;ion peaks and low glass&#8208;transition temperatures. In situ electrochemical technologies reveal a stage&#8208;1 intercalation of bromine into the graphene cathode during charging, accounting for the high capacity of the assembled batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable batteries are highly safe, low&#8208;cost, and environmentally friendly, but restricted by low energy density. One of the most efficient solutions is to improve the concentration of the aqueous electrolytes. However, each salt is limited by its physical solubility, generally below 21&#8211;32&#160;mol&#160;kg&#8722;1 (m). Here, a ZnCl2/ZnBr2/Zn(OAc)2 aqueous electrolyte with a record super&#8208;solubility up to 75 m is reported, which breaks through the physical solubility limit. This is attributed to the formation of acetate&#8208;capped water&#8211;salt oligomers bridged by Br&#8722;/Cl&#8722;&#8208;H and Br&#8722;/Cl&#8722;/O&#8208;Zn2+ interactions. Mass spectrometry indicates that acetate anions containing nonpolarized protons prohibit the overgrowth and precipitation of ionic oligomers. The polymer&#8208;like glass transition temperature of such inorganic electrolytes is found at &#8776;&#8722;70 to &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C, without the observation of peaks for salt&#8208;crystallization and water&#8208;freezing from 40 to &#8722;80&#160;&#176;C. This supersoluble electrolyte enables high&#8208;performance aqueous dual&#8208;ion batteries that exhibit a reversible capacity of 605.7&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, corresponding to an energy density of 908.5&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1, with a coulombic efficiency of 98.07%. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and Raman technologies reveal that such high ionic concentrations of the supersoluble electrolyte enable a stage&#8208;1 intercalation of bromine into macroscopically assembled graphene cathode.

This supersoluble electrolyte enables high&#8208;performance aqueous dual&#8208;ion batteries that exhibit a reversible capacity of 605.7&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, corresponding to an energy density of 908.5&#160;Wh&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, with a coulombic efficiency of 98.07%. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and Raman technologies reveal that such high ionic concentrations of the supersoluble electrolyte enable a stage&#8208;1 intercalation of bromine into macroscopically assembled graphene cathode.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Programmable Phototaxis of Metal&#8211;Phenolic Particle Microswimmers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic microswimmers with precise light&#8208;driven velocities are engineered with promise for robotics, drug delivery, and environmental applications. Various cargos with distinct spectral absorption profiles can be loaded into the microswimmers to tune the specific wavelengths of light that lead to motion under ultraviolet, blue, green, and orange light.








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven directional motion is common in nature but remains a challenge for synthetic microparticles, particularly regarding collective motion on a macroscopic scale. Successfully engineering microparticles with light&#8208;driven collective motion could lead to breakthroughs in drug delivery, contaminant sensing, environmental remediation, and artificial life. Herein, metal&#8211;phenolic particle microswimmers capable of autonomously sensing and swimming toward an external light source are reported, with the speed regulated by the wavelength and intensity of illumination. These microswimmers can travel macroscopic distances (centimeters) and can remain illuminated for hours without degradation of motility. Experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrate that motion is generated through chemical transformations of the organic component of the metal&#8211;phenolic complex. Furthermore, cargos with specific spectral absorption profiles can be loaded into the particles and endow the particle microswimmers with activated motion corresponding to these spectral characteristics. The programmable nature of the light navigation, tunable size of the particles, and versatility of cargo loading demonstrate the versatility of these metal&#8211;phenolic particle microswimmers.

         <title>Degradable Poly(vinyl alcohol)&#8208;Based Supramolecular Plastics with High Mechanical Strength in a Watery Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Completely degradable and easily processable poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)&#8208;based supramolecular plastics are fabricated by complexation of vanillin&#8208;grafted PVA, hydrophobic humic acid, and Fe3+ ions. In watery environments, the plastics have a mechanical strength similar to that of polyethylene in its dry state. The PVA&#8208;based plastics can completely degrade into nontoxic species after being placed under soil for approximately 108 d.








Abstract
It is challenging to fabricate degradable poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)&#8208;based plastics that can be used in watery environments because PVA is soluble in water. In this study, PVA&#8208;based supramolecular plastics with excellent degradability in soil and high mechanical strength in watery environments are fabricated by the complexation of vanillin&#8208;grafted PVA (VPVA), hydrophobic humic acid (HA), and Fe3+ ions (hereafter denoted as VPVA&#8211;HA&#8211;Fe complexes). Large&#8208;area PVA&#8208;based plastics can be easily prepared from a solution of VPVA&#8211;HA&#8211;Fe complexes using a blade&#8208;coating method. The high&#8208;density of hydrogen bonds and coordination interactions, as well as the reinforcement of self&#8208;assembled Fe3+&#8208;chelated HA nanoparticles, facilitate the fabrication of PVA&#8208;based plastics with a breaking strength of &#8776;85.0&#160;MPa. After immersion in water at room temperature for 7 d, the PVA&#8208;based plastics exhibit a breaking strength of &#8776;26.2&#160;MPa, which is similar to that of polyethylene in its dry state. Furthermore, owing to the reversibility of the hydrogen bonds and coordination interactions, the VPVA&#8211;HA&#8211;Fe plastics are recyclable and can be conveniently processed into plastic products with desired shapes. After being placed under soil for &#8776;108 d, the PVA&#8208;based plastics are completely degraded into nontoxic species without requiring manual interference.

         <title>Reducing Energy Disorder of Hole Transport Layer by Charge Transfer Complex for High Performance p&#8211;i&#8211;n Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charge&#8208;transfer complex strategy to reduce the energy disorder of the organic semiconductor (OS) charge transport layers (CTLs) by doping a well&#8208;designed OS (BDT&#8208;Si) with electron&#8208;acceptor features in a commercial hole&#8208;transport material (PTAA) is proposed. As a result, the p&#8211;i&#8211;n planar perovskite solar cells with the optimized hole&#8208;transport layer exhibit the best power conversion efficiency of 21.87%, and good operating stability at maximum power point under continuous illumination.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed organic semiconductor charge&#8208;transport layers (OS&#8208;CTLs) with high mobility, low trap density, and energy level alignment have dominated the important progress in p&#8211;i&#8211;n planar perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs). Unfortunately, their inevitable long chains result in weak molecular stacking, which is likely to generate high energy disorder and deteriorate the charge&#8208;transport ability of OS&#8208;CTLs. Here, a charge&#8208;transfer complex (CTC) strategy to reduce the energy disorder in the OS&#8208;CTLs by doping an organic semiconductor, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(4,8&#8208;bis(5&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene&#8208;2,6&#8208;diyl)bis(N,N&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)aniline) (BDT&#8208;Si), in a commercial hole&#8208;transport layer (HTL), poly[bis(4&#8208;phenyl) (2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)amine (PTAA), is proposed. The formation of the CTC makes the PTAA conjugated backbone electron&#8208;deficient, resulting in a quinoidal and stiffer character, which is likely to planarize the PTAA backbone and enhance the ordering of the film in nanoscale. The resultant HTL exhibits a reduced energy disorder, which simultaneously promotes hole transport in the HTL, hole extraction at the interface, energy level alignment, and quasi&#8208;Fermi level splitting in the device. As a result, the p&#8211;i&#8211;n planar pero&#8208;SCs with optimized HTL exhibit the best power conversion efficiency of 21.87% with good operating stability. This finding demonstrates that the CTC strategy is an effective way to reduce the energy disorder in HTLs and to improve the performance of planar pero&#8208;SCs.

         <title>A Flash&#8208;Induced Robust Cu Electrode on Glass Substrates and Its Application for Thin&#8208;Film &#956;LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flash&#8208;induced robust Cu on a glass substrate for inorganic&#8208;based micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diodes (&#956;LEDs) is developed by chemical/physical interlocking. The Cu2O layer at Cu/glass interface and Cu nano&#8208;interlocking resolve the inherent lattice mismatch for strong electrode adhesion, resulting in high optical power (41&#160;mW mm&#8211;2) of AlGaInP vertical thin&#8208;film &#956;LED and robust &#956;LED operation under severe environmental stresses.








Abstract
A robust Cu conductor on a glass substrate for thin&#8208;film &#956;LEDs using the flash&#8208;induced chemical/physical interlocking between Cu and glass is reported. During millisecond light irradiation, CuO nanoparticles (NPs) on the display substrate are transformed into a conductive Cu film by reduction and sintering. At the same time, intensive heating at the boundary of CuO NPs and glass chemically induces the formation of an ultrathin Cu2O interlayer within the Cu/glass interface for strong adhesion. Cu nanointerlocking occurs by transient glass softening and interface fluctuation to increase the contact area. Owing to these flash&#8208;induced interfacial interactions, the flash&#8208;activated Cu electrode exhibits an adhesion energy of 10&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2, which is five times higher than that of vacuum&#8208;deposited Cu. An AlGaInP thin&#8208;film vertical &#956;LED (VLED) forms an electrical interconnection with the flash&#8208;induced Cu electrode via an ACF bonding process, resulting in a high optical power density of 41&#160;mW&#160;mm&#8722;2. The Cu conductor enables reliable VLED operation regardless of harsh thermal stress and moisture infiltration under a high&#8208;temperature storage test, temperature humidity test, and thermal shock test. 50 &#215; 50 VLED arrays transferred onto the flash&#8208;induced robust Cu electrode show high illumination yield and uniform distribution of forward voltage, peak wavelength, and device temperature.

         <title>Texture Formation in Polycrystalline Thin Films of All&#8208;Inorganic Lead Halide Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polycrystalline all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx perovskite exhibits pervasive texture expressions when solution processed into thin&#8208;film optical devices. Synchrotron&#8208;based large&#8208;area X&#8208;ray scattering techniques provide insights, which connect the final texture formation to the crystal symmetry of the halide perovskite, which can be tuned via halide mixing. Both I&#8208;rich and Br&#8208;rich materials each exhibit two different, energetically favored texture directions.








Abstract
Controlling grain orientations within polycrystalline all&#8208;inorganic halide perovskite solar cells can help increase conversion efficiencies toward their thermodynamic limits; however, the forces governing texture formation are ambiguous. Using synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, mesostructure formation within polycrystalline CsPbI2.85Br0.15 powders as they cool from a high&#8208;temperature cubic perovskite (&#945;&#8208;phase) is reported. Tetragonal distortions (&#946;&#8208;phase) trigger preferential crystallographic alignment within polycrystalline ensembles, a feature that is suggested here to be coordinated across multiple neighboring grains via interfacial forces that select for certain lattice distortions over others. External anisotropy is then imposed on polycrystalline thin films of orthorhombic (&#947;&#8208;phase) CsPbI3&#8208;xBrx perovskite via substrate clamping, revealing two fundamental uniaxial texture formations; i)&#160;I&#8208;rich films possess orthorhombic&#8208;like texture (&lt;100&gt; out&#8208;of&#8208;plane; &lt;010&gt; and &lt;001&gt; in&#8208;plane), while ii) Br&#8208;rich films form tetragonal&#8208;like texture (&lt;110&gt; out&#8208;of&#8208;plane; &lt;110&gt; and &lt;001&gt; in&#8208;plane). In contrast to relatively uninfluential factors like the choice of substrate, film thickness, and annealing temperature, Br incorporation modifies the &#947;&#8208;CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx crystal structure by reducing the orthorhombic lattice distortion (making it more tetragonal&#8208;like) and governs the formation of the different, energetically favored textures within polycrystalline thin films.

         <title>3D Artificial Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase for Lithium Metal Anodes Enabled by Insulator&#8211;Metal&#8211;Insulator Layered Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) based on a g&#8208;C3N4 layer, which possesses high structural and compositional homogeneity, is proposed to guide conformal Li deposition in the van der Waals gap between graphene and the g&#8208;C3N4. The design of a 3D artificial SEI enables stable cycling of Li metal anodes and provides potential for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries.








Abstract
Despite considerable efforts to prevent lithium (Li) dendrite growth, stable cycling of Li metal anodes with various structures remains extremely difficult due to the direct contact of the liquid electrolyte with Li. Rational design of solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) for 3D electrodes is a promising but still challenging strategy for preventing Li dendrite growth and avoiding lithium&#8211;electrolyte side reactions in Li&#8208;metal batteries. Here, a 3D architecture is constructed with g&#8208;C3N4/graphene/g&#8208;C3N4 insulator&#8211;metal&#8211;insulator sandwiched nanosheets to guide uniform Li plating/stripping in the van der Waals gap between the graphene and the g&#8208;C3N4, and the function of which can be regarded as a 3D artificial SEI. Li deposition on the surface of g&#8208;C3N4 is suppressed due to its insulating nature. However, its uniform lithiophilic sites and nanopore channels enable homogeneous lithium plating between the graphene and the g&#8208;C3N4, prohibiting the direct contact of the electrolyte with the Li metal. The use of the g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;layer&#8208;modified 3D anode enables long&#8208;term Li deposition with a high Coulombic efficiency and stable cycling of full cells under high cathode loading, limited Li excess, and lean electrolyte conditions. The concept of a 3D artificial SEI will shed light on developing safe and stable Li&#8208;metal anodes.

Surface decoration of living cells by exogenous substances offers a unique tool for tuning cell behaviors, which plays critical roles in cell&#8208;based therapy. A facile, yet versatile approach for decorating individual living cells with multimodal coatings by simply co&#8208;depositing dopamine with functional small molecules or polymers is reported. Decorated cells show strikingly enhanced treatment efficacy in colitis mice.








Abstract
Surface decoration of living cells by exogenous substances offers a unique tool for understanding and tuning cell behaviors, which plays a critical role in cell&#8208;based therapy. Here, a facile yet versatile approach for decorating individual living cells with multimodal coatings is reported. By simply co&#8208;depositing with dopamine under a cytocompatible condition, various functional small molecules and polymers can be encoded to form a multifunctional coating on a cell's surface. The accessibility and versatility of this method to decorate diverse cells, including bacteria, fungi, and mammalian cells is demonstrated. With the ability to tune surface functions, ligand co&#8208;deposited gut microbiota is prepared as oral therapeutics for targeted treatment of colitis. Given the dual cytoprotective and targeting effects of the coating, decorated cells show more than 30&#8208;times higher bioavailability in the gut and fourfold higher accumulation in the inflamed tissue in comparison with those of uncoated bacteria. Multimodal therapeutic cells further validate strikingly increased treatment efficacy over clinical aminosalicylic acid in colitis mice. Decorating with multifunctional coatings proposes a robust platform for developing multimodal cells for enhanced cell&#8208;based therapy.
