         <title>Enhancement of Out&#8208;of&#8208;plane Spin&#8208;orbit Torque by Interfacial Modification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) induced switching of perpendicular magnetization in the absence of magnetic field is crucial for the application of SOT&#8208;based spintronic devices. Recent works have demonstrated that the low&#8208;symmetry crystal structure in CuPt/CoPt can give rise to an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (OOP) spin torque and lead to deterministic magnetization switching without external field. However, it is essential to improve OOP effective field for the efficient switching. In this work, we systematically studied the impact of interface oxidation on the generation of OOP effective field in a CuPt/ferromagnet heterostructure. By introducing an oxidized CuPt surface, we found the field&#8208;free switching performance shows remarkable improvement. OOP effective field measurement indicates that the oxidation treatment can enhance the OOP effective field by more than 2 times. We also demonstrate that this oxidation&#8208;induced OOP SOT efficiency enhancement is independent of the device shapes, magnetic materials or magnetization easy axis. Our work contributes to improve the performance of SOT devices and provides an effective fabrication guidance for future spintronic devices which utilizes OOP SOT.

         <title>Stabilization of the Alkylammonium Cations in Halide Perovskite Thin Films by Water&#8208;mediated Proton Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The development of alkylammonium lead tri&#8208;halide perovskite (ALHP) photovoltaics has grown rapidly over the past decade. However, there are remaining critical challenges, such as proton defects, which can lead to the material instability of ALHP. Although specific strategies, including the use of halide additives, have significantly reduced the defects, a fundamental understanding of the defect passivation mechanism remains elusive. Herein, we report an approach and mechanism for minimizing proton defects in ALHP crystals by adding ionized halides to the perovskite precursor solution. This work clarifies that the ionized halides induced proton transfer from H2O to the alkylammonium cation in the precursor solution, stabilizing the ALHP crystals. The fundamental characteristics of ALHP and its precursors were examined by X&#8208;ray diffraction, transmittance electron microscopy, in&#8208;situ extended X&#8208;ray absorption structure, Fourier&#8208;transform nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy. The findings from this work will guide the development of highly stable ALHP crystals, enabling efficient and stable optoelectronic ALHP devices.

         <title>Coordination Polymer Electrocatalysts Enable Efficient CO&#8208;to&#8208;Acetate Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating a coordination polymer catalyst consisting of Cu(I) and benzimidazole units linked via Cu(I)&#8208;imidazole coordination bonds in a cation exchange membrane&#8208;based membrane electrode assembly enables stable acetate electrosynthesis for 190&#160;h, while achieving direct collection of concentrated acetate, an average single&#8208;pass utilization of 50%, and an average acetate full&#8208;cell energy efficiency of 15% at 250&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Upgrading carbon dioxide/monoxide to multi&#8208;carbon C2+ products using renewable electricity offers one route to more sustainable fuel and chemical production. One of the most appealing products is acetate, the profitable electrosynthesis of which demands a catalyst with higher efficiency. Here, a coordination polymer (CP) catalyst is reported that consists of Cu(I) and benzimidazole units linked via Cu(I)&#8208;imidazole coordination bonds, which enables selective reduction of CO to acetate with a 61% Faradaic efficiency at &#8722;0.59 volts versus the reversible hydrogen electrode at a current density of 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in flow cells. The catalyst is integrated in a cation exchange membrane&#8208;based membrane electrode assembly that enables stable acetate electrosynthesis for 190&#160;h, while achieving direct collection of concentrated acetate (3.3 molar) from the cathodic liquid stream, an average single&#8208;pass utilization of 50% toward CO&#8208;to&#8208;acetate conversion, and an average acetate full&#8208;cell energy efficiency of 15% at a current density of 250&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;in&#8208;Gas System for Promoted Photocatalytic Ammonia Synthesis on Porous Framework Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Photocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (PNRR) is emerging as a sustainable ammonia synthesis approach to meet global carbon neutrality. Porous framework materials with well&#8208;designed structures have great opportunities in PNRR; however, they suffer from unsatisfactory activity in the conventional gas&#8208;in&#8208;solvent system, owing to the hindrance of nitrogen utilization and strong competing hydrogen evolution caused by overwhelming solvent. In this study, we combined porous framework materials with a novel &#8220;solvent&#8208;in&#8208;gas&#8221; system, which can bring their superiority into full play. This system enables photocatalysts to directly operate in a gas&#8208;dominated environment with a limited proton source uniformly suspended in it, achieving the accumulation of high&#8208;concentrated nitrogen within porous framework while efficiently restricting the solvent&#8208;photocatalyst contact. Over eight&#8208;fold increase in ammonia production rate (1820.7&#160;&#956;mol g&#8211;1&#160;h&#8211;1) compared with the conventional gas&#8208;in&#8208;solvent system, and an apparent quantum efficiency as high as &#8764;0.5% at 400&#160;nm were achieved. This system&#8208;level strategy further finds applicability in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, featuring it as a staple for photosynthetic methodology.

         <title>High Voltage Enabled Stable Cobalt Species Deposition on MnO2 for Water Oxidation in Acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The design and maintenance of high active sites in acidic environment is vital and challenging for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, we find that the obtained CoO2 under high applied potential can be stable on MnO2 host in acidic environment, which may act as an effective means to solve the instability of cobalt&#8208;based electrocatalyst. The significant improvement of acidic OER activity (6.9 times) and stability (46.4 times) of 90&#8208;Co&#8208;MnO2 (treated by molten salt with more Co deposition sites) demonstrates the advantages of this approach. In&#8208;situ Raman and Pourbaix diagram suggest that the enhanced performance derives from the stable presence of CoO2 at the voltage greater than 1.8&#160;V versus RHE. However, when the potential is less than 1.8&#160;V, the corresponding other cobalt specie is too unstable to facilitate OER. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the deposited cobalt oxides can act as active sites, thus, effectively reducing the reaction energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS). This work provides a new perspective for enhancing the stability of cobalt&#8208;based electrocatalyst. In the future, the dual consideration of applied potential and stable species of active element in Pourbaix diagram may be a new direction for developing acid&#8208;stable electrocatalysts.

         <title>RNA&#8208;Targeting Carbon Dots for Live&#8208;Cell Imaging of Granule Dynamics</title>

Abstract
It is significant to monitor the different RNA granules dynamics and phase separation process inside cells under various stresses, e.g. oxidative stress. The current small&#8208;molecule RNA probes work well only in fixed cells and usually encounter problems such as insufficient stability and biocompatibility, and thus a specific RNA&#8208;targeting fluorescent nanoprobe which can be used in the living cells is urgently desired. Here we report the de novo design and microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis of a novel RNA&#8208;targeting, red&#8208;emissive carbon dots (named as M&#8208;CDs) by choosing neutral red and levofloxacin as precursors. The as&#8208;synthesized M&#8208;CDs is water&#8208;soluble with a high fluorescence quantum yield of 22.83% and can selectively bind to RNA resulting in an enhanced red fluorescence. More interestingly, such an RNA&#8208;targeting, red&#8208;emissive M&#8208;CDs can be fast internalized into cells within 5 seconds and thus used for real&#8208;time imaging the dynamic process of intracellular stress granules under oxidative stress, revealing some characteristics of granules that have not been identified by previously reported RNA and protein biomarkers. Our research paves a new pathway for visualizing bulk RNA dynamics and studying phase separation behaviors in living cells by rational design of the fluorescent carbon dots in terms of structure and functionality for the first time.

         <title>Layered Metal Oxide Nanosheets with Enhanced Interlayer Space for Electrochemical Deionization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrochemical deionization has been regarded as one of the promising water treatment technologies. Here, CoAl&#8208;layered metal oxide nanosheet intercalated by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) with an enhanced interlayer spacing from 0.76 to 1.33&#160;nm is synthesized and used as an anode. The enlarged interlayer spacing provides an enhanced ion diffusion channel and improves the utilization of the interlayer electroactive sites, while heat treatment transferring layered double hydroxides to layered metal oxides offers additional active oxidation reaction sites to facilitate the electro&#8208;sorption rate, contributing to the high salt adsorption capacity (31.78&#160;mg g&#8722;1) and average salt adsorption rate (3.75&#160;mg g&#8722;1 min&#8722;1) at 1.2&#160;V in 500&#160;mg L&#8722;1 NaCl solution. In addition, the excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability (92.9%) after 40 cycles proves the strong electronic interaction between SDS and the host layer, which is validated by density functional theory calculations later on. Moreover, the electro&#8208;sorption mechanism of layered metal oxides that originated from the reconstruction of the layered structure based on the &#8220;memory effect&#8221; is revealed according to the XPS peak shifts of Co element. This strategy of expanding the interlayer spacing combined with heat treatment makes layered metal oxides a competitive candidate for electrochemical water deionization.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancies in Piezoelectric ZnO Twin&#8208;Mesocrystal to Improve Peroxymonosulfate Utilization Efficiency via Piezo&#8208;Activation for Antibiotic Ornidazole Removal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Piezoelectric mesocrystals as defective materials have been demonstrated to possess adsorptive and catalytic properties in redox reactions. However, there is still a lack of research on the quantitative relationship between the defect concentration and the piezocatalytic performance in piezoelectric mesocrystals. Herein, we take twin&#8208;hierarchical structure ZnO piezoelectric mesocrystals with different oxygen&#8208;vacancies (OVs) concentrations to quantitatively investigate the effect of defect content on the peroxymonosulfate (PMS) piezo&#8208;activation in water purification. The ZnO piezoelectric mesocrystal with moderate OVs concentration exhibits a rapid antibiotic ornidazole (ORZ) pollutants degradation rate (0.034 min&#8722;1) and achieves a high PMS utilization efficiency (0.162) that exceeds the most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalytic process, while excessive OVs suppressed the piezocatalytic performance. Through calculations of electron property and reactants affinity, a quantitative relationship between OVs concentration and piezocatalytic properties is established. The ZnO mesocrystal with moderate OV concentration realized increased electron delocalization, reduced charge transfer barrier, and enhanced reactants affinity, thus accelerating the kinetics of PMS activation. This work provides theoretical guidance for the application of defect engineering in mesocrystal to realize enhanced piezocatalytic performance.

         <title>Substitutional P&#8208;type Doping in NbS2&#8208;MoS2 Lateral Heterostructures Grown by MOCVD</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Monolayer MoS2 has attracted significant attention owing to its excellent performance as a n&#8208;type semiconductor from the TMDC family. It is however strongly desired to develop controllable synthesis methods for 2D p&#8208;type MoS2, which is crucial for complementary logic applications but remains difficult. In this work, we synthesize high&#8208;quality NbS2&#8208;MoS2 lateral heterostructures by one&#8208;step MOCVD together with monolayer MoS2 substitutionally doped by Nb, resulting in a p&#8208;type doped behavior. The heterojunction shows a p&#8208;type transfer characteristic with a high on/off current ratio of around 104, exceeding previously reported values. The band structure through the NbS2&#8208;MoS2 heterojunction is investigated by DFT and quantum transport simulations. Our work provides a scalable approach to synthesize substitutionally doped TMDC materials and provides an insight into the interface between 2D metals and semiconductors in lateral heterostructures, which is imperative for the development of next&#8208;generation nanoelectronics and highly integrated devices.

         <title>Enabling 420&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 Stable Lithium Metal Pouch Cells by Lanthanum Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Li metal, a promising anode for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries, typically grows along the low&#8208;surface energy (110) plane in the plating process, resulting in uncontrollable dendrite growth and unstable interface. Herein, we report an unexpected Li growth behavior by lanthanum (La) doping: the preferred orientation turns to (200) from (110) plane, enabling a two&#8208;dimensional nuclei rather than usual one&#8208;dimensional nuclei upon Li deposition and thus forming a dense and dendrite&#8208;free morphology even at an ultra&#8208;high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity of 10 mAh cm&#8722;2. Noticeably, the La doping further decreases the reactivity of Li metal towards electrolytes, thereby establishing a stable interface. The dendrite&#8208;free, stable Li anode enables a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.30% at 8 mAh cm&#8722;2 for asymmetric Li||LaF3&#8208;Cu cells. We further demonstrate a 3.1 Ah LaF3&#8208;Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cell at a high energy density (425.73&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) with impressive cycling stability (0.0989% decay/cycle) under lean electrolyte (1.76&#160;g Ah&#8722;1) and high cathode loading (5.77 mAh cm&#8722;2) using this doped Li anode.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Wavelength Light&#8208;Responsive Metal&#8211;Phenolic Network&#8208;Based Microrobots for Reactive Species Scavenging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a hollow metal&#8211;phenolic network&#8208;based microrobot with spray&#8208;coated asymmetric capping is reported capable of moving under both near&#8208;infrared irradiation and ultraviolet irradiation without fuel. With multi&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;responsiveness, tunable size of the particles, and great reactive oxygen and nitrogen species scavenging capacity, the proposed microrobots can be ideal for future in vivo analytical sensing and medical treatment.








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven microrobots with different propulsion mechanisms have attracted great attention in microrobot synthesis and applications. However, current systems rely heavily on precious metals, using a complex synthesis process and limited working wavelength. It is therefore of great interest to fabricate microrobots that can be driven by multi&#8208;wavelength irradiation and with simple components. Here, metal&#8211;phenolic network (MPN)&#8208;based microrobots are synthesized using a sacrificial polystyrene bead template and an extra capping is added to regulate their symmetry. The hollow MPN microrobots with different layers of capping are capable of moving under both near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, without fuel. The velocity of the microrobots under irradiation is altered by the thickness of the asymmetric capping and their motion could be manipulated remotely by switching the NIR or UV irradiation on and off. With light&#8208;driven mobility, the reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) scavenging activity of the microrobots is significantly increased. Therefore, this proposed microrobot system provides a synthesis strategy to develop asymmetric light&#8208;navigated microrobots for future medical treatment with tunable structure, multi&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;responsive mobility, and great RONS scavenging capacity.

&lt;p&gt;In this work, a hollow metal&#8211;phenolic network-based microrobot with spray-coated asymmetric capping is reported capable of moving under both near-infrared irradiation and ultraviolet irradiation without fuel. With multi-wavelength light-responsiveness, tunable size of the particles, and great reactive oxygen and nitrogen species scavenging capacity, the proposed microrobots can be ideal for future in vivo analytical sensing and medical treatment.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light-driven microrobots with different propulsion mechanisms have attracted great attention in microrobot synthesis and applications. However, current systems rely heavily on precious metals, using a complex synthesis process and limited working wavelength. It is therefore of great interest to fabricate microrobots that can be driven by multi-wavelength irradiation and with simple components. Here, metal&#8211;phenolic network (MPN)-based microrobots are synthesized using a sacrificial polystyrene bead template and an extra capping is added to regulate their symmetry. The hollow MPN microrobots with different layers of capping are capable of moving under both near-infrared (NIR) irradiation and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, without fuel. The velocity of the microrobots under irradiation is altered by the thickness of the asymmetric capping and their motion could be manipulated remotely by switching the NIR or UV irradiation on and off. With light-driven mobility, the reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) scavenging activity of the microrobots is significantly increased. Therefore, this proposed microrobot system provides a synthesis strategy to develop asymmetric light-navigated microrobots for future medical treatment with tunable structure, multi-wavelength light-responsive mobility, and great RONS scavenging capacity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Membrane&#8208;Fusion&#8208;Mediated Multiplex Engineering of Tumor Cell Surface Glycans for Enhanced NK Cell Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8211;shell membrane&#8208;fusogenic liposome is designed to fuse with tumor cell membrane to deliver sialyltransferase inhibitor&#8208;loaded core into cytoplasm and anchor natural killer (NK)&#8208;activating glycan&#8208;modified shell onto surface synchronously. This membrane&#8208;fusion&#8208;mediated delivery approach reprograms the sialic acid&#8208;caused immunosuppression of tumor surface into a Lewis X trisaccharide&#8208;based NK&#8208;activating type, sufficiently reactivating the NK recognition and lysis for enhanced antitumor therapy.








Abstract
Natural killer (NK) cell therapies show potential for tumor treatment but are immunologically resisted by the overexpressed immunosuppressing tumor cell surface glycans. To reverse this glycan&#8208;mediated immunosuppression, the surface NK&#8208;inhibitory glycan expressions need to be downregulated and NK&#8208;activating glycan levels should be elevated synchronously with optimal efficiency. Here, a core&#8211;shell membrane&#8208;fusogenic liposome (MFL) is designed to simultaneously achieve the physical modification of NK&#8208;activating glycans and biological inhibition of immunosuppressing glycans on the tumor cell surface via a membrane&#8208;fusion manner. Loaded into a tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;triggered&#8208;degradable thermosensitive hydrogel, MFLs could be conveniently injected and controllably released into local tumor. Through fusion with tumor cell membrane, the released MFLs could simultaneously deliver sialyltransferase&#8208;inhibitor&#8208;loaded core into cytoplasm, and anchor NK&#8208;activating&#8208;glycan&#8208;modified shell onto tumor surface. This spatially&#8208;differential distribution of core and shell in one cell ensures the effective inhibition of intracellular sialyltransferase to downregulate immunosuppressing sialic acid, and direct presentation of NK&#8208;activating Lewis X trisaccharide (LeX) on tumor surface simultaneously. Consequentially, the sialic acid&#8208;caused immunosuppression of tumor surface is reprogrammed to be LeX&#8208;induced NK activation, resulting in sensitive susceptibility to NK&#8208;cell&#8208;mediated recognition and lysis for improved tumor elimination. This MFL provides a novel platform for multiplex&#160;cell engineering and personalized regulation of intercellular interactions for enhanced cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Widely Tunable Berry curvature in the Magnetic Semimetal Cr1+&#948;Te2</title>

Abstract
Magnetic semimetals have increasingly emerged as lucrative platforms hosting spin&#8208;based topological phenomena in real&#8208; and momentum spaces. Cr1+&#948;Te2 is a self&#8208;intercalated magnetic transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD), which exhibits topological magnetism, tunable electron filling, and magnetic frustration etc. While recent studies have explored real&#8208;space Berry curvature effects in this material, similar considerations of momentum&#8208;space Berry curvature have been lacking. Here, we systematically investigate the electronic structure and transport properties of epitaxial Cr1+&#948;Te2 thin films over a wide range of doping, &#948; (0.33 &#8211; 0.71). Spectroscopic experiments reveal the presence of a characteristic semi&#8208;metallic band region near the Brillouin zone edge, which shows a rigid band like energy shift as a function of &#948;. Transport experiments show that the intrinsic component of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is sizable, and undergoes a sign flip across &#948;. Finally, density functional theory calculations establish a causal link between the observed doping evolution of the band structure and AHE: the AHE sign flip is shown to emerge from the sign change of the Berry curvature, as the semi&#8208;metallic band region crosses the Fermi energy. Our findings underscore the increasing relevance of momentum&#8208;space Berry curvature in magnetic TMDs and provide a unique platform for intertwining topological physics in real and momentum spaces.

         <title>Unlocking High Capacity and Fast Na+ Diffusion of HxCrS2 by Proton&#8208;Exchange Pretreatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pretreatment of NaCrS2 to produce HxCrS2 results in a more robust and higher performing electrode by numerous measures. Proton exchange produces a heterostructure that permits fast diffusion while also seemingly unlocking reversible access to cationic redox, enabling high capacity. The unique biphasic structure of HxCrS2 may be generalizable to other materials, opening a new class of electrode materials.








Abstract
This study presents a new material, &#8220;HxCrS2&#8221; (denotes approximate composition) formed by proton&#8208;exchange of NaCrS2 which has a measured capacity of 728 mAh g&#8722;1 with significant improvements to capacity retention, sustaining over 700 mAh g&#8722;1 during cycling experiments. This is the highest reported capacity for a transition metal sulfide electrode and outperforms the most promising proposed sodium anodes to date. HxCrS2 exhibits a biphasic structure featuring alternating crystalline and amorphous lamella on the scale of a few nanometers. This unique structural motif enables reversible access to Cr redox in the material resulting in higher capacities than seen in the parent structure which features only S redox. Pretreatment by proton&#8208;exchange offers a route to materials such as HxCrS2 which provide fast diffusion and high capacities for sodium&#8208;ion&#160;batteries.

         <title>Dislocated Bilayer MOF Enables High&#8208;Selectivity Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to CO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D monolayer and 2D bilayer metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are constructed by a simple solvothermal method. The bilayer MOF is a novel dislocation 2D porphyrin&#8208;based MOF material that exhibits good structural stability as well as ultra&#8208;high CO selectivity for photocatalytic CO2 reduction (100% selectivity). This work offers a new strategy for the construction of bilayer MOFs and provides a new perspective for the customization of photocatalytic performance.








Abstract
The highly selective photoreduction of CO2 into valuable small&#8208;molecule chemical feedstocks such as CO is an effective strategy for addressing the energy crisis and environmental problems. However, it remains a challenge because the complex CO2 photoreduction process usually generates multiple possible products and requires a subsequent separation step. In this paper, 2D monolayer and bilayer porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are successfully constructed by adjusting the reaction temperature and solvent polarity with 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin as the light&#8208;harvesting ligand. The bilayer MOF is a low&#8208;dimensional MOF with a special structure in which the upper and lower layers are arranged in dislocation and are bridged by halogen ions. This bilayer MOF exhibits 100% ultra&#8208;high selectivity for the reduction of CO2 to CO under simulated sunlight without any cocatalyst or photosensitizer and can be recycled at least three times. The intrinsic mechanism of this photocatalytic CO2 reduction process is explored through experimental characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work shows that the rational design of the number of layers in 2D MOF structures can tune the stability of these structures and opens a new avenue for the design of highly selective MOF photocatalysts.

The multifunctional additive 4&#8208;amino&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzoic acid (ATFBA), with terminal amino and carboxyl groups, passivates the surface defects and enhances the stability of the Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite, therefore resulting in high sensitivity and highly stable Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite photodetectors. In addition, the ATFBA&#8208;based photodetector has been integrated with a pulse oximetry visualization system, successfully yielding accurate blood oxygen saturation and heart rate.








Abstract
Low&#8208;bandgap tin (Sn)&#8208;lead (Pb) halide perovskites can achieve near&#8208;infrared response for photodetectors. However, the Sn&#8208;based devices suffer from notorious instability and high defect densities due to the oxidation propensity of Sn2+. Herein, a multifunctional additive 4&#8208;amino&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzoic acid (ATFBA) is presented, which can passivate surface defects and inhibit the oxidation of Sn2+ through hydrogen bonds and chelation coordination from the terminal amino and carboxyl groups. The perfluorinated benzene ring structure of ATFBA affords the passivator assembled at the grain boundaries to enhance the water resistance. With the synergistical passivation of these functional groups, the Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite photodetector exhibits a remarkable responsivity of 0.52&#160;A&#160;W&#8208;1 and an excellent specific detectivity of 5.34&#160;&#215;&#160;1012 Jones at 850&#160;nm, along with remaining 97% of its initial responsivity over 450 days. Benefitting from high sensitivity, the photodetector is integrated into a pulse oximetry sensor visualization system, yielding accurate blood oxygen saturation and heart rate with less than 2% error. This work paves the avenue toward constructing high&#8208;performance and stable Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite photodetectors for practical applications.

         <title>Y&#8208;Type Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors with Outer Branched Side Chains and Inner Cyclohexane Side Chains for 19.36% Efficiency Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Y&#8208;type non&#8208;fullerene acceptors with outer branched side chains and inner cyclohexane side chains are designed for polymer solar cells with the power conversion efficiencies of 18.52% and 19.36% achieved in the binary and ternary blend devices, respectively, which are among the highest values for single&#8208;junction solar cells at present.








Abstract
Raising the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of Y&#8208;type non&#8208;fullerene acceptors can increase the open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) and thus the photovoltaic performance of the current top performing polymer solar cells (PSCs). One of the viable routes is demonstrated by the successful Y6 derivative of L8&#8208;BO with the branched alkyl chains at the outer side. This will introduce steric hindrance and reduce intermolecular aggregation, thus open up the bandgap and raise the LUMO energy level. To take further advantages of the steric hindrance influence on optoelectronic properties of Y6 derivatives, two Y&#8208;type non&#8208;fullerene acceptors of BTP&#8208;Cy&#8208;4F and BTP&#8208;Cy&#8208;4Cl are designed and synthesized by adopting outer branched side chains and inner cyclohexane side chains. An outstanding Voc of 0.937&#160;V is achieved in the D18:BTP&#8208;Cy&#8208;4F binary blend devices along with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.52%. With the addition of BTP&#8208;eC9 to extend the absorption spectral coverage, a remarkable PCE of 19.36% is realized finally in the related ternary blend devices, which is one of the highest values for single&#8208;junction PSCs at present. The results illustrate the great potential of cyclohexane side chains in constructing high&#8208;performance non&#8208;fullerene acceptors and their PSCs.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Manganese on Carbon Substrate for Aqueous and Aprotic CO2 Electrochemical Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The CO2 utilization and conversion are of great importance in alleviating the rising CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. Here, we report a single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) for electrochemical CO2 utilization in both the aqueous and the aprotic electrolyte. Specifically, the atomically dispersed Mn&#8211;N4 sites are embedded in bowl&#8208;like mesoporous carbon particles with the functionalization of epoxy groups in the second coordination spheres. Theoretical calculations suggest that the epoxy groups near the Mn&#8211;N4 site adjust the electronic structure of the catalyst with reduced reaction energy barriers for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO. The resultant MCs&#8208;(N,O) catalyst exhibits extraordinary electrocatalytic performance with a high CO faradaic efficiency of 94.5%, a high CO current density of 13.7&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, and a low overpotential of 0.44&#160;V in the aqueous environment. Meanwhile, as a cathode catalyst for aprotic Li&#8211;CO2 batteries, the MCs&#8208;(N,O) with well&#8208;regulated active sites and unique mesoporous bowl&#8208;like morphology optimizes the nucleation behavior of discharge products. MCs&#8208;(N,O)&#8208;based batteries deliver a low overpotential and excellent cyclic stability of 1000&#160;h. Findings in this work provide a new avenue to design and fabricate SACs for various electrochemical CO2 utilization systems.

         <title>Room Temperature Spin&#8208;Valve with van der Waals Ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2/Graphene Heterostructure</title>

Abstract
The discovery of van der Waals (vdW) magnets opened a new paradigm for condensed matter physics and spintronic technologies. However, the operations of active spintronic devices with vdW ferromagnets are limited to cryogenic temperatures, inhibiting its broader practical applications. Here, we demonstrate the robust room&#8208;temperature operation of lateral spin&#8208;valve devices using the vdW itinerant ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 in heterostructures with graphene. The room temperature spintronic properties of Fe5GeTe2 are measured at the interface with graphene with a negative spin polarization. Lateral spin&#8208;valve and spin precession measurements provide unique insights by probing the Fe5GeTe2/graphene interface spintronic properties via spin dynamics measurements, revealing multi&#8208;directional spin polarization. Density functional theory calculations in conjunction with Monte Carlo simulations reveal significantly canted Fe magnetic moments in Fe5GeTe2 along with the presence of negative spin polarization at the Fe5GeTe2/graphene interface. These findings open opportunities for vdW interface design and applications of vdW magnet&#8208;based spintronic devices at ambient temperatures.

         <title>Fluorinated Poly(Aryl Piperidinium) Membranes for Anion Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) are a cost&#8208;effective alternative to proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). The development of high performance and durable AEMFCs requires highly conductive and robust anion exchange membranes (AEMs). However, AEMs generally exhibit a trade&#8208;off between conductivity and dimensional stability. Here we report a fluorination strategy to create a phase&#8208;separated morphological structure in poly(aryl piperidinium) AEMs. The highly hydrophobic perfluoroalkyl side chains augment phase separation to construct interconnected hydrophilic channels for anion transport. As a result, these fluorinated PAP (FPAP) AEMs simultaneously possess high conductivity (&gt; 150 mS cm&#8722;1 at 80&#160;&#176;C) and high dimensional stability (swelling ratio &lt; 20% at 80&#160;&#176;C), excellent mechanical properties (tensile strength &gt; 80&#160;MPa and elongation at break &gt; 40%) and chemical stability (&gt; 2000&#160;h in 3&#160;M KOH at 80&#160;&#176;C). AEMFCs with a non&#8208;precious Co&#8208;Mn spinel cathode using the present FPAP AEMs achieve an outstanding peak power density of 1.31&#160;W cm&#8722;2. The AEMs remain stable over 500&#160;h of fuel cell operation at a constant current density of 0.2 A cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Reaction Mechanisms and Kinetics of Nanozymes: Insights from Theory and Computation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanozymes usually refer to inorganic nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like catalytic activities. The research of nanozymes is one of the hot topics on the horizon of interdisciplinary science involving materials, chemistry, and biology. Although great progress has been made in the design, synthesis, characterization, and application of nanozymes, the study of the underlying microscopic mechanisms and kinetics is still not straightforward. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations compute the potential energy surfaces along the reaction coordinates for chemical reactions, which can give atomistic&#8208;level insights into the micro&#8208;mechanisms and kinetics for nanozymes. Therefore, DFT calculations have been playing an increasingly important role in exploring the mechanisms and kinetics for nanozymes in the past years. The calculations either predict the microscopic details for the catalytic processes to compliment the experiments or further develop theoretical models to depict the physicochemical rules. In this work, the corresponding research progress will be summarized. Particularly, the review will be focused on the computational studies that closely interplay with the experiments. The relevant experimental results without DFT calculations will be also briefly discussed to offer a historic overview of how the computations promote the understanding of the microscopic mechanisms and kinetics of nanozymes.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Smooth and Dense Lithium Deposition Toward High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) with stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) and dendrite&#8208;free formation have great potential in next&#8208;generation energy storage devices. Here, we fabricate three&#8208;dimensional (3D) vertically aligned Cu2S nanosheet arrays on surface of commercial Cu foils, which in&#8208;situ generate ultrathin Cu nanosheet arrays to reduce local current density and Li2S interfacial layers on the surfaces to work as excellent artificial SEI. It is found that Li presents a 3D to planar deposition model and Li2S layers are reversibly movable between 3D nanosheet surface and 2D planar surface of Li during long&#8208;term cycling. This enables ultra&#8208;smooth and dense Li deposition at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, presenting an average thickness of &#8764;53.0&#160;&#956;m at 10 mAh cm&#8722;2, which is close to the theoretical Li foil thickness and is highly reversible at different cycles. Thus, 1150 stable cycles with high Coulombic efficiency (99.1%) at ether&#8208;based electrolytes and 300 stable cycles with high Coulombic efficiency (98.8%) at carbonate electrolytes are realized in half&#8208;cell with a capacity of 1 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. When coupled with commercial cathodes (LiFePO4 or NCM811), the full&#8208;cells present substantially enhanced cyclability under high cathode loading, limited (or zero) Li excess, and lean electrolyte conditions, even at &#8208;20&#176;C.

         <title>A Neurospheroid&#8208;Based Microrobot for Targeted Neural Connections in a Hippocampal Slice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Functional restoration by the re&#8208;establishment of cellular or neural connections remains a major challenge in targeted cell therapy and regenerative medicine. Recent advances in magnetically powered microrobots have shown potential for use in controlled and targeted cell therapy. In this study, a magnetic neurospheroid (Mag&#8208;Neurobot) that could form both structural and functional connections with an organotypic hippocampal slice (OHS) was assessed using an ex vivo model as a bridge toward in vivo application. The Mag&#8208;Neurobot consists of hippocampal neurons and superparamagnetic nanoparticles (SPIONs); it is precisely and skillfully manipulated by an external magnetic field. Furthermore, the results of patch&#8208;clamp recordings of hippocampal neurons indicated that neither the neuronal excitabilities nor the synaptic functions of SPION&#8208;loaded cells were significantly affected. Analysis of neural activity propagation using high&#8208;density multi&#8208;electrode arrays showed that the delivered Mag&#8208;Neurobot was functionally connected with the OHS. The applications of this study include functional verification for targeted cell delivery through the characterization of novel synaptic connections and the functionalities of transported and transplanted cells. The success of the Mag&#8208;Neurobot opens up new avenues of research and application; it offers a test platform for functional neural connections and neural regenerative processes through cell transplantation.

         <title>Record&#8208;high Work&#8208;function p&#8208;Type CuBiP2Se6 Atomic Layers for High&#8208;photoresponse van der Waals Vertical Heterostructure Phototransistor</title>

Abstract
The notable lack of intrinsic p&#8208;type two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered semiconductors has hindered the engineering of 2D devices for complementary metal oxide semiconductors (CMOSs). Herein, a novel quaternary intrinsic p&#8208;type 2D semiconductor, CuBiP2Se6 atomic layers, was introduced into 2D family. The semiconductor displayed a high work function of 5.26&#160;eV, a moderate hole mobility of 1.72 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, and an ultra&#8208;high on/off current exceeding 106 at room temperature. To date, 5.26&#160;eV is the highest work&#8208;function recorded in p&#8208;type 2D materials, indicating the ultra&#8208;stable p&#8208;type behaviour of CuBiP2Se6. Additionally, we designed and fabricated a multilayer graphene/CuBiP2Se6/multilayer graphene (MLG/CBPS/MLG)&#8208;based fully vertical van der Waals heterostructure phototransistor. This device exhibited outstanding optoelectronic performance with a responsivity (R) of 4.9 &#215;&#160;104 A/W, an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1.5 &#215;&#160;107%, a detectivity (D) of 1.14 &#215;&#160;1013 Jones and a broad working wavelength (400&#8208;1100&#160;nm), respectively. This was comparable&#160;to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 2D devices. We attributed such excellent performance to the ultrashort transmit length and non&#8208;destructive/defect&#8208;free contacts. This led to faster response speed and eliminated Fermi&#8208;level&#160;pinning&#160;effects. Moreover, ultrahigh responsivity and detectivity endowed our device with applaudable imaging sensing capability. These results make CuBiP2Se6 an ideal p&#8208;type candidate material for next&#8208;generation CMOSs logic devices.

         <title>Bioresponsive Immunotherapeutic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The human immune system is an interaction network of biological processes, and its dysfunction is closely associated with a wide array of diseases, such as cancer, infectious disease, tissue damage, and autoimmune disease. Manipulation of the immune response network in a desired and controlled fashion has been regarded as a promising strategy for maximizing immunotherapeutic efficacy and minimizing side effects. Integration of &#8220;smart&#8221; bioresponsive materials with immunoactive agents including small molecules, biomacromolecules, and cells can achieve on&#8208;demand release of agents at targeted sites to reduce overdose&#8208;related toxicity and alleviate off&#8208;target effects. This review highlights the design principles of bioresponsive immunotherapeutic materials and discusses the critical roles of controlled release of immunoactive agents from bioresponsive materials in recruiting, housing, and manipulating immune cells for evoking desired immune responses. Challenges and future directions from the perspective of clinical translation are also discussed.

2D metal carbides and nitrides (MXene) are promising materials platform for on&#8208;chip neural networks owning to their nonlinear saturable absorption effect. The localized surface plasmon resonances in metallic MXene nanoflakes may play an important role in enhancing the electromagnetic absorption; however, their contribution has not been determined due to the lack of a precise understanding of its localized surface plasmon behavior. Here the saturable absorber made of MXene thin film and a silicon waveguide with MXene flakes overlayer are developed to perform neuromorphic tasks. The proposed configurations are reconfigurable and can therefore be adjusted for various applications without the need to modify the physical structure of the proposed MXene&#8208;based activator configurations via tuning the wavelength of operation. We confirm the capability and feasibility of the obtained results of machine&#8208;learning applications via handwritten digit classifications task, with near 99% accuracy. These findings can guide the design of advanced ultrathin saturable absorption materials on a chip for a broad range of applications.

         <title>Lattice&#8208;Strain Engineering for Heterogeneous Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The energy efficiency of metal&#8208;air batteries and water&#8208;splitting techniques is severely constrained by multiple electronic transfers in the heterogeneous oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the high overpotential induced by the sluggish kinetics has become an uppermost scientific challenge. Numerous attempts have been devoted to enabling high activity, selectivity and stability via tailoring the surface physicochemical properties of nanocatalysts. Lattice&#8208;strain engineering as a cutting&#8208;edge method for tuning the electronic and geometric configuration of metal sites plays a pivotal role in regulating the interaction of catalytic surfaces with adsorbate molecules. By defining the d&#8208;band center as a descriptor of the structure&#8208;activity relationship, the individual contribution of strain effects within state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts can be systematically elucidated in the OER optimization mechanism. In this review, we showcase the fundamentals of OER and the advancements of strain&#8208;catalyst, and enumerate the innovative trigger strategies, with particular emphasis on the feedback mechanism between the precise regulation of lattice&#8208;strain and optimal activity. Subsequently, the modulation of electrocatalysts with various attributes is categorized and the impediments encountered in the practicalization of strained effect are discussed, ending with an outlook on future research directions for this burgeoning field.

         <title>Harvesting Triplet Excitons in High Mobility Emissive Organic Semiconductor for Efficiency Enhancement of Light&#8208;emitting Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting transistors (OLETs), a kind of highly integrated and minimized optoelectronic devices, demonstrate great potential applications in various fields. The construction of high performance OLETs requires the integration of high charge carrier mobility, strong emission, and high triplet exciton utilization efficiency in the active layer. However, it remains a significant long&#8208;term challenge, especially for single component active layer OLETs. Herein, we demonstrate the successful harvesting of triplet excitons in a high mobility emissive molecule, 2,6&#8208;diphenylanthracene (DPA), through triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA) process. By incorporating a highly emissive guest into DPA host system, an obvious increase of photoluminescence efficiency along with exciton utilization efficiency results in an obvious enhancement of external quantum efficiency with 7.2 times for OLETs compared to the non&#8208;doped devices. Moreover, well&#8208;tunable multi&#8208;color electroluminescence, especially white emission with CIE of (0.31, 0.35), from OLETs are also achieved by modulating the doping concentration with controlled energy transfer process. This work opens a new avenue for integrating strong emission and efficient exciton utilization in high mobility organic semiconductors for high performance OLETs and advancing their related functional device applications.

         <title>Over 19% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells by Regulating Multidimensional Intermolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermolecular interactions are ubiquitous and elusive in organic solar cells. Herein, the complicated relationship between multidimensional intermolecular interactions in active layers and photovoltaic performance is disclosed. The results show that complex interactions are critical to synergistically regulating comprehensive properties, including molecular assembly, stacking orientations, charge transport, and morphology management, which helps to achieve an efficiency over 19% in ternary devices.








Abstract
Research on organic solar cells (OSCs) has progressed through material innovation and device engineering. However, well&#8208;known and ubiquitous intermolecular interactions, and particularly their synergistic effects, have received little attention. Herein, the complicated relationship between photovoltaic conversion and multidimensional intermolecular interactions in the active layers is investigated. These interactions are dually regulated by side&#8208;chain isomerization and end&#8208;cap engineering of the acceptors. The phenylalkyl featured acceptors (LA&#8208;series) exhibit stronger crystallinity with preferential face&#8208;on interactions relative to the alkylphenyl attached isomers (ITIC&#8208;series). In addition, the PM6&#160;and LA&#8208;series acceptors exhibit moderate donor/acceptor interactions compared to those of the strongly interacting PM6/ITIC&#8208;series pairs, which helps to enhance phase separation and charge transport. Consequently, the output efficiencies of all LA series acceptors are over 14%. Moreover, LA&#8208;series acceptors show appropriate compatibility, host/guest interactions, and crystallinity relationships with BTP&#8208;eC9, thereby leading to uniform and well&#8208;organized &#8220;alloy&#8208;like&#8221; mixed phases. In particular, the highly crystalline LA23&#160;further optimizes multiple interactions and ternary microstructures, which results in a high efficiency of 19.12%. Thus, these results highlight the importance of multidimensional intermolecular interactions in the photovoltaic performance of OSCs.

         <title>Efficient Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells on Industrially Compatible Textured Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, an anion&#8208;engineered additive strategy is reported to modify the crystallization process of perovskite films on industrially feasible double&#8208;side textured silicon, which enables conformal deposition with improved film crystallinity and reduced trap density. This allows the fabrication of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with efficiencies of 28.9% (certified efficiency of 27.9%) and 25.1% for areas of 1 and 16&#160;cm2, respectively.








Abstract
Monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells promise power&#8208;conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding the Shockley&#8208;Queisser limit of single&#8208;junction solar cells. The conformal deposition of perovskites on industrially feasible textured silicon solar cells allows for both lowered manufacturing costs and a higher matched photocurrent density, compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art tandems using front&#8208;side flat or mildly textured silicon. However, the inferior crystal quality of perovskite films grown on fully&#8208;textured silicon compromises the photovoltaic performance. Here, an anion&#8208;engineered additive strategy is developed to control the crystallization process of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite films, which enables improved film crystallinity, reduced trap density, and conformal deposition on industrially textured silicon. This strategy allows the fabrication of 28.6%&#8208;efficient perovskite/silicon heterojunction tandem solar cells (certified 27.9%, 1&#160;cm2). This approach is compatible with the scalable fabrication of tandems on industrially textured silicon, demonstrating an efficiency of 25.1% for an aperture area of 16&#160;cm2. The anion&#8208;engineered additive significantly improves the operating stability of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells, and the encapsulated tandem solar cells retain over 80% of their initial performance following 2000&#160;h of operation under full 1&#8208;sun illumination in ambient conditions.

         <title>Active Textile Fabrics from Weaving Liquid Crystalline Elastomer Filaments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Active fabrics, responding autonomously to environmental changes, are the &#8220;Holy Grail&#8221; of current development of smart textiles. Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) promise to be the base materials for large&#8208;stroke reversible actuation. The mechanical behavior of LCEs matches almost exactly the human muscle. Yet, it was not possible to produce filaments from LCEs that would be suitable for standard textile production methods, such as weaving. Based on our recent development of next&#8208;generation LCE fibers, here we present the crafting of active fabrics incorporating LCE yarn, woven on a standard loom, giving us control over the weave density and structure. We test two types of LCE yarns (soft and stiff) and their incorporation into several weaving patterns, and identify our &#8220;champions&#8221;: the twill pattern with stiffer LCE yarn that shows the greatest blocking force of 1&#8211;2 N/cm, and the weft rib pattern that shows over 10% reversible actuation strain on repeated heating cycles. We also demonstrate reversible 3D shape changes of active fabric by utilizing the circular weaving patterns that lead to cone shapes upon heating. The seamless combination of active LCE yarns into the rich portfolio of existing passive yarns can be transformative in creating a new type of stimuli&#8208;responsive actuating textiles.

The seamless combination of active LCE yarns into the rich portfolio of existing passive yarns can be transformative in creating a new type of stimuli-responsive actuating textiles.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Inhibiting Formation and Reduction of Li2CO3 to LiCx at Grain Boundaries in Garnet Electrolytes to Prevent Li Penetration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Poor ion and high electron transport at the grain boundaries (GBs) of ceramic electrolytes are the primary reasons for lithium filament infiltration and short&#8208;circuiting of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. Herein, we discover that Li2CO3 at the GBs of Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) sheets is reduced to highly electron&#8208;conductive LiCx during cycling, resulting in lithium penetration of LLZO. The ionic and electronic conductivity of the GBs within LLZO can be simultaneously tuned using sintered Li3AlF6. The generated LiAlO2 (LAO) infusion and F&#8208;doping at the GBs of LLZO (LAO&#8208;LLZOF) significantly reduce the Li2CO3 content and broaden the energy bandgap of LLZO, which decreases the electronic conductivity of LAO&#8208;LLZOF. LAO forms a 3D continuous ion transport network at the GB that significantly improves the total ionic conductivity. Lithium penetration within LLZO is suppressed and an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LiFePO4/LAO&#8208;LLZOF/Li battery stably cycled for 5500 cycles at 3C. This work reveals the chemistry of Li2CO3 at the LLZO GBs during cycling, presents a novel lithium penetration mechanism within garnet electrolytes, and provides an innovative method to simultaneously regulate the ion and electron transport at the GBs in garnet electrodes for advanced all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Recent Advances in Efficient Photocatalysis via Modulation of Electric and Magnetic Fields and Reactive Phase Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The past several years has witnessed significant progress in enhancing photocatalytic performance via robust electric and magnetic fields modulation to promote the separation and transfer of photoexcited carriers, and phase control at reactive interface to lower photocatalytic reaction energy barrier and facilitate mass transfer. These three research directions have received soaring attention in photocatalytic field. Herein, in this review, recent advances in photocatalysis modulated by electric field (i.e., piezoelectric, pyroelectric and triboelectric fields, as well as their coupling) with specific examples and mechanisms discussion is first examined. Subsequently, the strategy via magnetic field manipulation for enhancing photocatalytic performance is scrutinized, including the spin polarization, Lorentz force, and magnetoresistance effect. Afterwards, materials with tailored structure and composition design enabled by reactive phase control and their applications in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and carbon dioxide reduction are reviewed. Finally, the challenges and potential opportunities to further boost photocatalytic efficiency are presented, aiming at providing crucial theoretical and experimental guidance for those working in photocatalysis, ferroelectrics, triboelectrics, piezo&#8208;/pyro&#8208;/tribo&#8208;phototronics, and electromagnetics, among other related areas.

         <title>Resistive Switching Crossbar Arrays Based on Layered Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resistive switching devices made of layered materials (LMs) have shown interesting performance. However, most studies employ fabrication methods and device structures that are not industry&#8208;relevant. In this review, the focus is on the status of crossbar arrays of LMs.








Abstract
Resistive switching (RS) devices are metal/insulator/metal cells that can change their electrical resistance when electrical stimuli are applied between the electrodes, and they can be used to store and compute data. Planar crossbar arrays of RS devices can offer a high integration density (&gt;108&#160;devices mm&#8722;2) and this can be further enhanced by stacking them three&#8208;dimensionally. The advantage of using layered materials (LMs) in RS devices compared to traditional phase&#8208;change materials and metal oxides is that their electrical properties can be adjusted with a higher precision. Here, the key figures&#8208;of&#8208;merit and procedures to implement LM&#8208;based RS devices are defined. LM&#8208;based RS devices fabricated using methods compatible with industry are identified and discussed. The focus is on small devices (size&#160;&lt;&#160;9&#160;&#181;m2) arranged in crossbar structures, since larger devices may be affected by artifacts, such as grain boundaries and flake junctions. How to enhance device performance, so to accelerate the development of this technology, is also discussed.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Promoted Co&#8208;Production of Dihydroisoquinoline and H2O2 over Defective Zn3In2S6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;functional and defective Zn3In2S6 photocatalyst is developed for the simultaneous efficient photocatalytic co&#8208;syntheses of dihydroisoquinoline and H2O2, which shows the highest rate for both reactions up to date.








Abstract
One of the most sustainable and promising approaches for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production in a low&#8208;cost and environment&#8208;friendly way is photosynthesis, which, however, suffers from poor carrier utilization and low H2O2 productivity. The addition of proton donors such as isopropanol or ethanol can increase H2O2 production, which, unfortunately, will inevitably elevate the entire cost while wasting the oxidizing power of holes (h+). Herein, the tetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQs) is employed as a distinctive proton donor for the thermodynamically feasible and selective semi&#8208;dehydrogenation reaction to highly valuable dihydroisoquinolines (DHIQs), and meanwhile, to couple with and promote H2O2 generation in one photoredox reaction under the photocatalysis by dual&#8208;functional Zn3In2S6 photocatalyst. Surprisingly, the suitably defective Zn3In2S6 offers an excellent and near&#8208;stoichiometric co&#8208;production performance of H2O2 and DHIQs at unprecedentedly high rates of 66.4 and 62.1&#160;mmol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1 under visible light (&#955;&#160;&#8805; 400&#160;nm), respectively, which outperforms all the previously available reports even though sacrificial agents&#160;were&#160;employed in those reports. Additionally, photocatalytic redox reaction mechanism demonstrates that H2O2 can be generated through multiple pathways, highlighting the synergistic effect among ROS (&#183;O2&#8208; and 1O2), h+ and proton donor, which has been ignored in previous studies.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Guaranteed High Carrier Mobility in Quasi&#8208;2D Thermoelectric Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The horizontal mirror symmetry in BaAgSb vanishes the electron&#8211;phonon coupling mediated by phonons with purely out&#8208;of&#8208;plane vibrational vectors, which weakens the phonon&#8208;induced carrier scattering and triggers a record hole mobility among polycrystalline quasi&#8208;2D thermoelectrics. Such high mobility accompanied with intrinsically low thermal conductivity gives rise to excellent p&#8208;type thermoelectric performance in polycrystalline BaAgSb.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D semiconductors have garnered immense research interest for next&#8208;generation electronics and thermoelectrics due to their unique structural, mechanical, and transport properties. However, most quasi&#8208;2D semiconductors experimentally synthesized so far have relatively low carrier mobility, preventing the achievement of exceptional power output. To break through this obstacle, a route is proposed based on the crystal symmetry arguments to facilitate the charge transport of quasi&#8208;2D semiconductors, in which the horizontal mirror symmetry is found to vanish the electron&#8211;phonon coupling strength mediated by phonons with purely out&#8208;of&#8208;plane vibrational vectors. This is demonstrated in ZrBeSi&#8208;type quasi&#8208;2D systems, where the representative sample Ba1.01AgSb shows a high room&#8208;temperature hole mobility of 344 cm2 V&#8722;1 S&#8722;1, a record value among quasi&#8208;2D polycrystalline thermoelectrics. Accompanied by intrinsically low thermal conductivity, an excellent p&#8208;type zT of &#8776;1.3 is reached at 1012 K, which is the highest value in ZrBeSi&#8208;type compounds. This work uncovers the relation between electron&#8211;phonon coupling and crystal symmetry in quasi&#8208;2D systems, which broadens the horizon to develop high mobility semiconductors for electronic and energy conversion applications.

Such high mobility accompanied with intrinsically low thermal conductivity gives rise to excellent p-type thermoelectric performance in polycrystalline BaAgSb.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quasi-2D semiconductors have garnered immense research interest for next-generation electronics and thermoelectrics due to their unique structural, mechanical, and transport properties. However, most quasi-2D semiconductors experimentally synthesized so far have relatively low carrier mobility, preventing the achievement of exceptional power output. To break through this obstacle, a route is proposed based on the crystal symmetry arguments to facilitate the charge transport of quasi-2D semiconductors, in which the horizontal mirror symmetry is found to vanish the electron&#8211;phonon coupling strength mediated by phonons with purely out-of-plane vibrational vectors. This is demonstrated in ZrBeSi-type quasi-2D systems, where the representative sample Ba&lt;sub&gt;1.01&lt;/sub&gt;AgSb shows a high room-temperature hole mobility of 344 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; S&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, a record value among quasi-2D polycrystalline thermoelectrics. Accompanied by intrinsically low thermal conductivity, an excellent p-type &lt;i&gt;zT&lt;/i&gt; of &#8776;1.3 is reached at 1012 K, which is the highest value in ZrBeSi-type compounds. This work uncovers the relation between electron&#8211;phonon coupling and crystal symmetry in quasi-2D systems, which broadens the horizon to develop high mobility semiconductors for electronic and energy conversion applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reshaping de Novo Protein Switches into Bioresponsive Materials for Biomarker, Toxin, and Viral Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining regenerated silk fibroin and de novo protein switches enables the design of a variety of sensing interfaces that have long shelf life and are highly sensitive and specific to numerous analytes such as pathogens, viruses, cancer markers, and toxins.








Abstract
De novo designed protein switches are powerful tools to specifically and sensitively detect diverse targets with simple chemiluminescent readouts. Finding an appropriate material host for de novo designed protein switches without altering their thermodynamics while preserving their intrinsic stability over time would enable the development of a variety of sensing formats to monitor exposure to pathogens, toxins, and for disease diagnosis. Here, a de novo protein&#8208;biopolymer hybrid that maintains the detection capabilities induced by the conformational change of the incorporated proteins&#160;in response to analytes of interest is generated in multiple, shelf&#8208;stable material formats without the need of refrigerated storage conditions. A set of functional demonstrator devices including personal protective equipment such as masks and laboratory gloves, free&#8208;standing films, air quality monitors, and wearable devices is presented to illustrate the versatility of the approach. Such formats are designed to be responsive to human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2), anti&#8208;hepatitis B (HBV) antibodies, Botulinum neurotoxin B (BoNT/B), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2). This combination of form and function offers wide opportunities for ubiquitous sensing in multiple environments by enabling a large class of bio&#8208;responsive interfaces of broad utility.

         <title>Control of Host&#8208;Matrix Morphology Enables Efficient Deep Blue Organic Light Emitting Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We demonstrate that mixing a sterically bulky, electron&#8208;transporting host material into a conventional single host&#8208;guest emissive layer suppresses phase separation of the host matrix while increasing the efficiency and operational lifetime of deep blue phosphorescent organic light emitting diodes (PHOLEDs) with chromaticity coordinates of (0.14, 0.15). The bulky host enables homogenous mixing of the molecules comprising the emissive layer while suppressing single host aggregation; a significant loss channel of nonradiative recombination. By controlling the amorphous phase of the host&#8208;matrix morphology, the mixed&#8208;host device achieves a significant reduction in non&#8208;radiative exciton decay, resulting in 120 &#177; 6% increase in external quantum efficiency relative to an analogous, single&#8208;host device. In contrast to single host PHOLEDs where electrons are transported by the host and holes by the dopants, both charge carriers are conducted by the mixed host, reducing the probability of exciton annihilation, thereby doubling of the deep blue PHOLED operational lifetime. Our findings demonstrate that the host matrix morphology affects almost every aspect of PHOLED performance.

         <title>A New Zinc Salt Chemistry for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising energy storage solutions with low cost and superior safety, but they suffer from chemical and electrochemical degradations closely related to the electrolyte. Here we report a new zinc salt design and a drop&#8208;in solution for long cycle&#8208;life aqueous ZIBs. The salt Zn(BBI)2 with a rationally designed anion group N&#8208;(benzenesulfonyl)benzenesulfonamide (BBI&#8722;) has a special amphiphilic molecular structure, which combines the benefits of hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups to properly tune the solubility and interfacial condition. This new zinc salt does not contain fluorine and is synthesized via a high&#8208;yield and low&#8208;cost method. We show that 1&#160;M Zn(BBI)2 aqueous electrolyte with a widened cathodic stability window effectively stabilizes Zn metal/H2O interface, mitigates chemical and electrochemical degradations, and enables both symmetric and full cells using zinc metal electrode.

         <title>Orally Administrable H2S&#8208;Scavenging Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Prepared by Co&#8208;Flow Microfluidics for Comprehensive Restoration of Intestinal Milieu</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Intestinal milieu disorders are strongly related to the occurrence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), which results from mucosa destruction, epithelium disruption and tight junction (TJ) proteins loss. Excess of H2S in the intestinal milieu produced by sulfate&#8208;reducing bacteria metabolism contributes to IBDs development via epithelial barrier breakdown. Conventional interventions, such as surgery and anti&#8208;inflammatory medications, are considered not completely effective because of frequent recurrence and other complications. Herein, a novel oral delivery system, a hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS)&#8208;based polymer&#8208;coated Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (UiO&#8208;66) with a Cux&#8208;rhodamine B (CR) probe (hereinafter referred to as HUR), was produced via co&#8208;flow microfluidic assistance with ability to reduce H2S levels, thus restoring the intestinal lumen milieu. HPMCAS serves as an enteric coating that exposes UiO&#8208;66@CR at the pH of the intestine but not the acidic pH of the stomach. The synthesized HUR exhibits notable therapeutic efficacy, including mucosa recovery, epithelium integrity restoration and TJ proteins up&#8208;regulation via H2S scavenging to protect against intestinal barrier damage and microbiome dysbiosis. Thus, HUR has been verified to be a promising theranostic platform able to decrease the H2S content for intestinal milieu disorder treatment. The presented study therefore opens the door for further exploitation for IBDs therapy.

         <title>Composite Hydrogel for Spatiotemporal Lipid Intervention of Tumor Milieu</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Induction of immunogenic cell death (ICD) plays crucial roles in cancer immunotherapy, whereas its efficacy is severely compromised by redundant antioxidant defenses in cancer cells and aberrant lipid metabolism in immunosuppressive cell populations. Herein, we find that hollow mesoporous CuS nanoparticles (NPs) possess an intrinsic capacity of inhibiting the glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). When loaded with an inhibitor of the ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1), these NPs block two parallel redox systems and cooperate with near&#8208;infrared irradiation to reinforce ICD. We further fabricate a hydrogel co&#8208;delivering cancer cell&#8208;targeting CuS NPs and immunosuppressive cell&#8208;targeting sulfo&#8208;N&#8208;succinimidyl oleate (SSO) for spatiotemporal lipid intervention. While the CuS NPs augment ICD via synergistic lipid peroxidation, SSO reinstates immune perception via lipid metabolic reprogramming, thereby coordinately triggering robust innate and adaptive immunity to restrain tumor growth, relapse and metastasis. Our study provides an immunometabolic therapy via orchestrated lipid modulation in the tumor milieu.

         <title>Density&#8208;of&#8208;state Matching&#8208;induced Ultrahigh Current Density and High&#8208;Humidity Resistance In A Simply Structured Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) can covert mechanical energy into electricity in a clean and sustainable manner. However, traditional TENGs are mainly limited by the low output current, and thus their practical applications are still limited. Herein, we develop a new type of TENG by using conductive materials as the triboelectric layers and electrodes simultaneously. Because of the matched density of state between the two triboelectric layers, this simply structured device reaches an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1400&#160;V and an ultrahigh current density of 1333&#160;mA m&#8722;2 when PEDOT:PSS film and Cu foil are used as the triboelectric pair. The current density increases by nearly three orders of magnitude compared with traditional TENGs. More importantly, our device can work stably in high&#8208;humidity environments, which is always a big challenge for traditional TENGs. Surprisingly, our TENG can even perform well in presence of water droplets. This work provides a new and effective strategy for constructing high&#8208;performance TENGs, which can be used in many practical applications in the near future.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) can covert mechanical energy into electricity in a clean and sustainable manner. However, traditional TENGs are mainly limited by the low output current, and thus their practical applications are still limited. Herein, we develop a new type of TENG by using conductive materials as the triboelectric layers and electrodes simultaneously. Because of the matched density of state between the two triboelectric layers, this simply structured device reaches an open-circuit voltage of 1400&#160;V and an ultrahigh current density of 1333&#160;mA m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; when PEDOT:PSS film and Cu foil are used as the triboelectric pair. The current density increases by nearly three orders of magnitude compared with traditional TENGs. More importantly, our device can work stably in high-humidity environments, which is always a big challenge for traditional TENGs. Surprisingly, our TENG can even perform well in presence of water droplets. This work provides a new and effective strategy for constructing high-performance TENGs, which can be used in many practical applications in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Controlled Adhesion of Ice &#8211; Towards Ultra&#8208;Clean 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The scalable 2D device fabrication and integration demand either the large&#8208;area synthesis or the post&#8208;synthesis transfer of 2D layers. While the direct synthesis of 2D materials on most targeted surfaces remains challenging, the transfer approach from the growth substrate onto the targeted surfaces offers alternative pathway for the applications and integrations. However, the current transfer techniques for the 2D materials predominantly involve polymers and organic solvents, which are liable to contaminate or deform the ultra&#8208;sensitive atomic layers. Here, we develop novel ice&#8208;aided transfer and ice&#8208;stamp transfer methods, in which water (ice) is the only medium in the entire process. Our atomic force microscopy studies showed the hexagonal 2D ice layer can be epitaxially formed between the substrates and 2D layers, enabling the firm attachment/facile detachment. In practice, the adhesion between various 2D materials and ice can be well controlled by temperature. Through such controlled adhesion of ice, we show our new transfer methods can yield ultra&#8208;high quality and exceptional cleanliness in transferred 2D flakes and continuous 2D films, and applicable for a wide range of substrates. Furthermore, beyond transfer, ice can also be used for cleaning the surfaces of 2D materials at higher temperatures. These novel techniques could enable the unprecedented ultra&#8208;clean 2D materials surfaces and performances, and will contribute to the upcoming technological revolutions associated with the 2D materials.

         <title>Seeding and Emergence of Composite Skyrmions in a van der Waals Magnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Topological charge plays a significant role in a range of physical systems. In particular, observations of real&#8208;space topological objects in magnetic materials have been largely limited to skyrmions &#8211; states with a unitary topological charge. Recently, more exotic states with varying topology, such as antiskyrmions, merons or bimerons and three dimensional states such as skyrmion strings, chiral bobbers and hopfions, have been experimentally reported. Along these lines, the realization of states with higher&#8208;order topology has the potential to open new avenues of research in topological magnetism and its spintronic applications. Here we&#160;report real&#8208;space imaging of such spin textures, including skyrmion, skyrmionium, skyrmion bag, and skyrmion sack states, observed in exfoliated flakes of the van der Waals magnet Fe3 &#8722; xGeTe2 (FGT). These composite skyrmions may emerge from seeded, loop&#8208;like states condensed into the stripe domain structure, demonstrating the possibility to realize spin textures with arbitrary integer topological charge within exfoliated flakes of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) magnets. The general nature of the formation mechanism motivates the search for composite skyrmion states in both well&#8208;known and new magnetic materials, which may yet reveal an even richer spectrum of higher&#8208;order topological&#160;objects.

         <title>Direct Visualization of Homogeneous Chemical Distribution in Functional Polyradical Microspheres</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We demonstrate that the post&#8208;functionalization of solid polymeric microspheres can generate fully and throughout functionalized materials, contrary to the expectation that core&#8208;shell structures are generated. We illustrate the full functionalization on the example of photochemically generated microspheres, which are subsequently transformed into polyradical systems. Given the all&#8208;organic nature of the functionalized microspheres, we pioneer characterization methods with high analytical sensitivity and spatial resolution by directly visualizing the inner chemical distribution of the post&#8208;functionalized microspheres based on characteristic electron energy loss signals in the transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Specifically, we successfully combine ultrasonic ultramicrotomy with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and electron spectroscopic imaging (ESI) during TEM. Our findings open a key avenue for analyzing all&#8208;organic low&#8208;contrast soft matter material structures, while the specifically investigated system concomitantly holds promise as an all&#8208;radical solid&#8208;state functional material.

         <title>Advanced Material Design and Engineering for Water&#8208;Based Evaporative Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Water&#8208;based evaporative cooling is emerging as a promising technology to provide sustainable and low&#8208;cost cold to alleviate the rising global cooling demand. Given the significant and fast progress made in recent years, this review aims to provide a timely overview on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art material design and engineering in water&#8208;based evaporative cooling. The fundamental mechanisms and major components of three water&#8208;based evaporative cooling processes are introduced, including direct evaporative cooling, cyclic sorption&#8208;driven liquid water evaporative cooling (CSD&#8208;LWEC), and atmospheric water harvesting&#8208;based evaporative cooling (AWH&#8208;EC). The distinctive requirements on the sorbent materials in CSD&#8208;LWEC and AWH&#8208;EC are highlighted, which helps synthesize the literature information on the advanced material design and engineering for the purpose of improving cooling performance. The challenges and future outlooks on further improving the water&#8208;based evaporative cooling performance are also provided.

         <title>Morphology Tuning via Linker Modulation: Metal&#8208;Free Covalent Organic Nanostructures with Exceptional Chemical Stability for Electrocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The development of synthetic routes for the formation of robust porous organic polymers (POPs) with well&#8208;defined nanoscale morphology is fundamentally significant for their practical applications. The thermodynamic characteristics that arise from reversible covalent bonding impart intrinsic chemical instability in the polymers, thereby impeding their overall potential. Herein, we report a unique strategy to overcome the stability issue by designing robust imidazole&#8208;linked POPs via tandem reversible/irreversible bond formation. Incorporating inherent rigidity into the secondary building units leads to robust microporous polymeric nanostructures with hollow&#8208;spherical morphologies. An in&#8208;depth analysis by extensive solid&#8208;state NMR (1D and 2D) study on 1H, 13C, and 14N nuclei elucidated the bonding and revealed the high purity of the newly designed imidazole&#8208;based POPs. The nitrogen&#8208;rich polymeric nanostructures have been further used as metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for water splitting. In particular, the rigid POPs show excellent catalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with long&#8208;term durability. Among them, the most efficient OER electrocatalyst (TAT&#8208;TFBE) requires 314&#160;mV of overpotential to drive 10 mAcm&#8722;2 current density, demonstrating its superiority over state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts (RuO2 and IrO2).

Abstract
The ability to deterministically fabricate nanoscale architectures with atomic precision is the central goal of nanotechnology, whereby highly localized changes in the atomic structure can be exploited to control device properties at their fundamental physical limit. Here, we report on an automated, feedback&#8208;controlled atomic fabrication method and demonstrate formation of 1D&#8208;2D heterostructures in MoS2 through selective transformations along specific crystallographic orientations. We use the atomic&#8208;scale probe of an aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) and control the shape and symmetry of the scan pathway relative to the sample orientation. The focused and shaped electron beam is used to reliably create Mo6S6 nanowire (MoS&#8208;NW) terminated metallic&#8208;semiconductor 1D&#8208;2D edge structures within a pristine MoS2 monolayer with atomic precision. From these results, it is found that a triangular beam path aligned along the (zig&#8208;zag sulfur terminated) ZZS direction forms stable MoS&#8208;NW edge structures with the highest degree of fidelity without resulting in disordering of the surrounding MoS2 monolayer. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ab initio molecular dynamic simulations (AIMD) are used to calculate the energetic barriers for the most stable atomic edge structures and atomic transformation pathways. These discoveries provide an automated method to improve understanding of atomic&#8208;scale transformations while opening a pathway towards more precise atomic&#8208;scale engineering of materials.

         <title>Rational Screening of Artificial Solid Electrolyte Interphases on Zn for Ultrahigh&#8208;Rate and Long&#8208;Life Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exploration about solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) on Zn anodes is based on trial and error, which is laborious, inefficient, and missing of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art candidates. In this work, an exercisable way is proposed to screen the potential SEIs in view of dendrite&#8208;suppressing ability and charge&#8208;transfer property. As an output, Zn3(BO3)2 is reported as the SEI on Zn anode.








Abstract
Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Zn anodes plays a pivotal role for high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;life aqueous batteries, because it effectively inhibits side reactions and dendritic growth. Many materials are explored as SEIs by a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach. Herein, an exercisable way is proposed to screen the potential SEIs on Zn anodes in view of dendrite&#8208;suppressing ability and charge&#8208;transfer property theoretically. As an output of this screening, Zn3(BO3)2 (ZBO) is checked experimentally. In symmetrical cells, Zn@ZBO runs over 250&#160;h at an ultrahigh current density of 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for a large areal capacity 10 mAh cm&#8722;2. In full cells, Zn@ZBO||MnO2 shows an impressive cumulative capacity (&#8776;406 mAh cm&#8722;2) under harsh conditions, i.e., a lean electrolyte condition (10&#160;&#181;L mAh&#8722;1), limited Zn supply (negative/positive electrode capacity ratio, N/P ratio = 2.3), and high areal capacity (5.0 mAh cm&#8722;2). The significance of this work lies in not only the first report of ZBO on Zn showing excellent electrochemical performance, but also a feasible way to screen the promising SEI materials for other metal anodes.

         <title>Core&#8211;Shell Engineering of Conductive Fillers toward Enhanced Dielectric Properties: A Universal Polarization Mechanism in Polymer Conductor Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new polarization mechanism based on electron displacement across a filler&#8208;cluster is developed, which can quantitatively explain dielectric behaviors of percolative polymer composites. With the guidance, a novel design principle, via the manipulation of filler structure and composite morphology, to achieve desirable dielectric properties is demonstrated. The composite design is fundamentally different from traditional approaches based on filler&#8211;polymer interfaces.








Abstract
Flexible dielectric and electronic materials with high dielectric constant (k) and low loss are constantly pursued. Encapsulation of conductive fillers with insulating shells represents a promising approach, and has attracted substantial research efforts. However, progress is greatly impeded due to the lack of a fundamental understanding of the polarization mechanism. In this work, a series of core&#8211;shell polymer composites is studied, and the correlation between macroscopic dielectric properties (across entire composites) and microscopic polarization (around single fillers) is investigated. It is revealed that the polarization in polymer conductor composites is determined by electron transport across multiple neighboring conductive fillers&#8212;a domain&#8208;type polarization. The formation of a core&#8211;shell filler structure affects the dielectric properties of tpolymer composites by essentially modifying the filler&#8208;cluster size. Based on this understanding, a novel percolative composite is prepared with higher&#8208;than&#8208;normal filler concentration and optimized shell's electrical resistivity. The developed composite shows both high&#8208;k due to enlarged cluster size and low loss due to restrained charge transport simultaneously, which cannot be achieved in traditional percolative composites or via simple core&#8211;shell filler design. The revealed polarization mechanism and the optimization strategy for core&#8211;shell fillers provide critical guidance and a new paradigm, for developing advanced polymer dielectrics with promising property sets.

         <title>Dimensional Control of Highly Anisotropic and Transparent Conductive Coordination Polymers for Solution&#8208;Processable Large&#8208;Scale 2D Sheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The material dimension of copper&#8208;halide coordination polymers can be controlled for 1D, 2D, and 3D via solution&#8208;based strategies. The coordination polymer exhibits a highly anisotropic electronic conductivity of up to &#8776;1000 differences through polaron&#8208;mediated electron transfer. The dimensional control and intrinsic anisotropy add a new degree of freedom to the excitation, detection, and control of electrons and photons.








Abstract
Controlling the dimensional aspect of conductive coordination polymers is currently a key scientific interest. Herein, solution&#8208;based dimension control strategies are proposed for copper chloride thiourea (CuCl&#8208;TU) coordination polymers that enable centimeter&#8208;scale, 2D nanosheet formation for use as transparent electrodes. Despite the wide bandgap of CuCl&#8208;TU polymers (4.33&#160;eV), through polaron&#8208;mediated electron transfer, the electrical conductivity of the 2D sheet at room temperature is able to reach 4.45 S cm&#8722;1 without intentional doping. This leads to a highly anisotropic electronic conductivity of up to the order of &#8776;103 differences, depending on the material orientation. Furthermore, by substituting alternative thiourea candidates, it is demonstrated that it is possible to predesign CuCl&#8208;TU&#160;structures with the desired functionality, stability, and porosity through dimensional control. These findings provide a blueprint to design next&#8208;generation transparent conducting materials that can operate at room temperature, thereby expanding their applicability to different fields.

         <title>Locking Active Li Metal through Localized Redistribution of Fluoride Enabling Stable Li&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A LiF&#8208;rich interphase is constructed via a LiF dissolution&#8211;reprecipitation mechanism, which is conceptually different from mainstream methods. The overall protective LiF&#8208;rich interphase endows the metallic Li electrode with significantly improved anticorrosive properties against electrolytes under various test conditions and enables stable Li&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
The creation of fluorinated interphase has emerged as an effective strategy for improving Li&#8208;metal anodes for rechargeable high&#8208;energy batteries. In contrast to the introduction of fluorine&#8208;containing species through widely adopted electrolyte engineering, a Li&#8208;metal composite design is reported in which LiF can locally redistribute on the Li&#8208;metal surface in liquid electrolytes via a dissolution&#8211;reprecipitation mechanism, and enable the formation of a high&#8208;fluorine&#8208;content solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). For validation, a Li/Li22Sn5/LiF ternary composite is investigated, where the as&#8208;formed LiF&#8208;rich SEI locks the active Li metal from corrosive electrolyte. The Li/Li22Sn5/LiF anode displays an impressive average Coulombic efficiency (ACE, &#8776;99.2%) at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8722;2 in a carbonate electrolyte and a remarkable cycling life of over 1600&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 2 mAh cm&#8722;2. Applied to a LiCoO2 full cell with a high cathode areal capacity of 4.0 mAh cm&#8722;2, a high capacity retention of &#8776;91.1% is realized for 100 cycles at 0.5 C between 2.8 to 4.5&#160;V with a low negative/positive (N/P) ratio of 2:1. This design is conceptually different from the design employing the widely used fluorine&#8208;containing electrolyte additive and provides an alternative approach to realize reliable Li&#8208;metal batteries.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creation of fluorinated interphase has emerged as an effective strategy for improving Li-metal anodes for rechargeable high-energy batteries. In contrast to the introduction of fluorine-containing species through widely adopted electrolyte engineering, a Li-metal composite design is reported in which LiF can locally redistribute on the Li-metal surface in liquid electrolytes via a dissolution&#8211;reprecipitation mechanism, and enable the formation of a high-fluorine-content solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). For validation, a Li/Li&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;/LiF ternary composite is investigated, where the as-formed LiF-rich SEI locks the active Li metal from corrosive electrolyte. The Li/Li&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;/LiF anode displays an impressive average Coulombic efficiency (ACE, &#8776;99.2%) at 1&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 1 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in a carbonate electrolyte and a remarkable cycling life of over 1600&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 2 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Applied to a LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; full cell with a high cathode areal capacity of 4.0 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a high capacity retention of &#8776;91.1% is realized for 100 cycles at 0.5 C between 2.8 to 4.5&#160;V with a low negative/positive (N/P) ratio of 2:1. This design is conceptually different from the design employing the widely used fluorine-containing electrolyte additive and provides an alternative approach to realize reliable Li-metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Flexible Mold Lifetime for Roll&#8208;to&#8208;Roll Scaled&#8208;Up Manufacturing of Adhesive Complex Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step curing technique, including an incomplete curing process and a post&#8208;curing process, is presented as a strategy to enhance the flexible mold lifetime in UV&#8208;curing&#8208;based roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll manufacturing systems. By utilizing the technique, silicone molds patterned with complex adhesive microstructures are replicated over 1000 cycles by highly adhesive polyurethane acrylate materials.








Abstract
Various functional complex 3D patterned surfaces with micro&#8208; or nanostructures have been developed and their superior performances over non&#8208;patterned smooth surfaces proven. However, it is challenging to mass&#8208;produce such complex micro&#8208;/nanopatterned surfaces, which limits their commercialization drastically. Although roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll (R2R) manufacturing using flexible molds has been implemented for mass&#8208;production of such functional surfaces, the poor mold repeatability issue has not been resolved yet. Here, a strategy to significantly improve the repeatability of the micropatterned flexible silicone molds over 1000 cycles against highly adhesive polyurethane acrylates (PUAs) in UV light curing based R2R systems by using a two&#8208;step curing process is reported. The mold repeatability is drastically increased from 10s of cycles to over 1000 cycles through the proposed strategy in spite of the complicated 3D undercut geometry and high tackiness of the microstructure. This two&#8208;step process would enable scaled&#8208;up production of micro&#8208;/nanostructured adhesives, such as gecko&#8208;inspired microfiber adhesives as demonstrated in this study, as well as various other functional micro&#8208;/nanostructured surfaces by enhancing the flexible mold lifetime.

         <title>Tethered Small&#8208;Molecule Acceptors Simultaneously Enhance the Efficiency and Stability of Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermodynamic relaxation of small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) in its blend with polymer donor raises concerns related to the long&#8208;term operational stability of polymer solar cells. With flexible spacers to restrict the motion of individual SMAs, the tethered SMAs show higher efficiency, and, most important, large glass transition temperatures to suppress the thermodynamic relaxation in mixed domains.








Abstract
For polymer solar cells (PSCs), the mixture of polymer donors and small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) is fine&#8208;tuned to realize a favorable kinetically trapped morphology and thus a commercially viable device efficiency. However, the thermodynamic relaxation of the mixed domains within the blend raises concerns related to the long&#8208;term operational stability of the devices, especially in the record&#8208;holding Y&#8208;series SMAs. Here, a new class of dimeric Y6&#8208;based SMAs tethered with differential flexible spacers is reported to regulate their aggregation and relaxation behavior. In their polymer blends with PM6, it is found that they favor an improved structural order relative to that of Y6 counterpart. Most importantly, the tethered SMAs show large glass transition temperatures to suppress the thermodynamic relaxation in mixed domains. For the high&#8208;performing dimeric blend, an unprecedented open circuit voltage of 0.87&#160;V is realized with a conversion efficiency of 17.85%, while those of regular Y6&#8208;base devices only reach 0.84&#160;V and 16.93%, respectively. Most importantly, the dimer&#8208;based device possesses substantially reduced burn&#8208;in efficiency loss, retaining more than 80% of the initial efficiency after operating at the maximum power point under continuous illumination for 700&#160;h. The tethering approach provides a new direction to develop PSCs with high efficiency and excellent operating stability.

         <title>A Monolithic Stochastic Computing Architecture for Energy Efficient Arithmetic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stochastic computing architecture for arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and sorting, with low energy and area overhead through monolithic integration of logic gates and stochastic&#8208;bit generator is reported, which exploits the cycle&#8208;to&#8208;cycle variation in programming of 2D memtransistors based on monolayer MoS2.








Abstract
As the energy and hardware investments necessary for conventional high&#8208;precision digital computing continue to explode in the era of artificial intelligence (AI), a change in paradigm that can trade precision for energy and resource efficiency is being sought for many computing applications. Stochastic computing (SC) is an attractive alternative since, unlike digital computers, which require many logic gates and a high transistor volume to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, sorting, etc., SC can implement the same using simple logic gates. While it is possible to accelerate SC using traditional silicon complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) technology, the need for extensive hardware investment to generate stochastic bits (s&#8208;bits), the fundamental computing primitive for SC, makes it less attractive. Memristor and spin&#8208;based devices offer natural randomness but depend on hybrid designs involving CMOS peripherals for accelerating SC, which increases area and energy burden. Here, the limitations of existing and emerging technologies are overcome, and a standalone SC architecture embedded in memory and based on 2D&#160;memtransistors is experimentally demonstrated. The monolithic and non&#8208;von&#8208;Neumann SC architecture occupies a small hardware footprint and consumes a miniscule amount of energy (&lt;1&#160;nJ) for both s&#8208;bit generation and arithmetic operations, highlighting the benefits of SC.

         <title>Drug Delivery in Plants Using Silk Microneedles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The utility of silk&#8208;based microneedles is demonstrated in delivery of plant hormones (gibberellic acid) to Arabidopsis thaliana and several crop species with minimal wounding response and higher efficiency and efficacy than foliar spray. Microneedle&#8208;mediated delivery allows tissues restricted by current delivery methods to be reached and opens the door to a new tool for plant science and precision agriculture.








Abstract
New systems for agrochemical delivery in plants will foster precise agricultural practices and provide new tools to study plants and design crop traits, as standard spray methods suffer from elevated loss and limited access to remote plant tissues. Silk&#8208;based microneedles can circumvent these limitations by deploying a known amount of payloads directly in plants&#8217; deep tissues. However, plant response to microneedles&#8217; application and microneedles&#8217; efficacy in deploying physiologically relevant biomolecules are unknown. Here, it is shown that gene expression associated with Arabidopsis thaliana wounding response decreases within 24 h post microneedles&#8217; application. Additionally, microinjection of gibberellic acid (GA3) in A. thaliana mutant ft&#8208;10 provides a more effective and efficient mean than spray to activate GA3 pathways, accelerating bolting and inhibiting flower formation. Microneedle efficacy in delivering GA3 is also observed in several monocot and dicot crop species, i.e., tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), lettuce (Lactuca sativa), spinach (Spinacia oleracea), rice (Oryza Sativa), maize (Zea mays), barley (Hordeum vulgare), and soybean (Glycine max). The wide range of plants that can be successfully targeted with microinjectors opens the doors to their use in plant science and agriculture.

Mesocrystals are a class of nanostructured material, where a multiple&#8208;length&#8208;scale structure is a prerequisite of many interesting phenomena. A detailed analysis of X&#8208;ray diffraction from magnetite mesocrystals with different particle sizes and shapes&#8212;in tandem with electron microscopy&#8212;is given. The revealed features provide valuable input to the models of mesocrystal growth.








Abstract
Mesocrystals are a class of nanostructured material, where a multiple&#8208;length&#8208;scale structure is a prerequisite of many interesting phenomena. Resolving the mesocrystal structure is quite challenging due to their structuration on different length scales. The combination of small&#8208; and wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS and WAXS) techniques offers the possibility of non&#8208;destructively probing mesocrystalline structures simultaneously, over multiple length scales to reveal their microscopic structure. This work describes how high dynamical range of modern detectors sheds light on the weak features of scattering, significantly increasing the information content. The detailed analysis of X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) from the magnetite mesocrystals with different particle sizes and shapes is described, in tandem with electron microscopy. The revealed features provide valuable input to the models of mesocrystal growth and the choice of structural motif; the impact on magnetic properties is discussed.

         <title>Emergent Magnetic States and Tunable Exchange Bias at 3d Nitride Heterointerfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality single&#8208;crystalline ferromagnetic Fe3N thin films and heterostructures with precisely controlled thickness are fabricated. A strong in&#8208;plane magnetic anisotropy and reversal of anomalous Hall resistance are observed when its thickness exceeds 5 unit&#8208;cells. Furthermore, the exchange bias effect strongly depends on mechanical bending, yielding to potential innovative applications.








Abstract
Interfacial magnetism stimulates the discovery of giant magnetoresistance (MR) and spin&#8211;orbital coupling across the heterointerfaces, facilitating the intimate correlation between spin transport and complex magnetic structures. Over decades, functional heterointerfaces composed of nitrides have seldom been explored due to the difficulty in synthesizing high&#8208;quality nitride films with correct compositions. Here, the fabrication of single&#8208;crystalline ferromagnetic Fe3N thin films with precisely controlled thicknesses is reported. As film thickness decreases, the magnetization dramatically deteriorates, and the electronic state changes from metallic to insulating. Strikingly, the high&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism is maintained in a Fe3N layer with a thickness down to 2&#160;u.c. (&#8776;8&#160;&#197;). The MR exhibits a strong in&#8208;plane anisotropy; meanwhile, the anomalous Hall resistivity&#160;reverses its sign when the Fe3N layer thickness exceeds 5&#160;u.c. Furthermore, a sizable exchange bias is observed at the interfaces between a ferromagnetic Fe3N and an antiferromagnetic CrN. The exchange bias field and saturation moment strongly depend on the controllable bending curvature using the cylinder diameter engineering technique, implying the tunable magnetic states under lattice deformation. This work provides a guideline for exploring functional nitride films and applying their interfacial phenomena for innovative perspectives toward practical applications.

         <title>A Totipotent &#8220;All&#8208;In&#8208;One&#8221; Peptide Sequentially Blocks Immune Checkpoint and Reverses the Immunosuppressive Tumor Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A totipotent &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; peptide can transform into &#945;&#8208;helix in response to the tumor microenvironment. It possesses the abilities of self&#8208;assembling, blocking the PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1&#160;axis, inhibiting Rbm38&#8208;eIF4E complex formation, and activating p53.








Abstract
Immune checkpoint blockade combined with reversal of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) can dramatically enhance anti&#8208;tumor immunity, which can be achieved by using multiple&#8208;agent therapy. However, the optimal dose and order of administration of different agents remain elusive. To address this dilemma, multiple agents are often grafted together to construct &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; totipotent drugs, but this usually comes at the cost of a lack of synergy between the agents. Herein, by comprehensively analyzing the conserved sites of the immune checkpoint and TME drug targets, peptide secondary structures, assembly properties, and other physicochemical properties, a high&#8208;content peptide library is designed. By using the &#8220;3D&#8208;molecular&#8208;evolution&#8221; screening strategy, an efficient and totipotent &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; peptide (TAP) is obtained, which possesses the abilities of self&#8208;assembling, blocking the PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1&#160;axis, inhibiting Rbm38&#8208;eIF4E complex formation, and activating p53. It is shown that in mice treated with TAP, with either subcutaneous tumors or patient&#8208;derived xenografts, PD&#8208;L1&#160;is blocked, with increased activation of both T and NK cells whilst reversing the immunosuppressive TME. Moreover, TAP can mitigate tumor activity and suppress tumor growth, showing superior therapeutic effect over antibody&#8208;based drugs.

         <title>Unravelling the Interfacial Dynamics of Bandgap Funneling in Bismuth&#8208;Based Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interfacial dynamics and electrochemical interactions of hybrid perovskites prepared by an anion&#8208;exchange process in the photoelectrochemical system is investigated through computational simulation, experimental photophysical, and (photo)electrochemical analysis. The synergically interfacial dynamics and electrochemical analysis help to discover the intrinsic and interfacial properties of semiconductor materials.








Abstract
An environmentally friendly mixed&#8208;halide perovskite MA3Bi2Cl9&#8722;xIx with a bandgap funnel structure has been developed. However, the dynamic interfacial interactions of bandgap funneling in MA3Bi2Cl9&#8722;xIx perovskites in the photoelectrochemical (PEC) system remain ambiguous. In light of this, single&#8208; and mixed&#8208;halide lead&#8208;free bismuth&#8208;based hybrid perovskites&#8212;MA3Bi2Cl9&#8722;yIy and MA3Bi2I9 (named MBCl&#8208;I and MBI)&#8212;in the presence and absence of the bandgap funnel structure, respectively, are prepared. Using temperature&#8208;dependent transient photoluminescence and electrochemical voltammetric techniques, the photophysical and (photo)electrochemical phenomena of solid&#8211;solid and solid&#8211;liquid interfaces for MBCl&#8208;I and MBI halide perovskites are therefore confirmed. Concerning the mixed&#8208;halide hybrid perovskites MBCl&#8208;I with a bandgap funnel structure, stronger electronic coupling arising from an enhanced overlap of electronic wavefunctions results in more efficient exciton transport. Besides, MBCl&#8208;I's effective diffusion coefficient and electron&#8208;transfer rate demonstrate efficient heterogeneous charge transfer at the solid&#8211;liquid interface, generating improved photoelectrochemical hydrogen production. Consequently, this combination of photophysical and electrochemical techniques opens up an avenue to explore the intrinsic and interfacial properties of semiconductor materials for elucidating the correlation between material characterization and device performance.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Reversible Hydrogen Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concept is demonstrated to achieve solar&#8208;driven reversible hydrogen storage of metal hydrides via coupling the photothermal effect and catalytic role of Cu nanoparticles uniformly distributed on the surface of MXene nanosheets. Induced by this synergistic effect, a reversible hydrogen storage capacity of 5.9&#160;wt% is achieved for MgH2 after 30 cycles.








Abstract
The lack of safe and efficient hydrogen storage is a major bottleneck for large&#8208;scale application of hydrogen energy. Reversible hydrogen storage of light&#8208;weight metal hydrides with high theoretical gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen density is one ideal solution but requires extremely high operating temperature with large energy input. Herein, taking MgH2 as an example, a concept is demonstrated to achieve solar&#8208;driven reversible hydrogen storage of metal hydrides via coupling the photothermal effect and catalytic role of Cu nanoparticles uniformly distributed on the surface of MXene nanosheets (Cu@MXene). The photothermal effect of Cu@MXene, coupled with the &#8220;heat isolator&#8221; role of MgH2 indued by its poor thermal conductivity, effectively elevates the temperature of MgH2 upon solar irradiation. The &#8220;hydrogen pump&#8221; effect of Ti and TiHx species that are in situ formed on the surface of MXene from the reduction of MgH2, on the other hand, plays a catalytic role in effectively alleviating the kinetic barrier and hence decreasing the operating temperature required for reversible hydrogen adsorption and desorption of MgH2. Based on the combination of photothermal and catalytic effect of Cu@MXene, a reversible hydrogen storage capacity of 5.9&#160;wt% is achieved for MgH2 after 30 cycles using solar irradiation as the only energy source.

         <title>Fast Transport and Transformation of Biomacromolecular Substances via Thermo&#8208;Stimulated Active &#8220;Inhalation&#8211;Exhalation&#8221; Cycles of Hierarchically Structured Smart pNIPAM&#8211;DNA Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the respiration systems of organisms, highly efficient transport and transformation of biomacromolecular substances are achieved through the thermo&#8208;stimulated active &#8220;inhalation&#8211;exhalation&#8221; cycles of hierarchically structured smart DNA hydrogels. The application of active &#8220;inhalation&#8211;exhalation&#8221; cycles in the poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide)&#8211;DNA hydrogels improves the catalytic efficiency of the incorporated DNAzyme or CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a systems by up to 280% or 390%, respectively.








Abstract
Although smart hydrogels hold great promise in biosensing and biomedical applications, their response to external stimuli is governed by the passive diffusion&#8208;dependent substance transport between hydrogels and environments and within the 3D hydrogel matrices, resulting in slow response to biomacromolecules and limiting their extensive applications. Herein, inspired by the respiration systems of organisms, an active strategy to achieve highly efficient biomolecular substance transport through the thermo&#8208;stimulated &#8220;inhalation&#8211;exhalation&#8221; cycles of hydrogel matrices is demonstrated. The cryo&#8208;structured poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM)&#8211;DNA hydrogels, composed of functional DNA&#8208;tethered pNIPAM networks and free&#8208;water&#8208;containing macroporous channels, exhibit thermally triggered fast and reversible shrinking/swelling cycles with high&#8208;volume changes, which drive the formation of dynamic water stream to accelerate the intake of external substances and expelling of endogenous substances, thus promoting the functional properties of hydrogel systems. Demonstrated by catalytic DNAzyme and CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a&#8208;incorporating hydrogels, significantly enhanced catalytic efficiency with up to 280% and 390% is achieved, upon the introduction of active &#8220;inhalation&#8211;exhalation&#8221; cycles, respectively. Moreover, remotely near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;triggering of &#8220;inhalation&#8211;exhalation&#8221; cycles is achieved after the introduction of NIR&#8208;responsive MXene nanosheets into the hydrogel matrix. These hydrogel systems with enhanced substance transport and transformation properties hold promise in the development of more effective biosensing and therapeutic systems.

         <title>Braiding Lateral Morphotropic Grain Boundaries in Homogenetic Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Morphotropic grain boundaries (GBs) in laterally interconnected cobaltite homostructures are achieved. Single&#8208;crystalline substrates and suspended freestanding membranes provide independent templates for coherent epitaxy and constraints on the growth orientation and strain, resulting in seamless and atomically sharp GBs. This work provides a feasible strategy for exploring potential device applications.








Abstract
Interfaces formed by correlated oxides offer a critical avenue for discovering emergent phenomena and quantum states. However, the fabrication of oxide interfaces with variable crystallographic orientations and strain states integrated along a film plane is extremely challenging&#160;by conventional layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking or self&#8208;assembling. Here, the creation of morphotropic grain boundaries (GBs) in laterally interconnected cobaltite homostructures is reported. Single&#8208;crystalline substrates and suspended ultrathin freestanding membranes provide independent templates for coherent epitaxy and constraint on the growth orientation, resulting in seamless and atomically sharp GBs. Electronic states and magnetic behavior in hybrid structures are laterally modulated and isolated by GBs, enabling artificially engineered functionalities in the planar matrix. This work offers a simple and scalable method for fabricating unprecedented innovative interfaces through controlled synthesis routes as well as providing a platform for exploring potential applications in neuromorphics, solid&#8208;state batteries, and catalysis.

         <title>Boosting Perovskite Solar Cells Efficiency and Stability: Interfacial Passivation of Crosslinked Fullerene Eliminates the &#8220;Burn&#8208;in&#8221; Decay</title>

Li+ ion migration induced &#8220;burn&#8208;in&#8221; degradation in n&#8208;i&#8208;p type perovskite solar cells is reported. To block the Li+ ion movement, a thin cross&#8208;linked [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester layer is introduced on top of the SnO2 layer, resulting in Li+ immobilization. Finally, the efficiency and stability are significantly improved.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) longevity is nowadays the bottleneck for their full commercial exploitation. Although lot of research is ongoing, the initial decay of the output power &#8211; an effect known as &#8220;burn&#8208;in&#8221; degradation happening in the first 100&#160;h &#8211; is still unavoidable, significantly reducing the overall performance (typically of &gt;20%). In this paper, the origin of the &#8220;burn&#8208;in&#8221; degradation in n&#8208;i&#8208;p type PSCs is demonstrated that is directly related to Li+ ions migration coming from the SnO2 electron transporting layer visualized by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF&#8208;SIMS) measurements. To block the ion movement, a thin cross&#8208;linked [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester layer on top of the SnO2 layer is introduced, resulting in Li+ immobilization. This results in the elimination of the &#8220;burn&#8208;in&#8221; degradation, showing for the first time a zero &#8220;burn&#8208;in&#8221; loss in the performances while boosting device power conversion efficiency to &gt;22% for triple&#8208;cation&#8208;based PSCs and &gt;24% for formamidinium&#8208;based (FAPbI3) PSCs, proving the general validity of this approach and creating a new framework for the realization of stable PSCs devices.

         <title>High Entropy Approach to Engineer Strongly Correlated Functionalities in Manganites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study introduces a new approach to materials design based on the inherent magneto&#8208;electronic inhomogeneities present in high entropy (HE) materials to manipulate and enhance strongly correlated functionalities in oxide systems. In this case study, substantial degree of colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and unique lattice imperfections are observed in charge&#8208;doped HE&#8208;manganites.








Abstract
Technologically relevant strongly correlated phenomena such as colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and metal&#8208;insulator transitions (MIT) exhibited by perovskite manganites are driven and enhanced by the coexistence of multiple competing magneto&#8208;electronic phases. Such magneto&#8208;electronic inhomogeneity is governed by the intrinsic lattice&#8208;charge&#8208;spin&#8208;orbital correlations, which, in turn, are conventionally tailored in manganites via chemical substitution, charge doping, or strain engineering. Alternately, the recently discovered high entropy oxides (HEOs), owing to the presence of multiple&#8208;principal cations on a given sub&#8208;lattice, exhibit indications of an inherent magneto&#8208;electronic phase separation encapsulated in a single crystallographic phase. Here, the high entropy (HE) concept is combined with standard property control by hole doping in a series of single&#8208;phase orthorhombic HE&#8208;manganites (HE&#8208;Mn), (Gd0.25La0.25Nd0.25Sm0.25)1&#8208;xSrxMnO3 (x&#160;=&#160;0&#8211;0.5). High&#8208;resolution transmission microscopy reveals hitherto&#8208;unknown lattice imperfections in HEOs: twins, stacking faults, and missing planes. Magnetometry and electrical measurements infer three distinct ground states&#8212;insulating antiferromagnetic, unpercolated metallic ferromagnetic, and long&#8208;range metallic ferromagnetic&#8212;coexisting or/and competing as a result of hole doping and multi&#8208;cation complexity. Consequently, CMR &#8776;1550% stemming from an MIT is observed in polycrystalline pellets, matching the best&#8208;known values for bulk conventional manganites. Hence, this initial case study highlights the potential for a synergetic development of strongly correlated oxides offered by the high entropy design approach.

         <title>Large Magneto&#8208;Transverse and Longitudinal Thermoelectric Effects in the Magnetic Weyl Semimetal TbPtBi</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Huge magneto&#8208;transverse and longitudinal power factors are simultaneously detected in the magnetic Weyl semimetal TbPtBi. This can be ascribed to the magnetic field&#8208;enhanced transverse and longitudinal thermopower induced by bipolar effect, and large Hall angle related to the large net Berry curvature and high carrier mobility, and the incompletely compensated charge carriers and large transverse magnetoresistance, respectively.








Abstract
Magnetic topological semimetals provide new opportunities for power generation and solid&#8208;state cooling based on thermoelectric (TE) effect. The interplay between magnetism and nontrivial band topology prompts the magnetic topological semimetals to yield strong transverse TE effect, while the longitudinal TE performance is usually poor. Herein, it is demonstrated that the magnetic Weyl semimetal TbPtBi has high value for both transverse and longitudinal thermopower with large power factor (PF). At 300&#160;K and 13.5&#160;Tesla, the transverse thermopower and PF reach up to 214&#160;&#181;V&#160;K&#8722;1 and 35&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2, respectively, which are comparable to those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art TE materials. Combining first&#8208;principles calculations, longitudinal magnetoresistance and planar Hall resistance measurements, and two&#8208;band model fitting, the large transverse thermopower and PF are attributed to both bipolar effect and large Hall angle. Moreover, the imperfectly compensated charge carriers and large transverse magnetoresistance induce the maximum magneto&#8208;longitudinal thermopower of 251&#160;&#181;V&#160;K&#8722;1 with a PF of 24&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2 at 150&#160;K and 13.5&#160;Tesla, which is two times higher than that at zero magnetic field. This work demonstrates the great potential of topological semimetals for TEs and offers a new excellent candidate for magneto&#8208;TEs.

         <title>A MoS2 Hafnium Oxide Based Ferroelectric Encoder for Temporal&#8208;Efficient Spiking Neural Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A temporal&#8208;efficient noise&#8208;resilient ferroelectric encoder, exploiting the time&#8208;to&#8208;first&#8208;spike encoding scheme, is proposed for information preprocessing in spiking neural networks.&#160;Our&#160;device manifests prominent ferroelectric dynamics, showing an excellent classification accuracy of 95.14%, in addition to resilience against noise attacks. This work manifests the potential to enable spike&#8208;driven computations for energy&#8208;efficient machine learning and artificial intelligence.








Abstract
Spiking neural network (SNN), where the information is evaluated recurrently through spikes, has manifested significant promises to minimize the energy expenditure in data&#8208;intensive machine learning and artificial intelligence. Among these applications, the artificial neural encoders are essential to convert the external stimuli to a spiking format that can be subsequently fed to the neural network. Here, a molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) hafnium oxide&#8208;based ferroelectric encoder is demonstrated for temporal&#8208;efficient information processing in SNN. The fast domain switching attribute associated with the polycrystalline nature of hafnium oxide&#8208;based ferroelectric material is exploited for spike encoding, rendering it suitable for realizing biomimetic encoders. Accordingly, a high&#8208;performance ferroelectric encoder is achieved, featuring a superior switching efficiency, negligible charge trapping effect, and robust ferroelectric response, which successfully enable a broad dynamic range. Furthermore, an SNN is simulated to verify the precision of the encoded information, in which an average inference accuracy of 95.14% can be achieved, using the Modified National Insitute of Standards and Technology&#160;(MNIST) dataset for digit classification. Moreover, this ferroelectric encoder manifests prominent resilience against noise injection with an overall prediction accuracy of 94.73% under various Gaussian noise levels, showing practical promises to reduce the computational load for the neural network.

         <title>Mixed&#8208;Dimensional Pt&#8211;Ni Alloy Polyhedral Nanochains as Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Direct Methanol Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixed&#8208;dimensional Pt&#8211;Ni nanostructures, consisting of ordered nanopolyhedra&#8211;nanowires&#8211;nanopolyhedra, are designed and prepared for efficient dual&#8208;function application in direct methanol fuel cells. The nanostructure enjoys the advantages of both the optimal catalytic activity of 0D nanopolyhedra and the robust catalytic stability of 1D nanowires, and also compensates for the nonuniformity of catalytic activity and catalytic stability caused by the size effect.








Abstract
Pt nanocatalysts play a critical role in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) due to their appropriate adsorption/desorption energy, yet suffer from an unbalanced relationship between size&#8208;dependent activity and stability. Herein, mixed&#8208;dimensional Pt&#8211;Ni alloy polyhedral nanochains (Pt&#8211;Ni PNCs) with an ordered assembly of a nanopolyhedra&#8211;nanowire&#8211;nanopolyhedra architecture are fabricated as bifunctional electrocatalysts for DMFCs, effectively alleviating the size effect. The Pt&#8211;Ni PNCs exhibit 7.23 times higher mass activity for the anodic methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) than that of commercial Pt/C. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and CO stripping measurements demonstrate the prominent stability of the Pt&#8211;Ni PNCs to resist CO poisoning. For the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), a positive half&#8208;wave potential exceeding Pt/C is achieved by the Pt&#8211;Ni PNCs, and it can be well maintained for 10&#160;000 cycles with negligible activity decay. The designed nanostructure can alleviate the agglomeration and dissolution problems of 0D small&#8208;sized Pt&#8211;Ni alloy nanocrystals and enrich surface atom steps and active facets of 1D chain&#8208;like nanostructures. This work provides a proposed strategy to improve the catalytic performance of Pt&#8208;based nanocatalysts by constructing novel interfacial relationships in mixed dimensions to alleviate the imbalance between catalytic activity and catalytic stability caused by size effects.

         <title>A Demulsification&#8211;Crystallization Model for High&#8208;Quality Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A demulsification&#8208;crystallization (D&#8211;C) model is constructed to describe the crystallization process of the perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs). Furtherly, a multiple&#8208;acid&#8208;anion synergistic assisted strategy is designed to optimize the D&#8211;C model for high&#8208;quality PNCs. Finally, the green light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the PNCs achieved EQE of 22.5%.








Abstract
A room&#8208;temperature technique with all&#8208;nonpolar&#8208;solvent, which circumvents the sensitivity of ionic perovskite to polar solvent, has become attractive for the synthesis of metal halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs). However, the lack of understanding of the inner mechanism, especially for the state of the precursor and the crystallization process of the PNCs, hinders further development of this technique. Here, through systematic study of the Pb precursor and in situ characterization of the PNCs, it is revealed that the reverse micelle nature of the Pb precursor exactly creates a novel demulsification&#8208;crystallization (D&#8211;C) model, namely, a two&#8208;stage nucleation is divided by a demulsification process for the PNCs. On this basis, a top efficiency for green light&#8208;emitting diodes based on PNCs is obtained with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 22.5% through tailoring the D&#8211;C model using a multiple&#8208;acid&#8208;anion synergistic assisted strategy to obtain high&#8208;quality PNCs. Beyond the high efficiency, the work paves the way for diverse ideas in PNC synthesis.

         <title>Skyrmions Under Control&#8212;FIB Irradiation as a Versatile Tool for Skyrmion Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel way to guide the motion and control the nucleation of skyrmions, magnetic bubbles envisioned for next&#8208;generation spintronic data storage and computation, by means of local ion irradiation, is presented. It is shown that ion irradiation with an optimized dose can create repulsive barriers and even nucleation centers for skyrmions.








Abstract
Magnetic data storage and processing offer certain advances over conventional technologies, amongst which nonvolatility and low power operation are the most outstanding ones. Skyrmions are a promising candidate as a magnetic data carrier. However, the sputtering of skyrmion films and the control of the skyrmion nucleation, motion, and annihilation remains challenging. This work demonstrates&#160;that using optimized focused ion beam irradiation and annealing protocols enables the skyrmion phase in W/CoFeB/MgO thin films to be accessed easily. By analyzing ion&#8208;beam&#8208;engineered skyrmion hosting wires, excited by sub&#8208;100 ns current pulses, possibilities to control skyrmion nucleation, guide their motion, and control their annihilation unfold. Overall, the key elements needed to develop extensive skyrmion networks are presented.

         <title>A Switchable One&#8208;Compound Diode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
With Ag18Cu3Te11Cl3, a material for the first one&#8208;compound diode is discovered. A temperature&#8208;gradient driven pn&#8208;junction is realized in a single crystal where p&#8208; and n&#8208;type conduction is accessed without external doping. The transition close to room temperature enables a variety of semiconductor applications.








Abstract
A diode requires the combination of p&#8208; and n&#8208;type semiconductors or at least the defined formation of such areas within a given compound. This is a prerequisite for any IT application, energy conversion technology, and electronic semiconductor devices. Since the discovery of the pnp&#8208;switchable compound Ag10Te4Br3 in 2009, it is in principle possible to fabricate a diode from a single material without adjusting the semiconduction type by a defined doping level. Often a structural phase transition accompanied by a dynamic change of charge carriers or a charge density wave within certain substructures are responsible for this effect. Unfortunately, the high pnp&#8208;switching temperature between 364 and 580 K hinders the application of this phenomenon in convenient devices. This effect is far removed from a suitable operation temperature at ambient conditions. Ag18Cu3Te11Cl3&#160;is a room temperature pnp&#8208;switching material and the first single&#8208;material position&#8208;independent diode. It shows the highest ever reported Seebeck coefficient drop that takes place within a few Kelvin. Combined with its low thermal conductivity, it offers great application potential within an accessible and applicable temperature window. Ag18Cu3Te11Cl3 and pnp&#8208;switching materials have the potential for applications and processes where diodes, transistors, or any defined charge separation with junction formation are utilized.

         <title>Heterogeneous Strain Distribution Based Programmable Gated Microchannel for Ultrasensitive and Stable Strain Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the ion channels in living organisms, discretely distributed laterally free micropillars are introduced into the fluidic channel to act as the gates and construct a gated strain sensor with the conductive liquid infiltrated within the gaps, obtaining a high gauge factor of up to 45&#8201;300, wide broad range of 590%, and great stability of 90&#8201;000&#160;drift&#8208;free cycling tests.








Abstract
Developing highly sensitive strain sensors requires conduction pathways capable of rapidly switching between disconnection and reconnection in response to strain. Ion channels in living organisms exactly control the channel switch through protein&#8208;composed gates, achieving changeable ion currents. Herein, inspired by the gating characteristics of the ion channels, a programmable fluidic strain sensor enhanced by gating ion pathways through heterogeneous strain distribution of discrete micropillars is proposed. During stretching, the contraction and closure of the widthwise gaps between discrete micropillars greatly weaken or even nearly cut off the conduction pathway, resulting in orders of magnitude increase in resistance and thus ultrahigh sensitivity. By adjusting the combination form and structural parameters of the discrete micropillars in the fluidic channel, the sensitivity and strain range can be customized. Thus, a gauge factor&#160;of up to 45&#160;300&#160;and a stretch range of 590% are obtained. Benefiting from the fluidic gating mechanism, no mechanical mismatch can be observed at the interface, breaking through the sensing stability issue of flexible sensors. The proposed sensor can be used to detect the full range of human motion, and integrated into a data glove to achieve human&#8211;machine interaction.

         <title>Dynamic Epitaxial Growth of Organic Heterostructures for Polarized Exciton Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through regulating the location of the dynamic epitaxial growth, a stepwise seeded growth approach is demonstrated for the organic low&#8208;dimensional heterostructures with a hierarchical spatial organization, such as triblock, core/shell, and axial&#8208;branch heterostructures. Moreover, these prepared organic heterostructures can be used in the micro/nanoscale multiple in/output optical logic gates.








Abstract
Highly spatial and angular precision in epitaxial&#8208;growth process is crucial for constructing organic low&#8208;dimensional heterostructures (OLDHs) with the desired substructures, which remains significant challenge owing to the unpredicted location of complex heterogeneous nucleation. Herein, a dynamic epitaxial&#8208;growth approach is developed along the tailored longitudinal/horizontal directions to create diverse OLDHs with hierarchical architectures. The controlled morphology evolution of seed crystals from kinetic to thermodynamic species is achieved via incrementally increasing the crystallization time from 0 to 600&#160;s. Accordingly, the kinetic and thermodynamic seed crystals respectively present the specific lattice&#8208;matching crystal&#8208;planes of (100) and (011), which facilitates the longitudinal epitaxial&#8208;growth (LG) process for triblock heterostructures, and the horizontal epitaxial&#8208;growth (HG) process for axial&#8208;branch heterostructures. The dominant core/shell heterostructures are prepared via both LG and HG processes with a crystallization time of &#8776;30&#160;s. Significantly, these prepared OLDHs realize the rationally polarized exciton conversion for optical logic gate application through the exciton conversion and photon propagation at the heterojunction. This strategy provides an avenue for the precise synthesis of OLDHs with anisotropy optical characters for integrated optoelectronics.

&lt;p&gt;Highly spatial and angular precision in epitaxial-growth process is crucial for constructing organic low-dimensional heterostructures (OLDHs) with the desired substructures, which remains significant challenge owing to the unpredicted location of complex heterogeneous nucleation. Herein, a dynamic epitaxial-growth approach is developed along the tailored longitudinal/horizontal directions to create diverse OLDHs with hierarchical architectures. The controlled morphology evolution of seed crystals from kinetic to thermodynamic species is achieved via incrementally increasing the crystallization time from 0 to 600&#160;s. Accordingly, the kinetic and thermodynamic seed crystals respectively present the specific lattice-matching crystal-planes of (100) and (011), which facilitates the longitudinal epitaxial-growth (LG) process for triblock heterostructures, and the horizontal epitaxial-growth (HG) process for axial-branch heterostructures. The dominant core/shell heterostructures are prepared via both LG and HG processes with a crystallization time of &#8776;30&#160;s. Significantly, these prepared OLDHs realize the rationally polarized exciton conversion for optical logic gate application through the exciton conversion and photon propagation at the heterojunction. This strategy provides an avenue for the precise synthesis of OLDHs with anisotropy optical characters for integrated optoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reconstruction of Thiospinel to Active Sites and Spin Channels for Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical reconstruction of thiospinel CoFe2S4 evolves both oxyhydroxide species as active site and Fe3S4 component as spin channel, which is unique. The reconstructed CoFe2S4 shows state&#8208;of&#8208;art oxygen evolution reaction activity because of a strong magnetic anisotropy at the interface between oxyhydroxide and Fe3S4 components. The reconstructed configuration also benefits a robust performance in membrane electrolyzers.








Abstract
Water electrolysis is a promising technique for carbon neutral hydrogen production. A great challenge remains at developing robust and low&#8208;cost anode catalysts. Many pre&#8208;catalysts are found to undergo surface reconstruction to give high intrinsic activity in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The reconstructed oxyhydroxides on the surface are active species and most of them outperform directly synthesized oxyhydroxides. The reason for the high intrinsic activity remains to be explored. Here, a study is reported to showcase the unique reconstruction behaviors of a pre&#8208;catalyst, thiospinel CoFe2S4, and its reconstruction chemistry for a high OER activity. The reconstruction of CoFe2S4 gives a mixture with both Fe&#8211;S component and active oxyhydroxide (Co(Fe)OxHy) because Co is more inclined to reconstruct as oxyhydroxide, while the Fe is more stable in Fe&#8211;S component in a major form of Fe3S4. The interface spin channel is demonstrated in the reconstructed CoFe2S4, which optimizes the energetics of OER steps on Co(Fe)OxHy species and facilitates the spin sensitive electron transfer to reduce the kinetic barrier of O&#8211;O coupling. The advantage is also demonstrated in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer. This work introduces the feasibility of engineering the reconstruction chemistry of the precatalyst for high performance and durable MEA electrolyzers.

         <dc:description>
2D colloidal self&#8208;assembly provides a simple strategy to produce functional nanostructure arrays. Regularity of the formed 2D crystal is essential to ensure functionality, but can be difficult to achieve in self&#8208;assembling systems.

Abstract
2D colloidal crystallization provides a simple strategy to produce defined nanostructure arrays over macroscopic areas. Regularity and long&#8208;range order of such crystals is essential to ensure functionality, but difficult to achieve in self&#8208;assembling systems. Here, a simple loudspeaker setup for the acoustic crystallization of 2D colloidal crystals (ACDC) of polystyrene, microgels, and core&#8211;shell particles at liquid interfaces is introduced. This setup anneals an interfacial colloidal monolayer and affords an increase in average grain size by almost two orders of magnitude. The order is characterized via the structural color of the colloidal crystal, the acoustic annealing process is optimized via the frequency and the amplitude of the applied sound wave, and its efficiency is rationalized via the surface coverage&#8208;dependent interactions within the interfacial colloidal monolayer. Computer simulations show that multiple rearrangement mechanisms at different length scales, from the local motion around voids to grain boundary movements via consecutive particle rotations around common centers, collude to remove defects. The experimentally simple ACDC process, paired with the demonstrated applicability toward complex particle systems, provides access to highly defined nanostructure arrays for a wide range of research communities.

         <title>Engineering Spin Configurations of Synthetic Antiferromagnet by Controlling Long&#8208;Range Oscillatory Interlayer Coupling and Neighboring Ferrimagnetic Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controllable manipulation of the inner spin configuration of the Pt/[Co/Pt/Co]/Ru/CoTb heterostructure is achieved by controlling long&#8208;range interlayer coupling and neighboring ferrimagnetic coupling. Based on controllable spin regulations, ferrimagnetic&#8208;based synesthetic antiferromagnetic devices with compensated magnetization, enhanced Hall resistance, and wide&#8208;temperature stable spin&#8208;orbit torque switching are realized, which are of great interest for the realistic spin&#8208;orbitronic applications.








Abstract
Controllable manipulation of specific spin configurations of magnetic materials is the key to constructing functional spintronic devices. Here, it is demonstrated by integrating the merits of ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, and antiferromagnetic spin configurations into one synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) heterostructure by controlling both long&#8208;range oscillatory interlayer coupling and neighboring ferrimagnetic coupling. A controllable manipulation of four types of spin configurations of the Pt/[Co/Pt/Co]/Ru/CoTb SAF heterostructures composed of ferromagnetic Co/Pt/Co and ferrimagnetic CoTb layers is successfully achieved. In particular, the compensated magnetization, enhanced anomalous Hall resistance in the remanence state, wide&#8208;temperature spin&#8208;orbit torque switching of magnetization, and high immunity to the external magnetic field are simultaneously obtained in one of the SAF heterojunctions with macroscopic interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling. This design concept of engineering spin configurations may enable efficient spin manipulation for customized memory and logic applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Aerogels: A New Platform for Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unique high&#8208;entropy alloy aerogels (HEAAs) with strong metal interactions and abundant unsaturated sites are constructed. Particularly, PdCuAuAgBiIn HEAAs achieve almost 100% of Faradaic efficiency (FE) for C1 products from &#8722;0.7 to &#8722;1.1&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a maximum FE for formic acid of 98.1% at &#8722;1.1&#160;VRHE, showing a new class of electrocatalysts for CO2 electroreduction with potential practical applications.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloy aerogels (HEAAs) combined with the advantages of high&#8208;entropy alloys and aerogels are prospective new platforms in catalytic reactions. However, due to the differences in reduction potentials and miscibility behavior of different metals, the realization of HEAAs with a single phase is still a great challenge. Herein, a series of HEAAs is fabricated via the freeze&#8211;thaw method as highly active and durable electrocatalysts for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). Especially, the PdCuAuAgBiIn HEAAs can achieve Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C1 products almost 100% from &#8722;0.7 to &#8722;1.1&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (VRHE), and a maximum FE for formic acid (FEHCOOH) of 98.1% at &#8722;1.1&#160;VRHE, outperforming PdCuAuAgBiIn high&#8208;entropy alloy particles (HEAPs) and Pd metallic aerogels (MAs). Specifically, the current density and FEHCOOH are almost 200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 87% in a flow cell. The impressive CO2RR performance of the PdCuAuAgBiIn HEAAs is attributed to the strong interactions between the different metals and the surface unsaturated sites, which can regulate the electronic structures of different metals and allow the optimal HCOO* intermediate adsorption and desorption onto the catalysts surface to enhance HCOOH production. The work not only provides a facile synthetic strategy to fabricate HEAAs, but also opens the avenue for development of efficient catalysts and beyond.

         <title>A Template Editing Strategy to Create Interlayer&#8208;Confined Active Species for Efficient and Durable Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interlayer&#8208;confined intercalated architecture is created by template editing, suppressing the undesirable &#947; to &#946; phase transformation and exhibiting efficient and durable oxygen evolution reaction activity. As a result, water oxidation can occur at an extremely low overpotential of 130&#160;mV and affords 1000&#160;h stability at 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Substantial overpotentials and insufficient and unstable active sites of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts limit their efficiency and stability in OER&#8208;related energy conversion and storage technologies. Here, a template editing strategy is proposed to graft highly active catalytic species onto highly conductive rigid frameworks to tackle this challenge. As a successful attempt, two types of NiO6 units of layered Ni BDC (BDC stands for 1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylic acid) metal organic frameworks are selectively edited by chemical etching&#8208;assisted electroxidation to create layered &#947;&#8208;NiOOH with intercalated Ni&#8211;O species. In such an interlayer&#8208;confined intercalated architecture, the large interlayer space with high ion permeability offers an ideal reaction region to sufficiently expose the OER active sites comprising high&#8208;density intercalated Ni&#8211;O species, which also suppresses the undesirable &#947; to &#946; phase transformation, thus exhibiting efficient and durable OER activity. As a result, water oxidation can occur at an extremely low overpotential of 130&#160;mV and affords 1000&#160;h stability at 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The strategy conceptually shows the possibility of achieving stable homogeneous&#8208;like catalysis in heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Triggering ZT to 0.40 by Engineering Orientation in One Polymeric Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimodal orientation of diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based polymer films exhibits a figure of merit of 0.40, which is more than 400% superior to the corresponding values of face&#8208;on/edge&#8208;on unimodal films.








Abstract
Breaking the thermoelectric (TE) trade&#8208;off relationship is an important task for maximizing the TE performance of polymeric semiconductors. Existing efforts have focused on designing high&#8208;mobility semiconductors and achieving ordered molecular doping, ignoring the critical role of the molecular orientation during TE conversion. Herein, the achievement of ZT to 0.40 is reported by fine&#8208;tuning the molecular orientation of one diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)&#8208;based polymer (DPP&#8208;BTz). Films with bimodal molecular orientation yield superior doping efficiency by increasing the lamellar spacing and achieve increased splitting between the Fermi energy and the transport energy to enhance the thermopower. These factors contribute to the simultaneous improvement in the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity in an unexpected manner. Importantly, the bimodal film exhibits a maximum power factor of up to 346 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2, &gt;400% higher than that of unimodal films. These results demonstrate the great potential of molecular orientation engineering in polymeric semiconductors for developing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic TE (OTE) materials.

         <title>In Situ Confinement of Ultrasmall Metal Nanoparticles in Short Mesochannels for Durable Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction with High Efficiency and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal in situ confinement strategy is developed to synthesize ultrasmall metal nanoparticles in the mesochannels of 1D mesoporous carbon. The obtained catalysts show an impressive electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction performance with nearly 100% conversion efficiency, 98% N2&#160;selectivity, 55% current efficiency, an ultralong cycling stability over 30&#160;days, and an ultrahigh removal capacity of 15&#8201;000&#160;mg&#160;N&#160;g&#8722;1 CuPd.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction is a sustainable approach for NO3&#8722; removal and high&#8208;value N&#8208;containing compounds manufacturing, which, however, is strongly obstructed by sluggish kinetics, low selectivity, and poor stability. Herein, the in situ confinement of ultrasmall CuPd alloy nanoparticles in mesochannels of conductive core&#8211;shell structured carbon nanotubes@mesoporous carbon substrates (CNTs@mesoC@CuPd) via a simple molecule&#8208;mediated interfacial assembly method is reported. As a catalyst for electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction, the CNTs@mesoC@CuPd shows a splendid conversion efficiency (100%), N2&#160;selectivity (98%), cycling stability (&gt;30&#160;days), and removal capacity as high as 30&#160;000&#160;mg&#160;N&#160;g&#8722;1 CuPd, which are much superior to most of the prior reports. Notably, experimental (in situ testing and isotopic labeling) and theoretical results unveil that bimetallic and monometallic catalysts for electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction exhibit exclusive selectivity for N2&#160;and NH3, respectively. This in situ confinement strategy is universal for the synthesis of stable and highly accessible metallic catalysts, which opens an appealing way to synthesize advanced catalysts with high activity, selectivity, and stability.

         <title>Ultrafast Non&#8208;Equilibrium Synthesis of Cathode Materials for Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrafast high&#8208;temperature shock strategy is proposed to synthesize cathode materials in seconds for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, avoiding high energy and long time consumption. It provides an ultrahigh heating rate, leading to a non&#8208;equilibrium reaction and fast reaction kinetics. Mainstream cathode materials are successfully synthesized with pure phases, oxygen vacancies, ultrasmall particle sizes, and good electrochemical performance, indicative of a universal and efficient synthesis approach.








Abstract
The synthesis of cathode materials plays an important role in determining the production efficiency, cost, and performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, conventional synthesis methods always experience a slow heating rate and involve a complicated multistep reaction process and sluggish reaction dynamics, leading to high energy and long time consumption. Herein, a high&#8208;temperature shock (HTS) strategy is reported for the ultrafast synthesis of cathode materials in seconds. The HTS process experiences an ultrahigh heating rate, leading to a non&#8208;equilibrium reaction and fast reaction kinetics, and avoids high energy and long time consumption. Mainstream cathode materials (such as LiMn2O4, LiCoO2, LiFePO4, and Li&#8208;rich layered oxide/NiO heterostructured material) are successfully synthesized with pure phases, oxygen vacancies, ultrasmall particle sizes, and good electrochemical performance. The HTS process not only provides an efficient synthesis approach for cathode materials, but also can be extended beyond lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An injectable antibody&#8208;loaded supramolecular nanofiber hydrogel is fabricated by mixing betamethasone phosphate (BetP), anti&#8208;vascular endothelial growth factor (anti&#8208;VEGF), with CaCl2. Such a BetP hydrogel based on all clinically approved agents can prolong the effective treatment time of conventional anti&#8208;VEGF therapy, and may be readily translated into clinical use for age&#8208;related macular degeneration treatment, with the potential to replace the current therapy.








Abstract
Age&#8208;related macular degeneration (AMD) is a major cause of visual impairment and severe vision loss worldwide, while the currently available treatments are often unsatisfactory. Previous studies have demonstrated both inflammation and oxidative&#8208;stress&#8208;induced damage to the retinal pigment epithelium are involved in the pathogenesis of aberrant development of blood vessels in wet AMD (wet&#8208;AMD). Although antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy (e.g., Ranibizumab) can impair the growth of new blood vessels, side effects are still found with repeated monthly intravitreal injections. Here, an injectable antibody&#8208;loaded supramolecular nanofiber hydrogel is fabricated by simply mixing betamethasone phosphate (BetP), a clinic anti&#8208;inflammatory drug, anti&#8208;VEGF, the gold&#8208;standard anti&#8208;VEGF drug for AMD treatment, with CaCl2. Upon intravitreal injection, such BetP&#8208;based hydrogel (BetP&#8208;Gel),&#160;while enabling long&#8208;term sustained release of anti&#8208;VEGF to inhibit vascular proliferation in the retina and attenuate choroidal neovascularization, can also scavenge reactive oxygen species to reduce local inflammation. Remarkably, such BetP&#8208;Gel can dramatically prolong the effective treatment time of conventional anti&#8208;VEGF therapy. Notably, anti&#8208;VEGF&#8208;loaded supramolecular hydrogel based on all clinically approved agents may be readily translated into clinical use for AMD treatment, with the potential to replace the current anti&#8208;VEGF therapy.

         <title>Panoramic Mapping of Phonon Transport from Ultrafast Electron Diffraction and Scientific Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integrated experimental&#8208;machine learning framework that extracts crucial hidden phonon thermal transport properties from ultrafast diffraction. The phonon transport results in local atomic vibrations that further links to the time&#8208;dependent diffraction intensities. By using adjoint&#8208;state scientific machine learning approach to solve the inverse thermal transport containing thousands of coupled differential equations, the hidden phonon properties can be reliably uncovered.








Abstract
One central challenge in understanding phonon thermal transport is a lack of experimental tools to investigate frequency&#8208;resolved phonon transport. Although recent advances in computation lead to frequency&#8208;resolved information, it is hindered by unknown defects in bulk regions and at interfaces. Here, a framework that can uncover microscopic phonon transport information in heterostructures is presented, integrating state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) with advanced scientific machine learning (SciML). Taking advantage of the dual temporal and reciprocal&#8208;space resolution in UED, and the ability of SciML to solve inverse problems involving O(103)$\mathcal{O}({10^3})$ coupled Boltzmann transport equations, the frequency&#8208;dependent interfacial transmittance and frequency&#8208;dependent relaxation times of the heterostructure from the diffraction patterns are reliably recovered. The framework is applied to experimental Au/Si UED data, and a transport pattern beyond the diffuse mismatch model is revealed, which further enables a direct reconstruction of real&#8208;space, real&#8208;time, frequency&#8208;resolved phonon dynamics across the interface. The work provides a new pathway to probe interfacial phonon transport mechanisms with unprecedented&#160;details.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed Prolamin Scaffolds for Cell&#8208;Based Meat Culture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Edible prolamin scaffolds with a highly ordered tessellated structure are printed based on the electrohydrodynamic printing technique after formulating food&#8208;grade zein/hordein and zein/secalin inks. Mouse skeletal myoblasts and porcine skeletal muscle satellite cells show favorable cellular activities on the prepared fibrous matrix, demonstrating the great potential of prolamin scaffolds in cultured meat production.








Abstract
Cultivating meat from muscle stem cells in vitro requires 3D edible scaffolds as the supporting matrix. Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing is an emerging 3D&#8208;printing technology for fabricating ultrafine fibrous scaffolds with high precision microstructures for biomedical applications. However, edible EHD&#8208;printed scaffolds remain scarce in cultured meat (CM) production partly due to special requirements with regard to the printability of ink. Here, hordein or secalin is mixed, which are cereal prolamins extracted from barley or rye, with zein to produce pure prolamin&#8208;based inks, which exhibit favorable printability similar to common polycaprolactone ink. Zein/hordein and zein/secalin scaffolds with highly ordered tessellated structures are successfully fabricated after optimizing printing conditions. The prolamin scaffolds demonstrated good water stability and in vitro degradability due to the porous fiber surface, which is spontaneously generated by culturing muscle cells for 1&#160;week. Moreover, mouse skeletal myoblasts (C2C12) and porcine skeletal muscle satellite cells (PSCs) can adhere and proliferate on the fibrous matrix, and a CM slice is produced by culturing PSCs on prolamin scaffolds with high tissue similarity. The upregulation of myogenic proteins shows that the differentiation process is triggered in the 3D culture, demonstrating the great potential of prolamin scaffolds in CM production.

         <title>Dynamic Sustainable Polyimide Film Combining Hardness with Softness via a &#8220;Mimosa&#8208;Like&#8221; Bionic Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic polyimide (PI) film, which can transform among three molecular structures,&#160;is designed by imitating the behavior of the Mimosa plant. The PI film is a super&#8208;corona&#8208;resistant film, a matrix of high&#8208;sensitivity humidity sensor and carbon&#8208;fiber&#8208;reinforced composites due to its excellent capabilities of degradation, self&#8208;healable ability, and recyclability.








Abstract
Dielectric polyimides (PIs)&#160;are ubiquitous as insulation in electrical power systems and electronic devices. Generally, dynamic polyimide is required to solve irreversible failure processes of electrical or mechanical damage, for example, under high temperature, pressure, and field strength. The challenge lies in the design of the molecular structure of rigid polyimide to achieve dynamic reversibility. Herein, a low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polyimide gene unit is designed to crosslink with polyimide ligase to prepare the smart film. Interestingly, due to the variability of gene unit and ligase combinations, the polyimide films combining hardness with softness are designed into three forms via a &#8220;Mimosa&#8208;like&#8221; bionic strategy to adapt to different application scenarios. Meanwhile, the films have good degradation efficiency, excellent recyclability, and can be self&#8208;healable, which makes them reuse. Clearly, the films can be used in the preparation of ultrafast sensors with a response time &#8776;0.15 s and the application of corona&#8208;resistant films with 100% recovery. Furthermore, the construction of polyimide and carbon&#8208;fiber&#8208;reinforced composites (CFRCs) has been verified to apply to the worse environment. Nicely, the composites have the property of multiple cycles and the non&#8208;destructive recycle rate of carbon fiber (CF) is as high as 100%. The design idea of preparing high&#8208;strength dynamic polyimide by crosslinking simple polyimide gene unit with ligase could provide a good foundation and a clear case for the sustainable development of electrical and electronic polyimides, from the perspective of Mimosa bionics.

Roll&#8208;To&#8208;Roll Manufacturing
In article number 2207257, Metin Sitti and co&#8208;workers report a two&#8208;step curing&#8208;based roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll manufacturing process for the improvement of the repeatability and durability of flexible silicone molds patterned with complicated adhesive microstructures against highly adhesive polyurethane acrylates. Using the proposed process, the silicone mold demonstrates high durability up to 1000 cycles without significant degradation of the adhesion performance of the printed microstructures.

Semiconductor Devices
In article 2208698, Janio Venturini, Tom Nilges, and co&#8208;workers report on the first position&#8208; and direction&#8208;flexible diode made solely from Ag18Cu3Te11Cl3. A temperature gradient of a few degrees around room temperature is sufficient to switch between p&#8208; and n&#8208;type conduction, controlling the existence, position, and current flow direction in the device.

Interfacial Dynamics
In article number 2207835, Hsien&#8208;Yi Hsu and co&#8208;workers systematically study interfacial dynamics of bandgap funnelling in MA3Bi2Cl9&#8722;xIx perovskites using temperature&#8208;dependent transient photoluminescence and electrochemical voltammetric techniques. The photophysical and (photo)electrochemical phenomena of solid&#8211;solid and solid&#8211;liquid interfaces are therefore confirmed. The importance of this work is to explore the intrinsic and interfacial properties of semiconductor materials for elucidating the correlation between material characterization and device performance.

Strain Sensing
In article number 2207141, Yongsong Luo, Xiaoliang Chen, Jinyou Shao, and co&#8208;workers propose a gated microchannel&#8208;based strain&#8208;sensing strategy inspired by ion channels in living organisms. Discretely distributed micropillars are introduced into fluidic channels to act as smart gates, which can nearly cut off the ion pathways during contraction and closure, resulting in ultrahigh sensitivity and robust stability.

         <title>All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Thin Film Lithium/Lithium&#8208;Ion Microbatteries for Powering the Internet of Things</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state thin film lithium/lithium&#8208;ion microbatteries (TFBs) are regarded as the ideal on&#8208;chip power sources for powering the microelectronic devices in Internet of Things. Recent progress in preparation techniques, materials design, interface modification, strategy for improving energy density, and multiple functionalities of TFBs is comprehensively summarized and discussed, and an overview of challenges and future perspectives is provided.








Abstract
As the world steps into the era of Internet of Things (IoT), numerous miniaturized electronic devices requiring autonomous micropower sources will be connected to the internet. All&#8208;solid&#8208;state thin&#8208;film lithium/lithium&#8208;ion microbatteries (TFBs) combining solid&#8208;state battery architecture and thin&#8208;film manufacturing are regarded as ideal on&#8208;chip power sources for IoT&#8208;enabled microelectronic devices. However, unlike commercialized lithium&#8208;ion batteries, TFBs are still in the immature state, and new advances in materials, manufacturing, and structure are required to improve their performance. In this review, the current status and existing challenges of TFBs for practical application in internet&#8208;connected devices for the IoT are discussed. Recent progress in thin&#8208;film deposition, electrode and electrolyte materials, interface modification, and 3D architecture design is comprehensively summarized and discussed, with emphasis on state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies to improve the areal capacity and cycling stability of TFBs. Moreover, to be suitable power sources for IoT devices, the design of next&#8208;generation TFBs should consider multiple functionalities, including wide working temperature range, good flexibility, high transparency, and integration with energy&#8208;harvesting systems. Perspectives on designing practically accessible TFBs are provided, which may guide the future development of reliable power sources for IoT devices.

The phase transition, multiple valence bands, and resonant bonding endow GeTe with promising thermoelectric performance. Significant breakthroughs are achieved in GeTe&#8208;based materials. This review summarizes the recent progress in developing high&#8208;performance GeTe&#8208;based materials and devices, including the underlying fundamentals, large&#8208;scale production, novel strategies for boosting performance, and techniques of device assembly.








Abstract
Driven by the intensive efforts in the development of high&#8208;performance GeTe thermoelectrics for mass&#8208;market application in power generation and refrigeration, GeTe&#8208;based materials display a high figure of merit of &gt;2.0 and an energy conversion efficiency beyond 10%. However, a comprehensive review on GeTe, from fundamentals to devices, is still needed. In this regard, the latest progress on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art GeTe is timely reviewed. The phase transition, intrinsic high carrier concentration, and multiple band edges of GeTe are fundamentally analyzed from the perspectives of the native atomic orbital, chemical bonding, and lattice defects. Then, the fabrication methods are summarized with a focus on large&#8208;scale production. Afterward, the strategies for enhancing electronic transports of GeTe by energy filtering effect, resonance doping, band convergence, and Rashba band splitting, and the methods for strengthening phonon scatterings via nanoprecipitates, planar vacancies, and superlattices, are comprehensively reviewed. Besides, the device assembly and performance are highlighted. In the end, future research directions are concluded and proposed, which enlighten the development of broader thermoelectric materials.

         <title>Filler&#8208;Integrated Composite Polymer Electrolyte for Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A critical overview on filler&#8208;integrated composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) for solid&#8208;state lithium batteries is provided. The categories of fillers and their mechanisms in enhancing ionic conductivity are briefly summarized. Rational design of filler&#8211;polymer interface and filler&#8208;promoted electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface is further elaborated. Challenges and directions are outlined, especially a future vision for developing advanced CPEs for high&#8208;performing SSLBs is proposed.








Abstract
Composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) utilizing fillers as the promoting component bridge the gap between solid polymer electrolytes and inorganic solid electrolytes. The integration of fillers into the polymer matrices is demonstrated as a prevailing strategy to enhance Li&#8208;ion transport and assist in constructing Li+&#8208;conducting electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface layer, which addresses the two key barriers of solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (SSLBs): low ionic conductivity of electrolyte and high interfacial impedance. Recent review articles have largely focused on the performance of a broad spectrum of CPEs and the general effects of fillers on SSLBs device. Recognizing this, in this review, after briefly presenting the categories of fillers (traditional and emerged) and the promoted ionic conducting mechanisms in CPEs, the progress in the interfacial structure design principle, with the emphasis on the crucial influence of filler size, concentration, and hybridization strategies on filler&#8211;polymer interface that is the most critical to Li&#8208;ion transport is assessed. The latest exciting advances on filler&#8208;enabled in situ generation of a Li+&#8208;conductive layer at the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface to greatly reduce the interfacial impedance are further elaborated. Finally, this review discusses the challenges to be addressed, outlines research directions, and provides a future vision for developing advanced CPEs for high&#8208;performing SSLBs.

         <title>Fully Optical in Operando Investigation of Ambient Condition Electrical Switching in MoS2 Nanodevices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically thin MoS2 electrical switches are characterized for the first time in operando and in ambient conditions through a non&#8208;invasive spectroscopy&#8208;based method. The study sheds light on the &#8211; controversial and still debated &#8211; dynamics driving the switching mechanism. It reveals volatile metallic filaments percolating interatomic spacing in MoS2 and stresses the impact of transfer residues on the electrical performance of switches.








Abstract
MoS2 nanoswitches have shown superb ultralow switching energies without excessive leakage currents. However, the debate about the origin and volatility of electrical switching is unresolved due to the lack of adequate nanoimaging of devices in operando. Here, three optical techniques are combined to perform the first noninvasive in situ characterization of nanosized MoS2 devices. This study reveals volatile threshold resistive switching due to the intercalation of metallic atoms from electrodes directly between Mo and S atoms, without the assistance of sulfur vacancies. A &#8220;semi&#8208;memristive&#8221; effect driven by an organic adlayer adjacent to MoS2 is observed, which suggests that nonvolatility can be achieved by careful interface engineering. These findings provide a crucial understanding of nanoprocess in vertically biased MoS2 nanosheets, which opens new routes to conscious engineering and optimization of 2D electronics.

         <title>Fast and Dynamic Mapping of the Protein Corona on Nanoparticle Surfaces by Photocatalytic Proximity Labeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein corona broadly affects the delivery of nanomedicines in vivo. Here, a photocatalytic proximity labeling technology in nanoparticles (nano&#8208;PPL) is developed for in situ labeling of corona proteins. Nano&#8208;PPL exhibits a significantly improved temporal resolution (5 s duration) and reveals precise dynamics of protein coronas on anionic and cationic nanoparticles. This technology represents a significant methodological advance toward nano&#8208;protein interactions.








Abstract
Protein corona broadly affects the delivery of nanomedicines in vivo. Although it has been widely studied by multiple strategies like centrifugal sedimentation, the rapidly forming mechanism and the dynamic structure of the protein corona at the seconds level remains challenging. Here, a photocatalytic proximity labeling technology in nanoparticles (nano&#8208;PPL) is developed. By fabricating a &#8220;core&#8208;shell&#8221; nanoparticle co&#8208;loaded with chlorin e6 catalyst and biotin&#8208;phenol probe, nano&#8208;PPL technology is validated for the rapid and precise labeling of corona proteins in situ. Nano&#8208;PPL significantly improves the temporal resolution of nano&#8208;protein interactions to 5 s duration compared with the classical centrifugation method (&gt;30 s duration). Furthermore, nano&#8208;PPL achieves the fast and dynamic mapping of the protein corona on anionic and cationic nanoparticles, respectively. Finally, nano&#8208;PPL is deployed to verify the effect of the rapidly formed protein corona on the initial interaction of nanoparticles with cells. These findings highlight a significant methodological advance toward nano&#8208;protein interactions in the delivery of nanomedicines in vivo.

         <title>Holographically Activatable Nanoprobe via Glutathione/Albumin&#8208;Mediated Exponential Signal Amplification for High&#8208;Contrast Tumor Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A holographically activatable nanoprobe caging manganese tetraoxide is reported for tumor&#8208;selective contrast enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging, which is accomplished through both glutathione/albumin&#8208;mediated cascade signal amplification in tumors and rapid elimination in normal tissues.








Abstract
Glutathione (GSH)&#8208;activatable probes hold great promise for in vivo cancer imaging, but are restricted by their dependence on non&#8208;selective intracellular GSH enrichment and uncontrollable background noise. Here, a holographically activatable nanoprobe caging manganese tetraoxide is shown for tumor&#8208;selective contrast enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) through cooperative GSH/albumin&#8208;mediated cascade signal amplification in tumors and rapid elimination in normal tissues. Once targeting tumors, the endocytosed nanoprobe effectively senses the lysosomal microenvironment to undergo instantaneous decomposition into Mn2+ with threshold GSH concentration of &#8776; 0.12&#160;mm for brightening MRI signals, thus achieving high contrast tumor imaging and flexible monitoring of GSH&#8208;relevant cisplatin resistance during chemotherapy. Upon efficient up&#8208;regulation of extracellular GSH in&#160;tumor via exogenous injection, the relaxivity&#8208;silent interstitial nanoprobe remarkably evolves into Mn2+ that are further captured/retained and re&#8208;activated into ultrahigh&#8208;relaxivity&#8208;capable complex by stromal albumin in the tumor, and simultaneously allows the renal clearance of off&#8208;targeted nanoprobe in the form of Mn2+ via lymphatic vessels for suppressing background noise to distinguish tiny liver metastasis. These findings demonstrate the concept of holographic tumor activation via both tumor GSH/albumin&#8208;mediated cascade signal amplification and simultaneous background suppression for precise tumor malignancy detection, surveillance, and surgical guidance.

Here, a holographically activatable nanoprobe caging manganese tetraoxide is shown for tumor-selective contrast enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) through cooperative GSH/albumin-mediated cascade signal amplification in tumors and rapid elimination in normal tissues. Once targeting tumors, the endocytosed nanoprobe effectively senses the lysosomal microenvironment to undergo instantaneous decomposition into Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; with threshold GSH concentration of &#8776; 0.12&#160;m&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; for brightening MRI signals, thus achieving high contrast tumor imaging and flexible monitoring of GSH-relevant cisplatin resistance during chemotherapy. Upon efficient up-regulation of extracellular GSH in&#160;tumor via exogenous injection, the relaxivity-silent interstitial nanoprobe remarkably evolves into Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; that are further captured/retained and re-activated into ultrahigh-relaxivity-capable complex by stromal albumin in the tumor, and simultaneously allows the renal clearance of off-targeted nanoprobe in the form of Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; via lymphatic vessels for suppressing background noise to distinguish tiny liver metastasis. These findings demonstrate the concept of holographic tumor activation via both tumor GSH/albumin-mediated cascade signal amplification and simultaneous background suppression for precise tumor malignancy detection, surveillance, and surgical guidance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Semi&#8208;Transparent, Chiral Organic Photodiodes with Incident Direction&#8208;Dependent Selectivity for Circularly Polarized Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semi&#8208;transparent organic photodiodes containing chiral non&#8208;fullerene acceptor and achiral polymer donor respond differently to left and right circularly polarized light. The preference switches when changing the direction of the incoming light. Circular selective absorption in combination with selective collection of carriers from a narrow space charge region can account for the change in polarization.








Abstract
Detection of the circular polarization of light is possible using chiral semiconductors, yet the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Semi&#8208;transparent chiral photodiodes allow for a simple experiment to investigate the basis of their selectivity: changing the side from which the diode is illuminated. A reversal of circular selectivity is observed in photocurrent generation when changing the direction of illumination on organic, bulk&#8208;heterojunction cells. The change in selectivity can be explained by a space&#8208;charge limitation on the collection of photocarriers in combination with preferential absorption of one of the circular polarizations of near&#8208;infrared light by the chiral non&#8208;fullerene acceptor. The space&#8208;charge limitation is supported by detailed measurements of frequency and intensity dependence of dc and ac photocurrents.

         <title>Ion&#8208;selective Microporous Polymer Membranes with Hydrogen&#8208;bond and Salt&#8208;bridge Networks for Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Redox flow batteries (RFBs) have great potential for long&#8208;duration grid&#8208;scale energy storage. Ion conducting membranes are a crucial component in RFBs, allowing charge&#8208;carrying ions to transport while preventing the cross&#8208;mixing of redox couples. Commercial Nafion membranes are widely used in RFBs, but their unsatisfactory ionic and molecular selectivity as well as high costs limit the performance and the widespread deployment of this technology. To extend the longevity and reduce the cost of RFB systems, inexpensive ion&#8208;selective membranes are highly desired that concurrently deliver low ionic resistance and high selectivity towards redox&#8208;active species. In this work, high&#8208;performance RFB membranes are fabricated from blends of carboxylate&#8208; and amidoxime&#8208;functionalized polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) that exploit the beneficial properties of both polymers. The enthalpy&#8208;driven formation of cohesive interchain interactions, including hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, facilitates the microscopic miscibility of the blends, while ionizable functional groups within the sub&#8208;nanometer pores allow optimization of membrane ion transport functions. The resulting microporous membranes demonstrate fast cation conduction with low crossover of redox&#8208;active molecular species, enabling improved power ratings and reduced capacity fade in aqueous RFBs using anthraquinone and ferrocyanide as redox couples.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Transfer of Freestanding Large&#8208;Area Conjugated Polymer Films for Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Conventional processes for depositing thin films of conjugated polymers are restricted to those based on vapor, liquid, and solution&#8208;phase precursors. Each of these methods bear some limitations. For example, low&#8208;bandgap polymers with alternating donor&#8208;acceptor structures cannot be deposited from the vapor phase, and solution&#8208;phase deposition is always subject to issues related to the incompatibility of the substrate with the solvent. Here, we&#160;demonstrate a technique to enable deposition of large&#8208;area, ultra&#8208;thin films (ca. 20 nm or more), which are transferred from the surface of water. From the water, these pre&#8208;solidified films can then be transferred to a desired substrate, circumventing limitations such as solvent orthogonality. The quality of these films is characterized by a variety of imaging and electrochemical measurements. Mechanical toughness was&#160;identified as a limiting property of polymer compatibility, along with some strategies to address this limitation. As a demonstration, the films are used as the hole&#8208;transport layer in perovskite solar cells, in which their performance is shown to be comparable to controls formed by&#160;spin&#8208;coating.

         <title>Colloid Electrolyte with Changed Li+ Solvation Structure for High&#8208;Power, Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) currently suffer from low capacity and fast degradation under fast charging and/or low temperatures. Herein, we design a colloid liquid electrolyte (CLE) where a trace amount of lithium thiocarbonate (LTC) colloids in commercial carbonate electrolyte (1&#160;M LiPF6 in EC/DMC) not only boosts up &#963;Li+ but also improves the Li+ transfer kinetics at LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 (NCA) cathode/electrolyte interface. The competitive coordination of LTCs with anions and solvents facilitates the dissociation of lithium salts and Li+ decoupling, dramatically enhancing the &#963;Li+ (15 to 4.5 mS cm&#8722;1 at 30 and &#8208;20&#160;&#176;C, respectively); meanwhile, the desolvation process is accelerated. It demonstrates that LTC colloids induce &#8764;5&#160;nm ultra&#8208;thin Li2CO3&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interface (CEI), infuse the grain boundary of NCA particles, enhancing interfacial Li+ transfer and inhibiting the particle cracks during cycling. Consequently, the Li||CLE||NCA battery delivers a maximum capacity of 135 mAh g&#8722;1 at a 10 C rate with 80% retention after 2000 cycles. Moreover, the fast&#8208;charging capability under a sub&#8208;zero environment is proved (122 mAh g&#8722;1 with 90% retention after 400 cycles at 2 C and &#8208;10&#160;&#176;C). Our strategy for tailoring the interfacial charge transfer appears generalizable and can practically be extended to the next&#8208;generation energy storage systems.

         <title>Precisely Controllable Artificial Muscle with Continuous Morphing based on &#8220;Breathing&#8221; of Supramolecular Columns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Skeletal muscles are natural motors executing sophisticated work through precise control of linear contraction. Although various liquid crystal polymers&#8208;based artificial muscles have been designed, the mechanism based on mainly the order&#8208;disorder transition usually leads to discrete shape morphing, leaving arbitrary and precise deformation a huge challenge. Here, we present one novel photo&#8208;responsive hemiphasmidic side&#8208;chain liquid crystal polymer with a unique &#8220;breathing&#8221; columnar phase that enables continuous morphing. Due to confinement inside the supramolecular columnar assembly, the cooperative movements of side&#8208;chains and backbones generates a significant negative thermal expansion and leads to temperature&#8208;controllable muscle&#8208;like elongation/contraction in the oriented polymer strip. The irreversible isomerization of the photo&#8208;responsive mesogens result in the synergistic phototunable bending and high&#8208;contrast fluorescence change. Based on the orthogonal responses to heat and light, we further demonstrate controllable arm&#8208;like bending motions of this material, which is applicable in constructing advanced artificial muscles or intelligent soft robotics.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Emerging piezocatalysts have demonstrated their remarkable application potentials in diverse medical fields. In addition to their ultrahigh catalytic activities, their inherent and unique charge carrier&#8208;releasing properties can be used to initiate various redox catalytic reactions, displaying bright prospects for future medical applications. Triggered by mechanical energy, piezocatalytic materials can release electrons/holes, catalyze redox reactions of substrates or intervene in biological processes to promote the production of effector molecules for medical purposes, such as decontamination, sterilization, and therapy. Such a medical application of piezocatalysis is termed as piezocatalytic medicine (PCM) herein. To pioneer novel medical technologies, especially therapeutic modalities, this review provides an overview of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art research progresses in piezocatalytic medicine. First, the principle of piezocatalysis and the preparation methodologies of piezoelectric materials will be introduced. Then, we provide a comprehensive summary of the medical applications of piezocatalytic materials in tumor treatment, antisepsis, organic degradation, tissue repair and regeneration, and biosensing. Finally, the main challenges and future perspectives in piezocatalytic medicine are discussed and proposed, expecting to fuel the development of this emerging scientific discipline.

         <title>Engineering Human Brain Assembloids by Microfluidics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Brain assembloids offer a highly promising strategy to model human brain development and disease, and advance potential studies in regenerative medicine, therapeutic screening and drug discovery, while it is challenging to produce uniform brain organoids and assemble them flexibly by conventional methods. Here, we present a multidisciplinary engineered strategy to generate human brain assembloids with desired patterning based on microfluidic technology. By encapsulating human induced pluripotent stem cells in microcapsules via microfluidic electrospray, brain region&#8208;specific organoids are efficiently formed, which are then introduced into a microfluidic chip consisting of a bottom layer with a micropillar array and a movable upper layer with a complementary microhole array. These brain organoids can settle into microholes and fuse into brain assembloids. As varied organoid microcapsules with designed 1D sequences or 2D arrays could be assembled into the vertical microholes, large coding amounts of fused brain assembloids with desired patterning could be produced. We have found that brain assembloids composed of cortical, hippocampal, and thalamic organoids could grow and function well, characterized with active neural migration and interaction. These features indicated that the suggested flexible, scalable and controlled microfluidic systems are remarkably potential in wide applications of brain assembloids in neurological and biomedical fields.

         <title>Progress of Microfluidic Hydrogel&#8208;based Scaffolds and Organ&#8208;on&#8208;Chips for the Cartilage Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Cartilage degeneration is among the fundamental reasons behind disability and pain across the globe. Numerous approaches have been employed to treat cartilage diseases. Nevertheless, none have shown acceptable outcomes in the long run. In this regard, the convergence of tissue engineering and microfabrication principles can allow developing more advanced microfluidic technologies, thus offering attractive alternatives to current treatments and traditional constructs that have been used in tissue engineering applications. Herein, the current developments involving microfluidic hydrogel&#8208;based scaffolds, promising structures for cartilage regeneration, ranging from hydrogels with microfluidic channels to hydrogels prepared by the microfluidic devices, that enable therapeutic delivery of cells, drugs, and growth factors, as well as cartilage&#8208;related organ&#8208;on&#8208;chips are reviewed. Thereafter, cartilage anatomy and types of damage, and present treatment options are briefly overviewed. The various types of hydrogels are introduced, and the advantages of microfluidic hydrogel&#8208;based scaffolds and hydrogel&#8208;based microfluidic platforms over traditional hydrogels are thoroughly discussed. Furthermore, available technologies for fabricating microfluidic hydrogel&#8208;based scaffolds and microfluidic chips are presented. The preclinical and clinical applications of microfluidic hydrogel&#8208;based scaffolds in cartilage regeneration and the development of cartilage&#8208;related microfluidic chips over time are further explained. The current developments, recent key challenges, and attractive prospects that should be considered so as to develop transitional microfluidic systems in cartilage repair are also highlighted and discussed in depth.

         <title>Direct Visualization of Localized Vibrations At Complex Grain Boundaries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Grain boundaries (GBs) are a prolific microstructural feature that dominates the functionality of a wide class of materials. The functionality at a GB results from unique atomic arrangements, different from those in the grain, that have driven extensive experimental and theoretical studies correlating atomic&#8208;scale GB structures to macroscopic electronic, infrared&#8208;optical, and thermal properties.[8] Here, we examine a SrTiO3 GB using atomic&#8208;resolution aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and ultrahigh&#8208;energy&#8208;resolution monochromated electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy (EELS), in conjunction with density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory (DFT). This combination enables the correlation of the GB structure, nonstoichiometry, and chemical bonding with a redistribution of vibrational states within the GB dislocation&#8208;cores. The new experimental access to localized GB vibrations provides a direct route to quantifying the impact of individual boundaries on macroscopic properties.

         <title>Terahertz Nonlinear Hall Rectifiers Based on Spin&#8208;Polarized 1T&#8208;CoTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The zero magnetic&#8208;field nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) refers to the second&#8208;order transverse current induced by an applied alternating electric field; it indicates the topological properties of inversion&#8208;breaking crystals. Despite several studies on the NLHE induced by the Berry&#8208;curvature dipole in Weyl semimetals, the direct current conversion by rectification is limited to very low driving frequencies and cryogenic temperatures. The nonlinear photoresponse generated by the NLHE at room temperature can be useful for numerous applications in communication, sensing, and photodetection across a high bandwidth. In this study, we report observations of the second&#8208;order NLHE in type&#8208;II Dirac semimetal CoTe2 under time&#8208;reversal symmetry. This was determined by the disorder&#8208;induced extrinsic contribution on the broken&#8208;inversion&#8208;symmetry surface and room temperature terahertz rectification without the need of semiconductor junctions or bias voltage. We show that remarkable photoresponsivity over 0.1 A W&#8722;1, a response time of approximately 710&#160;ns, and a mean noise equivalent power of 1 pW Hz&#8722;1/2 can be achieved at room temperature. Our results open a new pathway for low&#8208;energy photon harvesting via nonlinear rectification induced by the NLHE in strongly spin&#8208;orbit coupled and inversion&#8208;breaking systems, promising a considerable impact in the field of infrared/terahertz photonics.

         <title>Stabilizing Single&#8208;Atomic Pt by Forming Pt&#8208;Fe Bond for Efficient Diboration of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Precisely tailoring the oxidation state of single&#8208;atomic metal in heterogeneous catalysis is an efficient way to stabilize the single&#8208;atomic site and promote their activity, but realizing this approach remains to be a grand challenge to date. Herein, we report a class of stable single&#8208;atomic catalysts with well&#8208;tuned oxidation state of Pt by forming Pt&#8208;Fe atomic bond, which are supported by defective Fe2O3 nanosheets on reduced graphene oxide (PFARFNs). These as&#8208;synthesized materials could greatly enhance the catalytic activity, stability and selectivity for the diboration of alkynes. The PFARFNs exhibit high conversion of 99% at 100&#160;&#176;C with an outstanding turnover frequency (TOF) of 545 h&#8722;1, and a relatively high conversion of 58% at room temperature (25&#160;&#176;C) with a TOF of 310 h&#8722;1, which was hardly achieved before. Through both experimental and theoretical investigation, we demonstrate that the fast electron transfer from Fe to Pt in Fe&#8208;Pt&#8208;O atomic sites in PFARFNs can not only stabilize the single&#8208;atomic Pt, but also significantly improve their catalytic activity.

         <title>Boosting Photocatalytic Water Oxidation on Photocatalysts with Ferroelectric Single&#8208;domain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ferroelectric materials are considered as the promising photocatalysts due to their efficient charge separation via polarization&#8208;induced built&#8208;in electric field. However, the polydomain structures hinder the spatial charge separation and transfer due to the cancellation of polarization vectors in the domains. Herein, taking BiFeO3 (BFO) as a prototype, single&#8208;domain BFO nanosheets with visible&#8208;light absorption are prepared, as evident by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), spatially resolved surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SRSPS), and photo&#8208;deposition experiments. The single&#8208;domain BFO nanosheets show nine times activity in photocatalytic water oxidation reaction under visible&#8208;light irradiation, compared with that of the polydomain BFO particles. With the asymmetric driving force for charge separation in a single domain, selective deposition of cocatalysts further enhances the photocatalytic activity of single&#8208;domain ferroelectric BFO nanosheets. These results demonstrate the role of single&#8208;domain structure in constructing the driving force of charge separation in ferroelectric photocatalysts. The fabrication of single&#8208;domain structures in ferroelectric photocatalysts to achieve enhanced photocatalytic activity offers a path to efficiently utilize the photogenerated charges in solar energy conversion.

         <title>Multifunctional 3D&#8208;Printed Pollen Grain&#8208;Inspired Hydrogel Microrobots for On&#8208;Demand Anchoring and Cargo Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional hydrogel microrobot is created by different stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels with pollen grain&#8208;inspired microstructures. The robot is capable of conducting temperature&#8208;responsive on&#8208;demand surface attachment, magnetic locomotion, and pH&#8208;responsive cargo delivery toward biomedical applications.








Abstract
While a majority of wireless microrobots have shown multi&#8208;responsiveness to implement complex biomedical functions, their functional executions are strongly dependent on the range of stimulus inputs, which curtails their functional diversity. Furthermore, their responsive functions are coupled to each other, which results in the overlap of the task operations. Here, a 3D&#8208;printed multifunctional microrobot inspired by pollen grains with three hydrogel components is demonstrated: iron platinum (FePt) nanoparticle&#8208;embedded pentaerythritol triacrylate (PETA), poly N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide (pNIPAM), and poly N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide acrylic acid (pNIPAM&#8208;AAc) structures. Each of these structures exhibits their respective targeted functions: responding to magnetic fields for torque&#8208;driven surface rolling and steering, exhibiting temperature responsiveness for on&#8208;demand surface attachment (anchoring), and pH&#8208;responsive cargo release. The versatile multifunctional pollen grain&#8208;inspired robots conceptualized here pave the way for various future medical microrobots to improve their projected performance and functional diversity.

         <title>Weakening Li+ De&#8208;solvation Barrier for Cryogenic Li&#8211;S Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antecedent theoretical simulations decipher the correlation between lithium salt concentration and Li+ desolvation barrier in the electrolyte, indicating dilute electrolytes can enhance kinetics of sulfur cathode effectively. This insight endows Li&#8211;S pouch cells with an ultra&#8208;high energy density of 350 Wh kg&#8208;1 at 0 &#176;C, demonstrating great&#160;potential for&#160;cryogenic&#160;Li&#8211;S&#160;batteries.








Abstract
Li&#8211;S batteries hold promise for pushing cell&#8208;level energy densities beyond 300&#160;Wh kg&#8208;1 while operating at low temperatures (LTs, below 0&#160;&#176;C). However, the capacity release of existing Li&#8211;S batteries at LTs is still barely satisfactory, and there is almost no verification of the practicability of Li&#8211;S batteries at LTs in the Ah&#8208;level pouch cell. Here, antecedent molecular dynamics (MDs) combined with density functional theory analysis are used to systematically investigate Li+ solvation structure in conventional Li&#8211;S batteries at LTs, which unprecedentedly reveals the positive correlation between lithium salt concentration and Li+ de&#8208;solvation barrier, indicating dilute electrolytes can enhance the Li+ de&#8208;solvation kinetics and thus improve the capacity performance of cryogenic Li&#8211;S batteries. These insights derived from theoretical simulations invested Li&#8211;S batteries with a 67.34% capacity retention at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C compared to their room temperature performance. In particular, an Ah&#8208;level Li&#8211;S pouch cell using dilute electrolytes with a high sulfur loading (5.6&#160;mg cm&#8208;2) and lean electrolyte condition is fabricated, which delivers a discharge capacity of about 1000 mAh g&#8208;1 and ultra&#8208;high energy density of 350&#160;Wh kg&#8208;1 at 0&#160;&#176;C, offering a promising route toward a practical high&#8208;energy cryogenic Li&#8211;S battery.

         <title>Stem Cell Membrane&#8208;Coated Microribbon Scaffolds Induce Regenerative Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses in a Critical&#8208;Size Cranial Bone Defect Model</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell membrane coating represents a biomimetic strategy for modifying the surface of biomaterials. Coating macroporous microribbon scaffolds with mesenchymal stem cell membrane (MSCM) enhances cranial bone healing via immunomodulation. Primed MSCM&#8208;coating contains ligands that promote M&#966; polarization toward M2, induce Treg differentiation and TCD8+ apoptosis, and enhance MSC osteogenesis. MSCM coating synergizes with BMP&#8208;2 to further accelerate bone regeneration while suppressing inflammation.








Abstract
Naturally&#8208;derived cell membranes have shown great promise in functionalizing nanoparticles to enhance biointerfacing functions for drug delivery applications. However, its potential for functionalizing macroporous scaffolds to enhance tissue regeneration in vivo remains unexplored. Engineering scaffolds with immunomodulatory functions represents an exciting strategy for tissue regeneration but is largely limited to soft tissues. Critical&#8208;sized bone defects cannot heal on their own, and the role of adaptive immune cells in scaffold&#8208;mediated healing of cranial bone defects remains largely unknown. Here, mensenchymal stem cell membrane (MSCM)&#8208;coated microribbon (&#181;RB) scaffolds for treating critical size cranial bone defects via targeting immunomodulation are reported. Confocal imaging and proteomic analyses are used to confirm successful coating and characterize the compositions of cell membrane coating. It is demonstrated that MSCM coating promotes macrophage (M&#966;) polarization toward regenerative phenotype, induces CD8+ T cell apoptosis, and enhances regulatory T cell differentiation in vitro and in vivo. When combined with a low dosage of BMP&#8208;2, MSCM coating further accelerates bone regeneration and suppresses inflammation. These results establish cell membrane&#8208;coated microribbon scaffolds as a promising strategy for treating critical size bone defects via immunomodulation. The platform may be broadly used with different cell membranes and scaffolds to enhance regeneration of multiple tissue types.

         <title>Pyridinic Nitrogen Sites Dominated Coordinative Engineering of Subnanometric Pd Clusters for Efficient Alkynes&#8217; Semihydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridinic nitrogen&#8208;site&#8208;dominated coordinative engineering of subnanometric Pd clusters is proposed for efficient alkynes&#8217; semihydrogenation. The obtained catalyst Pd@PPy&#8208;600 exhibits excellent catalytic activity (99%) and selectivity (96%) for phenylacetylene semihydrogenation due to the abundant pyridinic nitrogen sites and interesting electron effects.








Abstract
Supported metal catalysts have played an important role in optimizing selective semihydrogenation of alkynes for fine chemicals. There into, nitrogen&#8208;doped carbons, as a type of promising support materials, have attracted extensive attentions. However, due to the general phenomenon of random doping for nitrogen species in the support, it is still atremendous challenge to finely identify which nitrogen configuration dominates the catalytic property of alkynes&#8217; semihydrogenation. Herein, it is reported that uniform mesoporous N&#8208;doped carbon spheres derived from mesoporous polypyrrole spheres are used as supports to immobilized subnanometric Pd clusters, which provide a particular platform to research the influence of nitrogen configurations on the alkynes&#8217; semihydrogenation. Comprehensive experimental results and density functional theory calculation indicate that pyridinic nitrogen configuration dominates the catalytic behavior of Pd clusters. The high contents of pyridinic nitrogen sites offer abundant coordination sites, which greatly reduces the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining reaction step and makes Pd clusters own high catalytic activity. The electron effect between pyridinic nitrogen sites and Pd clusters makes the reaction highly selective. Additionally, the good mesostructures also promote the fast transport of substrate. Based on the above, catalyst Pd@PPy&#8208;600 exhibits high catalytic activity (99%) and selectivity (96%) for phenylacetylene (C8H6) semihydrogenation.

The high contents of pyridinic nitrogen sites offer abundant coordination sites, which greatly reduces the energy barrier of the rate-determining reaction step and makes Pd clusters own high catalytic activity. The electron effect between pyridinic nitrogen sites and Pd clusters makes the reaction highly selective. Additionally, the good mesostructures also promote the fast transport of substrate. Based on the above, catalyst Pd@PPy-600 exhibits high catalytic activity (99%) and selectivity (96%) for phenylacetylene (C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) semihydrogenation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual/Triple Template&#8208;Induced Evolved Emulsion for Controllable Construction of Anisotropic Carbon Nanoparticles from Concave to Convex</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual/triple template&#8208;induced evolved emulsion strategy is developed for the precise construction of anisotropic mesoporous carbon nanoparticles. It not only endows the concave structure with adjustable size and meso&#8208;structure but also realizes the innovative transformation from concave to convex in a one&#8208;pot method. Moreover, the well&#8208;designed basin&#8208;concave and mountain&#8208;convex nanoparticles manifest excellent performance for improving drug release rate and enzyme catalytic efficiency.








Abstract
Anisotropic mesoporous carbon (AMC) nanoparticles with asymmetric external morphologies, topological internal structure, and superior performance of carbon species are attracting great attention because of their seductive features differentiating them from symmetric nanoparticles. However, a bewildering challenge but crucial desire remains to endow them with flexibly tunable morphology and pore structure. Herein, a dual/triple&#8208;templating evolved emulsion strategy for tunable fabrication of AMC nanoparticles with distinctive defined structure by interface&#8208;energy&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly is first reported based on a brand&#8208;new mechanism. It describes the possible formation process of the concave&#8208;cavity structure and allows for manipulation of the longitudinal and lateral sizes systematically by adjusting emulsion polarity and sodium oleate dosage, respectively. Interestingly, the internal pore structure can be rearranged into radial channels and the external morphology can realize structural transformation from concave to convex by innovatively introducing the third template n&#8208;hexanol, which is unprecedented at nanoscale. Remarkably, due to the excellent properties of carbon species and unique structural characteristics, AMC nanoparticles not only demonstrate good biocompatibility but also exhibit splendid performance in improving the dissolution and release rates of insoluble drug and enhancing the enzyme catalytic efficiency. Generally, this approach provides new inspiration and insights for expanding exquisite anisotropic nanomaterials for many potential applications.

         <title>Machine Learning Based Approach for Solving Atomic Structures of Nanomaterials Combining Pair Distribution Functions with Density Functional Theory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Determination of crystal structures of nanocrystalline or amorphous compounds is a great challenge in solid states chemistry and physics. Pair distribution function (PDF) analysis of X&#8208;Ray or neutron total scattering data has proven to be a key element in tackling this challenge. However, in most cases a reliable structural motif is needed as starting configuration for structure refinements. Here, we present an algorithm that is able to determine the crystal structure of an unknown compound by means of an on&#8208;the&#8208;fly trained machine learning model that combines density functional theory (DFT) calculations with comparison of calculated and measured PDFs for global optimization in an artificial landscape. Due to the nature of this landscape, even metastable configurations and stacking disorder can be determined.

         <title>Enhanced Spin Current in Ni81Fe19/Cu&#8208;CuOx Bilayer with Top and Sideway Oxidization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Generation and manipulation of spin current are the cores of spintronic devices, which are intensely pursued. Heavy metals with strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling are commonly used for the generation of spin current, but incompatible with the mass production of devices and the polarization of spin current is limited to be in&#8208;plane. Here, we show that the spin current with strong out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization component could be generated and transmitted in Ni81Fe19/Cu&#8208;CuOx bilayer with sideway and top oxidizations. The charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin current conversion efficiency could be enhanced through the spin currents consisting of both out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization (&#963;z) and in&#8208;plane polarization (&#963;y) induced by spin&#8208;vorticity coupling. Such a spin current is demonstrated to be closely related to the lateral oxidization gradient and could be controlled by changing the temperatures and times of annealing. Our finding provides a novel degree of freedom to produce and control the spin current in spintronic devices.

         <title>Rational Design of Polymethine Dyes with NIR&#8208;II Emission and High Photothermal Conversion Efficiency for Multimodal Imaging&#8208;Guided Photo&#8208;immunotherapy</title>

Abstract
Phototheranostics have emerged and flourished as a promising pattern for cancer theranostics owing to their precise photoinduced diagnosis and therapeutic to meet the demands of precision medicine. The diagnosis information and therapeutic effect are directly determined by the fluorescence imaging ability and photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of phototheranostic agents. Hence, how to balance the competitive radiative and nonradiative processes of phototheranostic agents is the key factor to evaluate the phototheranostic effect. Herein, we rationally designed molecules named ICRs with fluorescence emission in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#160;nm), exhibiting high photostability and high PCE. The optimized D&#8211;A interaction and reorganization energy of ICRs were considered to be the key factors for their high PCE. Noteworthily, ICR&#8208;Qu with stronger D&#8211;A interaction and large&#8208;sized conjugated unit encapsulated in nanoparticles exhibited high PCE (81.1%). Besides, ICR&#8208;QuNPs were used for fluorescence imaging (FLI), photoacoustic imaging (PAI), and photothermal imaging (PTI) to guide deep&#8208;tissue photonic hyperthermia, achieving precise removal and inhibition of breast cancer. Furthermore, combined with &#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;1, ICR&#8208;QuNPs showed huge potential to be a facile and efficient tool for photo&#8208;immunotherapy. More importantly, this study not only reported an &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; polymethine&#8208;based phototheranostic agent but also shed light on the exploration of versatile organic molecules for future practical applications.

         <title>Coordinatively Stiffen and Toughen Hydrogels with Adaptable Crystal&#8208;domain Cross&#8208;linking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Conventional hydrogels usually suffer from the inherent conflict between stiffness and toughness, severely hampering their applications as load&#8208;bearing materials. Herein, we reported an adaptable crystal&#8208;domain cross&#8208;linking design to overcome this inherent trade&#8208;off for hydrogels by taking full advantage of both deformation&#8208;resisting and energy&#8208;dissipating capacities of cross&#8208;linking points. Through solvent exchange to homogenize the polymer network, followed by salting out to foster crystallization, a class of sal&#8208;exogels with high number densities of uniform crystalline domains embedded in homogeneous networks was constructed. During the deformation, those adaptive crystalline domains initially survive to arrest deformation, while later disentangle gradually to efficiently dissipate energy, crucial to the realization of the desirable compatibility between stiffness and toughness. The resultant sal&#8208;exogel achieved coordinatively enhanced stiffness (52.3 &#177; 2.7&#160;MPa) and toughness (120.7 &#177; 11.7&#160;kJ/m2), reconciling the challenging trade&#8208;off between them. Our finding provides a practical and universal route to design stiff and tough hydrogels, and would have a profound impact on many applications requiring hydrogels with such combined mechanical properties.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional hydrogels usually suffer from the inherent conflict between stiffness and toughness, severely hampering their applications as load-bearing materials. Herein, we reported an adaptable crystal-domain cross-linking design to overcome this inherent trade-off for hydrogels by taking full advantage of both deformation-resisting and energy-dissipating capacities of cross-linking points. Through solvent exchange to homogenize the polymer network, followed by salting out to foster crystallization, a class of sal-exogels with high number densities of uniform crystalline domains embedded in homogeneous networks was constructed. During the deformation, those adaptive crystalline domains initially survive to arrest deformation, while later disentangle gradually to efficiently dissipate energy, crucial to the realization of the desirable compatibility between stiffness and toughness. The resultant sal-exogel achieved coordinatively enhanced stiffness (52.3 &#177; 2.7&#160;MPa) and toughness (120.7 &#177; 11.7&#160;kJ/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), reconciling the challenging trade-off between them. Our finding provides a practical and universal route to design stiff and tough hydrogels, and would have a profound impact on many applications requiring hydrogels with such combined mechanical properties.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>High Durability of Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C Single Atom Catalysts with Carbon Vacancies Towards Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Single atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted extensive interest to catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries. However, the development of SACs with high selectivity and long&#8208;term stability is a great challenge. In this work, we practically designed and synthesized carbon vacancy modified Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C SACs (FeH&#8208;N&#8208;C) through microenvironment modulation, achieving high&#8208;efficient utilization of active sites and optimization of electronic structures. The FeH&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst exhibited a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.91&#160;V and sufficient durability of 100,000 voltage cycles with 29&#160;mV E1/2 loss. Density functional theory calculations confirmed the vacancies around metal&#8208;N4 sites can reduce the adsorption free energy of OH*, and hinder the dissolution of metal centre, significantly enhancing the ORR kinetics and stability. Accordingly, FeH&#8208;N&#8208;C SACs presented a high&#8208;power density and long&#8208;term stability over 1200&#160;h in rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries. This work will not only guide for developing highly active and stable SACs through rational modulation of metal&#8208;N4 sites, but also provide an insight into the optimization of the electronic structure to boost electro&#8208;catalytical performances.

         <title>Dense Arrays of Nanohelices: Raman Scattering from Achiral Molecules Reveals the Near&#8208;field Enhancements at Chiral Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Against the background of the current healthcare and climate emergencies, surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is becoming a highly topical technique for identifying and fingerprinting molecules, e.g. within viruses, bacteria, drugs, and atmospheric aerosols. Crucial for SERS is the need for substrates with strong and reproducible enhancements of the Raman signal over large areas and with a low fabrication cost. Here, we investigate dense arrays of plasmonic nanohelices (&#8764;100 nm in length) that are of interest for many advanced nanophotonics applications, and we show that they present excellent SERS properties. As an illustration, we present two new ways to probe near&#8208;field enhancement generated with circular polarization at chiral metasurfaces, first using the Raman spectra of achiral molecules (crystal violet) and second using a single, element&#8208;specific, achiral molecular vibrational mode (i.e. a single Raman peak). The nanohelices can be fabricated over large areas at a low cost and they provide strong, robust and uniform Raman enhancement. We anticipate that these advanced materials will find broad applications in surface enhanced Raman spectroscopies and material science.

         <title>Super&#8208;Resolution Detection of DNA Nanostructures Using a Nanopore</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High&#8208;resolution analysis of biomolecules has brought unprecedented insights into fundamental biological processes and dramatically advanced biosensing. Notwithstanding the ongoing resolution revolution in electron microscopy and optical imaging, only a few methods are presently available for high&#8208;resolution analysis of unlabelled single molecules in their native states. Here, we demonstrate label&#8208;free electrical sensing of structured single molecules with a spatial resolution down to single&#8208;digit nanometres. Using a narrow solid&#8208;state nanopore, we detect the passage of a series of nanostructures attached to a freely translocating DNA molecule, resolving individual nanostructures placed as close as 6&#160;nm apart and with a surface&#8208;to&#8208;surface gap distance of only 2&#160;nm. We attribute such super&#8208;resolution ability to the nanostructure&#8208;induced enhancement of the electric field at the tip of the nanopore. Our work demonstrates a general approach to improving the resolution of single&#8208;molecule nanopore sensing and presents a critical advance towards label&#8208;free, high&#8208;resolution DNA sequence mapping and digital information storage independent of molecular motors.

         <title>Progress, Challenges, and Opportunities in Oxide Semiconductor Devices: A Key Building Block for Applications Ranging from Display Backplanes to 3D Integrated Semiconductor Chips</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fundamentals of oxide semiconductors are addressed, including a brief history, the function of the constituents and defects, transport mechanisms, and reliability issues. Furthermore, recent achievements of oxide semiconductor transistors are reviewed, and their potential for monolithic 3D integration are introduced. Finally, remaining questions and future directions of oxide semiconductor devices are discussed for next&#8208;generation electronics.








Abstract
As Si has faced physical limits on further scaling down, novel semiconducting materials such as 2D transition metal dichalcogenides and oxide semiconductors (OSs) have gained tremendous attention to continue the ever&#8208;demanding downscaling represented by Moore's law. Among them, OS is considered to be the most promising alternative material because it has intriguing features such as modest mobility, extremely low off&#8208;current, great uniformity, and low&#8208;temperature processibility with conventional complementary&#8208;metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor&#8208;compatible methods. In practice, OS has successfully replaced hydrogenated amorphous Si in high&#8208;end liquid crystal display devices and has now become a standard backplane electronic for organic light&#8208;emitting diode displays despite the short time since their invention in 2004. For OS to be implemented in next&#8208;generation electronics such as back&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line transistor applications in monolithic 3D integration beyond the display applications, however, there is still much room for further study, such as high mobility, immune short&#8208;channel effects, low electrical contact properties, etc. This study reviews the brief history of OS and recent progress in device applications from a material science and device physics point of view. Simultaneously, remaining challenges and opportunities in OS for use in next&#8208;generation electronics are discussed.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Ionizable Iron Nanoadjuvant Augments STING Activation for Personalized Vaccination Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acid&#8208;ionizable iron nanoadjuvant (PEIM) is developed to potentiate cancer vaccination immunotherapy. PEIM nanoadjuvant is coassembled from acid&#8208;ionizable&#160;copolymers with iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) and a stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist. PEIM nanoadjuvant effectively delivers tumor antigens to lymph nodes, amplifies STING activation and type&#8208;I interferon (IFN&#8208;I) production, and ultimately&#160;elicits antigen&#8208;specific T&#8208;cell response to inhibit tumor growth.








Abstract
The critical challenge for cancer vaccine&#8208;induced T&#8208;cell immunity is the sustained activation of antigen cross&#8208;presentation in antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs) with innate immune stimulation. In this study, it is first discovered that the clinically used magnetic contrast agents, iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs), markedly augment the type&#8208;I interferon (IFN&#8208;I) production profile of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist MSA&#8208;2 and achieve a 16&#8208;fold dosage&#8208;sparing effect in the human STING haplotype. Acid&#8208;ionizable copolymers are coassembled with IONPs and MSA&#8208;2 into iron nanoadjuvants to concentrate STING activation in the draining lymph nodes. The top candidate iron nanoadjuvant (PEIM) efficiently delivers the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) to CD169+ APCs and facilitates antigen cross&#8208;presentation to elicit a 55&#8208;fold greater frequency of antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ cytotoxic T&#8208;lymphocyte response than soluble antigen. PEIM@OVA nanovaccine immunization induces potent and durable antitumor immunity to prevent tumor lung metastasis and eliminate established tumors. Moreover, PEIM nanoadjuvant is applicable to deliver autologous tumor antigen and synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade therapy for prevention of postoperative tumor recurrence and distant metastasis in B16&#8208;OVA melanoma and MC38 colorectal tumor models. The acid&#8208;ionizable iron nanoadjuvant offers a generalizable and readily translatable strategy to augment STING cascade activation and antigen cross&#8208;presentation for personalized cancer vaccination immunotherapy.

Moreover, PEIM nanoadjuvant is applicable to deliver autologous tumor antigen and synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade therapy for prevention of postoperative tumor recurrence and distant metastasis in B16-OVA melanoma and MC38 colorectal tumor models. The acid-ionizable iron nanoadjuvant offers a generalizable and readily translatable strategy to augment STING cascade activation and antigen cross-presentation for personalized cancer vaccination immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Pseudocapacitor Diode Based on Ion&#8208;Selective Surface Redox Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pseudocapacitor diode is proposed for the first time, which is constructed by the ion&#8208;selective surface redox mechanism of spinel ZnCo2O4 in aqueous electrolyte KOH, thus successfully integrating the function of blocking the unidirectional current response of a diode into an aqueous pseudocapacitor with fast ion conduction capability.








Abstract
Supercapacitor diode (CAPode) is a novel device that integrates ion diode functionality into a conventional electrical double&#8208;layer capacitor and is expected to have great applications in emerging fields such as signal propagation, microcircuit rectification, logic operations, and neuromorphology. Here, a brand new pseudocapacitor diode is reported that has both high charge storage (50.2&#160;C&#160;g&#8722;1 at 20&#160;mV&#160;s&#8722;1) and high rectification (the rectification ratio of 0.79 at 200&#160;mV&#160;s&#8722;1) properties, which is realized by the ion&#8208;selective surface redox reaction of spinel ZnCo2O4 in aqueous alkaline electrolyte. Furthermore, an application of the integrated device is demonstrated in the logic gate of circuit system to realize the logic operations of &#8220;AND&#8221; and &#8220;OR&#8221;. This work not only expands the types of CAPodes, but also provides a train of thought for constructing high&#8208;performance capacitive ionic diodes.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed Proton Pseudocapacitor with Ultra&#8208;High Mass Loading and Areal Energy Density for Fast Energy Storage at Low Temperature</title>

Abstract
The sluggish ionic transport in thick electrodes and freezing electrolytes has limited electrochemical energy storage devices in lots of harsh environments for practical applications. Here, a 3D&#8208;printed proton pseudocapacitor based on high&#8208;mass loading 3D&#8208;printed WO3 anodes, Prussian blue analogue cathodes, and anti&#8208;freezing electrolytes is developed, which can achieve state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrochemical performance at low temperature. Benefiting from the cross&#8208;scale 3D electrode structure using a 3D printing direct ink writing technique, the 3D&#8208;printed cathode realizes an ultrahigh areal capacitance of 7.39 F cm&#8722;2 at a high areal mass loading of 23.51 mg cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the 3D&#8208;printed pseudocapacitor delivers an areal capacitance of 3.44 F cm&#8211;2 and excellent areal energy density (1.08 mWh cm&#8211;2). Owing to the fast ion kinetics in 3D electrodes and the high ionic conductivity of hybrid electrolyte, the 3D&#8208;printed supercapacitor delivers 61.04% of the room&#8208;temperature capacitance even at &#8722;60&#176;C. This work provides an effective strategy for the practical applications of energy storage devices with complex physical structure at extreme temperatures.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Ni&#8208;Cu Catalysts for pH&#8208;Universal CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
CO2 electroreduction is of great significance to reduce CO2 emissions and complete the carbon cycle. However, the unavoidable carbonate formation and low CO2 utilization efficiency in neutral or alkaline electrolytes hinder its application at commercial scale. The development of CO2 reduction under acidic conditions provides a promising strategy, but the inhibition of hydrogen evolution reaction is difficult. Herein, we report the first work to design in a Ni&#8208;Cu dual&#8208;atom catalyst supported on the hollow nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon for pH&#8208;universal CO2 electroreduction to CO. The catalyst showed high CO Faradaic efficiency of &#8764;99% in acidic, neutral and alkaline electrolytes, and the partial current densities of CO reach 190 &#177; 11 mAcm&#8722;2, 225 &#177; 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 489 &#177; 14&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. In particular, the CO2 utilization efficiency under acidic conditions reaches 64.3%, which is twice higher than that of alkaline conditions. Detailed study indicates the existence of electronic interaction between Ni and Cu atoms. The Cu atoms pushes the Ni d band center further towards the Fermi level, and thereby accelerating the formation of *COOH. In addition, operando characterizations and density functional theory calculation were used to elucidate the possible reaction mechanism of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO under acidic and alkaline electrolytes.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Mott Insulator&#8208;to&#8208;Metal Phase Transition in Ultrathin Intermediate&#8208;Spin Ferromagnetic Perovskite Ruthenates</title>

Abstract
Light control of emergent quantum phenomena is a widely used external stimulus for quantum materials. Generally, perovskite strontium ruthenate SrRuO3 has an itinerant ferromagnetism with a low&#8208;spin state. However, the phase of intermediate&#8208;spin (IS) ferromagnetic metallic state has never been seen. Here, by means of ultraviolet light irradiation, we show the photocarrier doping induced Mott insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal phase transition in a few atomic layers of perovskite IS ferromagnetic SrRuO3&#8208;&#948;. This new metastable IS metallic phase can be reversibly regulated due to the convenient photocharge transfer from SrTiO3 substrates to SrRuO3&#8208;&#948; ultrathin films. Our dynamical mean&#8208;field theory calculations further verify such photoinduced electronic phase transformation owing to oxygen vacancies and orbital reconstruction. The optical manipulation of charge transfer finesse is an alternative pathway towards discovering novel metastable phases in strongly correlated systems and facilitates the potential light&#8208;controlled device applications in optoelectronics and spintronics.

         <title>Pollen&#8208;Inspired Shell&#8208;Core Aerosol Particles Capable of Brownian Motion for Pulmonary Vascularization</title>

Abstract
Nebulization is the most widely used respiratory delivery technique with non&#8208;invasive properties. However, nebulized drugs often fail to function due to the excretion and immune clearance of the respiratory system. Here, inspired by pollen in nature, novel shell&#8208;core aerosol particles (APs) capable of Brownian Motion were constructed for respiratory delivery. Drugs&#8208;loaded poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) nanoparticles were prepared by emulsification to form the inner core, and the membranes of macrophages were extracted to form the outer shell. The optimized size and the shell&#8208;core structure endowed APs with Brownian Motion and atomization stability, thus enabling the APs to reach the bronchi and alveoli deeply for effective deposition. The camouflage of macrophage membranes equipped the APs with immune evasion. In vitro experiments proved that deferoxamine (DFO) loaded APs (DFO@APs) could promote the angiogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. A hyperoxia&#8208;induced bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) model was constructed to validate the efficiency of DFO@APs. In BPD mice, DFO@APs could release DFO in the alveolar interstitium, thus promoting the reconstruction of microvasculature, ultimately inducing lung development for treating BPD. In conclusion, this study developed &#8220;pollen&#8221;&#8208;inspired shell&#8208;core aerosol particles capable of Brownian Motion, which provides a novel idea and theoretical basis for respiratory administration.

         <title>Rapid Identification and Monitoring of Multiple Bacterial Infections Using Printed Nanoarrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fast and accurate detection of microbial cells in clinical samples is highly valuable but remains a challenge. Here, a simple, culture&#8208;free diagnostic system is developed for direct detection of pathogenic bacteria in water, urine and serum samples using an optical colorimetric biosensor. It consists of printed nanoarrays chemically conjugated with specific antibodies that exhibits distinct color changes after capturing target pathogens. By utilizing the internal capillarity inside an evaporating droplet, target preconcentration is achieved within a few minutes to enable rapid identification and more efficient detection of bacterial pathogens. More importantly, the scattering signals of bacteria can be significantly amplified by the nanoarrays due to strong near&#8208;field localization, which supports a visualizable analysis of the growth, reproduction and cell activity of bacteria at the single&#8208;cell level. Finally, in addition to high selectivity, this nanoarray&#8208;based biosensor is also capable of accurate quantification and continuous monitoring of bacterial load on food over a broad linear range, with a detection limit of 10 CFU mL&#8722;1. This work provides an accessible and user&#8208;friendly tool for point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing of pathogens in many clinical and environmental applications, and possibly enables a breakthrough in early prevention and treatment.

         <title>Achieving Fast Charge Separation by Ferroelectric Ultrasonic Interfacial Engineering for Rapid Sonotherapy of Bacteria&#8208;Infected Osteomyelitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Bacteria&#8208;infected osteomyelitis is life&#8208;threatening without effective therapeutic methods clinically. Here we report a rapid and effective therapeutic strategy to treat osteomyelitis through ferroelectric polarization interfacial engineering of BiFeO3/MXene (Ti3C2) triggered by ultrasound (US). Under US, the ferroelectric polarization induces the formation of piezoelectric field. US cavitation effect&#8208;induced sonoluminescence stimulates BiFeO3/Ti3C2 to produce photogenerated carriers. With synergistic action of polarization electric field and Schottky junction, BiFeO3/Ti3C2 accelerates the separation of electrons and holes and simultaneously inhibits the backflow of electrons, thus improving the utilization of polarized charges and photogenerated charges and consequently enhancing the yield of reactive oxygen species under US. As a result, 99.87 &#177; 0.05% of Staphylococcus aureus are efficiently killed in 20&#160;min with the assistance of ultrasonic heating. We propose the theory of ferroelectric ultrasonic interfacial engineering, which brings new insight for developing ferroelectric ultrasonic responsive materials used for the diagnosis and therapy of deep tissue infection and other acoustoelectric devices.

         <title>Revisiting Lithium&#8208; and Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage in Hard Carbon Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The galvanostatic lithiation/sodiation voltage profiles of hard carbon anodes are simple, with a sloping drop followed by plateau. However, a precise understanding of the corresponding redox sites and storage mechanisms is still elusive, which hinders further development in commercial applications. In this study, a comprehensive comparison of the lithium&#8208; and sodium&#8208;ion storage behaviors of hard carbon is conducted, yielding the following key findings: 1) the sloping voltage section is presented by the lithium&#8208;ion intercalation in the graphitic lattices of hard carbons, whereas it mainly arises from the chemisorption of sodium&#8208;ions on their inner surfaces constituting closed pores, even if the graphitic lattices are unoccupied; 2) the redox sites for the plateau capacities are the same as those for the closed pores regardless of the alkali ions; 3) the sodiation plateau capacities are mostly determined by the volume of the available closed pore, whereas the lithiation plateau capacities are primarily affected by the intercalation propensity; and 4) the intercalation preference and the plateau capacity have an inverse correlation. These findings from extensive characterizations and theoretical investigations provide a relatively clear elucidation of the electrochemical footprint of hard carbon anodes in relation to the redox mechanisms and storage sites for lithium and sodium ions, thereby providing a more rational design strategy for constructing better hard carbon anodes.

         <title>Cooperative Electronic Structure Modulator of Fe Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalyst for High Energy and Long Cycle Li&#8211;S Pouch Cell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of electron exchangeable binding sites comprising thiophene S and oxidized S, adjacent to Fe single atom electrocatalysts, improves Li2S redox kinetics by modulating d&#8208;orbital level of Fe single atom via electron exchange. These specially designed electrocatalysts enable realization of a 1 A h level Li&#8211;S pouch cell with high gravimetric energy density and long cycle stability.








Abstract
High&#8208;energy and long cycle lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) pouch cells are limited by the insufficient capacities and stabilities of their cathodes under practical electrolyte/sulfur (E/S), electrolyte/capacity (E/C), and negative/positive (N/P) ratios. Herein, an advanced cathode comprising highly active Fe single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is reported to form 320.2&#160;W h kg&#8722;1 multistacked Li&#8211;S pouch cells with total capacity of &#8776;1 A h level, satisfying low E/S (3.0), E/C (2.8), and N/P (2.3) ratios and high sulfur loadings (8.4&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). The high&#8208;activity Fe SAC is designed by manipulating its local environments using electron&#8208;exchangeable binding (EEB) sites. Introducing EEB sites comprising two different types of S species, namely, thiophene&#8208;like&#8208;S (&#8211;S) and oxidized&#8208;S (&#8211;SO2), adjacent to Fe SACs promotes the kinetics of the Li2S redox reaction by providing additional binding sites and modulating the Fe d&#8208;orbital levels via electron exchange with Fe. The &#8211;S donates the electrons to the Fe SACs, whereas &#8211;SO2 withdraws electrons from the Fe SACs. Thus, the Fe d&#8208;orbital energy level can be modulated by the different &#8211;SO2/&#8211;S ratios of the EEB site, controlling the electron donating/withdrawing characteristics. This desirable electrocatalysis is maximized by the intimate contact of the Fe SACs with the S species, which are confined together in porous carbon.

         <title>A Flexible, High&#8208;Voltage (&gt;100&#160;V) Generating Device Based on Zebra&#8208;Like Asymmetrical Photovoltaic Cascade</title>

         <dc:description>
Gold/aluminum micro&#8208;strips repeat along a specific direction and periodically form overlaps and gaps in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail manner like the patterns of a zebra. After compounding with semiconducting supramolecular nanowires, an output voltage of 140&#160;V can be achieved on a flexible substrate upon illumination.








Abstract
The mutual conversion between light and electricity lies at the heart of optoelectronic and photonic applications. Maximization of the photoelectric conversion is a long&#8208;term goal that can be pursued via the fabrication of devices with ad&#8208;hoc architectures. In this framework, it is of utter importance to harvest and transform light irradiation into high electric potential in&#160;specific area for driving functional dielectrics that respond to pure electric field. Here, a nano&#8208;fabrication technology has been devised featuring double self&#8208;alignment that is applied to construct zebra&#8208;like asymmetric heterojunction arrays. Such nanostructured composite, which covers a surface area of 5&#160;&#215;&#160;4&#160;mm2 and contains 500 periodic repeating units, is capable of photo generating voltages as high as 140&#160;V on a flexible substrate. This approach represents a leap over the traditional functionalization process based on simply embedding materials into devices by demonstrating the disruptive potential of integrating oriented nanoscale device components into meta&#8208;material.

         <title>Realizing Highly Efficient Sonodynamic Bactericidal Capability through the Phonon&#8211;Electron Coupling Effect Using Two&#8208;Dimensional Catalytic Planar Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D catalytic planar defects have been rationally designed and engineered for reversing the ultrasonic silence of Ti3C2, dramatically realizing the highly efficient sonodynamic bactericidal therapy. It is unveiled that the electron's origin, electron transfer, and the visible O2&#160;activation pathway triggered by ultrasound are attributed to the phonon&#8211;electron coupling effect.








Abstract
Conferring catalytic defects in sonosensitizers is of paramount importance in reinforcing sonodynamic therapy. However, the formation of such 0D defects is governed by the Schottky defect principle. Herein, 2D catalytic planar defects are designed within Ti3C2&#160;sheets to address this challenge. These specific planar slip dislocations with abundant Ti3+ species (Ti3C2&#8208;SD(Ti3+)) can yield surface&#8208;bound O due to the effective activation of O2, thus resulting in a substantial amount of 1O2&#160;generation and the 99.72%&#160;&#177;&#160;0.03% bactericidal capability subject to ultrasound (US) stimulation. It is discovered that the 2D catalytic planar defects can intervene in electron transfer through the phonon drag effect&#8212;a coupling effect between surface electrons and US&#8208;triggered phonons&#8212;that simultaneously contributes to a dramatic decrease in O2&#160;activation energy from 1.65&#160;to 0.06&#160;eV. This design has achieved a qualitative leap in which the US catalytic site has transformed from 0D to 2D. Moreover, it is revealed that the electron origin, electron transfer, and visible O2&#160;activation pathway triggered by US can be attributed to the phonon&#8211;electron coupling effect. After coating with neutrophil membrane (NM) proteins, the NM&#8208;Ti3C2&#8208;SD(Ti3+) sheets further demonstrate a 6&#8208;log10&#160;reduction in methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus burden in the infected bony tissue.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Nanocrystalline Structures from Freestanding Oxide Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scientific exploration of nanomaterials has led to massive growth in understanding and applications of quantum materials at the nanoscale. A route for fabrication of nanocrystalline oxide structures of exceptional quality utilizing self&#8208;assembly of freestanding membranes transferred on appropriate substrates is presented. The microstructure of the nanocrystals exhibits exceptional quality, characterized by a pristine crystal structure and uniform stoichiometry after self&#8208;assembly.








Abstract
The exploration of crystalline nanostructures enhances the understanding of quantum phenomena occurring in spatially confined quantum matter and may lead to functional materials with unforeseen applications. A novel route to fabricating nanocrystalline oxide structures of exceptional quality is presented. This is achieved by utilizing a self&#8208;assembly process of ultrathin membranes composed of the desired oxide. The thermally induced self&#8208;assembly of nanocrystalline structures is driven by dewetting the oxide membranes once they are lifted off and transferred onto sapphire surfaces. In three successive steps, the process provides nanovoids, nanowires, and nanocrystals. Regardless of substrate orientation, the nanostructures are highly anisotropic in shape due to material retraction favoring low&#8208;index crystalline lattice directions of the membranes. The orientation of the nanostructures is provided precisely by the crystal lattice of the transferred membrane. The microstructure of the nanocrystals exhibits exceptional quality, characterized by a pristine crystal structure and uniform stoichiometry, both maintained all the way down to the well&#8208;developed crystalline facets. The demonstrated self&#8208;assembly process holds the potential to improve the understanding of surface diffusion phenomena at the interface of materials, which is important for advancing epitaxial growth technology and paves the way to fabricating crystalline nanostructures by the transfer and self&#8208;assembly of membranes.

         <title>Self&#8208;Sustained Programmable Hygroelectronic Interfaces for Humidity&#8208;Regulated Hierarchical Information Encryption and Display</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emerging moisture&#8208;driven energy generation (MEG) technology opens up new possibilities for humidity&#8208;responsive materials, devices, and interdisciplinary opportunities in fields like information security. Here, hygroelectronic information interfaces, which are based on an MEG structure with a hygroionic energy&#8208;conversion route, are put forward for humidity&#8208;regulated hierarchical information encryption and display.








Abstract
The emerging moisture&#8208;driven energy generation (MEG) technology opens up new possibilities for humidity&#8208;responsive materials, devices, and interdisciplinary opportunities in fields like information security. However, such potential remains untapped. Here, an original MEG structure with a hygroionic energy&#8208;conversion route by selective coating of ionic hygroscopic hydrogels on a carbon black surface is reported. The hygroionic route features a process in which the scavenged energy is stored in the electrical double layers formed at the interfaces between the ionic hydrogel and the carbon nanoparticles. The resultant electrical field developed across the hydrogel&#8208;coated wet carbon and the rest of the dry carbon area is thus durably lasted. Based on this unique structure, hygroelectronic information interfaces (HEII) for humidity&#8208;regulated information encryption and display&#160;are put forward by devising hydrogel patterns on a carbon platform. Further by tuning the hygroscopicity of the ionic hydrogels and incorporating encoding methods (e.g., Morse code), it is demonstrated that the HEII platform is programmable to carry different information in certain humidity ranges. Unlike those conventional anti&#8208;counterfeiting methods that optically reveal the hidden information once the required stimulus is provided, the new HEII serves as a hierarchical solution for high&#8208;security encryption and display.

         <title>Polymer Solar Cells with Active Layer Thickness Compatible with Scalable Fabrication Processes: A Meta&#8208;Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Active layers with high thickness are needed for the manufacture of organic solar devices using roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll&#8208;compatible deposition techniques. On the other hand, high thickness values disfavor charge transport and, consequently, efficiency. Identifying the best compromise between thin and thick layers is essential to bring the organic photovoltaics technology to the market.








Abstract
Organic photovoltaics (OPV) has been considered for a long time a promising emerging solar technology. Currently, however, market shares of OPV are practically non&#8208;existent. A detailed meta&#8208;analysis of the literature published until mid&#8208;2021 is presented, focusing on one of the remaining issues that need to be addressed to translate the recent remarkable progress, obtained in devices&#8217; performance at lab&#8208;scale level, into the requirements able to boost the manufacturing&#8208;scale production. Namely, the active layer's thickness is referred to, which, together with device efficiency and stability, represents one of the biggest challenges of this technological research field. Papers describing solar cells containing non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA) binary and ternary blends, as well as NFA plus fullerene acceptor (FA) ternary blends are reviewed. The common ground of all analyzed devices is their high&#8208;thickness active layers, compatible with large&#8208;area deposition techniques. By defining a new figure of merit to discuss the OPV thickness (thickness tolerance, TT), it is found that this parameter is not affected by the chemical family's nature of the active blend components. On the other hand, the analysis suggests that there are promising strategies to improve the TT, which are discussed in the conclusion section.

         <title>HACS: Helical Auxetic Yarn Capacitive Strain Sensors with Sensitivity Beyond the Theoretical Limit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Capacitive strain sensors are theoretically limited in their sensitivity. In this work, stretchable and flexible strain sensors are fabricated using a helical auxetic yarn structure providing access to auxetic character in the fiber form. The helical auxetic capacitive sensors (HACS) are able to access sensitivity beyond the theoretical limit, determined to be because of an engulfment phenomenon that occurs as a result of the materials employed and the auxetic character.








Abstract
The development of flexible strain sensors over the past decade has focused on accessing high strain percentages and high sensitivity (i.e., gauge factors). Strain sensors that employ capacitance as the electrical signal to correlate to strain are typically restricted in sensitivity because of the Poisson effect. By employing auxetic structures, the limits of sensitivity for capacitive sensors have been exceeded, which has improved the competitiveness of this modality of sensing. In this work, the first employment of helical auxetic yarns as capacitive sensors is presented. It is found that the response of the helical auxetic yarn capacitive sensors (termed as HACS) is dependent on the two main fabrication variables&#8212;the ratio of diameters and the helical wrapping length. Depending on these variables, sensors that respond to strain with increasing or decreasing capacitance values can be obtained. A greater auxetic character results in larger sensitivities accessible at smaller strains&#8212;a characteristic that is not commonly found when accessing high gauge factors. In addition, the highest sensitivity for auxetic capacitive sensors reported thus far is obtained. A mechanism of sensor response that explains both the variable capacitance response and the high gauge factors obtained experimentally is proposed.

In this work, the first employment of helical auxetic yarns as capacitive sensors is presented. It is found that the response of the helical auxetic yarn capacitive sensors (termed as HACS) is dependent on the two main fabrication variables&#8212;the ratio of diameters and the helical wrapping length. Depending on these variables, sensors that respond to strain with increasing or decreasing capacitance values can be obtained. A greater auxetic character results in larger sensitivities accessible at smaller strains&#8212;a characteristic that is not commonly found when accessing high gauge factors. In addition, the highest sensitivity for auxetic capacitive sensors reported thus far is obtained. A mechanism of sensor response that explains both the variable capacitance response and the high gauge factors obtained experimentally is proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Organohydrogel Artificial Muscle with Compartmentalized Anisotropic Actuation Under Microdomain Confinement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organohydrogel actuator achieving the combination of high speed, high actuation strength, and large material size is proposed. The water is confined in hydrophobic microdomains in organohydrogel, thus realizing a compartmentalization actuation mode similar to muscle. This strategy can break through the limitations that originated from the traditional solvent diffusion actuation mechanism, inspiring gel actuator design.








Abstract
Current hydrogel actuators mostly suffer from weak actuation strength and low responsive speed owing to their solvent diffusion&#8208;induced volume change mechanism. Here a skeletal muscle&#8208;inspired organohydrogel actuator is reported in which solvents are confined in hydrophobic microdomains. Organohydrogel actuator is driven by compartmentalized directional network deformation instead of volume change, avoiding the limitations that originate from solvent diffusion. Organohydrogel actuator has an actuation frequency of 0.11&#160;Hz, 110 times that of traditional solvent diffusion&#8208;driven hydrogel actuators (&lt;10&#8722;3&#160;Hz), and can lift more than 85 times their own weight. This design achieves the combination of high responsive speed, high actuation strength, and large material size, proposing a strategy to fabricate hydrogel actuators comparable with skeletal muscle performance.

         <title>Microscale Combinatorial Libraries for the Discovery of High&#8208;Entropy Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microscale combinatorial libraries are introduced as a new method for exploration of polyelemental material systems. Composition gradients of quinary material systems are produced and characterized for crystal properties and electrocatalytic activity. The small dimensions of microscale combinatorial libraries enable efficient screening of thousands of compositions. Highly active electrocatalysts are identified in the systems Ru&#8211;Rh&#8211;Pd&#8211;Ir&#8211;Pt and Co&#8211;Ni&#8211;Mo&#8211;Pd&#8211;Pt.








Abstract
Polyelemental material systems, specifically high&#8208;entropy alloys, promise unprecedented properties. Due to almost unlimited combinatorial possibilities, their exploration and exploitation is hard. This challenge is addressed by co&#8208;sputtering combined with shadow masking to produce a multitude of microscale combinatorial libraries in one deposition process. These thin&#8208;film composition spreads on the microscale cover unprecedented compositional ranges of high&#8208;entropy alloy systems and enable high&#8208;throughput characterization of thousands of compositions for electrocatalytic energy conversion reactions using nanoscale scanning electrochemical cell microscopy. The exemplary exploration of the composition space of two high&#8208;entropy alloy systems provides electrocatalytic activity maps for hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution as well as oxygen reduction reactions. Activity optima in the system Ru&#8211;Rh&#8211;Pd&#8211;Ir&#8211;Pt are identified, and active noble&#8208;metal lean compositions in the system Co&#8211;Ni&#8211;Mo&#8211;Pd&#8211;Pt are discovered. This illustrates that the proposed microlibraries are a holistic discovery platform to master the multidimensionality challenge of polyelemental systems.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Cation Composition Engineering of Hybrid Cs1&#8722;xFAxPbBr3 Nanocrystals for Self&#8208;Healing Electronics Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel post&#8208;synthesis cesium/formamidinium (Cs/FA) mixed&#8208;cation perovskite nanocrystals possess high structural and optoelectronic properties for integration in self&#8208;healing polymer composites. Entropic&#8208;driven self&#8208;healing not only enhances white backlight display performance, but also sustains the working performance of a shattered&#8211;repaired glass substrate laser, thereby representing potentially major advances in optoelectronics and photonics applications.








Abstract
Mixed&#8208;cation hybrid perovskite nanocrystal (HPNC) with high crystallinity, color purity, and tunable optical bandgap offers a practical pathway toward next&#8208;generation&#160;displays. Herein, a two&#8208;step modified hot&#8208;injection combined with cation compositional engineering and surface treatment to synthesize high&#8208;purity cesium/formamidinium lead bromide HPNCs(Cs1&#8208;xFAxPbBr3) is presented. The optimized Cs0.5FA0.5PbBr3 light&#8208;emitting devices (LEDs) exhibit uniform luminescence of 3500&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and a prominent current efficiency of 21.5&#160;cd A&#8722;1. As a proof of concept, a self&#8208;healing polymer (SHP) integrated with white LED backlight and laser prototypes exhibited 4 h autonomous self&#8208;healing through the synergistic effect of weak reversible imine bonds and stronger H&#8208;bonds. First, the SHP&#8208;HPNCs&#8208;initial and SHP&#8208;HPNCs&#8208;cut possess high long&#8208;term stability and dramatically suppressed lead leakage as low as 0.6&#160;ppm along with a low leakage rate of 1.11 &#215; 10&#8722;5 cm2 and 3.36 &#215; 10&#8722;5 cm2 even over 6 months in water. Second, the Cs0.5FA0.5PbBr3 HPNCs and SHP&#8208;induced shattered&#8211;repaired perovskite glass substrate show the lowest lasing threshold values of 1.24 and 8.58 &#181;J cm&#8722;2, respectively. This work provides an integrative and in&#8208;depth approach to exploiting SHP with intrinsic and entropic self&#8208;healing capabilities combined with HPNCs to develop robust and reliable soft&#8208;electronic backlight and laser applications.

         <title>Control of Molecular Orbital Ordering Using a van der Waals Monolayer Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling and tuning the orbital ordering in a single molecule using a monolayer ferroelectric substrate is realized. This is achieved by adsorbing transition metal phthalocyanine (TMPc) molecules on a ferroelectric monolayer SnTe. The orbital order is probed using low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments, and it is demonstrated that it can be controllably changed by switching the polarization direction of the underlying ferroelectric monolayer.








Abstract
2D ferroelectric materials provide a promising platform for the electrical control of quantum states. In particular, due to their 2D nature, they are suitable for influencing the quantum states of deposited molecules via the proximity effect. Here, electrically controllable molecular states in phthalocyanine molecules adsorbed on monolayer ferroelectric material SnTe are reported. The strain and ferroelectric order in SnTe are found to create a transition between two distinct orbital orders in the adsorbed phthalocyanine molecules. By controlling the polarization of the ferroelectric domain using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), it is successfully demonstrated that orbital order can be manipulated electrically. The results show how ferroelastic coupling in 2D systems allows for control of molecular states, providing a starting point for ferroelectrically switchable molecular orbital ordering and ultimately, electrical control of molecular&#160;magnetism.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Reconstruction of Conductive Filaments in HfOx&#8208;Based Memristor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conductive filaments (CFs) with different morphologies after forming, set, and reset operations are clearly revealed in HfOx&#8208;based memristors by the 3D reconstruction of c&#8208;AFM technique. Multiple conductive filaments are successfully observed in the devices with three different resistive states. The rupture location of CFs after reset is also observed clearly.








Abstract
HfOx&#8208;based memristor has been studied extensively as one of the most promising memories for the excellent nonvolatile data storage and computing&#8208;in&#8208;memory capabilities. However, the resistive switching mechanism, relying on the formation and rupture of conductive filaments (CFs) during device operations, is still under debate. In this work, the CFs with different morphologies after different operations&#8212;forming, set, and reset&#8212;are clearly revealed for the first time by 3D reconstruction of conductive atomic force microscopy (c&#8208;AFM) images. Intriguingly, multiple CFs are successfully observed in HfOx&#8208;based memristor devices with three different resistive states. CFs after forming, set, and reset exhibit the typical morphologies of hourglass, inverted&#8208;cone, and short&#8208;cone, respectively. The rupture location of CFs after the reset operation is also observed clearly. These findings reveal the microscopic behaviors underlying the resistive switching, which could pave the road to design and optimize oxide&#8208;based memristors for both memory and computing applications.

&lt;p&gt;Conductive filaments (CFs) with different morphologies after forming, set, and reset operations are clearly revealed in HfO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-based memristors by the 3D reconstruction of c-AFM technique. Multiple conductive filaments are successfully observed in the devices with three different resistive states. The rupture location of CFs after reset is also observed clearly.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HfO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-based memristor has been studied extensively as one of the most promising memories for the excellent nonvolatile data storage and computing-in-memory capabilities. However, the resistive switching mechanism, relying on the formation and rupture of conductive filaments (CFs) during device operations, is still under debate. In this work, the CFs with different morphologies after different operations&#8212;forming, set, and reset&#8212;are clearly revealed for the first time by 3D reconstruction of conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) images. Intriguingly, multiple CFs are successfully observed in HfO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-based memristor devices with three different resistive states. CFs after forming, set, and reset exhibit the typical morphologies of hourglass, inverted-cone, and short-cone, respectively. The rupture location of CFs after the reset operation is also observed clearly. These findings reveal the microscopic behaviors underlying the resistive switching, which could pave the road to design and optimize oxide-based memristors for both memory and computing applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A New Class of Cluster&#8211;Matrix Nanocomposite Made of Fully Miscible Components</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The prospect for creating highly metastable nanocomposite materials made from fully miscible alloy systems, like Ni&#8211;Cu, is opened. The cluster ion beam deposition technique allows stabilization of 2000&#8208;atom Ni&#8208;clusters in a Cu&#8208;matrix with varying macroscopic concentration. Consequently, unique magnetic and magnetotransport properties are evident as a function of cluster concentration and enthalpy&#8208;driven cluster dissolution.








Abstract
Nanocomposite materials, consisting of two or more phases, at least one of which has a nanoscale dimension, play a distinctive role in materials science because of the multiple possibilities for tailoring their structural properties and, consequently, their functionalities. In addition to the challenges of controlling the size, size distribution, and volume fraction of nanometer phases, thermodynamic stability conditions limit the choice of constituent materials. This study goes beyond this limitation by showing the possibility of achieving nanocomposites from a bimetallic system, which exhibits complete miscibility under equilibrium conditions. A series of nanocomposite samples with different compositions are synthesized by the co&#8208;deposition of 2000&#8208;atom Ni&#8208;clusters and a flux of Cu&#8208;atoms using a novel cluster ion beam deposition system. The retention of the metastable nanostructure is ascertained from atom probe tomography (APT), magnetometry, and magnetotransport studies. APT confirms the presence of nanoscale regions with &#8776;100 at% Ni. Magnetometry and magnetotransport studies reveal superparamagnetic behavior and magnetoresistance stemming from the single&#8208;domain ferromagnetic Ni&#8208;clusters embedded in the Cu&#8208;matrix. Essentially, the magnetic properties of the nanocomposites can be tailored by the precise control of the Ni concentration. The initial results offer a promising direction for future research on nanocomposites consisting of fully miscible elements.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Powered Dielectrophoretic Microparticle Manipulation Platform Based on a Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;powered DEP microparticle manipulation platform based on a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is proposed, which performs high&#8208;efficiency cell separation. This work provides an ideal scheme for improving the portability of microfluidic chips and is beneficial to the commercialization of lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip systems.








Abstract
Lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip systems aim to integrate laboratory operations on a miniaturized device with broad application prospects in the field of point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing. However, bulky peripheral power resources, such as high&#8208;voltage supplies, function generators, and amplifiers, hamper the commercialization of the system. In this work, a portable, self&#8208;powered microparticle manipulation platform based on triboelectrically driven dielectrophoresis (DEP) is reported. A rotary freestanding triboelectric nanogenerator (RF&#8208;TENG) and rectifier/filter circuit supply a high&#8208;voltage direct&#8208;current signal to form a non&#8208;uniform electric field within the microchannel, realizing controllable actuation of the microparticles through DEP. The operating mechanism of this platform and the control performance of the moving particles are systematically studied and analyzed. Randomly distributed particles converge in a row after passing through the serpentine channel and various particles are separated owing to the different DEP forces. Ultimately, the high&#8208;efficiency separation of live and dead yeast cells is achieved using this platform. RF&#8208;TENG as the power source for lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip exhibits better safety and portability than traditional high&#8208;voltage power sources. This study presents a promising solution for the commercialization of lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip.

         <dc:description>
An &#8220;enzyme&#8208;like&#8221; construction strategy for ultralow humidity&#8208;sensitive paper (UHSP) is proposed, which activates hydrochromic molecular switching by constructing a spatially&#8208;fixed polyhydroxyl microenvironment. As a result, recyclable naked eye recognition of 0.01&#8211;100&#160;ppm humidity is achieved first. This UHSP provides a more economical, environmental friendly and convenient choice for ultralow humidity monitoring required by high&#8208;tech manufacturing such as chips, solar cells, etc.








Abstract
The detection and monitoring of ultralow humidity (&lt;100&#160;ppm) are critical in many important industries, such as high&#8208;tech manufacturing, scientific research, and aerospace. However, the development of ppm level humidity sensors with portability, low cost, and ease of regeneration remains a significant challenge. Herein, an innovative &#8220;enzyme&#8208;like&#8221; construction strategy is proposed to address this problem by employing suitable molecular&#8208;level humidity&#8208;sensitive units and chemically constructing a multilevel spatial synergistic sensitization microenvironment around it. The as&#8208;prepared ultralow humidity&#8208;sensitive paper (UHSP) achieved a naked eye recognition humidity of 0.01&#8211;100&#160;ppm. UHSP not only is simple to prepare, handy and low&#8208;cost, but can also be simply and efficiently regenerated as well as recycled many times by skillfully utilizing the &#8220;unconventional sublimation&#8221; and &#8220;lime slaked&#8221; of calcium oxide. The molecular reaction mechanisms involved in the humidity response and regeneration of UHSP have been demonstrated in detail. UHSP can provide a promising new method for ultralow humidity detection in the form of portable kits or sirens. The demonstrated &#8220;enzyme&#8208;like&#8221; construction strategy can bring unlimited ideas and implications to the design and development of sensors with tunable response thresholds, particularly high sensitivity.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Change Perovskite Microlaser with Tunable Polarization Vortex</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A subwavelength&#8208;thin perovskite metasurface supporting multiple bound states in the continuum is used to realize a tunable polarization&#8208;vortex laser. The structural phase&#8208;change properties of the perovskite induce bistable dynamic switching of the topological charges as a function of temperature.








Abstract
Metasurfaces supporting optical bound states in the continuum (BICs) are emerging as simple and compact optical cavities to realize polarization&#8208;vortex lasers. The winding of the polarization around the singularity defines topological charges which are generally set by the cavity design and cannot be altered without changing geometrical parameters. Here, a subwavelength&#8208;thin phase&#8208;change halide perovskite BIC metasurface functioning as a tunable polarization vortex microlaser is demonstrated. Upon the perovskite structural phase transitions, both its refractive index and gain vary substantially, inducing reversible and bistable switching between distinct polarization vortexes underpinned by opposite topological charges. Dynamic tuning and switching of the resulting vector beams may find use in microscopy imaging, particle trapping and manipulation, and optical data storage.

         <title>Composition&#8208;Controllable Syntheses and Property Modulations from 2D Ferromagnetic Fe5Se8 to Metallic Fe3Se4 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the composition&#8208;controllable syntheses of 2D non&#8208;layered iron selenide nanosheets (25% Fe&#8208;intercalated triclinic Fe5Se8 and 50% Fe&#8208;intercalated monoclinic Fe3Se4), via a robust chemical vapor deposition strategy is presented. Intriguingly, it has been revealed that the 2D Fe5Se8 exhibits intrinsic room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic property, and the ultrathin Fe3Se4 presents a novel metallic feature.








Abstract
Exploring new&#8208;type 2D magnetic materials with high magnetic transition temperature and robust air stability has attracted wide attention for developing innovative spintronic devices. Recently, intercalation of native metal atoms into the van der Waals gaps of 2D layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has been developed to form 2D non&#8208;layered magnetic TMDs, while only succeeded in limited systems (e.g., Cr2S3, Cr5Te8). Herein, composition&#8208;controllable syntheses of 2D non&#8208;layered iron selenide nanosheets (25% Fe&#8208;intercalated triclinic Fe5Se8 and 50% Fe&#8208;intercalated monoclinic Fe3Se4) are firstly reported, via a robust chemical vapor deposition strategy. Specifically, the 2D Fe5Se8 exhibits intrinsic room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic property, which is explained by the change of electron spin states from layered 1T'&#8208;FeSe2 to non&#8208;layered Fe&#8208;intercalated Fe5Se8 based on density functional theory calculations. In contrast, the ultrathin Fe3Se4 presents novel metallic features comparable with that of metallic TMDs. This work hereby sheds light on the composition&#8208;controllable synthesis and fundamental property exploration of 2D self&#8208;intercalation induced novel TMDs compounds, by propelling their application explorations in nanoelectronics and spintronics&#8208;related fields.

         <title>An Effective Sneak&#8208;Path Solution Based on a Transient&#8208;Relaxation Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy in which&#160;the transient relaxation in a type of dynamic selector made from unipolar volatile memristors is harnessed to effectively address&#160;the sneak&#8208;path problem in memristor arrays is demonstrated.








Abstract
An efficient strategy for addressing individual devices is required to unveil the full potential of memristors for high&#8208;density memory and computing applications. Existing strategies using two&#8208;terminal selectors that are preferable for compact integration have trade&#8208;offs in reduced generality or functional window. A strategy that applies to broad memristors and maintains their full&#8208;range functional window is proposed. This strategy uses a type of unipolar switch featuring a transient relaxation or retention as the selector. The unidirectional current flow in the switch suppresses the sneak&#8208;path current, whereas the transient&#8208;relaxation window is exploited for bidirectional programming. A unipolar volatile memristor with ultralow switching voltage (e.g., &lt;100&#160;mV), constructed from a protein nanowire dielectric harvested from Geobacter sulfurreducens, is specifically employed as the example switch to highlight the advantages and scalability in the strategy for array integration.

         <title>Modulating Hydrogen Adsorption via Charge Transfer at the Semiconductor&#8211;Metal Heterointerface&#160;for Highly Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The RhP2/Rh heterointerface induces electron transfer from metallic Rh to semiconductive RhP2, which effectively increases the electron density on the Rh atoms in RhP2 and weakens the hydrogen adsorption on RhP2. The interfacial electron transfer can activate the dual&#8208;site synergistic effect of Rh and P of RhP2, effectively promoting reorganization of interfacial water molecules for faster hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics.








Abstract
Designing and synthesizing highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is important for realizing the hydrogen economy. Tuning the electronic structure of the electrocatalysts is essential to achieve optimal HER activity, and interfacial engineering is an effective strategy to induce electron transfer in a heterostructure interface to optimize HER kinetics. In this study, ultrafine RhP2/Rh nanoparticles are synthesized with a well&#8208;defined semiconductor&#8211;metal heterointerface embedded in N,P co&#8208;doped graphene (RhP2/Rh@NPG) via a one&#8208;step pyrolysis. RhP2/Rh@NPG exhibits outstanding HER performances under all pH conditions. Electrochemical characterization and first principles density functional theory calculations reveal that the RhP2/Rh heterointerface induces electron transfer from metallic Rh to semiconductive RhP2, which increases the electron density on the Rh atoms in RhP2 and weakens the hydrogen adsorption on RhP2, thereby accelerating the HER kinetics. Moreover, the interfacial electron transfer activates the dual&#8208;site synergistic effect of Rh and P of RhP2 in neutral and alkaline environments, thereby promoting reorganization of interfacial water molecules for faster HER kinetics.

         <title>Hybrid Block Copolymer/Perovskite Heterointerfaces for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid block copolymer/perovskite heterointerfaces strategy is developed for the first time by introducing a novel and functional block copolymer PBDB&#8208;T&#8208;b&#8208;PTY6, and consequently, such an architecture enhances light harvesting, promotes charge transfer and prevents moisture invasion, delivering a champion efficiency over 24% together with enhanced stability.








Abstract
Solution processable semiconductors like organics and emerging lead halide perovskites (LHPs) are ideal candidates for photovoltaics combining high performance and flexibility with reduced manufacturing cost. Moreover, the study of hybrid semiconductors would lead to advanced structures and deep understanding that will propel this field even further. Herein, a novel device architecture involving block copolymer/perovskite hybrid bulk heterointerfaces is investigated, such a modification could enhance light absorption, create an energy level cascade, and provides a thin hydrophobic layer, thus enabling enhanced carrier generation, promoting energy transfer and preventing moisture invasion, respectively. The resulting hybrid block copolymer/perovskite solar cell exhibits a champion efficiency of 24.07% for 0.0725&#160;cm2&#8208;sized devices and 21.44% for 1&#160;cm2&#8208;sized devices, respectively, together with enhanced stability, which is among the highest reports of organic/perovskite hybrid devices. More importantly, this approach has been effectively extended to other LHPs with different chemical compositions like MAPbI3 and CsPbI3, which may shed light on the design of highly efficient block copolymer/perovskite hybrid materials and architectures that would overcome current limitations for realistic application exploration.

         <title>Engineering Metal&#8211;Phenolic Networks for Solar Desalination with Directional Salt Crystallization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8722;phenolic network (MPN)&#8208;engineered 3D evaporators are constructed by alternately arranging superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic sponges secured with hydrophilic threads. The MPN coatings endow the sponges with photothermal properties and selective wettability, enabling the efficient, long&#8208;term, and sustained desalination of high&#8208;salinity brine for both indoor and outdoor field operations.








Abstract
Solar desalination is one of the most promising strategies to address the global freshwater shortage crisis. However, the residual salt accumulated on the top surface of solar evaporators severely reduces light absorption and steam evaporation efficiency, thus impeding the further industrialization of this technology. Herein, a metal&#8211;phenolic network (MPN)&#8208;engineered 3D evaporator composed of photothermal superhydrophilic/superhydrophobic sponges and side&#8208;twining hydrophilic threads for efficient desalination with directional salt crystallization and zero liquid discharge is reported.

&lt;p&gt;Metal&#8722;phenolic network (MPN)-engineered 3D evaporators are constructed by alternately arranging superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic sponges secured with hydrophilic threads. The MPN coatings endow the sponges with photothermal properties and selective wettability, enabling the efficient, long-term, and sustained desalination of high-salinity brine for both indoor and outdoor field operations.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solar desalination is one of the most promising strategies to address the global freshwater shortage crisis. However, the residual salt accumulated on the top surface of solar evaporators severely reduces light absorption and steam evaporation efficiency, thus impeding the further industrialization of this technology. Herein, a metal&#8211;phenolic network (MPN)-engineered 3D evaporator composed of photothermal superhydrophilic/superhydrophobic sponges and side-twining hydrophilic threads for efficient desalination with directional salt crystallization and zero liquid discharge is reported. The MPN coatings afford the engineering of alternating photothermal superhydrophilic/superhydrophobic sponges with high heating efficiency and defined vapor escape channels, while the side-twining threads induce site-selective salt crystallization. The 3D evaporator exhibits a high and stable indoor desalination rate (&#8776;2.3&#160;kg&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) of concentrated seawater (20&#160;wt%) under simulated sun irradiation for over 21 days without the need for salt crystallization inhibitors. This direct desalination is also achieved in outdoor field operations with a production rate of clean water up to &#8776;1.82&#160;kg&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; from concentrated seawater (10&#160;wt%). Together with the high affinity and multiple functions of MPNs, this work is expected to facilitate the rational design of solar desalination devices and boost the research translation of MPN materials in broader applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Role of Bicontinuous Structure in Elastomeric Electrolytes for High&#8208;Energy Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>

The structure&#8211;property&#8211;electrochemical performance relationship of the elastomeric electrolyte system is established to demonstrate the importance of balancing Li&#8208;ion transport and mechanical properties for achieving high energy Li metal batteries.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium (Li)&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) are garnering attention as a next&#8208;generation battery technology that can surpass conventional Li&#8208;ion batteries in terms of energy density and operational safety under the condition that the issue of uncontrolled Li dendrite is resolved. In this study, various plastic crystal&#8208;embedded elastomer electrolytes (PCEEs) are investigated with different phase&#8208;separated structures, prepared by systematically adjusting the volume ratio of the phases, to elucidate the structure&#8208;property&#8208;electrochemical performance relationship of the PCEE in the LMBs. At an optimal volume ratio of elastomer phase to plastic&#8208;crystal phase (i.e., 1:1), bicontinuous&#8208;structured PCEE, consisting of efficient ion&#8208;conducting, plastic&#8208;crystal pathways with long&#8208;range connectivity within a crosslinked elastomer matrix, exhibits exceptionally high ionic conductivity (&#8776;10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1) at 20 &#176;C and excellent mechanical resilience (elongation at break &#8776; 300%). A full cell featuring this optimized PCEE, a 35&#160;&#181;m thick Li anode, and a high loading LiNi0.83Mn0.06Co0.11O2 (NMC&#8208;83) cathode delivers a high energy density of 437&#160;Wh kganode+cathode+electrolyte&#8722;1. The established structure&#8211;property&#8211;electrochemical performance relationship of the PCEE for solid&#8208;state LMBs is expected to inform the development of the elastomeric electrolytes for various electrochemical energy systems.

         <title>Porous Covalent Organic Polymer Coordinated Single Co Site Nanofibers for Efficient Oxygen&#8208;Reduction Cathodes in Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid processable COP&#8208;based material is directly used in fuel cell devices via a pyrolysis&#8208;free strategy. The nanofibers can be facilely organized into a free&#8208;standing large&#8208;area film with a hierarchical porous texture and the full dispersion of the atomic Co active sites. Resultingly, both the power density and durability are significantly improved compared with the traditional conventional spraying methods.








Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;cobalt&#8208;atom electrocatalysts, particularly ones derived from high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis of cobalt&#8208;based zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), have emerged as a new frontier in the design of oxygen reduction cathodes in polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) due to their enhanced durability and smaller Fenton effects related to the degradation of membranes and ionomers compared with emphasized iron&#8208;based electrocatalysts. However, pyrolysis techniques lead to obscure active&#8208;site configurations, undesirably defined porosity and morphology, and fewer exposed active sites. Herein, a highly stable cross&#8208;linked nanofiber electrode is directly prepared by electrospinning using a liquid processability cobalt&#8208;based covalent organic polymer (Co&#8208;COP) obtained via pyrolysis&#8208;free strategy. The resultant fibers can be facilely organized into a free&#8208;standing large&#8208;area film with a uniform hierarchical porous texture and a full dispersion of atomic Co active sites on the catalyst surface. Focused ion beam&#8208;field emission scanning electron microscopy and computational fluid dynamics experiments confirm that the relative diffusion coefficient is enhanced by 3.5 times, which can provide an efficient route both for reactants to enter the active sites, and drain away the produced water efficiently. Resultingly, the peak power density of the integrated Co&#8208;COP nanofiber electrode is remarkably enhanced by 1.72 times along with significantly higher durability compared with conventional spraying methods. Notably, this nanofabrication technique also maintains excellent scalability and uniformity.

         <title>Nanoscale TEM Imaging of Hydrogel Network Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct observation of the nanoscale polymer network of hydrogels is essential in understanding its properties. Herein, for the first time, a novel staining and structure fixation method is developed for transmission electron microscopy&#160;observation to visualize the hydrogel network architecture in its unperturbed conformation. The revealed molecular structures provide important insights for the friction, adhesion, and fracture of hydrogels.








Abstract
In this work, the authors succeed in direct visualization of the network structure of synthetic hydrogels with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) by developing a novel staining and network fixation method. Such a direct visualization is not carried out because sample preparation and obtaining sufficient contrast are challenging for these soft materials. TEM images reveal robust heterogeneous network architectures at mesh size scale and defects at micro&#8208;scale. TEM images also reveal the presence of abundant dangling chains on the surface of the hydrogel network. The real space structural information provides a comprehensive perspective that links bulk properties with a nanoscale network structure, including fracture, adhesion, sliding friction, and lubrication. The presented method has the potential to advance the field.

         <title>Emergent, Non&#8208;Aging, Extendable, and Rechargeable Exchange Bias in 2D Fe3GeTe2 Homostructures Induced by Moderate Pressuring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon moderate pressuring, Fe3GeTe2 as a prototypical layered magnet transits into a ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic coexisting state, and the homostructure with an atomically smooth interface exhibits unprecedented exchange bias (ExB) without gradual aging before collapsing via avalanching. The very existence of the non&#8208;aging nature further allows achieving, striking and technologically significant extendability and rechargeability of the ExB.








Abstract
As a crucial concept in magnetism and spintronics, exchange bias (ExB) measures the asymmetry in the hysteresis loop of a pinned ferromagnet (FM)/antiferromagnet (AFM) interface. Previous studies are mainly focused on FM/AFM heterostructures composed of conventional bulk materials, whose complex interfaces prohibit precise control and full understanding of the phenomenon. Here, the enabling power of 2D magnets is exploited to demonstrate the emergence, non&#8208;aging, extendability, and rechargeability of ExB in van der Waals Fe3GeTe2 homostructures, upon moderate pressuring. The emergence of the ExB is attributed to a local stress&#8208;induced FM&#8208;to&#8208;AFM transition, as validated using first&#8208;principles calculations, and confirmed in magneto&#8208;optical Kerr effect and second harmonic generation measurements. It is also observed that, negligible ExB aging before the training effect suddenly takes place through avalanching, pronounced delay of the avalanche via timed pressure repetition (extendability), ExB recovery in the post&#8208;training sample upon refreshed pressuring (rechargeability), and demonstrate its versatile tunability. These striking findings offer unprecedented insights into the underlying principles of ExB and its training, with immense technological applications in sight.

These striking findings offer unprecedented insights into the underlying principles of ExB and its training, with immense technological applications in sight.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polarization&#8208;Tunable Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Metatransistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolithic integration of a dielectric metasurface into a perovskite light&#8208;emitting transistor is demonstrated. The &#8220;metatransistor&#8221; shows an 8&#8208;fold enhancement of the electroluminescence compared to the unpatterned device. The combination of pixelated metasurfaces in the active area and electrically switchable recombination zone enables dynamic tunability of the electroluminescence polarization.








Abstract
Emerging immersive visual communication technologies require light sources with complex functionality for dynamic control of polarization, directivity, wavefront, spectrum, and intensity of light. Currently, this is mostly achieved by free space bulk optic elements, limiting the adoption of these technologies. Flat optics based on artificially structured metasurfaces that operate at the sub&#8208;wavelength scale are a viable solution, however, their integration into electrically driven devices remains challenging. Here, a radically new approach to monolithic integration of a dielectric metasurface into a perovskite light&#8208;emitting transistor is demonstrated. It is shown that nanogratings directly structured on top of the transistor channel yield an 8&#8208;fold increase of electroluminescence intensity and dynamic tunability of polarization. This new light&#8208;emitting metatransistor device concept opens unlimited opportunities for light management strategies based on metasurface design and integration.

         <title>Merging the Interfaces of Different Shape&#8208;Shifting Polymers Using Hybrid Exchange Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid exchange reactions (among ester, urethane, thiourethane, boronic&#8211;ester, and oxime&#8211;ester linkages) enable stable seamless bonding of covalently cross&#8208;linked networks made by different chemistry, as well as to produce new materials by cross&#8208;fusion. Distinctive multimaterial 3D shape&#8208;shifting structures are demonstrated since this strategy facilitates flexible design in morphology and integration of diverse properties in a monolithic recyclable and potentially healable system.








Abstract
Sophisticated shape&#8208;shifting structures and integration of advanced functions often call for different&#8208;chemistry&#8208;based polymers (such as epoxy and polyurethane) in a unified system. However, permanent cross&#8208;links pose crucial obstacles to be seamless. Here, merging interfaces via hybrid exchange reactions among different dynamic covalent bonds (including ester, urethane, thiourethane, boronic&#8211;ester, and oxime&#8211;ester linkages) is proposed, breaking the long&#8208;lasting restriction that these widely used bonds only undergo self&#8208;exchange reactions. Model compound studies are conducted to verify that hybrid exchange reactions occur. As demonstrations, different liquid crystal elastomers are tenaciously joined into coherent assemblies, with the desired biomimetic structures (e.g., flying fish containing stiff and flexible parts) and rare deformation modes (e.g., flower blooming upon both heating and cooling). Besides connecting polymers, hybrid exchange reactions also facilitate the creation of new materials through cross&#8208;fusion of different polymers. In addition to the polymers used in this work, hybrid exchange reactions can be adapted to other polymers based on similar mechanisms and beyond. Besides shape&#8208;shifting&#8208;related areas (e.g., soft robots, flexible electronics, and biomedical devices), it may also foster innovation in other fields involving general polymers, as well as promote deeper understanding of dynamic covalent chemistry.

         <title>When Chirophotonic Film Meets Wrinkles: Viewing Angle Independent Corrugated Photonic Crystal Paper</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
1D stripe and 2D wavy wrinkled photonic crystal paper are fabricated by shear coating on the wrinkled interpenetrating network rubber substrate to reflect the same color regardless of viewing angle. The wrinkled photonic crystal paper can be applied as an anti&#8208;counterfeiting film and wide&#8208;angle monochromatic light reflector.








Abstract
Light manipulation strategies of nature have fascinated humans for centuries. In particular, structural colors are of considerable interest due to their ability to control the interaction between light and matter. Here, wrinkled photonic crystal papers (PCPs) are fabricated to demonstrate the consistent reflection of colors regardless of viewing angles. The nanoscale molecular self&#8208;assembly of a cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) with a microscale corrugated surface is combined. Fully polymerizable CLC paints are uniaxially coated onto a wrinkled interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) substrate. Photopolymerization of the helicoidal nanostructures results in a flexible and free&#8208;standing PCP. The facile method of fabricating the wrinkled PCPs provides a scalable route for the development of novel chirophotonic materials with precisely controlled helical pitch and curvature dimensions. The reflection notch position of the flat PCP shifts to a lower wavelength when the viewing angle increased, while the selective reflection wavelength of wrinkled PCP is remained consistent regardless of viewing angles. The optical reflection of the 1D stripe&#8208;wrinkled PCP is dependent on the wrinkle direction. PCPs with different corrugated directions can be patterned to reduce the angular&#8208;dependent optical reflection of wrinkles. Furthermore, 2D wavy&#8208;wrinkled PCP is successfully developed that exhibit directionally independent reflection of color.

         <title>Regulation of Polymer Configurations Enables Green Solvent&#8208;Processed Large&#8208;Area Binary All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells With Breakthrough Performance and High Efficiency Stretchability Factor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regulation of the configurations of the non&#8208;conjugated polymer acceptors enables green solvent&#8208;processed large&#8208;area binary all&#8208;polymer solar cells to achieve record efficiency and robustness. This study not only provides a series of reliable novel conductive materials with excellent performance for flexible wearable solar cells but also elucidates a concept to evaluate the comprehensive performance of organic solar cells.








Abstract
With the great potential of the all&#8208;polymer solar cells for large&#8208;area wearable devices, both large&#8208;area device efficiency and mechanical flexibility are very critical but attract limited attention. In this work, from the perspective of the polymer configurations, two types of terpolymer acceptors PYTX&#8208;A and PYTX&#8208;B (X&#160;= Cl or H) are developed. The configuration difference caused by the replacement of non&#8208;conjugated units results in distinct photovoltaic performance and mechanical flexibility. Benefiting from a good match between the intrinsically slow film&#8208;forming of the active materials and the technically slow film&#8208;forming of the blade&#8208;coating process, the toluene&#8208;processed large&#8208;area (1.21 cm2) binary device achieves a record efficiency of 14.70%. More importantly, a new parameter of efficiency stretchability factor (ESF) is proposed for the first time to comprehensively evaluate the overall device performance. PM6:PYTCl&#8208;A and PM6:PYTCl&#8208;B yield significantly higher ESF than PM6:PY&#8208;IT. Further blending with non&#8208;conjugated polymer donor PM6&#8208;A, the best ESF of 3.12% is achieved for PM6&#8208;A:PYTCl&#8208;A, which is among the highest comprehensive performances.

         <title>Colloidal Quantum Dot Infrared Lasers Featuring Sub&#8208;Single&#8208;Exciton Threshold and Very High Gain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heavily doped PbS/PbSSe core/alloyed&#8208;shell colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) lead to short&#8208;wave infrared lasers with sub&#8208;single&#8208;exciton pump threshold. These CQDs exhibit strong suppression of Auger recombination thanks to their compositional grading at the core/shell interface.

The use of colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) as a gain medium in infrared laser devices has been underpinned by the need for high pumping intensities, very short gain lifetimes, and low gain coefficients. Here, PbS/PbSSe core/alloyed&#8208;shell CQDs are employed as an infrared gain medium that results in highly suppressed Auger recombination with a lifetime of 485&#160;ps, lowering the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) threshold down to 300&#160;&#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2, and showing a record high net modal gain coefficient of 2180&#160;cm&#8722;1. By doping these engineered core/shell CQDs up to nearly filling the first excited state, a significant reduction of optical gain threshold is demonstrated, measured by transient absorption, to an average&#8208;exciton population&#8208;per&#8208;dot &#12296;Nth&#12297;g of 0.45&#160;due to bleaching of the ground state absorption. This in turn have led to a fivefold reduction in ASE threshold at &#12296;Nth&#12297;ASE&#160;=&#160;0.70&#160;excitons&#8208;per&#8208;dot, associated with a gain lifetime of 280&#160;ps. Finally, these heterostructured QDs are used to achieve near&#8208;infrared lasing at 1670&#160;nm at a pump fluences corresponding to sub&#8208;single&#8208;exciton&#8208;per&#8208;dot threshold (&#12296;Nth&#12297;Las&#160;=&#160;0.87). This work brings infrared CQD lasing thresholds on par to their visible counterparts, and paves the way toward solution&#8208;processed infrared laser diodes.

&lt;p&gt;Heavily doped PbS/PbSSe core/alloyed-shell colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) lead to short-wave infrared lasers with sub-single-exciton pump threshold. These CQDs exhibit strong suppression of Auger recombination thanks to their compositional grading at the core/shell interface. Besides, they offer record high modal gain coefficient as well as long optical gain lifetime.

         <title>Tissue&#8208;Mimetic Supramolecular Polymer Networks for Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integration of non&#8208;covalent cross&#8208;links and conducting polymers enables access to an electrically conductive supramolecular polymer network (E&#8208;SPN) exhibiting tissue&#8208;mimetic softness and stretchablity. The resultant material allows for fabrication of intrinsically&#8208;stretchable, stand&#8208;alone bioelectrodes, capable of comfortably and accurately measuring electromyography signals in real time. This research will offer a step toward the design and construction of next&#8208;generation, skin&#8208;like bioelectronics.








Abstract
Addressing the mechanical mismatch between biological tissue and traditional electronic materials remains a major challenge in bioelectronics. While rigidity of such materials limits biocompatibility, supramolecular polymer networks can harmoniously interface with biological tissues as they are soft, wet, and stretchable. Here, an electrically conductive supramolecular polymer network that simultaneously exhibits both electronic and ionic conductivity while maintaining tissue&#8208;mimetic mechanical properties, providing an ideal electronic interface with the human body, is introduced. Rational design of an ultrahigh affinity host&#8211;guest ternary complex led to binding affinities (&gt;1013&#160;M&#8208;2) of over an order of magnitude greater than previous reports. Embedding these complexes as dynamic cross&#8208;links, coupled with in situ synthesis of a conducting polymer, resulted in electrically conductive supramolecular polymer networks with tissue&#8208;mimetic Young's moduli (&lt;5&#160;kPa), high stretchability (&gt;500%), rapid self&#8208;recovery and high water content (&gt;84%). Achieving such properties enabled fabrication of intrinsically&#8208;stretchable stand&#8208;alone bioelectrodes, capable of accurately monitoring electromyography signals, free from any rigid&#160;materials.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Dual&#8208;Site Cathode with a Record High Sulfur Mass Loading for High&#8208;Performance Room&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated dual&#8208;active&#8208;site cathode is developed by wreathing monolayered MoS2 and Mo1 on sulfur&#8208;doped graphene frameworks for high&#8208;performance room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur batteries. The constructed atomic level MoS2&#8208;Mo1 with delocalized electron effects facilitates substantial charge transfer and a completely reversible reaction between S and Na, thus alleviating the shuttle effect.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT&#8208;Na/S) batteries possess high potential for grid&#8208;scale stationary energy storage due to their low cost and high energy density. However, the issues arising from the low S mass loading and poor cycling stability caused by the shuttle effect of polysulfides seriously limit their operating capacity and cycling capability. Herein, sulfur&#8208;doped graphene frameworks supporting atomically dispersed 2H&#8208;MoS2 and Mo1 (S@MoS2&#8208;Mo1/SGF) with a record high sulfur mass loading of 80.9&#160;wt.% are synthesized as an integrated dual active sites cathode for RT&#8208;Na/S batteries. Impressively, the as&#8208;prepared S@MoS2&#8208;Mo1/SGF display unprecedented cyclic stability with a high initial capacity of 1017&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 and a low&#8208;capacity fading rate of 0.05% per cycle over 1000&#160;cycles. Experimental and computational results including X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and density&#8208;functional theory calculations reveal that atomic&#8208;level Mo in this integrated dual&#8208;active&#8208;site forms a delocalized electron system, which could improve the reactivity of sulfur and reaction reversibility of S and Na, greatly alleviating the shuttle effect. The findings not only provide an effective strategy to fabricate high&#8208;performance dual&#8208;site cathodes, but also deepen the understanding of their enhancement mechanisms at an atomic level.

         <title>Decoupled Solar Energy Storage and Dark Photocatalysis in a 3D Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A material is showcased that combines light harvesting, photoinduced free&#8208;electron generation, and long&#8208;lived electron storage over several weeks. This phenomenon arises from the geometry&#8208;constraining confinement of a rhenium coordination complex in a metal&#8211;organic framework. Decoupled, on&#8208;demand discharge for dark photocatalysis and light&#8208;driven multicycle recharging is demonstrated, highlighting a candidate material toward solar capacitor and solar battery systems.








Abstract
Materials enabling solar energy conversion and long&#8208;term storage for readily available electrical and chemical energy are key for off&#8208;grid energy distribution. Herein, the specific confinement of a rhenium coordination complex in a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) unlocks a unique electron accumulating property under visible&#8208;light irradiation. About 15&#160;C gMOF&#8722;1 of electric charges can be concentrated and stored for over four weeks without loss. Decoupled, on&#8208;demand discharge for electrochemical reactions and H2 evolution catalysis is shown and light&#8208;driven recharging can be conducted for &gt;10 cycles with &#8776;90% of the initial charging capacity retained. Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations link electron trapping to MOF&#8208;induced geometry constraints as well as the coordination environment of the Re&#8208;center, highlighting the key role of MOF confinement on molecular guests. This study serves as the seminal report on 3D porous colloids achieving photoaccumulation of long&#8208;lived electrons, unlocking dark photocatalysis, and a path toward solar capacitor and solar battery systems.

         <title>Ultrathin Hydrogel Films toward Breathable Skin&#8208;Integrated Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin hydrogel films are fabricated by a facile cold&#8208;lamination method and demonstrated as the skin&#8211;electronics interface. The hydrogels comply with glyphic lines and subtle minutiae on the skin surface, allowing unimpeded transepidermal water loss and breathing of the skin underneath. Multitype organic thin&#8208;film (opto)electronics can attach to the skin interfaced with the ultrathin hydrogel, realizing seamless integration and long&#8208;term applications.

On&#8208;skin electronics that offer revolutionary capabilities in personalized diagnosis, therapeutics, and human&#8211;machine interfaces require seamless integration between the skin and electronics. A common question remains whether an ideal interface can be introduced to directly bridge thin&#8208;film electronics with the soft skin, allowing the skin to breathe freely and the skin&#8208;integrated electronics to function stably. Here, an ever&#8208;thinnest hydrogel is reported that is compliant to the glyphic lines and subtle minutiae on the skin without forming air gaps, produced by a facile cold&#8208;lamination method. The hydrogels exhibit high water&#8208;vapor permeability, allowing nearly unimpeded transepidermal water loss and free breathing of the skin underneath. Hydrogel&#8208;interfaced flexible (opto)electronics without causing skin irritation or accelerated device performance deterioration are demonstrated. The long&#8208;term applicability is recorded for over one week. With combined features of extreme mechanical compliance, high permeability, and biocompatibility, the ultrathin hydrogel interface promotes the general applicability of skin&#8208;integrated electronics.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Microdomain Interlocking Polymer Electrolytes for Advanced All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Battery Chemistries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational concept of high&#8208;entropy microdomain interlocking all&#8208;solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes is designed by introducing newly polymerized multifunctional ABC miktoarm star terpolymers into polyethylene oxide. The tailor&#8208;made electrolyte shows advanced mechanical, electrochemical, and thermodynamic performances, stably enabling all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal symmetrical cell cycles over 4000&#160;h.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (ASPEs) with excellent processivity are considered one of the most forward&#8208;looking materials for large&#8208;scale industrialization. However, the contradiction between improving the mechanical strength and accelerating the ionic migration of ASPEs has always been difficult to reconcile. Herein, a rational concept is raised of high&#8208;entropy microdomain interlocking ASPEs (HEMI&#8208;ASPEs), inspired by entropic elasticity well&#8208;known in polymer and biochemical sciences, by introducing newly designed multifunctional ABC miktoarm star terpolymers into polyethylene oxide for the first time. The tailor&#8208;made HEMI&#8208;ASPEs possess multifunctional polymer chains, which induce themselves to assemble into micro&#8208; and nanoscale dynamic interlocking networks with high topological structure entropy. HEMI&#8208;ASPEs achieve excellent toughness, considerable ionic conductivity, an appreciable lithium transference number (0.63), and desirable thermal stability (Td&#160;&gt; 400&#160;&#176;C) for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. The Li|HEMI&#8208;ASPE&#8208;Li|Li symmetrical cell shows a stable Li plating/stripping performance over 4000&#160;h, and a LiFePO4|HEMI&#8208;ASPE&#8208;Li|Li full cell exhibits a high capacity retention (&#8776;96%) after 300 cycles. This work contributes an innovative design concept introducing high&#8208;entropy supramolecular dynamic networks for ASPEs.

         <title>Extremely Suppressed Energetic Disorder in a Chemically Doped Conjugated Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is discovered that the energetic disorder inevitably arising in chemically doped conjugated polymers (CPs) can be suppressed close to the theoretical limit. Even after the incorporation of significant amount of dopant, the distribution of states for intramolecular sites is maintained as narrow because of the high planarity of the CP backbone chains, resulting in excellent charge&#8208;transport properties.








Abstract
Chemical doping can be used to tune the optoelectronic properties of conjugated polymers (CPs), extending their applications as conducting materials. Unfortunately, chemically doped CP films containing excess dopants exhibit an increase in energetic disorder upon structural alteration, and Coulomb interactions between charge carriers and dopants also affect such disorder. The increase in energetic disorder leads to a broadening of the density of states, which consequently impedes efficient charge transport in chemically doped CPs. However, the molecular origins that are inherently resistant to such incidental increase of energetic disorder in chemically doped CPs have not been sufficiently explored. Here, it is discovered that energetic disorder in chemically doped CPs can be suppressed to a level close to the theoretical limit. Indacenodithiophene&#8208;co&#8208;benzothiadiazole (IDTBT) doped with triethyloxonium hexachloroantimonate (OA) exhibits disorder&#8208;free charge&#8208;transport characteristics and band&#8208;like transport behavior with astonishing carrier mobility as a result of reinforced 1D intramolecular transport. Molecular structure of IDTBT provides a capability to lower the energetic disorder that generally arises from the inclusion of heterogeneous dopants. The results suggest the possibilities of implementing disorder&#8208;free CPs that exhibit excellent charge transport characteristics in the chemically doped state and satisfy a prerequisite for their availability in the industry.

         <title>Chiral Seeded Growth of Gold Nanorods Into Fourfold Twisted Nanoparticles with Plasmonic Optical Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fourfold twisted Au nanorods can be prepared via chiral seeded growth, using cysteine as a chiral inducer. A high dissymmetry factor is obtained and electromagnetic simulations show chiral plasmon modes with largely asymmetric near&#8208;field enhancement. The mechanism involved in chiral growth is related with cysteine&#8208;induced enantioselective development of chiral facets.








Abstract
A robust and reproducible methodology to prepare stable inorganic nanoparticles with chiral morphology may hold the key to the practical utilization of these materials. An optimized chiral growth method to prepare fourfold twisted gold nanorods is described herein, where the amino acid cysteine is used as a dissymmetry inducer. Four tilted ridges are found to develop on the surface of single&#8208;crystal nanorods upon repeated reduction of HAuCl4, in the presence of cysteine as the chiral inducer and ascorbic acid as a reducing agent. From detailed electron microscopy analysis of the crystallographic structures, it is proposed that the dissymmetry results from the development of chiral facets in the form of protrusions (tilted ridges) on the initial nanorods, eventually leading to a twisted shape. The role of cysteine is attributed to assisting enantioselective facet evolution, which is supported by density functional theory simulations of the surface energies, modified upon adsorption of the chiral molecule. The development of R&#8208;type and S&#8208;type chiral structures (small facets, terraces, or kinks) would thus be non&#8208;equal, removing the mirror symmetry of the Au NR and in turn resulting in a markedly chiral morphology with high plasmonic optical activity.

         <title>Impact&#8208;Resistant Hydrogels by Harnessing 2D Hierarchical Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired hydrogels with lobster&#8208;underbelly&#8208;like properties are reported. By engineering the hierarchical structures, synthetic hydrogel materials can be enabled with the lobster&#8208;underbelly&#8208;like combinational properties, including high ballistic resistance, toughness, strength, water content, and superior softness.








Abstract
With the strengthening capacity through harnessing multi&#8208;length&#8208;scale structural hierarchy, synthetic hydrogels hold tremendous promise as a low&#8208;cost and abundant material for applications demanding unprecedented mechanical robustness. However, integrating high impact resistance and high water content, yet superior softness, in a single hydrogel material still remains a grand challenge. Here, a simple, yet effective, strategy involving bidirectional freeze&#8208;casting and compression&#8208;annealing is reported, leading to a hierarchically structured hydrogel material. Rational engineering of the distinct 2D&#160;lamellar structures, well&#8208;defined nanocrystalline domains and robust interfacial interaction among the lamellae, synergistically contributes to a record&#8208;high ballistic energy absorption capability (i.e., 2.1 kJ m&#8722;1), without sacrificing their high water content (i.e., 85 wt%) and superior softness. Together with its low&#8208;cost and extraordinary energy dissipation capacity, the hydrogel materials present a durable alternative to conventional hydrogel materials for armor&#8208;like protection&#160;circumstances.

         <title>Ultrastrong, Thermally Stable, and Food&#8208;Safe&#160;Seaweed&#8208;Based Structural Material for Tableware</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A food&#8208;safe sargassum cellulose nanofiber (SCNF) is extracted through an efficient and low energy consuming way. Then, by assembling the SCNF into a dense bulk material, a strong structural material can be prepared. It possesses good machinability, which can be processed into tableware with better overall performance than that of commercial tableware, showing great application potential in the tableware field.








Abstract
Widely used disposable plastic tableware is usually buried or directly discharged into the natural environment after using, which poses potential threats to the natural environment and human health. To solve this problem, nondegradable plastic tableware needs to be replaced by tableware composed of biodegradable structural materials with both food safety and the excellent mechanical and thermal properties. Here, a food&#8208;safe sargassum cellulose nanofiber (SCNF) is extracted from common seaweed in an efficient and low energy consuming way under mild reaction conditions. Then, by assembling the SCNF into a dense bulk material, a strong sargassum cellulose nanofiber structural material (SCNSM) with high strength (283&#160;MPa) and high thermal stability (&gt;160&#160;&#176;C) can be prepared. The SCNSM also possesses good machinability, which can be processed into tableware with different shapes, e.g., knives and forks. The overall performance of the SCNSM&#8208;based tableware is better than commercial plastic, wood&#8208;based, and poly(lactic acid) tableware, which shows great application potential in the tableware field.

         <title>Tolerogenic Nanovaccine for Prevention and Treatment of Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tolerogenic nanovaccine is constructed to deliver a self&#8208;antigen and dexamethasone on an abatacept&#8208;modified polydopamine nanoparticle. In experimental&#8208;autoimmune encephalomyelitis model mice, preimmunization of the nanovaccine completely blocks the development of clinical symptoms. Immunization after the self&#8208;antigen injection ameliorates the symptoms of autoimmune encephalomyelitis. The concept of tolerogenic nanovaccine can be applied to other autoimmune diseases.








Abstract
Herein, a tolerogenic nanovaccine is developed and tested on an animal model of multiple sclerosis. The nanovaccine is constructed to deliver the self&#8208;antigen, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptide, and dexamethasone on an abatacept&#8208;modified polydopamine core nanoparticle (AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG). AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG can target dendritic cells and undergo endocytosis followed by trafficking to lysosomes. AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG blocks the interaction between CD80/CD86 and CD28 in antigen&#8208;presenting cells and T cells, leading to decreased interferon gamma secretion. The subcutaneous administration of AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG to mice yields significant biodistribution to lymph nodes and, in experimental&#8208;autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model mice, increases the integrity of the myelin basic sheath and minimizes the infiltration of immune cells. EAE mice are treated with AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG before or after injection of the autoantigen, MOG. Preimmunization of AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG before the injection of MOG completely blocks the development of clinical symptoms. Early treatment with AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG at three days after injection of MOG also completely blocks the development of symptoms. Notably, treatment of EAE symptom&#8208;developed mice with AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG significantly alleviates the symptoms, indicating that the nanovaccine has therapeutic effects. Although AbaLDPN is used for MOG peptide delivery in the EAE model, the concept of AbaLDPN can be widely applied for the prevention and alleviation of other autoimmune diseases.

         <title>Tailoring Poly(Styrene&#8208;co&#8208;maleic anhydride) Networks for All&#8208;Polymer Dielectrics Exhibiting Ultrahigh Energy Density and Charge&#8211;Discharge Efficiency at Elevated Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrahigh discharged energy densities at elevated temperatures are achieved in all&#8208;organic crosslinked polymer dielectrics by tailoring polymer networks at the molecular level. This work provides new insights into the polymer structures that control electrical conduction at high&#8208;temperatures and high&#8208;fields, which will propel the development of scalable capacitive dielectrics for harsh&#8208;environment applications.








Abstract
Polymer film capacitors have been widely used in electronics and electrical power systems due to their advantages of high power densities, fast charge&#8211;discharge speed, and great stability. However, the exponential increase of electrical conduction with temperature and applied electric field substantially degrades the capacitive performance of dielectric polymers at elevated temperatures. Here, the first example of controlling the energy level of charge traps in all&#8208;organic crosslinked polymers by tailoring molecular structures that significantly inhibit high&#8208;field high&#8208;temperature conduction loss, which largely differs from current approaches based on the introduction of inorganic fillers, is reported. The polymer network with optimized crosslinking structures exhibits an ultrahigh discharged energy density of 7.02&#8201;J&#8201;cm&#8722;3 with charge/discharge efficiencies of &gt;90% at 150&#160;&#176;C, far outperforming current dielectric polymers and composites. The charge&#8208;trapping effects in different crosslinked structures, as the origins of the marked improvements in the high&#8208;temperature capacitive performance, are comprehensively investigated experimentally and confirmed computationally. Moreover, excellent cyclability and self&#8208;healing features are demonstrated in the polymer film capacitors. This work offers a promising pathway of molecular structure design to scalable high&#8208;energy&#8208;density polymer dielectrics capable of operating under harsh environments.

         <title>Ultrathin Cellulose Nanofiber Assisted Ambient&#8208;Pressure&#8208;Dried, Ultralight, Mechanically Robust, Multifunctional MXene Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Employing the renewable, ultrathin, large&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio cellulose nanofiber (CNF) as a cross&#8208;linker, the large&#8208;area, ultralight yet robust MXene&#8208;based aerogels with multifunctionality are prepared through the simple, energy&#8208;efficient, and scalable ambient&#8208;pressure&#8208;dried approach. The synergies of the MXene, CNF, and abundant pores efficiently improve the EMI shielding performance, dye adsorption, photothermal conversion, and absorption of viscous crude oil.








Abstract
Ambient&#8208;pressure&#8208;dried (APD) preparation of transition metal carbide/nitrides (MXene) aerogels is highly desirable yet remains highly challenging. Here, ultrathin, high&#8208;strength&#8208;to&#8208;weight&#8208;ratio, renewable cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) are efficiently utilized to assist in the APD preparation of ultralight yet robust, highly conductive, large&#8208;area MXene&#8208;based aerogels via a facile, energy&#8208;efficient, eco&#8208;friendly, and scalable freezing&#8208;exchanging&#8208;drying approach. The strong interactions of large&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio CNF and MXene as well as the biomimetic nacre&#8208;like microstructure induce high mechanical strength and stability to avoid the structure collapse of aerogels in the APD process. Abundant functional groups of CNFs facilitate the chemical crosslinking of MXene&#8208;based aerogels, significantly improving the hydrophobicity, water resistance, and even oxidation stability. The ultrathin, 1D nature of the CNF renders the minimal MXenes&#8217; interlayered gaps and numerous heterogeneous interfaces, yielding the excellent conductivity and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding performance of aerogels. The synergies of the MXene, CNF, and abundant pores efficiently improve the EMI shielding performance, photothermal conversion, and absorption of viscous crude oil. This work shows great promises of the APD, multifunctional MXene&#8208;based aerogels in electromagnetic protection or compatibility, thermal therapy, and oil&#8208;water separation applications.

         <title>A Hemispherical Image Sensor Array Fabricated with Organic Photomemory Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors develop a photolithographic process to prepare a hemispherical image sensor array using one organic thin film photomemory transistor per pixel. Their organic thin&#8208;film photomemory transistors can achieve linear photoresponse, along with the best responsivity for similar dark currents among all the reported hemispherical image sensor arrays to date.








Abstract
Hemispherical image sensors simplify lens designs, reduce optical aberrations, and improve image resolution for compact wide&#8208;field&#8208;of&#8208;view cameras. To achieve hemispherical image sensors, organic materials are promising candidates due to the following advantages: tunability of optoelectronic/spectral response and low&#8208;temperature low&#8208;cost processes. Here, a photolithographic process is developed to prepare a hemispherical image sensor array using organic thin film photomemory transistors with a density of 308 pixels per square centimeter. This design includes only one photomemory transistor as a single active pixel, in contrast to the conventional pixel architecture, consisting of select/readout/reset transistors and a photodiode. The organic photomemory transistor, comprising light&#8208;sensitive organic semiconductor and charge&#8208;trapping dielectric, is able to achieve a linear photoresponse (light intensity range, from 1 to 50&#160;W m&#8722;2), along with a responsivity as high as 1.6 A W&#8722;1 (wavelength = 465&#160;nm) for a dark current of 0.24 A m&#8722;2 (drain voltage =&#160;&#8722;1.5&#160;V). These observed values represent the best responsivity for similar dark currents among all the reported hemispherical image sensor arrays to date. A transfer method was&#160;further developed that does not damage organic materials for hemispherical organic photomemory transistor arrays. These developed techniques are scalable and are amenable for other high&#8208;resolution 3D organic semiconductor devices.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetic Skyrmions and Large Topological Hall Effect in Chromium Telluride Engineered by Self&#8208;Intercalation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic skyrmions and large topological Hall effect are demonstrated in chromium telluride. The Curie temperature and magnetic anisotropy in Cr1+xTe2 can be controlled by the self&#8208;intercalate concentration x. In Cr1.53Te2, which has a Curie temperature of 295&#160;K and a relatively weak perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, room&#8208;temperature skyrmions and topological Hall resistivity as large as &#8776;106&#160;n&#937;&#160;cm are observed.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature magnetic skyrmion materials exhibiting robust topological Hall effect (THE) are crucial for novel nano&#8208;spintronic devices. However, such skyrmion&#8208;hosting materials are rare in nature. In this study, a self&#8208;intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide Cr1+xTe2 with a layered crystal structure that hosts room&#8208;temperature skyrmions and exhibits large THE is reported. By tuning the self&#8208;intercalate concentration, a monotonic control of Curie temperature from 169 to 333&#160;K and a magnetic anisotropy transition from out&#8208;of&#8208;plane to the in&#8208;plane configuration are achieved. Based on the intercalation engineering, room&#8208;temperature skyrmions are successfully created in Cr1.53Te2 with a Curie temperature of 295&#160;K and a relatively weak perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Remarkably, a skyrmion&#8208;induced topological Hall resistivity as large as &#8776;106&#160;n&#937; cm is observed at 290&#160;K. Moreover, a sign reversal of THE is also found at low temperatures, which can be ascribed to other topological spin textures having an opposite topological charge to that of the skyrmions. Therefore, chromium telluride can be a new paradigm of the skyrmion material family with promising prospects for future device applications.

         <title>Pt Single Atoms on CrN Nanoparticles Deliver Outstanding Activity and CO Tolerance in the Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt single&#8208;atom catalysts with novel and small&#8208;sized CrN nanoparticles as potential support is successfully prepared by atomic layer deposition method and exhibit superior activity and CO&#8208;tolerance toward hydrogen oxidation reaction, which is of great significance for the full utilization of low&#8208;cost H2 with impurity CO in proton exchange membrane fuel cells.








Abstract
The large&#8208;scale application of proton exchange membrane fuel cells is currently hampered by high cost of commercial Pt catalysts and their susceptibility to poisoning by CO impurities in H2 feed. In this context, the development of CO&#8208;tolerant electrocatalysts with high Pt atom utilization efficiency for hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is of critical importance. Herein, Pt single atoms are successfully immobilized on chromium nitride nanoparticles by atomic layer deposition method, denoted as Pt SACs/CrN. Electrochemical tests establish Pt SACs/CrN to be a very efficient HOR catalyst, with a mass activity that is 5.7 times higher than commercial PtRu/C. Strikingly, the excellent performance of Pt SACs/CrN is maintained after introducing 1000&#160;ppm of CO in H2 feed. The excellent CO&#8208;tolerance of Pt SACs/CrN is related to weaker CO adsorption on Pt single atoms. This work provides guidelines for the design and construction of active and CO&#8208;tolerant catalysts for HOR.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Crowding Effect Mimicking Cold&#8208;Resistant Plants to Stabilize the Zinc Anode with Wider Service Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular crowding electrolyte is developed for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Betaine in the electrolyte can regulate the solvation sheath of Zn2+ and adsorb on the Zn anode to guide the dendrite&#8208;free deposition of Zn2+. A high concentration of betaine breaks the H&#8208;bond between H2O, which keeps the Zn anode stable in a wide temperature range from &#8722;30 to 60 &#176;C.








Abstract
Growth of dendrites, the low plating/stripping efficiency of Zn anodes, and the high freezing point of aqueous electrolytes hinder the practical application of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Here, a zwitterionic osmolyte&#8208;based molecular crowding electrolyte is presented, by adding betaine (Bet, a by&#8208;product from beet plant) to the aqueous electrolyte, to solve the abovementioned problems. Substantive verification tests, density functional theory calculations, and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations consistently reveal that side reactions and growth of Zn dendrites are restrained because Bet can break Zn2+ solvation and regulate oriented 2D Zn2+ deposition. The Bet/ZnSO4 electrolyte enables superior reversibility in a Zn&#8211;Cu half&#8208;cell to achieve a high Coulombic efficiency &gt;99.9% for 900 cycles (&#8776;1800 h), and dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping in Zn&#8211;Zn cells for 4235 h at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2 and 0.5 mAh cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, a high concentration of Bet lowers the freezing point of the electrolyte to &#8722;92 &#176;C via the molecular&#8208;crowding effect, which ensures the stable operation of the aqueous batteries at &#8722;30 &#176;C. This innovative concept of such a molecular crowding electrolyte will inject new vitality into the development of multifunctional aqueous electrolytes.

Mesoporous PdN alloy nanocubes are reported as the highly active and selective electrocatalyst for electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate to recyclable ammonia (NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3). The remarkable performance results from combined synergies of mesoporous structure and PdN alloy, which facilitate the adsorption and reactivity of NO3&#8722; and enhance the retention time of electrocatalyzing NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 through an eight&#8208;electron transfer pathway.








Abstract
Developing highly active and selective electrocatalysts for electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NITRR) is very important for synthesizing recyclable ammonia (NH3) in an economic and environmentally friendly manner. Despite some encouraging progress, their activity and selectivity have been remarkably slower than expected. In this manuscript, mesoporous palladium&#8208;nonmetal (meso&#8208;PdX) nanocubes (NCs) are reported as a new series of highly efficient electrocatalysts for selective nitrate reduction reaction (NITRR) electrocatalysis to NH3. The samples feature uniformly alloyed compositions and highly penetrated mesopores with abundant highly active sites and optimized electronic structures. The best meso&#8208;PdN NCs hold an outstanding NITRR activity and selectivity with a remarkable NH3 Faradaic efficiency of 96.1% and a yield rate of 3760&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1, suppressing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. Meanwhile, meso&#8208;PdN NCs are electrocatalytically stable, retaining well the activity and selectivity of NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 electrocatalysis for more than 20 cycles. Detailed mechanism studies ascribe the superior performance to combined compositional and structural synergies of meso&#8208;PdN NCs that not only promote the adsorption (reactivity) of NO3&#8722; and the desorption of NH3 but also increase the retention time of key intermediates for the deeper NITRR electrocatalysis to NH3 through an eight&#8208;electron pathway.

         <title>Bifacial Dye Membranes: Ultrathin and Free&#8208;Standing although not Being Covalently Bound</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of template layers for extension of Langmuir&#8208;Blodgett and related techniques to utilize water&#8208;soluble dyes for the synthesis of quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional molecular layers at the water&#8208;air interface is . Bilayers and intercalated layers stable enough to span 25 &#181;m &#215; 25 &#181;m meshes, although not covalently bonded, are demonstrated. Scalable fabrication of these broadly absorbing pi&#8208;conjugated films is realized via a modified roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll process.








Abstract
Layers of aligned dyes are key to photo&#8208;driven charge separation in dye sensitized solar cells, but cannot be exploited as rectifying membranes in photocatalysis to separate half&#8208;cells because they are not sufficiently stable. While impressive work on the fabrication of stable noncovalent membranes has been recently demonstrated, these membranes are inherently suffering from non&#8208;uniform orientation of the constituting dyes. To stabilize layers made from uniformly assembled and aligned dyes, they can be covalently cross&#8208;linked via functional groups or via chromophores at the expense of their optical properties. Here stable membranes from established dyes are reported that do not need to be elaborately functionalized nor do their chromophores need to be destroyed. These membranes are free&#8208;standing, although being only non&#8208;covalently linked. To enable uniform dye&#8208;alignment, Langmuir layers made from linear, water&#8208;insoluble dyes are used. That water&#8208;soluble charge transfer dyes adsorb onto and intercalate into the Langmuir layer from the aqueous subphase, thus yielding free&#8208;standing, molecularly thin membranes are demonstrated. The developed bifacial layers consist almost entirely of &#960;&#8208;conjugated units and thus can conduct charges and can be further engineered for optoelectronic and photocatalytic applications.

Chiral Nanoparticles
In article number 2208299, Bing Ni, Sara Bals, Luis M. Liz&#8208;Marz&#225;n, and co&#8208;workers show how plasmonic optical activity in chiral nanoparticles can be tuned and optimized through the chiral morphological details. Twisted gold nanorods evolve through removal of mirror symmetry during dissymmetric seeded growth. Both experimental and theoretical analysis indicates that the underlying mechanism relates to cysteine&#8208;induced enantioselective development of chiral facets. The resulting 4&#8208;fold twisted structure leads to high dissymmetry factors.

Light&#8208;Emitting Metatransistors
A radically new light&#8208;emitting device concept, the perovskite light&#8208;emitting metatransistor, which enables active tunability of electroluminescence intensity, polarization, and spectrum, is demonstrated in article number 2207317 by Cesare Soci and co&#8208;workers. Monolithic integration of dielectric perovskite metasurfaces in the active region of electrically driven devices offers new routes for light control.

Charge Storage
Long live the electron! Solar&#8208;energy conversion and long&#8208;term storage for on&#8208;demand electrical and chemical energy are crucial toward decentralized energy distribution. In article number 2207280, Julien Warnan and co&#8208;workers show how a hybrid material from a metal&#8211;organic framework and molecular rhenium complex enables light&#8208;driven accumulation of long&#8208;lived electrons. Full charge storage over several weeks is achieved as well as on&#8208;demand &#8220;dark photocatalysis&#8221; for decoupled hydrogen evolution.

         <title>Smart Eutectic Gallium&#8211;Indium: From Properties to Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article gives a comprehensive overview of the unique properties and wide applications of liquid metal eutectic gallium&#8211;indium (EGaIn). The working principles for the EGaIn&#8208;based devices are illustrated and the developments of EGaIn&#8208;related techniques are summarized. The main challenges for the development of EGaIn&#8208;related techniques are analyzed and the potential applications of EGaIn in the new fields are prospected.








Abstract
Eutectic gallium&#8211;indium (EGaIn), a liquid metal with a melting point close to or below room temperature, has attracted extensive attention in recent years due to its excellent properties such as fluidity, high conductivity, thermal conductivity, stretchability, self&#8208;healing capability, biocompatibility, and recyclability. These features of EGaIn can be adjusted by changing the experimental condition, and various composite materials with extended properties can be further obtained by mixing EGaIn with other materials. In this review, not only the are unique properties of EGaIn introduced, but also the working principles for the EGaIn&#8208;based devices are illustrated and the developments of EGaIn&#8208;related techniques are summarized. The applications of EGaIn in various fields, such as flexible electronics (sensors, antennas, electronic circuits), molecular electronics (molecular memory, opto&#8208;electronic switches, or reconfigurable junctions), energy catalysis (heat management, motors, generators, batteries), biomedical science (drug delivery, tumor therapy, bioimaging and neural interfaces) are reviewed. Finally, a critical discussion of the main challenges for the development of EGaIn&#8208;based techniques are discussed, and the potential applications in new fields are prospected.

         <title>Recent Progress in Developing a LiOH&#8208;Based Reversible Nonaqueous Lithium&#8211;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress in developing LiOH&#8208;based nonaqueous lithium&#8211;air batteries is reviewed, with emphasis in providing an updated understanding of the oxygen reduction/evolution reactions during cell operation. Many fundamental questions remain unanswered on the identities of the reaction intermediates, locations of reaction interfaces, causes of parasitic reactions, and the effect of CO2&#160;on the LiOH electrochemistry, which all warrant further investigation.








Abstract
The realization of practical nonaqueous lithium&#8211;air batteries (LABs) calls for novel strategies to address their numerous theoretical and technical challenges. LiOH formation/decomposition has recently been proposed as a promising alternative route to cycling LABs via Li2O2. Herein, the progress in developing LiOH&#8208;based nonaqueous LABs is reviewed. Various catalytic systems, either soluble or solid&#8208;state, that can activate a LiOH&#8208;based electrochemistry are compared in detail, with emphasis in providing an updated understanding of the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in nonaqueous media.&#160;We&#160;identify the key factors that can switch the cell chemistry between Li2O2&#160;and LiOH and highlight the debate around these routes, as well as rationalize potential causes for these opposing opinions. The identities of the reaction intermediates, activity of redox mediators and additives, location of reaction interfaces, causes of parasitic reactions, as well as the effect of CO2&#160;on the LiOH electrochemistry, all play a critical role in altering the relative rates of a series of interconnected reactions and all warrant further investigation.

The identities of the reaction intermediates, activity of redox mediators and additives, location of reaction interfaces, causes of parasitic reactions, as well as the effect of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;on the LiOH electrochemistry, all play a critical role in altering the relative rates of a series of interconnected reactions and all warrant further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tungsten&#8208;based Nanomaterials in the Biomedical Field: A Bibliometric Analysis of Research Progress and Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research progress and prospects of tungsten&#8208;based nanomaterials in biomedical field are analyzed by bibliometrics. First, general bibliometric distributions of the dataset by year/country/institute/referenced source/research hotspots are recognized. Next, to provide a comprehensive review of the subjectively recognized research hotspots in biomedical fields (including biological sensing, anticancer treatments, antibacterials, and toxicity evaluation). Finally, prospects and challenges are discussed.








Abstract
Tungsten&#8208;based nanomaterials (TNMs) with diverse nanostructures and unique physicochemical properties have been widely applied in the biomedical field. Although various reviews have described the application of TNMs in specific biomedical fields, there are still no comprehensive studies that summarize and analyze research trends of the field as a whole. To identify and further promote the development of biomedical TNMs, a bibliometric analysis method is used to analyze all relevant literature on this topic. First, general bibliometric distributions of the dataset by year, country, institute, referenced source, and research hotspots are recognized. Next, a comprehensive review of the subjectively recognized research hotspots in various biomedical fields, including biological sensing, anticancer treatments, antibacterials, and toxicity evaluation, is provided. Finally, the prospects and challenges of TNMs are discussed to provide a new perspective for further promoting their development in biomedical research.

Abstract
Thermoelectric technology provides a promising solution to sustainable energy utilization and scalable power supply. Recently, Ag2Q&#8208;based (Q&#160;=&#160;S, Se, Te) silver chalcogenides have come forth as potential thermoelectric materials that are endowed with complex crystal structures, high carrier mobility coupled with low lattice thermal conductivity, and even exceptional plasticity. This review presents the latest advances in this material family, from binary compounds to ternary and quaternary alloys, covering the understanding of multi&#8208;scale structures and peculiar properties, the optimization of thermoelectric performance, and the rational design of new materials. The &#8220;composition&#8208;phase structure&#8208;thermoelectric/mechanical properties&#8221; correlation is emphasized. Flexible and hetero&#8208;shaped thermoelectric prototypes based on Ag2Q materials are also demonstrated. Several key problems and challenges are put forward concerning further understanding and optimization of Ag2Q&#8208;based thermoelectric chalcogenides.

         <title>Well&#8208;Defined Fullerene Bisadducts Enable High&#8208;Performance Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure&#8208;dependent effects of the four fullerene bisadduct regioisomers on the device performance of tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells are systemically investigated. Benefiting from the favorable molecular packing, energy level alignment, and interfacial interaction, the trans&#8208;3&#8208;based devices yield a champion efficiency of 14.58% with a certified efficiency of 14.30%, representing one of the best&#8208;performing tin&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) are attracting intense research interest due to their excellent optoelectric properties and eco&#8208;friendly features. To further improve the device performance, developing new fullerene derivatives as electron transporter layers (ETLs) is highly demanded. Four well&#8208;defined regioisomers (trans&#8208;2, trans&#8208;3, trans&#8208;4, and e) of diethylmalonate&#8208;C60 bisadduct (DCBA) are isolated and well characterized. The well&#8208;defined molecular structure enables us to investigate the real structure&#8208;dependent effects on photovoltaic performance. It is found that the chemical structures of the regioisomers not only affect their energy levels, but also lead to significant differences in their molecular packings and interfacial contacts. As a result, the devices with trans&#8208;2, trans&#8208;3, trans&#8208;4, and e as ETLs yield efficiencies of 11.69%, 14.58%, 12.59%, and 10.55%, respectively, which are higher than that of the as&#8208;prepared DCBA&#8208;based (10.28%) device. Notably, the trans&#8208;3&#8208;based device also demonstrates a certified efficiency of 14.30%, representing one of the best&#8208;performing TPSCs.

         <title>Highly Stretchable and Biocompatible Wrinkled Nanoclay&#8208;Composite Hydrogel With Enhanced Sensing Capability for Precise Detection of Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel bioinspired nanoclay&#8208;composite wrinkled hydrogel sensor is developed with excellent mechanical and biocompatible properties and high and reliable sensing capacity due to the structural&#8211;mechanical&#8211;electrical integrity of the wrinkle micropattern and nanoclay&#8208;reinforced interpenetrating crosslinked network. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, this hydrogel sensor can accurately localize the region where myocardial infarction occurs, showing promise for real&#8208;time monitoring of pathological heart tissue.








Abstract
It is challenging to balance high biocompability with good mechanical&#8211;electrical sensing performance, especially when triggering inflammatory stress response after in vivo implantation. Herein, a bioinspired wrinkle&#8208;reinforced adaptive nanoclay&#8208;interlocked soft strain&#8208;sensor based on a highly stretchable and elastic ionic&#8208;conductive hydrogel is reported. This novel nanoclay&#8208;composite hydrogel exhibits excellent tensile properties and high sensing capacity with steady and reliable sensing performance due to the structural&#8211;mechanical&#8211;electrical integrity of the nanoclay crosslinked and nano&#8208;reinforced interpenetrating network. The incorporation of amphiphilic ions provides the hydrogel with significant protein resistance, reducing its non&#8208;specific adsorption to proteins upon implantation, improving its biosafety as an implanted device, and maintaining the authenticity of the sensing results. Based on the revealed sensing enhanced mechanism based on hierarchical ordered structures as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, this hydrogel sensor is demonstrated to be able to&#160;accurately localize the region where myocardial infarction occurs and may become a novel strategy for real&#8208;time monitoring of pathological changes in heart disease.

         <title>Thermally Crosslinked Hole Conductor Enables Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with 23.9% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple small molecule 10&#8208;(4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;3,7&#8208;bis(4&#8208;vinylphenyl)&#8208;10H&#8208;phenoxazine is developed for in situ fabrication of polymer hole conductor (CL&#8208;MCz) via a facile and low&#8208;temperature cross&#8208;linking technology. The device with CL&#8208;MCz yields a champion power conversion efficiency of 23.9% along with an extremely low energy loss down to 0.41 eV.








Abstract
Poly[bis(4&#8208;phenyl)(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) represents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hole transport material (HTM) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, unsatisfied surface properties of PTAA and high energy disorder in the bulk film hinder the further enhancement of device performance. Herein, a simple small molecule 10&#8208;(4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;3,7&#8208;bis(4&#8208;vinylphenyl)&#8208;10H&#8208;phenoxazine (MCz&#8208;VPOZ) is strategically developed for in situ fabrication of polymer hole conductor (CL&#8208;MCz) via a facile and low&#8208;temperature cross&#8208;linking technology. The resulting polymer CL&#8208;MCz offers high energy ordering and improved electrical conductivity, as well as appropriate energy&#8208;level alignment, enabling efficient charge carrier collection in the devices.

Furthermore, the corresponding unencapsulated devices exhibit competitive shelf&#8208;life stability under various operational stressors up to 2500 h, reflecting high promises of CL&#8208;MCz in the scalable PSC application. This work underscores the promising potential of the cross&#8208;linking approach in preparing low&#8208;cost, stable, and efficient polymer HTMs toward reliable PSCs.

&lt;p&gt;A simple small molecule 10-(4-(3,6-dimethoxy-9H-carbazol-9-yl)phenyl)-3,7-bis(4-vinylphenyl)-10H-phenoxazine is developed for in situ fabrication of polymer hole conductor (CL-MCz) via a facile and low-temperature cross-linking technology.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) represents the state-of-the-art hole transport material (HTM) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, unsatisfied surface properties of PTAA and high energy disorder in the bulk film hinder the further enhancement of device performance. Herein, a simple small molecule 10-(4-(3,6-dimethoxy-9H-carbazol-9-yl)phenyl)-3,7-bis(4-vinylphenyl)-10H-phenoxazine (MCz-VPOZ) is strategically developed for in situ fabrication of polymer hole conductor (CL-MCz) via a facile and low-temperature cross-linking technology.

         <title>Electron Conductive and Transparent Hydrogels for Recording Brain Neural Signals and Neuromodulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is proposed to break the current bottleneck of implantable materials, which demonstrate a suit of desirable performances including matched modulus, good transparency, and high conductivity. The hydrogel electrode is successfully utilized for optogenetic neuromodulation and simultaneously recording the brain's neural signals, establishing the correlation between brain neural signals and corresponding limb behavior.








Abstract
Recording brain neural signals and optogenetic neuromodulations open&#160;frontiers in decoding brain neural information and neurodegenerative disease therapeutics. Conventional implantable probes suffer from modulus mismatch with biological tissues and an irreconcilable tradeoff between transparency and electron conductivity. Herein, a strategy is proposed to address these tradeoffs, which generates conductive and transparent hydrogels with polypyrrole&#8208;decorated microgels as cross&#8208;linkers. The optical transparency of the electrodes can be attributed to the special structures that allow light waves to bypass the microgel particles and minimize their interaction. Demonstrated by probing the hippocampus of rat brains, the biomimetic electrode shows a prolonged capacity for simultaneous optogenetic neuromodulation and recording of brain neural signals. More importantly, an intriguing brain&#8211;machine interaction is realized, which involves signal input to the brain, brain neural signal generation, and controlling limb behaviors. This breakthrough work represents a significant scientific advancement toward decoding brain neural information and developing neurodegenerative disease therapies.

         <title>Light&#8208;Fueled Nonreciprocal Self&#8208;Oscillators for Fluidic Transportation and Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;sustained motions are widely reported in stimuli&#8208;responsive material systems. Here, a cilia&#8208;like&#160;soft actuator that can perform self&#8208;sustained oscillation under water, with programmable nonreciprocal strokes, is demonstrated. The self&#8208;oscillators can realize microfluidic pumping, translocation of a micro&#8208;object, and coupling between two non&#8208;equilibrium material pieces through fluidic interaction in an autonomous manner.








Abstract
Light&#8208;fueled self&#8208;oscillators based on soft actuating materials have triggered novel designs for small&#8208;scale robotic constructs that self&#8208;sustain their motion at non&#8208;equilibrium states and possess bioinspired autonomy and adaptive functions. However, the motions of most self&#8208;oscillators are reciprocal, which hinders their use in sophisticated biomimetic functions such as fluidic transportation. Here, an optically powered soft material strip that can perform nonreciprocal, cilia&#8208;like,&#160;self&#8208;sustained oscillation under water is reported. The actuator is made of planar&#8208;aligned liquid crystal elastomer responding to visible light. Two laser beams from orthogonal directions allow for piecewise control over the strip deformation, enabling two self&#8208;shadowing effects coupled in one single material to yield nonreciprocal strokes. The nonreciprocity, stroke pattern and handedness are connected to the fluidic pumping efficiency, which can be controlled by the excitation conditions. Autonomous microfluidic pumping in clockwise and anticlockwise directions, translocation of a micro&#8208;object by liquid propulsion, and coupling between two oscillating strips through liquid medium interaction are demonstrated. The results offer new concepts for non&#8208;equilibrium soft actuators that can perform bio&#8208;like functions under water.

         <title>Efficient Red Light Emitting Diodes Based on a Zero&#8208;Dimensional Organic Antimony Halide Hybrid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly luminescent zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic antimony bromide hybrid containing semiconducting organic cation is developed for the first time, with which electrically driven red light emitting diodes (LEDs) are fabricated to exhibit an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.12%, a peak luminance of 5957&#160;cd m&#8722;2, and a current efficiency of 14.2 cd A&#8722;1.








Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs) have recently emerged as a new class of light emitting materials with exceptional color tunability. While near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum efficiencies (PLQEs) are routinely obtained for a large number of 0D OMHHs, it remains challenging to apply them as emitter for electrically driven light emitting diodes (LEDs), largely due to the low conductivity of wide bandgap organic cations. Here, the development of a new OMHH, triphenyl(9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl) phosphonium antimony bromide (TPPcarzSbBr4), as emitter for efficient LEDs, which consists of semiconducting organic cations (TPPcarz+) and light emitting antimony bromide anions (Sb2Br82&#8722;), is reported. By replacing one of the phenyl groups in a well&#8208;known tetraphenylphosphonium cation (TPP+) with an electroactive phenylcarbazole group, a semiconducting TPPcarz+ cation is developed for the preparation of red emitting 0D TPPcarzSbBr4 single crystals with a high PLQE of 93.8%. With solution processed TPPcarzSbBr4 thin films (PLQE of 86.1%) as light emitting layer, red LEDs are fabricated to exhibit an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.12%, a peak luminance of 5957&#160;cd m&#8722;2, and a current efficiency of 14.2&#160;cd A&#8722;1, which are the best values reported to date for electroluminescence devices based on 0D OMHHs.

         <title>Unusual Spectrally Reproducible and High Q&#8208;Factor Random Lasing in Polycrystalline Tin Perovskite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly spectrally reproducible multimode random lasing is observed in thin polycrystalline films of tin iodide perovskite that cannot be explained by a strong mode localization. The observed spectral reproducibility can be due to the strong inhomogeneous broadening of photoluminescence spectra measured in tin&#8208;based perovskites on the basis of a comparison with an analogous Pb&#8208;based counterpart.








Abstract
An unusual spectrally reproducible near&#8208;IR random lasing (RL) with no fluctuation of lasing peak wavelength is disclosed in polycrystalline films of formamidinium tin triiodide perovskite, which have been chemically stabilized against Sn2+ to Sn4+ oxidation. Remarkably, a quality Q&#8208;factor as high as &#8776;104 with an amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) threshold as low as 2&#160;&#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2 (both at 20&#160;K) are achieved. The observed spectral reproducibility is unprecedented for semiconductor thin film RL systems and cannot be explained by the strong spatial localization of lasing modes. Instead, it is suggested that the spectral stability is a result of such an unique property of Sn&#8208;based perovskites as a large inhomogeneous broadening of the emitting centers, which is a consequence of an intrinsic structural inhomogeneity of the material. Due to this, lasing can occur simultaneously in modes that are spatially strongly overlapped, as long as the spectral separation between the modes is larger than the homogeneous linewidth of the emitting centers. The discovered mechanism of RL spectral stability in semiconductor materials, possessing inhomogeneous broadening, opens up prospects for their practical use as cheap sources of narrow laser lines.

         <title>Observation of Multi&#8208;Directional Energy Transfer in a Hybrid Plasmonic&#8211;Excitonic Nanostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrafast charge and energy exchange across the interface of a hybrid plasmonic heterostructure are explored with momentum resolved electron spectroscopy and diffraction. The results identify a multi&#8208;directional energy exchange on timescales shorter than the electronic thermalization of the nanometal, driven by a non&#8208;linear plasmon&#8211;exciton interaction. Non&#8208;radiative exciton recombination, electron&#8211;phonon coupling, and diffusive charge&#8208;transfer determine the subsequent energy backflow.








Abstract
Hybrid plasmonic devices involve a nanostructured metal supporting localized surface plasmons to amplify light&#8211;matter interaction, and a non&#8208;plasmonic material to functionalize charge excitations. Application&#8208;relevant epitaxial heterostructures, however, give rise to ballistic ultrafast dynamics that challenge the conventional semiclassical understanding of unidirectional nanometal&#8208;to&#8208;substrate energy transfer. Epitaxial Au nanoislands are studied on WSe2 with time&#8208; and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy and femtosecond electron diffraction: this combination of techniques resolves material, energy, and momentum of charge&#8208;carriers and phonons excited in the heterostructure. A strong non&#8208;linear plasmon&#8211;exciton interaction that transfers the energy of sub&#8208;bandgap photons very efficiently to the semiconductor is observed, leaving the metal cold until non&#8208;radiative exciton recombination heats the nanoparticles on hundreds of femtoseconds timescales. The results resolve a multi&#8208;directional energy exchange on timescales shorter than the electronic thermalization of the nanometal. Electron&#8211;phonon coupling and diffusive charge&#8208;transfer determine the subsequent energy flow. This complex dynamics opens perspectives for optoelectronic and photocatalytic applications, while providing a constraining experimental testbed for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art&#160;modelling.

         <title>Initiating Reversible Aqueous Copper&#8211;Tellurium Conversion Reaction with High Volumetric Capacity through Electrolyte Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The copper&#8211;tellurium conversion reaction with high volumetric capacity of 3927&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;3 and long discharge plateau are investigated. The thermodynamic&#8211;kinetic asymmetries of the Cu&#8211;Te multiphase&#8208;conversion and oxidation&#8208;failure mechanisms are systematically revealed. The developed precise electrolyte engineering overcomes inherent oxidative distress and extends the cycling life of the battery by about three orders of magnitude.








Abstract
Pursuing conversion&#8208;type cathodes with high volumetric capacity that can be used in aqueous environments remains rewarding and challenging. Tellurium (Te) is a promising alternative electrode due to its intrinsic attractive electronic conductivity and high theoretical volumetric capacity yet still to be explored. Herein, the kinetically/thermodynamically co&#8208;dominat copper&#8211;tellurium (Cu&#8211;Te) alloying phase&#8208;conversion process and corresponding oxidation failure mechanism of tellurium are investigated using in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and comprehensive ex situ characterization techniques. By virtue of the fundamental insights into the tellurium electrode, facile and precise electrolyte engineering (solvated structure modulation or reductive antioxidant addition) is implemented to essentially tackle the dramatic capacity loss in tellurium, affording reversible aqueous Cu&#8211;Te conversion reaction with an unprecedented ultrahigh volumetric capacity of up to 3927&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;3, a flat long discharge plateau (capacity proportion of &#8776;81%), and an extraordinary level of capacity retention of 80.4% over 2000 cycles at 20&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 of which lifespan thousand&#8208;fold longer than Cu&#8211;Te conversion using CuSO4&#8211;H2O electrolyte. This work paves a significant avenue for expanding high&#8208;performance conversion&#8208;type cathodes toward energetic aqueous multivalent&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Transparent Porous Conductive Substrates for Gas&#8208;Phase Photoelectrochemical Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transparent gas diffusion electrodes are developed via the F&#8208;doped SnO2 coating of SiO2 fused fiber felts. These highly porous and conductive substrates are amenable to the disposition of various semiconductors and are employed herein to demonstrate photoelectrode membrane assemblies for solar&#8208;driven H2 production in a gas&#8208;phase flow cell.








Abstract
Gas diffusion electrodes are essential components of common fuel and electrolysis cells but are typically made from graphitic carbon or metallic materials, which do not allow light transmittance and thus limit the development of gas&#8208;phase based photoelectrochemical devices. Herein, the simple and scalable preparation of F&#8208;doped SnO2 (FTO) coated SiO2 interconnected fiber felt substrates is reported. Using 2&#8211;5&#160;&#181;m diameter fibers at a loading of 4&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, the resulting substrates have porosity of 90%, roughness factor of 15.8, and Young's Modulus of 0.2&#160;GPa. A 100 nm conformal coating of FTO via atmospheric chemical vapor deposition gives sheet resistivity of 20 &#177; 3 &#937; sq&#8722;1 and loss of incident light of 41% at illumination wavelength of 550&#160;nm. The coating of various semiconductors on the substrates is established including Fe2O3 (chemical bath deposition), CuSCN and Cu2O (electrodeposition), and conjugated polymers (dip coating), and liquid&#8208;phase photoelectrochemical performance commensurate with flat FTO substrates is confirmed. Finally, gas phase H2 production is demonstrated with a polymer semiconductor photocathode membrane assembly at 1&#8208;Sun photocurrent density on the order of 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and Faradaic efficiency of 40%.

         <title>Bioengineering of High Cell Density Tissues with Hierarchical Vascular Networks for Ex Vivo Whole Organs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method is shown to fabricate an in vitro model of millimeter&#8208;sized scaffold&#8208;free tissues whose cell density is &#8776;200 million cells mL&#8722;1, corresponding to those of native tissues. The supply of oxygen and nutrition is extremely significant for such tissues. Therefore, a hierarchical vascular network containing capillaries and an artificial channel for perfusion are formed.








Abstract
The development of tissue&#8208;like structures such as cell sheets, spheroids, and organoids has contributed to progress in regenerative medicine. Simultaneous achievement of scale up and high cell density of these tissues is challenging because sufficient oxygen cannot be supplied to the inside of large, high cell density tissues. Here, in vitro fabrication of vessels to supply oxygen to the inside of millimeter&#8208;sized scaffold&#8208;free tissues whose cell density is &#8776;200 million cells mL&#8722;1, corresponding to those of native tissues, is shown. Hierarchical vascular networks by anastomosis of capillaries and a large vessel are essential for oxygen supply, whereas a large vessel or capillary networks alone make negligible contributions to the supply. The hierarchical vascular networks are formed by a top&#8208;down approach, which offers a new option for ex vivo whole organs without decellularization and 3D&#8208;bioprinting.

         <title>Optically Excited Lasing in a Cavity&#8208;Based, High&#8208;Current&#8208;Density Quantum Dot Electroluminescent Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;function colloidal quantum dot (QD) devices that operate as a high&#8208;current density light emitting diode and an optically excited laser are demonstrated. The device structure has been optimized to reduce optical losses and allow for efficient wave&#8208;guiding within the active QD layer. This demonstration represents an important milestone toward the practical implementation of a colloidal QD laser diode.








Abstract
Laser diodes based on solution&#8208;processable materials can benefit numerous technologies including integrated electronics and photonics, telecommunications, and medical diagnostics. An attractive system for implementing these devices is colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). The progress towards a QD laser diode has been hampered by rapid nonradiative Auger decay of optical&#8208;gain&#8208;active multicarrier states, fast device degradation at high current densities required for laser action, and unfavorable competition between optical gain and optical losses in a multicomponent device stack. Here&#160;we&#160;resolve some of these challenges and demonstrate optically excited lasing from fully functional high&#8208;current density electroluminescent (EL) devices with an integrated optical resonator. This advance has become possible due to excellent optical gain properties of continuously graded QDs and a refined device architecture, which allows for highly efficient light amplification in a thin, EL&#8208;active QD layer.

     alt="Optically Excited Lasing in a Cavity-Based, High-Current-Density Quantum Dot Electroluminescent Device"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dual-function colloidal quantum dot (QD) devices that operate as a high-current density light emitting diode and an optically excited laser are demonstrated. The device structure has been optimized to reduce optical losses and allow for efficient wave-guiding within the active QD layer. This demonstration represents an important milestone toward the practical implementation of a colloidal QD laser diode.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laser diodes based on solution-processable materials can benefit numerous technologies including integrated electronics and photonics, telecommunications, and medical diagnostics. An attractive system for implementing these devices is colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). The progress towards a QD laser diode has been hampered by rapid nonradiative Auger decay of optical-gain-active multicarrier states, fast device degradation at high current densities required for laser action, and unfavorable competition between optical gain and optical losses in a multicomponent device stack. Here&#160;we&#160;resolve some of these challenges and demonstrate optically excited lasing from fully functional high-current density electroluminescent (EL) devices with an integrated optical resonator. This advance has become possible due to excellent optical gain properties of continuously graded QDs and a refined device architecture, which allows for highly efficient light amplification in a thin, EL-active QD layer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Monolithic Tandem Vertical Electrochemical Transistors for Printed Multi&#8208;Valued Logic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design of high&#8208;speed electrochemical ternary logic transistor is presented. A vertically stacked dual channel heterostructure enables a clear manifestation of multiple logic states in 1&#160;V input&#8211;output voltage ranges, through a simple chemical&#8208;tuning of semiconductor materials.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have recently emerged as a feasible candidate to realize the next generation of printable electronics. Especially, their chemical versatility and the unique redox&#8208;based operating principle have provided new possibilities in high&#8208;functioning logic circuitry beyond the traditional binary Boolean logic. Here, a simple strategy to electrochemically realize monolithic multi&#8208;valued logic transistors is presented, which is one of the most promising branches of transistor technology in the forthcoming era of hyper Moore's law. A vertically stacked heterogeneous dual&#8208;channel architecture is introduced with a patterned reference electrode, which enables a facile manifestation of stable and equiprobable ternary logic states with a reduced transistor footprint. The dual&#8208;ion&#8208;penetration mechanism coupled with ultrashort vertical channel even allows a very&#8208;high accessing frequency to multiple logic states reaching over 10&#160;MHz. Furthermore, printed arrays of ternary logic gates with full voltage swing within 1&#160;V are demonstrated.

         <title>Fast and Durable Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction at the Electron&#8208;Deficient Ruthenium&#8211;Ruthenium Oxide Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ru/RuO2 in&#8208;plane heterostructure is designed as an efficient electrocatalyst toward the alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). The interfacial Ru and RuO2 domains are the optimal H and OH adsorption sites, respectively. The Ru domains are electron deficient and show substantially improved inoxidizability. The results highlight the significance of establishing robust and multifunctional heterointerfaces toward fast alkaline HOR and beyond.








Abstract
The slow hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics under alkaline conditions remain a critical challenge for the practical application of alkaline exchange membrane fuel cells. Herein, Ru/RuO2 in&#8208;plane heterostructures are designed with abundant active Ru&#8211;RuO2 interface domains as efficient electrocatalysts for the HOR in alkaline media. The experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that interfacial Ru and RuO2 domains at Ru&#8211;RuO2 interfaces are the optimal H and OH adsorption sites, respectively, endowing the well&#8208;defined Ru(100)/RuO2(200) interface as the preferential region for fast alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis. More importantly, the metallic Ru domains become electron deficient due to the strong interaction with RuO2 domains and show substantially improved inoxidizability, which is vital to maintain durable HOR electrocatalytic activity. The optimal Ru/RuO2 heterostructured electrocatalyst exhibits impressive alkaline HOR activity with an exchange current density of 8.86&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and decent durability. The exceptional electrocatalytic performance of Ru/RuO2 in&#8208;plane heterostructure can be attributed to the robust and multifunctional Ru&#8211;RuO2 interfaces endowed by the unique metal&#8211;metal oxide domains.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme with Asymmetric Electron Distribution for Tumor Catalytic Therapy by Disrupting Tumor Redox and Energy Metabolism Homeostasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the drawbacks of current nanozyme catalytic therapy, a novel Ir&#63743;N5 single&#8208;atom/Cer nanoagent with asymmetric electron distribution is developed, which can improve the efficiency of multienzyme&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions through a substrate&#8208;recyclable manner, thereby disrupting the intracellular redox and energy metabolism homeostasis to achieve efficient tumor therapy.








Abstract
Nanozyme catalytic therapy triggered by tumor&#8208;specific endogenous stimuli is an emerging tumor therapy that attracts wide attention. However, the current therapeutic efficacy of nanozyme catalytic therapy is severely limited by the catalytic efficiency of nanozymes and the concentration of endogenous reaction substrates. Herein, a novel and efficient Ir&#63743;N5 single&#8208;atom (Ir&#63743;N5 SA) nanozyme is developed with multiple enzyme&#8208;like catalytic activities. Due to the synergistic effect of central Ir single&#8208;atom and axial N coordination, Ir&#63743;N5 SA exhibits better enzymatic catalytic performance than Ir&#63743;N4 SA. At tumor sites, Ir&#63743;N5 SA can generate a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through oxidase (OXD)&#8208;like and peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like catalytic activities. Moreover, Ir&#63743;N5 SA can also generate O2 and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through catalase (CAT)&#8208;like and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) oxidase (NOX)&#8208;like catalytic activities, realizing the efficient nanozyme catalytic therapy in a substrate&#8208;cycle manner. Additionally, Ir&#63743;N5 SA can effectively break the intracellular NADH/NAD+ cycle balance by mimicking NOX, and then cooperate with fatty acid synthase cerulenin (Cer) to interfere with the energy metabolism homeostasis of tumor cells. Consequently, the designed Ir&#63743;N5 SA/Cer nanoagent can disrupt redox and metabolic homeostasis in the tumor region through an enzyme&#8208;mimicking cascade reaction, effectively overcoming the shortcomings of current nanozyme catalytic therapy.

         <title>Unraveling the Plasma Protein Corona by Ultrasonic Cavitation Augments Active&#8208;Transporting of Liposome in Solid Tumor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transcytosis&#8208;targeting peptide&#8208;decorated reconfigurable liposome (LPGL) is capable of ultrasound&#8208;induced liposomal reassembly and protein&#8208;corona decortication. Ultrasound irradiation induces size&#8208;transformation of the LPGL and decorticates the surface protein corona by lipid membrane reassembly, whereby the capability to recognize the receptors on tumor neovascularization is regained, ligand/receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis is initiated, and efficient tumor accumulation and penetration is achieved, leading to potent antitumor activity.








Abstract
Ligand/receptor&#8208;mediated targeted drug delivery has been widely recognized as a promising strategy for improving the clinical efficacy of&#160;nanomedicines but is attenuated by the binding of plasma protein on the surface of nanoparticles to form a protein corona. Here, it is shown that ultrasonic cavitation can be used to unravel surface plasma coronas on liposomal nanoparticles through ultrasound (US)&#8208;induced liposomal reassembly. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the method, transcytosis&#8208;targeting&#8208;peptide&#8208;decorated reconfigurable liposomes (LPGLs) loaded with gemcitabine (GEM) and perfluoropentane (PFP) are developed for cancer&#8208;targeted therapy. In the blood circulation, the targeting peptides are deactivated by the plasma corona and lose their targeting capability. Once they reach tumor blood vessels, US irradiation induces transformation of the LPGLs from nanodrops into microbubbles via liquid&#8211;gas phase transition and decorticate the surface corona by reassembly of the lipid membrane. The activated liposomes regain the capability to recognize the receptors on tumor neovascularization, initiate ligand/receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis, achieve efficient tumor accumulation and penetration, and lead to potent antitumor activity in multiple tumor models of patient&#8208;derived tumor xenografts. This study presents an effective strategy to tackle the fluid biological barriers of the protein corona and develop transcytosis&#8208;targeting liposomes for active tumor transport and efficient cancer therapy.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative self&#8208;powered room&#8208;temperature nitrogen dioxide (NO2) sensor based on an indium phosphide homojunction nanowire array is presented. The proof&#8208;to&#8208;concept sensor structure, with high sensitivity, stability, and selectivity, is demonstrated. It is integrated to&#160;a USB interface for on&#8208;field vehicle&#8208;exhaust measurement. This work promises a new family of self&#8208;powered sensors made of III&#8211;V compound semiconductor nanostructures, for future mega&#8208;scale Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things systems.








Abstract
The fast development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has driven an increasing consumer demand for self&#8208;powered gas sensors for real&#8208;time data collection and autonomous responses in industries such as environmental monitoring, workplace safety, smart cities, and personal healthcare. Despite intensive research and rapid progress in the field, most reported self&#8208;powered devices, specifically NO2 sensors for air pollution monitoring, have limited sensitivity, selectivity, and scalability. Here, a novel photovoltaic self&#8208;powered NO2 sensor is demonstrated based on axial p&#8211;i&#8211;n homojunction InP nanowire (NW) arrays, that overcome these limitations. The optimized innovative InP NW array device is designed by numerical simulation for insights into sensing mechanisms and performance enhancement. Without a power source, this InP NW sensor achieves an 84% sensing response to 1&#160;ppm NO2 and records a limit of detection down to the sub&#8208;ppb level, with little dependence on the incident light intensity, even under &lt;5% of 1 sun illumination. Based on this great environmental fidelity, the sensor is integrated into a commercial microchip interface to evaluate its performance in the context of dynamic environmental monitoring of motor vehicle exhaust. The results show that compound semiconductor nanowires can form promising self&#8208;powered sensing platforms suitable for future mega&#8208;scale IoT systems.

         <title>Tuning the Color of Photonic Glass Pigments by Thermal Annealing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermal annealing of porous bottlebrush block copolymer microparticles enables their coloration to be tuned from blue through to red, without significant loss of structural fidelity. This process is driven by both a temperature&#8208;induced softening of the polymer matrix and the absence of microphase separation. Applying thermal annealing as a post&#8208;process enables the production of thermochromic patterned hydrogels.








Abstract
Thermal or solvent annealing is commonly employed to enhance phase separation and remove defects in block copolymer (BCP) films, leading to well&#8208;resolved nanostructures. Annealing is of particular importance for photonic BCP materials, where large, well&#8208;ordered lamellar domains are required to generate strong reflections at visible wavelengths. However, such strategies have not been considered for porous BCP systems, such as inverse photonic glasses, where the structure (and thus the optical response) is no longer defined solely by the chemical compatibility of the blocks, but by the size and arrangement of voids within the BCP matrix. In this study, a demonstration of how the concept of &#8220;thermal annealing&#8221; can be applied to bottlebrush block copolymer (BBCP) microparticles with a photonic glass architecture is presented, enabling their coloration to be tuned from blue to red. By comparing biocompatible BBCPs with similar composition, but different thermal behavior, it is shown that this process is driven by both a temperature&#8208;induced softening of the BBCP matrix (i.e., polymer mobility) and the absence of microphase separation (enabling diffusion&#8208;induced swelling of the pores). Last, this concept is applied toward the production of a thermochromic patterned hydrogel, exemplifying the potential of such responsive biocompatible photonic&#8208;glass pigments toward smart labeling or anticounterfeiting applications.

         <title>Construction of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Films via Crosslinking&#8208;Induced Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small clusters in the early growth steps of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can be stabilized by modulators to form fluidic precursors (denoted as preMOFs) with good processibility. Then, the removal of solvents and modulators will trigger the crosslinking of preMOFs and lead to the formation of continuous MOF films.








Abstract
The construction of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films is a crucial step for integrating them into technical applications. However, due to the crystallization nature, it is difficult to grow most MOFs spontaneously or process them into films. Here, a convenient strategy is demonstrated for constructing MOF films by using modulators to achieve homogeneous assembly of MOF clusters. Small clusters in the early growth steps of MOFs can be stabilized by modulators to form fluidic precursors with good processibility. Then, simple removal of modulators will trigger the crosslinking of MOF clusters and lead to the formation of continuous films. This strategy is universal for the fabrication of several types of MOF films with large scale and controllable thickness, which can be deposited on a variety of substrates as well as can be patterned in micro/nano resolution. Additionally, versatile composite MOF films can be easily synthesized by introducing functional materials during the crosslinking process, which brings them broader application prospects.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency and Mechanically Robust All&#8208;Polymer Organic Photovoltaic Cells Enabled by Optimized Fibril Network Morphology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By synthesizing a high weight&#8208;average molecular weight polymer donor PBDB&#8208;TF and combining a ternary blending strategy, favorable phase separation morphology featuring more compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance can be attained. A maximum power conversion efficiency of 18.2% (certified value of 17.7%) with excellent mechanical properties in all&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaic cells is demonstrated.








Abstract
All&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells possessing high photovoltaic performance and mechanical robustness are promising candidates for flexible wearable devices. However, developing photoactive materials with good mechanical properties and photovoltaic performance so far remains challenging. In this work, a polymer donor PBDB&#8208;TF with a high weight&#8208;average molecular weight (Mw) is introduced to enable highly efficient all&#8208;polymer OPV cells featuring excellent mechanical reliability. By incorporating the high&#8208;Mw PBDB&#8208;TF as a third component into the PBQx&#8208;TF:PY&#8208;IT blend, the bulk heterojunction morphology is finely tuned with a more compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance, affording efficient pathways for charge transport as well as mechanical stress dissipation. Hence, all&#8208;polymer OPV cells based on the ternary blend film demonstrate a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.2% with an outstanding fill factor of 0.796. The flexible OPV cell delivers a decent PCE of 16.5% with high mechanical stability. These results present a promising strategy to address the mechanical properties and boost the photovoltaic performance of all&#8208;polymer OPV cells.

         <title>Fullerene&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Crystal&#8208;Induced Micrometer&#8208;Scale Charge&#8208;Carrier Diffusion in Organic Bulk Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;mobility fullerene liquid crystal is introduced into the active layer of organic solar cells (OSCs) to provide a fast channel for charge&#8208;carrier transport, reduce energetic disorder and trap density via enhancing crystallization, and then realize micrometer&#8208;scale charge&#8208;carrier diffusion, leading to the impressive power conversion efficiencies of 15.23% for OSCs with the thickness approaching 500 nm.








Abstract
The short charge&#8208;carrier diffusion length (LD) (100&#8211;300&#160;nm) in organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) impedes the further improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs), especially for thick&#8208;film (&gt;400&#160;nm) devices matching with industrial solution processing. Here a facile method is developed to efficiently increase LD and then improve PCEs of OSCs via introducing a fullerene liquid crystal, F1, into the active layer. F1 combines the inherent high electron mobility of fullerene and strong self&#8208;assembly capacity of liquid crystal, providing a fast channel for charge&#8208;carrier transport&#160;and reducing energetic disorder and trap density in BHJ film via enhancing crystallization. Typically, in PM6:Y6:F1 BHJ, the enhanced charge&#8208;carrier mobility (&gt;10&#8722;2 cm&#8722;2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and prolonged charge&#8208;carrier lifetime (55.3 &#181;s) are acquired to realize the record LD of 1.6 or 2.4&#160;&#181;m for electron or hole, respectively, which are much higher than those of the PM6:Y6 binary sample and comparable to or even better than those values reported for some inorganic/hybrid materials, such as CuInxGa(1&#8722;x)Se2 (CIGS) and perovskite thin films. Benefitting from the micrometer&#8208;scale LD, the PM6:Y6:F1 ternary OSCs sustain a remarkable PCE of 15.23% with the active layer thickness approaching 500&#160;nm.

Typically, in PM6:Y6:F1 BHJ, the enhanced charge-carrier mobility (&amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and prolonged charge-carrier lifetime (55.3 &#181;s) are acquired to realize the record &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; of 1.6 or 2.4&#160;&#181;m for electron or hole, respectively, which are much higher than those of the PM6:Y6 binary sample and comparable to or even better than those values reported for some inorganic/hybrid materials, such as CuIn&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;(1&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;)&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (CIGS) and perovskite thin films. Benefitting from the micrometer-scale &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;, the PM6:Y6:F1 ternary OSCs sustain a remarkable PCE of 15.23% with the active layer thickness approaching 500&#160;nm.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
