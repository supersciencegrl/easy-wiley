         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Materials in Droplet Manipulation for Biochemical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Miniaturized droplets, characterized by well&#8208;controlled microenvironments and capability for parallel processing, have significantly advanced the studies on enzymatic evolution, molecular diagnostics, and single&#8208;cell analysis. However, manipulation of small&#8208;sized droplets, including moving, merging, and trapping of the targeted droplets for complex biochemical assays and subsequent analysis, is not trivial and remains technically demanding. Among various techniques, light&#8208;driven methods stand out as a promising candidate for droplet manipulation in a facile and flexible manner, given the features of contactless interaction, high spatiotemporal resolution, and biocompatibility. This review therefore compiles an in&#8208;depth discussion of the governing mechanisms underpinning light&#8208;driven droplet manipulation. Besides, light&#8208;responsive materials, representing the core of light&#8208;matter interaction and the key character converting light into different forms of energy, are particularly assessed in this review. Recent advancements in light&#8208;responsive materials and the most notable applications are comprehensively archived and evaluated. Continuous innovations and rational engineering of light&#8208;responsive materials are expected to propel the development of light&#8208;driven droplet manipulation, equip droplets with enhanced functionality, and broaden the applications of droplets for biochemical studies and routine biochemical investigations.

         <title>22% Record Efficiency in Nanorod Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Achieved by Gradient Shells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) based on isotropic quantum dots has approached the theoretical limit of close to 20%. Anisotropic nanorods can break this limit by taking advantage of their directional emission. However, the progress towards higher EQE by using CdSe/CdS nanorods (NRs) faces several challenges, primarily involving the low quantum yield and unbalanced charge injection in devices. Herein, we modified the seeded growth method and obtained anisotropic nanorods with PLQY up to 98% by coating a gradient alloyed CdZnSe shell around conventional spherical CdSe seeds. This intermediate alloyed CdZnSe shell combined with a subsequent rod&#8208;shaped CdZnS/ZnS shell can effectively suppress the electron delocalization in the typical CdSe/CdS nanorods due to their small conduction bandgap offset. Additionally, this alloyed shell can reduce the hole&#8208;injection barrier and create a larger barrier for electron injection, both effects promoting a balanced injection of electrons and holes in LEDs. Hence, we reached LEDs with high brightness (160341&#160;cd/m2) and high efficiency (EQE = 22%, current efficiency = 23.19&#160;cd/A), which are the highest values to date for nanorod LEDs.

         <title>Regulating d&#8208;Orbital Hybridization of Subgroup&#8208;IVB Single Atoms for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Highly active single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction are crucial for improving the energy conversion efficiency, but they suffer from a limited choice of metal centers and unsatisfactory stabilities. Here we report that optimization of the binding energies for reaction intermediates by tuning the d&#8208;orbital hybridization with axial groups converts inactive subgroup&#8208;IVB (Ti, Zr, Hf) moieties (MN4) into active motifs (MN4O), as confirmed with theoretical calculations. The competition between metal&#8208;ligand covalency and metal&#8208;intermediate covalency affects the d&#8208;p orbital hybridization between the metal site and the intermediates, converting the metal centres into active sites. Subsequently, dispersed single&#8208;atom M sites coordinated by nitrogen/oxygen groups have been prepared on graphene (s&#8208;M&#8208;N/O&#8208;C) catalysts on a large&#8208;scale with high&#8208;energy milling and pyrolysis. Impressively, the s&#8208;Hf&#8208;N/O&#8208;C catalyst with 5.08&#160;wt.% Hf exhibited a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.920&#160;V and encouraging performance in a zinc&#8208;air battery with an extraordinary cycling life of over 1,600&#160;h and a large peak power&#8208;density of 256.9&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. This work provides promising single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts and principles for preparing other catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction.

         <title>From Synthesis to Mechanisms: In&#8208;Depth Exploration of the Dual&#8208;Atom Catalytic Mechanisms Toward Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) hold a higher metal atom loading and provide greater flexibility in terms of the structural characteristics of their active sites in comparison to SACs. Consequently, DACs hold great promise for achieving improved catalytic performance. This article aims to provide a focused overview of the latest advancements in DACs, covering their synthesis and mechanisms in reversible oxygen electrocatalysis, which plays a key role in sustainable energy conversion and storage technologies. The discussion starts by highlighting the structures of DACs and the differences in diatomic coordination induced by various substrates. Subsequently, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art fabrication strategies of DACs for oxygen electrocatalysis are discussed from several different perspectives. It particularly highlights the challenges of increasing the diatomic loading capacity. More importantly, the main focus of this overview is to investigate the correlation between the configuration and activity in DACs in order to gain a deeper understanding of their active roles in oxygen electrocatalysis. This will be achieved through density functional theory (DFT) calculations and sophisticated in situ characterization technologies. The aim is to provide guidelines for optimizing and upgrading DACs in oxygen electrocatalysis. Additionally, the overview discusses the current challenges and future prospects in this rapidly evolving area of research.

         <title>Stainless Steel Activation for Efficient Alkaline Oxygen Evolution in Advanced Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Designing robust and cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts for efficient alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of great significance in the field of water electrolysis. In this study, we introduce an electrochemical strategy to activate stainless steel (SS) electrodes for efficient OER. By&#160;cycling the SS electrode within a potential window that encompasses the Fe(II)&#8596;Fe(III) process, we can greatly enhance its OER activity compared to using a potential window that excludes this redox reaction, decreasing the overpotential at current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 by 40&#160;mV. Electrochemical characterization, Inductively Coupled Plasma &#8211; Optical Emission Spectroscopy and operando Raman measurements demonstrated that the Fe leaching at the SS surface can be accelerated through a Fe &#8594; &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 &#8594; Fe3O4 or FeO &#8594; Fe2+ (aq.) conversion process, leading to the sustained exposure of Cr and Ni species. While Cr leaching occurs during its oxidation process, Ni species display higher resistance to leaching and gradually accumulate on the SS surface in the form of OER&#8208;active Fe&#8208;incorporated NiOOH species. Furthermore, a potential&#8208;pulse strategy was also introduced to regenerate the OER&#8208;activity of 316&#8208;type SS for stable OER, both in the three&#8208;electrode configuration (without performance decay after 300&#160;h at 350&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and in an alkaline water electrolyzer (ca. 30&#160;mV cell voltage increase after accelerated stress test&#8208;AST). The AST&#8208;stabilized cell can still reach 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 4000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at cell voltages of 1.69&#160;V and 2.1&#160;V, which makes it competitive with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrolyzers based on ion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membranes using Ir&#8208;based anodes.

Abstract
The construction of high&#8208;quality carbon&#8208;based energy materials through biotechnology has always been an eager goal of the scientific community. Herein, we first report juice vesicles bioreactors (JVBs) bio&#8208;technology based on hesperidium (e.g., pomelo, waxberry, oranges) for preparation of carbon&#8208;based composites with controllable components, adjustable morphologies, and sizes. JVBs serve as miniature reaction vessels that enable sophisticated confined chemical reactions to take place, ultimately resulting in the formations of complex carbon composites. The newly developed approach is highly versatile and can be compatible with a wide range of materials including metals, alloys, and metal compounds. The growth and self&#8208;assembly mechanisms of carbon composites via JVBs are explained. For illustration, NiCo alloy nanoparticles are successfully in&#8208;situ implanted into pomelo vesicles cross&#8208;linked carbon (PCC) by JVBs, and their applications as sulfur/carbon cathodes for lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries are explored. The well&#8208;designed PCC/NiCo&#8208;S electrode exhibits superior high&#8208;rate properties and enhanced long&#8208;term stability. Synergistic reinforcement mechanisms on transportation of ions/electrons of interface reactions and catalytic conversion of lithium polysulfides arising from metal alloy and carbon architecture are proposed with the aid of DFT calculations. Our research provides a novel biosynthetic route to rational design and fabrication of carbon composites for advanced energy storage.

         <title>Engineering and Targeting Neutrophils for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent advances in engineering neutrophils and their derivatives as drug delivery carriers for enhanced tumor targeting and improved therapeutic efficacy. Targeting neutrophils for remodeling tumor microenvironment (TME) and reinvigorating anti&#8208;tumor immunity provide a broad understanding of the potential application of neutrophils in cancer therapy.








Abstract
Neutrophils are the most abundant white blood cells in the circulation and act as the first line of defense against infections. Increasing evidence suggests that neutrophils possess heterogeneous phenotypes and functional plasticity in human health and diseases, including cancer. Neutrophils play multifaceted roles in cancer development and progression, and an N1/N2 paradigm of neutrophils in cancer is proposed, where N1 neutrophils exert anti&#8208;tumor properties while N2 neutrophils display tumor&#8208;supportive and immune&#8208;suppressive functions. Selective activation of beneficial neutrophil population and targeted inhibition or re&#8208;polarization of tumor&#8208;promoting neutrophils has shown an important potential in tumor therapy. In addition, due to the natural inflammation&#8208;responsive and physical barrier&#8208;crossing abilities, neutrophils and their derivatives (membranes and extracellular vesicles (EVs)) are regarded as advanced drug delivery carriers for enhanced tumor targeting and improved therapeutic efficacy. In this review, the recent advances in engineering neutrophils for drug delivery and targeting neutrophils for remodeling tumor microenvironment (TME) are comprehensively presented. This review will provide a broad understanding of the potential of neutrophils in cancer therapy.

         <title>Earthworm&#8208;Inspired Co/Co3O4/CoF2@NSC Nanofibrous Electrocatalyst with Confined Channels for Enhanced ORR/OER Performance</title>

Abstract
The rational construction of highly active and durable oxygen&#8208;reactive electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) plays a critical role in rechargeable metal&#8208;air batteries. It is pivotal to achieve optimal utilization of electrocatalytically active sites and valid control of the high specific internal surface area. Inspiration for designing electrocatalysts can come from nature, as it is full of precisely manipulated and highly efficient structures. Herein, inspired by earthworms fertilizing soil, a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) carbon nanofibrous electrocatalyst with multiple interconnected nanoconfined channels, cobalt&#8208;based heterojunction active particles and enriched N, S heteroatoms (Co/Co3O4/CoF2@NSC with confined channels) is rationally designed, showing superior bifunctional electrocatalytic activity in alkaline electrolyte, even outperforming that of benchmark Pt/C&#8208;RuO2 catalyst. This work demonstrates a new method for porous structural regulation, in which the internal confined channels within the nanofibers are controllably formed by the spontaneous migration of cobalt&#8208;based nanoparticles under a CO2 atmosphere. Theoretical analysis reveals that constructing Co/Co3O4/CoF2@NSC electrocatalyst with confined channels can greatly adjust the electron distribution, effectively lower the reaction barrier of inter&#8208;mediate and reduce the OER/ORR overpotential. This work introduces a novel and nature&#8208;inspired strategy for designing efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts with well&#8208;designed architectures.

         <title>Liquid Metal loaded Molecular Sieve: Specialized Lithium Dendrite Blocking Filler for Polymeric Solid&#8208;state Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are currently one of the best candidates for realizing the yearning high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries with high safety. However, even polyethylene oxide (PEO), the most popular polymeric solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) with the largest ionic conductivity in the category so far, has significant challenges due to the safety issues of lithium dendrites, and the insufficient ionic conductivity. Herein, molecular sieve (MS) was integrated into the PEO as an inert filler with the liquid metal (LM) as a functional module, forming an &#8220;LM&#8208;MS&#8208;PEO&#8221; composite as both SSE with enhanced ionic conductivity, and protection layer against lithium dendrites. As demonstrated by theoretical and experimental investigations, LM released from MS can be uniformly and efficiently distributed in PEO, which could avoid agglomeration, enables the effective blocking of lithium dendrites, and regulate the mass transport of Li ions, thus achieving even deposition of lithium during charge/discharge. Moreover, MS could reduce the crystallinity of PEO, improve lithium&#8208;ion conductivity, and reduce operating temperature. Benefiting from the introduction of the functional MS/LM, the LM&#8208;MS&#8208;PEO electrolyte exhibits four&#8208;fold higher lithium ionic conductivity than the pristine PEO at 40&#160;&#176;C, while the as&#8208;assembled all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LMBs have four to five times longer stable cycle life.

         <title>Structuring Cu Membrane Electrode for Maximizing Ethylene Yield from CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrocatalytic ethylene (C2H4) evolution from CO2 reduction is an intriguing route to mitigate both the energy and environmental crises; however, to acquire industrially relevant high productivity and selectivity at low energy cost remains to be challenging. Membrane assembly electrode (MEA) has shown great prospect and tailoring its architecture for maximizing C2H4 yield at minimum voltage with long&#8208;term stability becomes critical. Here a freestanding Cu membrane cathode is designed and constructed by electrochemically depositing mesoporous Cu film on Cu foam to simultaneously manage CO2, electron, water and product transport, which shows an extraordinary C2H4 Faradaic efficiency of 85.6% with a full cell power conversion efficiency of 33% at a current density of 368&#160;mA/cm2, heading the techno&#8208;economic viability for electrocatalytic C2H4 production.

         <title>Ferredoxin&#8208;Inspired Design of S&#8208;Synergized Fe&#8211;Fe Dual&#8208;Metal Center Catalysts for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, iron&#8208;based dual&#8208;metal center catalysts are strategically designed and fabricated by mimicking ferredoxin, in which additional Fe and S sites are synchronously installed near the single Fe sites as the &#8220;dual modulators&#8221; for precise modulation of the electronic structure. Thereby, balancing the adsorption/desorption behavior of the reaction intermediates, and accelerating the overall reaction kinetics.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;metal center catalysts (DMCs) have shown the ability to enhance the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) owing to their distinctive structural configurations. However, the precise modulation of electronic structure and the in&#8208;depth understanding of synergistic mechanisms between dual metal sites of DMCs at the atomic level remain challenging. Herein, mimicking the ferredoxin, Fe&#8208;based DMCs (Fe2N6&#8208;S) are strategically designed and fabricated, in which additional Fe and S sites are synchronously installed near the Fe sites and serve as &#8220;dual modulators&#8221; for coarse&#8208; and fine&#8208;tuning of the electronic modulation, respectively. The as&#8208;prepared Fe2N6&#8208;S catalyst exhibits enhanced ORR activity and outstanding Zinc&#8208;air (Zn&#8211;air) battery performance compared to the conventional single Fe site catalysts. The theoretical and experimental results reveal that introducing the second metal Fe creates a dual adsorption site that alters the O2 adsorption configuration and effectively activates the O&#9472;O bond, while the synergistic effect of dual Fe sites results in the downward shift of the d&#8208;band center, facilitating the release of OH*. Additionally, local electronic engineering of heteroatom S for Fe sites further facilitates the formation of the rate&#8208;determining step OOH*, thus accelerating the reaction kinetics.

     alt="Ferredoxin-Inspired Design of S-Synergized Fe&#8211;Fe Dual-Metal Center Catalysts for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction Reaction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, iron-based dual-metal center catalysts are strategically designed and fabricated by mimicking ferredoxin, in which additional Fe and S sites are synchronously installed near the single Fe sites as the &#8220;dual modulators&#8221; for precise modulation of the electronic structure. Thereby, balancing the adsorption/desorption behavior of the reaction intermediates, and accelerating the overall reaction kinetics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dual-metal center catalysts (DMCs) have shown the ability to enhance the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) owing to their distinctive structural configurations. However, the precise modulation of electronic structure and the in-depth understanding of synergistic mechanisms between dual metal sites of DMCs at the atomic level remain challenging. Herein, mimicking the ferredoxin, Fe-based DMCs (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-S) are strategically designed and fabricated, in which additional Fe and S sites are synchronously installed near the Fe sites and serve as &#8220;dual modulators&#8221; for coarse- and fine-tuning of the electronic modulation, respectively. The as-prepared Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-S catalyst exhibits enhanced ORR activity and outstanding Zinc-air (Zn&#8211;air) battery performance compared to the conventional single Fe site catalysts. The theoretical and experimental results reveal that introducing the second metal Fe creates a dual adsorption site that alters the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption configuration and effectively activates the O&#9472;O bond, while the synergistic effect of dual Fe sites results in the downward shift of the d-band center, facilitating the release of OH*. Additionally, local electronic engineering of heteroatom S for Fe sites further facilitates the formation of the rate-determining step OOH*, thus accelerating the reaction kinetics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
In recent years, tremendous effort has been devoted to developing platforms, such as implantable drug delivery systems (IDDSs), with temporally and spatially controlled drug release capabilities and improved adherence. IDDSs have multiple advantages: i) the timing and location of drug delivery can be controlled by patients using specific stimuli (light, sound, electricity, magnetism, etc.). Some intelligent &#8220;closed&#8208;loop&#8221; IDDS can even realize self&#8208;management without human participation. ii) IDDSs enable continuous and stable delivery of drugs over a long period (months to years) and iii) to administer drugs directly to the lesion, thereby help reduce dosage and side effects. iv) IDDSs enable personalized drug delivery according to patient needs. The high demand for such systems has prompted scientists to make efforts to develop intelligent IDDS. In this review, we detail several common stimulus&#8208;responsive mechanisms including endogenous (e.g., pH, reactive oxygen species, proteins, etc.) and exogenous stimuli (e.g., light, sound, electricity, magnetism, etc.). Besides, several types of IDDS reported in recent years are reviewed, including various stimulus&#8208;responsive systems based on the above mechanisms, radio frequency&#8208;controlled IDDS, &#8220;closed&#8208;loop&#8221; IDDS, self&#8208;powered IDDS, etc. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of various IDDS, bottleneck problems, and possible solutions are analyzed to provide directions for subsequent research.

         <title>Transformable Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembled Peptides for Cascade Self&#8208;Enhanced Ferroptosis Primed Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a a smart supramolecular self&#8208;assembled peptide TEP&#8208;FFG&#8208;CRApY for prostate cancer (PCa) immunotherapy. At tumor cells, TEP&#8208;FFG&#8208;CRApY initiates tumor cell cascade self&#8208;enhanced immunogenic ferroptosis via enzyme&#8208;triggered morphological transformation. The powerful immunomodulatory effect not only stimulates a solid antitumor immune response to suppress the primary tumor, but also creates a long&#8208;term immune memory to prevent tumor metastasis.








Abstract
Immunotherapy has received widespread attention for its effective and long&#8208;term tumor&#8208;eliminating ability. However, for immunogenic &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors, such as prostate cancer (PCa), the low immunogenicity of the tumor itself is a serious obstacle to efficacy. Here, this work reports a strategy to enhance PCa immunogenicity by triggering cascade self&#8208;enhanced ferroptosis in tumor cells, turning the tumor from &#8220;cold&#8221; to &#8220;hot&#8221;. This work develops a transformable self&#8208;assembled peptide TEP&#8208;FFG&#8208;CRApY with alkaline phosphatase (ALP) responsiveness and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) protein targeting. TEP&#8208;FFG&#8208;CRApY self&#8208;assembles into nanoparticles under aqueous conditions and transforms into nanofibers in response to ALP during endosome/lysosome uptake into tumor cells, promoting lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP). On the one hand, the released TEP&#8208;FFG&#8208;CRAY nanofibers target GPX4 and selectively degrade the GPX4 protein under the light irradiation, inducing ferroptosis; on the other hand, the large amount of leaked Fe2+ further cascade to amplify the ferroptosis through the Fenton reaction. TEP&#8208;FFG&#8208;CRApY&#8208;induced immunogenic ferroptosis improves tumor cell immunogenicity by promoting the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and increasing intratumor T&#8208;cell infiltration. More importantly, recovered T cells further enhance ferroptosis by secreting large amounts of interferon&#8208;gamma (IFN&#8208;&#947;). This work provides a novel strategy for the molecular design of synergistic molecularly targeted therapy for immunogenic &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Protection Inorganic&#8208;Protein Coating on Mg&#8208;Based Biomaterials through Tooth&#8208;Enamel&#8208;Inspired Biomineralization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel tooth&#8208;enamel&#8208;inspired inorganic&#8208;protein (inorganicPro) coating for Mg&#8208;based biomaterials is developed featuring effective dual&#8208;protection&#8212;anticorrosion and antifouling. The dual&#8208;protection originates from the bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein&#8208;involved biomineralization that alters reaction kinetics to create a dense &#8220;Brick&#8211;Mortar&#8221; structure and establish a BSA layer with low interfacial interactions, ensuring high compactness of coating and exceptional antifouling capabilities.








Abstract
Biocompatible magnesium alloys represent revolutionary implantable materials in dentistry and orthopedics but face challenges due to rapid biocorrosion, necessitating protective coatings to mitigate dysfunction. Directly integrating durable protective coatings onto Mg surfaces is challenging because of intrinsic low coating compactness. Herein, inspired by tooth enamel, a novel highly compact dual&#8208;protection inorganic&#8208;protein (inorganicPro) coating is in situ constructed on Mg surfaces through bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein&#8208;boosted reaction between sodium fluoride (NaF) and Mg substrates. The association of Mg ions and BSA establishes a local hydrophobic domain that lowers the formation enthalpy of NaMgF3 nanoparticles. This process generates finer nanoparticles that function as &#8220;bricks,&#8221; facilitating denser packing, consequently reducing voidage inside coatings by over 50% and reinforcing mechanical durability. Moreover, the incorporation of BSA in and on the coatings plays two synergistic roles: 1) acting as &#8220;mortar&#8221; to seal residual cracks within coatings, thereby promoting coating compactness and tripling anticorrosion performance, and 2) mitigating fouling&#8208;accelerated biocorrosion in complex biosystems via tenfold resistance against biofoulant attachments, including biofluids, proteins, and metabolites. This innovative strategy, leveraging proteins to alter inorganic reactions, benefits the future coating design for Mg&#8208;based and other metallic materials with tailored anticorrosion and antifouling performances.

         <title>Seamless Integration of Rapid Separation and Ultrasensitive Detection for Complex Biological Samples Using Multistage Annular Functionalized Carbon Nanotube Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multistage annular functionalized carbon nanotube arrays device is developed for aptamers surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering sandwich bacterial detection, which integrate both separation and detection processes to significantly reduce the overall time required for instantaneous detection. This device can quickly process complex biological samples with large volumes and achieve on&#8208;site, multimarker quantitative detection with high sensitivity.








Abstract
Efficient separation, enrichment, and detection of bacteria in diverse media are pivotal for identifying bacterial diseases and their transmission pathways. However, conventional bacterial detection methods that split the separation and detection steps are plagued by prolonged processing times. Herein, a multistage annular functionalized carbon nanotube array device designed for the seamless integration of complex biological sample separation and multimarker detection is introduced. This device resorts to the supersmooth fluidity of the liquid sample in the carbon nanotubes interstice through rotation assistance, achieving the ability to quickly separate impurities and capture biomarkers (1&#160;mL sample cost time of 2.5 s). Fluid dynamics simulations show that the reduction of near&#8208;surface hydrodynamic resistance drives the capture of bacteria and related biomarkers on the functionalized surface of carbon nanotube in sufficient time. When further assembled as an even detection device, it exhibited fast detection (&lt;30&#160;min), robust linear correlation (101&#8211;107 colony&#8208;forming units [CFU] mL&#8722;1, R2 = 0.997), ultrasensitivity (limit of detection = 1.7 CFU mL&#8722;1), and multitarget detection (Staphylococcus aureus, extracellular vesicles, and enterotoxin proteins). Collectively, the material and system offer an expanded platform for real&#8208;time diagnostics, enabling integrated rapid separation and detection of various disease biomarkers.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Conduction Dominated Hydrogels for Durable Zinc&#8211;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cation&#8208;conduction dominated hydrogel is engineered based on the anion&#8208;tethered strategy, distinguished by synergistic solvation effect, finely adjusted zinc nucleation properties, and the fortitude of iodine reactions, all with the specific intent of bolstering the durability and reliability of zinc&#8208;iodine batteries. This work is believed to push the progress of durable quasi&#8208;solid conversion&#8208;type aqueous batteries.








Abstract
Zinc&#8211;iodine batteries have the potential to offer high energy&#8208;density aqueous energy storage, but their lifetime is limited by the rampant dendrite growth and the concurrent parasite side reactions on the Zn anode, as well as the shuttling of polyiodides. Herein, a cation&#8208;conduction dominated hydrogel electrolyte is designed to holistically enhance the stability of both zinc anode and iodine cathode. In this hydrogel electrolyte, anions are covalently anchored on hydrogel chains, and the major mobile ions in the electrolyte are restricted to be Zn2+. Specifically, such a cation&#8208;conductive electrolyte results in a high zinc ion transference number (0.81) within the hydrogel and guides epitaxial Zn nucleation. Furthermore, the optimized Zn2+ solvation structure and the reconstructed hydrogen bond networks on hydrogel chains contribute to the reduced desolvation barrier and suppressed corrosion side reactions. On the iodine cathode side, the electrostatic repulsion between negative sulfonate groups and polyiodides hinders the loss of the iodine active material. This all&#8208;round electrolyte design renders zinc&#8211;iodine batteries with high reversibility, low self&#8208;discharge, and long lifespan.

         <title>Photochemical Shield Enabling Highly Efficient Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The open&#8208;air fabrication of perovskite photovoltaics will become the trend of commercialization of perovskite. However, the oxygen together with light becomes free radicals to accelerate phase transformation of FAPbI3, which further challenge the stability of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. Therefore, a photochemical shield strategy is developed by employing a light&#8208;oxygen sensitive molecule benzaldehyde.








Abstract
Oxygen is difficult to be physically removed. Oxygen will be excited by light to form free radicals which further attack the lattice of perovskite. The stabilization of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 against &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 is the key to optimize perovskite solar cells. Herein, the simple molecule, benzaldehyde (BAH) is adopted. The photochemical shield will be established in perovskite layer. Moreover, heterogeneous nucleation induced by BAH enhances the crystallization of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. Consequently, the stability of device is improved significantly. The target device maintains 95% of original power conversion efficiency after 1500&#160;h under air conditions and light&#8208;emitting diode light. The power conversion efficiency increases from 23.21% of pristine device to 24.82% of target device.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Reinforced Solvating Ionic Liquid Electrolytes Enabling Stable High&#8208;Nickel Cathode in Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anion&#8208;reinforced solvating ionic liquid electrolyte is developed to enhance the anion&#8211;cation coordination and promote more anions to enter the internal solvation sheath of Li+. This new type of ionic liquid electrolyte improves Li+ transport ability and stabilizes the interface between the electrolyte and high&#8208;nickel cathode, rendering the practical application toward high&#8208;safety and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Ionic liquid electrolytes (ILEs) are promising to develop high&#8208;safety and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). Unfortunately, ILEs normally face the challenge of sluggish Li+ transport due to increased ions&#8217; clustering caused by Coulombic interactions. Here a type of anion&#8208;reinforced solvating ILEs (ASILEs) is discovered, which reduce ions&#8217; clustering by enhancing the anion&#8211;cation coordination and promoting more anions to enter the internal solvation sheath of Li+ to address this concern. The designed ASILEs, incorporating chlorinated hydrocarbons and two anions, bis(fluorosulfonyl) imide (FSI&#8722;) and bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (TFSI&#8722;), aim to enhance Li+ transport ability, stabilize the interface of the high&#8208;nickel cathode material (LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, NCM811), and retain fire&#8208;retardant properties. With these ASILEs, the Li/NCM811 cell exhibits high initial specific capacity (203 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C), outstanding capacity retention (81.6% over 500 cycles at 1.0 C), and excellent average Coulombic efficiency (99.9% over 500 cycles at 1.0 C). Furthermore, an Ah&#8208;level Li/NCM811 pouch cell achieves a notable energy density of 386&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, indicating the practical feasibility of this electrolyte. This research offers a practical solution and fundamental guidance for the rational design of advanced ILEs, enabling the development of high&#8208;safety and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LMBs.

         <title>Strategies to Modulate the Copper Oxidation State Toward Selective C2+ Production in the Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;based catalysts have the advantage of producing various products compared to other metal&#8208;based CO2RR catalysts, but low selectivity for the desired product remains a challenge. This review introduces effective strategies to increase the selectivity of Cu&#8208;based CO2RR catalysts by controlling the oxidation state of Cu.








Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to form value&#8208;added chemicals receives considerable attention in recent years. Copper (Cu) is recognized as the only element capable of electro&#8208;reducing CO2 into hydrocarbons with two or more carbon atoms (C2+), but the low product selectivity of the Cu&#8208;based catalyst remains a major technological challenge to overcome. Therefore, identification of the structural features of Cu&#8208;based catalysts is of great importance for the highly selective production of C2+ products (ethylene, ethanol, n&#8208;propanol, etc.), and the oxidation state of Cu species in the catalysts is found critical to the catalyst performance. This review introduces recent efforts to fine&#8208;tune the oxidation state of Cu to increase carbon capture and produce specific C2+ compounds, with the intention of greatly expediting the advance in the catalyst designs. It also points to the remaining challenges and fruitful research directions for the development of Cu&#8208;based catalysts that can shape the practical CO2 reduction technology.

         <title>Paraffin&#8208;Enabled Superlattice Customization for a Photostimulated Gradient&#8208;Responsive Artificial Reflex Arc</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here a gradient&#8208;responsive photostimulated&#8208;motion artificial reflex arc enabled by programmable and tunable photoreceptor based on folded MoS2 with different twist angles is proposed. These patternable paraffin customized twist moir&#233; superlattice structures enable tuning of optoelectronic properties and gradient response with increasing twist angles, leading to a multiaction response capability in the artificial reflex arc.








Abstract
The development of photostimulated&#8208;motion artificial reflex arcs &#8212; a neural circuit inspired by light&#8208;driven motion reflexes &#8212; holds significant promises for advancements in robotic perception, navigation, and motion control. However, the fabrication of such systems, especially those that accommodate multiple actions and exhibit gradient responses, remains challenging. Here, a gradient&#8208;responsive photostimulated&#8208;motion artificial reflex arc is developed by integrating a programmable and tunable photoreceptor based on folded MoS2 at different twist angles. The twisted folded bilayer MoS2 used as photoreceptors can be customized via the transfer technique using patternable paraffin, where the twist angle and fold&#8208;line could be controlled. The photoluminescence (PL) intensity is 3.7 times higher at a twist angle of 29&#176; compared to that at 0&#176;, showing a monotonically decreasing indirect bandgap. Through tunable interlayer carrier transport, photoreceptors fabricated using folded bilayer MoS2 at different twist angles demonstrate gradient response time, enabling the photostimulated&#8208;motion artificial reflex arc for multiaction responses. They are transformed to digital command flow and studied via machine learning to control the gestures of a robotic hand, showing a prototype of photostimulated gradient&#8208;responsive artificial reflex arcs for the first time. This work provides a unique idea for developing intelligent soft robots and next&#8208;generation human&#8211;computer interfaces.

Through tunable interlayer carrier transport, photoreceptors fabricated using folded bilayer MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at different twist angles demonstrate gradient response time, enabling the photostimulated-motion artificial reflex arc for multiaction responses. They are transformed to digital command flow and studied via machine learning to control the gestures of a robotic hand, showing a prototype of photostimulated gradient-responsive artificial reflex arcs for the first time. This work provides a unique idea for developing intelligent soft robots and next-generation human&#8211;computer interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultralong Cycling and Safe Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Pouch Cells for Sustainable Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A durable Li anode prolongs the cycle performance of Li&#8211;S pouch cells far beyond the level in the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li&#8211;S batteries as well as renders unprecedented safe and rate performances, thus moving this dream technology a big step closer to reality.








Abstract
While layered metal oxides remain the dominant cathode materials for the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lithium&#8208;ion batteries, conversion&#8208;type cathodes such as sulfur present unique opportunities in developing cheaper, safer, and more energy&#8208;dense next&#8208;generation battery technologies. There has been remarkable progress in advancing the laboratory scale lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) coin cells to a high level of performance. However, the relevant strategies cannot be readily translated to practical cell formats such as pouch cells and even battery pack. Here these key technical challenges are addressed by molecular engineering of the Li metal for hydrophobicization, fluorination and thus favorable anode chemistry. The introduced tris(2,4&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl) phosphite (TBP) and tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBA+F&#8722;) as well as cellulose membrane by rolling enables the formation of a functional thin layer that eliminates the vulnerability of Li metal towards the already demanding environment required (1.55% relative humidity) for cell production and gives rise to LiF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to suppress dendrite growth. As a result, Li&#8211;S pouch cells assembled at a pilot production line survive 400 full charge/discharge cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.55% and impressive rate performance of 1.5 C. A cell&#8208;level energy density of 417&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and power density of 2766&#160;W kg&#8722;1 are also delivered via multilayer Li&#8211;S pouch cell. The Li&#8211;S battery pack can even power an unmanned aerial vehicle of 3&#160;kg for a fairly long flight time. This work represents a big step forward acceleration in Li&#8211;S battery marketization for future energy storage featuring improved safety, sustainability, higher energy density as well as reduced cost.

         <title>Switchable Anisotropic/Isotropic Photon Transport in a Double&#8211;Dipole Metal&#8208;Organic Framework via Radical&#8208;Controlled Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Directional control of photon transport at micro/nanoscale holds great potential in developing multifunctional optoelectronic devices. Here, we report the switchable anisotropic/isotropic photon transport in a double&#8208;dipole metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) based on radical&#8208;controlled energy transfer. Double&#8208;dipole MOF microcrystals with transition dipole moments perpendicular to each other have been achieved by the pillared&#8208;layer coordination strategy. The energy transfer between the double dipolar chromophores can be modulated by the photogenerated radicals, which permits the in situ switchable output on both polarization (isotropy/anisotropy state) and wavelength information (blue/red&#8208;color emission). On this basis, the original MOF microcrystal with isotropic polarization state displays the isotropic photon transport and similar re&#8208;absorption losses at various directions, while the radical&#8208;affected MOF microcrystal with anisotropic polarization state shows the anisotropic photon transport with distinct re&#8208;absorption losses at different directions, finally leading to the in situ switchable anisotropic/isotropic photon transport. These results offer a novel strategy for the development of MOF&#8208;based photonic devices with tunable anisotropic performance.

         <title>Embedded Physical Intelligence in Liquid Crystalline Polymer Actuators and Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Responsive materials possess the inherent capacity to autonomously sense and respond to various external stimuli, demonstrating physical intelligence. Among the diverse array of responsive materials, liquid crystalline polymers (LCPs) stand out for their remarkable reversible stimuli&#8208;responsive shape&#8208;morphing properties and their potential for creating soft robots. While numerous reviews have extensively detailed the progress in developing LCP&#8208;based actuators and robots, there exists a need for comprehensive summaries that elucidate the underlying principles governing actuation and how physical intelligence is embedded within these systems. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in developing actuators and robots endowed with physical intelligence using LCPs. Our review is structured around the stimulus conditions and categorizes the studies involving responsive LCPs based on the fundamental control and stimulation logic and approach. Specifically, we examine three main categories: systems that respond to changing stimuli, those operating under constant stimuli, and those equipped with learning and logic control capabilities. Furthermore, we outline the persisting challenges that need to be addressed and discuss the future avenues of research in this dynamic field.

         <title>Strain Regulation of Mixed&#8208;Halide Perovskites Enables High&#8208;Performance Wide&#8208;Bandgap Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap mixed&#8208;halogen perovskite materials are widely used as top cells in tandem solar cells. However, serious open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) loss restricts the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we show that the resulting methylammonium vacancies induce lattice distortion in methylammonium chloride&#8208;assisted perovskite film, resulting in an inhomogeneous halogen distribution and low Voc. Thus, a lattice strain regulation strategy is reported to fabricate high&#8208;performance wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs. Rubidium (Rb) cations are introduced to fill the A&#8208;site vacancy caused by the methylammonium volatilization, which alleviates shrinkage strain of the perovskite crystal. The reduced lattice distortion and increased halide ion migration barrier result in a homogeneous mixed&#8208;halide perovskite film. Due to improved carrier transport and suppressed nonradiative recombination, the Rb&#8208;treated wide&#8208;bandgap PSC (1.68&#160;eV) achieves an excellent PCE of 21.72%, accompanied by a high Voc of 1.22&#160;eV. The resulting device maintains more than 90% of its initial PCE after 1500&#160;h under 1&#8208;sun illumination conditions.

         <title>Focusing Micromechanical Polaritons in Topologically Nontrivial Hyperbolic Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Vertically stacked multiple atomically thin layers have recently widened the landscape of rich optical structures thanks to these quantum metamaterials or van der Waals (vdW) materials, featuring hyperbolic polaritons with unprecedented avenues for light. Despite their far&#8208;reaching implications, most of their properties rest entirely on a trivial band topological origin. Here, we&#160;adopt a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) approach towards a micromechanical vdW analogue that, as a result of engineered chiral and mirror symmetries, provides topologically resilient hyperbolic radiation of mechanical vibrations in the ultrasonic regime. By applying laser vibrometry of the micrometer&#8208;sized metasurface, we&#160;are able to exhibit the exotic fingerprints of robust hyperbolic radiation spanning several frequencies, which beyond their physical relevance, may enable ultrasonic&#160;technologies.

         <title>Recent Advances in Reversible Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carrier Systems: From Hydrogen Carriers to Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) have gained significant attention for large&#8208;scale hydrogen storage due to their remarkable gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity (HSC) and compatibility with existing oil and gas transportation networks for long&#8208;distance transport. However, the practical application of reversible LOHC systems has been constrained by the intrinsic thermodynamic properties of hydrogen carriers and the performances of associated catalysts in the (de)hydrogenation cycles. To overcome these challenges, thermodynamically favored carriers, high&#8208;performance catalysts, and catalytic procedures need to be developed. Here, significant advances in recent years have been summarized, primarily centered on regular LOHC systems catalyzed by homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, including dehydrogenative aromatization of cycloalkanes to arenes and N&#8208;heterocyclics to N&#8208;heteroarenes, as well as reverse hydrogenation processes. Furthermore, with the development of metal complexes for dehydrogenative coupling, a new family of reversible LOHC systems based on alcohols is described that can release H2 under relatively mild conditions. Finally, views on the next steps and challenges in the field of LOHC technology are provided, emphasizing new resources for low&#8208;cost hydrogen carriers, high&#8208;performance catalysts, catalytic technologies, and application scenarios.

         <title>Probing Hyperbolic Shear Polaritons in &#914;&#8208;Ga2O3 Nanostructures Using STEM&#8208;EELS</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Phonon polaritons, quasiparticles arising from strong coupling between electromagnetic waves and optical phonons, have potential for applications in sub&#8208;diffraction imaging, sensing, thermal conduction enhancement, and spectroscopy signal enhancement. A new class of phonon polaritons in low&#8208;symmetry monoclinic crystals, hyperbolic shear polaritons (HShPs), have been verified recently in &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 by free electron laser (FEL) measurements. However, detailed behaviors of HShPs in &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 nanostructures still remain unknown. Here, by using monochromatic electron energy loss spectroscopy in conjunction with scanning transmission electron microscopy, we report the experimental observation of multiple HShPs in &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 in the mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) and far&#8208;infrared (FIR) ranges. We excite HShPs in various &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 nanorods and a &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 nanodisk. The frequency&#8208;dependent rotation and shear effect of HShPs reflect on the distribution of EELS signals. The propagation and reflection of HShPs in nanostructures are clarified by simulations of electric field distribution. These findings suggest that, with its tunable broad spectral HShPs, &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 is an excellent candidate for nanophotonic applications.

         <title>Chemical Vapor Deposition Synthesis of Intrinsic High&#8208;temperature Ferroelectric 2D CuCrSe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ultrathin 2D ferroelectrics with high Curie temperature are critical for multi&#8208;functional ferroelectric devices. However, the ferroelectric spontaneous polarization is consistently broken by the strong thermal fluctuations at high temperature, resulting in the rare discovery of high&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity in 2D materials. Here, we report a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method to synthesize 2D CuCrSe2 nanosheets. The crystal structure is confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) characterization. The measured ferroelectric phase transition temperature of ultrathin CuCrSe2 is about &#8764; 800 K. Significantly, the switchable ferroelectric polarization is observed in &#8764; 5.2&#160;nm nanosheet. Moreover, the in&#8208;plane (IP) and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (OOP) ferroelectric response are modulated by different maximum bias voltage. This work provides a new insight into the construction of 2D ferroelectrics with high Curie temperature.

         <title>Homeostatic Solid Solution Reaction in Phosphate Cathode: Breaking High&#8208;Voltage Barrier to Achieve High Energy Density and Long Life of Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The stable phase transformation during electrochemical progress drives extensive research on vanadium&#8208;based polyanions in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), especially Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP). And the electron transfer between V3+/4+ redox couple in NVP could be generally achieved, owing to the confined crystal variation during battery service. However, the more favorable V4+/5+ redox couple is still in hard&#8208;to&#8208;access situation due to the high barrier and further bring about the corresponding inefficiency in energy densities. In this work, the multilevel redox in NVP frame (MLNP) alters reaction pathway to undergo homeostatic solid solution process and breaks the high barrier of V4+/5+ at high voltage, taking by progressive transition metal (V, Fe, Ti and Cr) redox couple. The diversified reaction paths across diffusion barriers could be realized by distinctive release/uptake of inactive Na1 site, confirmed by the calculations of density functional theory. Thereby its volume change is merely 1.73% during the multielectron&#8208;transfer process (&#8764;2.77 electrons). MLNP cathode could achieve an impressive energy density of 440&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, driving the leading development of MLNP among other NASICON structure SIBs. The integration of multiple redox couples with low strain modulates the reaction pathway effectively and will open a new avenue for fabricating high&#8208;performance cathodes in SIBs.

         <title>Intrinsic Defect&#8208;Driven Synergistic Synaptic Heterostructures for Gate&#8208;Free Neuromorphic Phototransistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The optoelectronic synaptic devices based on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials offers great advances for future neuromorphic visual systems with dramatically improved integration density and power efficiency. The effective charge capture and retention have been considered as one vital prerequisite to realize the synaptic memory function. However, the current 2D synaptic devices are predominantly relied on materials with artificially&#8208;engineered defects or intricate gate&#8208;controlled architectures to realize the charge trapping process. These approaches, unfortunately, suffer from the degradation of pristine materials, rapid device failure, and unnecessary complication of device structures. To address these challenges, we herein introduce an innovative gate&#8208;free heterostructure paradigm. The heterostructure presents a distinctive dome&#8208;like morphology wherein a defect&#8208;rich Fe7S8 core is enveloped snugly by a curved MoS2 dome shell (Fe7S8@MoS2), allowing the realization of effective photocarrier trapping through the intrinsic defects in the adjacent Fe7S8 core. The resultant neuromorphic devices exhibit remarkable light&#8208;tunable synaptic behaviors with memory time up to &#8764;800 s under single optical pulse, thus demonstrating great advances in simulating visual recognition system with significantly improved image recognition efficiency. The emergence of such heterostructures foreshadows a promising trajectory for underpinning future synaptic devices, catalyzing the realization of high&#8208;efficiency and intricate visual processing applications.

         <title>Simple&#8208;Structured Acceptor with Highly Interconnected Electron&#8208;Transport Pathway Enables High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Achieving desirable charge&#8208;transport highway is of vital importance for high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs). Here, we show how molecular packing arrangements can be regulated via tuning the alkyl&#8208;chain topology, thus resulting in a three&#8208;dimensional network stacking and highly interconnected pathway for electron transport in a simple&#8208;structured nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptor (NFREA) with branched alkyl side&#8208;chains. As a result, a record&#8208;breaking power conversion efficiency of 17.38% (certificated 16.59%) is achieved for NFREA&#8208;based devices, thus providing an opportunity for constructing low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;efficiency OSCs.

As a result, a record-breaking power conversion efficiency of 17.38% (certificated 16.59%) is achieved for NFREA-based devices, thus providing an opportunity for constructing low-cost and high-efficiency OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Efficient Ion Percolating Network for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Cathodes</title>

Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) face critical challenges of low cathode loading and poor rate performances, which handicaps their energy/power densities. The widely&#8208;accepted aim of high ionic conductivity and low interfacial resistance seems insufficient to overcome these challenges. Here, we reveal that efficient ion percolating network in the cathode exert a more critical influence on electrochemical performance of ASSLBs. By constructing vertical alignment of Li0.35La0.55TiO3 nanowires (LLTO NWs) in solid&#8208;state cathode through magnetic manipulation, ionic conductivity of the cathode increases twice compared with the cathode consisted of randomly distributed LLTO NWs. The all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LiFePO4/Li cells using poly(ethylene oxide) as electrolyte is able to deliver high capacities of 151 mAh g&#8722;1 (2 C) and 100 mAh g&#8722;1 (5 C) at 60 &#176;C, and a room&#8208;temperature capacity of 108 mAh g&#8722;1 can be achieved at a charging rate of 2 C. Furthermore, the cell can reach a high areal capacity of 3 mAh cm&#8722;2 even with a practical LFP loading of 20&#160;mg cm&#8722;2. The universality of this strategy is also presented showing the demonstration in LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathodes. This work offers new pathways for designing ASSLBs with improved energy/power densities.

         <title>A 2D Cryptographic Hash Function Incorporating Homomorphic Encryption for Secure Digital Signatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
User authentication is one of the most critical aspects within any information exchange system and encompasses the process of verifying the identity of individuals seeking access to sensitive information. Conventionally, this verification process has relied on establishing robust and secure digital signature protocols employing asymmetric encryption techniques which effectively address the vulnerabilities inherent to symmetric encryption methods that necessitate sharing and reuse of the secret key. In this article, we present a comprehensive hardware&#8208;based digital signature platform constructed using integrated circuits (ICs) with atomically thin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) memtransistors. First, we demonstrate generation of secure and robust cryptographic keys by exploiting the inherent stochasticity of carrier trapping and detrapping at the 2D/oxide interface trap sites as the source of randomness. Subsequently, we leverage the capability of manipulating the functionality of logical NOR through localized programming of MoS2 memtransistor to create a secure one&#8208;way hash function which when homomorphically operated upon with NAND, XOR, OR, NOT, and AND logic circuits generate distinct and secure signatures. These signatures are subsequently decrypted to verify the authenticity of the receiver while ensuring complete preservation of data integrity and confidentiality as the underlying information is never revealed. Finally, we provide an insight on the advantages of implementing NOR based hashing techniques in comparison to the conventional XOR based encryption method. Our demonstration highlights the potential of 2D&#8208;based ICs in advancing the development of critical information security primitives.

         <title>Quantitative Assessment of Fungal Biomarkers in Clinical Samples via an Interface&#8208;Modulated Optical Fiber Biosensor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Invasive fungal infections pose a significant public health threat. The lack of precise and timely diagnosis is a primary factor contributing to the significant increase in patient mortality rates. Here, we report an interface&#8208;modulated biosensor utilizing an optical fiber for quantitative analysis of fungal biomarkers at the early stage for point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing. By integrating surface refractive index modulation and plasmon enhancement, we successfully optimized the sensor to achieve the highest sensitivity in a directional response to the target analytes. As a result, we developed a compact fiber optic sensor with rapid response time, cost&#8208;effectiveness, exceptional sensitivity, stability, and specificity. This sensor can successfully identify the biomarkers of specific pathogens from blood or other tissue specimens in animal models. It quantifies clinical blood samples with precision and effectively discriminates between negative and positive cases, thereby providing timely alerts to potential patients. It significantly reduces the detection time of fungal infection to only 30 minutes. Additionally, this approach exhibits remarkable stability and achieves a limit of detection three orders of magnitude lower than existing methods. It overcomes the limitations of existing detection methods, including a high rate of misdiagnosis, prolonged detection time, elevated costs, and the requirement for stringent laboratory conditions.

         <title>Multi&#8208;dimensional Multiplexed Metasurface Holography by Inverse Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Multi&#8208;dimensional multiplexed metasurface holography extends holographic information capacity, promises revolutionary advancements for vivid imaging, information storage and encryption. However, achieving multifunctional metasurface holography by forward design method is still difficult since it relies heavily on Jones matrix engineering, which places high demands on physical knowledge and processing technology. To break these limitations and simplify the design process, here we propose an end&#8208;to&#8208;end inverse design framework. By directly linking the metasurface to the reconstructed images and employing a loss function to guide the update of metasurface, the calculation of hologram can be omitted, thus greatly simplifying the design process. In addition, the requirements on the completeness of meta&#8208;library can also be significantly reduced, allowing multi&#8208;channel hologram to be achieved using meta&#8208;atoms with only two degrees of freedom, which is very friendly to processing. By exploiting the proposed method, metasurface hologram containing up to 12 channels of multi&#8208;wavelength, multi&#8208;plane and multi&#8208;polarization are designed and experimentally demonstrated, which exhibits the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art information multiplexing capacity of the metasurface composed of simple meta&#8208;atoms. Our method is conducive to promoting the intelligent design of multifunctional meta&#8208;devices, and it is expected to eventually accelerate the application of meta&#8208;devices in colorful display, imaging, storage and other fields.

         <title>Selective Induction of Molecular Assembly to Tissue&#8208;Level Anisotropy on Peptide&#8208;Based Optoelectronic Cardiac Biointerfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a cardiac photoconductive biointerface capable of inducing biomolecular assembly ordering and anisotropic cellular organization. In particular, it is demonstrated that 1D nanoassemblies comprised of &#960;&#8208;conjugated peptides with high degree of molecular ordering on nanogrooved polymeric templates can effectively induce cardiac cytoskeletal anisotropy and sarcomeric alignment through nanotopographic cues with potential photostimulation ability.








Abstract
The conduction efficiency of ions in excitable tissues and of charged species in organic conjugated materials both benefit from having ordered domains and anisotropic pathways. In this study, a photocurrent&#8208;generating cardiac biointerface is presented, particularly for investigating the sensitivity of cardiomyocytes to geometrically comply to biomacromolecular cues differentially assembled on a conductive nanogrooved substrate. Through a polymeric surface&#8208;templated approach, photoconductive substrates with symmetric peptide&#8208;quaterthiophene (4T)&#8208;peptide units assembled as 1D nanostructures on nanoimprinted polyalkylthiophene (P3HT) surface are developed. The 4T&#8208;based peptides studied here can form 1D nanostructures on prepatterned polyalkylthiophene substrates, as directed by hydrogen bonding, aromatic interactions between 4T and P3HT, and physical confinement on the nanogrooves. It is observed that smaller 4T&#8208;peptide units that can achieve a higher degree of assembly order within the polymeric templates serve as a more efficient driver of cardiac cytoskeletal anisotropy than merely presenting aligned &#8208;RGD bioadhesive epitopes on a nanotopographic surface. These results unravel some insights on how cardiomyocytes perceive submicrometer dimensionality, local molecular order, and characteristics of surface cues in their immediate environment. Overall, the work offers a cardiac patterning platform that presents the possibility of a gene modification&#8208;free cardiac photostimulation approach while controlling the conduction directionality of the biotic and abiotic components.

         <title>Enhanced CO2 Electrolysis Through Mn Substitution Coupled with Ni Exsolution in Lanthanum Calcium Titanate Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite oxides La0.3Ca0.6Ni0.05MnxTi0.95&#8722;xO3&#8722;&#947; are investigated as potential solid oxide electrolysis cell cathode materials. Their electrocatalytic activity toward CO2 reduction is enhanced through the exsolution Ni nanoparticles enhanced by electrochemical poling and coupled with Mn codoping. Mn dopants enable more flexible coordination, facilitating oxygen ion migration resulting in more Ni nanoparticles and improved adsorption, desorption, and dissociation of CO2 molecules.








Abstract
In this study, perovskite oxides La0.3Ca0.6Ni0.05MnxTi0.95&#8722;xO3&#8722;&#947; (x = 0, 0.05, 0.10) are investigated as potential solid oxide electrolysis cell cathode materials. The catalytic activity of these cathodes toward CO2 reduction reaction is significantly enhanced through the exsolution of highly active Ni nanoparticles, driven by applying a current of 1.2 A in 97% CO2 &#8211; 3% H2O. The performance of La0.3Ca0.6Ni0.05Ti0.95O3&#8722;&#947; is notably improved by co&#8208;doping with Mn. Mn dopants enhance the reducibility of Ni, a crucial factor in promoting the in situ exsolution of metallic nanocatalysts in perovskite (ABO3) structures. This improvement is attributed to Mn dopants enabling more flexible coordination, resulting in higher oxygen vacancy concentration, and facilitating oxygen ion migration. Consequently, a higher density of Ni nanoparticles is formed. These oxygen vacancies also improve the adsorption, desorption, and dissociation of CO2 molecules. The dual doping strategy provides enhanced performance without degradation observed after 133&#160;h of high&#8208;temperature operation, suggesting a reliable cathode material for CO2 electrolysis.

         <title>Locally Strained 2D Materials: Preparation, Properties, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D materials hold great promise in strain engineering. By introducing out&#8208;of&#8208;plane deformations, localized and non&#8208;uniform strain can be induced, leading to novel phenomena and unique properties. This review systematically outlines the recent progress in the preparation, properties, and applications of locally strained 2D materials, aiming to broaden the scope of the 2D family for diverse applications.








Abstract
2D materials are promising for strain engineering due to their atomic thickness and exceptional mechanical properties. In particular, non&#8208;uniform and localized strain can be induced in 2D materials by generating out&#8208;of&#8208;plane deformations, resulting in novel phenomena and properties, as witnessed in recent years. Therefore, the locally strained 2D materials are of great value for both fundamental studies and practical applications. This review discusses techniques for introducing local strains to 2D materials, and their feasibility, advantages, and challenges. Then, the unique effects and properties that arise from local strain are explored. The representative applications based on locally strained 2D materials are illustrated, including memristor, single photon emitter, and photodetector. Finally, concluding remarks on the challenges and opportunities in the emerging field of locally strained 2D materials are provided.

         <title>Metasurface for Engineering Superimposed Ince&#8208;Gaussian Beams</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ince&#8208;Gaussian beams (IGBs) represent the exact and continuous transition modes connecting Laguerre&#8211;Gaussian and Hermite&#8211;Gaussian beams. A single metasurface is used to generate superimposed IGBs through the superposition of even and odd Ince modes. This work addresses critical challenges in IGB research, including light weight, compactness, phase singularity manipulation, and dynamic modulation of polarization singularities.








Abstract
Ince&#8208;Gaussian beams (IGBs) are the third complete family of exact and orthogonal solutions of the paraxial wave equation and have been applied in many fields ranging from particle trapping to quantum optics. IGBs play a very important role in optics as they represent the exact and continuous transition modes connecting Laguerre&#8211;Gaussian and Hermite&#8211;Gaussian beams. The method currently in use suffers from the high cost, complexity, and large volume of the optical system. The superposition of IGBs can generate complicated structured beams with multiple phase and polarization singularities. A metasurface approach is proposed to realizing various superpositions of IGBs without relying on a complicated optical setup. By superimposing IGBs with even and odd modes, multiple phase, and polarization singularities are observed in the resultant beams. The phase and polarization singularities are modulated by setting the initial phase in the design and controlling the incident linear polarization. The compactness of the developed metasurface devices and the unique properties of the generated beams have the potential to impact many practical applications such as particle manipulation, orbital angular momentum spectrum manipulation, and optical communications.

         <title>Gradient Pores Enhance Charge Storage Density of Carbonaceous Cathodes for Zn&#8208;Ion Capacitor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charge density of Zn&#8208;ion capacitor (ZIC)&#160;is significantly enhanced by deploying an activated meso&#8208;microporous shell&#160;carbon (MMSC&#8208;A) nanofibers. The tailored pore size and gradient&#8208;pore structure endow the nanofibers with unusual charge storage mechanism, as elucidated by multiple in situ means.








Abstract
Engineering carbonaceous cathode materials with adequately accessible active sites is crucial for unleashing their charge storage potential. Herein, activated meso&#8208;microporous shell carbon (MMSC&#8208;A)&#160;nanofibers are constructed to enhance the zinc ion storage density by forming a gradient&#8208;pore structure. A dominating pore size of 0.86&#160;nm is tailored to cater for the solvated [Zn(H2O)6]2+. Moreover, these gradient porous nanofibers feature rapid ion/electron dual conduction pathways and offer abundant active surfaces with high affinity to electrolyte. When employed in Zn&#8208;ion capacitors (ZICs), the electrode delivers significantly enhanced capacity (257 mAh g&#8722;1), energy density (200&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 78&#160;W kg&#8722;1), and cyclic stability (95% retention after 10&#160;000 cycles) compared to nonactivated carbon nanofibers electrode. A series of in situ characterization techniques unveil that the improved Zn2+ storage capability stems from size compatibility between the pores and [Zn(H2O)6]2+, the co&#8208;adsorption of Zn2+, H+, and SO42&#8722;, as well as reversible surface chemical interaction. This work presents an effective method to engineering meso&#8208;microporous carbon materials toward high energy&#8208;density storage, and also offers insights into the Zn2+ storage mechanism in such gradient&#8208;pore structures.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Driven Proton Sponge Nano&#8208;Assembly for Imaging and Triggering Lysosome&#8208;Regulated Immunogenic Cancer Cell Death</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Triggering lysosome&#8208;regulated immunogenic cell death (ICD, e.g., pyroptosis and necroptosis) with nanomedicines is an emerging approach for turning an &#8220;immune&#8208;cold&#8221; tumor &#8220;hot&#8221;&#8212; a key challenge faced by cancer immunotherapies. Proton sponge such as high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight branched polyethylenimine (PEI) is excellent at rupturing lysosomes, but its therapeutic application is hindered by uncontrollable toxicity due to fixed charge density and poor understanding of resulted cell death mechanism. Here, a series of proton sponge nano&#8208;assemblies (PSNAs) with self&#8208;assembly controllable surface charge density and cell cytotoxicity were created. Such PSNAs were constructed via low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight branched PEI covalently bound to self&#8208;assembling peptides carrying tetraphenylethene pyridinium (PyTPE, an aggregation&#8208;induced emission based luminogen). Assembly of PEI assisted by the self&#8208;assembling peptide&#8208;PyTPE led to enhanced surface positive charges and cell cytotoxicity of PSNA. The self&#8208;assembly tendency of PSNAs was further optimized by tuning hydrophilic and hydrophobic components within the peptide, thus resulting in the PSNA with the highest fluorescence, positive surface charge density, cell uptake, and cancer cell cytotoxicity. Systematic cell death mechanistic studies revealed that the lysosome rupturing&#8208;regulated pyroptosis and necroptosis are at least two causes of the cell death. Tumor cells undergoing PSNA&#8208;triggered ICD activated immune cells, suggesting the great potential of PSNAs to trigger anticancer immunity.

&lt;p&gt;Triggering lysosome-regulated immunogenic cell death (ICD, e.g., pyroptosis and necroptosis) with nanomedicines is an emerging approach for turning an &#8220;immune-cold&#8221; tumor &#8220;hot&#8221;&#8212; a key challenge faced by cancer immunotherapies. Proton sponge such as high-molecular-weight branched polyethylenimine (PEI) is excellent at rupturing lysosomes, but its therapeutic application is hindered by uncontrollable toxicity due to fixed charge density and poor understanding of resulted cell death mechanism. Here, a series of proton sponge nano-assemblies (PSNAs) with self-assembly controllable surface charge density and cell cytotoxicity were created. Such PSNAs were constructed via low-molecular-weight branched PEI covalently bound to self-assembling peptides carrying tetraphenylethene pyridinium (PyTPE, an aggregation-induced emission based luminogen). Assembly of PEI assisted by the self-assembling peptide-PyTPE led to enhanced surface positive charges and cell cytotoxicity of PSNA. The self-assembly tendency of PSNAs was further optimized by tuning hydrophilic and hydrophobic components within the peptide, thus resulting in the PSNA with the highest fluorescence, positive surface charge density, cell uptake, and cancer cell cytotoxicity. Systematic cell death mechanistic studies revealed that the lysosome rupturing-regulated pyroptosis and necroptosis are at least two causes of the cell death. Tumor cells undergoing PSNA-triggered ICD activated immune cells, suggesting the great potential of PSNAs to trigger anticancer immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Inflammation&#8208;Responsive Cell Membrane&#8208;Camouflaged Nanoparticles against Liver Fibrosis via Regulating Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Oxidative Stress</title>

Abstract
Liver fibrosis represents a reversible stage of various chronic liver diseases that progresses to cirrhosis. This condition is characterized by an imbalance between tissue damage and repair, and the production of fibers in the liver exceeds their degradation. Oxidative stress (OS) resulting from tissue injury and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) triggered by overproduction of proteins are pivotal factors in liver fibrosis. Melatonin demonstrates the capability to neutralize free radicals, shielding cells from oxidative harm. It is also a specific inhibitor of the ERS receptor transcription activating factor 6 (ATF6), indicating its great potential in ameliorating liver fibrosis. However, its limited water solubility and oral bioavailability of under 15% present hurdles in achieving therapeutic blood concentrations for treating liver fibrosis. The PLGA@melatonin was constructed by loading melatonin with poly (lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA). Platelet membranes (PM) and activated hepatic stellate cell membranes (HSCM) with high expression of the platelet&#8208;derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) were extracted to successfully construct PM@PLGA@Melatonin and HSCM@PLGA@Melatonin, which were subsequently utilized to treat mice with liver fibrosis. The results illustrated the remarkable therapeutic effects of the two nanoparticles on liver fibrosis, along with their excellent targeting and biosafety properties.

         <title>High&#8208;Safety Electrolytes with an Anion&#8208;Rich Solvation Structure Tuned by Difluorinated Cations for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel medium concentration electrolyte is designed based on the gem&#8208;difluorinated ionic liquid with ultrahigh safety, high voltage stability, high temperature stability, and excellent Ni&#8208;rich cathode compatibility.








Abstract
As next&#8208;generation energy storage devices, lithium metal batteries (LMBs) must offer high safety, high&#8208;voltage resistance, and a long life span. Electrolyte engineering is a facile strategy to tailor the interfacial chemistry of LMBs. In particular, the solvation structure and derived solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) are crucial for a satisfactory battery performance. Herein, a novel middle&#8208;concentrated ionic liquid electrolyte (MCILE) with an anion&#8208;rich solvation structure tuned by difluorinated cations is demonstrated to achieve ultrahigh safety, high&#8208;voltage stability, and excellent ternary&#8208;cathode compatibility. Novel gem&#8208;difluorinated cations first synthesized for prestoring fluorine on positively charged species, not only preferentially adsorb in the inner&#8208;Helmholtz layers, but also participate in regulating the Li+ solvation structure, resulting in a robust interphase. Moreover, these weak interactions in the Li+ solvation structure including anion&#8211;solvent and ionic liquid (IL) cation&#8211;solvent pairs are first revealed, which are beneficial for promoting an anion&#8208;dominated solvation structure and the desolvation process. Benefiting from the unique anion&#8208;rich solvation structure, a stable hetero&#8208;SEI structure is obtained. The designed MCILE exhibits compatibility with Li metal anode and the high&#8208;voltage ternary cathode at high temperatures (60&#160;&#176;C). This work provides a new approach for regulating the solvation structure and electrode interphase chemistry of LMBs via difluorinated IL cations.

         <title>Targeting Compact and Ordered Emitters by Supramolecular Dynamic Interactions for High&#8208;performance Organic Ambient Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The compact and ordered RTP emitters exhibit superior phosphorescent performance compared with disordered counterparts, thus greatly extending the applications. This review presents a timely introduction to the fundamental concepts and recent progress in design and preparation strategies, optical properties, underlying luminescent mechanisms and applications, providing general guidance for advancing future development of high&#8208;performance RTP materials.








Abstract
Purely organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have received intense attention due to their fascinating optical properties and advanced optoelectronic applications. The promotion of intersystem crossing (ISC) and minimalization of nonradiative dissipation under ambient conditions are key prerequisites for realizing high&#8208;performance organic RTP; However, the ISC process is generally inefficient for organic fluorogens and the populated triplet excitons are always too susceptible to be well stabilized by conventional means. Particularly, organizing organic fluorophores into compact and ordered entities by supramolecular dynamic interactions has proven to be a newly&#8208;emerged strategy to boost the ISC process greatly and suppress the non&#8208;radiative relaxations immensely, facilitating the population and stabilization of triplet excitons to access high&#8208;performance organic RTP. Consequently, well&#8208;defined organic emitters enable robust RTP emission even in the solution state, thus greatly extending the applications. Here, this review is focused on a timely and brief introduction to recent progress in tailoring ordered high&#8208;performance RTP emitters by supramolecular dynamic interactions. Their typical preparation strategies, optoelectronic properties, and applications are thoroughly summarized. In the summary section, key challenges and perspectives of this field are highlighted to suggest potential directions for future study.

         <title>Fully Printable and Reconfigurable Hufu&#8208;type Electroluminescent Devices for Visualized Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enlightened by Hufu (tiger tallies) in ancient China, a reconfigurable electroluminescent (EL) device is realized by assembling two separate parts using an adhesive and stretchable polymer gel composite as transparent electrodes. The incorporation of this reconfigurable feature allows for applications in stretchable displays capable of changing content and visual encryption.








Abstract
Hufu, serving as evidence of imperial authorization in ancient China, comprises two parts in the form of tiger&#8208;shaped tallies that only become effective when matched. Drawing inspiration from the concept of Hufu, a reconfigurable electroluminescent (EL) device is designed by separating conventional integral devices into two parts that contain the EL layer (part A) and the transparent electrode (part B), respectively. The key to realizing such strategy is employing an adhesive and stretchable polymer gel composite as the transparent electrodes for the EL devices. The polymer gel composite facilitates robust yet reversible contact between the EL layer and transparent electrode, enabling high&#8208;performance and stretchable EL devices that can be readily disassembled and reassembled: the EL devices can maintain &#8776;81% of their initial luminance after 1000 times of repeated disassembly and reassembly. Moreover, the precursor ink of the polymer gel composite is compatible with a wide variety of coating and printing technologies, such as spin&#8208;coating, inkjet printing, dispensing, and brush painting. Importantly, the reconfigurable feature of the devices opens up a new path to encryption display systems, and as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, EL encrypted password, and content&#8208;changeable digital clock are demonstrated.

         <title>Linearly Interlinked Fe&#8208;Nx&#8208;Fe Single Atoms Catalyze High&#8208;Rate Sodium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a novel linearly linked iron single&#8208;atom catalyst is developed. The interconnected iron single&#8208;atom and columnated carbon channels can respectively accelerate electron transfer and sodium ion diffusion, enabling the sulfur cathode to exhibit high&#8208;rate conversion and superior cycling stability.








Abstract
Linearly interlinked single atoms offer unprecedented physiochemical properties, but their synthesis for practical applications still poses significant challenges. Herein, linearly interlinked iron single&#8208;atom catalysts that are loaded onto interconnected carbon channels as cathodic sulfur hosts for room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur batteries are presented. The interlinked iron single&#8208;atom exhibits unique metallic iron bonds that facilitate the transfer of electrons to the sulfur cathode, thereby accelerating the reaction kinetics. Additionally, the columnated and interlinked carbon channels ensure rapid Na+ diffusion kinetics to support high&#8208;rate battery reactions. By combining the iron atomic chains and the topological carbon channels, the resulting sulfur cathodes demonstrate effective high&#8208;rate conversion performance while maintaining excellent stability. Remarkably, even after 5000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g&#8722;1, the Na&#8208;S battery retains a capacity of 325 mAh g&#8722;1. This work can open a new avenue in the design of catalysts and carbon ionic channels, paving the way to achieve sustainable and high&#8208;performance energy devices.

The interlinked iron single-atom exhibits unique metallic iron bonds that facilitate the transfer of electrons to the sulfur cathode, thereby accelerating the reaction kinetics. Additionally, the columnated and interlinked carbon channels ensure rapid Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion kinetics to support high-rate battery reactions. By combining the iron atomic chains and the topological carbon channels, the resulting sulfur cathodes demonstrate effective high-rate conversion performance while maintaining excellent stability. Remarkably, even after 5000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, the Na-S battery retains a capacity of 325 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This work can open a new avenue in the design of catalysts and carbon ionic channels, paving the way to achieve sustainable and high-performance energy devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multifunctional Conductive and Electrogenic Hydrogel Repaired Spinal Cord Injury via Immunoregulation and Enhancement of Neuronal Differentiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;crosslinked conductive hydrogel has been developed to generate electrical signals and exhibit electrogenic characteristic in the rotating magnetic field. This non&#8208;invasive, well&#8208;distributed, wireless, conductive, and magnetically induced electrogenic system can elicit functional recovery in spinal cord injury mice by anti&#8208;inflammation and facilitating the formation of functional neurons and synapses, providing a novel perspective for the clinical translation.








Abstract
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a refractory neurological disorder. Due to the complex pathological processes, especially the secondary inflammatory cascade and the lack of intrinsic regenerative capacity, it is difficult to recover neurological function after SCI. Meanwhile, simulating the conductive microenvironment of the spinal cord reconstructs electrical neural signal transmission interrupted by SCI and facilitates neural repair. Therefore, a double&#8208;crosslinked conductive hydrogel (BP@Hydrogel) containing black phosphorus nanoplates (BP) is synthesized. When placed in a rotating magnetic field (RMF), the BP@Hydrogel can generate stable electrical signals and exhibit electrogenic characteristic. In vitro, the BP@Hydrogel shows satisfactory biocompatibility and can alleviate the activation of microglia. When placed in the RMF, it enhances the anti&#8208;inflammatory effects. Meanwhile, wireless electrical stimulation promotes the differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) into neurons, which is associated with the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. In vivo, the BP@Hydrogel is injectable and can elicit behavioral and electrophysiological recovery in complete transected SCI mice by alleviating the inflammation and facilitating endogenous NSCs to form functional neurons and synapses under the RMF. The present research develops a multifunctional conductive and electrogenic hydrogel for SCI repair by targeting multiple mechanisms including immunoregulation and enhancement of neuronal differentiation.

         <title>Engineering Dual CO2&#8208; and Photothermal&#8208;Responsive Membranes for Switchable Double Emulsion Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;coated fiber consisting of primary photothermal&#8208;responsive and secondary CO2&#8208;responsive coatings is prepared by two&#8208;step coating. Automated weaving of these fibers produces membranes with photothermal&#8208; and CO2&#8208;responsive characteristics, achieving on&#8208;demand separation of various double oil&#8208;in&#8208;water&#8208;in&#8208;oil and water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions with separation efficiencies exceeding 99.6%. 








Abstract
Stimulus&#8208;responsive membranes demonstrate promising applications in switchable oil/water emulsion separations. However, they are unsuitable for the treatment of double emulsions like oil&#8208;in&#8208;water&#8208;in&#8208;oil (O/W/O) and water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water (W/O/W) emulsions. For efficient separation of these complicated emulsions, fine control over the wettability, response time, and aperture structure of the membrane is required. Herein, dual&#8208;coated fibers consisting of primary photothermal&#8208;responsive and secondary CO2&#8208;responsive coatings are prepared by two steps. Automated weaving of these fibers produces membranes with photothermal&#8208; and CO2&#8208;responsive characteristics and narrow pore size distributions. These membranes exhibit fast switching wettability between superhydrophilicity (under CO2 stimulation) and high hydrophobicity (under near&#8208;infrared stimulation), achieving on&#8208;demand separation of various O/W/O and W/O/W emulsions with separation efficiencies exceeding 99.6%. Two&#8208;dimensional low&#8208;field nuclear magnetic resonance and correlated spectra technique are used to clarify the underlying mechanism of switchable double emulsion separation. The approach can effectively address the challenges associated with the use of stimulus&#8208;responsive membranes for double emulsion separation and facilitate the industrial application of these membranes.

         <title>A Universal Perovskite/C60 Interface Modification via Atomic Layer Deposited Aluminum Oxide for Perovskite Solar Cells and Perovskite&#8211;Silicon Tandems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite&#8211;silicon tandem solar cells could be the future of PV, but stability and easy fabrication are the keys. Here, an atomic layer deposited aluminum oxide that universally results in a 1% absolute efficiency boost is shown, resulting in 30% power conversion efficiency for a tandem and enhanced device lifetime, paving the way for more reliable solar energy solutions.








Abstract
The primary performance limitation in inverted perovskite&#8208;based solar cells is the interface between the fullerene&#8208;based electron transport layers and the perovskite. Atomic layer deposited thin aluminum oxide (AlOX) interlayers that reduce nonradiative recombination at the perovskite/C60 interface are developed, resulting in &gt;60 millivolts improvement in open&#8208;circuit voltage and 1% absolute improvement in power conversion efficiency. Surface&#8208;sensitive characterizations indicate the presence of a thin, conformally deposited AlOx layer, functioning as a passivating contact. These interlayers work universally using different lead&#8208;halide&#8211;based absorbers with different compositions where the 1.55 electron volts bandgap single junction devices reach &gt;23% power conversion efficiency. A reduction of metallic Pb0 is found and the compact layer prevents in&#8208; and egress of volatile species, synergistically improving the stability. AlOX&#8208;modified wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite absorbers as a top cell in a monolithic perovskite&#8211;silicon tandem enable a certified power conversion efficiency of 29.9% and open&#8208;circuit voltages above 1.92 volts for 1.17 square centimeters device area.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Touch Sensor for Simultaneous Tactile and Slip Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasensitive piezoresistive touch sensor is developed using phase inversion along with the sacrificial template method and used for normal pressure and slip sensing. It can perform multimodal sensing on complex contact states. The output signal is processed using a wavelet transform to obtain the frequency&#8208;domain characteristics of the slip signal and achieve simultaneous detection of pressure and sliding states.








Abstract
Touch is a general term to describe mechanical stimuli. It is extremely difficult to develop touch sensors that can detect different modes of contact forces due to their low sensitivity and data decoupling. Simultaneously conducting tactile and slip sensing presents significant challenges for the design, structure, and performance of sensors. In this work, a highly sensitive sandwich&#8208;structured sensor is achieved by exploiting the porosity and compressive modulus of the sensor's functional layer materials. The sensor shows an ultra&#8208;high sensitivity of 1167 kPa&#8722;1 and a low&#8208;pressure detection limit of 1.34&#160;Pa due to its considerably low compression modulus of 23.8&#160;Pa. Due to this ultra&#8208;high sensitivity, coupled with spectral analysis, it allows for dual&#8208;mode detection of both tactile and slip sensations simultaneously. This novel fabrication strategy and signal analysis method provides a new direction for the development of tactile/slip sensors.

         <title>Sensing, Imaging, and Therapeutic Strategies Endowing by Conjugate Polymers for Precision Medicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced conjugated polymers (CPs) are widely used in biomedical applications due to their excellent light absorption, high fluorescence quantum yield, and stability. This paper presents research advances in CPs for biological detection, imaging, therapeutics, and bio&#8208;electronic device fabrication. Through this review, it is hoped to provide cutting&#8208;edge information for basic research and clinical translation of CPs&#8208;based detection methods and technologies.








Abstract
Conjugated polymers (CPs) have promising applications in biomedical fields, such as disease monitoring, real&#8208;time imaging diagnosis, and disease treatment. As a promising luminescent material with tunable emission, high brightness and excellent stability, CPs are widely used as fluorescent probes in biological detection and imaging. Rational molecular design and structural optimization have broadened absorption/emission range of CPs, which are more conductive for disease diagnosis and precision therapy. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in the application of CPs, aiming to elucidate their structural and functional relationships. The fluorescence properties of CPs and the mechanism of detection signal amplification are first discussed, followed by an elucidation of their emerging applications in biological detection. Subsequently, CPs&#8208;based imaging systems and therapeutic strategies are illustrated systematically.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conjugated polymers (CPs) have promising applications in biomedical fields, such as disease monitoring, real-time imaging diagnosis, and disease treatment. As a promising luminescent material with tunable emission, high brightness and excellent stability, CPs are widely used as fluorescent probes in biological detection and imaging. Rational molecular design and structural optimization have broadened absorption/emission range of CPs, which are more conductive for disease diagnosis and precision therapy. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in the application of CPs, aiming to elucidate their structural and functional relationships. The fluorescence properties of CPs and the mechanism of detection signal amplification are first discussed, followed by an elucidation of their emerging applications in biological detection. Subsequently, CPs-based imaging systems and therapeutic strategies are illustrated systematically. Finally, recent advancements in utilizing CPs as electroactive materials for bioelectronic devices are also investigated. Moreover, the challenges and outlooks of CPs for precision medicine are discussed. Through this systematic review, it is hoped to highlight the frontier progress of CPs and promote new breakthroughs in fundamental research and clinical transformation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Green Printing for Scalable Organic Photovoltaic Modules by Controlling the Gradient Marangoni Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic effect of inward Marangoni flow generation and solution thickening caused by the cosolvent strategy can effectively restrain the Coffee&#8208;ring effect during the Hot Blade&#8208;Coating process, resulting in highly homogeneous green&#8208;printed large&#8208;area organic photovoltaics. 








Abstract
Despite the rapid development in the performances of organic solar cells (OSCs), high&#8208;performance OSC modules based on green printing are still limited. The severe Coffee&#8208;ring effect (CRE) is considered to be the primary reason for the nonuniform distribution of active layer films. To solve this key printing problem, the cosolvent strategy is presented to deposit the active layer films. The guest solvent Mesitylene with a higher boiling point and a lower surface tension is incorporated into the host solvent o&#8208;XY to optimize the rheological properties, such as surface tension and viscosity of the active layer solutions. And the synergistic effect of inward Marangoni flow generation and solution thickening caused by the cosolvent strategy can effectively restrain CRE, resulting in highly homogeneous large&#8208;area active layer films. In addition, the optimized crystallization and phase separation of active layer films effectively accelerate the charge transport and exciton dissociation of devices. Consequently, based on PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 system, the device prepared with the co&#8208;solvent strategy shows the a power conversion efficiency of 17.80%. Moreover, as the effective area scales to 1 and 16.94 cm2, the recorded performances are altered to 16.71% and 14.58%. This study provides a universal pathway for the development of green&#8208;printed high&#8208;efficiency organic photovoltaics.

         <title>Secondary Amines Functionalized Organocatalytic Iodine Redox for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The organocatalytic mechanism of secondary amine functionalized phenylamine&#8208;based conjugated microporous polymer (PA&#8208;CMP) cathode on iodine redox through H&#183;&#183;&#183;I bridging is systematically investigated. The I&#8722; anion based aqueous dual&#8208;ion battery demonstrates outstanding electrochemical performance with ultrahigh capacity of 730/516 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1/15 A g&#8722;1, ultralow overpotential of 47/129 mV at 1/15 A g&#8722;1, and stable long&#8208;term performance for over 5000 cycles.








Abstract
Aqueous dual&#8208;ion batteries (ADIBs) based on the cooperative redox of cations and iodine anions at the anode and cathode respectively, are attracting increasing interest because of high capacity and safety. However, the full&#8208;cell performance is limited by the sluggish iodine redox kinetics between iodide and polyiodide involving multiple electron transfer steps, and the undesirable shuttling effect of polyiodides. Here, this work reports a versatile conjugated microporous polymer functionalized with secondary amine groups as an organocatalytic cathode for ADIB, which can be positively charged and electrostatically adsorb iodide, and organocatalyze iodine redox reactions through the amine groups. Both theoretical calculations and controlled experiments confirm that the secondary amine groups confine (poly)iodide species via hydrogen bonding, which is essential for accelerating iodine redox kinetics and reducing the polyiodide shuttling effect. The ADIB achieves an ultrahigh capacity of 730 mAh g&#8722;1 with an ultrasmall overpotential of 47&#160;mV at 1 A g&#8722;1, which also exhibits excellent rate performance and long cycling stability with a capacity retention of 74% after 5000 cycles at a high current density of 5&#8201;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This work demonstrates the promise of developing organocatalysts for accelerating electrochemical processes, which remains a virtually unexplored area in electrocatalyst design for clean energy applications.

         <title>Black Arsenic Phosphorus Mid&#8208;Wave Infrared Barrier Detector with High Detectivity at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unipolar barrier detector allows for the flow of minority carrier current while effectively inhibiting the flow of majority carriers. The existence of a wide&#8208;bandgap barrier plays a crucial role in preventing Shockley&#8211;Reed&#8211;Hall current within the depletion region of photodiodes. Therefore, the barrier structure allows the passage of photocurrent, while effectively blocking dark current.








Abstract
The barrier structure is designed to enhance the operating temperature of the infrared detector, thereby improving the efficiency of collecting photogenerated carriers and reducing dark current generation, without suppressing the photocurrent. However, the development of barrier detectors using conventional materials is limited due to the strict requirements for lattice and band matching. In this study, a high&#8208;performance unipolar barrier detector is designed utilizing a black arsenic phosphorus/molybdenum disulfide/black phosphorus van der Waals heterojunction. The device exhibits a broad response bandwidth ranging from visible light to mid&#8208;wave infrared (520&#160;nm to 4.6 &#181;m), with a blackbody detectivity of 2.7&#160;&#215; 1010 cmHz&#8722;1/2 W&#8722;1 in the mid&#8208;wave infrared range at room temperature. Moreover, the optical absorption anisotropy of black arsenic phosphorus enables polarization resolution detection, achieving a polarization extinction ratio of 35.5 at 4.6 &#181;m. Mid&#8208;wave infrared imaging of the device is successfully demonstrated at room temperature, highlighting the significant potential of barrier devices based on van der Waals heterojunctions in mid&#8208;wave infrared detection.

         <title>Monolithic Strong Coupling of Topological Surface Acoustic Wave Resonators on Lithium Niobate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strong coupling of topological surface acoustic wave resonators with a large Rabi splitting and a high&#8208;quality factor operating at gigahertz frequencies based on a single&#8208;crystal lithium niobate acoustic&#8208;electric integrated system is realized. The coupling resonators are prepared by etching nanoscale grooves on the surface of lithium niobate. Then dense wavelength division multiplexers based on multiresonator coupling are also demonstrated.








Abstract
Coherent phonon transfer via high&#8208;quality factor (Q) mechanical resonator strong coupling has garnered significant interest. Yet, the practical applications of these strongly coupled resonator devices are largely constrained by their vulnerability to fabrication defects. In this study, topological strong coupling of gigahertz frequency surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonators with lithium niobate is achieved. The nanoscale grooves are etched onto the lithium niobate surface to establish robust SAW topological interface states (TISs). By constructing phononic crystal (PnC) heterostructures, a strong coupling of two SAW TISs, achieving a maximum Rabi splitting of 22&#160;MHz and frequency quality factor product fQm of &#8776;1.2 &#215; 1013&#160;Hz, is realized. This coupling can be tuned by adjusting geometric parameters and a distinct spectral anticrossing is experimentally observed. Furthermore, a dense wavelength division multiplexing device based on the coupling of multiple TISs is demonstrated. These findings open new avenues for the development of practical topological acoustic devices for on&#8208;chip sensing, filtering, phonon entanglement, and beyond.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

The surface crystallization modulation technique is introduced to fabricate the high&#8208;quality 2D perovskite films with both vertical crystal orientation and high phase purity by regulating the crystallization dynamics. The solvent atmosphere condition is instituted during film processing, which promotes the formation of an oriented 2D perovskite layer at the vapor&#8211;liquid interface and templates the subsequent film growth.








Abstract
2D perovskites have shown great potential toward stable and efficient photovoltaic devices. However, the crystal orientation and phase impurity issues of 2D perovskite films originating from the anisotropic crystal structure and specific growth mechanism have demoted their optoelectronic performances. Here, the surface crystallization modulation technique is introduced to fabricate the high&#8208;quality 2D perovskite films with both vertical crystal orientation and high phase purity by regulating the crystallization dynamics. The solvent atmosphere condition is instituted during film processing, which promotes the formation of an oriented 2D perovskite layer in stoichiometric composition at the vapor&#8211;liquid interface and templates the subsequent film growth. The solar cells based on the optimized 2D perovskite films exhibit a power conversion efficiency of 15.04%, the record for 2D perovskites (with the perovskite slab thickness n &#8804; 3 and high phase purity). The solar cells based on the highly&#8208;oriented and phase&#8208;pure 2D perovskite films also demonstrate excellent thermal and humidity stabilities.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Triggered Tunable Phosphorescence Lifetime of Graphene Quantum Dots in a Solid State</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the concept correlating the topological structure of precursors in &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; synthesis and the photoluminescent properties of carbon nanostructures, the relationships between the symmetry of precursors in &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; synthesis and structures/phosphorescence lifetimes of graphene quantum dots are revealed. Graphene quantum dots with ultralong phosphorescence lifetime (28.5 s) and visible phosphorescence emission (435&#8211;618 nm) are obtained.








Abstract
Studying the phosphorescent mechanisms of carbon nanostructures synthesized by the &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; approach is key to understanding the structure modulation and the interfacial properties of carbon nanostructures. In this work, the relationships among symmetry of precursors in the &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; synthesis, structures of products, and phosphorescence lifetimes of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) are studied. The symmetry matching of precursors in the formation of a D6h graphene&#8208;like framework is considered the key factor in controlling the separability of sp2 domains in GQDs. As the separability of sp2 domains in GQDs increases, the phosphorescence lifetimes (14.8&#8211;125.5&#160;ms) of GQDs in the solid state can be tuned. Machine learning is used to define the degree of disorder (S) of the GQD structure, which quantitatively describes the different space groups of precursors. The negative correlation between S and the oscillator strength of GQDs is uncovered. Therefore, S can be recognized as reflective of oscillator strength in the GQD structure. Finally, based on the correlations found between the structures and phosphorescence lifetimes of GQDs, GQDs with an ultralong phosphorescence lifetime (28.5&#160;s) are obtained. Moreover, GQDs with visible phosphorescence emission (435&#8211;618&#160;nm) are synthesized.

         <title>TiO2 Nano&#8208;Biopatterning Reveals Optimal Ligand Presentation for Cell&#8211;Matrix Adhesion Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dielectric nano&#8208;biopatterning technology is developed, enabling super&#8208;resolution fluorescence microscopy that is not possible for conventional plasmonic nanopatterns with quenching effects. Through simulations and experiments, the interactions between nanopatterns with adjacent fluorescence and surrounding lipid membranes are studied. It facilitates precise quantitative cell&#8208;biology studies to investigate molecular&#8208;scale signaling events in response to receptor clustering and their nanoscale organization.








Abstract
Nanoscale organization of transmembrane receptors is critical for cellular functions, enabled by the nanoscale engineering of bioligand presentation. Previously, a spatial threshold of &#8804;60&#160;nm for integrin binding ligands in cell&#8211;matrix adhesion is demonstrated using monoliganded gold nanoparticles. However, the ligand geometric arrangement is limited to hexagonal arrays of monoligands, while plasmonic quenching limits further investigation by fluorescence&#8208;based high&#8208;resolution imaging. Here, these limitations are overcome with dielectric TiO2 nanopatterns, eliminating fluorescence quenching, thus enabling super&#8208;resolution fluorescence microscopy on nanopatterns. By dual&#8208;color super&#8208;resolution imaging, high precision and consistency among nanopatterns, bioligands, and integrin nanoclusters are observed, validating the high quality and integrity of both nanopattern functionalization and passivation. By screening TiO2 nanodiscs with various diameters, an increase in fibroblast cell adhesion, spreading area, and Yes&#8208;associated protein (YAP) nuclear localization on 100 nm diameter compared with smaller diameters was observed. Focal adhesion kinase is identified as the regulatory signal. These findings explore the optimal ligand presentation when the minimal requirements are sufficiently fulfilled in the heterogenous extracellular matrix network of isolated binding regions with abundant ligands. Integration of high&#8208;fidelity nano&#8208;biopatterning with super&#8208;resolution imaging allows precise quantitative studies to address early signaling events in response to receptor clustering and their nanoscale organization.

         <title>A Catalyst&#8208;Like System Enables Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyclic reaction pathway in perovskite conversion facilitated by catalytic PbI2&#8208;mesylate anion complexes is explored. This approach yields a remarkably homogeneous perovskite film, resulting in a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 24.51% and excellent maximum&#8208;power&#8208;point&#8208;tracking stability in the corresponding perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
High&#8208;quality perovskite films are essential for achieving high performance of optoelectronic devices; However, solution&#8208;processed perovskite films are known to suffer from compositional and structural inhomogeneity due to lack of systematic control over the kinetics during the formation. Here, the microscopic homogeneity of perovskite films is successfully enhanced by modulating the conversion reaction kinetics using a catalyst&#8208;like system generated by a foaming agent. The chemical and structural evolution during this catalytic conversion is revealed by a multimodal synchrotron toolkit with spatial resolutions spanning many length scales. Combining these insights with computational investigations, a cyclic conversion pathway model is developed that yields exceptional perovskite homogeneity due to enhanced conversion, having a power conversion efficiency of 24.51% for photovoltaic devices. This work establishes a systematic link between processing of precursor and homogeneity of the perovskite films.

         <title>Near&#8208;Zero Energy Consumption Capacitors by Controlling Inhomogeneous Polarization Configuration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;zero energy loss with a record&#8208;high efficiency of &#8776;97.4% and a maximum figure of merit of 330 are realized in BaTiO3&#8208;based lead&#8208;free ceramic capacitors by aliovalent strongly polar double ion design to control inhomogeneous polarization configuration with multiple symmetries and polarization magnitudes, giving a giant recoverable energy storage density of &#8776;11.6 J cm&#8722;3 with an ultrahigh efficiency of &#8776;96.1%.








Abstract
Taking into account the need for energy conservation, achieving near&#8208;zero energy loss, namely ultrahigh efficiency (&#951;), in energy storage capacitors with large recoverable energy storage density (Wrec) plays an important role in applications, which is one of the major challenges in dielectric energy storage field. Here, guided by phase&#8208;field simulation, inhomogeneous polarization configuration with multiple symmetries and polarization magnitudes is controlled through aliovalent strongly polar double ion design to establish a strongly disordered state. A record&#8208;high &#951; of &#8776;97.4% is realized in lead&#8208;free relaxors with a large Wrec of &#8776;8.6 J cm&#8722;3, which also give a giant Wrec of &#8776;11.6 J cm&#8722;3 with an ultrahigh &#951; of &#8776;96.1% through high&#8208;energy ball milling, showing a breakthrough progress in ceramic capacitors with a maximum figure of merit of 330. This work demonstrates that controlling inhomogeneous polarization configuration is an effective avenue to develop new high&#8208;performance near&#8208;zero energy loss energy storage capacitors.

         <title>Emerging&#8239;Strategies for the Synthesis of Correlated Single Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the research status and synthetic challenges in correlated single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are showcased. Existing strategies, such as the regulation of nucleation kinetics, nanoscale confinement, defect&#8208;assisted metal trapping, precise control via ligand chemistry, and stepwise deposition, are highlighted. A complementary perspective on emerging methods is provided for high throughput screening and upscaling toward the next&#8208;stage catalyst production.








Abstract
People have been looking for an energy&#8208;efficient and sustainable method to produce future chemicals for decades. Heterogeneous single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with atomic dispersion of robust, well&#8208;characterized active centers are highly desirable. In particular, correlated SACs with cooperative interaction between adjacent single atoms allow the switching of the single&#8208;site pathway to the dual or multisite pathway, thus promoting bimolecular or more complex reactions for the synthesis of fine chemicals. Herein, the structural uniqueness of correlated SACs, including the intermetal distance and electronic interaction in homo/heteronuclear metal sites is featured. Recent advances in the production methods of correlated SACs, showcasing the research status and challenges in traditional methods (such as pyrolysis, wet impregnation, and confined synthesis) for building a comprehensive multimetallic SAC library, are summarized. Emerging strategies such as process automation and continuous&#8208;flow synthesis are highlighted, minimizing the inconsistency in laboratory batch production and allowing high throughput screening and upscaling toward the next&#8208;stage chemical production by correlated SACs.

         <title>Strontium&#8208;Containing Piezoelectric Biofilm Promotes Dentin Tissue Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a strontium&#8208;containing P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) film is fabricated to create the electrical microenvironment in dentin defects. The piezoelectric biofilm provides surface electrical potential to induce DPSC odonto&#8208;differentiation and the release of strontium ions, both effects of which contribute to endogenous dentin tissue regeneration.








Abstract
It remains an obstacle to induce the regeneration of hard dentin tissue in clinical settings. To overcome this, a P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) piezoelectric film with 2 wt% SrCl2 addition is designed. The biofilm shows a high flexibility, a harmonious biocompatibility, and a large piezoelectric d33 coefficient of 14 pC N&#8722;1, all contributing to building an electric microenvironment that favor the recruitment of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) and their differentiation into odontoblasts during normal chewing, speaking, etc. On the other hand, the strontium ions can be gradually released from the film, thus promoting DPSC odonto&#8208;differentiation. In vivo experiments also demonstrate that the film induces the release of dentin minerals and regeneration of dentin tissue. In the large animal dentin defect models, this piezoelectric film induces in situ dentin tissue formation effectively over a period of three months. This study illustrates a therapeutic potential of the piezoelectric film to improve dentin tissue repair in clinical settings.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Assisted Generation and Straight Movement of Skyrmion Bubble in Kagome TbMn6Sn6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Topological magnetic textures are promising candidates as binary data units for the next&#8208;generation memory device. The precise generation and convenient control of nontrivial spin topology at zero field near room temperature endows the critical advantages in skyrmionic devices but has not been simultaneously integrated into one material. Here, in the Kagome plane of quantum TbMn6Sn6, we report the expedient generation of the skyrmion bubbles in versatile forms of lattice, chain and isolated one by converging the electron beam, where the electron intensity gradient contributes to the dynamic generation from local anisotropy variation near spin reorientation transition (SRT). Encouragingly, by utilizing the dynamic shift of SRT domain interface, the straight movement is actualized with skyrmion bubble slaved to SRT domain interface forming an elastic composite object, avoiding the usual deflection from the skyrmion Hall effect. The critical contribution of the SRT domain interface via convenient electron&#8208;assisted heating source is further theoretically validated via micromagnetic simulation, highlighting the compatible application possibility in advanced device.

         <title>Efficient Dual Mechanisms Boost the Efficiency of Ternary Solar Cells with Two Compatible Polymer Donors to Exceed 19%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ternary strategy has attracted tremendous interest due to its versatile advantages for improving the performance of organic solar cells. In this work, two polymer donors based ternary organic solar cells are prepared to achieve both high power conversion efficiency (over 19%) and long thermal stability. This study proposes the collaborative regulation of two critical driving forces mechanisms for constructing high&#8208;performance ternary organic solar cells.








Abstract
Ternary strategyopens a simple avenue to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). The introduction of wide bandgap polymer donors (PDs) as third component canbetter utilize sunlight and&#160;improve the mechanical and thermal stability of active layer. However, efficient ternary OSCs (TOSCs) with two PDs are rarely reported due to inferior compatibility and shortage of efficient PDs match with acceptors. Herein, two PDs&#8208;(PBB&#8208;F and PBB&#8208;Cl) are adopted in the dual&#8208;PDs ternary systems to explore the underlying mechanisms and improve their photovoltaic performance. The findings demonstrate that the third components exhibit excellent miscibility with PM6 and are embedded in the host donor to form alloy&#8208;like phase. A more profound mechanism for enhancing efficiency through dual mechanisms, that are the guest energy transfer to PM6 and charge transport at the donor/acceptor interface, has been proposed. Consequently, the PM6:PBB&#8208;Cl:BTP&#8208;eC9 TOSCs achieve PCE of over 19%. Furthermore, the TOSCs exhibit better thermal stability than that of binary OSCs due to the reduction in spatial site resistance resulting from a more tightly entangled long&#8208;chain structure. This work not only provides an effective approach to fabricate high&#8208;performance TOSCs, but also demonstrates the importance of developing dual compatible PD materials.

         <title>Approaching Standardization: Mechanical Material Testing of Macroscopic Two&#8208;Photon Polymerized Specimens</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adaptive resolution two&#8208;photon polymerization (2PP) enables the production of macroscopic test specimens. By combining conventional testing methods and micromaterial testing, in&#8208;depth characterization of mechanical, thermo&#8208;mechanical, and fracture properties of 2PP materials is possible. This study reveals that 2PP delivers highly crosslinked polymers immediately after 3D printing, without the need of postprocessing at both micro and macroscale.








Abstract
Two&#8208;photon polymerization (2PP) is becoming increasingly established as additive manufacturing technology for microfabrication due to its high&#8208;resolution and the feasibility of generating complex parts. Until now, the high resolution of 2PP is also its bottleneck, as it limited throughput and therefore restricted the application to the production of microparts. Thus, mechanical properties of 2PP materials can only be characterized using nonstandardized specialized microtesting methods. Due to recent advances in 2PP technology, it is now possible to produce parts in the size of several millimeters to even centimeters, finally permitting the fabrication of macrosized testing specimens. Besides suitable hardware systems, 2PP materials exhibiting favorable mechanical properties that allow printing of up&#8208;scaled parts are strongly demanded. In this work, the up&#8208;scalability of three different photopolymers is investigated using a high&#8208;throughput 2PP system and low numerical aperture optics. Testing specimens in the cm&#8208;range are produced and tested with common or even standardized material testing methods available in conventionally equipped polymer testing labs. Examples of the characterization of mechanical, thermo&#8208;mechanical, and fracture properties of 2PP processed materials are shown. Additionally, aspects such as postprocessing and aging are investigated. This lays a foundation for future expansion of the 2PP technology to broader industrial application.

During intravesical treatment, Bacillus Calmette&#8211;Gu&#233;rin (BCG) facilitates the tumor&#8208;targeted delivery of doxorubicin (DOX) nanoparticles. Subsequently, the released DOX induces both chemotherapeutic and immunogenic tumor cell death, thereby releasing additional damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns. This synergistic interaction between DOX and BCG contributes to the establishment of antitumor immunity, ultimately achieving a comprehensive intravesical therapy of bladder cancer.








Abstract
Intravesical Bacillus Calmette&#8211;Gu&#233;rin (BCG) is a well&#8208;established strategy for managing high&#8208;risk nonmuscle&#8208;invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC); however, over half of patients still experience disease recurrence or progression. Although the combined intravesical instillation of various chemotherapeutic drugs is implemented in clinical trials to enhance the BCG therapy, the outcome is far from satisfying due to severe irritative effects and treatment intolerance at high doses. Therefore, it is adopted the &#8220;biotin&#8211;streptavidin strategy&#8221; to doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;encapsulated nanoparticles within live BCG bacteria (DOX@BCG) to improve treatment outcomes. Adherence of BCG to the bladder epithelium helps precisely target DOX@BCG to the local tumor cells and simultaneously increases intratumoral transport of therapeutic drugs. DOX@BCG effectively inhibits cancer progression and prolongs the survival of rats/mice with orthotopic bladder cancer owing to synergism between BCG&#8208;immunotherapy, DOX&#8208;chemotherapy, and DOX&#8208;induced immunogenic tumor cell death; furthermore, it exhibits improved tolerance and biosafety, and establishes antitumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment. Therefore, the drug&#8208;loaded live BCG bacterial delivery system holds considerable potential for clinical translation in the intravesical treatment of bladder cancer.

         <title>Molecular Engineering Enables Hydrogel Electrolyte with Ionic Hopping Migration and Self&#8208;Healability toward Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular engineering strategy is presented to introduce oxygen&#8208;rich poly(urea&#8208;urethane) (OR&#8208;PUU) into polyacrylamide (PAM)&#8208;based (OR&#8208;PUU/PAM) hydrogel electrolytes. Benefiting from their high ionic conductivity, desolvation effect, ionic hopping migration, and self&#8208;healability, the resulting Zn symmetric cell exhibits prominent cycling stability. This work provides meaningful guidance for the development of high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;based hydrogel electrolytes.








Abstract
Hydrogel electrolytes (HEs), characterized by intrinsic safety, mechanical stability, and biocompatibility, can promote the development of flexible aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (FAZIBs). However, current FAZIB technology is severely restricted by the uncontrollable dendrite growth arising from undesirable reactions between the HEs with sluggish ionic conductivity and Zn metal. To overcome this challenge, this work proposes a molecular engineering strategy, which involves the introduction of oxygen&#8208;rich poly(urea&#8208;urethane) (OR&#8208;PUU) into polyacrylamide (PAM)&#8208;based HEs. The OR&#8208;PUU/PAM HEs facilitate rapid ion transfer through their ionic hopping migration mechanism, resulting in uniform and orderly Zn2+ deposition. The abundant polar groups on the OR&#8208;PUU molecules in OR&#8208;PUU/PAM HEs break the inherent H&#8208;bond network, tune the solvation structure of hydrated Zn2+, and inhibit the occurrence of side reactions. Moreover, the interaction of hierarchical H&#8208;bonds in the OR&#8208;PUU/PAM HEs endows them with self&#8208;healability, enabling in situ repair of cracks induced by plating/stripping. Consequently, Zn symmetric cells incorporating the novel OR&#8208;PUU/PAM HEs exhibit a long cycling life of 2000&#160;h. The resulting Zn&#8211;MnO2 battery displays a low capacity decay rate of 0.009% over 2000 cycles at 2000&#160;mA g&#8722;1. Overall, this work provides valuable insights to facilitate the realization of dendrite&#8208;free Zn&#8208;metal anodes through the molecular engineering of HEs.

         <title>3D Crown Ether Covalent Organic Framework as Interphase Layer toward High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D covalent organic framework as protecting layer accelerates Li+ diffusion kinetics, enables stable Li deposition at high current density and capacity, and sheds new light on fabricating interphase layers and inspires the further development of high&#8208;performance batteries.








Abstract
The practical application of lithium (Li) metal batteries is inhibited by accumulative Li dendrites and continuous active Li consumption during cycling, which results in a low Coulombic efficiency and short lifetime. Constructing artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer in Li anode, such as 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs), is an effective strategy to restrain the formation of Li dendrites and improve cycling performance. However, the exploration of 3D COFs as protecting layers is rarely reported, because of the preconception that the interconnect pores in 3D COFs eventually cause Li dendrites in disordered direction. 3D crown ether&#8208;based COF with ffc topology as interphase layer, in which the crown ether units are arranged in parallel and vertical orientation along the electrode, is demonstrated. The strong coupling effect between the crown ether and Li+ accelerates Li+ diffusion kinetics and enables homogeneous Li+ flux, resulting in a high Li+ transference number of 0.85 and smooth Li deposition in 3D direction. Li/COF&#8208;Cu cells display a lower Li&#8208;nucleation overpotential (17.4&#160;mV) and high average Coulombic efficiency of &#8776;98.6% during 340 cycles with COF incorporation. This work gives a new insight into designing COFs for energy storage systems.

         <title>Tough Hydro&#8208;Aerogels with Cation Specificity Enabled Ultra&#8208;High Stability for Multifunctional Sensing and Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte Applications</title>

         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;step strategy is exploited to realize the gels with cation specificity. The hydro&#8208;aerogels with the cationic salting&#8208;out effect exhibit promising applications in flexible sensors to effectively monitor human motion, humidity, and marine environment parameters, while the hydro&#8208;aerogels with the cationic salting&#8208;in effect or without borax pretreatment can serve as quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes in supercapacitors with excellent stability.








Abstract
The anion&#8208;specific effects of the salting&#8208;in and salting&#8208;out phenomena are extensively observed in hydrogels, whereas the cation specificity of hydrogels is rarely reported. Herein, a multi&#8208;step strategy including borax pre&#8208;gelation, saline soaking, freeze&#8208;drying, and rehydrating is developed to fabricate polyvinyl alcohol gels with cation specificity, exhibiting the specific ordering of effects on the mechanical properties of gels as Ca2+ &gt; Li+ &gt; Mg2+ &gt;&gt; Fe3+ &gt; Cu2+ &gt;&gt; Co2+ &#8776; Ni2+ &#8776; Zn2+. The multiple effects of the fabrication strategy, including the electrostatic repulsion among cations, skeleton support function of graphene oxide nanosheets, and water absorption and retention of ions, endow the gels with the dual characteristics of hydrogels and aerogels (i.e., hydro&#8208;aerogels). The hydro&#8208;aerogels prepared with the cationic salting&#8208;out effect display attractive pressure sensing performance with excellent stability over 90 days and enable continuous monitoring of ambient humidity in real&#8208;time and effective work in seawater to detect various parameters (e.g., depth, salinity, and temperature). The hydro&#8208;aerogels prepared without borax pretreatment or using the cationic salting&#8208;in effect can serve as quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes in supercapacitors, with 99.59% capacitance retention after 10&#160;000 cycles. This study realizes cation specificity in hydrogels and designs multifunctional hydro&#8208;aerogels for promising applications in various fields.

         <title>Biomimetic Multimodal Receptors for Comprehensive Artificial Human Somatosensory System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible multimodal receptor can achieve a reversible transformation from 2D to 3D structure by bending or stretching the sensor, drawing inspiration from the morphological switch observed in the hummingbird feathers. Interestingly, a single&#8208;unit receptor is capable of sensing multiple stimuli, including in&#8208;plane deformation (pressure and bending), out&#8208;of&#8208;plane deformation (force and airflow), temperature, and humidity.








Abstract
Electronic skin (e&#8208;skin) capable of acquiring environmental and physiological information has attracted interest for healthcare, robotics, and human&#8211;machine interaction. However, traditional 2D e&#8208;skin only allows for in&#8208;plane force sensing, which limits access to comprehensive stimulus feedback due to the lack of out&#8208;of&#8208;plane signal detection caused by its 3D structure. Here, a dimension&#8208;switchable bioinspired receptor is reported to achieve multimodal perception by exploiting film kirigami. It offers the detection of in&#8208;plane (pressure and bending) and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (force and airflow) signals by dynamically inducing the opening and reclosing of sensing unit. The receptor's hygroscopic and thermoelectric properties enable the sensing of humidity and temperature. Meanwhile, the thermoelectric receptor can differentiate mechanical stimuli from temperature by the voltage. The development enables a wide range of sensory capabilities of traditional e&#8208;skin and expands the applications in real life.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronic skin (e-skin) capable of acquiring environmental and physiological information has attracted interest for healthcare, robotics, and human&#8211;machine interaction. However, traditional 2D e-skin only allows for in-plane force sensing, which limits access to comprehensive stimulus feedback due to the lack of out-of-plane signal detection caused by its 3D structure. Here, a dimension-switchable bioinspired receptor is reported to achieve multimodal perception by exploiting film kirigami. It offers the detection of in-plane (pressure and bending) and out-of-plane (force and airflow) signals by dynamically inducing the opening and reclosing of sensing unit. The receptor's hygroscopic and thermoelectric properties enable the sensing of humidity and temperature. Meanwhile, the thermoelectric receptor can differentiate mechanical stimuli from temperature by the voltage. The development enables a wide range of sensory capabilities of traditional e-skin and expands the applications in real life.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamically Reconstructed Triple&#8208;Copper&#8208;Vacancy Associates Confined in Cu Nanowires Enabling High&#8208;Rate and Selective CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products</title>

         <dc:description>
Triple&#8208;copper&#8208;vacancy associates are first constructed through electroreduction of Cu&#8208;based nanowires, demonstrated by positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy and high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy image. In situ attenuated total reflection&#8208;surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy and density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory calculations disclose the triple&#8208;copper&#8208;vacancy associates endow the nearby Cu sites with enriched and disparate local charge density, which favor *CO adsorption and dimerization.








Abstract
Electrochemically reconstructed Cu&#8208;based catalysts always exhibit enhanced CO2&#160;electroreduction performance; however, it still remains ambiguous whether the reconstructed Cu vacancies have a substantial impact on CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ reactivity. Herein, Cu vacancies are first constructed through electrochemical reduction of Cu&#8208;based nanowires, in which high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy image manifests the formation of triple&#8208;copper&#8208;vacancy associates with different concentrations, confirmed by positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy. In situ attenuated total reflection&#8208;surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy discloses the triple&#8208;copper&#8208;vacancy associates favor *CO adsorption and fast *CO dimerization. Moreover, density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory calculations unravel the triple&#8208;copper&#8208;vacancy associates endow the nearby Cu sites with enriched and disparate local charge density, which enhances the *CO adsorption and reduces the CO&#8211;CO coupling barrier, affirmed by the decreased *CO dimerization energy barrier by 0.4&#160;eV. As a result, the triple&#8208;copper&#8208;vacancy associates confined in Cu nanowires achieve a high Faradaic efficiency of over 80% for C2+ products in a wide current density range of 400&#8211;800&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, outperforming most reported Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts.

         <title>Controllable Manipulation of Large&#8208;Volume Droplet on Non&#8208;slippery Surfaces based on Triboelectric Contactless Charge Injection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Controllable droplet manipulation is crucial in diverse scientific and engineering fields. Traditional electric&#8208;based methods usually rely on commercial high&#8208;voltage (HV) power sources, which are typically bulky, expensive, and potentially hazardous. The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is a highly studied device that can generate HV output with limited current, showing great potential in droplet manipulation applications. However, current TENG&#8208;based approaches usually utilize traditional free&#8208;standing TENGs that produce short&#8208;pulsed alternating&#8208;current signals. This limitation hinders continuous electrostatic forces necessary for precise droplet control, leading to complex circuitry and suboptimal droplet motion control in terms of volume, distance, direction, and momentum. Here, we propose a triboelectric contactless charge injection (TCCI) method employing a novel dual&#8208;functional triboelectric nanogenerator (DF&#8208;TENG). The DF&#8208;TENG can produce both high voltage and constant current during unidirectional motion, enabling continuous corona discharges for contactless charge injection into the droplets. Using this method, a large&#8208;volume droplet (3000 &#956;L) can be controlled with momentum up to 115.2 g mm s&#8722;1, quintupling the highest value recorded by the traditional methods. Moreover, the TCCI method is adaptable for a variety of non&#8208;slippery substrates and droplets of different compositions and viscosities, which makes it an ideal manipulation strategy for droplet transport, chemical reactions, and even driving solids.

         <title>Tailless Information&#8208;Energy Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Programmable metasurface technology can achieve flexible manipulations of electromagnetic waves in real time by adjusting the surface structure and material properties, and has shown extraordinary potentials in many fields such as wireless communications and Internet of Things. However, most of the programmable metasurfaces have a common feature: a tail (electrical wires and DC powers), which is difficult to supply in some particular application scenarios such as canyons and mountains. To eliminate the limitation of DC power supply, we combine the programmable metasurface and wireless power transfer technology to propose a tailless information&#8208;energy metasurface (IEMS). The tailless IEMS platform can dynamically control electromagnetic waves without relying on an external DC power supply; instead, the required DC power is provided internally by the IEMS platform itself. In the tailless IEMS experiments, we have demonstrated our concept through the dynamic regulation of wireless channels and the wireless transmission of DC power. Our work provides a self&#8208;powered method for the programmable metasurfaces, expands the application scenarios, facilitates the miniaturization of systems, and makes it easy to integrate with other systems.

         <title>A PROTAC Augmenter for Photo&#8208;driven Pyroptosis in Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) has recently emerged as a promising strategy for inducing post&#8208;translational knockdown of target proteins in disease treatment. The degradation of bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4 (BRD4), an essential nuclear protein for gene transcription, induced by PROTAC has been proposed as an epigenetic approach to treat breast cancer. However, the poor membrane permeability and indiscriminate distribution of PROTAC in vivo results in low bioavailability, limiting its development and application. Herein, we developed a nano &#8220;targeting chimera&#8221; (abbreviated as L@NBMZ) consisting of BRD4&#8208;PROTAC combined with a photosensitizer, to serve as the first augmenter for photo&#8208;driven pyroptosis in breast cancer. With excellent BRD4 degradation ability, high biosafety, and biocompatibility, L@NBMZ blocked gene transcription by degrading BRD4 through proteasomes in vivo, and surprisingly, induced the cleavage of caspase&#8208;3. This type of caspase&#8208;3 cleavage was synergistically amplified by light irradiation in the presence of photosensitizers, leading to efficient photo&#8208;driven pyroptosis. Both in vitro and in vivo outcomes demonstrated the remarkable anti&#8208;cancer efficacy of this augmenter, which significantly inhibitd the lung metastasis of breast cancer in vivo. Thus, the photo&#8208;PROTAC &#8220;targeting chimera&#8221; augmenter construction strategy may pave a new way for expanding PROTAC applications within anti&#8208;cancer paradigms.

         <title>Skin&#8208;inspired Multi&#8208;Modal Mechanoreceptors for Dynamic Haptic Exploration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Active sensing is a fundamental aspect of human and animal interactions with the environment, providing essential information about the hardness, texture, and tackiness of objects. This ability stems from the presence of diverse mechanoreceptors in our skin, capable of detecting a wide range of stimuli and from the sensorimotor control of biological mechanism. In contrast, existing tactile sensors for robotic applications typically excel in identifying only limited types of information, lacking the versatility of biological mechanoreceptors and the requisite sensing strategies to extract tactile information proactively. Here, inspired by human haptic perception, we develop a skin&#8208;inspired artificial 3D mechanoreceptor (SENS) capable of detecting multiple mechanical stimuli to bridge sensing and action in a closed&#8208;loop sensorimotor system for dynamic haptic exploration. A tensor&#8208;based non&#8208;linear theoretical model is established to characterize the 3D deformation (e.g., tensile, compressive and shear deformation) of SENS, providing guidance for the design and optimization of multimode sensing properties with high fidelity. Based on SENS, we further demonstrate a closed&#8208;loop robotic system capable of recognizing objects with improved accuracy (&#8764;96%). This dynamic haptic exploration approach shows promise for a wide range of applications such as autonomous learning, healthcare, and space and deep&#8208;sea exploration.

         <title>Inhibiting the Keap1/Nrf2 Protein&#8208;Protein Interaction with Protein&#8208;Like Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The protein&#8208;protein interaction between Kelch&#8208;like ECH associating protein 1&#160;(Keap1) and nuclear factor erthroid 2&#8208;related factor 2 (Nrf2) regulates the antioxidant response. Protein&#8208;like polymers (PLPs) were developed to inhibit the Keap1/Nrf2 PPI as multivalent, stable, and bioactive compounds. The polymers overcome prior limitations and&#160;serve as both a chemical biology tool and foundation for Keap1/Nrf2 targeted therapeutics.








Abstract
Successful and selective inhibition of the cytosolic protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI) between nuclear factor erythroid 2&#8208;related factor 2 (Nrf2) and Kelch&#8208;like ECH&#8208;associating protein 1 (Keap1) can enhance the antioxidant response, with the potential for a therapeutic effect in a range of settings including in neurodegenerative disease (ND). Small molecule inhibitors have been developed, yet many have off&#8208;target effects, or are otherwise limited by poor cellular permeability. Peptide&#8208;based strategies have also been attempted to enhance specificity, yet face challenges due to susceptibility to degradation and lack of cellular penetration. Herein, these barriers are overcome utilizing a polymer&#8208;based proteomimetics. The protein&#8208;like polymer (PLP) consists of a synthetic, lipophilic polymer backbone displaying water soluble Keap1&#8208;binding peptides on each monomer unit forming a brush polymer architecture. The PLPs are capable of engaging Keap1 and displacing the cellular protective transcription factor Nrf2, which then translocates to the nucleus, activating the antioxidant response element (ARE). PLPs exhibit increased Keap1 binding affinity by several orders of magnitude compared to free peptides, maintain serum stability, are cell&#8208;penetrant, and selectively activate the ARE pathway in cells, including in primary cortical neuronal cultures. Keap1/Nrf2&#8208;inhibitory PLPs have the potential to impact the treatment of disease states associated with dysregulation of oxidative stress, such as NDs.

         <title>Enhancing Stability and Efficiency of Inverted Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells with in&#8208;situ Interfacial Cross&#8208;linked Modifier</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Inverted inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) hold the potential as the top cell in tandem configurations, owning to the ideal bandgap, good thermal and light stability of inorganic perovskites. However, challenges such as mismatch of energy levels between charge transport layer and perovskite, significant non&#8208;radiative recombination caused by surface defects, and poor water stability have led to the urgent need for further improvement in the performance of inverted inorganic PSCs. Herein, we report the fabrication of efficient and stable CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx PSCs through surface treatment of (3&#8208;mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane (MPTS). The silane groups in MPTS can in&#8208;situ crosslink in the presence of moisture to build a 3 dimensional network by Si&#8208;O&#8208;Si bonds, which forms a hydrophobic layer on perovskite surface to inhibit water invasion. Additionally, &#8208;SH can strongly interact with the undercoordinated Pb2+ at the perovskite surface, effectively minimizing interfacial charge recombination. Consequently, the efficiency of the inverted inorganic PSCs improves dramatically from 19.0% to 21.0% under 100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 illumination with MPTS treatment. Remarkably, perovskite films with crosslinked MPTS exhibits superior stability when soaking in water. The optimized PSC maintains 91% of its initial efficiency after aging 1000&#160;h in ambient atmosphere, and 86% in 800&#160;h of operational stability testing.

Abstract
As the photovoltaic field endeavors to transition perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to industrial applications, inverted PSCs, which incorporate fullerene as electron transport layers, have emerged as a compelling choice due to their augmented stability and cost effectiveness. However, these attributes suffer from performance issues stemming from suboptimal electrical characteristics at the perovskite/fullerene interface. To surmount these hurdles, we propose an interface bridging strategy (IBS) to attenuate the interface energy loss and enhance the interfacial stability by designing a series of A&#8208;D&#8208;A type perylene monoimide (PMI) derivatives with multifaceted advantages. In addition to passivating defects, the IBS plays a crucial role in facilitating the binding between perovskite and fullerene, thereby enhancing interface coupling and importantly, improving the formation of fullerene films. The PMI derivatives, functioning as bridges, serve as a protective barrier to enhance the device stability. Consequently, the IBS enables a remarkable efficiency of 24.62% for lab&#8208;scale PSCs and an efficiency of 18.73% for perovskite solar modules crafted on 156 &#215; 156 mm2 substrates. The obtained efficiencies represent some of the highest recorded for fullerene&#8208;based devices, showcasing significant progress in designing interfacial molecules at the perovskite/fullerene interface and offering a promising path to enhance the commercial viability of PSCs.

         <title>Efficient Thermal Management with Selective Metamaterial Absorber for Boosting Photothermal CO2 Hydrogenation under Sunlight</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient sunlight&#8208;driven catalytic CO2 hydrogenation is achieved by thermal management with designed selective metamaterial absorber. The design enables to achieve an extraordinary CO2 conversion rate of 516.9&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under a relative mild&#8208;intensity light irradiation at 0.8&#160;W cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Photothermal catalytic CO2 hydrogenation is a prospective strategy to simultaneously reduce CO2 emission and generate value&#8208;added fuels. However, the demand of extremely intense light hinders its development in practical applications. Herein, this work reports the novel design of Ni&#8208;based selective metamaterial absorber and employs it as the photothermal catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation. The selective absorption property reduces the heat loss caused by radiation while possessing effectively solar absorption, thus substantially increasing local photothermal temperature. Notably, the enhancement of local electric field by plasmon resonance promotes the adsorption and activation of reactants. Moreover, benefiting from the ingenious morphology that Ni nanoparticles (NPs)&#160;are encapsulated by SiO2 matrix through co&#8208;sputtering, the greatly improved dispersion of Ni NPs enables enhancing the contact with reaction gas and preventing the agglomeration. Consequently, the catalyst exhibits an unprecedented CO2 conversion rate of 516.9&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under 0.8&#160;W cm&#8722;2 irradiation, with near 90% CO selectivity and high stability. Significantly, this designed photothermal catalyst demonstrates the great potential in practical applications under sunlight. This work provides new sights for designing high&#8208;performance photothermal catalysts by thermal management.

Abstract
Immunotherapy represents a revolutionary paradigm in cancer management, showcasing its potential to impede tumor metastasis and recurrence. Nonetheless, challenges including limited therapeutic efficacy and severe immune&#8208;related side effects are frequently encountered, especially in solid tumors. Hydrogels, a class of versatile materials featuring well&#8208;hydrated structures widely used in biomedicine, offer a promising platform for encapsulating and releasing small molecule drugs, biomacromolecules, and cells in a controlled manner. Immunomodulatory hydrogels present unique capability for augmenting immune activation and mitigating systemic toxicity through encapsulation of multiple components and localized administration. Notably, hydrogels based on biopolymers have gained significant interest owing to their biocompatibility, environmental friendliness, and ease of production. This review delves into the recent advances in bio&#8208;based hydrogels in cancer immunotherapy and synergistic combinatorial approaches, highlighting their diverse applications. We anticipate that this review will guide the rational design of hydrogels in the field of cancer immunotherapy, fostering clinical translation and ultimately benefiting patients.

         <title>Bioengineered Ionic Liquid for Catheter&#8208;Directed Tissue Ablation, Drug Delivery, and Embolization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catheter&#8208;directed ILE is bioengineered and tested in animal models of embolization, outperforming the clinically used embolic agents. ILE represents a new class of liquid embolic agents that can treat tumors, achieving chemical segmentectomy, improving the delivery of therapeutics, preventing infectious complications, and potentially increasing chemo&#8208; and immunotherapy response in solid tumors.








Abstract
Delivery of therapeutics to solid tumors with high bioavailability remains a challenge and is likely the main contributor to the ineffectiveness of immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Here, a catheter&#8208;directed ionic liquid embolic (ILE) is bioengineered to achieve durable vascular embolization, uniform tissue ablation, and drug delivery in non&#8208;survival and survival porcine models of embolization, outperforming the clinically used embolic agents. To simulate the clinical scenario, rabbit VX2 orthotopic liver tumors are treated showing successful trans&#8208;arterial delivery of Nivolumab and effective tumor ablation. Furthermore, similar results are also observed in human ex vivo tumor tissue as well as significant susceptibility of highly resistant patient&#8208;derived bacteria is seen to ILE, suggesting that ILE can prevent abscess formation in embolized tissue. ILE represents a new class of liquid embolic agents that can treat tumors, improve the delivery of therapeutics, prevent infectious complications, and potentially increase chemo&#8208; and immunotherapy response in solid tumors.

         <title>In Situ&#8208;Sprayed Bioinspired Adhesive Conductive Hydrogels for Cavernous Nerve Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a bioinspired nucleobase adhesion strategy is proposed to design an adhesive conductive hydrogel spray with immunomodulatory, and endoscopic delivery convenience for cavernous nerve repair. The feasibility and validity of sprayable hydrogel in minimally invasive surgery is verified through the use of a beagle model. The results reveal the great potential of sprayable conductive hydrogel materials as next&#8208;generation minimally invasive nerve repair materials.








Abstract
Cavernous nerve injury (CNI), resulting in erectile dysfunction (ED), poses a significant threat to the quality of life for men. Strategies utilizing conductive hydrogels have demonstrated promising results for the treatment of peripheral nerves with a large diameter (&gt;2&#160;mm). However, integrating convenient minimally invasive operation, antiswelling and immunomodulatory conductive hydrogels for treating small&#8208;diameter injured cavernous nerves remains a great challenge. Here, a sprayable adhesive conductive hydrogel (GACM) composed of gelatin, adenine, carbon nanotubes, and mesaconate designed for cavernous nerve repair is developed. Multiple hydrogen bonds provide GACM with excellent adhesive and antiswelling properties, enabling it to establish a conformal electrical bridge with the damaged nerve and aiding in the regeneration process. Additionally, mesaconate&#8208;loaded GACM suppresses the release of inflammatory factors by macrophages and promotes the migration and proliferation of Schwann cells. In vivo tests demonstrate that the GACM hydrogel repairs the cavernous nerve and restores erectile function and fertility. Furthermore, the feasibility of sprayable GACM in minimally invasive robotic surgery in beagles is validated. Given the benefits of therapeutic effectiveness and clinical convenience, the research suggests a promising future for sprayable GACM materials as advanced solutions for minimally invasive nerve repair.

Abstract
Flexible photo&#8208;thermoelectric (PTE) devices have great application prospects in the fields of solar energy conversion and ultra&#8208;broadband light detection, etc. A suitable manufacturing process to avoid the substrate effects as well as to create a narrow transition area between p&#8208;n modules for high&#8208;performance free&#8208;standing flexible PTE devices is highly desired. Herein, we reported an automated laser fabrication (ALF) method to construct the PTE devices with low&#8208;cost and air/heat stable rylene diimide doped n&#8208;type single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) films. Before the preparation of the PTE devices, a wet&#8208;compressing approach was developed to improve the thermoelectric power factors and ZT of the SWCNT hybrid films. Then the achieved high&#8208;performance films were cut and patterned automatically to make PTE devices with various complex structures by the proposed ALF method.The free&#8208;standing PTE device with a narrow transition area of &#8764;2&#8208;3 &#181;m between the p&#8208; and n&#8208; modules exhibited a high output power of &gt;1.7 &#181;W and a high&#8208;power density of 0.32 &#181;W/cm2 under the light of 200 mW/cm2 which is among the highest level for free&#8208;standing film&#8208;based PTE devices. The results pave the way to high&#8208;performance, scalable, and flexible PTE devices with automatic production process for green power generation and ultra&#8208;broadband light detection.

Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional metal halide perovskites are an emerging class of light&#8208;emitting materials for LED&#8208;based displays; however, their B&#8208;site cations are confined to ns2, d5, and d10 metals. Here, we present the design of rare earth ions at B&#8208;site and report a novel Eu(II)&#8208;based iodide hybrid with efficient (PLQY &#8764; 98%) narrow&#8208;band (FWHM &#8764; 43 nm) green emission and high thermal stability (97%@150 &#176;C). Owing to reduced lattice vibrations and shrunken average distance of Eu(II)&#8208;iodide bonds in the face&#8208;sharing 1D&#8208;structure, photoluminescence from Eu(II) 4f&#8208;5d transition appears along with elevated crystal&#8208;field splitting of 5d energy level. We further demonstrate the Eu(II)&#8208;based iodide hybrid for color&#8208;pure green pc&#8208;LEDs with a maximum brightness of approximately 396,000 cd m&#8722;2 and photoelectric efficiency of 29.2%. We also present high&#8208;resolution micro&#8208;LED displays (2540 PPI) via the solution&#8208;processed screen. This work thus showcases a compelling narrow&#8208;band green emitter for commercial micro&#8208;LED displays.

         <title>Photoactivation Inducing Multifunctional Coupling of Fluorophore for Efficient Tumor Therapy in Situ</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Photoactivatable molecules, with high&#8208;precision spatial and temporal control, have largely promoted bioimaging and phototherapy applications, particularly for fluorescent dyes. Here, we described the first photoactivatable sensor (BI) that can be triggered by broad excitation light (405&#8208;660&#160;nm), which further undergoes ISC (intersystem crossing) and HAT (H&#8208;atom transfer) processes to the formation of superoxide anion radicals (O2&#8722;&#8226;) and carbon radicals. Particularly, the photoinduced gain of carbon&#8208;centered radicals (BI&#8226;) allows for radical&#8208;radical coupling to afford the combined crosslink product (BI&#8208;BI), which would be oxidized in the presence of O2&#8722;&#8226; to produce an extended conjugate system with NIR emission (820&#160;nm). Besides, the photochemically generated product (Cy&#8208;BI) possesses ultra&#8208;high PCE (photothermal conversion efficiency) up to 90.9%, which enables optimized potential for phototherapy. What's more, Western Blot assay revealed that both BI and the coresponding photoproduct Cy&#8208;BI could efficiently inhibit the expression of CHK1, and the irradiation of BI and Cy&#8208;BI further induced apoptosis and ultimately enhancing the phototherapeutic effects. Thus, the combination of cell cycle block inducing apoptosis, PDT (photodynamic therapy) and PTT (photothermal therapy) treatment significantly suppressed solid tumor in vivo antitumor efficacy explorations. This is a novel finding in developing photoactivatable molecules, as well as the broad applicability of photoimaging and phototherapy in tumor&#8208;related areas.

         <title>In Vivo Stimulation of Therapeutic Antigen&#8208;Specific T Cells in an Artificial Lymph Node Matrix</title>

Abstract
T cells are a critical mediator of antigen&#8208;specific immune responses and are common targets for engineering anti&#8208;tumor immunotherapy. Biomaterials scaffolds have previously been used to stimulate antigen presenting cells to elicit antigen&#8208;specific immune responses; however, structural and molecular features that directly stimulate and expand na&#239;ve, endogenous, tumor&#8208;specific T cells in vivo have not been defined. Here, we create an artificial lymph node (aLN) matrix, which consists of an extracellular matrix hydrogel conjugated with peptide&#8208;loaded&#8208;MHC complex (Signal 1), the co&#8208;stimulatory signal anti&#8208;CD28 (Signal 2), and a tethered IL&#8208;2 (Signal 3), that can bypass challenges faced by other approaches to activate T cells in situ, such as vaccines. This dynamic immune&#8208;stimulating platform enables direct, in vivo antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ T cell stimulation as well as recruitment and coordination of host immune cells, providing an immuno&#8208;stimulatory microenvironment for antigen&#8208;specific T cell activation and expansion. Co&#8208;injecting the aLN with na&#239;ve, wild type CD8+ T cells results in robust activation and expansion of tumor&#8208;targeted T cells that kill target cells and slow tumor growth in several distal tumor models. The aLN platform induces potent in vivo antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ T cell stimulation without the need for ex vivo priming or expansion and enables in situ manipulation of antigen&#8208;specific responses for immunotherapies.

&lt;p&gt;T cells are a critical mediator of antigen-specific immune responses and are common targets for engineering anti-tumor immunotherapy. Biomaterials scaffolds have previously been used to stimulate antigen presenting cells to elicit antigen-specific immune responses; however, structural and molecular features that directly stimulate and expand na&#239;ve, endogenous, tumor-specific T cells in vivo have not been defined. Here, we create an artificial lymph node (aLN) matrix, which consists of an extracellular matrix hydrogel conjugated with peptide-loaded-MHC complex (Signal 1), the co-stimulatory signal anti-CD28 (Signal 2), and a tethered IL-2 (Signal 3), that can bypass challenges faced by other approaches to activate T cells in situ, such as vaccines. This dynamic immune-stimulating platform enables direct, in vivo antigen-specific CD8+ T cell stimulation as well as recruitment and coordination of host immune cells, providing an immuno-stimulatory microenvironment for antigen-specific T cell activation and expansion.

         <title>Planar Cation Passivation on Colloidal Quantum Dots Enables High&#8208;performance 0.35&#8208;1.8&#160;&#956;m Broadband TFT Imager</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are promising candidates for broadband photodetectors from visible light to shortwave infrared (SWIR). However, large&#8208;size PbS CQDs sensitive to longer SWIR are mainly exposed with nonpolar (100) facets on the surface, which lack robust passivation strategies. Herein, an innovative passivation strategy that employs planar cation, is introduced to enable face&#8208;to&#8208;face coupling on (100) facets and strengthen halide passivation on (111) facets. The defect density of CQDs film (Eg &#8764;0.74&#160;eV) is reduced from 2.74&#215;1015 to 1.04&#215;1015 cm&#8722;3, coupled with 0.1&#160;eV reduction in the activation energy of defects. The resultant CQDs photodiodes exhibit a low dark current density of 14 nA cm&#8722;2 with a high external quantum efficiency of 62%, achieving a linear dynamic range of 98&#160;dB, a &#8722;3db bandwidth of 103&#160;kHz and a detectivity of 4.7&#215;1011 Jones. The comprehensive performance of our CQDs photodiodes outperforms previously reported CQDs photodiodes operating at &gt;1.6&#160;&#956;m. By monolithically integrated with thin&#8208;film transistor (TFT) readout circuit, the broadband CQDs imager covering 0.35&#8208;1.8&#160;&#956;m realizes the functions including silicon wafer perspectivity and material discrimination, showing its potentials for wide applications.

         <title>Sensitive Organic Photodetectors With Spectral Response up to 1.3&#160;&#956;m using a Quinoidal Molecular Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Detecting short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) light has underpinned several emerging technologies. However, the development of highly sensitive organic photodetectors (OPDs) operating in the SWIR region is hindered by their poor external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) and high dark currents. Herein, we report the development of high&#8208;sensitivity SWIR&#8208;OPDs with an efficient photoelectric response extending up to 1.3&#160;&#956;m. These OPDs utilize a new ultralow&#8208;bandgap molecular semiconductor featuring a quinoidal tricyclic electron&#8208;deficient central unit and multiple non&#8208;covalent conformation locks. The SWIR&#8208;OPD achieves an unprecedented EQE of 26% under zero bias and an even more impressive EQE of up to 41% under a &#8211;4&#160;V bias at 1.10&#160;&#956;m, effectively pushing the detection limit of silicon photodetectors. Additionally, the low energetic disorder and trap density in the active layer lead to significant suppression of thermal&#8208;generation carriers and dark current, resulting in excellent detectivity (Dsh*) exceeding 1013 Jones from 0.50 to 1.21&#160;&#956;m and surpassing 1012 Jones even at 1.30&#160;&#956;m under zero bias, marking the highest achievements for OPDs beyond the silicon limit to date. Validation through photoplethysmography measurements, a spectrometer prototype in the 0.35&#8211;1.25&#160;&#956;m range, and image capture under 1.20&#160;&#956;m irradiation demonstrate the extensive applications of this SWIR&#8208;OPD.

         <title>Synergy of Dendrites&#8208;Impeded Atomic Clusters Dissociation and Side Reactions Suppressed Inert Interface Protection for Ultrastable Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional composite interphase of Bi/Bi2O3 is in situ designed on Zn anode, for the first time initiating a synergistic modulation mechanism: the innovative thermodynamically favorable Zn atomic clusters dissociation mechanism inhibiting dendrites formation and chemically inert interface protection mechanism alleviating interfacial side reactions. Eventually, Zn@Bi/Bi2O3 electrode exhibits remarkably prominent cyclic performance both in symmetry cells system and practical full cells system.








Abstract
The sluggish ions&#8208;transfer and inhomogeneous ions&#8208;nucleation induce the formation of randomly oriented dendrites on Zn anode, while the chemical instability at anode&#8211;electrolyte interface triggers detrimental side reactions. Herein, this report in situ designs a multifunctional hybrid interphase of Bi/Bi2O3, for the first time resulting in a novel synergistic regulation mechanism involving: (i) chemically inert interface protection mechanism suppresses side reactions; and more fantastically, (ii) innovative thermodynamically favorable Zn atomic clusters dissociation mechanism impedes dendrites formation. Assisted by collaborative modulation behavior, the Zn@Bi/Bi2O3 symmetry cell delivers an ultrahigh cumulative plating capacity of 1.88 Ah cm&#8722;2 at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and ultralong lifetimes of 300&#160;h even at high current density and depth of discharge (10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, DODZn: 60%). Furthermore, under a low electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;capacity ratio (E/C: 45&#160;&#181;L mAh&#8722;1) and negative&#8208;to&#8208;positive capacity ratio (N/P: 6.3), Zn@Bi/Bi2O3||MnO2 full&#8208;cell exhibits a superior capacity retention of 86.7% after 500 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1, which outperforms most existing interphases. The scaled&#8208;up Zn@Bi/Bi2O3||MnO2 battery module (6&#160;V, 1 Ah), combined with the photovoltaic panel, presents excellent renewable&#8208;energy storage ability and long output lifetime (12&#160;h). This work provides a fantastic synergistic mechanism to achieve the ultrastable Zn anode and can be greatly promised to apply it into other metal&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>2D Lateral Heterojunction Arrays with Tailored Interface Band Bending</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports on a new strategy, using semiconducting monolayers of Si2Te2 and Sb2Te3, for the epitaxial growth of high&#8208;density lateral heterojunction arrays with tunable interfacial band alignment. Scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy measurements demonstrate the continuous lattice of the two&#8208;dimensional&#160;Si2Te2/Sb2Te3 lateral heterojunctions and directly reveal the tailored type&#8208;II band bending at the interface.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) lateral heterojunction arrays, characterized by well&#8208;defined electronic interfaces, hold significant promise for advancing next&#8208;generation electronic devices. Despite this potential, the efficient synthesis of high&#8208;density lateral heterojunctions with tunable interfacial band alignment remains a challenging. Here, a novel strategy is reported for the fabrication of lateral heterojunction arrays between monolayer Si2Te2 grown on Sb2Te3 (ML&#8208;Si2Te2@Sb2Te3) and one&#8208;quintuple&#8208;layer Sb2Te3 grown on monolayer Si2Te2 (1QL&#8208;Sb2Te3@ML&#8208;Si2Te2) on a p&#8208;doped Sb2Te3 substrate. The site&#8208;specific formation of numerous periodically arranged 2D ML&#8208;Si2Te2@Sb2Te3/1QL&#8208;Sb2Te3@ML&#8208;Si2Te2 lateral heterojunctions is realized solely through three epitaxial growth steps of thick&#8208;Sb2Te3, ML&#8208;Si2Te2, and 1QL&#8208;Sb2Te3 films, sequentially. More importantly, the precisely engineering of the interfacial band alignment is realized, by manipulating the substrate's p&#8208;doping effect with lateral spatial dependency, on each ML&#8208;Si2Te2@Sb2Te3/1QL&#8208;Sb2Te3@ML&#8208;Si2Te2 junction. Atomically sharp interfaces of the junctions with continuous lattices are observed by scanning tunneling microscopy.

&lt;p&gt;This work reports on a new strategy, using semiconducting monolayers of Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, for the epitaxial growth of high-density lateral heterojunction arrays with tunable interfacial band alignment. Scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy measurements demonstrate the continuous lattice of the two-dimensional&#160;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; lateral heterojunctions and directly reveal the tailored type-II band bending at the interface.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-dimensional (2D) lateral heterojunction arrays, characterized by well-defined electronic interfaces, hold significant promise for advancing next-generation electronic devices. Despite this potential, the efficient synthesis of high-density lateral heterojunctions with tunable interfacial band alignment remains a challenging. Here, a novel strategy is reported for the fabrication of lateral heterojunction arrays between monolayer Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; grown on Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (ML-Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and one-quintuple-layer Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; grown on monolayer Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (1QL-Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@ML-Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) on a &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-doped Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; substrate. The site-specific formation of numerous periodically arranged 2D ML-Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/1QL-Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@ML-Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lateral heterojunctions is realized solely through three epitaxial growth steps of thick-Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ML-Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and 1QL-Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; films, sequentially. More importantly, the precisely engineering of the interfacial band alignment is realized, by manipulating the substrate's &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-doping effect with lateral spatial dependency, on each ML-Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/1QL-Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@ML-Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; junction. Atomically sharp interfaces of the junctions with continuous lattices are observed by scanning tunneling microscopy. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements directly reveal the tailored type-II band bending at the interface. This reported strategy opens avenues for advancing lateral epitaxy technology, facilitating practical applications of 2D in-plane heterojunctions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Observation of High&#8208;Capacity Monoclinic B&#8208;Nb2O5 with Ultrafast Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monoclinic B&#8208;Nb2O5 of same chemistry as T&#8208;Nb2O5 and similar structure to B&#8208;TiO2 is essentially inert for lithium storage. To address this issue, here implementation of both electron transport and Li+ migration &#8220;superhighways&#8221; by developing defect&#8208;rich and nanoporous B&#8208;Nb2O5&#8722;x pseudocrystals via a &#8220;shape&#8208;keep&#8221; topological microcorrosion is proposed. The resulting B&#8208;Nb2O5&#8722;x achieves ultrahigh specific capacity and rate capability, surpassing that of Li4Ti5O12.








Abstract
Apart from Li4Ti5O12, there are few anode substitutes that can be used in commercial high&#8208;power lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Orthorhombic T&#8208;Nb2O5 has recently been proven to be another substitute anode. However, monoclinic B&#8208;Nb2O5 of same chemistry is essentially inert for lithium storage, but the underlying reasons are unclear. In order to activate the &#8220;inert&#8221; B&#8208;Nb2O5, herein, nanoporous pseudocrystals to achieve a larger specific capacity of 243 mAh g&#8722;1 than Li4Ti5O12 (theoretical capacity: 175 mAh g&#8722;1) are proposed. These pseudocrystals are rationally synthesized via a &#8220;shape&#8208;keep&#8221; topological microcorrosion process from LiNbO3 precursor. Compared to pristine B&#8208;Nb2O5, experimental investigations reveal that B&#8208;Nb2O5&#8722;x delivers &#8776;3000 times higher electronic conductivity and tenfold enhanced Li+ diffusion coefficient. An &#8776;30% reduction of energy barrier for Li&#8208;ion migration is also confirmed by the theoretical calculations. The nanoporous B&#8208;Nb2O5&#8722;x delivers unique ion/electron transport channels to proliferate the reversible and deeper lithiation, which activate the &#8220;inert&#8221; B&#8208;Nb2O5. The capacitive&#8208;like behavior is observed to endow B&#8208;Nb2O5&#8722;x ultrafast lithium storage ability, harvesting 136 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 C and 72 mAh g&#8722;1 even at 250 C, superior to Li4Ti5O12. Pouch&#8208;type full cells exhibit the energy density of &#8776;251&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and ultrahigh power density up to &#8776;35&#160;kW kg&#8722;1.

         <title>Electrochemically Exfoliated Graphene Additive&#8208;Free Inks for 3D Printing Customizable Monolithic Integrated Micro&#8208;Supercapacitors on a Large Scale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cost&#8208;effective, additive&#8208;free, highly robust, and environmentally friendly graphene ink is demonstrated for large&#8208;scale 3D printed MSCs, showing extremely high areal and volumetric energy density, high temperature stability, and good integration. This work provides a great reference value for the commercialization of graphene in the field of 3D printing.








Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) printing technology with enhanced fidelity can achieve multiple functionalities and boost electrochemical performance of customizable planar micro&#8208;supercapacitors (MSCs), however, precise structural control of additive&#8208;free graphene&#8208;based macro&#8208;assembly electrode for monolithic integrated MSCs (MIMSCs) remains challenging. Here, the large&#8208;scale 3D printing fabrication of customizable planar MIMSCs is reported utilizing additive&#8208;free, high&#8208;quality electrochemically exfoliated graphene inks, which is not required the conventional cryogenic assistance during the printing process and any post&#8208;processing reduction. The resulting MSCs reveal an extremely small engineering footprint of 0.025&#160;cm2, exceptionally high areal capacitance of 4900&#160;mF&#160;cm&#8722;2, volumetric capacitance of 195.6&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;3, areal energy density of 2.1&#160;mWh&#160;cm&#8722;2, and unprecedented volumetric energy density of 23&#160;mWh&#160;cm&#8722;3 for a single cell, surpassing most previously reported 3D printed MSCs. The 3D printed MIMSC pack is further demonstrated, with the maximum areal cell count density of 16&#160;cell&#160;cm&#8722;2, the highest output voltage of 192.5&#160;V and the largest output voltage per unit area of 56&#160;V&#160;cm&#8722;2 up to date are achieved. This work presents an innovative solution for processing high&#8208;performance additive&#8208;free graphene ink and realizing the large&#8208;scale production of 3D printed MIMSCs for planar energy storage.

         <title>CVD Synthesis of Twisted Bilayer WS2 with Tunable Second Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twisted bilayer transitionmetal dichalcogenides provide a unique platform for investigating intriguing fundamental physical properties. A tilted SiO2/Si substrate is introduced into chemical vapordeposition to synthesize twisted bilayer WS2 with a wide twist angle range from 0&#176; to 120&#176;. The strong correlation between the SHG response and the twist angle suggests atunable SHG performance with twist angles.








Abstract
The introduction of rotational freedom by twist angles in twisted bilayer (TB) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) can tailor the inherent properties of the TMDCs, which provides a promising platform to investigate the exotic physical properties. However, direct synthesis of high&#8208;quality TB&#8208;TMDCs with full twist angles is significantly challenging due to the substantial energy barriers during crystal growth. Here, a modified chemical vapor deposition strategy is proposed to synthesize TB&#8208;WS2 with a wide twist angle range from 0&#176; to 120&#176;. Utilizing a tilted SiO2/Si substrate, a gas flow disturbance is generated in the furnace tube to create a heterogeneous concentration gradient of the metal precursor, which provides an extra driving force for the growth of TB&#8208;WS2. The Raman and photoluminescence results confirm a weak interlayer coupling of the TB&#8208;WS2. High&#8208;quality periodic Moir&#233; patterns are observed in the scanning transmission electron microscopy images. Moreover, owing to the strong correlation between the nonlinear optical response and the twisted crystal structure, tunable second harmonic generation behaviors are realized in the TB&#8208;WS2. This approach opens up a new avenue for the direct growth of high&#8208;crystalline&#8208;quality and pristine TB&#8208;TMDCs and their potential applications in nonlinear optical devices.

This approach opens up a new avenue for the direct growth of high-crystalline-quality and pristine TB-TMDCs and their potential applications in nonlinear optical devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Piezocatalytic Schottky Junction Treats Atherosclerosis by a Biomimetic Trojan Horse Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports on the engineering of a rod&#8208;like gold&#8208;zinc oxide (Au&#8208;ZnO) Schottky junction for enhanced piezocatalytic performance and camouflage with the macrophage membrane for improved biocompatibility and intraplaque enrichment. The obtained biomimetic Au&#8208;ZnO@MM promotes foamy macrophage apoptosis as well as cholesterol efflux and efferocytosis activated by apoptotic fragments, fulfilling amplified piezocatalytic atherosclerosis therapy by a biomimetic Trojan horse strategy.








Abstract
The atherosclerotic vulnerable plaque is characterized by the&#160;foamy macrophage burden, involving impaired cholesterol efflux and deficient efferocytosis. Correspondingly, piezocatalytic therapy is an emerging solution for eliminating the foamy macrophage burden with satisfactory spatiotemporal controllability and deep penetration depth. Herein, a biomimetic Trojan horse (Au&#8208;ZnO@MM) is engineered by coating the macrophage membrane (MM) onto the surface of a rod&#8208;like Au&#8208;ZnO Schottky Junction to effectively relieve the atherosclerotic progression. These Trojan horses with the coating of MM are actively transported into subsistent foamy macrophages and generate abundant reactive oxygen species (ROS) via ultrasound&#8208;activated piezocatalysis. ROS&#8208;initiated autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction induce substantial cell apoptosis, alleviating the burden of subsistent foamy macrophages. The resulting apoptotic fragments further significantly facilitate cholesterol excretion and trigger efferocytosis of intraplaque fresh macrophages. Ultimately, the biomimetic Au&#8208;ZnO@MM piezocatalyst not only inhibits the foaming capacity of macrophages, but also improves the function of removing cell debris, which can stabilize atherosclerotic vulnerable plaque. Meanwhile, the plasmon resonance effect of integrated gold nanoparticles enables favorable photoacoustic molecular imaging for real&#8208;time image&#8208;guided atherosclerotic therapy. This proposed biomimetic Trojan horse strategy provides the paradigm of employing ultrasound&#8208;activated piezocatalytic methodology for enhanced atherosclerotic theranostics.

         <title>Important Role of Ion Flux Regulated by Separators in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The three&#8208;dimensional pore structures of polyolefin separators have a significant influence on the ion flux distribution towards the lithium (Li) electrode, which consequently causes different Li deposition behavior. It is revealed that an appropriate separator creates a more homogeneous Li ion flux, a more compact deposit Li, and enables Li metal batteries to achieve a longer cycle life.








Abstract
Polyolefin separators are the most common separators used in rechargeable lithium (Li)&#8208;ion batteries. However, the influence of different polyolefin separators on the performance of Li metal batteries (LMBs) has not been well studied. By performing particle injection simulations on the reconstructed three&#8208;dimensional&#160;pores of different polyethylene separators, it is revealed that the pore structure of the separator has a significant impact on the ion flux distribution, the Li deposition behavior, and consequently, the cycle life of LMBs. It is also discovered that the homogeneity factor of Li&#8208;ion toward Li metal electrode is positively correlated to the longevity and reproducibility of LMBs. This work not only emphasizes the importance of the pore structure of polyolefin separators but also provides an economic and effective method to screen favorable separators for LMBs.

         <title>Synchronous and Fully Steerable Active Particle Systems for Enhanced Mimicking of Collective Motion in Nature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel active&#8208;particle experimental platform is developed to imitate collective motion observed in nature. Fully synchronous and arbitrary navigation of active particles are implemented at individual level. Particle motion is regulated by the bio&#8208;inspired velocity alignment rule and long&#8208;range physical interaction. Density&#8208;dependent state&#8208;transition and high robustness to noisy environments are observed experimentally in a controllable and realistic manner.








Abstract
The collective motion observed in living active matter, such as fish schools and bird flocks, is characterized by its dynamic and complex nature, involving various moving states and transitions. By tailoring physical interactions or incorporating information exchange capabilities, inanimate active particles can exhibit similar behavior. However, the lack of synchronous and arbitrary control over individual particles hinders their use as a test system for the study of more intricate collective motions in living species. Herein, a novel optical feedback control system that enables the mimicry of collective motion observed in living objects using active particles is proposed. This system allows for the experimental investigation of the velocity alignment, a seminal model of collective motion (known as the Vicsek model), in a microscale perturbed environment with controllable and realistic conditions. The spontaneous formation of different moving states and dynamic transitions between these states is observed. Additionally, the high robustness of the active&#8208;particle group at the critical density under the influence of different perturbations is quantitatively validated. These findings support the effectiveness of velocity alignment in real perturbed environments, thereby providing a versatile platform for fundamental studies on collective motion and the development of innovative swarm microrobotics.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Phenolic Network with Pd Nanoparticle Nodes Synergizes Oxidase&#8208;Like and Photothermal Properties to Eradicate Oral Polymicrobial Biofilm&#8208;Associated Infections</title>

A polyphenol&#8208;palladium network with excellent oxidase&#8208;like activity and photothermal effect is constructed. The reactive oxygen species treatment mediated by the oxidase&#8208;like activity of the network exhibits selective antibacterial effects, while its photothermal effect&#8208;induced hyperthermia possesses potent antifungal properties. Moreover, synergistic antimicrobial systems mediated by the network exhibit remarkable efficacy in combating various biofilms and polymicrobial biofilms, which can be used to treat oral biofilm&#8208;associated infections.








Abstract
Designing an effective treatment strategy to combat oral diseases caused by complex polymicrobial biofilms remains a great challenge. Herein, a series of metal&#8208;phenolic network with Pd nanoparticle nodes using polyphenols as stabilizers and reducing agents is constructed. Among them, sulfonated lignin&#8208;Pd (SLS&#8208;Pd) with ultrafine size palladium nanoparticles and broadband near infrared absorption exhibit excellent oxidase&#8208;like activity and stable photothermal effect. In vitro experiments demonstrate that the superoxide radical generated by SLS&#8208;Pd oxidase&#8208;like activity exhibits selective antibacterial effects, while its photothermal effect induced hyperthermia exhibits potent antifungal properties. This difference is further elucidated by RNA&#8208;sequencing analysis and all&#8208;atom simulation. Moreover, the SLS&#8208;Pd&#8208;mediated synergistic antimicrobial system exhibits remarkable efficacy in combating various biofilms and polymicrobial biofilms. By establishing a root canal model and an oropharyngeal candidiasis model, the feasibility of the synergistic antimicrobial system in treating oral biofilm&#8208;related infections is further validated. This system provides a promising therapeutic approach for polymicrobial biofilm&#8208;associated infections in the oral cavity.

         <title>Tough and Moldable Sustainable Cellulose&#8208;Based Structural Materials via Multiscale Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance multiscale cellulose&#8208;based structural material is constructed through a multiscale interface engineering strategy. The positive and negative charges treatment of microfibers and nanofibers effectively solves the interface bonding problem in multiscale design, and allows them to be easily shaped into complex three&#8208;dimensional special&#8208;shaped structures. This sustainable material offers superior mechanical and thermal properties compared to petrochemical&#8208;based plastics.








Abstract
All&#8208;natural materials derived from cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) are expected to be used to replace engineering plastics and have attracted much attention. However, the lack of crack extension resistance and 3D formability of nanofiber&#8208;based structural materials hinders their practical applications. Here, a multiscale interface engineering strategy is reported to construct high&#8208;performance cellulose&#8208;based materials. The sisal microfibers are surface treated to expose abundant active CNFs with positive charges, thereby enhancing their interfacial combination with the negatively charged CNFs. The robust multiscale dual network enables easy molding of multiscale cellulose&#8208;based structural materials into complex 3D special&#8208;shaped structures, resulting in nearly twofold and fivefold improvements in toughness and impact resistance compared with those of CNFs&#8208;based materials. Moreover, this multiscale interface engineering strategy endows cellulose&#8208;based structural materials with better comprehensive performance than petrochemical&#8208;based plastics and broadens cellulose's potential for lightweight applications as structural materials with lower environmental effects.

The sisal microfibers are surface treated to expose abundant active CNFs with positive charges, thereby enhancing their interfacial combination with the negatively charged CNFs. The robust multiscale dual network enables easy molding of multiscale cellulose-based structural materials into complex 3D special-shaped structures, resulting in nearly twofold and fivefold improvements in toughness and impact resistance compared with those of CNFs-based materials. Moreover, this multiscale interface engineering strategy endows cellulose-based structural materials with better comprehensive performance than petrochemical-based plastics and broadens cellulose's potential for lightweight applications as structural materials with lower environmental effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Revealing the Anion&#8211;Solvent Interaction for Ultralow Temperature Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anion solvation is demonstrated as a new direction to rational design the electrolyte for lithium metal batteries and beyond to achieve high performance. The designed electrolyte with strong anion&#8211;solvent interaction enables 2.0 mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 NMC811||Li (20&#160;&#181;m) full cells to achieve excellent high voltage and low temperature performance, retaining over 92% of initial capacity after 100 cycles even under &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Anion solvation in electrolytes can largely change the electrochemical performance of the electrolytes, yet has been rarely investigated. Herein, three anions of bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI), bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSI), and derived asymmetric (fluorosulfonyl)(trifluoro&#8208;methanesulfonyl)imide (FTFSI) are systematically examined in a weakly Li+ cation solvating solvent of bis(3&#8208;fluoropropyl)ether (BFPE). In&#8208;situ liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry demonstrates that FTFSI&#8722; and FSI&#8722; anions are associated with BFPE solvent, while weak TFSI&#8722;/BFPE cluster signals are detected. Molecular modeling further reveals that the anion&#8211;solvent interaction is accompanied by the formation of H&#8208;bonding&#8208;like interactions. Anion solvation enhances the Li+ cation transfer number and reduces the organic component in solid electrolyte interphase, which enhances the Li plating/stripping Coulombic efficiency at a low temperature of &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C from 42.4% in TFSI&#8208;based electrolytes to 98.7% in 1.5&#160;m LiFTFSI and 97.9% in LiFSI&#8208;BFPE electrolytes. The anion&#8211;solvent interactions, especially asymmetric anion solvation also accelerate the Li+ desolvation kinetics. The 1.5&#160;m LiFTFSI&#8208;BFPE electrolyte with strong anion&#8211;solvent interaction enables LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811)||Li (20&#160;&#181;m) full cell with stable cyclability even under &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, retaining over 92% of initial capacity (115 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, after 100 cycles). The anion&#8211;solvent interactions insights allow to rational design the electrolyte for lithium metal batteries and beyond to achieve high performance.

         <title>Micro&#8208;to&#8208;Nano Oncolytic Microbial System Shifts from Tumor Killing to Tumor Draining Lymph Nodes Remolding for Enhanced Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops the micro&#8208;to&#8208;nano oncolytic microbial system to exert tumor killing and remold tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLNs). Under laser irradiation, the &#8220;microscale&#8221; Escherichia coli (EcP) is triggered to secret the &#8220;nanoscale&#8221; outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). Meanwhile, EcP generates toxic H2O2 and leads to the release of tumor antigens. The enhanced TDLNs delivery via OMVs regulates the TDLNs immunomicroenvironment, promoting the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) to potentiate antitumor immune response.








Abstract
Because the tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) microenvironment is commonly immunosuppressive, oncolytic microbe&#8208;induced tumor antigens aren't sufficiently cross&#8208;primed tumor specific T cells through antigen&#8208;presenting cells (e.g., dendritic cells (DCs)) in TDLNs. Herein, this work develops the micro&#8208;to&#8208;nano oncolytic microbial therapeutics based on pyranose oxidase (P2O) overexpressed Escherichia coli (EcP) which are simultaneously encapsulated by PEGylated mannose and low&#8208;concentrated photosensitizer nanoparticles (NPs). Following administration, P2O from this system generates toxic hydrogen peroxide for tumor regression and leads to the release of tumor antigens. The &#8220;microscale&#8221; EcP is triggered, following exposure to the laser irradiation, to secrete the &#8220;nanoscale&#8221; bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). The enhanced TDLNs delivery via OMVs significantly regulates the TDLNs immunomicroenvironment, promoting the maturation of DCs to potentiate tumor antigen&#8208;specific T cells immune response. The micro&#8208;to&#8208;nano oncolytic microbe is leveraged to exert tumor killing and remold TDLNs for initiating potent activation of DCs, providing promising strategies to facilitate microbial cancer vaccination.

         <title>Distinguishing Molecular Mechanical Action from Photothermal and Photodynamic Behavior</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular motors are small molecule actuators that can permeabilize lipid bilayers, kill cancer cells and microorganisms, and control cell signaling. Here, a roadmap is provided detailing how to distinguish the photomechanical action characteristic to these motors from photothermal and photodynamic effects. It is hoped that this framework leads to a robust criterion for the isolation of the effects of molecular motion as the community seeks to use molecular motors for new and distinctive applications.








Abstract
Molecular motors (MM) are molecular machines, or nanomachines, that rotate unidirectionally upon photostimulation and perform mechanical work on their environment. In the last several years, it has been shown that the photomechanical action of MM can be used to permeabilize lipid bilayers, thereby killing cancer cells and pathogenic microorganisms and controlling cell signaling. The work contributes to a growing acknowledgement that the molecular actuation characteristic of these systems is useful for various applications in biology. However, the mechanical effects of molecular motion on biological materials are difficult to disentangle from photodynamic and photothermal action, which are also present when a light&#8208;absorbing fluorophore is irradiated with light. Here, an overview of the key methods used by various research groups to distinguish the effects of photomechanical, photodynamic, and photothermal action is provided. It is anticipated that this discussion will be helpful to the community seeking to use MM to develop new and distinctive medical technologies that result from mechanical disruption of biological materials.

         <title>Selectively Modulating Componential Morphologies of Bulk Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared photon&#8208;assisted annealing facilitates high&#8208;performance binary organic solar cells with an impressive efficiency of 19.25% under mild conditions, which allows selectively tuning the molecular ordering of narrow bandgap acceptors within polymer networks to achieve optimal morphologies.








Abstract
Achieving precise control over the nanoscale morphology of bulk heterojunction films presents a significant challenge for the conventional post&#8208;treatments employed in organic solar cells (OSCs). In this study, a near&#8208;infrared photon&#8208;assisted annealing (NPA) strategy is developed for fabricating high&#8208;performance OSCs under mild processing conditions. It is revealed a top NIR light illumination, together with the bottom heating, enables the selective tuning of the molecular arrangement and assembly of narrow bandgap acceptors in polymer networks to achieve optimal morphologies, as well as the acceptor&#8208;rich top surface of active layers. The derived OSCs exhibit a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.25%, representing one of the highest PCEs for the reported binary OSCs so far. Moreover, via the NPA strategy, it has succeeded in accessing top&#8208;illuminated flexible OSCs using thermolabile polyethylene terephthalate from mineral water bottles, displaying excellent mechanical stabilities. Overall, this work will hold the potential to develop organic solar cells under mild processing with various substrates.

         <title>Spinning a Liquid Wheel and Driving Surface Thermomagnetic Convection with Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A laser beam can produce not only a double&#8208;eye vortex but also prompt liquid rotation resembling a windmill. These occurrences signify the presence of thermomagnetic convection in ferrofluids. Surface thermomagnetic convection is achieved by mitigating Marangoni convection, while the spinning ferrofluid exemplifies a Tesla thermomagnetic engine, facilitated by its heightened viscosity under the influence of a strong magnetic field.








Abstract
A typical Tesla thermomagnetic engine employs a solid magnetic wheel to convert thermal energy into mechanical energy, while thermomagnetic convection in ferrofluid is still challenging to observe because it is a volume convection that occurs in an enclosed space. Using a water&#8208;based ferrofluid, a liquid Tesla thermomagnetic engine is demonstrated and reports the observation of thermomagnetic convection on a free surface. Both types of fluid motions are driven by light and observed by simply placing ferrofluid on a cylindrical magnet. The surface thermomagnetic convection on the free surface is made possible by eliminating the Marangoni effect, while the spinning of the liquid wheel is achieved through the solid&#8208;like behavior of the ferrofluid under a strong magnetic field. Increasing the magnetic field reveals a transition from simple thermomagnetic convection to a combination of the central spin of the spiky wheel surrounded by thermomagnetic convection in the outer region of the ferrofluid. The coupling between multiple ferrofluid wheels through a fluid bridge is further demonstrated. These demonstrations not only unveil the unique properties of ferrofluid but also provide a new platform for studying complex fluid dynamics and thermomagnetic convection, opening up exciting opportunities for light&#8208;controlled fluid actuation and soft robotics.

         <title>Discovering Process Dynamics for Scalable Perovskite Solar Cell Manufacturing with Explainable AI</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study utilizes deep learning and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to understand and optimize the perovskite thin&#8208;film formation process for scalable solar cell manufacturing. Based on the findings of the algorithms and the interpretations of the material scientists, can be derived new insights and recommendations paving the way toward improved industrial&#8208;scale solar cell manufacturing.








Abstract
Large&#8208;area processing of perovskite semiconductor thin&#8208;films is complex and&#160;evokes unexplained variance in quality, posing a major hurdle for the commercialization of perovskite photovoltaics. Advances in scalable fabrication processes are currently limited to gradual and arbitrary trial&#8208;and&#8208;error procedures. While the in situ acquisition of photoluminescence (PL) videos has the potential to reveal important variations in the thin&#8208;film formation process, the high dimensionality of the data quickly surpasses the limits of human analysis. In response, this study leverages deep learning (DL) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to discover relationships between sensor information acquired during the perovskite thin&#8208;film formation process and the resulting solar cell performance indicators, while rendering these relationships humanly understandable. The study further shows how gained insights can be distilled into actionable recommendations for perovskite thin&#8208;film processing, advancing toward industrial&#8208;scale solar cell manufacturing. This study demonstrates that XAI methods will play a critical role in accelerating energy materials science.

         <title>Liquid Crystal Elastomer Artificial Tendrils with Asymmetric Core&#8211;Sheath Structure Showing Evolutionary Biomimetic Locomotion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystal elastomer artificial tendrils are elaborately designed to possess an asymmetric core&#8211;sheath architecture with differential degrees of mesogen orientation between the sheath and core layers across the semi&#8208;ellipse cross&#8208;section, which are not only capable of mimicking the helical deformation of natural tendrils but also able to be reprogrammed based on metallosupramolecular interactions to perform evolutionary flagellum&#8208;like locomotion.








Abstract
The sophisticated and complex haptonastic movements in response to environmental&#8208;stimuli of living organisms have always fascinated scientists. However, how to fundamentally mimic the sophisticated hierarchical architectures of living organisms to provide the artificial counterparts with similar or even beyond&#8208;natural functions based on the underlying mechanism remains a major scientific challenge. Here,&#160; liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) artificial tendrils showing evolutionary biomimetic locomotion are developed following the structure&#8211;function principle that is used in nature to grow climbing plants. These elaborately designed tendril&#8208;like LCE actuators possess an asymmetric core&#8211;sheath architecture which shows a higher&#8208;to&#8208;lower transition in the degree of LC orientation from the sheath&#8208;to&#8208;core layer across the semi&#8208;ellipse cross&#8208;section. Upon heating and cooling, the LCE artificial tendril can undergo reversible tendril&#8208;like shape&#8208;morphing behaviors, such as helical coiling/winding, and perversion. The fundamental mechanism of the helical shape&#8208;morphing of the artificial tendril is revealed by using theoretical models and finite element simulations. Besides, the incorporation of metal&#8208;ligand coordination into the LCE network provides the artificial tendril with reconfigurable shape&#8208;morphing performances such as helical transitions and rotational deformations. Finally, the abilities of helical and rotational deformations are integrated into a new reprogrammed flagellum&#8208;like architecture to perform evolutionary locomotion mimicking the haptonastic movements of the natural flagellum.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Binary and Ternary Organic Solar Cells Based on Novel Nonfused&#8208;Ring Electron Acceptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptors are synthesized, and the influence of different end groups and side chains on their performance is investigated. Among them, 2TT&#8208;C11&#8208;F&#8208;based devices achieve a power conversion efficiency of 13.03%. Furthermore, utilizing 2TT as the third component, a highly efficient ternary organic solar cell with an impressive efficiency of 19.39% is constructed, which is among the highest reported values.








Abstract
In this study, three nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (2TT, 2TT&#8208;C6&#8208;F, and 2TT&#8208;C11&#8208;F) with the same steric hindrance groups (2,4,6&#8208;tripropylbenzene) are designed and synthesized and the impact of electron&#8208;withdrawing and lateral alkyl side chains on the performance of binary and ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) is explored. For the binary OSCs, 2TT&#8208;C11&#8208;F with IC&#8208;2F terminal groups and lateral undecyl side chains display a red shifted absorption spectrum and suitable energy levels, and the corresponding blend film exhibits appropriate phase separation and crystallinity. Thus, binary OSCs based on 2TT&#8208;C11&#8208;F achieve an impressive power conversion efficiency of 13.03%, much higher than the efficiencies of those based on 2TT (9.68%) and 2TT&#8208;C6&#8208;F (12.11%). In the ternary OSCs, 2TT with CC terminal groups and lateral hexyl side chains exhibit complementary absorption and cascade energy levels with a host binary system (D18:BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;4F). Hence, the ternary OSCs based on 2TT achieve a remarkable efficiency of 19.39%, ranking among the highest reported values. The research yields comprehensive 2TT&#8208;series nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptors, demonstrating their great potential for the fabrication of high&#8208;performance binary and ternary OSCs.

         <title>Fully Recyclable Cured Polymers for Sustainable 3D Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel sustainable 3D printing approach, resulting in fully recyclable thermosets with multiple printing cycles at low temperatures, is presented. This study pushes the boundaries of light&#8208;based printing technologies while introducing novel compositions and reversible photopolymerization reactions, using a microwave that enables greener and more efficient additive manufacturing without any replenishing materials for (re)printing.








Abstract
The most prevalent materials used in the Additive Manufacturing era are polymers and plastics. Unfortunately, these materials are recognized for their negative environmental impact as they are primarily nonrecyclable, resulting in environmental pollution. In recent years, a new sustainable alternative to these materials has been emerging: Reversible Covalent Bond&#8208;Containing Polymers (RCBPs). These materials can be recycled, reprocessed, and reused multiple times without losing their properties. Nonetheless, they have two significant drawbacks when used in 3D printing. First, some require adding new materials every reprinting cycle, and second, others require high temperatures for (re)printing, limiting recyclability, and increasing energy consumption. This study, thus, introduces fully recyclable RCBPs as a sustainable approach for radiation&#8208;based printing technologies. This approach enables multiple (re)printing cycles at low temperatures (50&#160;&#176;C lower than the lowest reported) without adding new materials.

     alt="Fully Recyclable Cured Polymers for Sustainable 3D Printing"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel sustainable 3D printing approach, resulting in fully recyclable thermosets with multiple printing cycles at low temperatures, is presented. This study pushes the boundaries of light-based printing technologies while introducing novel compositions and reversible photopolymerization reactions, using a microwave that enables greener and more efficient additive manufacturing without any replenishing materials for (re)printing.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most prevalent materials used in the Additive Manufacturing era are polymers and plastics. Unfortunately, these materials are recognized for their negative environmental impact as they are primarily nonrecyclable, resulting in environmental pollution. In recent years, a new sustainable alternative to these materials has been emerging: Reversible Covalent Bond-Containing Polymers (RCBPs). These materials can be recycled, reprocessed, and reused multiple times without losing their properties. Nonetheless, they have two significant drawbacks when used in 3D printing. First, some require adding new materials every reprinting cycle, and second, others require high temperatures for (re)printing, limiting recyclability, and increasing energy consumption. This study, thus, introduces fully recyclable RCBPs as a sustainable approach for radiation-based printing technologies. This approach enables multiple (re)printing cycles at low temperatures (50&#160;&#176;C lower than the lowest reported) without adding new materials. It involves purposefully synthesized polymers that undergo reversible photopolymerization, composed of a tin-based catalyst.

         <title>Selective Electroreduction of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural to Dimethylfuran in Neutral Electrolytes via Hydrogen Spillover and Adsorption Configuration Adjustment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective electrocatalytic 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural reduction reaction&#160;in neutral electrolytes to 2,5&#8208;dihydroxymethylfuran is a challenging reaction. Loaded palladium (Pd) single atoms enable the adsorbed hydrogen (*H) spillover to increase the *H coverage on titanium dioxide (TiO2) and maintain the tilted configuration to activate the C&#9552;O bond, thus promoting selective electro&#8208;reduction to 2,5&#8208;dihydroxymethylfuran. Besides, the selective electro&#8208;reduction to bis(hydroxymethyl)hydro&#8208;furoin or 2,5&#8208;dihydroxymethylfuran can also be achieved on TiO2 or Pd nanoparticles loaded on Vulcan&#8208;XC72.








Abstract
5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), one of the essential C6 biomass derivatives, has been deeply investigated in electrocatalytic reduction upgrading. Nevertheless, the high product selectivity and rational design strategy of electrocatalysts for electrocatalytic HMF reduction is still a challenge. Here, a high selective electro&#8208;reduction of HMF to dimethylfuran (DMF) on palladium (Pd) single atom loaded on titanium dioxide&#160;(Pd SA/TiO2) via hydrogen spillover and adsorption configuration adjustment in neutral electrolytes is achieved. Combining density functional theory calculations and in situ characterization, it is revealed that Pd single atom&#160;could weaken the interaction between Pd atoms and adsorbed hydrogen (*H) to promote the *H spillover for increasing *H coverage on the surface and maintain the tilted adsorption configuration to activate C&#9552;O bond; thus the selectivity of DMF on Pd SA/TiO2 increases to 90.33%. Besides, it is elaborated that low *H coverage on TiO2 favors the formation of bis(hydroxymethyl)hydro&#8208;furoin (BHH), and the flat adsorption configuration of HMF on Pd nanoparticles benefits to form 2,5&#8208;dihydroxymethylfuran (DHMF). This work provides a promising approach for modifying electrocatalysts to realize the selective electroreduction of HMF to value&#8208;added products.

         <title>Targeted Depletion of Individual Pathogen by Bacteria&#8208;Templated Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A platform that uses bacteria as a template to synthesize guanidinium&#8208;functionalized polymers through copper catalyzed ATRP is reported. The polymers recovered from the bacterial surface show high bactericidal activity against the strains that templated them and deplete the target bacteria efficiently without significant collateral damage to complex microbial communities as compared to antibiotics.








Abstract
Selective and targeted removal of individual species or strains of bacteria from complex communities can be desirable over traditional and broadly acting antibiotics in several conditions. However, strategies that can detect and ablate bacteria with high specificity are emerging in recent years. Herein, a platform is reported that uses bacteria as a template to synthesize polymers containing guanidinium groups for self&#8208;selective depletion of specific pathogenic bacteria without disturbing microbial communities. Different from conventional antibiotics, repeated treatment of bacteria with the templated polymers does not evolve drug resistance mutants after 20 days of serial passaging. Especially, high in vivo therapeutic effectiveness of the templated polymers is achieved in E. coli&#8208; and P. aeruginosa&#8208;induced microbial peritonitis. The templated polymers have shown high selectivity in in vivo antimicrobial activity, which has excellent potential as systemic antimicrobials against bacterial infections.

         <title>Stepless IR Chromism in Ti3C2Tx MXene Tuned by Interlayer Water Molecules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stepless and reversible emissivity modulation with a broad range (&gt;50%) is revealed in stacked 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets as the intercalation/discharging of water molecules in the interlayers. This phenomenon can keep the human body in thermal comfort when changing metabolic rates (&#8776;20%) and environmental temperatures (&#8776;3 &#176;C) and show great potential in on&#8208;demand passive radiation modulation of other applications.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time control over infrared (IR) radiation of objects is highly desired in a variety of areas such as personal thermal regulation and IR camouflage. This requires the dynamic modulation of IR emissivity in a stepless manner over a wide range (&gt;50%), which remains a daunting challenge. Here, an emissivity modulation phenomenon is reported in stacked 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets, from 12% to 68% as the intercalation/discharging of water molecules within the interlayers. The intercalation of water molecules dynamically changes the electronic properties and the complex permittivity in IR frequencies of Ti3C2Tx. This emissivity modulation is a stepless and reversible process without the assistance of any external energy input. Further, intercalating cellulose nanofibers into the Ti3C2Tx interlayers makes this dynamic process highly repeatable. Last, a sweat&#8208;responsive adaptive textile that can improve thermal comfort of human body under changes in metabolic rates and environmental conditions is demonstrated, showing great potential of this mechanism in passive on&#8208;demand radiation modulation.

         <title>Modular Self&#8208;Assembling Dendrimer Nanosystems for Magnetic Resonance and Multimodality Imaging of Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modular self&#8208;assembling dendrimer probes are developed for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and MR/near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) bimodality imaging of tumors. These probes show high relaxivity at high magnetic field strength, giving excellent MR imaging contrast at low Gd&#8208;doses down to 1/10th of the standard clinical dose alongside effective NIRF imaging. This study highlights the promise of self&#8208;assembling dendrimers for multimodality imaging.








Abstract
Bioimaging is a powerful tool for diagnosing tumors but remains limited in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Nanotechnology&#8208;based imaging probes able to accommodate abundant imaging units with different imaging modalities are particularly promising for overcoming these limitations. In addition, the nanosized imaging agents can specifically increase the contrast of tumors by exploiting the enhanced permeability and retention effect. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study is performed on pancreatic cancer to demonstrate the use of modular amphiphilic dendrimer&#8208;based nanoprobes for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MRI) or MR/near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) multimodality imaging. Specifically, the self&#8208;assembly of an amphiphilic dendrimer bearing multiple Gd3+ units at its terminals, generates a nanomicellar agent exhibiting favorable relaxivity for MRI with a good safety profile. MRI reveals an up to two&#8208;fold higher contrast enhancement in tumors than in normal muscle. Encapsulating the NIRF dye within the core of the nanoprobe yields an MR/NIRF bimodal imaging agent for tumor detection that is efficient both for MRI, at Gd3+ concentrations 1/10 the standard clinical dose, and for NIRF imaging, allowing over two&#8208;fold stronger fluorescence intensities. These self&#8208;assembling dendrimer nanosystems thus constitute effective probes for MRI and MR/NIRF multimodality imaging, offering a promising nanotechnology platform for elaborating multimodality imaging probes in biomedical applications.

         <title>Revealing the Deposition Mechanism of the Powder Aerosol Deposition Method Using Ceramic Oxide Core&#8211;Shell Particles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The deposition mechanism of the powder aerosol deposition (PAD) method is still not fully understood. To tackle this issue, two different core&#8211;shell particles are deposited: Al2O3 particles with a SiO2 shell and LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (NMC) particles with a LiNbO3 shell. Comparing the core&#8208;to&#8208;shell element ratio before and after deposition allows to reveil the deposition mechanism of the PAD.








Abstract
The powder aerosol deposition (PAD) method is a process to manufacture ceramic films completely at room temperature. Since the first reports by Akedo in the late 1990s, much research has been conducted to reveal the exact mechanism of the deposition process. However, it is still not fully understood. This work tackles this challenge using core&#8211;shell particles. Two coated oxides, Al2O3 core with a SiO2 shell and&#160;LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 core with a LiNbO3 shell, are investigated. Initially, the element ratios Al:Si and Ni:Nb of the powder are determined by energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDX). In a second step, the change in the element ratios of Al:Si and Ni:Nb after deposition is investigated. The element ratios from powder to film strongly shift toward the shell elements, indicating that the particles fracture and only the outer parts of the particles are deposited. In the last step, this work investigates cross&#8208;sections of the deposited films with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM combined with EDX and an energy&#8208;selective back&#8208;scattered electron (EsB) detector to unveil the element distribution within the film itself. Therefore, the following overall picture emerges: particles impact on the substrate or on previously deposited particle, fracture, and only a small part of the impacting particles that originate from the outer part of the impacting particle gets deposited.

         <title>Pseudopolymorphic Phase Engineering for Improved Thermoelectric Performance in Copper Sulfides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A material consisting of the same substance can crystalize in different structural phases with (or without) identical composition, termed &#8220;(pseudo)polymorphic phases&#8221; (PPs). This work applies this PP concept to copper sulfides to improve thermoelectric performance. The resulting PPs maintain electron transport and enhance phonon scattering. A peak ZT value of 1.25 is obtained, which is 2.3 times higher than that of pristine copper sulfide.








Abstract
Polymorphism (and its extended form &#8211; pseudopolymorphism) in solids is ubiquitous in mineralogy, crystallography, chemistry/biochemistry, materials science, and the pharmaceutical industries. Despite the difficulty of controlling (pseudo&#8208;)polymorphism, the realization of specific (pseudo&#8208;)polymorphic phases and associated boundary structures is an efficient route to enhance material performance for energy conversion and electromechanical applications. Here, this work applies the pseudopolymorphic phase (PP) concept to a thermoelectric copper sulfide, Cu2&#8208;xS (x &#8804; 0.25), via CuBr2 doping. A peak ZT value of 1.25 is obtained at 773&#160;K in Cu1.8S + 3&#160;wt% CuBr2, which is 2.3 times higher than that of a pristine Cu1.8S sample. Atomic&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy confirms the transformation of pristine Cu1.8S low digenite into PP&#8208;engineered high digenite, as well as the formation of (semi&#8208;)coherent interfaces between different PPs, which is expected to enhance phonon scattering. The results demonstrate that PP engineering is an effective approach for achieving improved thermoelectric performance in Cu&#8208;S compounds. It is also expected to be useful in other materials.

         <title>Robust Molecular Anodes for Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation Based on Electropolymerized Molecular Cu Complexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electropolymerization of thiophene monomer, containing a covalently attached Cu molecular water oxidation catalyst, on graphitic surfaces generates powerful and robust molecular anodes. Turnover numbers higher than 11&#160;000 are achieved for the oxygen evolution reaction at low overpotentials of &#8776;250&#160;mV.








Abstract
A multistep synthesis of a new tetra&#8208;amidate macrocyclic ligand functionalized with alkyl&#8208;thiophene moieties, 15,15&#8208;bis(6&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)hexyl)&#8208;8,13&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5H&#8208;dibenzo[b,h][1,4,7,10]tetraazacyclotridecine&#8208;6,7,14,16(15H,17H)&#8208;tetraone, H4L, is reported. The reaction of the deprotonated ligand, L4&#8722;, and Cu(II) generates the complex [LCu]2&#8722;, that can be further oxidized to Cu(III) with iodine to generate [LCu]&#8722;. The H4L ligand and their Cu complexes have been thoroughly characterized by analytic and spectroscopic techniques (including X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy, XAS). Under oxidative conditions, the thiophene group of [LCu]2&#8722; complex polymerizes on the surface of graphitic electrodes (glassy carbon disks (GC), glassy carbon plates (GCp), carbon nanotubes (CNT), or graphite felts (GF)) generating highly stable thin films. With CNTs deposited on a GC by drop casting, hybrid molecular materials labeled as GC/CNT@p&#8208;[LCu]2&#8722; are obtained. The latter are characterized by electrochemical techniques that show their capacity to electrocatalytically oxidize water to dioxygen at neutral pH. These new molecular anodes achieve current densities in the range of 0.4&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 1.30&#160;V versus NHE with an onset overpotential at &#8776;250&#160;mV. Bulk electrolysis experiments show an excellent stability achieving TONs in the range of 7600 during 24&#160;h with no apparent loss of catalytic activity and maintaining the molecular catalyst integrity, as evidenced by electrochemical techniques and XAS spectroscopy.

         <title>Space&#8208;Confined Synthesis of Monolayer Graphdiyne in MXene Interlayer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolayer graphdiyne is synthesized by in situ acetylenic homocoupling of hexaethynylbenzene within the sub&#8208;nanometer interlayer space of Mxene. Free&#8208;standing monolayer graphdiyne flakes with micrometer&#8208;scale lateral are exfoliated from MXene interlayer assisted with ion intercalation. The free&#8208;standing monolayer graphdiyne presents excellent electronic properties which are superior to various previously reported multilayer graphdiyne materials.








Abstract
Graphdiyne (GDY) is an artificial carbon allotrope that is conceptually similar to graphene but composed of sp&#8208; and sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms. Monolayer GDY (ML&#8208;GDY) is predicted to be an ideal 2D semiconductor material with a wide range of applications. However, its synthesis has posed a significant challenge, leading to difficulties in experimentally validating theoretical properties. Here, it is reported that in situ acetylenic homocoupling of hexaethynylbenzene within the sub&#8208;nanometer interlayer space of MXene can effectively prevent out&#8208;of&#8208;plane growth or vertical stacking of the material, resulting in ML&#8208;GDY with in&#8208;plane periodicity. The subsequent exfoliation process successfully yields free&#8208;standing GDY monolayers with micrometer&#8208;scale lateral dimensions. The fabrication of field&#8208;effect transistor on free&#8208;standing ML&#8208;GDY makes the first measurement of its electronic properties possible. The measured electrical conductivity (5.1 &#215; 103 S m&#8722;1) and carrier mobility (231.4 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) at room temperature are remarkably higher than those of the previously reported multilayer GDY materials. The space&#8208;confined synthesis using layered crystals as templates provides a new strategy for preparing 2D materials with precisely controlled layer numbers and long&#8208;range structural order.

Here, it is reported that in situ acetylenic homocoupling of hexaethynylbenzene within the sub-nanometer interlayer space of MXene can effectively prevent out-of-plane growth or vertical stacking of the material, resulting in ML-GDY with in-plane periodicity. The subsequent exfoliation process successfully yields free-standing GDY monolayers with micrometer-scale lateral dimensions. The fabrication of field-effect transistor on free-standing ML-GDY makes the first measurement of its electronic properties possible. The measured electrical conductivity (5.1 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; S m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and carrier mobility (231.4 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) at room temperature are remarkably higher than those of the previously reported multilayer GDY materials. The space-confined synthesis using layered crystals as templates provides a new strategy for preparing 2D materials with precisely controlled layer numbers and long-range structural order.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phenylboronic Acid Functionalized Calix[4]pyrrole&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Supramolecular Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible solid supramolecular electrolyte that blends a new anion capture agent with poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) matrix has been prepared. This electrolyte demonstrates high ionic conductivity (1.9&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 60 &#176;C) and a high Li+ transference number of 0.70. Assembled Li|C4P&#8208;PEO&#8208;LiTFSI|LiFePO4 cells maintains a high&#8208;performance level through 1200 cycles at 60 &#176;C and 1 C.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) suffer from the low ionic conductivity and poor capability of suppressing lithium (Li) dendrites, which limits their utility in the preparation of all solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). It is reported here a flexible solid supramolecular electrolyte that incorporates a new anion capture agent, namely a phenylboronic acid functionalized calix[4]pyrrole (C4P), into a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) matrix. The resulting solid&#8208;state supramolecular electrolyte demonstrates high ionic conductivity (1.9&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 60&#160;&#176;C) and a high Li+ transference number (tLi+${t}_{{\mathrm{Li}}^{\mathrm{ + }}}$&#160;=&#160;0.70). Furthermore, the assembled Li|C4P&#8208;PEO&#8208;LiTFSI|LiFePO4 cell allows for stable cycling over 1200 cycles at 1 C at 60&#160;&#176;C, as well as good rate performance. The favorable performance of the C4P&#8208;PEO&#8208;LiTFSI SPE leads to suggest it can prove useful in the creation of high energy density solid&#8208;state LMBs.

         <title>Multiscale Interpenetrated/Interconnected Network Design Confers All&#8208;Carbon Aerogels with Unprecedented Thermomechanical Properties for Thermal Insulation under Extreme Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spatially confined assembly strategy for multiscale nanocarbon building blocks is proposed to decouple stress and heat transfer. The best thermomechanical and insulation trade&#8208;off is achieved, exhibiting flyweight density, temperature&#8208;invariant elasticity, and a low thermal conductivity (0.04829 W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;1 at 300 &#176;C), which provides a remarkable thermal protection material in hostile environments for future aerospace exploration.








Abstract
With ultralight weight, low thermal conductivity, and extraordinary high&#8208;temperature resistance, carbon aerogels hold tremendous potential against severe thermal threats encountered by hypersonic vehicles during the in&#8208;orbit operation and re&#8208;entry process. However, current 3D aerogels are plagued by irreconcilable contradictions between adiabatic and mechanical performance due to monotonicity of the building blocks or uncontrollable assembly behavior. Herein, a spatially confined assembly strategy of multiscale low&#8208;dimensional nanocarbons is reported to decouple the stress and heat transfer. The nanofiber framework, a basis for transferring the loading strain, is covered by a continuous thin&#8208;film&#8208;like layer formed by the aggregation of nanoparticles, which in combination serve as the fundamental structural units for generating an elastic behavior while yielding compartments in aerogels to suppress the gaseous fluid thermal diffusion within distinct partitions. The resulting all&#8208;carbon aerogels with a hierarchical cellular structure and quasi&#8208;closed cell walls achieve the best thermomechanical and insulation trade&#8208;off, exhibiting flyweight density (24&#160;mg cm&#8722;3), temperature&#8208;constant compressibility (&#8722;196&#8211;1600 &#176;C), and a low thermal conductivity of 0.04&#160;829&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at 300 &#176;C. This strategy provides a remarkable thermal protection material in hostile environments for future aerospace exploration.

         <title>High&#8208;Toughness and High&#8208;Strength Solvent&#8208;Free Linear Poly(ionic liquid) Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;toughness linear poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) elastomers are constructed by supramolecular ionic networks formed by radical polymerization of halometallate ionic liquids (ILs), without any chemical crosslinking. The linear PIL elastomers with good crack propagation insensitive self&#8208;healing, recyclable, and antimicrobial properties have shown broad application prospects in the field of flexible sensor devices, health monitoring, and human&#8211;machine interaction.








Abstract
Solvent&#8208;free elastomers, unlike gels, do not suffer from solvent evaporation and leakage in practical applications. However, it is challenging to realize the preparation of high&#8208;toughness (with both high stress and strain) ionic elastomers. Herein, high&#8208;toughness linear poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) elastomers are constructed via supramolecular ionic networks formed by the polymerization of halometallate ionic liquid (IL) monomers, without any chemical crosslinking. The obtained linear PIL elastomers exhibit high strength (16.5 MPa), Young's modulus (157.49 MPa), toughness (130.31 MJ m&#8722;3), and high crack propagation insensitivity (fracture energy 243.37 kJ m&#8722;2), owing to the enhanced intermolecular noncovalent interactions of PIL chains. Furthermore, PIL elastomer&#8208;based strain, pressure, and touch sensors have shown high sensitivity. The linear noncovalent crosslinked network endows the PIL elastomers with self&#8208;healing and recyclable properties, and broad application prospects in the fields of flexible sensor devices, health monitoring, and human&#8211;machine interaction.

         <title>High&#8208;Stable Lead&#8208;Free Solar Cells Achieved by Surface Reconstruction of Quasi&#8208;2D Tin&#8208;Based Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reconstructing Sn&#8208;based perovskite's surface is able to form a protective gradient layer with exceptional electron transfer, defect passivation, and suppressed Sn(II) oxidation. This strategy enhances perovskite film's and device's environmental endurance even after prolonged exposure to moisture and ambient conditions, offering valuable insights for fabricating robust lead&#8208;free perovskite photovoltaic devices.








Abstract
Tin halide perovskites are an appealing&#160;alternative to lead perovskites. However, owing to the lower redox potential of Sn(II)/Sn(IV), particularly under the presence of oxygen and water, the accumulation of Sn(IV) at the surface layer will negatively impact the device's performance and stability. To this end, this work has introduced a novel multifunctional molecule, 1,4&#8208;phenyldimethylammonium dibromide diamine (phDMADBr), to form a protective layer on the surface of Sn&#8208;based perovskite films. Strong interactions between phDMADBr and the perovskite surface improve electron transfer, passivating uncoordinated Sn(II), and fortify against water and oxygen. In situ grazing incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS) analysis confirms the enhanced thermal stability of the quasi&#8208;2D phase, and hence the overall enhanced stability of the perovskite. Long&#8208;term stability in devices is achieved, retaining over 90% of the original efficiency for more than 200 hours in a 10% RH moisture N2 environment. These findings propose a new approach to enhance the operational stability of Sn&#8208;based perovskite devices, offering a strategy in advancing lead&#8208;free optoelectronic applications.

These findings propose a new approach to enhance the operational stability of Sn-based perovskite devices, offering a strategy in advancing lead-free optoelectronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Core&#8211;Shell Design of Metastable Phase Catalyst Enables Highly&#8208;Performance Selective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The core&#8211;shell design of metastable phase nickel (Ni) catalyst achieves a beyond platinum&#8208;group metal performance with exhibiting approaching 100% conversion rate and selectivity, good stability, and a high TOF of 8241.8 h&#8722;1. The introduction of Ag core leads to electron transfer, and more oxidation states on the catalyst surface, which is conducive to H2 dissociation and phenylacetylene adsorption.








Abstract
Highly selective semihydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes is a highly important reaction for catalytic industry. Developing non&#8208;noble metal based catalysts with platinum group metal&#8208;like activity and selectivity is extremely crucial yet challenging. Metastable phase catalysts provide a potential candidate to realize high activity, yet the control of selectivity remains an open question. Here, this work first reports a metastable phase core&#8211;shell: face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) phase Ag (10 at%) core&#8208;metastable hexagonal closest packed (hcp) phase Ni (90 at%) shell catalyst, which represents high conversion rate, high selectivity, and remarkable universality for the semihydrogenation of phenylacetylene and its derivatives. More impressively, a turnover frequency (TOF) value of 8241.8 h&#8722;1 is achieved, much higher than those of stable phase catalysts and reported platinum group metal based catalysts. Mechanistic investigation reveals that the surface of hcp Ni becomes more oxidized due to electron transfer from hcp Ni shell to fcc Ag core, which decreases the adsorption capacity of styrene on the metastable phase Ni surface, thus preventing full hydrogenation. This work has gained crucial research significance for the design of high performance metastable phase catalysts.

         <title>Lewis Acid Driving Asymmetric Interfacial Electron Distribution to Stabilize Active Species for Efficient Neutral Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A built&#8208;in electric field between Ni&#8208;FeWO4 and WO3 simultaneously achieves the electron&#8208;rich state of the Fe sites in tungstate and improvement of the local reaction environment to suppress Fe leaching and accelerate mass transfer during neutral water oxidation, which endows the membrane electrode assembly constructed of Ni&#8208;FeWO4@WO3/NF with low cell voltages and robust stability for neutral seawater electrolysis.








Abstract
Neutral oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with unique reactive environments exhibits extremely slow reaction kinetics, posing significant challenges in the design of catalysts. Herein, a built&#8208;in electric field between the tungstate (Ni&#8208;FeWO4) with adjustable work function and Lewis acid WO3 is elaborately constructed to regulate asymmetric interfacial electron distribution, which promotes electron accumulation of Fe sites in the tungstate. This decelerates the rapid dissolution of Fe under the OER potentials, thereby retaining the active hydroxyl oxide with the optimized OER reaction pathway. Meanwhile, Lewis acid WO3 enhances hydroxyl adsorption near the electrode surface to improve mass transfer. As expected, the optimized Ni&#8208;FeWO4@WO3/NF self&#8208;supporting electrode achieves a low overpotential of 235 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 in neutral media and maintains stable operation for 200 h. Furthermore, the membrane electrode assembly constructed by such self&#8208;supporting electrode exhibits robust stability for 250 h during neutral seawater electrolysis. This work deepens the understanding of the reconstruction of OER catalysts in neutral environments and paves the way for development of the energy conversion technologies.

         <title>Two&#8208;Color Amplified Spontaneous Emission from Auger&#8208;Suppressed Quantum Dots in Liquids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;color amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) is achieved using liquid suspension of colloidal quantum dots (QDs) under quasicontinuous excitation with nanosecond pulses. Key to this success is the development of compact compositionally&#8208;graded QDs that feature strong suppression of nonradiative multiexciton Auger recombination. ASE from both the band&#8208;edge (1S) and the excited&#8208;state (1P) transitions is simultaneously observed.








Abstract
Colloidal quantum&#8208;dot (QD) lasing is normally achieved in close&#8208;packed solid&#8208;state films, as a high QD volume fraction is required for stimulated emission to outcompete fast Auger decay of optical&#8208;gain&#8208;active multiexciton states. Here a new type of liquid optical&#8208;gain medium is demonstrated, in which compact compositionally&#8208;graded QDs (ccg&#8208;QDs) that feature strong suppression of Auger decay are liquefied using a small amount of solvent. Transient absorption measurements of ccg&#8208;QD liquid suspensions reveal broad&#8208;band optical gain spanning a wide spectral range from 560 (green) to 675&#160;nm (red). The gain magnitude is sufficient to realize a two&#8208;color amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) at 637 and 594&#160;nm due to the band&#8208;edge (1S) and the excited&#8208;state (1P) transition, respectively. Importantly, the ASE regime is achieved using quasicontinuous excitation with nanosecond pulses. Furthermore, the ASE is highly stable under prolonged excitation, which stands in contrast to traditional dyes that exhibit strong degradation under identical excitation conditions. These observations point toward a considerable potential of high&#8208;density ccg&#8208;QD suspensions as liquid, dye&#8208;like optical gain media that feature readily achievable spectral tunability and stable operation under intense photoexcitation.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Induced Degradation in Blue Quantum&#8208;Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is revealed that the accumulation of electrons within the quantum&#8208;dots (QDs) is responsible for the degradation of blue quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes. On the one hand, the accumulated electrons induce the detachment of oleic acid ligands, leading to permanent damage to the stability of QDs. On the other hand, the accumulated electrons leak into the hole transport layer (HTL), leading to the degradation of HTL.








Abstract
The poor stability of blue quantum&#8208;dot (QD) light&#8208;emitting diodes (B&#8208;QLEDs) hinders their application in displays. To improve the stability of B&#8208;QLEDs, the degradation mechanism should be revealed. Here, the degradation mechanism of B&#8208;QLEDs is investigated by monitoring the changes occurring in the QDs and the hole transport layers (HTL) during device operation, respectively. It is revealed that the accumulation of electrons within the QDs is responsible for the degradation of the devices. On the one hand, the accumulated electrons induce the detachment of oleic acid ligands, leading to permanent damage to the stability of B&#8208;QDs. On the other hand, the accumulated electrons leak into the HTL or recombine at the HTL/QDs interface, leading to the degradation of HTL. The formation of surface defects in B&#8208;QDs and the decomposition of HTL contribute to the degradation of B&#8208;QLEDs. The results reveal the strong dependence of B&#8208;QLEDs stability on the accumulated electrons, the QDs and the HTL, which can help researchers to develop effective design strategies for improving the lifespan of B&#8208;QLEDs.

         <title>Rapid Synthesis of Trimetallic Nanozyme for Sustainable Cascaded Catalytic Therapy via Tumor Microenvironment Remodulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid and facile method to synthesize acidity&#8208;responsive trimetallic nanozyme (AMCc) under the combined action of tannic acid and ascorbic acid is attempted first. The unprecedented nanozyme AMCc with excellent peroxidase&#8208;like, catalase&#8208;like, and glucose oxidase&#8208;like activity can be used for glutathione depletion and substrates self&#8208;supply and achieve self&#8208;replenishing and self&#8208;reinforcing cascaded catalytic starvation/photothermal&#8208;enhanced chemodynamic synergistic therapy via tumor microenvironment remodulation.








Abstract
Tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive nanozyme&#8208;catalyzed cancer therapy shows great potential due to its specificity and efficiency. However, breaking the self&#8208;adaption of tumors and improving the sustainable remodeling TME ability remains a major challenge for developing novel nanozymes. Here, a rapid method is developed first to synthesize unprecedented trimetalic nanozyme (AuMnCu, AMC) with a targeting peptide (AMCc), which exhibits excellent peroxidase&#8208;like, catalase&#8208;like, and glucose oxidase&#8208;like activities. The released Cu and Mn ions in TME consume endogenous H2O2 and produce O2, while the&#160;AMCccatalyzes glucose oxidation reaction to generate H2O2 and gluconic acid, which achieves the starvation therapy by depleting the energy and enhances the chemodynamic therapy effect by lowering the pH of the TME and producing extra H2O2. Meanwhile, the reactive oxygen species damage is amplified, as AMCc can constantly oxidize intracellular reductive glutathione through the cyclic valence alternation of Cu and Mn ions, and the generated Cu+ elevate the production of &#183;OH from H2O2. Further studies depict that the well&#8208;designed AMCc exhibits the excellent photothermal performance and achieves TME&#8208;responsive sustainable starvation/photothermal&#8208;enhanced chemodynamic synergistic effects in vitro and in vivo. Overall, a promising approach is demonstrated here to design &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; nanozyme for theranostics by remodeling the TME.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Deficient Perovskites Greatly Enhance the Electrocatalytic Activity for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite oxide (LCMO64) experiences a calcium&#8208;leaching during electrochemical reaction processes, leading to the creation of abundant cation vacancies and enhanced electrochemical surface area, resulting in an elevated electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction reactions.








Abstract
Many perovskite oxides (ABO3) are considered the most promising alternatives to noble metal catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to their high intrinsic activities. However, their electrocatalytic performance is often limited by poor electrical conductivity and low specific surface area. Here an electrochemically induced calcium&#8208;leaching process is reported to greatly increase the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of La0.6Ca0.4MnO3 (LCMO64). The ECSA of the activated, Ca&#8208;deficient LCMO64 is &#8776;33.84% higher than that of the unactivated materials, demonstrating superior electrocatalytic ORR performance to the benchmark commercial Pt/C catalyst in an alkaline solution. Theoretical analysis coupled with electrochemical surface state probing and pH&#8208;dependent microkinetic modeling suggests that this catalyst with the identified most favorable state under ORR operating conditions reaches the Sabatier optimum of alkaline ORR. This reconstructed LCMO64 is among the best&#8208;performing ORR catalysts ever reported, providing new insights into the design of advanced perovskite materials with optimal surface chemistry.

         <title>A Gate&#8208;Tunable Ambipolar Quantum Phase Transition in a Topological Excitonic Insulator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a 2D topological excitonic insulator, band inversion and spin orbit coupling give rise to quantum spin Hall (QSH) state, in which the insulating bulk state is formed/stabilized by the excitonic pairing among electrons and holes near the Fermi level. It presents direct evidence for excitonic pairing in a QSH system WTe2 through a gate&#8208;tunable ambipolar quantum phase transition.








Abstract
Coulomb interactions among electrons and holes in 2D semimetals with overlapping valence and conduction bands can give rise to a correlated insulating ground state via exciton formation and condensation. One candidate material in which such excitonic state uniquely combines with non&#8208;trivial band topology are atomic monolayers of tungsten ditelluride (WTe2), in which a 2D topological excitonic insulator (2D TEI) forms. However, the detailed mechanism of the 2D bulk gap formation in WTe2, in particular with regard to the role of Coulomb interactions, has remained a subject of ongoing debate. Here, it shows that WTe2 is susceptible to a gate&#8208;tunable quantum phase transition, evident from an abrupt collapse of its 2D bulk energy gap upon ambipolar field&#8208;effect doping. Such gate tunability of a 2D TEI, into either n&#8208; and p&#8208;type semimetals, promises novel handles of control over non&#8208;trivial 2D superconductivity with excitonic&#160;pairing.

         <title>Non&#8208;Polaritonic Effects in Cavity&#8208;Modified Photochemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong light&#8208;matter coupling might modify material properties including chemical processes. Here, the first vacuum&#8208;modified chemistry experiment, studying cavity&#8208;modified photochemistry, is re&#8208;examined. Changes in photoisomerization rate are explained by the absorption of ultraviolet radiation in the cavity with no evidence that these changes need to be attributed to strong coupling. This work highlights the importance of systematic experimentation to rule out non&#8208;polaritonic effects.








Abstract
Strong coupling of molecules to vacuum fields is widely reported to lead to modified chemical properties such as reaction rates. However, some recent attempts to reproduce infrared strong coupling results have not been successful, suggesting that factors other than strong coupling may sometimes be involved. In the first vacuum&#8208;modified chemistry experiment, changes to a molecular photoisomerization process in the ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectral range are attributed to strong coupling of the molecules to visible light. Here, this process is re&#8208;examined, finding significant variations in photoisomerization rates consistent with the original work. However, there is no evidence that these changes need to be attributed to strong coupling. Instead, it is suggested that the photoisomerization rates involved are most strongly influenced by the absorption of ultraviolet radiation in the cavity. These results indicate that care must be taken to rule out non&#8208;polaritonic effects before invoking strong coupling to explain any changes of properties arising in cavity&#8208;based&#160;experiments.

         <title>Programming Anisotropic Functionality of 3D Microdenticles by Staggered&#8208;Overlapped and Multilayered Microarchitectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To mimic natural sharkskin exhibiting drag reduction and providing a flexible yet strong armor, microfabrication of multilayered 3D sharkskin comprising polymeric composites is suggested. 3D artificial sharkskin has staggered&#8208;overlapped and multilayered architectures with riblet&#8208;textured microdenticles which exhibit programmed anisotropic multifunction including drag reduction anisotropy, friction anisotropy, mechanical robustness, structural recovery, and Joule heating with a low electrical resistance.








Abstract
Natural sharkskin features staggered&#8208;overlapped and multilayered architectures of riblet&#8208;textured anisotropic microdenticles, exhibiting drag reduction and providing a flexible yet strong armor. However, the artificial fabrication of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) sharkskin with these unique functionalities and mechanical integrity is a challenge using conventional techniques. In this study, it is reported on the facile microfabrication of multilayered 3D sharkskin through the magnetic actuation of polymeric composites and subsequent chemical shape fixation by casting thin polymeric films. The fabricated hydrophobic sharkskin, with geometric symmetry breaking, achieves anisotropic drag reduction in frontal and backward flow directions against the riblet&#8208;textured microdenticles. For mechanical integrity, hard&#8208;on&#8208;soft multilayered mechanical properties are realized by coating the polymeric sharkskin with thin layers of zinc oxide and platinum, which have higher hardness and recovery behaviors than the polymer. This multilayered hard&#8208;on&#8208;soft sharkskin exhibits friction anisotropy, mechanical robustness, and structural recovery. Furthermore, coating the MXene nanosheets provides the fabricated sharkskin with a low electrical resistance of &#8776;5.3 &#937;, which leads to high Joule heating (&#8776;229.9&#160;&#176;C at 2.75&#160;V). The proposed magnetomechanical actuation&#8208;assisted microfabrication strategy is expected to facilitate the development of devices requiring multifunctional microtextures.

The fabricated hydrophobic sharkskin, with geometric symmetry breaking, achieves anisotropic drag reduction in frontal and backward flow directions against the riblet-textured microdenticles. For mechanical integrity, hard-on-soft multilayered mechanical properties are realized by coating the polymeric sharkskin with thin layers of zinc oxide and platinum, which have higher hardness and recovery behaviors than the polymer. This multilayered hard-on-soft sharkskin exhibits friction anisotropy, mechanical robustness, and structural recovery. Furthermore, coating the MXene nanosheets provides the fabricated sharkskin with a low electrical resistance of &#8776;5.3 &#937;, which leads to high Joule heating (&#8776;229.9&#160;&#176;C at 2.75&#160;V). The proposed magnetomechanical actuation-assisted microfabrication strategy is expected to facilitate the development of devices requiring multifunctional microtextures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Ultrahigh Modulus Gel Electrolytes Reforming the Growing Pattern of Li Dendrites for Interfacially Stable Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) with an elastic modulus of GPa magnitude is developed by incorporating an integrated Li7La3Zr2O12 framework into a polymer host. Experiments and numerical modeling jointly reveal that the as&#8208;proposed GPE endows lithium&#8208;metal batteries with a stable interface by constructing a continuous percolation network and reforming the growing pattern of lithium dendrites at a mechanical level.








Abstract
Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) have aroused intensive attention for their moderate comprehensive performances in lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). However, GPEs with low elastic moduli of MPa magnitude cannot mechanically regulate the Li deposition, leading to recalcitrant lithium dendrites. Herein, a porous Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) framework (PLF) is employed as an integrated solid filler to address the intrinsic drawback of GPEs. With the incorporation of PLF, the composite GPE exhibits an ultrahigh elastic modulus of GPa magnitude, confronting Li dendrites at a mechanical level and realizing steady polarization at high current densities in Li||Li cells. Benefiting from the compatible interface with anodes, the LFP|PLF@GPE|Li cells deliver excellent rate capability and cycling performance at room temperature. Theoretical models extracted from the topology of solid fillers reveal that the PLF with unique 3D structures can effectively reinforce the gel phase of GPEs at the nanoscale via providing sufficient mechanical support from the load&#8208;sensitive direction. Numerical models are further developed to reproduce the multiphysical procedure of dendrite propagation and give insights into predicting the failure modes of LMBs. This work quantitatively clarifies the relationship between the topology of solid fillers and the interface stability of GPEs, providing guidelines for designing mechanically reliable GPEs for LMBs.

         <title>Hexagonal Boron Nitride Slab Waveguides for Enhanced Spectroscopy of Encapsulated 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, optical coupling of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) to hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) slab waveguides is studied. The hBN encapsulation provides a pristine dielectric environment around the TMD, while simultaneously providing optical access via waveguiding. The work comprises combined experimental and theoretical approaches, offering essential details necessary to leverage hBN slab waveguides in future research and applications.








Abstract
The layered insulator hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a critical substrate that brings out the exceptional intrinsic properties of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). In this work, the authors demonstrate how hBN slabs tuned to the correct thickness act as optical waveguides, enabling direct optical coupling of light emission from encapsulated layers into waveguide modes. Molybdenum selenide (MoSe2) and tungsten selenide (WSe2) are integrated within hBN&#8208;based waveguides and demonstrate direct coupling of photoluminescence emitted by in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane transition dipoles (bright and dark excitons) to slab waveguide modes. Fourier plane imaging of waveguided photoluminescence from MoSe2 demonstrates that dry etched hBN edges are an effective out&#8208;coupler of waveguided light without the need for oil&#8208;immersion optics. Gated photoluminescence of WSe2 demonstrates the ability of hBN waveguides to collect light emitted by out&#8208;of&#8208;plane dark excitons.Numerical simulations explore the parameters of dipole placement and slab thickness, elucidating the critical design parameters and serving as a guide for novel devices implementing hBN slab waveguides. The results provide a direct route for waveguide&#8208;based interrogation of layered materials, as well as a way to integrate layered materials into future photonic devices at arbitrary positions whilst maintaining their intrinsic properties.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered and Self&#8208;Healable Extraocular&#8208;Muscle&#8208;Like Actuator Based on Dielectric Elastomer Actuator and Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>

A medical aid system combining with a self&#8208;powered extraocular&#8208;muscle&#8208;like actuator and a flexible capacitive sensor is constructed based on a self&#8208;healable dielectric elastomer actuator and a triboelectric nanogenerator, making it promising for using in disease control and prevention for patients suffering from permanent oculomotor nerve palsy through assisting eye movement and monitoring muscle movement.








Abstract
Although dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are promising artificial muscles for use as visual prostheses in patients with oculomotor nerve palsy (ONP), high driving voltage coupled with vulnerable compliant electrodes limits their safe long&#8208;term service. Herein, a self&#8208;healable polydimethylsiloxane compliant electrode based on reversible imine bonds and hydrogen bonds is prepared and coated on an acrylic ester film to develop a self&#8208;healable DEA (SDEA), followed by actuation with a high&#8208;output triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) to construct a self&#8208;powered DEA (TENG&#8208;SDEA). Under 135.9&#160;kV&#160;mm&#8722;1, the SDEA exhibits an elevated actuated strain of 50.6%, comparable to the actuation under DC power. Moreover, the mechanically damaged TENG&#8208;SDEA displays a self&#8208;healing efficiency of over 90% for 10 cycles. The TENG ensures the safe using of TENG&#8208;SDEAs and an extraocular&#8208;muscle&#8208;like actuator with oriented motion ability integrated by several TENG&#8208;SDEAs is constructed. Additionally, the SDEA is directly used as a flexible capacitive sensor for real&#8208;time monitoring of the patient's muscle movement. Accordingly, a medical aid system based on a conjunction of the extraocular&#8208;muscle&#8208;like actuator and a flexible capacitive sensor is manufactured to help the patients suffering from ONP with physical rehabilitation and treatment.

Utilizing sugar&#8208;derived carbon as a dense matrix to replace petrochemicals preparing C/C composites, and this matrix exhibit a nanocrystalline graphite structure with excellent thermal stability. Sugar&#8208;derived carbon matrix C/C composite show excellent ablative resistance at 3000&#160;&#176;C and 10 MW m&#8722;2 heat flux. In addition, the S&#8211;C/C is suitabile for the preparation of a large and complex shaped thermal protection component.








Abstract
Sugars are renewable resources essential to human life, but they are rarely used as raw materials for the industrial production of carbon&#8208;based materials, especially for the preparation of carbon fiber&#8208;reinforced carbon&#8208;matrix (C/C) composites, which are extremely useful for the semiconductor and aerospace sectors. Herein, a method utilizing sugar&#8208;derived carbon to replace petrochemicals as dense matrix to preparing C/C composites is reported. The matrix from sugar&#8208;derived C/C (S&#8211;C/C) composites has a nanocrystalline graphite structure that is highly thermally stable and effectively bonded to the carbon fibers. The mechanical properties of the S&#8211;C/C composite are comparable to those prepared from petrochemical sources; significantly, it exhibits a linear ablation rate of 0.03 mm s&#8722;1 after 200 s of ablation at 3000&#160;&#176;C in 10 MW m&#8722;2 heat flux. This new class of S&#8211;C/C is promising for use in a broad range of fields, ranging from semiconductor to aerospace.

         <title>Turing Instability of Liquid&#8211;Solid Metal Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generalized Turing&#8208;instability mechanism utilizing liquid metal (GaX)&#8208;solid metal (Y film) reaction&#8208;diffusion systems has been disclosed. By designing GaX metal pairs owing appropriate reaction kinetics and diffusion coefficients with Y, labyrinths, stripes, and spots&#8208;like Turing structures can spontaneously emerge and evolve.








Abstract
The classical Turing morphogenesis often occurs in nonmetallic solution systems due to the sole competition of reaction and diffusion processes. Here, this work conceives that gallium (Ga) based liquid metals (LMs) possess the ability to alloy, diffuse, and react with a range of solid metals (SMs) and thus should display Turing instability leading to a variety of nonequilibrium spatial concentration patterns. This work discloses a general mechanism for obtaining labyrinths, stripes, and spots&#8208;like stationary Turing patterns in the LM&#8211;SM reaction&#8208;diffusion systems (GaX&#8208;Y), taking the gallium indium alloy and silver substrate (GaIn&#8208;Ag) system as a proof of concept. It is only when Ga atoms diffuse over Y much faster than X while X reacts with Y preferentially, that Turing instability occurs. In such a metallic system, Ga serves as an inhibitor and X as an activator. The dominant factors in tuning the patterning process include temperature and concentration. Intermetallic compounds contained in the Turing patterns and their competitive reactions have also been further clarified. This LM Turing instability mechanism opens many opportunities for constructing microstructure systems utilizing condensed matter to experimentally explore the general morphogenesis process.

         <title>Employing Noble Metal&#8211;Porphyrins to Engineer Robust and Highly Active Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes for Targeted Catalytic Therapy in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of noble metal&#8211;porphyrins based MOFs (MxP, x denoting Ir, Ru, Pt, and Pd) is prepared to fabricate highly active and stable single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SANzymes). Among these, MIrP demonstrates excellent peroxidase&#8208;like activity (685.61 U mg&#8722;1) and chemical stability. Through modification with (&#8722;)&#8208;Epigallocatechin&#8208;3&#8208;Gallate, a targeted SANzyme tailored for EBV&#8208;associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma is engineered.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SANzymes) emerge as promising alternatives to conventional enzymes. However, chemical instability limits their application. Here, a systematic synthesis of highly active and stable SANzymes is presented by leveraging noble metal&#8211;porphyrins. Four noble metal&#8211;porphyrins are successfully synthesized to mimic the active site of natural peroxidases through atomic metal&#8211;N coordination anchored to the porphyrin center. These noble metal&#8211;porphyrins are integrated into a stable and biocompatible Zr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MxP, x denoting Ir, Ru, Pt, and Pd). Among these, MIrP demonstrates superior peroxidase&#8208;like activity (685.61 U mg&#8722;1), catalytic efficiency, and selectivity compared to horseradish peroxidase (267.71 U mg&#8722;1). Mechanistic investigations unveil heightened catalytic activity of MIrP arises from its robust H2O2 adsorption capacity, unique rate&#8208;determining step, and low energy threshold. Crucially, MIrP exhibits remarkable chemical stability under both room temperature and high H2O2 concentrations. Further, through modification with (&#8722;)&#8208;Epigallocatechin&#8208;3&#8208;Gallate, a natural ligand for Epstein&#8211;Barr virus (EBV)&#8208;encoded latent membrane protein 1, targeted SANzyme (MIrPHE) tailored for EBV&#8208;associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma is engineered. This study not only presents an innovative strategy for augmenting the catalytic activity and chemical stability of SANzymes but also highlights the substantial potential of MIrP as a potent nanomedicine for targeted catalytic tumor therapy.

         <title>PCNA as Protein&#8208;Based Nanoruler for Sub&#8208;10&#160;nm Fluorescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emerging super&#8208;resolution microscopy methods achieve sub&#8208;10 nm resolution, necessitating validation on suitable references structures. Here, a protein&#8208;based Imaging Calibration Optical Ruler (PicoRuler) created by site&#8208;specific labeling of PCNA through Genetic Code Expansion and bioorthogonal click chemistry is introduced. The interaction among three fluorophores separated by 6 nm can be analysed by photoswitching fingerprint analysis and their distance resolved via DNA&#8208;PAINT.








Abstract
Super&#8208;resolution microscopy has revolutionized biological imaging enabling direct insight into cellular structures and protein arrangements with so far unmatched spatial resolution. Today, refined single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy methods achieve spatial resolutions in the one&#8208;digit nanometer range. As the race for molecular resolution fluorescence imaging with visible light continues, reliable biologically compatible reference structures will become essential to validate the resolution power. Here, PicoRulers (protein&#8208;based imaging calibration optical rulers), multilabeled oligomeric proteins designed as advanced molecular nanorulers for super&#8208;resolution fluorescence imaging are introduced. Genetic code expansion (GCE) is used to site&#8208;specifically incorporate three noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into the homotrimeric proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) at 6&#160;nm distances. Bioorthogonal click labeling with tetrazine&#8208;dyes and tetrazine&#8208;functionalized oligonucleotides allows efficient labeling of the PicoRuler with minimal linkage error. Time&#8208;resolved photoswitching fingerprint analysis is used to demonstrate the successful synthesis and DNA&#8208;based points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (DNA&#8208;PAINT) is used to resolve 6&#160;nm PCNA PicoRulers. Since PicoRulers maintain their structural integrity under cellular conditions they represent ideal molecular nanorulers for benchmarking the performance of super&#8208;resolution imaging techniques, particularly in complex biological environments.

         <title>Trace Water in Lead Iodide Affecting Perovskite Crystal Nucleation Limits the Performance of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Material purity impacts optoelectronic properties; trace water in chemicals affects perovskite formation, influencing performance. This study unveils the significance of water content in PbI2, affecting crystallization and texture and ultimately decreasing hole mobility. Imbalanced hole&#8211;electron mobility limits device performance. Certified PCEs of 24.3% and 22.9% for small and larger aperture solar cells are achieved by fine&#8208;controlling water content in PbI2.








Abstract
The experimental replicability of highly efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is a persistent challenge faced by laboratories worldwide. Although trace impurities in raw materials can impact the experimental reproducibility of high&#8208;performance PSCs, the in situ study of how trace impurities affect perovskite film growth is never investigated. Here, light is shed on the impact of inevitable water contamination in lead iodide (PbI2) on the replicability of device performance, mainly depending on the synthesis methods of PbI2. Through synchrotron&#8208;based structure characterization, it is uncovered that even slight additions of water to PbI2 accelerate the crystallization process in the perovskite layer during annealing. However, this accelerated crystallization also results in an imbalance of charge&#8208;carrier mobilities, leading to a degradation in device performance and reduced longevity of the solar cells. It is also found that anhydrous PbI2 promotes a homogenous nucleation process and improves perovskite film growth. Finally, the PSCs achieve a remarkable certified power conversion efficiency of 24.3%. This breakthrough demonstrates the significance of understanding and precisely managing the water content in PbI2 to ensure the experimental replicability of high&#8208;efficiency PSCs.

         <title>Multilevel Gradient&#8208;Ordered Silicon Anode with Unprecedented Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silicon generally exhibits inactive practical sodium storage. This study revives and maximizes the sodium storage activity of pure silicon by atomic ordered structural regulation and provides novel insights into the sodium storage mechanism. Furthermore, the design strategy demonstrates universality in other inert and low&#8208;capacity anode. The multilevel gradient&#8208;ordered silicon shows unprecedented performance and navigates new strategy for high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
While cost&#8208;effective sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) with crystalline silicon anodes promise high theoretical capacities, they perform poorly because silicon stores sodium ineffectively (capacity &lt;40 mAh g&#8722;1). To address this issue, herein an atomic&#8208;order structural&#8208;design tactic is adopted for obtaining unique multilevel gradient&#8208;ordered silicon (MGO&#8208;Si) by simple electrochemical reconstruction. In situ&#8208;formed short&#8208;range&#8208;, medium&#8208;range&#8208;, and long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered structures construct a stable MGO&#8208;Si, which contributes to favorable Na&#8211;Si interaction and fast ion diffusion channels. These characteristics afford a high reversible capacity (352.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1) and stable cycling performance (95.2% capacity retention after 4000 cycles), exhibiting record values among those reported for pure silicon electrodes. Sodium storage of MGO&#8208;Si involves an adsorption&#8211;intercalation mechanism, and a stepwise construction strategy of gradient&#8208;ordered structure further improves the specific capacity (339.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1). Reconstructed Si/C composites show a high reversible capacity of 449.5 mAh g&#8722;1, significantly better than most carbonaceous anodes. The universality of this design principle is demonstrated for other inert or low&#8208;capacity materials (micro&#8208;Si, SiO2, SiC, graphite, and TiO2), boosting their capacities by 1.5&#8211;6 times that of pristine materials, thereby providing new solutions to facilitate sodium storage capability for better&#8208;performing battery designs.

         <title>Topological Hydrogels for Long&#8208;Term Brain Signal Monitoring, Neuromodulation, and Stroke Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A neural probe is fabricated using mechanically interlocked topological hydrogels to acquire brain neural information and conduct neuromodulation. Optogenetic neuromodulation is conducted on stroke rats using the probe, which effectively reduces the infarct regions of the brain tissue and promotes locomotor function recovery.








Abstract
Stroke is the primary cause of disability without effective rehabilitation methods. Emerging brain&#8211;machine interfaces offer promise for regulating brain neural circuits and promoting the recovery of brain function disorders. Implantable probes play key roles in brain&#8211;machine interfaces, which are subject to two irreconcilable tradeoffs between conductivity and modulus match/transparency. In this work, mechanically interlocked polyrotaxane is incorporated into topological hydrogels to solve the two tradeoffs at the molecular level through the pulley effect of polyrotaxane. The unique performance of the topological hydrogels enables them to acquire brain neural information and conduct neuromodulation. The probe is capable of continuously recording local field potentials for eight weeks. Optogenetic neuromodulation in the primary motor cortex to regulate brain neural circuits and control limb behavior is realized using the probe. Most importantly, optogenetic neuromodulation is conducted using the probe, which effectively reduces the infarct regions of the brain tissue and promotes locomotor function recovery. This work exhibits a significant scientific advancement in the design concept of neural probes for developing brain&#8208;machine interfaces and seeking brain disease therapies.

         <title>A Biomimetic Nociceptor Using Centrosymmetric Crystals for Machine Intelligence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic nociceptor with multi&#8208;dimensional mechano&#8208;sensing ability is demonstrated. Centrosymmetric crystal ZGGO:Cr exhibits strong force&#8208;induced electricity and luminescence output, with electrical signals quantitatively evaluating the pain level and the visual luminescence output providing pain site. This biomimetic nociceptor can be integrated with wireless communication module and intelligent analysis module to enable accurate recognition and feedback toward external harmful stimuli.








Abstract
Pain sensation is a crucial aspect of perception in the body. Force&#8208;activated nociceptors encode electrochemical signals and yield multilevel information of pain, thus enabling smart feedback. Inspired by the natural template, multi&#8208;dimensional mechano&#8208;sensing materials provide promising approaches for biomimetic nociceptors in intelligent terminals. However, the reliance on non&#8208;centrosymmetric crystals has narrowed the range of these materials. Here centrosymmetric crystal Cr3+&#8208;doped zinc gallogermanate (ZGGO:Cr) with multi&#8208;dimensional mechano&#8208;sensing is reported, eliminating the limitation of crystal structure. Under forces, ZGGO:Cr generates electrical signals imitating those of neuronal systems, and produces luminescence for spatial mapping of mechanical stimuli, suggesting a path toward bionic pain perception. On that basis, a wireless biomimetic nociceptor system is developed and a smart pain reflex in a robotic hand and robot&#8208;assisted biopsy surgery of rat and dog is achieved.

         <title>NiOx Nanoparticles Hole&#8208;Transporting Layer Regulated by Ionic Radius&#8208;Controlled Doping and Reductive Agent for Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency of 19.18%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic radius&#8208;controlled doping of NiOx nanoparticles&#8208;based HTLs is achieved, resulting in tunable work functions (WFs) and enhanced conductivity. These HTLs are further modified with catechol for use in OSCs, achieving remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 18.42% (PM6:L8&#8208;BO) and 19.18% (D18:N3:F&#8208;BTA3) and setting new records for solution&#8208;processed inorganic nanoparticle HTL&#8208;based OSCs.








Abstract
Nickel oxide (NiOx) has garnered considerable attention as a prospective hole&#8208;transporting layer (HTL) in organic solar cells (OSCs), offering a potential solution to the stability challenges posed by traditional HTL, PEDOT:PSS, arising from acidity and hygroscopicity. Nevertheless, the lower work function (WF) of NiOx relative to donor polymers reduces charge injection efficiency in OSCs. Herein, NiOx nanoparticles are tailored through rare earth doping to optimize WF and the impact of ionic radius on their electronic properties is explored. Lanthanum (La3+) and yttrium (Y3+) ions, with larger ionic radii, are effectively doped at 1 and 3%, respectively, while scandium (Sc3+), with a smaller ion radius, allows enhanced 5% doping. Higher doping ratios significantly enhance WF of NiOx. A 5% Sc3+ doping raises WF to 4.99&#160;eV from 4.77&#160;eV for neat NiOx while maintaining high conductivity. Consequently, using 5% Sc&#8208;doped NiOx as HTL improves the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs to 17.13%, surpassing the 15.64% with the neat NiOx. Further enhancement to 18.42% is achieved by introducing the reductant catechol, outperforming the PEDOT:PSS&#8208;based devices. Additionally, when employed in a ternary blend system (D18:N3:F&#8208;BTA3), an impressive PCE of 19.18&#8201;% is realized, top&#8208;performing among reported OSCs utilizing solution&#8208;processed inorganic nanoparticles.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene)/perovskite (P3HT/PVK) heterointerface is created by using a novel strategy of spinodal decomposition, which effectively alleviates both energy and carrier losses in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). This innovative approach achieves a remarkable 24.53% power conversion efficiency for PSCs.








Abstract
The best research&#8208;cell efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is comparable with that of mature silicon solar cells (SSCs); However, the industrial development of PSCs lags far behind SSCs. PSC is a multiphase and multicomponent system, whose consequent interfacial energy loss and carrier loss seriously affect the performance and stability of devices. Here, by using spinodal decomposition, a spontaneous solid phase segregation process, in situ introduces a poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene)/perovskite (P3HT/PVK) heterointerface with interpenetrating structure in PSCs. The P3HT/PVK heterointerface tunes the energy alignment, thereby reducing the energy loss at the interface; The P3HT/PVK interpenetrating structure bridges a transport channel, thus decreasing the carrier loss at the interface. The simultaneous mitigation of energy and carrier losses by P3HT/PVK heterointerface enables n&#8208;i&#8208;p geometry device a power conversion efficiency of 24.53% (certified 23.94%) and excellent stability. These findings demonstrate an ingenious strategy to optimize the performance of PSCs by heterointerface via Spinodal decomposition.

         <title>Growth of 2D Cr2O3&#8211;CrN Mosaic Heterostructures with Tunable Room&#8208;Temperature Ferromagnetism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D Cr2O3&#8211;CrN mosaic heterostructures consisting of a Cr2O3 flake with embedded CrN subdomains are synthesized by a designed chemical vapor deposition method. These mosaic heterostructures exhibit room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism&#160;that correlates with the interface. By changing the component ratio of CrN and Cr2O3 in mosaic heterostructures, the magnetic properties can be modulated.








Abstract
2D magnets have generated much attention due to their potential for spintronic devices. Heterostructures of 2D magnets are interesting platforms for exploring physical phenomena and applications. However, the controlled growth of 2D room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic heterostructures is challenging. Here, one&#8208;pot chemical vapor deposition growth of stable 2D Cr2O3&#8211;CrN mosaic heterostructures (MHs) is reported with a controlled ratio of components that possess robust room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism. The 2D MHs consist of Cr2O3 flakes with embedded CrN subdomains and the CrN:Cr2O3 ratio can be tuned from 0% to 100% during growth. By changing the CrN:Cr2O3 ratio, the ferromagnetism of the MHs (e.g., saturation magnetization, coercive field), which originates from the interfacial coupling between Cr2O3 and CrN, can be controlled. Importantly, the obtained Cr2O3&#8211;CrN MHs are stable in air at elevated temperatures and have robust ferromagnetism with Curie temperature &gt;400&#160;K. This work presents a facile method for fabricating 2D MHs with tunable magnetism which will benefit high&#8208;temperature spintronics.

         <title>Simultaneous Activation of Pyroptosis and cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway with Epigenetic/ Photodynamic Nanotheranostic for Enhanced Tumor Photoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study provides an exquisite strategy for concurrent photoactivation of pyroptosis and the the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon gene (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway in immunosuppressive tumors to stimulate the innate immunity for subsequent priming of cytotoxic T cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity through cooperative effects of photodynamic therapy and NIR fluorescence imaging mediated by TBE&#8208;loaded NP1 and epigenetic therapy mediated by decitabine&#8208;loaded NP2.








Abstract
Promoting innate immunity through pyroptosis induction or the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon gene (cGAS&#8208;STING)&#160;pathway activation has emerged as a potent approach to counteract the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and elicit systemic antitumor immunity. However, current pyroptosis inducers and STING agonists often suffer from limitations including instability, unpredictable side effects, or inadequate intracellular expression of gasdermin and STING. Here, a tumor&#8208;specific nanotheranostic platform that combines photodynamic therapy (PDT) with epigenetic therapy to simultaneously activate pyroptosis and the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway in a light&#8208;controlled manner is constructed. This approach involves the development of oxidation&#8208;sensitive nanoparticles (NP1) loaded with the photosensitizer TBE, along with decitabine nanomicelles (NP2). NP2 enables the restoration of STING and gasdermin E (GSDME) expression, while NP1&#8208;mediated PDT facilitates the release of DNA fragments from damaged mitochondria to potentiate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, and promotes the activation of caspase&#8208;3 to cleave the upregulated GSDME into pore&#8208;forming GSDME&#8208;N terminal. Subsequently, the released inflammatory cytokines facilitate the maturation of antigen&#8208;presentation cells, triggering T cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity. Overall, this study presents an elaborate strategy for simultaneous photoactivation of pyroptosis and the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, enabling targeted photoimmunotherapy in immunotolerant tumors. This innovative approach holds significant promise in overcoming the limitations associated with existing therapeutic modalities and represents a valuable avenue for future clinical applications.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective strategy is presented to realize circularly polarized organic ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (CP&#8208;OURTP) with an emission decay time of 735&#160;ms and a glumvalue up to 1.49. The CP&#8208;OURTP materials obtain exhibit excellent stability under multiple cycles of photoirradiation and thermal treatment. Moreover, information encryption based on optical multiplexing using the prepared CP&#8208;OURTP materials is demonstrated.








Abstract
Long&#8208;lived room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) of organic materials holds a significant potential for optical information. Circularly polarized organic ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (CP&#8208;OURTP) with extremely high dissymmetry factor (glum) values is even highly demanded and considerably challenging. Here, an effective strategy is introduced to realize CP&#8208;OURTP with an emission decay time of 735&#160;ms and a glum value up to 1.49, which exceeds two orders of magnitude larger than previous records, through a system composed of RTP polymers and chiral helical superstructures. The system exhibits excellent stability under multiple cycles of photoirradiation and thermal treatment, and is further employed for information encryption based on optical multiplexing. The results are anticipated to lay the foundation for the development of CP&#8208;OURTP materials in advanced photonic applications.

Between room&#8208;temperature and &#8722;80 &#176;C, the Li/Cl2 battery delivers up to &#8776;29&#160;100&#8211;4500 mAh g&#8722;1 first discharge capacity (based on carbon mass) and a 1200&#8211;5000 mAh g&#8722;1 reversible capacity over up to 130 charge&#8211;discharge cycles. Mass spectrometry and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy probe Cl2 trapped in the porous carbon upon LiCl electro&#8208;oxidation during charging. At &#8722;80 &#176;C, Cl2/SCl2/S2Cl2 generated by electro&#8208;oxidation in the charging step are trapped in porous KJCO2 carbon, allowing for reversible reduction to afford a high discharge voltage plateau near &#8776;4&#160;V with up to &#8776;1000 mAh g&#8722;1 capacity for SCl2/S2Cl2 reduction and up to &#8776;4000 mAh g&#8722;1 capacity at &#8776;3.1&#160;V plateau for Cl2 reduction.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Effect Coupling for Superior Dielectric and Thermal Conductivity of Polyimide Composite Films Featuring &#8220;Crystal&#8208;Like Phase&#8221; Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the dual action of calcium fluoride and ionic liquid on the polyimide (PI) matrix, the 3D porous thermal conductivity network and special &#8220;crystal&#8208;like phase&#8221; structures are constructed in PI. These endow the PI materials with highly efficient low dielectric and thermal conductivity properties to better serve the electrical and electronic fields.








Abstract
To match the increasing miniaturization and integration of electronic devices, higher requirements are put on the dielectric and thermal properties of the dielectrics to overcome the problems of delayed signal transmission and heat accumulation. Here, a 3D&#160; porous thermal conductivity network is successfully constructed inside the polyimide (PI) matrix by the combination of ionic liquids (IL) and calcium fluoride (CaF2) nanofillers, motivated by the bubble&#8208;hole forming orientation force. Benefiting from the 3D thermal network formed by IL as a porogenic template and &#8220;crystal&#8208;like phase&#8221; structures induced by CaF2&#8208; polyamide acid charge transfer, IL&#8208;10 vol% CaF2/PI porous film exhibits a low permittivity of 2.14 and a thermal conductivity of 7.22 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1. This design strategy breaks the bottleneck that low permittivity and high thermal conductivity in microelectronic systems are difficult to be jointly controlled, and provides a feasible solution for the development of intelligent microelectronics.

         <title>Hierarchical Ohmic Contact Interface Engineering for Efficient Hydrazine&#8208;Assisted Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ohmic contact interface is used as a bridge to connect NiMo and Ni2P, and the integrated NiMo/Ni2P bi&#8208;functional electrocatalyst&#160;is prepared. Charge redistribution optimizes the free energy, and the low energy barrier property provides a fast electron transfer path. The synergy at the interface promotes the catalytic performances, and realizes the low voltage driven hydrazine&#8208;assisted hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Hydrazine oxidation reaction coupled with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is an effective strategy to achieve low energy water splitting for hydrogen production. In order to realize the application of hydrazine&#8208;assisted HER system, researchers have been focusing on the development of electrocatalysts with integrated dual active sites, while the performance under high current density is still unsatisfying. In this work, hierarchical Ohmic contact interface engineering is designed and used as a bridge between the NiMo and Ni2P heterojunction toward industrial current density applications, with the charge transfer impedance greatly eliminated via such a pathway with low energy barrier. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the importance of charge redistribution and energy barrier at the Ohmic contact interface is investigated by significantly reducing the voltage of overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) at high current density. Intriguingly, the NiMo/Ni2P hierarchical Ohmic contact heterojunction can drive current densities of 100 and 500 mA cm&#8722;2 with only 181 and 343 mV cell voltage in the OHzS electrolyzer with high electrocatalytic stability. The proposed hierarchical Ohmic contact interface engineering paves new avenue for hydrogen production with low energy consumption.

         <title>Optimizing the Buried Interface in Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells to Achieve Over 24% Efficiency and Long&#8208;Term Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, by introducing &#9472;NH3+ rich proline hydrochloride as a versatile medium for buried interface in flexible perovskite solar cells, it not only provides a solid &#945;&#8208;phase FAPbI3 template but also prevents the phase transition induced degradation. A new record power conversion efficiency of 24.61% is achieved. Besides, the devices demonstrate excellent shelf&#8208;life/light soaking stability and mechanical stability.








Abstract
The buried interface of the perovskite layer has a profound influence on its film morphology, defect formation, and aging resistance from the outset, therefore, significantly affects the film quality and device performance of derived perovskite solar cells. Especially for FAPbI3, although it has excellent optoelectronic properties, the spontaneous transition from the black perovskite phase to nonperovskite phase tends to start from the buried interface at the early stage of film formation then further propagate to degrade the whole perovskite. In this work, by introducing &#9472;NH3+ rich proline hydrochloride (PF) with a conjugated rigid structure as a versatile medium for buried interface, it not only provides a solid &#945;&#8208;phase FAPbI3 template, but also prevents the phase transition induced degradation. PF also acts as an effective interfacial stress reliever to enhance both efficiency and stability of flexible solar cells. Consequently, a champion efficiency of 24.61% (certified 23.51%) can be achieved, which is the highest efficiency among all reported values for flexible perovskite solar cells. Besides, devices demonstrate excellent shelf&#8208;life/light soaking stability (advanced level of ISOS stability protocols) and mechanical stability.

A high&#8208;efficiency Li intrusion&#8208;blocking interfacial shield is realized for wide&#8208;pressure&#8208;range solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries, consisting of high&#8208;hardness metallic Mo nanocrystals and electrically insulated Li2S. Interfacial shield&#8208;protected Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12&#8208;based cells exhibit significantly enhanced cyclability even at high pressure of 70&#160;MPa.








Abstract
Lithium garnets are considered as promising solid&#8208;state electrolytes for next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries (SSLBs). However, the Li intrusion driven by external stack pressure triggers premature of Li metal batteries. Herein, for the first time, an in situ constructed interfacial shield is reported to efficiently inhibit the pressure&#8208;induced Li intrusion in SSLBs. Theoretical modeling and experimental investigations reveal that high&#8208;hardness metallic Mo nanocrystals inside the shield effectively suppress Li dendrite growth without alloy hardening&#8208;derived interfacial contact deterioration. Meanwhile the electrically insulated Li2S as a shield component considerably promotes interfacial wettability and hinders Li dendrite penetration into the bulk of garnet electrolyte. Interfacial shield&#8208;protected Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO)&#8208;based cells exhibit significantly enhanced cyclability without short circuits under conventional pressures of &#8776;0.2&#160;MPa and even at high pressure of up to 70&#160;MPa; which is the highest endurable stack pressure reported for SSLBs using garnet electrolytes. These key findings are expected to promote the wide&#8208;pressure&#8208;range applications of SSLBs.

         <title>Tethered Small&#8208;Molecule Acceptor Refines Hierarchical Morphology in Ternary Polymer Solar Cells: Enhanced Stability and 19% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ternary&#8208;device design is proposed that fully utilizes the individual thermodynamic properties of both dimeric acceptor and monomeric acceptor. The high Tg value of dimeric acceptor significantly impedes the molecular movement of monomeric acceptor, while hypermiscible properties of monomeric acceptor promote percolation of the mixed domain for enhancing charge dynamics.








Abstract
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) are promising for efficient solar energy conversion, but achieving high efficiency and device longevity within a bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) structure remains a challenge. Traditional small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) in the BHJ blend show thermodynamic instability affecting the morphology. In contrast, tethered SMAs exhibit higher glass transition temperatures, mitigating these concerns. Yet, they might not integrate well with polymer donors, causing pronounced phase separation and overpurification of mixed domains. Herein, a novel ternary device is introduced that uses DY&#8208;P2EH, a tethered dimeric SMA with conjugated side&#8208;chains as host acceptor, and BTP&#8208;ec9, a monomeric SMA as secondary acceptor, which respectively possess hypomiscibility and hypermiscibility with the polymer donor PM6. This unique combination affords a parallel&#8208;connected ternary BHJ blend, leading to a hierarchical and stable morphology. The ternary device achieves a remarkable fill factor of 80.61% and an impressive power conversion efficiency of 19.09%. Furthermore, the ternary device exhibits exceptional stability, retaining over 85% of its initial efficiency even after enduring 1100 h of thermal stress at 85&#160;&#176;C. These findings highlight the potential advantage of tethered SMAs in the design of ternary devices with a refined hierarchical structure for more efficient and durable solar energy conversion technologies.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Data Processing with Memristor Crossbar&#8208;Array&#8208;Based Graph Reservoir</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A physical &#8220;graph reservoir&#8221; is implemented using a metal cell at the diagonal&#8208;crossbar array (mCBA) structure and dynamic self&#8208;rectifying memristors. Spatiotemporal correlation information is extracted from mCBA using a unique mapping method called &#8220;inverted encoding.&#8221; Spatial (image recognition), temporal (time series prediction), and spatiotemporal (attention&#8208;deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) classification) analysis are effectively performed based on the graph reservoir.








Abstract
Memristor&#8208;based physical reservoir computing (RC) is a robust framework for processing complex spatiotemporal data parallelly. However, conventional memristor&#8208;based reservoirs cannot capture the spatial relationship between the time&#8208;varying inputs due to the specific mapping scheme assigning one input signal to one memristor conductance. Here, a physical &#8220;graph reservoir&#8221; is introduced using a metal cell at the diagonal&#8208;crossbar array (mCBA) with dynamic self&#8208;rectifying memristors. Input and inverted input signals are applied to the word and bit lines of the mCBA, respectively, storing the correlation information between input signals in the memristors. In this way, the mCBA graph reservoirs can map the spatiotemporal correlation of the input data in a high&#8208;dimensional feature space. The high&#8208;dimensional mapping characteristics of the graph reservoir achieve notable results, including a normalized root&#8208;mean&#8208;square error of 0.09 in Mackey&#8211;Glass time series prediction, a 97.21% accuracy in MNIST recognition, and an 80.0% diagnostic accuracy in human connectome classification.

         <title>Polymer&#8208;Entangled Spontaneous Pseudo&#8208;Planar Heterojunction for Constructing Efficient Flexible Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The entangled strategy for manipulating the vertical gradient distribution is proposed to trade&#8208;off the efficiency and mechanical properties of flexible organic solar cells. The toughened&#8208;pseudo planar heterojunction (Toughened&#8208;PPHJ) film exhibits excellent tensile resistance, with twice the crack onset strain of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) film (11.0%/5.5%). Meanwhile, the efficiency of Toughened&#8208;PPHJ device is 18.16%, significantly better than BHJ device (16.99%).








Abstract
Flexible organic solar cells (FOSCs) have attracted considerable attention from researchers as promising portable power sources for wearable electronic devices. However, insufficient power conversion efficiency (PCE), intrinsic stretchability, and mechanical stability of FOSCs remain severe obstacles to their application. Herein, an entangled strategy is proposed for the synergistic optimization of PCE and mechanical properties of FOSCs through green sequential printing combined with polymer&#8208;induced spontaneous gradient heterojunction phase separation morphology. Impressively, the toughened&#8208;pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction (Toughened&#8208;PPHJ) film exhibits excellent tensile properties with a crack onset strain (COS) of 11.0%, twice that of the reference bulk heterojunction (BHJ) film (5.5%), which is among the highest values reported for the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymer/small molecule&#8208;based systems. Finite element simulation of stress distribution during film bending confirms that Toughened&#8208;PPHJ film can release residual stress well. Therefore, this optimal device shows a high PCE (18.16%) with enhanced (short&#8208;circuit current density) JSC and suppressed energy loss, which is a significant improvement over the conventional BHJ device (16.99%). Finally, the 1&#160;cm2 flexible Toughened&#8208;PPHJ device retains more than 92% of its initial PCE (13.3%) after 1000 bending cycles. This work provides a feasible guiding idea for future flexible portable power supplies.

Anion Solvation
In article number 2306462, Jijian Xu, Anh T. Ngo, Chunsheng Wang, and co&#8208;workers reveal anion solvation (anion&#8208;solvent interaction) as a new direction to rational design the electrolyte for lithium metal batteries and beyond to achieve high performance. This study completes the understanding of the complex interplay among the electrolyte components (solvents, Li+, anions), which can affect electrolyte bulk properties, alter interfacial reaction paths, and impact the resultant electrochemical performance. The cover image was designed by Linlin Chen.

Tesla Thermo&#8208;Magnetic Motor
A laser beam impinging on a ferrofluid droplet can generate not only a double&#8208;eye vortex of surface thermomagnetic convection but also propel the droplet to spin like a Tesla thermomagnetic engine, which, in turn, causes two other droplets to spin in opposite directions through a thermal bridge. More details can be found in article number 2306756 by Feng Lin, Jiming Bao, Zhiming Wang, and co&#8208;workers.

Collective Motions
In article number 2304759, Yuebing Zheng and co&#8208;workers introduce an experimental platform for customizing motions of active particles, enabling the mimicry of natural collective movements. This platform generates spontaneous, diverse motion patterns in particles through designed interaction rules, dynamically influenced by inherent system perturbations.

2D Materials
In article number 2309777 by Samuel W. LaGasse and co&#8208;workers, optical coupling of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) to hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) slab waveguides is studied. The results provide a direct route for waveguide&#8208;based interrogation of layered materials, as well as a way to integrate layered materials into future photonic devices at arbitrary positions whilst maintaining their intrinsic properties.

Thiomolybdate Clusters
Molecular molybdenum sulfides, or thiomolybdates, are an emerging class of highly active catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction. The article number 2305730 by Carsten Streb, Alexey Cherevan, and co&#8208;workers critically assesses the performance of thiomolybdates under homogeneous and heterogenized conditions, and sheds light on the mechanisms which govern photocatalytic and electrocatalytic reactivity and stability of this compound class.

In article number 2309999, Kai Yue, Xuanze Li, Qian Wang, Jing Liu, and co&#8208;workers disclose a generalized Turing&#8208;instability mechanism utilizing liquid metal (GaX)&#8208;solid metal (Y film) reaction&#8208;diffusion systems. By designing GaX metal pairs owing appropriate reaction kinetics and diffusion coefficients with Y, labyrinths, stripes, and spots&#8208;like Turing structures could spontaneously emerge and evolve. This opens many opportunities for constructing micro&#8208;structure systems utilizing condensed matter to experimentally explore the general morphogenesis process.

         <title>The Distance Between Phosphate&#8208;Based Polyanionic Compounds and Their Practical Application For Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently, sodium&#8208;ion batteries have attracted extensive attention due to the high abundance of sodium resources and low cost. In this review, the development history, recent progress, optimization strategies, and commercialization degree of phosphate&#8208;based polyanionic cathodes for high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries are comprehensively summarized.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are a viable alternative to meet the requirements of future large&#8208;scale energy storage systems due to the uniform distribution and abundant sodium resources. Among the various cathode materials for SIBs, phosphate&#8208;based polyanionic compounds exhibit excellent sodium&#8208;storage properties, such as high operation voltage, remarkable structural stability, and superior safety. However, their undesirable electronic conductivities and specific capacities limit their application in large&#8208;scale energy storage systems. Herein, the development history and recent progress of phosphate&#8208;based polyanionic cathodes are first overviewed. Subsequently, the effective modification strategies of phosphate&#8208;based polyanionic cathodes are summarized toward high&#8208;performance SIBs, including surface coating, morphological control, ion doping, and electrolyte optimization. Besides, the electrochemical performance, cost, and industrialization analysis of phosphate&#8208;based polyanionic cathodes for SIBs are discussed for accelerating commercialization development. Finally, the future directions of phosphate&#8208;based polyanionic cathodes are comprehensively concluded. It is believed that this review can provide instructive insight into developing practical phosphate&#8208;based polyanionic cathodes for SIBs.

This review highlights recent developments in the use of molecular molybdenum sulfide clusters, thiomolybdates as reactive sites in photo&#8208; and electrochemical catalysis. Mechanistic details and comparison of reactivity and stability are reported with a focus on the hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Thiomolybdates are molecular molybdenum&#8208;sulfide clusters formed from Mo centers and sulfur&#8208;based ligands. For decades, they have attracted the interest of synthetic chemists due to their unique structures and their relevance in biological systems, e.g., as reactive sites in enzymes. More recently, thiomolybdates are explored from the catalytic point of view and applied as homogeneous and molecular mimics of heterogeneous molybdenum sulfide catalysts. This review summarizes prominent examples of thiomolybdate&#8208;based electro&#8208; and photocatalysis and provides a comprehensive analysis of their reactivities under homogeneous and heterogenized conditions. Active sites of thiomolybdates relevant for the hydrogen evolution reaction are examined, aiming to shed light on the link between cluster structure and performance. The shift from solution&#8208;phase to surface&#8208;supported thiomolybdates is discussed with a focus on applications in electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. The outlook highlights current trends and emerging areas of thiomolybdate research, ending with a summary of challenges and key takeaway messages based on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art research.

         <title>Polysulfides in Magnesium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive summary of Mg polysulfide chemistry and its impact on Mg&#8208;S battery performance is reviewed. Covered topics include characterization techniques, polysulfide conversion mechanisms, solvent/electrolyte effects, and polysulfide shuttling. Strategies for inhibiting shuttling and catalyzing conversion of Mg polysulfide species, including the design of polysulfide&#8208;trapping materials and dual&#8208;functional catalysts, are discussed.








Abstract
Mg&#8208;S batteries hold great promise as a potential alternative to Li&#8208;based technologies. Their further development hinges on solving a few key challenges, including the lower capacity and poorer cycling performance when compared to Li counterparts. At the heart of the issues is the lack of knowledge on polysulfide chemical behaviors in the Mg&#8208;S battery environment. In this Review, a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of polysulfide behaviors in Mg&#8208;S batteries is provided. First, a systematic summary of experimental and computational techniques for polysulfide characterization is provided. Next, conversion pathways for Mg polysulfide species within the battery environment are discussed, highlighting the important role of polysulfide solubility in determining reaction kinetics and overall battery performance. The focus then shifts to the negative effects of polysulfide shuttling on Mg&#8208;S batteries. The authors outline various strategies for achieving an optimal balance between polysulfide solubility and shuttling, including the use of electrolyte additives, polysulfide&#8208;trapping materials, and dual&#8208;functional catalysts. Based on the current understanding, the directions for further advancing knowledge of Mg polysulfide chemistry are identified, emphasizing the integration of experiment with computation as a powerful approach to accelerate the development of Mg&#8208;S battery technology.

         <title>The Landscape of Biomimetic Nanovesicles in Brain Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides the recent progress on nanotechnology&#8208;integrated biomimetic nanovesicles (BNVs) for brain diseases from various aspects of classification and characterization of BNVs and involved pathophysiological roles, with focus on nanotechnology&#8208;based biomedical applications, including in vitro diagnosis and precise therapeutic regulations, and also outlines the remaining challenges and future perspectives.








Abstract
Brain diseases, such as brain tumors, neurodegenerative diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and brain injuries, are caused by various pathophysiological changes, which pose a serious health threat. Brain disorders are often difficult to treat due to the presence of the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB). Biomimetic nanovesicles (BNVs), including endogenous extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from various cells and artificial nanovesicles, possess the ability to penetrate the BBB and thus can be utilized for drug delivery to the brain. BNVs, especially endogenous EVs, are widely distributed in body fluids and usually carry various disease&#8208;related signal molecules such as proteins, RNA, and DNA, and may also be analyzed to understand the etiology and pathogenesis of brain diseases. This review covers the exhaustive classification and characterization of BNVs and pathophysiological roles involved in various brain diseases, and emphatically focuses on nanotechnology&#8208;integrated BNVs for brain disease theranostics, including various diagnosis strategies and precise therapeutic regulations (e.g., immunity regulation, disordered protein clearance, anti&#8208;neuroinflammation, neuroregeneration, angiogenesis, and the gut&#8211;brain axis regulation). The remaining challenges and future perspectives regarding the nanotechnology&#8208;integrated BNVs for the diagnosis and treatment of brain diseases are also discussed and outlined.

         <title>Rational Design of DNA Hydrogels Based on Molecular Dynamics of Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The macroscopic characteristics of DNA hydrogels can be manipulated by controlling the molecular dynamics of the DNA network at the molecular level, specifically through adjusting the backbone rigidity and crosslinking kinetics. Therefore, DNA hydrogel networks can be designed with precisely tailored macroscopic properties, making DNA hydrogels promising candidates for biomedical applications.








Abstract
In recent years, DNA has emerged as a fascinating building material to engineer hydrogel due to its excellent programmability, which has gained considerable attention in biomedical applications. Understanding the structure&#8211;property relationship and underlying molecular determinants of DNA hydrogel is essential to precisely tailor its macroscopic properties at molecular level. In this review, the rational design principles of DNA molecular networks based on molecular dynamics of polymers on the temporal scale, which can be engineered via the backbone rigidity and crosslinking kinetics, are highlighted. By elucidating the underlying molecular mechanisms and theories, it is aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of how the tunable DNA backbone rigidity and the crosslinking kinetics lead to desirable macroscopic properties of DNA hydrogels, including mechanical properties, diffusive permeability, swelling behaviors, and dynamic features. Furthermore, it is also discussed how the tunable macroscopic properties make DNA hydrogels promising candidates for biomedical applications, such as cell culture, tissue engineering, bio&#8208;sensing, and drug delivery.

         <title>Sustainable Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries beyond Li</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advent of sustainable dual&#8208;ion batteries, utilizing beyond&#8208;Li cations such as K+, Ca2+, Na+, Mg2+, Al3+, Zn2+, NH4+, and H+, holds significant promise for the realization of low&#8208;cost and environmentally friendly large&#8208;scale energy storage solutions. This review describes an extensive overview of the current status, advancements, and future prospects of these new chemistries.








Abstract
The limitations of resources used in current Li&#8208;ion batteries may hinder their widespread use in grid&#8208;scale energy storage systems, prompting the search for low&#8208;cost and resource&#8208;abundant alternatives. &#8220;Beyond&#8208;Li cation&#8221; batteries have emerged as promising contenders; however, they confront noteworthy challenges due to the scarcity of suitable host materials for these cations. In contrast, anions, the other crucial component in electrolytes, demonstrate reversible intercalation capacity in specific materials like graphite. The convergence of anion and cation storage has given rise to a new battery technology known as dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs). This comprehensive review presents the current status, advancements, and future prospects of sustainable DIBs beyond Li. Notably, most DIBs exhibit similar cathode reaction mechanisms involving anion intercalation, while the distinguishing factor lies in the cation types functioning at the anode. Accordingly, the review is organized into sections by various cation types, including Na&#8208;, K&#8208;, Mg&#8208;, Zn&#8208;, Ca&#8208;, Al&#8208;, NH4+&#8208;, and proton&#8208;based DIBs. Moreover, a perspective on these novel DIBs is presented, along with proposed protocols for investigating DIBs and promising future research directions. It is envisioned that this review will inspire fresh concepts, ideas, and research directions, while raising important questions to further tailor and understand sustainable DIBs, ultimately facilitating their practical realization.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent post&#8208;treatment technological reforms toward perovskite thin films are summarized, and the principal functions of the post&#8208;treatment strategies on the design of high&#8208;quality perovskite films are thoroughly analyzed. Then, the latest research progress of thermal annealing (TA)&#8208;related and TA&#8208;free techniques is summarized and discussed.

Abstract
Incredible progress in photovoltaic devices based on hybrid perovskite materials has been made in the past few decades, and a record&#8208;certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 26% has been achieved in single&#8208;junction perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In the fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency PSCs, the postprocessing procedures toward perovskites are essential for designing high&#8208;quality perovskite thin films; developing efficient and reliable post&#8208;treatment techniques is very important to promote the progress of PSCs. Here, recent post&#8208;treatment technological reforms toward perovskite thin films are summarized, and the principal functions of the post&#8208;treatment strategies on the design of high&#8208;quality perovskite films have been thoroughly analyzed by dividing into two categories in this review: thermal annealing (TA)&#8208;related technique and TA&#8208;free technique. The latest research progress of the above two types of post&#8208;treatment techniques is summarized and discussed, focusing on the optimization of postprocessing conditions, the regulation of perovskite qualities, and the enhancement of device performance. Finally, an outlook of the prospect trends and future challenges for the fabrication of the perovskite layer and the production of highly efficient PSCs is given.

         <title>Design Principles of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Oxygen Evolution Reaction: From Targeted Structures to Active Sites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 7, February 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the dynamic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanisms, the research progress, a variety of structural regulation methods of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) to improve the activity and stability, design principles as well as opportunities and challenges of SACs for OER are discussed systematically.








Abstract
Hydrogen production from electrolytic water electrolysis is considered a viable method for hydrogen production with significant social value due to its clean and pollution&#8208;free nature, high hydrogen production efficiency, and purity, but the anode oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process is complex and kinetically slow. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with 100% atom utilization and homogeneous active sites often exhibit high catalytic activity and are expected to be extensively applied. The catalytic performance of OER can be further improved by precise regulation of the structure through electronic effects, coordination environment, heteroatomic&#160;doping, and so on. In this review, the mechanisms of OER under different conditions are introduced, the latest research progress of SACs in the field of OER is systematically summarized, and then the effects of various structural regulation strategies on catalytic performance are discussed, and principles and ideas for the design of SACs for OER are proposed. In the end, the outstanding issues and current challenges in this field are summarized.

Low&#8208;dimensional materials used as polarization&#8208;sensitive components in polarized photodetection and imaging are comprehensively reviewed. From the view of the constitutive relation, polarized photodetectors based on LDMs can be creatively divided into three categories. Based on this, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art works are reorganized, summarized, and analyzed, and perspectives on the future opportunities and challenges are also discussed.








Abstract
The vector characteristics of light and the vectorial transformations during its transmission lay a foundation for polarized photodetection of objects, which broadens the applications of related detectors in complex environments. With the breakthrough of low&#8208;dimensional materials (LDMs) in optics and electronics over the past few years, the combination of these novel LDMs and traditional working modes is expected to bring new development opportunities in this field. Here,&#160;the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress of LDMs, as polarization&#8208;sensitive components in polarized photodetection and even the imaging, is the main focus, with emphasis on the relationship between traditional working principle of polarized photodetectors (PPs) and photoresponse mechanisms of LDMs. Particularly, from the view of constitutive equations, the existing works are reorganized, reclassified, and reviewed. Perspectives on the opportunities and challenges are also discussed.&#160;It is&#160;hoped that this work can provide a more general overview in the use of LDMs in this field, sorting out the way of related devices for &#8220;more than Moore&#8221; or even the &#8220;beyond Moore&#8221; research.

         <title>Nanomedicine Tumor Targeting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanomedicines are extensively explored for cancer therapy. By delivering drug molecules more efficiently to pathological sites and by attenuating their accumulation in healthy organs and tissues, nanomedicine formulations aim to improve the balance between drug efficacy and toxicity. More than 20 cancer nanomedicines are approved for clinical use, and 100&#8242;s of formulations are in (pre)clinical development. Over the years, several key pitfalls have been identified as bottlenecks in nanomedicine tumor targeting and translation. These go beyond materials&#8208; and production&#8208;related issues, and particularly also encompass biological barriers and pathophysiological heterogeneity. In this manuscript, I describe the most important principles, progress and products in nanomedicine tumor targeting, delineate key current problems and challenges, and discuss the most promising future prospects for cancer nanomedicines.

         <title>Layered High&#8208;Entropy Metallic Glasses for Photothermal CO2 Methanation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High entropy alloys and metallic glasses, as two typical metastable nanomaterials, have attracted tremendous interest in energy conversion catalysis due to their high reactivity in nonequilibrium states. Herein, we synthesize a novel nanomaterial, layered high entropy metallic glass (HEMG), in a higher energy state than low&#8208;entropy alloys and its crystalline counterpart due to both the disordered elemental and structural arrangements. Specifically, the MnNiZrRuCe HEMG exhibits highly enhanced photothermal catalytic activity and long&#8208;term stability. An unprecedented CO2 methanation rate of 489&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at 330&#160;&#176;C is achieved, which is, to our knowledge, the highest photothermal CO2 methanation rate in flow reactors. The remarkable activity originates from the abundant free volume and high internal energy state of HEMG, which lead to the extraordinary heterolytic H2 dissociation capacity. The high&#8208;entropy effect also ensures the excellent stability of HEMG for up to 450 hours. Our work not only provides a new perspective on the catalytic mechanism of HEMG, but also sheds light on the great catalytic potential in future carbon&#8208;negative industry.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Enriched Single&#8208;Bi&#8208;Atoms Tailoring of Pt Nanorings for Direct Methanol Fuel Cells with Ultralow&#8208;Pt&#8208;Loading</title>

Abstract
Single&#8208;atom decorating of Pt emerges as a highly effective strategy to boost catalytic properties, which could trigger the most Pt active sites while blocking the smallest number of Pt atoms, enabling unprecedented mass activity. However, the rational design and creation of high&#8208;density single&#8208;atoms on Pt surface remain as a huge challenge. Herein, we report a customized synthesis of surface&#8208;enriched single&#8208;Bi&#8208;atoms tailored Pt nanorings (SE&#8208;Bi1/Pt NRs) toward methanol oxidation, as guided by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggesting that a relatively higher density of Bi species on Pt surface could ensure a CO&#8208;free pathway and accelerate the kinetics of *HCOOH formation. Decorating Pt NRs with dense single&#8208;Bi&#8208;atoms is achieved by starting from PtBi intermetallic nanoplates (NPs) with intrinsically isolated Bi atoms and subsequent etching and annealing treatments. The SE&#8208;Bi1/Pt NRs exhibit a mass activity of 23.77 A mg&#8722;1 Pt toward methanol oxidation in alkaline electrolyte, which is higher than the previously reported values, and more specifically, is 2.2 and 12.8 times higher than those of Pt&#8208;Bi NRs and Pt/C, respectively. This excellent activity endows the SE&#8208;Bi1/Pt NRs with a high likelihood to be used as a practical anodic electrocatalyst for direct methanol fuel cells with high power density of 85.3&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and ultralow Pt loading of 0.39&#160;mg cm&#8722;2.

         <title>PROTAC prodrug&#8208;integrated nanosensitizer for potentiating radiation therapy of cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Radiation therapy (RT) is one of the primary options for clinical cancer therapy, in particular advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Herein, we have revealed the crucial role of bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4 (BRD4)&#8208;RAD51 associated protein 1 (RAD51AP1) axis in sensitizing RT of HNSCC. We herein innovatively engineered a versatile nanosensitizer (RPB7H) by integrating a PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTAC) prodrug (BPA771) and hafnium dioxide (HfO2) nanoparticles to downregulate BRD4&#8208;RAD51AP1 pathway and sensitize HNSCC tumor to RT. Upon intravenous administration, the RPB7H nanoparticles selectively accumulated at the tumor tissue and internalized into tumor cells by recognizing neuropilin&#8208;1 overexpressed in the tumor mass. HfO2 nanoparticles enhanced RT effectiveness by amplifying X&#8208;ray deposition, intensifying DNA damage, and boosting oxidative stress. Meanwhile, BPA771 can be activated by RT&#8208;induced H2O2 secretion to degrade BRD4 and inactivate RAD51AP1, thus impeding RT&#8208;induced DNA damage repair (DDR). This versatile nanosensitizer, combined with X&#8208;ray irradiation, effectively regressed HNSCC tumor growth in a mouse model. Our findings introduce a PROTAC prodrug&#8208;based radiosensitization strategy by targeting the BRD4&#8208;RAD51AP1 axis, might offer a promising avenue to augment RT and more effective HNSCC therapy.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Epigenetically Relieving the MYC&#8208;Correlated Immunosuppression via an Advanced Nano&#8208;Radiosensitizer Potentiates Cancer Immuno&#8208;Radiotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radiotherapy causes patients severe MYC&#8208;mediated immune tolerance. To address this clinical issue, a high&#8208;Z metal&#8211;phenolic nanoradiosensitizer is engineered to dual&#8208;epigenetically downregulate MYC expression and trigger cancer cellular IFN&#8208;I signaling. This tactic significantly enhances the proliferation, intratumoral infiltration, and cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells but decreases the levels of immune suppressors.








Abstract
Cancer cells can upregulate the MYC expression to repair the radiotherapy&#8208;triggered DNA damage, aggravating therapeutic resistance and tumor immunosuppression. Epigenetic treatment targeting the MYC&#8208;transcriptional abnormality may intensively solve this clinical problem. Herein, 5&#8208;Aza (a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor) and ITF&#8208;2357 (a histone deacetylase inhibitor) are engineered into a tungsten&#8208;based nano&#8208;radiosensitizer (PWAI), to suppress MYC rising and awaken robust radiotherapeutic antitumor immunity. Individual 5&#8208;Aza depletes MYC expression but cannot efficiently awaken radiotherapeutic immunity. This drawback can be overcome by the addition of ITF&#8208;2357, which triggers cancer cellular type I interferon (IFN&#8208;I) signaling. Coupling 5&#8208;Aza with ITF&#8208;2357 ensures that PWAI does not evoke the treated model with high MYC&#8208;related immune resistance while amplifying the radiotherapeutic tumor killing, and more importantly promotes the generation of IFN&#8208;I signal&#8208;related proteins involving IFN&#8208;&#945; and IFN&#8208;&#946;. Unlike the radiation treatment alone, PWAI&#8208;triggered immuno&#8208;radiotherapy remarkably enhances antitumor immune responses involving the tumor antigen presentation by dendritic cells, and improves intratumoral recruitment of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and their memory&#8208;phenotype formation in 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mice. Downgrading the radiotherapy&#8208;induced MYC overexpression via the dual&#8208;epigenetic reprogramming strategy may elicit a robust immuno&#8208;radiotherapy.

     alt="Dual-Epigenetically Relieving the MYC-Correlated Immunosuppression via an Advanced Nano-Radiosensitizer Potentiates Cancer Immuno-Radiotherapy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radiotherapy causes patients severe MYC-mediated immune tolerance. To address this clinical issue, a high-Z metal&#8211;phenolic nanoradiosensitizer is engineered to dual-epigenetically downregulate MYC expression and trigger cancer cellular IFN-I signaling. This tactic significantly enhances the proliferation, intratumoral infiltration, and cytotoxicity of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells but decreases the levels of immune suppressors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer cells can upregulate the MYC expression to repair the radiotherapy-triggered DNA damage, aggravating therapeutic resistance and tumor immunosuppression. Epigenetic treatment targeting the MYC-transcriptional abnormality may intensively solve this clinical problem. Herein, 5-Aza (a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor) and ITF-2357 (a histone deacetylase inhibitor) are engineered into a tungsten-based nano-radiosensitizer (PWAI), to suppress MYC rising and awaken robust radiotherapeutic antitumor immunity. Individual 5-Aza depletes MYC expression but cannot efficiently awaken radiotherapeutic immunity. This drawback can be overcome by the addition of ITF-2357, which triggers cancer cellular type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling. Coupling 5-Aza with ITF-2357 ensures that PWAI does not evoke the treated model with high MYC-related immune resistance while amplifying the radiotherapeutic tumor killing, and more importantly promotes the generation of IFN-I signal-related proteins involving IFN-&#945; and IFN-&#946;. Unlike the radiation treatment alone, PWAI-triggered immuno-radiotherapy remarkably enhances antitumor immune responses involving the tumor antigen presentation by dendritic cells, and improves intratumoral recruitment of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and their memory-phenotype formation in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. Downgrading the radiotherapy-induced MYC overexpression via the dual-epigenetic reprogramming strategy may elicit a robust immuno-radiotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Decomposable Nanoagonists Enable NIR&#8208;Elicited cGAS&#8208;STING Activation for Tandem&#8208;Amplified Photodynamic&#8208;Metalloimmunotherapy</title>

Abstract
Activation of the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway has emerged as an efficient strategy to improve the therapeutic outcome of immunotherapy. However, the &#8220;constantly active&#8221; mode of current delivery strategies for STING agonists typically leads to off&#8208;target toxicity and hyperimmunity. To solve this critical issue, we herein construct a metal organic frameworks (MOF)&#8208;based nanoagonist (DZ@A7) featuring tumor&#8208;specific and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;enhanced decomposition for precisely localized STING activation and photodynamic&#8208;metalloimmunotherapy. The engineered nanoagonist enables mitochondria&#8208;targeted reactive oxygen species generation under NIR irradiation to specifically release mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), as well as the inhibition of the repair of nuclear DNA (ncDNA) via hypoxia&#8208;responsive drugs. The oxidized tumor mtDNA serves as an endogenous danger&#8208;associated molecular pattern to activate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. Concurrently, NIR&#8208;accelerated zinc ions overloading in cancer cells further enhances the cGAS enzymatic activity via metallo&#8208;immune effects. By combining the synergistically enhanced activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway triggered by NIR irradiation, the engineered nanoagonist facilitates the maturation of dendritic cells and the infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes for primary tumors eradication, which also establishes a long&#8208;term anti&#8208;tumor immunity to suppress tumor metastasis. Therefore, the developed nanoagonist enables NIR&#8208;triggered, agonist&#8208;free, and tandem&#8208;amplified activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, offering a distinct paradigm of photodynamic&#8208;metalloimmunotherapy.

         <title>PbS Quantum Dots Ink with Months&#8208;Long Shelf&#8208;Lifetime Enabling Scalable and Efficient Short&#8208;Wavelength Infrared Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylammonium lead iodide is used in phase&#8208;transfer ligand exchange of&#160;PbS quantum dots of size up to 6.7 nm. These inks show at least ten&#8208;week shelf&#8208;life time, confirmed by the absorption spectroscopy and the field&#8208;effect transistor performances. Photodetectors fabricate via blade&#8208;coating exhibit 76% external quantum efficiency at 1300&#160;nm and 1.8&#160;&#215;&#160;1012&#160;Jones specific detectivity.








Abstract
The phase&#8208;transfer ligand exchange of PbS quantum dots (QDs) has substantially simplified device fabrication giving hope for future industrial exploitation. However, this technique when applied to QDs of large size (&gt;4&#160;nm) gives rise to inks with poor colloidal stability, thus hindering the development of QDs photodetectors in short&#8208;wavelength infrared range. Here, it is demonstrated that methylammonium lead iodide ligands can provide sufficient passivation of PbS QDs of size up to 6.7&#160;nm, enabling inks with a minimum of ten&#8208;week shelf&#8208;life time, as proven by optical absorption and solution&#8208;small angle X&#8208;ray scattering. Furthermore, the maximum linear electron mobility of 4.7&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 is measured in field&#8208;effect transistors fabricated with fresh inks, while transistors fabricated with the same solution after ten&#8208;week storage retain 74% of the average starting electron mobility, demonstrating the outstanding quality both of the fresh and aged inks. Finally, photodetectors fabricated via blade&#8208;coating exhibit 76% external quantum efficiency at 1300&#160;nm and 1.8&#160;&#215;&#160;1012&#160;Jones specific detectivity, values comparable with devices fabricated using ink with lower stability and wasteful methods such as spin&#8208;coating.

         <title>Three&#8208;in&#8208;One Strategy Enables Single&#8208;Component Organic Solar Cells with Record Efficiency and High Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a facile three&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy by fusing the advantages of ternary blend system and single&#8208;component system for stable and efficient orgainic solar cells. The PM6&#8208;D18&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT&#8208;10&#8208;based three&#8208;in&#8208;one single&#8208;component device not only obtains a breakthrough efficiency of 14.89%, but also displays significantly higher stability than the corresponding two&#8208;component (PM6&#8208;D18:PYIT) and three&#8208;component (PM6:D18:PYIT), including the photostability, storage stability, and thermal stability.








Abstract
Single&#8208;component organic solar cells (SCOSCs) with covalently bonding donor and acceptor are becoming increasingly attractive because of their superior stability over traditional multicomponent blend organic solar cells (OSCs). Nevertheless, the efficiency of SCOSCs is far behind the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art multicomponent OSCs. Herein, by combination of the advantages of three&#8208;component and single&#8208;component devices, this work reports an innovative three&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy to boost the performance of SCOSCs. In this three&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy, three independent components (PM6, D18, and PYIT) are covalently linked together to create a new single&#8208;component active layer based on ternary conjugated block copolymer (TCBC) PM6&#8208;D18&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT by a facile polymerization. Precisely manipulating the component ratios in the polymer chains of PM6&#8208;D18&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT is able to broaden light utilization, promote charge dynamics, optimize, and stabilize film morphology, contributing to the simultaneously enhanced efficiency and stability of the SCOSCs. Ultimately, the PM6&#8208;D18&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT&#8208;based device exhibits a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.89%, which is the highest efficiency of the reported SCOSCs. Thanks to the aggregation restriction of each component and chain entanglement in the three&#8208;in&#8208;one system, the PM6&#8208;D18&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT&#8208;based SCOSC displays significantly higher stability than the corresponding two&#8208;component (PM6&#8208;D18:PYIT) and three&#8208;component (PM6:D18:PYIT). These results demonstrate that the three&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy is facile and promising for developing SCOSCs with superior efficiency and stability.

         <title>Achieving Stable Lithium Anodes through Leveraging Inevitable Stress Variations via Adaptive Piezoelectric Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical failures stemming from substantial volume fluctuations and stress concentration pose formidable challenges for lithium&#8208;metal batteries. To address this, the piezoelectric effect to transform these stresses into robust, responsive, and highly sensitive built&#8208;in electric fields is introduced. This work provides crucial insights in managing mechanical failures, and significantly contributes to characterizing and visualizing latent issues in lithium&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Unleashing the potential of lithium&#8208;metal anodes in practical applications is hindered by the inherent stress&#8208;related challenges arising from their limitless volume expansion, leading to mechanical failures such as electrode cracking, solid electrolyte interphase damage, and dendritic growth.&#160;Despite the various protective strategies to &#8220;combat&#8221; stress in lithium&#8208;metal anodes, they fail to address the intrinsic issue fundamentally. Here, a unique strategy is proposed that leverages the stress generated during the battery cycling via the piezoelectric effect, transforming to the adaptive built&#8208;in electric field to accelerate lithium&#8208;ion migration, homogenize the lithium deposition, and alleviate the stress concentration. The mechanism of the piezoelectric effect in modulating electro&#8208;chemomechanical field evolution is further validated and decoupled through finite element method simulations. Inspired by this strategy, a high sensitivity, fast responsive, and strength adaptability polymer piezoelectric is used to demonstrate the feasibility and the corresponding protected lithium&#8208;metal anode shows cycling stability over 6000&#160;h under a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and extending life in a variety of coin and pouch cell systems. This work effectively tackles the stress&#8208;related issues and decoupling the electro&#8208;chemomechanical field evolution also contributes to developing more stable lithium anodes for future research.

&lt;p&gt;Unleashing the potential of lithium-metal anodes in practical applications is hindered by the inherent stress-related challenges arising from their limitless volume expansion, leading to mechanical failures such as electrode cracking, solid electrolyte interphase damage, and dendritic growth.&#160;Despite the various protective strategies to &#8220;combat&#8221; stress in lithium-metal anodes, they fail to address the intrinsic issue fundamentally. Here, a unique strategy is proposed that leverages the stress generated during the battery cycling via the piezoelectric effect, transforming to the adaptive built-in electric field to accelerate lithium-ion migration, homogenize the lithium deposition, and alleviate the stress concentration. The mechanism of the piezoelectric effect in modulating electro-chemomechanical field evolution is further validated and decoupled through finite element method simulations. Inspired by this strategy, a high sensitivity, fast responsive, and strength adaptability polymer piezoelectric is used to demonstrate the feasibility and the corresponding protected lithium-metal anode shows cycling stability over 6000&#160;h under a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and extending life in a variety of coin and pouch cell systems. This work effectively tackles the stress-related issues and decoupling the electro-chemomechanical field evolution also contributes to developing more stable lithium anodes for future research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Colossal Magnetoresistive Switching Induced by D&#176; Ferromagnetism of MgO in a Semiconductor Nanochannel Device with Ferromagnetic Fe/MgO Electrodes</title>

Abstract
Exploring potential spintronic functionalities in resistive switching (RS) devices is of great interest for creating new applications, such as multifunctional resistive random&#8208;access memory and novel neuromorphic computing devices. In particular, the importance of the spin&#8208;triplet state of cation vacancies in oxide materials, which is induced by localized and strong O&#8211;2p on&#8208;site Coulomb interactions, in RS devices has been overlooked. d&#176; ferromagnetism sometimes appears due to the spin&#8208;triplet state and ferromagnetic Zener's double exchange interactions between cation vacancies, which are occasionally strong enough to make nonmagnetic oxides ferromagnetic. Here, for the first time, anomalous and colossal magneto&#8208;RS (CMRS) with very high magnetic field dependence is demonstrated by utilizing an unconventional RS device composed of a Ge nanochannel with all&#8208;epitaxial single&#8208;crystalline Fe/MgO electrodes. Our device shows colossal and unusual behavior as the threshold voltage and ON/OFF ratio strongly depend on a magnetic field, which is controllable with an applied voltage. This new phenomenon is attributed to the formation of d0&#8208;ferromagnetic filaments by attractive Mg vacancies due to the spin&#8208;triplet states with ferromagnetic double exchange interactions and the ferromagnetic proximity effect of Fe on MgO. Our findings will allow the development of energy&#8208;efficient CMRS devices with multifield susceptibility.

         <title>Enhancing CAR Macrophage Efferocytosis via Surface Engineered Lipid Nanoparticles Targeting LXR Signaling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The removal of dying cells, or efferocytosis, is an indispensable part of resolving inflammation. However, the inflammatory microenvironment of the atherosclerotic plaque frequently affects the biology of both apoptotic cells and resident phagocytes, rendering efferocytosis dysfunctional. To overcome this problem, we developed a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) macrophage that could target and engulf phagocytosis&#8208;resistant apoptotic cells expressing CD47. In both normal and inflammatory circumstances, CAR macrophages exhibited activity equivalent to antibody blockage. The surface of CAR macrophages was modified with Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)&#8208;responsive therapeutic nanoparticles targeting the liver X receptor pathway to improve their cell effector activities. The combination of CAR and nanoparticle engineering activated lipid efflux pumps, enhanced cell debris clearance, and reduced inflammation. We further suggest that the undifferentiated CAR&#8208;Ms can transmigrate within a mico&#8208;fabricated vessel system. We also show our CAR macrophage can act as a Chimeric Switch Receptor (CSR) to withstand the immunosuppressive inflammatory environments through enhanced stimulation via CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; interaction. Based on our current understanding, our developed platform has the potential to contribute to the advancement of next&#8208;generation cardiovascular disease therapies, but further studies, especially in vivo experiments, might be needed to assess its efficacy and safety fully.

         <title>Improve the Charge Carrier Transporting in Two&#8208;Dimensional Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To improve the charge carrier transport in two&#8208;dimensional Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskite solar cells, this review shows the relevant progress from bandgap regulation, phase orientation and distribution, amine molecule selection, and energy level matching from the perspective of 2D perovskite structural properties. Finally, the possible future research directions and methods to achieve efficient and stable perovskite solar cells are rationalized.








Abstract
Conventional 3D organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskite materials have shown substantial potential in the field of optoelectronics, enabling the power conversation efficiency of solar cells beyond 26%. A key challenge limiting the further commercial application of 3D perovskite solar cells is their inherent instability over outer oxygen, humidity, light, and heat. By contrast, 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (2DRP) perovskites with bulky organic cations can effectively stabilize the inorganic slabs, yielding excellent environmental stability. However, the efficiencies of 2DRP perovskite solar cells are much lower than those of the 3D counterparts due to poor charge carrier transporting property of insulating bulky organic cations. Their inner structural, dielectric, optical, and excitonic properties remain to be primarily studied. In this review, the main reasons for the low efficiency of 2DRP perovskite solar cells are first analyzed. Next, a detailed description of various strategies for improving the charge carrier transporting of 2DRP perovskites is provided, such as bandgap regulation, perovskite crystal phase orientation and distribution, energy level matching, interfacial modification, etc. Finally, a summary is given, and the possible future research directions and methods to achieve high&#8208;efficiency and stable 2DRP perovskite solar cells are rationalized.

         <title>Spatial Structure Design of Thioether&#8208;linked Naphthoquinone Cathodes for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Organic electrode materials (OEMs) have gathered extensive attention for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) due to their structural diversity and molecular designability. However, the reported research mainly focuses on the design of the planar configuration of OEMs and does not take into account the important influence of the spatial structure on the electrochemical properties, which seriously hamper the further performance liberation of OEMs. Herein, we have designed a series of thioether&#8208;linked naphthoquinone&#8208;derived isomers with tunable spatial structures and applied them as the cathodes in AZIBs. The incomplete conjugated structure of the elaborately engineered isomers could guarantee the independence of the redox reaction of active groups, which contributes to the full utilization of active sites and high redox reversibility. In addition, the position isomerization of naphthoquinones on the benzene rings changes the zincophilic activity and redox kinetics of the isomers, signifying the importance of spatial structure on the electrochemical performance. As a result, the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;(1,4&#8208;phenylenedithio) bis(1,4&#8208;naphthoquinone) (p&#8208;PNQ) with the smallest steric hindrance and the most independent redox of active sites exhibits a high specific capacity (279 mAh g&#8722;1), an outstanding rate capability (167 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 A g&#8722;1), and a long&#8208;term cycling lifetime (over 2800&#160;h at 0.05 A g&#8722;1).

         <title>Multi&#8208;Interfacial Confined Assembly of Colloidal Quantum Dots Quasi&#8208;Superlattice Microcavities for High&#8208;Resolution Full&#8208;Color Microlaser Arrays</title>

Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are considered a promising material for the next generation of integrated display devices due to their designable optical bandgap and low energy consumption. Owing to their dispersibility in solvents, CQD micro/nanostructures are generally fabricated by solution&#8208;processing methods. However, the random mass transfer in liquid restricts the programmable construction in macroscopy and ordered assembly in microscopy for the integration of CQD optical structures. Herein, we develop a multi&#8208;interfacial confined assembly strategy to fabricate CQDs programmable microstructure arrays with a quasi&#8208;superlattice configuration through controlling the dynamics of three&#8208;phase contact lines (TPCLs). The motion of TPCLs dominates the division of liquid film for precise positioning of CQD microstructures, while pinned TPCLs control the solvent evaporation and concentration gradient to directionally drive the mass transfer and packing of CQDs. Owing to their long&#8208;range order and adjustable structural dimensions, CQD microring arrays function as high&#8208;quality&#8208;factor (high&#8208;Q) lasing resonant cavities with low thresholds and tunable lasing emission modes. Through the further surface treatment and liquid dynamics control, we demonstrate the on&#8208;chip integration of red (R), green (G), and blue (B) multi&#8208;component CQD microlaser arrays. Our technique establishes a new route to fabricate large&#8208;area, ultrahigh&#8208;definition and full&#8208;color CQD laser displays.

         <title>150 Gbps THz Chipscale Topological Photonic Diplexer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Photonic diplexers are being widely investigated for high data transfer rates in on&#8208;chip communication. However, dividing the available spectrum into non&#8208;overlapping multicarrier frequency sub&#8208;bands has remained a challenge in designing frequency&#8208;selective time&#8208;invariant channels. Here, we report an on&#8208;chip topological diplexer exhibiting terahertz frequency band filtering through Klein tunnelling of topological edge modes. The silicon topological diplexer chip facilitates two high&#8208;speed channels with quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) over a broad bandwidth of 12.5 GHz each. These channels operate at carrier frequencies of 305 GHz and 321.6 GHz, achieving a combined diplexer capacity of 150 Gbit/s. To ensure minimal interference between adjacent channels, a guard band is implemented. Topologically protected edge modes suppress the frequency selective fading of the broadband signals and hold promise for diverse integrated photonic applications spanning terahertz and telecommunication realms, including the design of lossless topological multiplexers, interconnects, antennas, and modulators for the sixth to X generation (6G to XG) wireless.

         <title>Electric Field Switching of Magnon Spin Current in a Compensated Ferrimagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Manipulation of directional magnon propagation, known as magnon spin current, is essential for developing magnonic devices featuring nonvolatile functionalities and ultralow power consumption. Magnon spin current can usually be modulated by magnetic field or current&#8208;induced spin torques. However, these approaches may lead to energy dissipation due to Joule heating. Electric&#8208;field switching of magnon spin current without charge current is highly preferred but challenging to realize. By integrating magnonic and piezoelectric materials, we demonstrate the manipulation of the magnon spin current generated by the spin Seebeck effect in the ferrimagnetic insulator Gd3Fe5O12 (GdIG) film on a piezoelectric substrate. We observe reversible electric&#8208;field switching of magnon polarization without applied charge current. Through strain&#8208;mediated magnetoelectric coupling, the electric field induces the magnetic compensation transition between two magnetic states of the GdIG, resulting in its magnetization reversal and the simultaneous switching of magnon spin current. Our work establishes a prototype material platform that pave the way for developing magnon logic devices characterized by all electric field reading and writing and reveals the underlying physics principles of their functions.

         <title>Backside Coating for Stable Zn Anode with High Utilization Rate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Stable Zn anodes with high utilization rate are urgently required to promote the specific and volumetric energy densities of Zn&#8208;ion batteries for practical applications. Herein, contrary to the widely utilized surface coating on Zn anodes, we show that a zinc foil with a backside coated layer delivers much enhanced cycling stability even under high depth of discharge. The backside coating significantly reduces stress concentration, accelerates heat diffusion and facilitates electron transfer, thus effectively prevents dendrite growth and structural damage at high Zn utilization. As a result, the developed anode can be stably cycled for 334&#160;h at 85.5%&#160;Zn utilization, which outperforms bare Zn and previously reported results on surface&#8208;coated Zn foils. An NVO&#8208;based full cell also shows stable performance with high Zn utilization (69.4%), low negative&#8208;positive electrodes ratio (1.44) and high specific/volumetric energy densities (155.8&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1/178&#160;Wh L&#8722;1), which accelerates the progress toward practical zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Triphenylamine Spiro&#8208;functionalized Light&#8208;emitting Conjugated Polymer with an Ultra&#8208;Deep&#8208;Blue Narrowband Emission for Large&#8208;area Printed Display</title>

Abstract
Emerging printed large&#8208;area polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) are essential for manufacturing flat&#8208;panel displays and solid lighting devices. However, it is challenging to obtain large&#8208;area and stable ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue PLEDs because of the lack of light&#8208;emitting conjugated polymers (LCPs) with robust deep&#8208;blue emissions, excellent morphological stabilities, and high charging abilities. In this study, a novel unsymmetrically substituted polydiarylfluorene (POPSAF) was obtained with stable narrowband emission for large&#8208;area printed displays via triphenylamine (TPA) spiro&#8208;functionalization of LCPs. POPSAF films show narrowband and stable ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue emission with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 36&#160;nm, associated with their intrachain excitonic behavior without obvious polaron formation. Compared to controlled PODPF, excellent charge transport was observed in the POPSAF films because of the intrinsic hole transport ability of the TPA units. Large&#8208;area PLEDs were fabricated via blade&#8208;coating with an emission area of 16 cm2, which exhibited uniform ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue emission with a FWHM of 36&#160;nm and corresponding Commission internationale de l&#8217;&#233;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.155, 0.072). These findings were attributed to the synergistic effects of robust emission, stable morphology, and printing capacity. Finally, preliminary printed passive matrix PLED displays with 20 &#215; 20 pixels monochromes were fabricated, confirmed the effectiveness of spiro&#8208;functionalization in optoelectronics.

         <title>Engineering Biomaterials to Model Immune&#8208;Tumour Interactions In Vitro</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Engineered biomaterial scaffolds are becoming more prominent in research laboratories to study drug efficacy for oncological applications in vitro, but do they have a place in pharmaceutical drug screening pipelines? The low efficacy of cancer drugs in phase II/III clinical trials suggests that there are critical mechanisms not properly accounted for in the pre&#8208;clinical evaluation of drug candidates. Immune cells associated with the tumour may account for some of these failures given recent successes with cancer immunotherapies; however, there are few representative platforms to study immune cells in the context of cancer as traditional 2D culture is typically monocultures and humanized animal models have a weakened immune composition. Biomaterials that replicate tumour microenvironmental cues may provide a more relevant model with greater in vitro complexity. In this review, we explore the pertinent microenvironmental cues which drive tumour progression in the context of the immune system, discuss how these cues can be incorporated into hydrogel design to culture immune cells, and describe progress toward precision oncological drug screening with engineered tissues.

         <title>Sulfur Vacancies and 1T Phase&#8208;Rich MoS2 Nanosheets as an Artificial Solid Electrolyte Interphase for 400&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1 Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

Abstract
Constructing large&#8208;area artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to suppress Li dendrites growth and electrolyte consumption is essential for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8208;metal batteries. Herein, chemically exfoliated ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets (EMoS2) as an artificial SEI are scalable transfer&#8208;printed on Li&#8208;anode (EMoS2@Li). The EMoS2 with large amount of sulfur vacancies and 1T phase&#8208;rich acts as a lithiophilic interfacial ion&#8208;transport skin to reduce the Li nucleation overpotential and regulate Li+ flux. With favorable Young's modulus and homogeneous continuous layered structure, the proposed EMoS2@Li effectively suppresses the growth of Li dendrites and repeat breaking/reforming of the SEI. As a result, the assembled EMoS2@Li||LiFePO4 and EMoS2@Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 batteries demonstrate a high&#8208;capacity retention of 93.5% and 92% after 1,000 cycles and 300 cycles, respectively at ultrahigh cathode loading of 20&#160;mg cm&#8211;2. Ultrasonic transmission technology confirms the admirable ability of EMoS2@Li to inhibit Li dendrites in practical pouch batteries. Remarkably, the Ah&#8208;class EMoS2@Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch battery exhibits an energy density of 403&#8201;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 over 100 cycles with the low negative/positive capacity ratio of 1.8 and electrolyte/capacity ratio of 2.1&#8201;g Ah&#8722;1. The strategy of constructing an artificial SEI by sulfur vacancies&#8208;rich and 1T phase&#8208;rich ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets provide a new guidance to realize high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries with long cycling stability.

The EMoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with large amount of sulfur vacancies and 1T phase-rich acts as a lithiophilic interfacial ion-transport skin to reduce the Li nucleation overpotential and regulate Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; flux. With favorable Young's modulus and homogeneous continuous layered structure, the proposed EMoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@Li effectively suppresses the growth of Li dendrites and repeat breaking/reforming of the SEI. As a result, the assembled EMoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@Li||LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and EMoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@Li||LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries demonstrate a high-capacity retention of 93.5% and 92% after 1,000 cycles and 300 cycles, respectively at ultrahigh cathode loading of 20&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Ultrasonic transmission technology confirms the admirable ability of EMoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@Li to inhibit Li dendrites in practical pouch batteries. Remarkably, the Ah-class EMoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@Li||LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pouch battery exhibits an energy density of 403&#8201;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; over 100 cycles with the low negative/positive capacity ratio of 1.8 and electrolyte/capacity ratio of 2.1&#8201;g Ah&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The strategy of constructing an artificial SEI by sulfur vacancies-rich and 1T phase-rich ultrathin MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets provide a new guidance to realize high-energy-density lithium metal batteries with long cycling stability.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Electrolytes Design for Extending the Temperature Adaptability of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: from Fundamentals to Strategies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
With the continuously growing demand for wide&#8208;range applications, lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have been increasingly required to work under conditions that deviate from room temperature. However, commercial electrolytes exhibit low thermal stability at high temperatures and poor dynamic properties at low temperatures, hindering the operation of LIBs under extreme conditions. The bottleneck restricting the practical applications of LIBs has promoted researchers to pay more attention to developing a series of innovative electrolytes. This review primarily covers the design of electrolytes for LIBs from a temperature adaptability perspective. Firstly, we elaborate on the fundamentals of electrolytes concerning temperature, including donor number, dielectric constant, viscosity, conductivity, ionic transport, and theoretical calculations. Secondly, prototypical examples, such as lithium salts, solvent structures, additives, and interfacial layers in both liquid and solid electrolytes, are presented to explain how these factors can affect the electrochemical behavior of LIBs at high or low temperatures. Meanwhile, the principles and limitations of electrolyte design are discussed under the corresponding temperature conditions. Finally, a summary and outlook regarding electrolyte design to extend the temperature adaptability of LIBs are proposed.

         <title>Polymorphic Self&#8208;Assembly with Procedural Flexibility for Monodisperse Quaternary Protein Structures of DegQ Enzymes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
As large molecular tertiary structures, some proteins can act as small robots that find, bind, and chaperone target protein clients, showing the potential to serve as smart building blocks in self&#8208;assembly fields. Instead of using such intrinsic functions, most self&#8208;assembly methodologies for proteins aim for de novo&#8208;designed structures with accurate geometric assemblies, which could limit procedural flexibility. Here, we present a strategy enabling polymorphic clustering of quaternary proteins, exhibiting simplicity and flexibility of self&#8208;assembling paths for proteins in forming monodisperse quaternary cage particles. We propose that the enzyme protomer DegQ, previously solved at low resolution, may potentially be usable as a threefold symmetric building block, which can form polyhedral cages incorporated by the chaperone action of DegQ in the presence of protein clients. To obtain highly monodisperse cage particles, we utilize soft, and hence, less resistive client proteins, which can program the inherent chaperone activity of DegQ to efficient formations of polymorphic cages, depending on the size of clients. By reconstructing the atomic resolution cryo&#8208;EM DegQ structures using obtained 12&#8208; and 24&#8208;meric clusters, we validate the polymorphic clustering of DegQ enzymes in terms of soft and rigid domains, which would provide effective routes for protein self&#8208;assemblies with procedural flexibility.

         <title>Materiobiomodulated ROS Therapy for De Novo Hair Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hair loss is characterized by the inability of hair follicles to enter the telogen&#8208;anagen transition (TAT) and lack of de novo hair follicles (HFs). Current pharmaceutical therapies and surgical modalities have been largely limited to regulating hair regrowth efficiently without side effects and lacking treatment compliance. Here we propose a materiobiomodulation therapy (MBMT), wherein polydopamine (PDA) nanoparticles with redox activity can be modulated to have a stoichiometric ROS (H2O2) donating ability. These nanoparticles can intracellularly deliver ROS with high&#8208;efficiency via the clathrin&#8208;dependent endocytosis process. Utilizing homozygote transgenic HyPerion (a genetically&#8208;encoded H2O2 biosensor) mice, we also achieve in vivo dynamic monitoring of intracellular H2O2 elevation induced by ROS donators. Subcutaneous administration with ROS donators results in rapid onset of TAT and subsequent hair regrowth with a specific ROS &#8220;hormesis effect&#8221;. Mechanistically, ROS activate &#946;&#8208;catenin&#8208;dependent Wnt signaling, upregulating hair follicle stem cell (HFSC) expression. We further developed a microneedles patch for transdermal ROS delivery, demonstrating long&#8208;term, low&#8208;dose ROS release. Unlike photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT), MBMT requires no external stimuli, providing a convenient and efficient approach for clinical hair loss treatment. This material&#8208;HF communication implicates new avenues in HF&#8208;related diseases, achieving targeted ROS delivery with minimal side effects.

         <title>Blood&#8208;Brain Barrier&#8208;Penetrating and Lesion&#8208;Targeting Nanoplatforms Inspired by the Pathophysiological Features for Synergistic Ischemic Stroke Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ischemic stroke is a dreadful vascular disorder that poses enormous threats to the public health. Due to its complicated pathophysiological features, current treatment options after ischemic stroke attack remains unsatisfactory. Insufficient drug delivery to ischemic lesions impeded by the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) largely limits the therapeutic efficacy of most anti&#8208;stroke agents. Herein, inspired by the rapid BBB penetrability of 4T1 tumor cells upon their brain metastasis and natural roles of platelet in targeting injured vasculatures, a bio&#8208;derived nanojacket was developed by fusing 4T1 tumor cell membrane with platelet membrane, which further clothed on the surface of paeonol and polymetformin&#8208;loaded liposome to obtain biomimetic nanoplatforms (PP@PCL) for ischemic stroke treatment. The designed PP@PCL could remarkably alleviate ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury by efficiently targeting ischemic lesion, preventing neuroinflammation, scavenging excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), reprogramming microglia phenotypes, and promoting angiogenesis due to the synergistic therapeutic mechanisms that anchor the pathophysiological characteristics of ischemic stroke. As a result, PP@PCL exerted desirable therapeutic efficacy in injured PC12 neuronal cells and rat model of ischemic stroke, which significantly attenuated neuronal apoptosis, reduced infarct volume, and recovered neurological functions, bringing new insights into exploiting promising treatment strategies for cerebral ischemic stroke management.

         <title>Tempospatially Confined Catalytic Membranes for Advanced Water Remediation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The application of homogeneous catalysts in water remediation is limited by factors such as their excessive chemical and energy input, weak regenerability, and potential leaching. Heterogeneous catalytic membranes (CMs) offer a new approach to facilitating efficient, selective, and continuous pollutant degradation. Thus, integrating membranes and continuous filtration with heterogeneous advanced oxidation processes can promote thermodynamic and kinetic mass transfers in spatially confined intrapores and facilitate diffusion&#8208;reaction processes. Despite the remarkable advantages of heterogeneous CMs, their engineering application has been practically restricted due to the fuzzy design criteria for specific applications. Herein, we critically review the recent advances in CMs for advanced water remediation and propose the design flow for tempospatially confined CMs. Further, we review state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art CM materials and their catalytic mechanisms, after which we emphasize the tempospatial confinement mechanisms comprising the nanoconfinement effect, interface effect, and kinetic mass transfer, thus clarifying their roles in the construction and performance optimization of CMs. Additionally, we summarize the fabrication methods for CMs based on their catalysts and pore sizes and present an overview of their application and performance evaluations. Finally, we present future directions for CMs in materials research and water treatment.

         <title>Enabling Proregenerative Medical Devices via Citrate&#8208;Based Biomaterials: Transitioning from Inert to Regenerative Biomaterials</title>

This perspective reviews the history and applications of biodegradable polymers used in medical devices marketed in the United States of America, highlights the need and requirements for regenerative biomaterials, and discusses the path behind the recent successful introduction of citrate&#8208;based biomaterials for the manufacture of innovative medical products aimed at improving the outcome of musculoskeletal surgeries.








Abstract
Regenerative medicine aims to restore tissue and organ function without the use of prosthetics and permanent implants. However, achieving this goal has been elusive, and the field remains mostly an academic discipline with few products widely used in clinical practice. From a materials science perspective, barriers include the lack of proregenerative biomaterials, a complex regulatory process to demonstrate safety and efficacy, and user adoption challenges. Although biomaterials, particularly biodegradable polymers, can play a major role in regenerative medicine, their suboptimal mechanical and degradation properties often limit their use, and they do not support inherent biological processes that facilitate tissue regeneration. As of 2020, nine synthetic biodegradable polymers used in medical devices are cleared or approved for use in the United States of America. Despite the limitations in the design, production, and marketing of these devices, this small number of biodegradable polymers has dominated the resorbable medical device market for the past 50 years. This perspective will review the history and applications of biodegradable polymers used in medical devices, highlight the need and requirements for regenerative biomaterials, and discuss the path behind the recent successful introduction of citrate&#8208;based biomaterials for manufacturing innovative medical products aimed at improving the outcome of musculoskeletal surgeries.

         <title>Deep Learning for Size&#8208;Agnostic Inverse Design of Random&#8208;Network 3D Printed Mechanical Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical metamaterials are architected engineered materials whose unprecedented properties originate from their designs at the microscale. Here, deep&#8208;learning techniques are utilized to develop a modular approach titled &#8220;Deep&#8208;DRAM&#8221; that generates numerous microstructures for mechanical metamaterials with predefined elastic properties and dimensions for various applications in high&#8208;tech industries, such as soft robotics and biomedical engineering.








Abstract
Practical applications of mechanical metamaterials often involve solving inverse problems aimed at finding microarchitectures that give rise to certain properties. The limited resolution of additive manufacturing techniques often requires solving such inverse problems for specific specimen sizes. Moreover, the candidate microarchitectures should be resistant to fatigue and fracture. Such a multi&#8208;objective inverse design problem is formidably difficult to solve but its solution is the key to real&#8208;world applications of mechanical metamaterials. Here, a modular approach titled &#8220;Deep&#8208;DRAM&#8221; that combines four decoupled models is proposed, including two deep learning (DL) models, a deep generative model based on conditional variational autoencoders, and direct finite element (FE) simulations. Deep&#8208;DRAM integrates these models into a framework capable of finding many solutions to the posed multi&#8208;objective inverse design problem based on random&#8208;network unit cells. Using an extensive set of simulations as well as experiments performed on 3D printed specimens, it is demonstrate that: 1) the predictions of the DL models are in agreement with FE simulations and experimental observations, 2) an enlarged envelope of achievable elastic properties (e.g., rare combinations of double auxeticity and high stiffness) is realized using the proposed approach, and 3) Deep&#8208;DRAM can provide many solutions to the considered multi&#8208;objective inverse design problem.

         <title>A Nanozyme&#8208;Based Electrode for High&#8208;Performance Neural Recording</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neural electrodes are indispensable diagnostic and therapeutic tools for neurological disorders. However, their detection sensitivity and biocompatibility remain unsolved challenges. Here, nanozyme electrodes that can simultaneously overcome the limitations associated with recording sensitivity, long&#8208;term acquisition stability, and peripheral nerve tissue necrosis through interfacial quantum transport and inhibition of neuroinflammation are developed, which are promising for brain science and engineering.








Abstract
Implanted neural electrodes have been widely used to treat brain diseases that require high sensitivity and biocompatibility at the tissue&#8211;electrode interface. However, currently used clinical electrodes cannot meet both these requirements simultaneously, which hinders the effective recording of electronic signals. Herein, nanozyme&#8208;based neural electrodes incorporating bioinspired atomically precise clusters are developed as a general strategy with a heterogeneous design for multiscale and ultrasensitive neural recording via quantum transport and biocatalytic processes. Owing to the dual high&#8208;speed electronic and ionic currents at the electrode&#8211;tissue interface, the impedance of nanozyme electrodes is 26 times lower than that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art metal electrodes, and the acquisition sensitivity for the local field potential is &#8776;10 times higher than that of clinical PtIr electrodes, enabling a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) of up to 14.7&#160;dB for single&#8208;neuron recordings in rats. The electrodes provide more than 100&#8208;fold higher antioxidant and multi&#8208;enzyme&#8208;like activities, which effectively decrease 67% of the neuronal injury area by inhibiting glial proliferation and allowing sensitive and stable neural recording. Moreover, nanozyme electrodes can considerably improve the SNR of seizures in acute epileptic rats and are expected to achieve precise localization of seizure foci in clinical settings.

         <title>Unmasking Chemokine&#8208;Inducing Specificity in Oligosaccharide Biomaterial to Promote Hair Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oligosaccharide biomaterial (OG6), discovered through enzymatic degradation of a glucomannan polysaccharide, stimulates specific expression of chemokine CCL5 in primary macrophages, without inducing pro&#8208;/anti&#8208;inflammatory polarization that is often excessively triggered by polysaccharides. Tests in a Foxp3&#8208;reporter mouse model and depilated mouse skin reveal its activity in promoting de novo hair regeneration involving regulatory T cells.








Abstract
Hair loss affects over 50 million people worldwide with limited therapeutic options. Despite evidence highlighting the vital role of local immune cells in regulating the life cycle of hair follicles (HFs), accurate regulation of immunocytes to directly promote hair growth remains unachieved. Here, inspired by the physiological feedback in the skin immunity to suppress microbe&#8208;triggered inflammation, an oligosaccharide biomaterial with &#8220;unmasked&#8221; specific activity is developed to recruit regulatory T (Treg) cells around HFs, leading to accelerated hair growth in mice. By processing the glucomannan polysaccharide via controllable enzymatic cleavage, a series of oligosaccharide fractions with more specific chemokine&#8208;inducing functions is obtained. Notably, a hexasaccharide&#8208;based fraction (OG6) stimulates macrophages to selectively express Treg&#8208;chemoattractant C&#8208;C Motif Chemokine Ligand 5 (CCL5) through a mannose receptor&#8208;mediated endocytosis and NOD1/2&#8208;dependent signaling, as evidenced by molecular docking, inhibition assays, and a Foxp3&#8208;reporter mouse model. Intradermal delivery of OG6 to the depilated mouse skin promotes Treg mobilization around HFs and stimulates de novo regeneration of robust hairs. This study demonstrates that unmasking precise immunomodulatory functions in oligosaccharides from their parental polysaccharide can potentially solve the long&#8208;lasting dilemma with polysaccharide biomaterials that are widely renowned for versatile activities yet high heterogeneity, opening new avenues to designing glycan&#8208;based therapeutic tools with improved specificity and safety.

         <title>Tumor Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Nanoparticles Amplifying STING Signaling Pathway for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor microenvironment&#8208;responsive nanoparticles are constructed to achieve spatiotemporal orchestration of innate immune stimulation by harnessing STING and TLR4 pathways. MPLA&#8208;mediated activation of nuclear factor kappa B amplifies STING signaling to promote the secretion of IFN&#8208;&#946; and other inflammatory cytokines, relieving the immunosuppression of tumor microenvironment and thus effectively inhibiting primary tumor growth as well as tumor recurrence and metastasis.








Abstract
Insufficient activation of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling pathway and profoundly immunosuppressive microenvironment largely limits the effect of cancer immunotherapy. Herein, tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive nanoparticles (PMM NPs) are exploited that simultaneously harness STING and Toll&#8208;like receptor 4 (TLR4) to augment STING activation via TLR4&#8208;mediated nuclear factor&#8208;kappa B signaling pathway stimulation, leading to the increased secretion of type I interferons (i.e., 4.0&#8208;fold enhancement of IFN&#8208;&#946;) and pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines to promote a specific T cell immune response. Moreover, PMM NPs relieve the immunosuppression of the TME by decreasing the percentage of regulatory T cells, and polarizing M2 macrophages to the M1 type, thus creating an immune&#8208;supportive TME to unleash a cascade adaptive immune response. Combined with an anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody, synergistic efficacy is achieved in both inflamed colorectal cancer and noninflamed metastatic breast tumor models. Moreover, rechallenging tumor&#8208;free animals with homotypic cells induced complete tumor rejection, indicating the generation of systemic antitumor memory.

     alt="Tumor Microenvironment-Responsive Nanoparticles Amplifying STING Signaling Pathway for Cancer Immunotherapy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tumor microenvironment-responsive nanoparticles are constructed to achieve spatiotemporal orchestration of innate immune stimulation by harnessing STING and TLR4 pathways. MPLA-mediated activation of nuclear factor kappa B amplifies STING signaling to promote the secretion of IFN-&#946; and other inflammatory cytokines, relieving the immunosuppression of tumor microenvironment and thus effectively inhibiting primary tumor growth as well as tumor recurrence and metastasis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insufficient activation of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling pathway and profoundly immunosuppressive microenvironment largely limits the effect of cancer immunotherapy. Herein, tumor microenvironment (TME)-responsive nanoparticles (PMM NPs) are exploited that simultaneously harness STING and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to augment STING activation via TLR4-mediated nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathway stimulation, leading to the increased secretion of type I interferons (i.e., 4.0-fold enhancement of IFN-&#946;) and pro-inflammatory cytokines to promote a specific T cell immune response. Moreover, PMM NPs relieve the immunosuppression of the TME by decreasing the percentage of regulatory T cells, and polarizing M2 macrophages to the M1 type, thus creating an immune-supportive TME to unleash a cascade adaptive immune response. Combined with an anti-PD-1 antibody, synergistic efficacy is achieved in both inflamed colorectal cancer and noninflamed metastatic breast tumor models. Moreover, rechallenging tumor-free animals with homotypic cells induced complete tumor rejection, indicating the generation of systemic antitumor memory. These TME-responsive nanoparticles may open a new avenue to achieve the spatiotemporal orchestration of STING activation, providing a promising clinical candidate for next-generation cancer immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Defect&#8208;Engineering&#8208;Mediated Long&#8208;Lived Charge&#8208;Transfer Excited&#8208;State in Fe&#8211;Gallate Complex Improves Iron Cycle and Enables Sustainable Fenton&#8208;Like Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
The coupling of a long&#8208;lived ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge&#8208;transfer excited&#8208;state and single electron transfer promotes the Fe cycle in the Fenton&#8208;like process and achieves efficient and sustainable Fenton chemistry. The system achieves comprehensive improvements in reaction kinetics, catalyst&#8208;specific activity, &#8226;OH productivity, and catalytic sustainability.








Abstract
Fenton reactions are inefficient because the Fe(II) catalyst cannot be recycled in time due to the lack of a rapid electron transport pathway. This results in huge H2O2 wastage in industrial applications. Here, it is shown that a sustainable heterogeneous Fenton system is attainable by enhancing the ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge&#8208;transfer (LMCT) excited&#8208;state lifetime in Fe&#8211;gallate complex. By engineering oxygen defects in the complex, the lifetime is improved from 10&#8211;90 ps. The lengthened lifetime ensures sufficient concentrations of excited&#8208;states for an efficient Fe cycle, realizing previously unattainable H2O2 activation kinetics and hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) productivity. Spectroscopic and electrochemical studies show the cyclic reaction mechanism involves in situ Fe(II) regeneration and synchronous supply of oxygen atoms from water to recover dissociated Fe&#9472;O bonds. Trace amounts of this catalyst effectively destroy two drug&#8208;resistant bacteria even after eight reaction cycles. This work reveals the link among LMCT excited&#8208;state lifetime, Fe cycle, and catalytic activity and stability, with implications for de novo design of efficient and sustainable Fenton&#8208;like processes.

         <title>Control of Mechanical and Fracture Properties in Two&#8208;Phase Materials Reinforced by Continuous, Irregular Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By controlling the local architecture of irregular materials, the mechanisms that cause their fracture and design materials that dissipate up to 120% more energy can be influenced. By carefully designing multi&#8208;architecture assemblies, composed of soft and stiff domains, the trajectories of growing cracks, and control their deflection and nucleation can be influenced.








Abstract
Composites with high strength and high fracture resistance are desirable for structural and protective applications. Most composites, however, suffer from poor damage tolerance and are prone to unpredictable fractures. Understanding the behavior of materials with an irregular reinforcement phase offers fundamental guidelines for tailoring their performance. Here, the fracture nucleation and propagation in two phase composites, as a function of the topology of their irregular microstructures is studied. A stochastic algorithm is used to design the polymeric reinforcing network, achieving independent control of topology and geometry of the microstructure. By tuning the local connectivity of isodense tiles and their assembly into larger structures, the mechanical and fracture properties of the architected composites are tailored&#160;at the local and global scale. Finally, combining different reinforcing networks into a spatially determined meso&#8208;scale assembly, it is demonstrated how the spatial propagation of fracture in architected composite materials can be designed and controlled a priori.

         <title>Fully Conjugated 2D sp2 Carbon&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, a fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated sp2 carbon&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF) is successfully developed for photocatalytic overall water splitting. The cyanovinylene linkage is essential in modulating the electronic structure and promoting charge separation, thereby enabling overall water splitting. The crystallinity of COFs is further shown to substantially impact their photocatalytic performances.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) hold great promise for solar&#8208;driven hydrogen production. However, metal&#8208;free COFs for photocatalytic overall water splitting remain elusive, primarily due to challenges in simultaneously regulating their band structures and catalytic sites to enable concurrent half&#8208;reactions. Herein, two types of &#960;&#8208;conjugated COFs containing the same donor&#8211;acceptor structure are constructed via Knoevenagel condensation and Schiff base reaction to afford cyanovinylene&#8208; and imine&#8208;bridged COFs, respectively. The difference in the linkage leads to a remarkable difference in their photocatalytic activity toward water splitting. The 2D sp2 carbon&#8208;linked COF exhibits notable activity for photocatalytic overall water splitting, which can reach an apparent quantum efficiency of 2.53% at 420&#160;nm. In contrast, the 2D imine&#8208;linked COF cannot catalyze the overall water&#8208;splitting reaction. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the cyanovinylene linkage is essential in modulating the band structure and promoting charge separation in COFs, thereby enabling overall water splitting. Moreover, it is further shown that crystallinity substantially impacts the photocatalytic performance of COFs. This study represents the first successful example of developing metal&#8208;free COFs with high crystallinity for photocatalytic overall water splitting.

         <title>Bacteria&#8208;Based Backpacks to Enhance Adoptive Macrophage Transfer against Solid Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of attaching bacteria to macrophages (M&#248;@bac) is reported by means of encapsulating bacterial surface with an adhesive nanocoating. M&#248;@bac can sustainably stimulate the polarization of macrophages toward antitumor phenotypes in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. In the 4T1 murine models, M&#248;@bac can remodel the immune microenvironment, induce a robust immune response, and thus enable a potent therapeutic efficacy.








Abstract
Adoptive cell therapy has emerged as a promising approach for cancer treatment. However, the transfer of macrophages exhibits limited efficacy against solid tumors due to the dynamic cellular phenotypic shift from antitumor to protumor states within the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. In this study, a strategy of attaching bacteria to macrophages (M&#248;@bac) is reported that endows adoptively infused macrophages with durable stimulation by leveraging the intrinsic immunogenicity of bacteria. These attached bacteria, referred to as backpacks, are encapsulated with adhesive nanocoatings and can sustainably control the cellular phenotypes in vivo. Moreover, M&#248;@bac can repolarize endogenous tumor&#8208;associated macrophages, leading to a more robust immune response and thus reducing the tumor progression in a murine 4T1 cancer model without any side effects. This study utilizing bacteria as cellular backpacks opens a new avenue for the development of cell therapies.

This study demonstrates the first case of applying hexaazanonaphthalene (HATNH)&#8208;based 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic framework (Cu&#8208;HATNH) integrated with carbon nanotubes via an in situ polymerization strategy to achieve stable long cycle stability and excellent rate performance with conjugated HATNH and unsaturated [CuO4] units as multiple redox active sites.








Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are gradually gaining attention owing to their natural abundance, excellent security, and high energy density. However, developing excellent organic cathode materials for PIBs to overcome the poor cycling stability and slow kinetics caused by the large radii of K+ ions is challenging. This study demonstrates for the first time the application of a hexaazanonaphthalene (HATN)&#8208;based 2D &#960;&#8208;d conjugated metal&#8211;organic framework (2D c&#8208;MOF) with dual&#8208;active centers (Cu&#8208;HATNH) and integrates Cu&#8208;HATNH with carbon nanotubes (Cu&#8208;HATNH@CNT) as the cathode material for PIBs. Owing to this systematic module integration and more exposed active sites with high utilization, Cu&#8208;HATNH@CNT exhibits a high initial capacity (317.5&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1), excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability (capacity retention of 96.8% at 5 A g&#8722;1 after 2200 cycles), and outstanding rate capacity (147.1&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 10 A g&#8722;1). The reaction mechanism and performance are determined by combining experimental characterization and density functional theory calculations. This contribution provides new opportunities for designing high&#8208;performance 2D c&#8208;MOF cathodes with multiple active sites for PIBs.

         <title>Reducing Gases Triggered Cathode Surface Reconstruction for Stable Cathode&#8211;Electrolyte Interface in Practical All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work highlights the significant influence of surface chemistry of oxide cathode on interfacial compatibility in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). The interface between cathode and solid&#8208;state electrolyte is primarily responsible for the prevailing capacity fading and impedance buildup. Therefore, a surface reconstruction strategy based on a gas&#8211;solid interface reduction reaction is introduced as a promising avenue for designing enhanced ASSLBs.








Abstract
The interfacial compatibility between cathodes and sulfide solid&#8208;electrolytes (SEs) is a critical limiting factor of electrochemical performance in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries (ASSLBs). This work presents a gas&#8211;solid interface reduction reaction (GSIRR), aiming to mitigate the reactivity of surface oxygen by inducing a surface reconstruction layer (SRL) . The application of a SRL, CoO/Li2CO3, onto LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode results in impressive outcomes, including high capacity (149.7 mAh g&#8722;1), remarkable cyclability (retention of 84.63% over 400 cycles at 0.2 C), outstanding rate capability (86.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at 2 C), and exceptional stability in high&#8208;loading cathode (28.97 and 23.45&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) within ASSLBs. Furthermore, the SRL CoO/Li2CO3 enhances the interfacial stability between LCO and Li10GeP2S12 as well as Li3PS4 SEs. Significantly, the experiments suggest that the GSIRR mechanism can be broadly applied, not only to LCO cathodes but also to LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathodes and other reducing gases such as H2S and CO, indicating its practical universality. This study highlights the significant influence of the surface chemistry of the oxide cathode on interfacial compatibility, and introduces a surface reconstruction strategy based on the GSIRR process as a promising avenue for designing enhanced ASSLBs.

         <title>Reconfigurable Cascaded Thermal Neuristors for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting a scalable and energy&#8208;efficient thermal neural network, a novel class of spiking oscillators termed &#8220;thermal neuristors&#8221; is engineered based on the insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal transition (IMT) in vanadium dioxide. Solely through thermal interactions, a wide variety of reconfigurable functionalities mirroring biological neurons are demonstrated, including cascaded information flow, as well as excitatory and inhibitory interactions, without relying on traditional CMOS&#8208;based circuits.








Abstract
While the complementary metal&#8208;oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology is the mainstream for the hardware implementation of neural networks, an alternative route is explored based on a new class of spiking oscillators called &#8220;thermal neuristors&#8221;, which operate and interact solely via thermal processes. Utilizing the insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal transition (IMT) in vanadium dioxide, a wide variety of reconfigurable electrical dynamics mirroring biological neurons is demonstrated. Notably, inhibitory functionality is achieved just in a single oxide device, and cascaded information flow is realized exclusively through thermal interactions. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the neuristors, a detailed theoretical model is developed, which accurately reflects the experimental results. This study establishes the foundation for scalable and energy&#8208;efficient thermal neural networks, fostering progress in brain&#8208;inspired computing.

         <title>High Thermoelectric Performance in Phonon&#8208;Glass Electron&#8208;Crystal Like AgSbTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different length scales of the mean free path of charge carriers and phonons direct twofold enhancement in hole mobility with simultaneous realization of glass&#8208;like thermal conductivity, leading to an ultra&#8208;high thermoelectric performance in Yb&#8208;doped AgSbTe2.








Abstract
Achieving glass&#8208;like ultra&#8208;low thermal conductivity in crystalline solids with high electrical conductivity, a crucial requirement for high&#8208;performance thermoelectrics , continues to be a formidable challenge. A careful balance between electrical and thermal transport is essential for optimizing the thermoelectric performance. Despite this inherent trade&#8208;off, the experimental realization of an ideal thermoelectric material with a phonon&#8208;glass electron&#8208;crystal (PGEC) nature has rarely been achieved. Here, PGEC&#8208;like AgSbTe2 is demonstrated by tuning the atomic disorder upon Yb doping, which results in an outstanding thermoelectric performance with figure of merit, zT &#8776; 2.4 at 573 K. Yb&#8208;doping&#8208;induced enhanced atomic ordering decreases the overlap between the hole and phonon mean free paths and consequently leads to a PGEC&#8208;like transport behavior in AgSbTe2. A twofold increase in electrical mobility is observed while keeping the position of the Fermi level (EF) nearly unchanged and corroborates the enhanced crystalline nature of the AgSbTe2 lattice upon Yb doping for electrical transport. The cation&#8208;ordered domains, lead to the formation of nanoscale superstructures (&#8776;2 to 4&#160;nm) that strongly scatter heat&#8208;carrying phonons, resulting in a temperature&#8208;independent glass&#8208;like thermal conductivity. The strategy paves the way for realizing high thermoelectric performance in various disordered crystals by making them amorphous to phonons while favoring crystal&#8208;like electrical transport.

         <title>Hydronium Intercalation Enables High Rate in Hexagonal Molybdate Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new mechanism of hydronium (H+(H2O)n) intercalation is demonstrated in a new host of hexagonal molybdates by experiments. Thanks to hydronium intercalation, fast&#8208;rate and long lifespan are achieved in electrodes of monocrystals with sizes even over 200&#160;&#181;m.








Abstract
Rapid proton transport in solid&#8208;hosts promotes a new chemistry in achieving high&#8208;rate Faradaic electrodes. Exploring the possibility of hydronium intercalation is essential for advancing proton&#8208;based charge storage. Nevertheless, this is yet to be revealed.

Hexagonal molybdates show a battery&#8208;type initial reduction followed by intercalation pseudocapacitance. Fast rate of 200 C (40 A g&#8722;1) and long lifespan of 30&#160;000 cycles are achieved in electrodes of monocrystals even over 200&#160;&#181;m. Solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance confirms hydronium intercalations, and operando measurements using electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance and synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction disclose distinct intercalation behaviours in different electrolyte concentrations.

Abstract
Developing inorganic&#8211;organic composite polymers necessitates a new strategy for effectively controlling shape and optical properties while accommodating guest materials, as conventional polymers primarily act as &#160;carriers that transport&#160;inorganic substances. Here, a universal approach is introduced utilizing mesoporous liquid crystal polymer particles (MLPs) to fabricate inorganic&#8211;organic composites. By leveraging the liquid crystal phase, morphology and optical properties are precisely controlled through the molecular&#8208;level arrangement of the host, here monomers. The controlled host material allows the synthesis of inorganic particles within the matrix or accommodation of presynthesized nano&#8208;inorganic particles, all while preserving the intrinsic properties of the host material. This composite material surpasses the functional capabilities of the polymer alone by sequentially integrating one or more inorganic materials, allowing for the incorporation of multiple functionalities within a single polymer particle. Furthermore, this approach effectively mitigates the drawbacks associated with guest materials resulting in a substantial enhancement of composite performance. The presented approach is anticipated to hold immense potential for various applications in optoelectronics, catalysis, and biosensing, addressing the evolving demands of the society.

         <title>Bulk Electrosynthesis of Patchy Particles with Highly Controlled Asymmetric Features</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bipolar electrochemistry is used as a versatile tool to modify the surface of particles with various metal patches, located at predefined positions. The complexity of the modification can be fine&#8208;tuned, leading for the extreme case of multi&#8208;Janus particles to chiral features.








Abstract
Asymmetric modification of particles with various patches of different composition and size at predefined positions is an important challenge in contemporary surface chemistry, as such particles have numerous potential applications, ranging from materials science and (photo)catalysis to self&#8208;assembly and drug delivery. However, approaches allowing the synthesis of this kind of complex objects in the bulk of a solution in a straightforward way are currently lacking. In this context, bipolar electrochemistry (BE) is a powerful technique for the asymmetric modification of conducting objects. Herein, this approach is used for the highly controlled modification of particles with different metal patches, generated at specific locations of isotropic objects. The synthesis is carried out in the bulk of the solution and leads to predefined patterns of increasing complexity, including even a specific chiral arrangement of the patches.

         <title>Dispersion Engineering by Hybridizing the Back&#8208;Folded Soft Mode of Monomode Elastic Metamaterials with Stiff Acoustic Modes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strong coupling between ordinary phonon modes and a back&#8208;folded soft phonon mode of a monomode metamaterial is suggested as a means to engineer the metamaterial dispersion relation of the lowest bands. The back&#8208;folding is accomplished by a superlattice or a set of separated beams. Unusual roton&#8208;like phonon bands serve as an example. Calculations and experiments are in excellent agreement. 








Abstract
In many cases, the hybridization of two or more excitation modes in solids has led to new and useful dispersion relations of waves. Well&#8208;studied examples are phonon polaritons, plasmon polaritons, particle&#8208;plasmon polaritons, cavity polaritons, and magnetic resonances at optical frequencies. In all of these cases, the lowest propagating mode couples to a finite&#8208;frequency localized resonance. Herein, the unusual metamaterial phonon dispersion relations arising from the hybridization of an ordinary acoustical phonon mode with a back&#8208;folded soft or easy phonon mode of a monomode elastic metamaterial are discussed. Conceptually, the single easy mode can have strictly zero wave velocity. In reality, its wave velocity is very much smaller than that of all other modes. Considering polymeric three&#8208;dimensional printed elastic monomode metamaterials at ultrasound frequencies, it is shown theoretically and experimentally that the resulting pronounced avoided crossing, with a frequency splitting comparable to the mid&#8208;frequency, leads to backward&#8208;wave behavior for the lowest band over a broad frequency range, conceptually at zero loss.

         <title>Antibacterial and Angiogenic (2A) Bio&#8208;Heterojunctions Facilitate Infectious Ischemic Wound Regeneration via an Endogenous&#8211;Exogenous Bistimulatory Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antibacterial and angiogenic (2A) bio&#8208;heterojunctions (bio&#8208;HJs) consisting of CuS/MXene and a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)&#8208;mimicking peptide (VMP) are devised for infectious wound regeneration via an endogenous&#8211;exogenous bistimulatory angiogenic strategy. Copper ions elevate VEGF secretion, which provokes VEGF receptors activation by endogenous pathway, whereas VMP promotes the exogenous pathway directly.








Abstract
In infectious ischemic wounds, a lack of blood perfusion significantly worsens microbe&#8208;associated infection symptoms and frequently complicates healing. To overcome this daunting issue, antibacterial and angiogenic (2A) bio&#8208;heterojunctions (bio&#8208;HJs) consisting of CuS/MXene heterojunctions and a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)&#8208;mimicking peptide (VMP) are devised and developed to accelerate infectious cutaneous regeneration by boosting angiogenesis via an endogenous&#8211;exogenous bistimulatory (EEB) strategy. Assisted by near&#8208;infrared irradiation, the bio&#8208;HJ platform exhibits versatile synergistic photothermal, photodynamic, and chemodynamic effects for robust antibacterial efficacy. In addition, copper ions liberated from 2A bio&#8208;HJs elevate VEGF secretion from fibroblasts, which provokes VEGF receptors (VEGFR) activation through an endogenous pathway, whereas VMP itself promotes an exogenous pathway to facilitate endothelial cell multiplication and tube formation by directly activating the VEGFR signaling pathway. Moreover, employing an in vivo model of infectious ischemic wounds, it is confirmed that the EEB strategy can considerably boost cutaneous regeneration through pathogen elimination, angiogenesis promotion, and collagen deposition. As envisaged, this work leads to the development of a powerful 2A bio&#8208;HJ platform that can serve as an effective remedy for bacterial invasion&#8208;induced ischemic wounds through the EEB strategy.

         <title>A Multifunctional Scaffold for Bone Infection Treatment by Delivery of microRNA Therapeutics Combined With Antimicrobial Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a novel multifunctional collagen&#8208;based scaffold for treating bone infections. The work demonstrates, for the first time, the feasibility of integrating antimicrobial, antibiotic&#8208;free nanoparticles and microRNA&#8208;based gene therapy for musculoskeletal applications. This multifaceted solution offers significant potential in modern orthopaedics, paving the way for applications beyond bone repair.








Abstract
Treating bone infections and ensuring bone repair is one of the greatest global challenges of modern orthopedics, made complex by antimicrobial resistance (AMR) risks due to long&#8208;term antibiotic treatment and debilitating large bone defects following infected tissue removal. An ideal multi&#8208;faceted solution would will eradicate bacterial infection without long&#8208;term antibiotic use, simultaneously stimulating osteogenesis and angiogenesis. Here, a multifunctional collagen&#8208;based scaffold that addresses these needs by leveraging the potential of antibiotic&#8208;free antimicrobial nanoparticles (copper&#8208;doped bioactive glass, CuBG) to combat infection without contributing to AMR in conjunction with microRNA&#8208;based gene therapy (utilizing an inhibitor of microRNA&#8208;138) to stimulate both osteogenesis and angiogenesis, is developed. CuBG scaffolds reduce the attachment of gram&#8208;positive bacteria by over 80%, showcasing antimicrobial functionality. The antagomiR&#8208;138 nanoparticles induce osteogenesis of human mesenchymal stem cells in vitro and heal a large load&#8208;bearing defect in a rat femur when delivered on the scaffold. Combining both promising technologies results in a multifunctional antagomiR&#8208;138&#8208;activated CuBG scaffold inducing hMSC&#8208;mediated osteogenesis and stimulating vasculogenesis in an in vivo chick chorioallantoic membrane model. Overall, this multifunctional scaffold catalyzes killing mechanisms in bacteria while inducing bone repair through osteogenic and angiogenic coupling, making this platform a promising multi&#8208;functional strategy for treating and repairing complex bone infections.

         <title>Engineering Antimicrobial Metal&#8211;Phenolic Network Nanoparticles with High Biocompatibility for Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antimicrobial, highly biocompatible metal&#8208;phenolic network nanoparticles (am&#8208;MPN NPs) are engineered and applied across different models (cells, blood, zebrafish, and mice). The NPs perform efficiently against multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria owing to their antimicrobial properties, which are related to 1) cell wall damage, 2) reactive oxygen species (ROS), and 3) quinoprotein production. Moreover, they inhibit and eradicate bacterial biofilms and promote the healing of bacterial&#8208;infected skin wounds.








Abstract
Antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria pose a global health threat by causing persistent and recurrent microbial infections. To address this issue, antimicrobial nanoparticles (NPs) with low drug resistance but potent bactericidal effects have been developed. However, many of the developed NPs display poor biosafety and their synthesis often involves complex procedures and the antimicrobial modes of action are unclear. Herein, a simple strategy is reported for designing antimicrobial metal&#8210;phenolic network (am&#8208;MPN) NPs through the one&#8208;step assembly of a seeding agent (diethyldithiocarbamate), natural polyphenols, and metal ions (e.g., Cu2+) in aqueous solution. The Cu2+&#8208;based am&#8208;MPN NPs display lower Cu2+ antimicrobial concentrations (by 10&#8211;1000 times) lower than most reported nanomaterials and negligible toxicity across various models, including, cells, blood, zebrafish, and mice. Multiple antimicrobial modes of the NPs have been identified, including bacterial wall disruption, reactive oxygen species production, and quinoprotein formation, with the latter being a distinct pathway identified for the antimicrobial activity of the polyphenol&#8208;based am&#8208;MPN NPs. The NPs exhibit excellent performance against multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria (e.g., methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)), efficiently inhibit and destroy bacterial biofilms, and promote the healing of MRSA&#8208;infected skin wounds. This study provides insights on the antimicrobial properties of metal&#8210;phenolic materials and the rational design of antimicrobial metal&#8210;organic materials.

         <title>Tailored Succinic Acid&#8208;Derived Molecular Structures toward 25.41%&#8208;Efficiency and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Succinic acid derivative with multiple active sites and optimal spatial positions maximizes the defect binding energy, improves the film quality, and depresses the non&#8208;radiative recombination of the perovskite, giving a record efficiency of 25.41% for RbCsFAMA&#8208;based quadruple&#8208;cation perovskite devices.








Abstract
Minimizing interfacial charged traps in perovskite films is crucial for reducing the non&#8208;radiative recombination and improving device performance. In this study, succinic acid (SA) derivatives varying active sites and spatial configurations are designed to modulate defects and crystallization in perovskite film. The SA derivative with two symmetric Br atoms, dibromosuccinic acid (DBSA), exhibits the optimal spatial arrangement for defect passivation. Experimental and theoretical results indicate that the carboxyl group and atomic Br in DBSA synergistically interact with the under&#8208;coordinated Pb2+. Moreover, the strong electronegativity of Br efficiently stabilizes the formamidinium cation via electrostatic interaction. Consequently, film quality is significantly improved and non&#8208;radiative recombination is markedly depressed, resulting in a photoluminesence lifetime of exceeding 4&#160;&#181;s of and a carrier diffusion length of 3&#160;&#181;m. An exceptional efficiency of 25.41% (certified at 25.00%) along with a high fill factor of 84.39% and excellent long&#8208;term operational stability have been achieved finally.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Stabilized Fiber Sensor for Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Amniotic Fluid During Pregnancy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interface&#8208;stabilized electrochemical fiber sensor is designed for real&#8208;time monitoring of biochemical dynamics in amniotic fluid during pregnancy. The sensor seamlessly integrates into the amnion through tissue adhesion, amniotic regeneration, and uniform stress distribution. The sensor demonstrates response performance with fluctuation of less than 0.3% under complex dynamic conditions and accuracy of more than 98% in pregnant rats.








Abstract
Diseases in pregnancy endanger millions of fetuses worldwide every year. The onset of these diseases can be early warned by the dynamic abnormalities of biochemicals in amniotic fluid, thus requiring real&#8208;time monitoring. However, when continuously penetrated by detection devices, the amnion is prone to loss of robustness and rupture, which is difficult to regenerate. Here, an interface&#8208;stabilized fiber sensor is presented for real&#8208;time monitoring of biochemical dynamics in amniotic fluid during pregnancy. The sensor is seamlessly integrated into the amnion through tissue adhesion, amniotic regeneration, and uniform stress distribution, posing no risk to the amniotic fluid environment. The sensor demonstrates a response performance of less than 0.3% fluctuation under complex dynamic conditions and an accuracy of more than 98% from the second to the third trimester. By applying it to early warning of diseases such as intrauterine hypoxia, intrauterine infection, and fetal growth restriction, fetal survival increases to 95% with timely intervention.

         <title>A Tailored Interface Design for Anode&#8208;Free Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interfacial engineering strategy that contains a lithiated graphite ion&#8208;conducting layer to homogenize the lithium flux, a ductile lithiated polyacrylic acid polymer layer to ensure the stability of the interface, and an silver&#8208;modified copper foil to regulate lithium deposition is designed for anode&#8208;free solid&#8208;state batteries. The collaborative interfacial design enables stable interface and low interface resistance.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free solid&#8208;state batteries (AFSSBs) are considered to be one of the most promising high&#8208;safety and high&#8208;energy storage systems. However, low Coulombic efficiency stemming from severe deterioration on solid electrolyte/current collector (Cu foil) interface and undesirable Li dendrite growth impede their practical application, especially when rigid garnet electrolyte is used. Here, an interfacial engineering strategy between garnet electrolyte and Cu foil is introduced for stable and highly efficient AFSSBs. By utilizing the high Li ion conductivity of LiC6 layer, interfacial self&#8208;adaption ability arising from ductile lithiated polyacrylic acid polymer layer and regulated Li deposition via Li&#8208;Ag alloying reaction, the garnet&#8208;based AFSSB delivers a stable long&#8208;term operation. Additionally, when combined with a commercial LiCoO2 cathode (3.1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2), the cell also exhibits an outstanding capacity retention due to the tailored interface design. The strategies for novel AFSSBs architecture thus offer an alternative route to design next&#8208;generation batteries with high safety and high density.

     alt="A Tailored Interface Design for Anode-Free Solid-State Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interfacial engineering strategy that contains a lithiated graphite ion-conducting layer to homogenize the lithium flux, a ductile lithiated polyacrylic acid polymer layer to ensure the stability of the interface, and an silver-modified copper foil to regulate lithium deposition is designed for anode-free solid-state batteries. The collaborative interfacial design enables stable interface and low interface resistance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anode-free solid-state batteries (AFSSBs) are considered to be one of the most promising high-safety and high-energy storage systems. However, low Coulombic efficiency stemming from severe deterioration on solid electrolyte/current collector (Cu foil) interface and undesirable Li dendrite growth impede their practical application, especially when rigid garnet electrolyte is used. Here, an interfacial engineering strategy between garnet electrolyte and Cu foil is introduced for stable and highly efficient AFSSBs. By utilizing the high Li ion conductivity of LiC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; layer, interfacial self-adaption ability arising from ductile lithiated polyacrylic acid polymer layer and regulated Li deposition via Li-Ag alloying reaction, the garnet-based AFSSB delivers a stable long-term operation. Additionally, when combined with a commercial LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode (3.1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), the cell also exhibits an outstanding capacity retention due to the tailored interface design. The strategies for novel AFSSBs architecture thus offer an alternative route to design next-generation batteries with high safety and high density.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Minimizing Interfacial Recombination in 1.8&#160;eV&#160;Triple&#8208;Halide Perovskites for 27.5% Efficient All&#8208;Perovskite Tandems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>

W e present a new 1.80&#160;eV wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite treated with piperazinium iodide (PI) for all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. This treatment eliminates non&#8208;radiative recombination losses and reduces defect density resulting in an open circuit voltage of 1.36&#160;V and enhanced photostability. Combined with a narrow bandgap (NBG) perovskite, this enables a tandem cell with a certified scan efficiency of 27.5%.








Abstract
All&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells show great potential to enable the highest performance at reasonable costs for a viable market entry in the near future. In particular, wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskites with higher open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) are essential to further improve the tandem solar cells&#8217; performance. Here, a new 1.8&#160;eV bandgap triple&#8208;halide perovskite composition in conjunction with a piperazinium iodide (PI) surface treatment is developed. With structural analysis, it is found that the PI modifies the surface through a reduction of excess lead iodide in the perovskite and additionally penetrates the bulk. Constant light&#8208;induced magneto&#8208;transport measurements are applied to separately resolve charge carrier properties of electrons and holes. These measurements reveal a reduced deep trap state density, and improved steady&#8208;state carrier lifetime (factor 2.6) and diffusion lengths (factor 1.6). As a result, WBG PSCs achieve 1.36&#160;V VOC, reaching 90% of the radiative limit. Combined with a 1.26&#160;eV narrow bandgap (NBG) perovskite with a rubidium iodide additive, this enables a tandem cell with a certified scan efficiency of 27.5%.

         <title>An &#8220;AND&#8221; Logic&#8208;Gated Prodrug Micelle Locally Stimulates Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a novel AND logic&#8208;controlled release prodrug micelle that integrates both external and internal stimuli is developed for codelivering chemotherapeutic agents, camptothecin (CPT), and stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonists DMXAA, enabling precise combinatorial therapy. DMXAA is successfully encapsulated into prodrug micelles through &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and hydrophobic interactions, allowing for tumor&#8208;targeted delivery and significantly enhanced immune activation and antitumor efficacy.








Abstract
Materials that can respond to multiple biomarkers simultaneously, acting as an &#8220;AND&#8221; gate, have the potential to enhance tumor&#8208;targeting for drug delivery. In this study, an &#8220;AND&#8221; logic&#8208;controlled release prodrug micelle is developed for codelivering the chemotherapeutic and the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist, enabling precise combinatorial therapy. The drug release is programmed by tumor&#8208;enriched boramino acids (BAA) in the tumor microenvironment and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in enhanced tumor targeting. STING agonist is successfully encapsulated into prodrug micelles through &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and hydrophobic interactions. These AND logic&#8208;gated prodrug micelles can achieve tumor&#8208;targeted delivery of STING agonist, leading to significantly enhanced immune activation and antitumor efficacy in vivo. It is expected that this clinically relevant nanoplatform will provide a rational design of an effective immunotherapy combination regimen to convert immunologically &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors to immunogenic &#8220;hot&#8221; tumors, addressing the major challenges faced by immunotherapies.

         <title>In Situ Dual&#8208;Interface Passivation Strategy Enables The Efficiency of Formamidinium Perovskite Solar Cells Over 25%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the preparation of formamidinium perovskite solar cells, use of the 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium methanesulfonate (MS) precursor additive results in the spontaneous aggregation of MS molecules at both sides of the interface following perovskite crystallization. This process significantly mitigates the defect density at the interface and curbs the VOC loss. The optimal device prepared using the MS strategy attains a noteworthy power conversion efficiency of 25.12%.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation photovoltaics owing to their unparalleled power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Currently, approaches to further improve device efficiencies tend to focus on the passivation of interfacial defects. Although various strategies have been developed to mitigate these defects, many involve complex and time&#8208;consuming post&#8208;treatment processes, thereby hindering their widespread adoption in commercial applications. In this work, a concise but efficient in situ dual&#8208;interface passivation strategy is developed wherein 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium methanesulfonate (MS) is employed as a precursor additive. During perovskite crystallization, MS can either be enriched downward through precipitation with SnO2, or can be aggregated upward through lattice extrusion. These self&#8208;assembled MS species play a significant role in passivating the defect interfaces, thereby reducing nonradiative recombination losses, and promoting more efficient charge extraction. As a result, a PCE &gt;25% (certified PCE of 24.84%) is achieved with substantially improved long&#8208;term storage and photothermal stabilities. This strategy provides valuable insights into interfacial passivation and holds promise for the industrialization of PSCs.

         <title>Ni Single&#8208;Atoms Based Memristors with Ultrafast Speed and Ultralong Data Retention</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, a novel Ni single&#8208;atoms (NiSAs/N&#8208;C) based non&#8208;volatile memristor to address the contradictory issue of improving both switching speed and retention capability is designed. The device exhibits an ultrafast switching speed of 100 ns and ultralong data retention capability (106 s). After fitting the Arrhenius equation to achieve a data retention lifetime over 10 years.








Abstract
Memristor with low&#8208;power, high density, and scalability fulfills the requirements of the applications of the new computing system beyond Moore's law. However, there are still nonideal device characteristics observed in the memristor to be solved. The important observation is that retention and speed are correlated parameters of memristor with trade off against each other. The delicately modulating distribution and trapping level of defects in electron migration&#8208;based memristor is expected to provide a compromise method to address the contradictory issue of improving both switching speed and retention capability. Here, high&#8208;performance memristor based on the structure of ITO/Ni single&#8208;atoms (NiSAs/N&#8208;C)/Polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP)/Au is reported. By utilizing well&#8208;distributed trapping sites , small tunneling barriers/distance and high charging energy, the memristor with an ultrafast switching speed of 100&#160;ns, ultralong retention capability of 106&#160;s, a low set voltage (Vset) of &#8776;0.7&#160;V, a substantial ON/OFF ration of 103, and low spatial variation in cycle&#8208;to&#8208;cycle (500 cycles) and device&#8208;to&#8208;device characteristics (128 devices) is demonstrated. On the premise of preserving the strengths of a fast switching speed, this memristor exhibits ultralong retention capability comparable to the commercialized flash memory. Finally, a memristor ratioed logic&#8208;based combinational memristor array to realize the one&#8208;bit full adder is further implemented.

By utilizing well-distributed trapping sites , small tunneling barriers/distance and high charging energy, the memristor with an ultrafast switching speed of 100&#160;ns, ultralong retention capability of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;s, a low set voltage (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;set&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) of &#8776;0.7&#160;V, a substantial ON/OFF ration of 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and low spatial variation in cycle-to-cycle (500 cycles) and device-to-device characteristics (128 devices) is demonstrated. On the premise of preserving the strengths of a fast switching speed, this memristor exhibits ultralong retention capability comparable to the commercialized flash memory. Finally, a memristor ratioed logic-based combinational memristor array to realize the one-bit full adder is further implemented.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Eutectic Electrolyte with Weak Hydrogen Bonds for High&#8208;Rate and Ultra&#8208;Stable Ammonium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Hydrogen bonds dominate the solvation interaction of NH4+. Weakening the interactions between NH4+ and solvent molecules can significantly improve the rate capability and long&#8208;term cycling performance of NH4&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
As the need for sustainable battery chemistry grows, non&#8208;metallic ammonium ion (NH4+) batteries are receiving considerable attention because of their unique properties, such as low cost, nontoxicity, and environmental sustainability. In this study, the solvation interactions between NH4+ and solvents are elucidated and design principles for NH4+ weakly solvated electrolytes are proposed. Given that hydrogen bond interactions dominate the solvation of NH4+ and solvents, the strength of the solvent's electrostatic potential directly determines the strength of its solvating power. As a proof of concept, succinonitrile with relatively weak electronegativity is selected to construct a metal&#8208;free eutectic electrolyte (MEE). As expected, this MEE is able to significantly broaden the electrochemical stability window and reduce the solvent binding energy in the solvation shell, which leads to a lower desolvation energy barrier and a fast charge transfer process. As a result, the as&#8208;constructed NH4&#8208;ion batteries exhibit superior reversible rate capability (energy density of 65&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8211;1total active mass at 600&#160;W&#160;kg&#8211;1) and unprecedent long&#8208;term cycling performance (retention of 90.2% after 1000 cycles at 1.0&#160;A&#160;g&#8211;1). The proposed methodology for constructing weakly hydrogen bonded electrolytes will provide guidelines for implementing high&#8208;rate and ultra&#8208;stable NH4+&#8208;based energy storage systems.

         <title>Polyphenol&#8208;Mediated Liquid Metal Composite Architecture for Solar Thermoelectric Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of liquid gallium nanoparticles and a metal&#8208;phenolic ink creates a unique architecture that can act as a highly efficient broad&#8208;spectrum solar light absorber. The resulting composite applied on a thermoelectric device can generate clean energy with a record power density of 870.5&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 under 2&#160;Sun illumination.








Abstract
The development of advanced solar energy technologies, which efficiently convert solar energy to heat and then to electricity, remains a significant challenge in the pursuit of clean energy production. Here, this challenge is addressed by designing a photothermal absorber composed of liquid gallium particles and a natural polyphenol&#8208;based coordination ink. The design of this composite takes advantage of the tuneable light absorption properties of the polyphenol inks and can also be applied onto flexible substrates. While the ink utilizes two types of coordination complexes to absorb light at different wavelengths, the liquid gallium particles with high thermal and electrical properties provide enhanced thermoelectric effect. As such, the photothermal composite exhibits a broad&#8208;spectrum light absorption and highly efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion. A thermoelectric generator coated with the photothermal composite exhibits an impressive voltage output of &#8776;185.3&#160;mV when exposed to 1&#160;Sun illumination, without requiring any optical concentration, which sets a new record for a power density at 345.5&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2. This work showcases the synergistic combination of natural compound&#8208;based light&#8208;absorbing coordination complexes with liquid metals to achieve a strong photothermal effect and their integration into thermoelectric devices with powerful light harvesting capabilities.

         <title>Alkoxythiophene&#8208;Directed Fibrillization of Polymer Donor for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>

Alkoxythiophene additives are developed to induce the fibrillization of a series of BDT&#8208;type polymer donors for organic solar cells, demonstrating generally increased efficiency, with the PM6/L8&#8208;BO binary device reaching 19.2%.








Abstract
Realizing fibrillar molecular framework is highly encouraged in organic solar cells (OSCs) due to the merit of efficient charge carrier transport. This is however mainly achieved via the chemical structural design of photovoltaic semiconductors. In this work, through the utilization of three alkoxythiophene additives, T&#8208;2OMe, T&#8208;OEH, and T&#8208;2OEH, the intermolecular interactions among a series of BDT&#8208;type polymer donors, i.e., PM6, D18, PBDB&#8208;T, and PTB7&#8208;Th, are tuned to self&#8208;assemble into nanofibrils during solution casting. X&#8208;ray technique and molecular dynamics simulation reveal that the alkoxythiophene with (2&#8208;ethylhexyl)oxy (&#9472;OEH) chains can attach on the 2&#8208;ethylhexyl (EH) chains of these polymer donors and promote their self&#8208;assembly into 1D nanofibrils, in their neat films as well as photovoltaic blends with L8&#8208;BO. By adapting these fibrillar polymer donors to construct pseudo&#8208;bulk heterojunction (P&#8208;BHJ) OSCs via layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer deposition, generally improved device performance is seen, with power conversion efficiencies enhanced from 18.2% to 19.2% (certified 18.96%) and from 17.9% to 18.7% for the PM6/L8&#8208;BO and D18/L8&#8208;BO devices, respectively. This work provides a physical approach to promote the fibrillar charge transport channels for efficient photovoltaics.

         <title>Gradient Quasi&#8208;Solid Electrolyte Enables Selective and Fast Ion Transport for Robust Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The gradient polymetric networks (GHNs) are fixed directly on zinc anode via the interface&#8208;initiated epitaxial polymerization strategy. The GHNs not only favor the Zn2+ shuttle but lock the interfacial free water, alleviating the dendrite and corrosion on zinc anode. This work demonstrates the asymmetric design concept in quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes to improve the energy density, power density, and cycling stability of aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs).








Abstract
The quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes (QSEs) attract extensive attention due to their improved ion transport properties and high stability, which is synergistically based on tunable functional groups and confined solvent molecules among the polymetric networks. However, the trade&#8208;off effect between the polymer content and ionic conductivity exists in QSEs, limiting their rate performance. In this work, the epitaxial polymerization strategy is used to build the gradient hydrogel networks (GHNs) covalently fixed on zinc anode. Then, it is revealed that the asymmetric distribution of negative charges benefits GHNs with fast and selective ionic transport properties, realizing a higher Zn2+ transference number of 0.65 than that (0.52) for homogeneous hydrogel networks (HHNs) with the same polymer content. Meanwhile, the high&#8208;density networks formed at Zn/GHNs interface can efficiently immobilize free water molecules and homogenize the Zn2+ flux, greatly inhibiting the water&#8208;involved parasitic reactions and dendrite&#160;growth. Thus, the GHNs enable dendrite&#8208;free stripping/plating over 1000&#160;h at 8&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8722;2 in a Zn||Zn symmetric cell, as well as the evidently prolonged cycles in various full cells. This work will shed light on asymmetric engineering of ion transport channels in advanced quasi&#8208;solid battery systems to achieve high energy and safety.

Thus, the GHNs enable dendrite-free stripping/plating over 1000&#160;h at 8&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 1 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in a Zn||Zn symmetric cell, as well as the evidently prolonged cycles in various full cells. This work will shed light on asymmetric engineering of ion transport channels in advanced quasi-solid battery systems to achieve high energy and safety.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Design of Layered Hybrid Silver Bismuth Bromine Single Crystal for Ultra&#8208;Stable X&#8208;Ray Detection With Record Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work emphasizes the huge impact of interlayer interaction and charge transfer direction on LH&#8208;AgBiBr X&#8208;ray detectors. A high&#8208;stable X&#8208;ray detector with record sensitivity (2638 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) and ultra&#8208;low detection limit (7.4 nGyair s&#8722;1) is achieved through an appropriate divalent amine design. Finally, high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging is realized on linear detector arrays under benign operation conditions.








Abstract
Nowadays, weak interlayer coupling and unclear mechanism in layered hybrid silver bismuth bromine (LH&#8208;AgBiBr) are the main reasons for limiting its further enhanced X&#8208;ray detection sensitivity and stability. Herein, the design rules for LH&#8208;AgBiBr and its influence on X&#8208;ray detection performance are reported for the first time. Although shortening amine size can enhance interlayer coupling, its detection performance is severely hampered by its easier defect formation caused by enlarged micro strain. In contrast, an appropriate divalent amine design endows the material with improved interlayer coupling and released micro strain, which benefits crystal stability and mechanical hardness. Another contribution is to increase material density and dielectric constant; thus, enhancing X&#8208;ray absorption and carrier transport. Consequently, the optimized parallel device based on BDA2AgBiBr8 achieves a record sensitivity of 2638 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and an ultra&#8208;low detection limit of 7.4 nGyair s&#8722;1, outperforming other reported LH&#8208;AgBiBr X&#8208;ray detectors. Moreover, the unencapsulated device displays remarkable anti&#8208;moisture, anti&#8208;thermal (&gt;150 &#176;C), and anti&#8208;radiation (&gt;1000 Gyair) endurance. Eventually, high&#8208;resolution hard X&#8208;ray imaging is demonstrated by linear detector arrays under a benign dose rate (1.63 &#181;Gyair s&#8722;1) and low external bias (5&#160;V). Hence, these findings provide guidelines for future materials design and device optimization.

         <title>Experimental Realization of Monolayer &#945;&#8208;Tellurene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports on a novel bottom&#8211;up approach, using three atom&#8208;long tellurium chains, derived from the dynamic non&#8208;equilibrium growth of an a&#8208;Si:Te alloy, as building blocks for the self&#8208;assembly of monolayer &#945;&#8208;tellurene on a Sb2Te3 substrate. Atomic&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy demonstrates the hexagonal lattice of &#945;&#8208;tellurene.








Abstract
2D materials emerge as a versatile platform for developing next&#8208;generation devices. The experimental realization of novel artificial 2D atomic crystals, which does not have bulk counterparts in nature, is still challenging and always requires new physical or chemical processes. Monolayer &#945;&#8208;tellurene is predicted to be a stable 2D allotrope of tellurium (Te), which has great potential for applications in high&#8208;performance field&#8208;effect transistors. However, the synthesis of monolayer &#945;&#8208;tellurene remains elusive because of its complex lattice configuration, in which the Te atoms are stacked in tri&#8208;layers in an octahedral fashion. Here, a self&#8208;assemble approach, using three atom&#8208;long Te chains derived from the dynamic non&#8208;equilibrium growth of an a&#8208;Si:Te alloy as building blocks, is reported for the epitaxial growth of monolayer &#945;&#8208;tellurene on a Sb2Te3 substrate. By combining scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy with density functional theory calculations, the surface morphology and electronic structure of monolayer &#945;&#8208;tellurene are revealed and the underlying growth mechanism is determined. The successful synthesis of monolayer &#945;&#8208;tellurene opens up the possibility for the application of this new single&#8208;element 2D material in advanced electronic devices.

         <title>A PD&#8208;L1&#8208;targeting Regulator for Metabolic Reprogramming to Enhance Glutamine Inhibition&#8208;Mediated Synergistic Antitumor Metabolic and Immune Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PD&#8208;L1&#8208;targeting metabolism and immune regulator (PMIR) is constructed for metabolic reprogramming. PMIR inhibits glutamine metabolism of tumor cells, while solves compensatory&#160;glycolysis and utilizes upregulated PD&#8208;L1 for self&#8208;amplifying accumulation. Cooperating with the immunogenic cell death through&#160;the disruption of the redox homeostasis, PMIR can evoke robust immune responses to suppress bilateral tumor progression and metastasis.








Abstract
Inhibition of glutamine metabolism in tumor cells can cause metabolic compensation&#8208;mediated glycolysis enhancement and PD&#8208;L1 upregulation&#8208;induced immune evasion, significantly limiting the therapeutic efficacy of glutamine inhibitors. Here, inspired by the specific binding of receptor and ligand, a PD&#8208;L1&#8208;targeting metabolism and immune regulator (PMIR) are constructed by decorating the glutaminase inhibitor (BPTES)&#8208;loading zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) with PD&#8208;L1&#8208;targeting peptides for regulating the metabolism within the tumor microenvironment (TME) to improve immunotherapy. At tumor sites, PMIR inhibits glutamine metabolism of tumor cells for elevating glutamine levels within the TME to improve the function of immune cells. Ingeniously, the accompanying PD&#8208;L1 upregulation on tumor cells causes self&#8208;amplifying accumulation of PMIR through PD&#8208;L1 targeting, while also blocking PD&#8208;L1, which has the effects of converting enemies into friends. Meanwhile, PMIR exactly offsets the compensatory glycolysis, while disrupting the redox homeostasis in tumor cells via the cooperation of components of the ZIF and BPTES. These together cause immunogenic cell death of tumor cells and relieve PD&#8208;L1&#8208;mediated immune evasion, further reshaping the immunosuppressive TME and evoking robust immune responses to effectively suppress bilateral tumor progression and metastasis. This work proposes a rational strategy to surmount the obstacles in glutamine inhibition for boosting existing clinical treatments.

         <title>Epitaxial Growth of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 at a Well&#8208;Matched Heterointerface for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells and Solar Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A released distortion of 2D perovskite ((NAM)2PbI4) with large Pb&#8208;I&#8208;Pb angle is realized via weakening the hydrogen bonding between organic spacer and [PbI6]4&#8722; octahedron. It leads to the formation of well&#8208;matched heterointerface between (002) facet of (NAM)2PbI4 and (100) plane of FAPbI3, which lowers the crystal formation energy and triggers the epitaxial growth &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. An impressive power conversion efficiency of 25.4% (certified 25.2%) is achieved by the target perovskite solar cells, along with enhanced stability.








Abstract
Although the FAPbI3 perovskite system exhibits an impressive optoelectronic characteristic and thermal stability because of its energetically unstable black phase at room temperature, it is considerably challenging to attain a controllable and oriented nucleation of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. To overcome this challenge, a 2D perovskite with a released inorganic octahedral distortion designed by weakening the hydrogen interactions between the organic interlayer and [PbI6]4&#8722; octahedron is presented in this study. A highly matched heterointerface can be formed between the (002) facet of the 2D structure and the (100) crystal plane of the cubic &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, thereby lowering the crystallization energy and inducing a heterogeneous nucleation of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. This &#8220;epitaxial growth&#8221; mechanism results form the highly preferred crystallographic orientation of the (100) facets, improved crystal quality and film uniformity, substantially increased charge transporting characteristics, and suppressed nonradiative recombination losses. An impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.4% (certified 25.2%) is achieved using target PSCs, which demonstrates outstanding ambient and operational stability. The feasibility of this strategy is proved for the scalable deposition of homogeneous and high&#8208;quality perovskite thin films by demonstrating the remarkably increased PCE of the large&#8208;area perovskite solar module, from 18.2% to 20.1%.

It leads to the formation of well-matched heterointerface between (002) facet of (NAM)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and (100) plane of FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which lowers the crystal formation energy and triggers the epitaxial growth &#945;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. An impressive power conversion efficiency of 25.4% (certified 25.2%) is achieved by the target perovskite solar cells, along with enhanced stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite system exhibits an impressive optoelectronic characteristic and thermal stability because of its energetically unstable black phase at room temperature, it is considerably challenging to attain a controllable and oriented nucleation of &#945;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. To overcome this challenge, a 2D perovskite with a released inorganic octahedral distortion designed by weakening the hydrogen interactions between the organic interlayer and [PbI&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; octahedron is presented in this study. A highly matched heterointerface can be formed between the (002) facet of the 2D structure and the (100) crystal plane of the cubic &#945;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, thereby lowering the crystallization energy and inducing a heterogeneous nucleation of &#945;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This &#8220;epitaxial growth&#8221; mechanism results form the highly preferred crystallographic orientation of the (100) facets, improved crystal quality and film uniformity, substantially increased charge transporting characteristics, and suppressed nonradiative recombination losses. An impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.4% (certified 25.2%) is achieved using target PSCs, which demonstrates outstanding ambient and operational stability. The feasibility of this strategy is proved for the scalable deposition of homogeneous and high-quality perovskite thin films by demonstrating the remarkably increased PCE of the large-area perovskite solar module, from 18.2% to 20.1%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selenium&#8208;Anchored Chlorine Redox Chemistry in Aqueous Zinc Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

A selenium&#8208;based organic molecule, diphenyl diselenide, is developed as the chlorine anchoring agent and realizes an atomic level&#8208;chlorine fixation through chalcogen&#8211;halogen coordinating chemistry. Benefiting from the highly reversible Cl0/&#8722; redox reaction with extra low Cl2 emission, the resulted battery delivers remarkable electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Chlorine&#8208;based batteries with Cl0 to Cl&#8722; redox reaction (ClRR) are promising for high&#8208;performance energystorage due to their high redox potential and large theoretical capacity. However, the inherent gas&#8211;liquid conversion feature of ClRR together with poor Cl fixation can cause Cl2 leakage, reducing battery reversibility. Herein, we utilize a Se&#8208;based organic molecule, diphenyl diselenide (di&#8208;Ph&#8208;Se), as the Cl anchoring agent and realize an atomic level&#8208;Cl fixation through chalcogen&#8208;halogencoordinating chemistry. The promoted Cl fixation, with two oxidized Cl0 anchoring on a single Ph&#8208;Se, and the multivalence conversion of Se contributeto a six&#8208;electron conversion process with up to 507&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and an average voltage of 1.51&#160;V, as well as a high energy density of 665&#160;Wh&#160;Kg&#8722;1. Based on the superior reversibility of thedeveloped di&#8208;Ph&#8208;Se electrode with ClRR, a remarkable rate performance (205 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1) and cycling performance (capacity retention of 77.3 % after 500cycles) are achieved. Significantly, the pouch cell delivers a record arealcapacity of up to 6.87&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 and extraordinary self&#8208;discharge performance. This chalcogen&#8208;halogen coordination chemistry between the Se electrode and Cl provides a new insight for developing reversible and efficientbatteries with halogen redox reactions.

         <title>Chemical Zymogens and Transmembrane Activation of Transcription in Synthetic Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
An artificial signaling pathway is engineered herein such that a synthetic cell responds to an external biochemical stimulus by the production of adenosine triphosphate and transcription. The importance of cellularity is highlighted and encapsulation enables production of RNA in biochemical mixtures that otherwise inhibit transcription.








Abstract
In this work, synthetic cells equipped with an artificial signaling pathway that connects an extracellular trigger event to the activation of intracellular transcription are engineered. Learning from nature, this is done via an engineering of responsive enzymes, such that activation of enzymatic activity can be triggered by an external biochemical stimulus. Reversibly deactivated creatine kinase to achieve triggered production of adenosine triphosphate, and a reversibly deactivated nucleic acid polymerase for on&#8208;demand synthesis of RNA are engineered. An extracellular, enzyme&#8208;activated production of a diffusible zymogen activator is also designed. The key achievement of this work is that the importance of cellularity is illustrated whereby the separation of biochemical partners is essential to resolve their incompatibility, to enable transcription within the confines of a synthetic cell. The herein designed biochemical pathway and the engineered synthetic cells are arguably primitive compared to their natural counterpart. Nevertheless, the results present a significant step toward the design of synthetic cells with responsive behavior, en route from abiotic to life&#8208;like cell mimics.

         <title>Manipulating Coherent Exciton Dynamics in CsPbI3 Perovskite Quantum Dots Using Magnetic Field</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fine&#8208;structure&#8208;splitting bright excitons in lead halide perovskite quantum dots represent an emerging platform for quantum information technologies. Herein a magnetic field is applied to modulate the exciton splitting and polarization in CsPbI3 QDs, to &#8220;synthesize&#8221; coherent superpositions of excitons, and to control coherent evolution of such superposition states under near&#8208;ambient temperature.








Abstract
Lead halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have recently emerged as a promising material platform for quantum information processing owing to their strong light&#8211;matter interaction and relatively long&#8208;lived optical and spin coherences. In particular, the coherence of the fine&#8208;structure bright excitons is sustainable up to room temperature and can be observed even at an ensemble level. Here modulation of the polarization of these excitons in CsPbI3 QDs and manipulation of their time&#8208;domain coherent dynamics using a longitudinal magnetic field are demonstrated. The manipulation is realized using femtosecond quantum beat spectroscopy performed with both circularly&#8208; and linearly&#8208;polarized pulses. The results are well captured by the density of matrix simulation and are picturized using a Bloch sphere. This study forms the basis for preparing arbitrary coherent superpositions of excitons in perovskite QDs for an array of quantum technologies under near&#8208;ambient conditions.

         <title>Heterogenized Molecular Electrocatalyst Based on a Hydroxo&#8208;Bridged Binuclear Copper(II) Phenanthroline Compound for Selective Reduction of CO2 to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Numerous studies have shown that copper&#8208;based materials are promising catalysts for electroreductive coupling of CO2. However, a frequent problem is the generation of large amounts of hydrogen as a byproduct. In this context, a binuclear copper phenanthroline complex is presented which, in heterogenized form, generates ethylene and other C2 products in an aqueous electrolyte with minimal H2 formation.








Molecular copper catalysts have emerged as promising candidates for the electrochemical reduction of CO2. Notable features of such systems include the ability of Cu to generate C2+&#160;products and the well&#8208;defined active sites that allow for targeted structural tuning. However, the frequently observed in situ formation of Cu nanoclusters has undermined the advantages of the molecular frameworks. It is therefore desirable to develop Cu&#8208;based catalysts that retain their molecular structures during electrolysis. In this context, a heterogenized binuclear hydroxo&#8208;bridged phenanthroline Cu(II) compound with a short Cu&#183;&#183;&#183;Cu distance is reported as a simple yet efficient catalyst for electrogeneration of ethylene and other C2 products. In an aqueous electrolyte, the catalyst demonstrates remarkable performance, with excellent Faradaic efficiency for C2 products (62%) and minimal H2 evolution (8%). Furthermore, it exhibits high stability, manifested by no observable degradation during 15 h of continuous electrolysis. The preservation of the atomic distribution of the active sites throughout electrolysis is substantiated through comprehensive characterizations, including X&#8208;ray photoelectron and absorption spectroscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, UV&#8211;vis spectroscopy, as well as control experiments. These findings establish a solid foundation for further investigations into targeted structural tuning, opening new avenues for enhancing the catalytic performance of Cu&#8208;based molecular electrocatalysts.

         <title>Evolutionary Reinforcement of Polymer Networks: A Stepwise&#8208;Enhanced Strategy for Ultrarobust Eutectogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stepwise&#8208;enhanced strategy is devised through complementary annealing and solvent exchange processes for the evolutionary reinforcement of gel networks crosslinked by crystalline domains. The resultant ultrarobust eutectogel exhibits record&#8208;breaking strength (31.8 MPa), Young's modulus (25.6 MPa), and toughness (76.0 MJ m&#8208;3), together with exceptional resistance ability to tear and crack propagation.








Abstract
Gel materials are appealing due to their diverse applications in biomedicine, soft electronics, sensors, and actuators. Nevertheless, the existing synthetic gels are often plagued by feeble network structures and inherent defects associated with solvents, which compromise their mechanical load&#8208;bearing capacity and cast persistent doubts about their reliability. Herein, combined with attractive deep eutectic solvent (DES), a stepwise&#8208;enhanced strategy is presented to fabricate ultrarobust eutectogels. It focuses on the continuous modulation and optimization of polymer networks through complementary annealing and solvent exchange processes, which drives a progressive increase in both quantity and mass of the interconnected polymer chains at microscopic scale, hence contributing to the evolutionary enhancement of network structure. The resultant eutectogel exhibits superb mechanical properties, including record&#8208;breaking strength (31.8&#160;MPa), toughness (76.0&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), and Young's modulus (25.6&#160;MPa), together with exceptional resistance ability to tear and crack propagation. Moreover, this eutectogel is able to be further programmed through photolithography to in situ create patterned eutectogel for imparting specific functionalities. Enhanced by its broad applicability to various DES combinations, this stepwise&#8208;enhanced strategy is poised to serve as a crucial template and methodology for the future development of robust gels.

         <title>1D Insertion Chains Induced Small&#8208;Polaron Collapse in MoS2 2D Layers Toward Fast&#8208;Charging Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polaron collapse strategy is proposed by introducing 1D [MoS] chains into 2D MoS2 layers to gain intrinsic fast charge transfer. The as&#8208;obtained thermodynamically stable Mo2S3 exhibits high&#8208;rate capability (up to 60 C) and long&#8208;term cycling stability (over 15&#160;000 cycles) in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The study is expected to supplement a new idea for electrode design toward fast&#8208;charging batteries.








Abstract
Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with high theoretical capacity is viewed as a promising anode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries but suffers from inferior rate capability owing to the polaron&#8208;induced slow charge transfer. Herein, a polaron collapse strategy induced by electron&#8208;rich insertions is proposed to effectively solve the above issue. Specifically, 1D [MoS] chains are inserted into MoS2 to break the symmetry states of 2D layers and induce small&#8208;polaron collapse to gain fast charge transfer so that the as&#8208;obtained thermodynamically stable Mo2S3 shows metallic behavior with 107 times larger electrical conductivity than that of MoS2. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that Mo2S3 owns highly delocalized anions, which substantially reduce the interactions of Na&#8722;S to efficiently accelerate Na+ diffusion, endowing Mo2S3 lower energy barrier (0.38&#160;vs 0.65&#160;eV of MoS2). The novel Mo2S3 anode exhibits a high capacity of 510 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 C and a superior high&#8208;rate stability of 217 mAh g&#8722;1 at 40 C over 15&#160;000 cycles. Further in situ and ex situ characterizations reveal the in&#8208;depth reversible redox chemistry in Mo2S3. The proposed polaron collapse strategy for intrinsically facilitating charge transfer can be conducive to electrode design for fast&#8208;charging batteries.

         <title>Strong p&#8208;d Orbital Hybridization on Bismuth Nanosheets for High Performing CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>

The in situ confinement of metal atoms on bismuth nanosheet enables the d&#8208;p orbital hybridization to enhance electrocatalytic performance for carbon dioxide reduction.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom alloys (SAAs) show great potential for a variety of electrocatalytic reactions. However, the atomic orbital hybridization effect of SAAs on the electrochemical reactions is unclear yet. Herein, the in situ confinement of vanadium/molybdenum/tungsten&#160;atoms on bismuth nanosheet is shown to create SAAs with rich grain boundaries, respectively. With the detailed analysis of microstructure and composition, the strong p&#8208;d orbital hybridization between bismuth and vanadium enables the exceptional electrocatalytic performance for carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction with the Faradaic efficiency nearly 100% for C1 products in a wide potential range from &#8722;0.6 to &#8722;1.4&#160;V, and a long&#8208;term electrolysis stability for 90&#160;h. In&#8208;depth in situ investigations with theoretical computations reveal that the electron delocalization toward vanadium atoms via the p&#8208;d orbital hybridization evokes the bismuth active centers for efficient CO2 activation via the &#963;&#8208;donation of O&#8208;to&#8208;Bi, thus reduces protonation energy barriers for formate production. With such fundamental understanding, SAA electrocatalyst is employed to fabricated the solar&#8208;driven electrolytic cell of CO2 reduction and 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation, achieving an outstanding 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid yield of 90.5%. This study demonstrates a feasible strategy to rationally design advanced SAA electrocatalysts via the basic principles of p&#8208;d orbital hybridization.

         <title>A Machine Learning Study on High Thermal Conductivity Assisted to Discover Chalcogenides with Balanced Infrared Nonlinear Optical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;throughput screening pipeline combining first&#8208;principle calculation and machine learning is proposed, using lattice thermal conductivity predicted by machine learning for the first time as primary screening criteria to discover mid&#8208;IR nonlinear optical (NLO) chalcogenides. Structural chemistry knowledge to balance thermal conducting and NLO&#8208;related properties is extracted during the procedure. For application, two potential mid&#8208;IR NLO materials with promising performances are identified.








Abstract
Exploration of novel nonlinear optical (NLO) chalcogenides with high laser&#8208;induced damage thresholds (LIDT) is critical for mid&#8208;infrared (mid&#8208;IR) solid&#8208;state laser applications. High lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;L) is crucial to increasing LIDT yet often neglected in the search for NLO crystals due to lack of accurate &#954;L data. A machine learning (ML) approach to predict &#954;L for over 6000 chalcogenides is hereby proposed. Combining ML&#8208;generated &#954;L data and first&#8208;principles calculation, a high&#8208;throughput screening route is initiated, and ten new potential mid&#8208;IR NLO chalcogenides with optimal bandgap, NLO coefficients, and thermal conductivity are discovered, in which Li2SiS3 and AlZnGaS4 are highlighted. Big&#8208;data analysis on structural chemistry proves that the chalcogenides having dense and simple lattice structures with low anisotropy, light atoms, and strong covalent bonds are likely to possess higher &#954;L. The four&#8208;coordinated motifs in which central cations show the bond valence sum of +2 to +3 and are from IIIA, IVA, VA, and IIB groups, such as those in diamond&#8208;like defect&#8208;chalcopyrite chalcogenides, are preferred to fulfill the desired structural chemistry conditions for balanced NLO and thermal properties. This work provides not only an efficient strategy but also interpretable research directions in the search for NLO crystals with high thermal conductivity.

         <title>Microfluidic&#8208;Assisted 3D Printing Zinc Powder Anode with 2D Conductive MOF/MXene Heterostructures for High&#8208;Stable Zinc&#8722;Organic Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative microfluidic&#8208;assisted 3D printing strategy is proposed to successfully realize 3D hierarchical porous Zn powder aerogel anode with 2D conductive MOF/MXene heterostructure. More importantly, a zinc&#8208;organic full battery matched with 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl organic cathode riveted on graphene delivers a high reversible discharge capacity and maintains a long cycle life of 1200 cycles with a capacity retention of 96.8%.








Abstract
Zinc powder (Zn&#8208;P) anodes have significant advantages in terms of universality and machinability compared with Zn foil anodes. However, their rough surface, which has a high surface area, intensifies the uncontrollable growth of Zn dendrites and parasitic side reactions. In this study, an anti&#8208;corrosive Zn&#8208;P&#8208;based anode with a functional layer formed from a MXene and Cu&#8208;THBQ (MXene/Cu&#8208;THBQ) heterostructure is successfully fabricated via microfluidic&#8208;assisted 3D printing. The unusual anti&#8208;corrosive and strong adsorption of Zn ions using the MXene/Cu&#8208;THBQ functional layer can effectively homogenize the Zn ion flux and inhibit the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) during the repeated process of Zn plating/stripping, thus achieving stable Zn cycling. Consequently, a symmetric cell based on Zn&#8208;P with the MXene/Cu&#8208;THBQ anode exhibits a highly reversible cycling of 1800&#160;h at 2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2/1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, a Zn&#8208;organic full battery matched with a 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl organic cathode riveted on graphene delivers a high reversible capacity and maintains a long cycle life.

         <title>Precipitated Iodine Cathode Enabled by Trifluoromethanesulfonate Oxidation for Cathode/Electrolyte Mutualistic Aqueous Zn&#8211;I Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a novel cathode/electrolyte mutualistic aqueous (CEMA) Zn&#8211;I battery by leveraging the inherent oxidation ability of trifluoromethanesulfonate in aqueous electrolyte toward triiodide species, which facilitates the creation of iodine sediment nanoparticles, is presented. An iodine host cathode is further realized via an in situ absorption technology. Through precisely tuning the I redox process, the CEMA Zn&#8211;I batteries demonstrate remarkable electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8211;I batteries hold great potential for high&#8208;safety and sustainable energy storage. However, the iodide shuttling effect and the hydrogen evolution reaction that occur in the aqueous electrolyte remain the main obstacles for their further development. Herein, the design of a cathode/electrolyte mutualistic aqueous (CEMA) Zn&#8211;I battery based on the inherent oxidation ability of aqueous trifluoromethanesulfonate ((OTf)&#8722;) electrolyte toward triiodide species is presented. This results in the formation of iodine sediment particles assembled by fine iodine nanocrystals (&#8776;10 nm). An iodine host cathode with high areal iodine loading is realized via a spontaneous absorption process that enriched redox&#8208;active iodine and iodide species from aqueous electrolyte onto nanoporous carbon based current collector. By tuning iodide redox process and suppressing competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, the assembled CEMA Zn&#8211;I batteries demonstrate a remarkable capacity retention of 76.9% over 1000 cycles at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, they exhibit a notable rate capability, with a capacity retention of 74.6% when the current density is increased from 0.5 to 5.0 mA cm&#8722;2. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using the oxidation effect to repel redox&#8208;active species from the electrolyte to the cathode, paving a new avenue for high&#8208;performance aqueous Zn&#8211;I batteries.

         <title>In Situ Surface Reconstruction toward Planar Heterojunction for Efficient and Stable FAPbI3 Quantum Dot Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple post&#8208;treatment using methylamine thiocyanate (MASCN) is developed to reconstruct the formamidinium lead iodide perovskite quantum dot (FAPbI3 QD) film surface. The MASCN post&#8208;treatment not only passivates the surface defects but also achieves in situ construction of planar heterojunctions. The obtained FAPbI3 QD solar cells exhibit a high power conversion efficiency of 16.23%, outperforming other reported FAPbI3 QD cells.








Abstract
Pure&#8208;phase &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 quantum dots (QDs) are the focus of an increasing interest in photovoltaics due to their superior ambient stability, large absorption coefficient, and long charge&#8208;carrier lifetime. However, the trap states induced by the ligand&#8208;exchange process limit the photovoltaic performances. Here, a simple post treatment using methylamine thiocyanate is developed to reconstruct the FAPbI3&#8208;QD film surface, in which a MAPbI3 capping layer with a thickness of 6.2 nm is formed on the film top. This planar perovskite heterojunction leads to a reduced density of trap&#8208;states, a decreased band gap, and a facilitated charge carrier transport. As a result, a record high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.23% with negligible hysteresis is achieved for the FAPbI3 QD solar cell, and it retains over 90% of the initial PCE after being stored in ambient environment for 1000 h.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Graphene Liquid Cell Electron Microscopy for Instability of Intermediate Amyloid Fibrils</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (GLC&#8208;TEM) is a novel single&#8208;molecule technique offering valuable insights into molecular processes. GLC&#8208;TEM provides an extension of the observable limit for biomolecules and demonstrates molecular structural variations. Using GLC&#8208;TEM, stochastic and time&#8208;resolved investigations of single amyloid fibril reveal structural perturbations during the initial fibrillar stage.








Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule techniques are powerful microscopy methods that provide new insights into biological processes. Liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy (LP&#8208;TEM) is an ideal single&#8208;molecule technique for overcoming the poor spatiotemporal resolution of optical approaches. However, single&#8208;molecule LP&#8208;TEM is limited by several challenges such as electron&#8208;beam&#8208;induced molecular damage, difficulty in identifying biomolecular species, and a lack of analytical approaches for conformational dynamics. Herein, a single&#8208;molecule graphene liquid&#8208;cell TEM (GLC&#8208;TEM) technique that enables the investigation of real&#8208;time structural perturbations of intact amyloid fibrils is presented. It is demonstrated that graphene membranes significantly extend the observation period of native amyloid beta proteins without causing oxidative damage owing to electron beams, which is necessary for imaging. Stochastic and time&#8208;resolved investigations of single fibrils reveal that structural perturbations in the early fibrillar stage are responsible for the formation of various amyloid polymorphs. The advantage of observing structural behavior in real time with unprecedented resolution will potentially make GLC&#8208;TEM a complementary approach to other single&#8208;molecule techniques.

All&#8208;organic aerogel fibers stable up to 650&#160;&#176;C derived from Zylon are synthesized by controlled proton absorption gelation spinning and heat&#8208;induced cross&#8208;linking strategy. The aerogel fibers exhibit high flexibility, high mechanical strength (8.6&#160;MPa), good flame retardancy (LOI = 54.2%), and textiles woven from these aerogel fibers exhibit outstanding thermal insulation and sensing properties.








Abstract
The exceptional lightweight, highly porous, and insulating properties of aerogel fibers make them ideal for thermal insulation. However, current aerogel fibers face limitations due to their low resistance to harsh environments and a lack of intelligent responses. Herein, a universal strategy for creating polymer aerogel fibers using crosslinked nanofiber building blocks is proposed. This approach combines controlled proton absorption gelation spinning with a heat&#8208;induced crosslinking process. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, Zylon aerogel fibers that exhibited robust thermal stability (up to 650&#160;&#176;C), high flame retardancy (limiting oxygen index of 54.2%), and extreme chemical resistance are designed and synthesized. These fibers possess high porosity (98.6%), high breaking strength (8.6&#160;MPa), and low thermal conductivity (0.036 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1). These aerogel fibers can be knotted or woven into textiles, utilized in harsh environments (&#8722;196&#8211;400&#160;&#176;C), and demonstrate sensitive self&#8208;powered sensing capabilities. This method of developing aerogel fibers expands the applications of high&#8208;performance polymer fibers and holds great potential for future applications in wearable smart protective fabrics.

         <title>An Ultrahigh Power Density and Ultralow Wear GaN&#8208;Based Tribovoltaic Nanogenerator for Sliding Ball Bearing as Self&#8208;Powered Wireless Sensor Node</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A GaN&#8208;based ball&#8208;on&#8208;disk structure tribovoltaic nanogenerator is invented, which exhibits an open&#8208;circuit voltage exceeding 130 V and an ultrahigh normalized average power density of 24.6 kW m&#8208;2 Hz&#8208;1 (282&#8208;fold improvement compared to previous works). It also achieves frictional energy harvesting for industrial bearings, demonstrating great potential for intelligent components and self&#8208;powered sensor nodes in the industrial Internet of Things.








Abstract
The tribovoltaic effect is regarded as a newly discovered semiconductor effect for mechanical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical energy conversion. However, tribovoltaic nanogenerators (TVNGs) are widely limited by low output power and poor wear resistance for device integration and application. Here, this work invents a TVNG using a ball&#8208;on&#8208;disk structure composed of gallium nitride (GaN) and steel ball. It exhibits an open&#8208;circuit voltage exceeding 130&#160;V and an ultrahigh normalized average power density of 24.6&#160;kW m&#8722;2 Hz&#8722;1, which is a 282&#8208;fold improvement compared to previous works. Meanwhile, this TVNG reaches an ultralow wear rate of 5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;7 mm3 N&#8722;1 m&#8722;1 at a maximum contact pressure of 906.6&#160;MPa, surpassing the TVNG composed of Si by three orders of magnitude due to the local concentrated injection of frictional energy. Based on the TVNG, this work constructs the first tribovoltaic bearing and achieves sensing signal transmission within 16 s (300 rpm) by integrating a management circuit, a transmission module, a relay, and receiving terminals, which enables the monitoring of ambient pressure and temperature. This work realizes a GaN&#8208;based TVNG with high&#8208;performance and low wear simultaneously, demonstrating great potential for intelligent components and self&#8208;powered sensor nodes in the industrial Internet of Things.

         <title>Highly Crystalized MAPbX3 Perovskite Triangular Nanowire Arrays for Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single crystalline MAPbX3 triangular nanowire (TNW) arrays are prepared using a simple and effective method. The poly(dimethylsiloxane) TNW arrays serve as templates to induce the growth of perovskite molecules with adjustable size and periodicity via space&#8208;confined effect. Finally, the large&#8208;scale MAPbI3 TNW&#8208;based photodetector arrays present potentials for scaling&#8208;up applications as high&#8208;resolution image sensors.








Abstract
Here, a facile fabrication approach for the high&#8208;quality 1D perovskite triangular nanowire (TNW) array synthesis through space&#8208;confined effect is reported. A soft stamp containing 1D triangular linear array pattern is used to confine the MAPbX3 solution and to guide the growth of the nanowires along the prescribed direction with good crystallinity. The further constructed photodetectors based on the obtained MAPbI3 TNWs exhibit superior photoresponse properties with a responsivity of (125.2 &#177; 2.5) A W&#8722;1 and detectivity of (2.8 &#177; 0.8) &#215; 1013 Jones at the wavelength of 650 nm. This excellent performance is attributed to the highly crystalline TNW with optical anisotropy and a small asymptotic height, which reduces the probability of the photon reflection and promotes the carrier transport. More interestingly, the increased surface area of the triangular device can present superior flexibility after a couple of thousands of bending cycles. Furthermore, by fabricating 7 &#215; 7 photodetector arrays, the potential image sensor application is demonstrated. The perovskite nanowire fabrication approach is scalable and compatible with current semiconductor manufacturing, which indicates their great potential in broad applications.

         <title>Revealing the Mutually Enhanced Mechanism of Necroptosis and Immunotherapy Induced by Defect Engineering and Piezoelectric Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin CaBi2Nb2O9 nanosheets with oxygen vacancies show a high piezocatalytic effect. Reactive oxygen species and overloaded Ca2+ upregulate the expression of RIPK3 and MIKL proteins, inducing the onset of necroptosis. Necroptosis induces a robust immune response by inducing DC maturation and macrophage M1 polarization. The secreted cytokine TNF&#8208;&#945; again enhances necroptosis. A mutual enhancement is thereby achieved.








Abstract
Owing to low immunogenicity&#8208;induced immune escape and short&#8208;term circulating immune responses, the efficiency of immunotherapy is unsatisfactory. Therefore, triggering immunogenic cell death and establishing a long&#8208;term, mutually reinforced treatment modality are urgent challenges. In this study, ultrathin CaBi2Nb2O9 nanosheets with tunable oxygen vacancies (abbreviated as CBNO&#8208;OV1) are prepared for synergistic necroptosis and immunotherapy. The optimized vacancy concentration significantly improves the piezoelectric effect under ultrasound irradiation, thereby considerably improving the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Density functional theory shows that oxygen vacancies can improve the efficiency of electron hole separation by suppressing their recombination, thus resulting in enhanced piezocatalytic activity. Moreover, the piezoelectric effect improves the permeability of tumor cell membranes, thus resulting in Ca2+ influx. Additionally, CBNO&#8208;OV1 also releases a portion of Ca2+, which induces necroptosis assisted by explosive ROS. Ribonucleic acid transcription tests suggest the mechanisms associated with immune response activation and necroptosis. More importantly, necroptosis can trigger a significant immune response in vivo, thus activating macrophage M1 polarization through the NF&#8208;kappa B pathway and promoting T&#8208;cell differentiation.Tumor Necrosis Factor&#8208;&#945; differentiated from macrophages conversely promotes necroptosis, thus realizing a mutually enhanced effect. This study demonstrates the feasibility of mutually reinforced necroptosis and immunotherapy for amplifying tumor efficacy.

         <title>Decoupling Activation and Transport by Electron&#8208;Regulated Atomic&#8208;Bi Harnessed Surface&#8208;to&#8208;Pore Interface for Vanadium Redox Flow Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron&#8208;regulated atomic&#8208;Bi harnessed surface&#8208;to&#8208;pore interfaces are successfully designed and prepared for enhancing the power density and round&#8208;trip efficiency of vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) through decoupling activation and mass transport. VRFB energy storage systems with such a catalytic interface efficiently enable the conversion and transmission of energy from renewable sources.








Abstract
Vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) promises a route to low&#8208;cost and grid&#8208;scale electricity storage using renewable energy resources.

&lt;p&gt;Electron-regulated atomic-Bi harnessed surface-to-pore interfaces are successfully designed and prepared for enhancing the power density and round-trip efficiency of vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) through decoupling activation and mass transport. VRFB energy storage systems with such a catalytic interface efficiently enable the conversion and transmission of energy from renewable sources.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) promises a route to low-cost and grid-scale electricity storage using renewable energy resources. However, the interplay of mass transport and activation processes of high-loading catalysts makes it challenging to drive high-performance density VRFB. Herein, a surface-to-pore interface design that unlocks the potential of atomic-Bi-exposed catalytic surface via decoupling activation and transport is reported. The functional interface accommodates electron-regulated atomic-Bi catalyst in an asymmetric Bi&#9472;O&#9472;Mn structure that expedites the V&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;/V&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; conversion, and a mesoporous Mn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sub-scaffold for rapid shuttling of redox-active species, whereby the site accessibility is maximized, contrary to conventional transport-limited catalysts. By in situ grafting this interface onto micron-porous carbon felt (Bi&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-sMn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-CF), a high-performance flow battery is achieved, yielding a record high energy efficiency of 76.72% even at a high current density of 400&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a peak power density of 1.503&#160;W cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, outdoing the battery with sMn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-CF (62.60%, 0.978&#160;W cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) without Bi catalyst.

         <title>Ultrahigh Capacity from Complexation&#8208;Enabled Aluminum&#8208;Ion Batteries with C70 as the Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel complexation mechanism is reported for energy storage in RABs by utilizing 0D fullerene C70 as the cathode. This mechanism enables remarkable discharge voltage (&#8776;1.65&#160;V) and especially a record&#8208;high reversible specific capacity (750&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 200&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1) of RABs. This work provides a new route to realize high&#8208;capacity and long&#8208;life batteries following the complexation mechanism.








Abstract
Restricted by the available energy storage modes, currently rechargeable aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (RABs) can only provide a very limited experimental capacity, regardless of the very high gravimetric capacity of Al (2980&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1). Here, a novel complexation mechanism is reported for energy storage in RABs by utilizing 0D fullerene C70 as the cathode. This mechanism enables remarkable discharge voltage (&#8776;1.65&#160;V) and especially a record&#8208;high reversible specific capacity (750&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 200&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1) of RABs. By means of in situ Raman monitoring, mass spectrometry, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is found that this elevated capacity is attributed to the direct complexation of one C70 molecule with 23.5 (super)halogen moieties (superhalogen AlCl4 and/or halogen Cl) in average, forming (super)halogenated C70&#183;(AlCl4)mCln&#8208;m complexes. Upon discharging, decomplexation of C70&#183;(AlCl4)mCln&#8208;m releases AlCl4&#8722;/Cl&#8722; ions while preserving the intact fullerene cage. This work provides a new route to realize high&#8208;capacity and long&#8208;life batteries following the complexation mechanism.

         <title>Polarization&#8208; and Gate&#8208;Tunable Optoelectronic Reverse in 2D Semimetal/Semiconductor Photovoltaic Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D semimetal/semiconductor photovoltaic heterostructures are developed to achieve a high polarization ratio (PR) value and unique optoelectronic reverse with bidirectional rectifying and photoresponse. Furthermore, the device exhibits a polarization induced reverse in photocurrent, resulting in a possibility of PR value reaching infinity, paving the way for integration of the multiple functional modules into a single module toward &#8220;All&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; system.








Abstract
Polarimetric photodetector can acquire higher resolution and more surface information of imaging targets in complex environments due to the identification of light polarization. To date, the existing technologies yet sustain the poor polarization sensitivity (&lt;10), far from market application requirement. Here, the photovoltaic detectors with polarization&#8208; and gate&#8208;tunable optoelectronic reverse phenomenon are developed based on semimetal 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoTe2 and ambipolar WSe2. The device exhibits gate&#8208;tunable reverse in rectifying and photovoltaic characters due to the directional inversion of energy band, yielding a wide range of current rectification ratio from 10&#8722;2 to 103 and a clear object imaging with 100 &#215; 100 pixels. Acting as a polarimetric photodetector, the polarization ratio (PR) value can reach a steady state value of &#8776;30, which is compelling among the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 2D&#8208;based polarized detectors. The sign reversal of polarization&#8208;sensitive photocurrent by varying the light polarization angles is also observed, that can enable the PR value with a potential to cover possible numbers (1&#8594;+&#8734;/&#8208;&#8734;&#8594;&#8722;1). This work develops a photovoltaic detector with polarization&#8208; and gate&#8208;tunable optoelectronic reverse phenomenon, making a significant progress in polarimetric imaging and multifunction integration applications.

         <title>Rapid Surface Reconstruction in Air&#8208;Processed Perovskite Solar Cells by Blade Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
N,N&#8208;diphenylguanidine monohydrobromide (DPGABr) dissolved in acetonitrile is blade&#8208;coated on the perovskite layer in air to reconstruct the perovskite surface by forming amorphous DPGABr&#8211;PbI2 complex in hundreds of milliseconds. The resultant devices show a relative enhancement of 15% in the average power conversion efficiency (PCE). More importantly, the device performance undergoes negligible degradation even after 1&#8208;year storage in air.








Abstract
Blade coating has been developed to be an essential technique for large&#8208;area fabrication of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, effective surface treatment of the perovskite layer, which is a critical step for improving PSC performance, remains challenges during blade coating due to the short interaction time between the modification solution and the perovskite layer, as well as the limited selection of available organic solvents. In this study, a novel modifier N,N&#8208;diphenylguanidine monohydrobromide (DPGABr) dissolved in acetonitrile (ACN) is blade coated on the MA0.7FA0.3PbI3 surface in air to reconstruct the perovskite surface in hundreds of milliseconds. This work finds that the solvent ACN rapidly dissolves organic iodide of the perovskite layer and leads to a PbI2&#8208;rich surface, providing reactive sites for DPGABr to form a thin DPGABr/PbI2 complex layer. This surface reconstruction can effectively passivate defects and induce n&#8208;type doping on the perovskite surface to facilitate electron transfer. The resultant devices show a 15% improvement in average power conversion efficiency. More importantly, the devices with the surface reconstruction show outstanding long&#8208;term stability, with negligible performance degradation even after 1&#8208;year storage in air. This study presents a convenient and effective approach for improving the performance of blade&#8208;coated PSCs prepared in air.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Separated Lipid&#8208;Based Nanoparticles: Selective Behavior at the Nano&#8208;Bio Interface</title>

The synthetic diacylglycerol analogue lipid DOaG induces phase separation in lipid&#8208;based nanoparticles, generating distinct lipid droplets. In liposomes, DOaG&#8208;induced lipid packing defects&#160;facilitate recognition and recruitment of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), with subsequent selective hydrolysis of the DOaG&#8208;rich lipid droplet. In mRNA&#8208;LNPs DOaG induces phase separation, leading to selective cell targeting, mRNA delivery, and concomitant protein expression in vivo.








Abstract
The membrane&#8208;protein interface on lipid&#8208;based nanoparticles influences their in vivo behavior. Better understanding may evolve current drug delivery methods toward effective targeted nanomedicine. Previously, the cell&#8208;selective accumulation of a liposome formulation in vivo is demonstrated, through the recognition of lipid phase&#8208;separation by triglyceride lipases. This exemplified how liposome morphology and composition can determine nanoparticle&#8208;protein interactions. Here, the lipase&#8208;induced compositional and morphological changes of phase&#8208;separated liposomes&#8212;which bear a lipid droplet in their bilayer&#8212; are investigated, and the mechanism upon which&#160;lipases recognize and bind to the particles is unravelled. The selective lipolytic degradation of the phase&#8208;separated lipid droplet is observed, while nanoparticle integrity remains intact. Next, the Tryptophan&#8208;rich loop of the lipase is identified as the region with which the enzymes bind to the particles. This preferential binding is due to lipid packing defects induced on the liposome surface by phase separation. In parallel, the existing knowledge that phase separation leads to in vivo selectivity, is utilized to generate phase&#8208;separated mRNA&#8208;LNPs that target cell&#8208;subsets in zebrafish embryos, with subsequent mRNA delivery and protein expression. Together, these findings can expand the current knowledge on selective nanoparticle&#8208;protein communications and in vivo behavior, aspects that will assist to gain control of lipid&#8208;based nanoparticles.

Oligosaccharide Biomaterials
In article number 2304655, Jian Xiao, Lei Dong, Chunming Wang, and co&#8208;workers report the first&#8208;ever oligosaccharide called OG6 (it is a string of six sugar rings in the structure) that can promote hair growth. The authors discovered it by &#8216;unmasking&#8217; its hidden activity from a longer molecule. Therefore, in this image, they illustrate OG6 as a winning &#8216;lottery&#8217; comprising six sugar balls. When the curtain ascends (&#8216;unmasking&#8217;) , the OG6 balls roll out and light up the golden coins below. These coins represent hair follicles &#8208; shining, floating, and entering the hair growth phase (&#8216;anagen&#8217;), as a consequence of OG6's magic power!

Polarimetric Photodetectors
Due to the directional inversion of energy band, the photovoltaic detectors based on 2D anisotropic semimetal and ambipolar semiconductor exhibit an optoelectronic reverse phenomenon. In this image, the transport direction of photocurrent is readily reversed by tuning the gate voltage and incident light polarization, yielding a reversible rectifying and photovoltaic characteristic as well as exceptional polarimetric photodetection performance. More details can be found in article number 2309371 by Zhongming Wei, Jingbo Li, Nengjie Huo, and co&#8208;workers.

Monolayer&#945;&#8208;Tellurene
Monolayer &#945;&#8208;tellurene, which has a 1T&#8208;MoS2&#8208;like lattice structure, has been predicted to be a novel two&#8208;dimensional semiconductor. The article number 2309023 by Xiaochun Huang, Baisheng Sa, Roland Wiesendanger, and co&#8208;workers reports on a novel bottom&#8208;up approach, using three atom&#8208;long Te chains, derived from the dynamic non&#8208;equilibrium growth of an &#945; &#8208;Si:Te alloy, as building blocks for the self&#8208;assembly of monolayer &#945;&#8208;tellurene on a Sb2Te3 substrate.

         <title>Hierarchies in Visual Pathway: Functions and Inspired Artificial Vision</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological vision is an exciting source of inspiration for the development of artificial vision systems. Using neuromorphic devices to simulate the functions of different parts in the biological vision pathway is beneficial to realize ultra&#8208;low power consumption and high&#8208;speed machine vision. Meanwhile, the development of photoelectric materials and the novelty of device structure accelerate the realization of this goal.








Abstract
The development of artificial intelligence has posed a challenge to machine vision based on conventional complementary metal&#8208;oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits owing to its high latency and inefficient power consumption originating from the data shuffling between memory and computation units. Gaining more insights into the function of every part of the visual pathway for visual perception can bring the capabilities of machine vision in terms of robustness and generality. Hardware acceleration of more energy&#8208;efficient and biorealistic artificial vision highly necessitates neuromorphic devices and circuits that are able to mimic the function of each part of the visual pathway. In this paper, we&#160;review the structure and function of the entire class of visual neurons from the retina to the primate visual cortex within reach (Chapter 2) are reviewed. Based on the extraction of biological principles, the recent hardware&#8208;implemented visual neurons located in different parts of the visual pathway are discussed in detail in Chapters 3 and 4. Furthermore, valuable applications of inspired artificial vision in different scenarios (Chapter 5) are provided. The functional description of the visual pathway and its inspired neuromorphic devices/circuits are expected to provide valuable insights for the design of next&#8208;generation artificial visual perception systems.

         <title>Oral Nanomedicine: Challenges and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses the impact of biological barriers (the gastric acid and intestinal mucosal barrier) on the bioavailability of oral medicine in the delivery process. Notably, nanotechnology sheds light on oral medical therapy in diverse diseases by endowing organic and inorganic nanomaterials with more possibility to enhance oral bioavailability.








Abstract
Compared to injection administration, oral administration is free of discomfort, wound infection, and complications and has a higher compliance rate for patients with diverse diseases. However, oral administration reduces the bioavailability of medicines, especially biologics (e.g., peptides, proteins, and antibodies), due to harsh gastrointestinal biological barriers. In this context, the development and prosperity of nanotechnology have helped improve the bioactivity and oral availability of oral medicines. On this basis, first, the biological barriers to oral administration are discussed, and then oral nanomedicine based on organic and inorganic nanomaterials and their biomedical applications in diverse diseases are reviewed. Finally, the challenges and potential opportunities in the future development of oral nanomedicine, which may provide a vital reference for the eventual clinical transformation and standardized production of oral nanomedicine, are put forward.

Abstract
Combining materials science, artificial intelligence (AI), physical chemistry, and other disciplines, materials informatics is continuously accelerating the vigorous development of new materials. The emergence of &#8220;GPT (Generative Pre&#8208;trained Transformer) AI&#8221; shows that the scientific research field has entered the era of intelligent civilization with &#8220;data&#8221; as the basic factor and &#8220;algorithm + computing power&#8221; as the core productivity. The continuous innovation of AI will impact the cognitive laws and scientific methods, and reconstruct the knowledge and wisdom system. This leads to think more about materials informatics. Here, a comprehensive discussion of AI models and materials infrastructures is provided, and the advances in the discovery and design of new materials are reviewed. With the rise of new research paradigms triggered by &#8220;AI for Science&#8221;, the vane of materials informatics: &#8220;MatGPT&#8221;, is proposed and the technical path planning from the aspects of data, descriptors, generative models, pretraining models, directed design models, collaborative training, experimental robots, as well as the efforts and preparations needed to develop a new generation of materials informatics, is carried out. Finally, the challenges and constraints faced by materials informatics are discussed, in order to achieve a more digital, intelligent, and automated construction of materials informatics with the joint efforts of more interdisciplinary scientists.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microfluidic platforms based on fluorescence, electrochemistry, mass spectrometry, colorimetry are used for the real&#8208;time in situ monitoring of biomarkers for cellular processes of cell, virus, and bacteria. This review will draw a picture of this research area, highlight the advantages and disadvantages of existing methodologies for real&#8208;time in situ monitoring of biomarkers in cellular processes, and provide a prospective investigation of cellular processes.








Abstract
Cellular processes are mechanisms carried out at the cellular level that are aimed at guaranteeing the stability of the organism they comprise. The investigation of cellular processes is key to understanding cell fate, understanding pathogenic mechanisms, and developing new therapeutic technologies. Microfluidic platforms are thought to be the most powerful tools among all methodologies for investigating cellular processes because they can integrate almost all types of the existing intracellular and extracellular biomarker&#8208;sensing methods and observation approaches for cell behavior, combined with precisely controlled cell culture, manipulation, stimulation, and analysis. Most importantly, microfluidic platforms can realize real&#8208;time in situ detection of secreted proteins, exosomes, and other biomarkers produced during cell physiological processes, thereby providing the possibility to draw the whole picture for a cellular process. Owing to their advantages of high throughput, low sample consumption, and precise cell control, microfluidic platforms with real&#8208;time in situ monitoring characteristics are widely being used in cell analysis, disease diagnosis, pharmaceutical research, and biological production. This review focuses on the basic concepts, recent progress, and application prospects of microfluidic platforms for real&#8208;time in situ monitoring of biomarkers in cellular processes.

         <title>Structural Understanding for High&#8208;Voltage Stabilization of Lithium Cobalt Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural instability is the major factor limiting access to higher capacity and energy density of the monopoly LiCoO2 cathode in consumer electronics. This necessitates in&#8208;depth and thorough knowledge of the LiCoO2 structure. The present review focuses on the fundamental structural understanding of LiCoO2 and aims to establish a deeper structure&#8211;performance relationship to better guide future structural stabilization.








Abstract
The rapid development of modern consumer electronics is placing higher demands on the lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2; LCO) cathode that powers them. Increasing operating voltage is exclusively effective in boosting LCO capacity and energy density but is inhibited by the innate high&#8208;voltage instability of the LCO structure that serves as the foundation and determinant of its electrochemical behavior in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. This has stimulated extensive research on LCO structural stabilization. Here, it is focused on the fundamental structural understanding of LCO cathode from long&#8208;term studies. Multi&#8208;scale structures concerning LCO bulk and surface and various structural issues along with their origins and corresponding stabilization strategies with specific mechanisms are uncovered and elucidated at length, which will certainly deepen and advance the knowledge of LCO structure and further its inherent relationship with electrochemical performance. Based on these understandings, remaining questions and opportunities for future stabilization of the LCO structure are also emphasized.

         <title>Triboelectric Nanogenerators Based on Fluid Medium: From Fundamental Mechanisms toward Multifunctional Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluid&#8208;based triboelectric nanogenerators (FB&#8208;TENGs) are emerging energy technologies with improved effective contact area and prolonged triboelectric effect compared to their solid&#8208;based counterparts. This review summarizes the working mechanism and optimization strategies of various FB&#8208;TENGs, including liquid&#8208;solid, gas&#8208;solid, liquid&#8208;liquid, and gas&#8208;liquid TENGs. Their respective advantages, applications, and challenges have been also systematically discussed, offering guidance for designing high&#8208;performance FB&#8208;TENGs.








Abstract
Fluid&#8208;based triboelectric nanogenerators (FB&#8208;TENGs) are at the forefront of promising energy technologies, demonstrating the ability to generate electricity through the dynamic interaction between two dissimilar materials, wherein at least one is a fluidic medium (such as gas or liquid). By capitalizing on the dynamic and continuous properties of fluids and their interface interactions, FB&#8208;TENGs exhibit a larger effective contact area and a longer&#8208;lasting triboelectric effect in comparison to their solid&#8208;based counterparts, thereby affording longer&#8208;term energy harvesting and higher&#8208;precision self&#8208;powered sensors in harsh conditions. In this review, various fluid&#8208;based mechanical energy harvesters, including liquid&#8208;solid, gas&#8208;solid, liquid&#8208;liquid, and gas&#8208;liquid TENGs, have been systematically summarized. Their working mechanism, optimization strategies, respective advantages and applications, theoretical and simulation analysis, as well as the existing challenges, have also been comprehensively discussed, which provide prospective directions for device design and mechanism understanding of FB&#8208;TENGs.

The utilization of a microstructural&#8208;informed thermodynamic model enables the creation of pseudoelastic Fe&#8211;Mn&#8211;Al&#8211;Ni shape&#8208;memory alloys with enhanced reversibility. The feasibility of the proposed alloy&#8208;design strategy is proven by complementary spherical nanoindentation and in situ compression tests. The innovative computational&#8208;thermodynamics approach allows a direct composition design for improved functional properties, marking a substantial advance in shape&#8208;memory alloy research.








Abstract
A microstructural informed thermodynamic model is utilized to tailor the pseudoelastic performance of a series of Fe&#8211;Mn&#8211;Al&#8211;Ni shape&#8208;memory alloys. Following this approach, the influence of the stability and the amount of the B2&#8208;ordered precipitates on the stability of the austenitic state and the pseudoelastic response is revealed. This is assessed by a combination of complementary nanoindentation measurements and incremental&#8208;strain tests under compressive loading. Based on these investigations, the applicability of the proposed models for the prediction of shape&#8208;memory capabilities of Fe&#8211;Mn&#8211;Al&#8211;Ni alloys is confirmed. Eventually, these thermodynamic considerations enable the guided enhancement of functional properties in this alloy system through the direct design of alloy compositions. The procedure proposed renders a significant advancement in the field of shape&#8208;memory alloys.

         <title>Maximizing Triboelectric Nanogenerators by Physics&#8208;Informed AI Inverse Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing triboelectric nanogenerators with specific output remains a challenge mainly due to the uncertainties associated with their complex designs. This paper provides insights into the current challenges of designing and optimizing triboelectric nanogenerators and presents physics&#8208;informed artificial intelligence inverse design strategies to tackle these challenges. The potential of physics&#8208;informed inverse design to propel triboelectric nanogenerators to intelligent systems is discussed.








Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators offer an environmentally friendly approach to harvesting energy from mechanical excitations. This capability has made them widely sought&#8208;after as an efficient, renewable, and sustainable energy source, with the potential to decrease reliance on traditional fossil fuels. However, developing triboelectric nanogenerators with specific output remains a challenge mainly due to the uncertainties associated with their complex designs for real&#8208;life applications. Artificial intelligence&#8208;enabled inverse design is a powerful tool to realize performance&#8208;oriented triboelectric nanogenerators. This is an emerging scientific direction that can address the concerns about the design and optimization of triboelectric nanogenerators leading to a next generation nanogenerator systems. This perspective paper aims at reviewing the principal analysis of triboelectricity, summarizing the current challenges of designing and optimizing triboelectric nanogenerators, and highlighting the physics&#8208;informed inverse design strategies to develop triboelectric nanogenerators. Strategic inverse design is particularly discussed in the contexts of expanding the four&#8208;mode analytical models by physics&#8208;informed artificial intelligence, discovering new conductive and dielectric materials, and optimizing contact interfaces. Various potential development levels of artificial intelligence&#8208;enhanced triboelectric nanogenerators are delineated. Finally, the potential of physics&#8208;informed artificial intelligence inverse design to propel triboelectric nanogenerators from prototypes to multifunctional intelligent systems for real&#8208;life applications is discussed.

         <title>Engineering Mesoscopic 3D Tumor Models with a Self&#8208;Organizing Vascularized Matrix</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D bioprinting and bioengineering approaches are combined to cultivate 3D vascularized tumors, including patient&#8208;derived ones, at the mesoscopic scale. Functional connections between self&#8208;evolved vascular networks and bioprinted endothelium enable the spontaneous migration of cancer cells from tumor spheroids to the fluid flow. This work opens new avenues for exploring the metastatic cascade in vitro at physiologically relevant spatial and temporal scales.








Abstract
Advanced in vitro systems such as multicellular spheroids and lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip devices have been developed, but often fall short in reproducing the tissue scale and self&#8208;organization of human diseases. A bioprinted artificial tumor model is introduced with endothelial and stromal cells self&#8208;organizing into perfusable and functional vascular structures. This model uses 3D hydrogel matrices to embed multicellular tumor spheroids, allowing them to grow to mesoscopic scales and to interact with endothelial cells. It is shown that angiogenic multicellular tumor spheroids promote the growth of a vascular network, which in turn further enhances the growth of cocultivated tumor spheroids. The self&#8208;developed vascular structure infiltrates the tumor spheroids, forms functional connections with the bioprinted endothelium, and can be perfused by erythrocytes and polystyrene microspheres. Moreover, cancer cells migrate spontaneously from the tumor spheroid through the self&#8208;assembled vascular network into the fluid flow. Additionally, tumor type specific characteristics of desmoplasia, angiogenesis, and metastatic propensity are preserved between patient&#8208;derived samples and tumors derived from this same material growing in the bioreactors. Overall, this modular approach opens up new avenues for studying tumor pathophysiology and cellular interactions in vitro, providing a platform for advanced drug testing while reducing the need for in vivo experimentation.

         <title>Highly Robust Conductive Organo&#8208;Hydrogels with Powerful Sensing Capabilities Under Large Mechanical Stress</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly robust conductive organo&#8208;hydrogels are fabricated via self&#8208;assembly assisted stretch training. The fabricated conductive organo&#8208;hydrogels exhibit remarkable strength and toughness, as well as impressive sensitivity even when subjected to significant stress. This study addresses the mechanical limitations of traditional conductive hydrogels, making them suitable for facing the practical complex conditions in motion monitoring of strenuous activities and the soft robotics.








Abstract
The low mechanical strength of conductive hydrogels (&lt;1&#160;MPa) has been a significant hurdle in their practical application, as they are prone to fracturing under complex conditions, limiting their effectiveness. Here, this work fabricates a strong and tough conductive hierarchical poly(vinyl alcohol) (PEDOT:PSS/PVA) organo&#8208;hydrogel (PPS organo&#8208;hydrogel) via a facile combining strategy of self&#8208;assembly and stretch training. With PVA/PEDOT:PSS microlayers and aligned PVA/PEDOT:PSS nanofibers, PVA and PEDOT:PSS nanocrystalline domains, and semi&#8208;interpenetrating polymer networks, PPS organo&#8208;hydrogels display outstanding mechanical performances (strength: 54.8&#160;MPa, toughness: 153.97&#160;MJ m&#8722;3). Additionally, PPS organo&#8208;hydrogels also exhibit powerful sensing capabilities (gauge factor (GF): 983) due to the aligned hierarchical structures and organic liquid phase of DMSO. Notably, with the synergy of such mechanical and sensing properties, organo&#8208;hydrogels can even detect objects as light as 1 gram, despite bearing a tensile strength of &#8776;23&#160;MPa. By incorporating these materials into human&#8208;machine interfaces, such as controlling artificial arms for grabbing objects and monitoring sport behaviors in soccer training, this work has unlocked a new realm of possibilities for these high&#8208;performance hierarchical organo&#8208;hydrogels. This approach to designing hierarchical structures has the potential to lead to even more high&#8208;performance hydrogels in the future.

         <title>High Thermoelectric Power Factors in Plastic/Ductile Bulk SnSe2&#8208;Based Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a power factor of 18.0 &#181;W cm&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 in plastic/ductile bulk SnSe2&#8208;based crystals is reported. The origin of such high power factor is from the modulation of material's stacking forms and polymorph crystal structures via simultaneously doping Cl/Br at Se&#8208;site and intercalating Cu inside the van der Waals gap, which significantly enhances the carrier concentration and mobility.








Abstract
The recently discovered plastic/ductile inorganic thermoelectric (TE) materials open a new avenue for the fabrication of high&#8208;efficiently flexible TE devices, which can utilize the small temperature difference between human body and environment to generate electricity. However, the maximum power factor (PF) of current plastic/ductile TE materials is usually around or less than 10 &#181;W cm&#8722;1 K&#8722;2, much lower than the classic brittle TE materials. In this work, a record&#8208;high PF of 18.0 &#181;W cm&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 at 375 K in plastic/ductile bulk SnSe2&#8208;based crystals is reported, superior to all the plastic inorganic TE materials and flexible organic TE materials reported before. The origin of such high PF is from the modulation of material's stacking forms and polymorph crystal structures via simultaneously doping Cl/Br at Se&#8208;site and intercalating Cu inside the van der Waals gap, leading to the significantly enhanced carrier concentrations and mobilities. An in&#8208;plane fully flexible TE device made of the plastic/ductile SnSe2&#8208;based crystals is successfully developed to show a record&#8208;high normalized maximum power density to 0.18&#160;W m&#8722;1 under a temperature difference of 30 K. This work indicates that the plastic/ductile material can realize high TE power factor to achieve large output electric power density in flexible TE technology.

However, the maximum power factor (&lt;i&gt;PF&lt;/i&gt;) of current plastic/ductile TE materials is usually around or less than 10 &#181;W cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, much lower than the classic brittle TE materials. In this work, a record-high &lt;i&gt;PF&lt;/i&gt; of 18.0 &#181;W cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 375 K in plastic/ductile bulk SnSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based crystals is reported, superior to all the plastic inorganic TE materials and flexible organic TE materials reported before. The origin of such high &lt;i&gt;PF&lt;/i&gt; is from the modulation of material's stacking forms and polymorph crystal structures via simultaneously doping Cl/Br at Se-site and intercalating Cu inside the van der Waals gap, leading to the significantly enhanced carrier concentrations and mobilities. An in-plane fully flexible TE device made of the plastic/ductile SnSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based crystals is successfully developed to show a record-high normalized maximum power density to 0.18&#160;W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under a temperature difference of 30 K. This work indicates that the plastic/ductile material can realize high TE power factor to achieve large output electric power density in flexible TE technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Clinically Relevant Probiotics with Switchable &#8220;Nano&#8208;Promoter&#8221; and &#8220;Nano&#8208;Effector&#8221; for Precision Tumor Therapy</title>

Dynamic regulation of the metabolism of probiotics for precise colorectal cancer therapy by using inducible artificial enzymes as switchable &#8220;nano&#8208;promoter&#8221; to upregulate the expression of acidic metabolites in probiotics and &#8220;nano&#8208;effector&#8221; to produce a great deal of lethal reactive oxygen species (ROS) to combat the tumors.








Abstract
Probiotics have the potential as biotherapeutic agents for cancer management in preclinical models and human trials by secreting antineoplastic or immunoregulatory agents in the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, current probiotics lack the ability to dynamically respond to unique TME characteristics, leading to limited therapeutic accuracy and efficacy. Although progress has been made in customizing controllable probiotics through synthetic biology, the engineering process is complex and the predictability of production is relatively low. To address this, here, for the first time, this work adopts pH&#8208;dependent peroxidase&#8208;like (POD&#8208;like) artificial enzymes as both an inducible &#8220;nano&#8208;promoter&#8221; and &#8220;nano&#8208;effector&#8221; to engineer clinically relevant probiotics to achieve switchable control of probiotic therapy. The nanozyme initially serves as an inducible &#8220;nano&#8208;promoter,&#8221; generating trace amounts of nonlethal reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress to upregulate acidic metabolites in probiotics. Once metabolites acidify the TME to a threshold, the nanozyme switches to a &#8220;nano&#8208;effector,&#8221; producing a great deal of lethal ROS to fight cancer. This approach shows promise in subcutaneous, orthotopic, and colitis&#8208;associated colorectal cancer tumors, offering a new methodology for modulating probiotic metabolism in a pathological environment.

         <title>A Highly&#8208;Efficient Boron Interstitially Inserted Ru Anode Catalyst for Anion Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron interstitially inserted Ru catalyst (B&#8208;Ru/C) is synthesized and used as an anode catalyst for anion exchange membrane fuel cell, achieving a peak power density of 1.37&#160;W cm&#8722;2. Moreover, an inflection point behavior in the pH&#8208;dependent hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics on B&#8208;Ru is observed, showing an anomalous behavior that the HOR activity under alkaline electrolyte surpasses acidic electrolyte.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is crucial for the commercialization of anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). Here, boron interstitially inserted ruthenium (B&#8208;Ru/C) is synthesized and used as an anode catalyst for AEMFC, achieving a peak power density of 1.37&#160;W cm&#8722;2, close to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art commercial PtRu catalyst. Unexpectedly, instead of the monotonous decline of HOR kinetics with pH as generally believed, an inflection point behavior in the pH&#8208;dependent HOR kinetics on B&#8208;Ru/C is observed, showing an anomalous behavior that the HOR activity under alkaline electrolyte surpasses acidic electrolyte. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations reveal that the upshifted d&#8208;band center of Ru after the intervention of interstitial boron can lead to enhanced adsorption ability of OH and H2O, which together with the reduced energy barrier of water formation, contributes to the outstanding alkaline HOR performance with a mass activity of 1.716&#160;mA &#181;gPGM&#8722;1, which is 13.4&#8208;fold and 5.2&#8208;fold higher than that of Ru/C and commercial Pt/C, respectively.

         <title>Indoor Self&#8208;Powered Perovskite Optoelectronics with Ultraflexible Monochromatic Light Source</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultraflexible self&#8208;powered perovskite sensors are developed by integrating high&#8208;performance solar cells and monochromatic light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). These ultraflexible perovskite solar cell modules power ultraflexible perovskite nanocrystal LEDs (PNC&#8208;LEDs) even with the indoor light, with excellent power&#8208;conversion and current efficiencies of 18.2% and 15.2&#160;cd A&#8722;1, respectively. The narrowband electroluminescence (EL) of PNC&#8208;LED eliminates Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot (FP) interference, resulting selective photo&#8208;plethysmography with a signal selectivity of 98.2%.








Abstract
Self&#8208;powered skin optoelectronics fabricated on ultrathin polymer films is emerging as one of the most promising components for the next&#8208;generation Internet of Things (IoT) technology. However, a longstanding challenge is the device underperformance owing to the low process temperature of polymer substrates. In addition, broadband electroluminescence (EL) based on organic or polymer semiconductors inevitably suffers from periodic spectral distortion due to Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot (FP) interference upon substrate bending, preventing advanced applications. Here, ultraflexible skin optoelectronics integrating high&#8208;performance solar cells and monochromatic light&#8208;emitting diodes using solution&#8208;processed perovskite semiconductors is presented. n&#8211;i&#8211;p perovskite solar cells and perovskite nanocrystal light&#8208;emitting diodes (PNC&#8208;LEDs), with power&#8208;conversion and current efficiencies of 18.2% and 15.2&#160;cd A&#8722;1, respectively, are demonstrated on ultrathin polymer substrates with high thermal stability, which is a record&#8208;high efficiency for ultraflexible perovskite solar cell. The narrowband EL with a full width at half&#8208;maximum of 23&#160;nm successfully eliminates FP interference, yielding bending&#8208;insensitive spectra even under 50% of mechanical compression. Photo&#8208;plethysmography using the skin optoelectronic device demonstrates a signal selectivity of 98.2% at 87&#160;bpm pulse. The results presented here pave the way to inexpensive and high&#8208;performance ultrathin optoelectronics for self&#8208;powered applications such as wearable displays and indoor IoT sensors.

         <title>Reversible Ultrafast Chiroptical Responses in Planar Plasmonic Nano&#8208;Oligomer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides a comprehensive analysis of ultrafast chiroptical responses in planar plasmonic nano&#8208;oligomers with facile reversibility. The polarimetric measurements demonstrate the transient helicity&#8208;resolved optical transitions in chiral nanoplasmonics in an all&#8208;optical setting, providing a framework for future applications of ultrafast switching and optical logic circuits in nanophotonics and quantum optics.








Abstract
Ultracompact chiral plasmonic nanostructures with unique chiral light&#8211;matter interactions are vital for future photonic technologies. However, previous studies are limited to reporting their steady&#8208;state performance, presenting a fundamental obstacle to the development of high&#8208;speed optical devices with polarization sensitivity. Here, a comprehensive analysis of ultrafast chiroptical response of chiral gold nano&#8208;oligomers using time&#8208;resolved polarimetric measurements is provided. Significant differences are observed in terms of the absorption intensity, thus hot electron generation, and hot carrier decay time upon polarized photopumping, which are explained by a phenomenological model of the helicity&#8208;resolved optical transitions. Moreover, the chiroptical signal is switchable by reversing the direction of the pump pulse, demonstrating the versatile modulation of polarization selection in a single device. The results offer fundamental insights into the helicity&#8208;resolved optical transitions in photoexcited chiral plasmonics and can facilitate the development of high&#8208;speed polarization&#8208;sensitive flat optics with potential applications in nanophotonics and quantum optics.

The results offer fundamental insights into the helicity-resolved optical transitions in photoexcited chiral plasmonics and can facilitate the development of high-speed polarization-sensitive flat optics with potential applications in nanophotonics and quantum optics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>p&#8208;Phenylenediamine&#8208;Bridged Binder&#8208;Electrolyte&#8208;Unified Supramolecules for Versatile Lithium Secondary Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A binder&#8208;electrolyte integrated solid&#8208;state battery (SSB) system exploiting a new synergistic ionic conduction mechanism through supramolecular bridging with p&#8208;phenylenediamine molecules is proposed. As such, the contact issue in SSBs can be minimized, enabling the implementation of high loading SSB systems. These achievements are expected to provide a strong foundation for the development of SSB systems with exceptional energy density.








Abstract
The binder is an essential component in determining the structural integrity and ionic conductivity of Li&#8208;ion battery electrodes. However, conventional binders are not sufficiently conductive and durable to be used with solid&#8208;state electrolytes. In this study, a novel system is proposed for a Li secondary battery that combines the electrolyte and binder into a unified structure, which is achieved by employing para&#8208;phenylenediamine (pPD) moiety to create supramolecular bridges between the parent binders. Due to a partial crosslinking effect and charge&#8208;transferring structure of pPD, the proposed strategy improves both the ionic conductivity and mechanical properties by a factor of 6.4 (achieving a conductivity of 3.73 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 for poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;pPD) and 4.4 (reaching a mechanical strength of 151.4&#160;kPa for poly(acrylic acid)&#8208;pPD) compared to those of conventional parent binders. As a result, when the supramolecules of pPD are used as a binder in a pouch cell with a lean electrolyte loading of 2&#160;&#181;L mAh&#8722;1, a capacity retention of 80.2% is achieved even after 300 cycles. Furthermore, when it is utilized as a solid&#8208;state electrolyte, an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% and capacity retention of 98.7% are attained under operations at 50&#160;&#176;C without external pressure or a pre&#8208;aging process.

         <title>Scalable Photochromic Film for Solar Heat and Daylight Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochromic (PC) film that simultaneously regulates solar heat and visible light entrance is introduced. On a sunny day, the film tints and blocks sunlight, which reduces energy consumption for cooling and&#160;preventing excessive brightness and glare. With weak sunlight intensity, the photochromic film becomes transparent to let sunlight enter the room, which prevents additional heating and lighting energy use.








Abstract
The adaptive control of sunlight through photochromic smart windows could have a huge impact on the energy efficiency and daylight comfort in buildings. However, the fabrication of inorganic nanoparticle and polymer composite photochromic films with a high contrast ratio and high transparency/low haze remains a challenge. Here, a solution method is presented for the in situ growth of copper&#8208;doped tungsten trioxide nanoparticles in polymethyl methacrylate, which allows a low&#8208;cost preparation of photochromic films with a high luminous&#160;transparency (luminous transmittance Tlum = 91%) and scalability (30 &#215; 350 cm2). High modulation of visible light (&#916;Tlum = 73%) and solar heat (modulation of solar transmittance &#916;Tsol = 73%, modulation of solar heat gain coefficient &#916;SHGC = 0.5) of the film improves the indoor daylight comfort and energy efficiency. Simulation results show that low&#8208;e windows with the photochromic film applied can greatly enhance the energy efficiency and daylight comfort. This photochromic film presents an attractive strategy for achieving more energy&#8208;efficient buildings and carbon neutrality to combat global climate change.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Low Current 10 nm Spin Hall Nano&#8208;Oscillators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin Hall nano&#8208;oscillators as narrow as 10 nm, with auto&#8208;oscillation threshold currents below 30 &#956;$\umu$A, are experimentally demonstrated and studied using electrical microwave measurements and optical micro&#8208;Brillouin light scattering microscopy. The current shunting issue through the Si substrate is successfully addressed using different insulating seed layers, with ultra&#8208;thin Al2O3 showing the best performance and SiO2 the worst.








Abstract
Nano&#8208;constriction based spin Hall nano&#8208;oscillators (SHNOs) are at the forefront of spintronics research for emerging technological applications, such as oscillator&#8208;based neuromorphic computing and Ising Machines. However, their miniaturization to the sub&#8208;50 nm width regime results in poor scaling of the threshold current. Here, it shows that current shunting through the Si substrate is the origin of this problem and studies how different seed layers can mitigate it. It finds that an ultra&#8208;thin Al2O3 seed layer and SiN (200 nm) coated p&#8208;Si substrates provide the best improvement, enabling us to scale down the SHNO width to a truly nanoscopic dimension of 10 nm, operating at threshold currents below 30 &#956;$\umu$A. In addition, the combination of electrical insulation and high thermal conductivity of the Al2O3 seed will offer the best conditions for large SHNO arrays, avoiding any significant temperature gradients within the array. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ultra&#8208;low operational current SHNOs hence pave an energy&#8208;efficient route to scale oscillator&#8208;based computing to large dynamical neural networks of linear chains or 2D&#160;arrays.

         <title>Cascade Catalytic Nanoparticles Selectively Alkalize Cancerous Lysosomes to Suppress Cancer Progression and Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cascade catalytic nanoparticle with high biocompatibility is reported, serving as a potent lysosomal alkalizer capable of converting excessive hydrogen peroxide and H+ into hydroxide ions only in cancerous lysosomes, leading to lysosomal alkalization and consequent suppression of tumor progression and metastasis.








Abstract
Lysosomes are critical in modulating the progression and metastasis for various cancers. There is currently an unmet need for lysosomal alkalizers that can selectively and safely alter the pH and inhibit the function of cancer lysosomes. Here an effective, selective, and safe lysosomal alkalizer is reported that can inhibit autophagy and suppress tumors in mice. The lysosomal alkalizer consists of an iron oxide core that generates hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) in the presence of excessive H+ and hydrogen peroxide inside cancer lysosomes and cerium oxide satellites that capture and convert &#8226;OH into hydroxide ions. Alkalized lysosomes, which display impaired enzyme activity and autophagy, lead to cancer cell apoptosis. It is shown that the alkalizer effectively inhibits both local and systemic tumor growth and metastasis in mice. This work demonstrates that the intrinsic properties of nanoparticles can be harnessed to build effective lysosomal alkalizers that are both selective and safe.

         <title>Spin Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Enabled by 2D Chiral Perovskite with Spin&#8208;Dependent Carrier Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin quantum dot light emitting diode emitting circularly polarized light is achieved by introducing chiral perovskite with chiral induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect. The spin polarized holes generated by the CISS effect of chiral perovskite recombine with correspondent electrons according to the optical selective rules and directly emit left&#8208; or right&#8208;handed circularly polarized light.








Abstract
Chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect provides innovative approach to spintronics and quantum&#8208;based devices for chiral materials. Different from the conventional ferromagnetic devices, the application of CISS effect is potential to operate under room temperature and zero applied magnetic field. Low dimensional chiral perovskites by introducing chiral amines are beginning to show significant CISS effect for spin injection, but research on chiral perovskites is still in its infancy, especially on spin&#8208;light emitting diode (spin&#8208;LED) construction. Here, the spin&#8208;QLEDs enabled by 2D chiral perovskites as CISS layer for spin&#8208;dependent carrier injection and CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) as light emitting layer are reported. The regulation pattern of the chirality and thickness of chiral perovskites, which affects the circularly polarized electroluminescence (CP&#8208;EL) emission of spin&#8208;QLED, is discovered. Notably, the spin injection polarization of 2D chiral perovskites is higher than 80% and the CP&#8208;EL asymmetric factor (gCP&#8208;EL) achieves up to 1.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2. Consequently, this work opens up a new and effective approach for high&#8208;performance spin&#8208;LEDs.

         <title>Deep Learning&#8208;Assisted Active Metamaterials with Heat&#8208;Enhanced Thermal Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Drawing parallels from nonlinear optics, artificial intelligence assists a configurable nonlinear thermal material whose effective thermal conductivity being responsive to its temperature gradient. Such deep learning&#8208;assisted nonlinear thermal material promotes two typical self&#8208;adaptive devices, which can perceive their environment deeply. One maintains stable function, and another switches its function, in a changeable environment.








Abstract
Heat management is crucial for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications such as passive radiative cooling, thermally adjustable wearables, and camouflage systems. Their adaptive versions, to cater to varied requirements, lean on the potential of adaptive metamaterials. Existing efforts, however, feature with highly anisotropic parameters, narrow working&#8208;temperature ranges, and the need for manual intervention, which remain long&#8208;term and tricky obstacles for the most advanced self&#8208;adaptive metamaterials. To surmount these barriers, heat&#8208;enhanced thermal diffusion metamaterials powered by deep learning is introduced. Such active metamaterials can automatically sense ambient temperatures and swiftly, as well as continuously, adjust their thermal functions with a high degree of tunability. They maintain robust thermal performance even when external thermal fields change direction, and both simulations and experiments demonstrate exceptional results. Furthermore, two metadevices with on&#8208;demand adaptability, performing distinctive features with isotropic materials, wide working temperatures, and spontaneous response are designed. This work offers a framework for the design of intelligent thermal diffusion metamaterials and can be expanded to other diffusion fields, adapting to increasingly complex and dynamic environments.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Mediated Recombination Dynamics in Perovskite&#8208;Based Memory Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes for Neuromorphic Control Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;pixel perovskite&#8208;organic tandem light&#8208;emitting diode capable of changing colors is demonstrated. The distinctive dual time constants (fast organic emission and slow perovskite emission) are analogous to a biological synapse. High dynamic range and color&#8208;switching capabilities in pulsed emission are used in neuromorphic computing to improve the efficiencies of applications that are conventionally memory&#8208;intensive.








Abstract
Neuromorphic devices can help perform memory&#8208;heavy tasks more efficiently due to the co&#8208;localization of memory and computing. In biological systems, fast dynamics are necessary for rapid communication, while slow dynamics aid in the amplification of signals over noise and regulatory processes such as adaptation&#8208; such dual dynamics are key for neuromorphic control systems. Halide perovskites exhibit much more complex phenomena than conventional semiconductors due to their coupled ionic, electronic, and optical properties which result in modulatable drift, diffusion of ions, carriers, and radiative recombination dynamics. This is exploited to engineer a dual&#8208;emitter tandem device with the requisite dual slow&#8208;fast dynamics. Here, a perovskite&#8208;organic tandem light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) capable of modulating its emission spectrum and intensity owing to the ion&#8208;mediated recombination zone modulation between the green&#8208;emitting quasi&#8208;2D perovskite layer and the red&#8208;emitting organic layer is introduced. Frequency&#8208;dependent response and high dynamic range memory of emission intensity and spectra in a LED are demonstrated. Utilizing the emissive read&#8208;out, image contrast enhancement as a neuromorphic pre&#8208;processing step to improve pattern recognition capabilities is illustrated. As proof of concept using the device's slow&#8208;fast dynamics, an inhibition of the return mechanism is physically emulated.

         <title>Air&#8208;Working Electrochromic Artificial Muscles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This manuscript describes the first electrochemical artificial muscle that can realize color&#8208;changing and actuation dual responses in air, which effectively solves the problem of connection of the electrolyte with the active layer during the operation of independently operating electrochemically actuated devices in air by hot pouring of the rapidly cooling electrolyte layer.








Abstract
Artificial muscles are indispensable components for next&#8208;generation robotics to mimic the sophisticated movements of living systems and provide higher output energies when compared with real muscles. However, artificial muscles actuated by electrochemical ion injection have problems with single actuation properties and difficulties in stable operation in air. Here, air&#8208;working electrochromic artificial muscles (EAMs) with both color&#8208;changing and actuation functions are reported, which are constructed based on vanadium pentoxide nanowires and carbon tube yarn. Each EAM can generate a contractile stroke of &#8776;12% during stable operation in the air with multiple color changes (yellow&#8208;green&#8208;gray) under &#177;4&#160;V actuation voltages. The reflectance contrast is as high as 51%, demonstrating the excellent versatility of the EAMs. In addition, a torroidal EAM arrangement with fast response and high resilience is constructed. The EAM's contractile stroke can be displayed through visual color changes, which provides new ideas for future artificial muscle applications in soft robots and artificial limbs.

         <title>Nanoscale Chemical Diversity of Coke Deposits on Nanoprinted Metal Catalysts Visualized by Tip&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coke formation is a prime cause of catalyst deactivation, where undesired carbon products block the catalytic active sites and impede further reaction. Herein, the nanofabrication of metal catalysts is synergized with advanced coke characterization via tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy. This approach reveals the chemical diversity of coke deposits at the nanoscale, opening novel routes for extending the catalyst's lifespan.








Abstract
Coke formation is the prime cause of catalyst deactivation, where undesired carbon wastes block the catalyst surface and hinder further reaction in a broad gamut of industrial chemical processes. Yet, the origins of coke formation and their distribution across the catalyst remain elusive, obstructing the design of coke&#8208;resistant catalysts. Here, the first&#8208;time application of tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) is demonstrated as a nanoscale chemical probe to localize and identify coke deposits on a post&#8208;mortem metal nanocatalyst. Monitoring coke at the nanoscale circumvents bulk averaging and reveals the local nature of coke with unmatched detail. The nature of coke is chemically diverse and ranges from nanocrystalline graphite to disordered and polymeric coke, even on a single nanoscale location of a top&#8208;down nanoprinted SiO2&#8208;supported Pt catalyst. Surprisingly, not all Pt is an equal producer of coke, where clear isolated coke &#8220;hotspots&#8221; are present non&#8208;homogeneously on Pt which generate large amounts of disordered coke. After their formation, coke shifts to the support and undergoes long&#8208;range transport on the surrounding SiO2 surface, where it becomes more graphitic. The presented results provide novel guidelines to selectively free&#8208;up the coked metal surface at more mild rejuvenation conditions, thus securing the long&#8208;term catalyst stability.

After their formation, coke shifts to the support and undergoes long-range transport on the surrounding SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; surface, where it becomes more graphitic. The presented results provide novel guidelines to selectively free-up the coked metal surface at more mild rejuvenation conditions, thus securing the long-term catalyst stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Construct Robust Epitaxial Growth of (101) Textured Zinc Metal Anode for Long Life and High Capacity in Mild Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel (101) epitaxial growth model that enables robust epitaxial growth at high capacity is proposed here. Additionally, side reactions are effectively suppressed due to the low grain boundary area. The constructed texture zinc achieves excellent stability, which provides an effective and feasible approach for the protection and practical application of zinc metal.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries are considered to have the potential for energy storage due to their high safety and low cost. However, the practical applications of zinc batteries are limited by dendrite growth and side reactions. Epitaxial growth is considered an effective method for stabilizing Zn anode, especially for manipulating the (002) plane of deposited zinc. However, (002) texture zinc is difficult to achieve stable cycle at high capacity due to its large lattice distortion and uneven electric field distribution. Here, a novel zinc anode with highly (101) texture (denoted as (101)&#8208;Zn) is constructed. Due to unique directional guidance and strong bonding effect, (101)&#8208;Zn can achieve dense vertical electroepitaxy in near&#8208;neutral electrolytes. In addition, the low grain boundary area inhibits the occurrence of side reactions. The resultant (101)&#8208;Zn symmetric cells exhibit excellent stability over 5300 h (4 mA cm&#8722;2 for 2 mAh cm&#8722;2) and 330 h (15 mA cm&#8722;2 for 10 mAh cm&#8722;2). Meanwhile, the cycle life of Zn//MnO2 full cell is meaningfully improved over 1000 cycles.

         <title>Lowering the Temperature of Solid Oxide Electrochemical Cells Using Triple&#8208;Doped Bismuth Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exceptionally conductive and stable bismuth oxides are developed through the rational doping of isovalent and aliovalent elements for low&#8208;temperature applications. The triple&#8208;doped bismuth oxides are incorporated into composite oxygen electrodes and bilayer electrolytes for low&#8208;temperature solid oxide electrochemical cells, resulting in unprecedentedly high performance in both fuel cell and electrolysis cell modes.








Abstract
Despite the great potential of solid oxide electrochemical cells (SOCs) as highly efficient energy conversion devices, the undesirable high operating temperature limits their wider applicability. Herein, a novel approach to developing high&#8208;performance low&#8208;temperature SOCs (LT&#8208;SOCs) is presented through the use of an Er, Y, and Zr triple&#8208;doped bismuth oxide (EYZB). This study demonstrates that EYZB exhibits &gt; 147 times higher ionic conductivity of 0.44 S cm&#8722;1 at 600 &#176;C compared to commercial Y&#8208;stabilized zirconia electrolyte with excellent stability over 1000&#160;h. By rationally incorporating EYZB in composite electrodes and bilayer electrolytes, the zirconia&#8208;based electrolyte LT&#8208;SOC achieves the unprecedentedly high performance of 3.45 and 2.02&#160;W cm&#8722;2 in the fuel cell mode and 2.08 and 0.95 A cm&#8722;2 in the electrolysis cell mode at 700 &#176;C and 600 &#176;C, respectively. Further, a distinctive microstructural feature of EYZB that largely extends triple phase boundary at the interface is revealed through digital twinning. This work provides insights for developing high&#8208;performance LT&#8208;SOCs.

         <title>Phosphorescent Carbene&#8208;Gold&#8208;Arylacetylide Materials as Emitters for Near UV&#8208;OLEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbene&#8208;gold&#8208;acetylide (CMAc) complexes are bright deep&#8208;blue and green phosphorescent emitters with quantum yields up to 43% which also show UV prompt&#8208;fluorescence. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on CMAc emitters show near&#8208;UV electroluminescence with a device efficiency of 1% and a device lifetime LT50 up to 20&#160;min at practical brightness.








Abstract
A series of carbene&#8208;gold&#8208;acetylide complexes [(BiCAAC)AuCC]nC6H5&#8722;n (n = 1, Au1; n = 2, Au2; n = 3, Au3; BiCAAC = bicyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbene) have been synthesized in high yields. Compounds Au1&#8211;Au3 exhibit deep&#8208;blue to blue&#8208;green phosphorescence with good quantum yields up to 43% in all media. An increase of the (BiCAAC)Au moieties in gold complexes Au1&#8211;Au3 increases the extinction coefficients in the UV&#8211;vis spectra and stronger oscillator strength coefficients supported by theoretical calculations. The luminescence radiative rates decrease with an increase of the (BiCAAC)Au moieties. The time&#8208;dependent density functional theory study supports a charge&#8208;transfer nature of the phosphorescence due to the large (0.5&#8211;0.6&#160;eV) energy gap between singlet excited (S1) and triplet excited (T1) states. Transient luminescence study reveals the presence of both nonstructured UV prompt&#8208;fluorescence and vibronically resolved long&#8208;lived phosphorescence 428&#160;nm. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLED) are fabricated by physical vapor deposition with 2,8&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphoryl)dibenzo[b,d]furan (PPF) as a host material with complex Au1. The near&#8208;UV electroluminescence is observed at 405&#160;nm with device efficiency of 1% while demonstrating OLED device lifetime LT50 up to 20&#160;min at practical brightness of 10 nits, indicating a highly promising class of materials to develop stable UV&#8208;OLEDs.

         <title>A Data&#8208;Driven Approach to Molten Salt Synthesis of N&#8208;Rich Carbon Adsorbents for Selective CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Design of experiments and response surface methodology applied to molten salt synthesis enable inverse design of N&#8208;rich nanoporous carbons for selective CO2 adsorption. Mapping the phase space of accessible N&#8208;rich turbostratic carbons reveals that a combination of moderate porosity with tuned interlayer d&#8208;spacing enables highly selective CO2 adsorption (even from dilute streams with only 4% CO2) due to molecular sieving.








Abstract
Applying a design of experiments methodology to the molten salt synthesis of nanoporous carbons enables inverse design and optimization of nitrogen (N)&#8208;rich carbon adsorbents with excellent CO2/N2 selectivity and appreciable CO2 capacity for carbon capture via swing adsorption from dilute gas mixtures such as natural gas combined cycle flue gas. This data&#8208;driven study reveals fundamental structure&#8208;function relationships between the synthesis conditions, physicochemical properties, and achievable selective adsorption performance of N&#8208;rich nanoporous carbons derived from molten salt synthesis for CO2 capture. Taking advantage of size&#8208;sieving separation of CO2 (3.30 &#197;) from N2 (3.64 &#197;) within the turbostratic nanostructure of these N&#8208;rich carbons, while limiting deleterious N2 adsorption in a weaker adsorption site that harms selectivity, enables a large CO2 capacity (0.73&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 at 30.4&#160;Torr and 30 &#176;C) with noteworthy concurrent CO2/N2 selectivity as predicted by the ideal adsorbed solution theory&#160;(SIAST = 246) with an adsorbed phase purity of 91% from a simulated gas stream containing only 4% CO2. Optimized N&#8208;rich porous carbons, with good physicochemical stability, low cost, and moderate regeneration energy, can achieve performance for selective CO2 adsorption that competes with other classes of advanced porous materials such as chemisorbing zeolites and functionalized metal&#8208;organic frameworks.

Taking advantage of size-sieving separation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (3.30 &#197;) from N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (3.64 &#197;) within the turbostratic nanostructure of these N-rich carbons, while limiting deleterious N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption in a weaker adsorption site that harms selectivity, enables a large CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capacity (0.73&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 30.4&#160;Torr and 30 &#176;C) with noteworthy concurrent CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity as predicted by the ideal adsorbed solution theory&#160;(&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;IAST&lt;/sub&gt; = 246) with an adsorbed phase purity of 91% from a simulated gas stream containing only 4% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Optimized N-rich porous carbons, with good physicochemical stability, low cost, and moderate regeneration energy, can achieve performance for selective CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption that competes with other classes of advanced porous materials such as chemisorbing zeolites and functionalized metal-organic frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Large Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetoresistance in a High&#8208;Spin Donor&#8211;Acceptor Conjugated Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processable high&#8208;spin donor&#8211;acceptor conjugated polymer provides large negative magnetoresistance (MR) at low temperatures and positive MR at room temperature that correlates with its electronic and spin structure. The performance of a simple, monolithic device exceeds other organic materials including those utilized in conjunction with ferromagnetic electrodes or complex device architectures. These materials open new opportunities for emerging spin&#8208;based applications.








Abstract
Open&#8208;shell conjugated polymers (CPs) offer new opportunities for the development of emerging technologies that utilize the spin degree of freedom. Their light&#8208;element composition, weak spin&#8208;orbit coupling, synthetic modularity, high chemical stability, and solution&#8208;processability offer attributes that are unavailable from other semiconducting materials. However, developing an understanding of how electronic structure correlates with emerging transport phenomena remains central to their application. Here, the first connections between molecular, electronic, and solid&#8208;state transport in a high&#8208;spin donor&#8211;acceptor CP, poly(4&#8208;(4&#8208;(3,5&#8208;didodecylbenzylidene)&#8208;4H&#8208;cyclopenta[2,1&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b&#8217;]dithiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;6,7&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;[1,2,5]&#8208;thiadiazolo[3,4&#8208;g]quinoxaline), are provided. At low temperatures (T &lt; 180 K), a giant negative magnetoresistance (MR) is achieved in a thin&#8208;film device with a value of &#8722;98% at 10 K, which surpasses the performance of all other organic materials. The thermal depopulation of the high&#8208;spin manifold and negative MR decrease as temperature increases and at T &gt; 180 K, the MR becomes positive with a relatively large MR of 13.5% at room temperature. Variable temperature electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility measurements demonstrate that modulation of both the sign and magnitude of the MR correlates with the electronic and spin structure of the CP. These results indicate that donor&#8211;acceptor CPs with open&#8208;shell and high&#8208;spin ground states offer new opportunities for emerging spin&#8208;based applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Strength Amorphous Silicon Carbide for Nanomechanics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedented amorphous silicon carbide (a&#8208;SiC) thin film exhibits the highest ultimate tensile strength recorded for any nanostructured amorphous material, surpassing 10 GPa. This study showcases the fabrication of high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio a&#8208;SiC strings with quality factors exceeding 108, revealing significant potential for diverse high&#8208;performance applications, from nanomechanical sensors to space exploration, and offering newfound prospects for employing amorphous materials where strength and stability are crucial.








Abstract
For decades, mechanical resonators with high sensitivity have been realized using thin&#8208;film materials under high tensile loads. Although there are remarkable strides in achieving low&#8208;dissipation mechanical sensors by utilizing high tensile stress, the performance of even the best strategy is limited by the tensile fracture strength of the resonator materials. In this study, a wafer&#8208;scale amorphous thin film is uncovered, which has the highest ultimate tensile strength ever measured for a nanostructured amorphous material. This silicon carbide (SiC) material exhibits an ultimate tensile strength of over 10 GPa, reaching the regime reserved for strong crystalline materials and approaching levels experimentally shown in graphene nanoribbons. Amorphous SiC strings with high aspect ratios are fabricated, with mechanical modes exceeding quality factors 108 at room temperature, the highest value achieves among SiC resonators. These performances are demonstrated faithfully after characterizing the mechanical properties of the thin film using the resonance behaviors of free&#8208;standing resonators. This robust thin&#8208;film material has significant potential for applications in nanomechanical sensors, solar cells, biological applications, space exploration, and other areas requiring strength and stability in dynamic environments. The findings of this study open up new possibilities for the use of amorphous thin&#8208;film materials in high&#8208;performance&#160;applications.

         <title>UV&#8208;Curing Assisted Direct Ink Writing of Dense, Crack&#8208;Free, and High&#8208;Performance Zirconia&#8208;Based Composites With Aligned Alumina Platelets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid 3D printing by coupling UV&#8208;curing with direct ink writing is proposed to fabricate dense and crack&#8208;free ceramics. Non&#8208;reactive diluent relieves polymerization&#8208;induced stress, avoiding warpage and cracking, and facilitates de&#8208;binding. Benefiting from aligned platelets, this work highlights the possibilities of additively fabricating ceramics that are stronger than conventionally manufactured ceramics, along with the unprecedented potentials of locally tunable compositions.








Abstract
Additive manufacturing (AM) of high&#8208;performance structural ceramic components with comparative strength and toughness as conventionally manufactured ceramics remains challenging. Here, a UV&#8208;curing approach is integrated in direct ink writing (DIW), taking advantage from DIW to enable an easy use of high solid&#8208;loading pastes and multi&#8208;layered materials with compositional changes; while, avoiding drying problems. UV&#8208;curable opaque zirconia&#8208;based slurries with a solid loading of 51 vol% are developed to fabricate dense and crack&#8208;free alumina&#8208;toughened zirconia (ATZ) containing 3 wt% alumina platelets. Importantly, a non&#8208;reactive diluent is added to relieve polymerization&#8208;induced internal stresses, avoid subsequent warping and cracking, and facilitate the de&#8208;binding. For the first time, UV&#8208;curing assisted DIW&#8208;printed ceramic after sintering reveals even better mechanical properties than that processed by a conventional pressing. This is attributed to the aligned alumina platelets, enhancing crack deflection and improving the fracture toughness from 6.8 &#177; 0.3&#160;MPa m0.5 (compacted) to 7.4 &#177; 0.3&#160;MPa m0.5 (DIW). The four&#8208;point bending strength of the DIW ATZ (1009 &#177; 93&#160;MPa) is also higher than that of the conventionally manufactured equivalent (861 &#177; 68&#160;MPa). Besides homogeneous ceramic, laminate structures are demonstrated. This work provides a valuable hybrid approach to additively manufacture tough and strong ceramic components.

         <title>Self&#8208;Reconstruction of Highly Degraded LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 toward Stable Single&#8208;Crystalline Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple but effective LiOH&#8208;NaCl molten salt strategy is developed for recycling of highly degraded Ni&#8208;rich cathode (LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2) to performance&#8208;enhanced single&#8208;crystalline cathodes. The structural and chemical evolution during the recycling process is revealed. Meanwhile, this approach can also be successfully extended to recycle other cathode materials with varied Li and Ni compositions.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;growing demand for resources sustainability has promoted the recycle of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries to a strategic position. Direct recycle outperforms either hydrometallurgical or pyrometallurgical approaches due to the high added value and facile treatment processes. However, the traditional direct recycling technologies are only applicable for Ni&#8208;poor/middle cathodes. Herein, spent Ni&#8208;rich LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (S&#8208;NCM) to performance&#8208;enhanced single&#8208;crystalline cathode materials is directly recycled using a simple but effective LiOH&#8208;NaCl molten salt. The evolution process of the Li&#8208;supplement and grain&#8208;recrystallization during regeneration is systematically investigated, and the successful recovery of the highly degraded microstructure is comprehensively proven, including significant elimination of Ni2+ and O vacancies. Beneficial from the favorable reconstructed single&#8208;crystalline particles, the regenerated NCM (R&#8208;NCM) represents remarkably enhanced structural stability, electrochemical activity, O2 and cracks suppression during charge/discharge, thus achieving the excellent performances in long&#8208;term cycling and high&#8208;rate tests. As a result, R&#8208;NCM maintains the 86.5% reversible capacity at 1&#160;C after 200 cycles. Instructively, the present molten salt can be successfully applied for recycling spent NCMs with various Li and Ni compositions (e.g., LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2).

The structural and chemical evolution during the recycling process is revealed. Meanwhile, this approach can also be successfully extended to recycle other cathode materials with varied Li and Ni compositions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ever-growing demand for resources sustainability has promoted the recycle of spent lithium-ion batteries to a strategic position. Direct recycle outperforms either hydrometallurgical or pyrometallurgical approaches due to the high added value and facile treatment processes. However, the traditional direct recycling technologies are only applicable for Ni-poor/middle cathodes. Herein, spent Ni-rich LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (S-NCM) to performance-enhanced single-crystalline cathode materials is directly recycled using a simple but effective LiOH-NaCl molten salt. The evolution process of the Li-supplement and grain-recrystallization during regeneration is systematically investigated, and the successful recovery of the highly degraded microstructure is comprehensively proven, including significant elimination of Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and O vacancies. Beneficial from the favorable reconstructed single-crystalline particles, the regenerated NCM (R-NCM) represents remarkably enhanced structural stability, electrochemical activity, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and cracks suppression during charge/discharge, thus achieving the excellent performances in long-term cycling and high-rate tests. As a result, R-NCM maintains the 86.5% reversible capacity at 1&#160;C after 200 cycles. Instructively, the present molten salt can be successfully applied for recycling spent NCMs with various Li and Ni compositions (e.g., LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Fast Single&#8208;Nucleotide&#8208;Variation Detection Enabled by Argonaute&#8208;Mediated Transistor Platform</title>

Argonaute&#8208;mediated transistor platform monitors single nucleotide variation (SNV) in &#8776;20 copies mL&#8722;1 microRNA, ctDNA, viral RNA, and cDNA samples and achieves the fastest SNV detection in 5&#160;min with comprehensive advantages of specificity, sensitivity, easy operation, portability, and generality, benefiting efficient disease prevention and control as well as point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnoses for timely, precise, and convenient healthcare.








Abstract
&#8220;Test&#8208;and&#8208;go&#8221; single&#8208;nucleotide variation (SNV) detection within several minutes remains challenging, especially in low&#8208;abundance samples, since existing methods face a trade&#8208;off between sensitivity and testing speed. Sensitive detection usually relies on complex and time&#8208;consuming nucleic acid amplification or sequencing. Here, a graphene field&#8208;effect transistor (GFET) platform mediated by Argonaute protein that enables rapid, sensitive, and specific SNV detection is developed. The Argonaute protein provides a nanoscale binding channel to preorganize the DNA probe, accelerating target binding and rapidly recognizing SNVs with single&#8208;nucleotide resolution in unamplified tumor&#8208;associated microRNA, circulating tumor DNA, virus RNA, and reverse transcribed cDNA when a mismatch occurs in the seed region. An integrated microchip simultaneously detects multiple SNVs in agreement with sequencing results within 5&#160;min, achieving the fastest SNV detection in a &#8220;test&#8208;and&#8208;go&#8221; manner without the requirement of nucleic acid extraction, reverse transcription, and amplification.

         <title>B&#8208;N Covalent Bond Embedded Double Hetero&#8208;[n]helicenes for Pure Red Narrowband Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence with High Efficiency and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here the first pair of pure&#8208;red circularly polarized (CP) multiple resonance emitters is presented using a boron&#8208;nitrogen covalent bond to lower the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the boron atom, and devices possessing maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 36.6% are constructed, circularly polarizing electroluminescence with dissymmetry factor of 1.91 &#215; 10&#8722;3 and a long operational lifetime of &gt; 400 h.








Abstract
Chiral B/N embedded multi&#8208;resonance (MR) emitters&#160;open a new paradigm of circularly polarized (CP) organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) owing to their unique narrowband spectra. However, pure&#8208;red CP&#8208;MR emitters and devices remain exclusive in literature. Herein, by introducing a B&#8208;N covalent bond to lower the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the para&#8208;positioned B&#8208;&#960;&#8208;B motif, the first&#160;pair of pure&#8208;red double hetero&#8208;[n]helicenes (n = 6 and 7) CP&#8208;MR emitter peaking 617&#160;nm with a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 38&#160;nm and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of &#8776;100% in toluene is developed. The intense mirror&#8208;image CP light produced by the enantiomers is characterized by high photoluminescence dissymmetry factors (gPL) of +1.40/&#8722;1.41 &#215; 10&#8722;3 from their stable helicenes configuration. The corresponding devices using these enantiomers afford impressive CP electroluminescence dissymmetry factors (gEL) of +1.91/&#8722;1.77 &#215; 10&#8722;3, maximum external quantum efficiencies of 36.6%/34.4% and Commission Internationale de I&#8217;&#201;clairage coordinates of (0.67, 0.33), exactly satisfying the red&#8208;color requirement specified by National Television Standards Committee (NTSC) standard. Notably a remarkable long LT95 (operational time to 95% of the initial luminance) of &#8776;400 h at an initial brightness of 10,000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 is also observed for the same device, representing the most stable CP&#8208;OLED up to date.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Wide&#8208;Narrow Bandgap&#8208;Laminated Perovskite Photodetector with Bipolar Photoresponse for Secure Optical Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bipolar photoresponse based on spontaneously formed wide&#8208;narrow bandgap&#8208;laminated perovskite films by BiI3&#160;doping is demonstrated. Under the visible/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light, corresponding electrons are easier to be separated and transported by the SnO2/PC61BM to the bottom/top electrodes. Benefiting from the wavelength&#8208;dependent bipolar response, the signal secure optical communication (SOC) system is realized based on hidden properties of the bipolar signals.








Abstract
Perovskite photodetectors with bipolar photoresponse characteristics are expected to be applied in the field of secure optical communication (SOC). However, how to realize the perovskite photodetector with bipolar response remains challenging. Herein, by introducing bismuth iodide (BiI3) into Sn&#8208;Pb mixed perovskite precursor solution, 2D perovskite FA3Bi2I9 is spontaneously formed at the bottom to realize a wide&#8208;narrow bandgap&#8208;laminated perovskite film. Wavelength&#8208;dependent bipolar response is realized based on the absorption difference of the photoactive region with different bandgap combined with the carrier competition of the homotypic transport layer adopted in the as&#8208;fabricated photodetector. Under the visible/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light irradiation, the bottom/top of the film generates a higher carrier concentration, where electrons are easier to be separated and transported by the SnO2/PC61BM to the bottom/top electrodes, respectively, resulting in a negative and positive bipolar response. Finally, based on positive NIR signal as the effective signal and negative visible signal as the interference signal, the SOC system is realized, where the positive NIR signal is well hidden by the negative visible signal. This work provides a simple and feasible strategy for fabrication of laminated perovskite films to achieve bipolar response.

         <title>Understanding the Heterointerfaces in Perovskite Solar Cells via Hole Selective Layer Surface Functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
ODPA self&#8208;assembly monolayer (SAM) modifies HTL&#8208;Perovskite interface without altering crystallography. It highlights film and device quality improvements through interfacial defect reduction, followed by a detailed analysis of efficiency, stability, and charge carrier dynamics. Increased band&#8208;to&#8208;band recombination in photoluminescence and electroluminescence indicates enhanced effective photogenerated carrier density, supporting the use of phosphonic acid&#8208;based SAMs for surface passivation in perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Interfaces in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) play a pivotal role in determining device performance by influencing charge transport and recombination. Understanding the physical processes at these interfaces is essential for achieving high&#8208;power conversion efficiency in PSCs. Particularly, the interfaces involving oxide&#8208;based transport layers are susceptible to defects like dangling bonds, excess oxygen, or oxygen deficiency. To address this issue, the surface of NiOx is passivated using octadecylphosphonic acid (ODPA), resulting in improved charge transport across the perovskite hole transport layer (HTL) interface. This surface treatment has led to the development of hysteresis&#8208;free devices with an impressive &#8776;13% increase in power conversion efficiency. Computational studies have explored the halide perovskite architecture of ODPA&#8208;treated HTL/Perovskite, aiming to unlock superior photovoltaic performance. The ODPA surface functionalization has demonstrated enhanced device performance, characterized by superior charge exchange capacity. Moreover, higher band&#8208;to&#8208;band recombination in photoluminescence and electroluminescence indicates presence of lower mid&#8208;gap energy states, thereby increasing the effective photogenerated carrier density. These findings are expected to promote the utilization of various phosphonic acid&#8208;based self&#8208;assembly monolayers for surface passivation of oxide&#8208;based transport layers in perovskite solar cells.

&lt;p&gt;ODPA self-assembly monolayer (SAM) modifies HTL-Perovskite interface without altering crystallography. It highlights film and device quality improvements through interfacial defect reduction, followed by a detailed analysis of efficiency, stability, and charge carrier dynamics. Increased band-to-band recombination in photoluminescence and electroluminescence indicates enhanced effective photogenerated carrier density, supporting the use of phosphonic acid-based SAMs for surface passivation in perovskite solar cells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interfaces in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) play a pivotal role in determining device performance by influencing charge transport and recombination. Understanding the physical processes at these interfaces is essential for achieving high-power conversion efficiency in PSCs. Particularly, the interfaces involving oxide-based transport layers are susceptible to defects like dangling bonds, excess oxygen, or oxygen deficiency. To address this issue, the surface of NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; is passivated using octadecylphosphonic acid (ODPA), resulting in improved charge transport across the perovskite hole transport layer (HTL) interface. This surface treatment has led to the development of hysteresis-free devices with an impressive &#8776;13% increase in power conversion efficiency. Computational studies have explored the halide perovskite architecture of ODPA-treated HTL/Perovskite, aiming to unlock superior photovoltaic performance. The ODPA surface functionalization has demonstrated enhanced device performance, characterized by superior charge exchange capacity. Moreover, higher band-to-band recombination in photoluminescence and electroluminescence indicates presence of lower mid-gap energy states, thereby increasing the effective photogenerated carrier density. These findings are expected to promote the utilization of various phosphonic acid-based self-assembly monolayers for surface passivation of oxide-based transport layers in perovskite solar cells. Ultimately, this research contributes to the realization of efficient halide PSCs by harnessing the favorable architecture of NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Interfacial Excited&#8208;State Carrier Dynamics and Efficient Charge Separation in Borophene&#8208;Based Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoexcited carrier dynamics are demonstrated in the heterostructures comprising borophene allotropes and MoS2 layers. The diverse borophenes exhibit distinct and selective carrier transfer behaviors with an ultrafast timescale, enabling efficient charge separation and opening doors to potential applications in optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices.








Abstract
Borophene&#8208;based van der Waals heterostructures have demonstrated enormous potential in the realm of optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices, which has sparked a wide range of interest. However, a thorough understanding of the microscopic excited&#8208;state electronic dynamics at interfaces is lacking, which is essential for determining the macroscopic optoelectronic and photovoltaic performance of borophene&#8208;based devices. In this study, photoexcited carrier dynamics of &#946;12, &#967;3, and &#945;&#900; borophene/MoS2 heterostructures are systematically studied based on time&#8208;domain nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations. Different Schottky contacts are found in borophene/semiconductor heterostructures. The interplay between Schottky barriers, electronic coupling, and the involvement of different phonon modes collectively contribute to the unique carrier dynamics in borophene&#8208;based heterostructures. The diverse borophene allotropes within the heterostructures exhibit distinct and selective carrier transfer behaviors on an ultrafast timescale: electrons tunnel into &#945;&#900; borophene with an ultrafast transfer rate (&#8776;29&#160;fs) in &#945;&#900;/MoS2 heterostructures, whereas &#946;12 borophene only allows holes to migrate with a lifetime of 176&#160;fs. The feature enables efficient charge separation and offers promising avenues for applications in optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices. This study provides insight into the interfacial carrier dynamics in borophene&#8208;based heterostructures, which is helpful in further design of advanced 2D boron&#8208;based optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices.

         <title>Multifunctional Separator Enables High&#8208;Performance Sodium Metal Batteries in Carbonate&#8208;Based Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional separator is designed for sodium metal batteries (SMBs) with the carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte. Thanks to abundant functional groups and solid mechanical strength, the separator can enable high&#8208;performance SMBs with reduced electrolyte volume. Besides, the lightweight, thinness, and high&#8208;utilization electrolyte properties of the separator can further increase mass and volumetric energy densities.








Abstract
Sodium metal has become one of the most promising anodes for next&#8208;generation cheap and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density metal batteries; however, challenges caused by the uncontrollable sodium dendrite growth and fragile solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) restrict their large&#8208;scale practical applications in low&#8208;cost and wide&#8208;voltage&#8208;window carbonate electrolytes. Herein, a novel multifunctional separator with lightweight and high thinness is proposed, assembled by the cobalt&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework nanowires (Co&#8208;NWS), to replace the widely applied thick and heavy glass fiber separator. Benefitting from its abundant sodiophilic functional groups and densely stacked nanowires, Co&#8208;NWS not only exhibits outstanding electrolyte wettability and effectively induces uniform Na+ ion flux as a strong ion redistributor but also favors constructing the robust N,F&#8208;rich SEI layer. Satisfactorily, with 10&#160;&#181;L carbonate electrolyte, a Na|Co&#8208;NWS|Cu half&#8208;cell delivers stable cycling (over 260 cycles) with a high average Coulombic efficiency of 98%, and the symmetric cell shows a long cycle life of more than 500&#160;h. Remarkably, the full cell shows a long&#8208;term life span (over 1500 cycles with 92% capacity retention) at high current density in the carbonate electrolyte. This work opens up a strategy for developing dendrite&#8208;free, low&#8208;cost, and long&#8208;life&#8208;span sodium metal batteries in carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes.

         <title>Activating Tumor&#8208;Selective Liquid Metal Nanomedicine through Galvanic Replacement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic anticancer bioactivity of liquid metal nanodroplets (&lt;30&#160;nm) can be activated via the galvanic replacement reaction with endogenous Cu2+ ions. This chemotherapy strategy, which leverages endogenous nutrients and features tumor&#8208;selective carrier&#8208;to&#8208;drug conversion, dual anticancer pathways (Ga3+ release and Cu2+ depletion), along with abundant reactive oxygen species generation, provides a new tool for synthesizing drugs in biological environments.








Abstract
Advanced chemotherapeutic strategies including prodrug and nanocatalytic medicine have significantly advanced tumor&#8208;selective theranostics, but delicate prodrug screening, tedious synthesis, low degradability/biocompatibility of inorganic components, and unsatisfied reaction activity complicate treatment efficacies. Here, the intrinsic anticancer bioactivity of liquid metal nanodroplets (LMNDs) is explored through galvanic replacement. By utilizing a mechano&#8208;degradable ligand, the resultant size of the aqueous LMND is unexpectedly controlled as small as &#8776;20&#160;nm (LMND20). It is demonstrated that LMND20 presents excellent tumor penetration and biocompatibility and activates tumor&#8208;selective carrier&#8208;to&#8208;drug conversion, synchronously depleting Cu2+ ions and producing Ga3+ ions through galvanic replacement. Together with abundant generation of reactive oxygen species, multiple anticancer pathways lead to selective apoptosis and anti&#8208;angiogenesis of breast cancer cells. Compared to the preclinical/clinical anticancer drugs of tetrathiomolybdate and Ga(NO3)3, LMND20 administration significantly improves the therapeutic efficacy and survival in a BCap&#8208;37 xenograft mouse model, yet without obvious side effects.

         <title>Complete Suppression of Phase Segregation in Mixed&#8208;Halide Perovskite Nanocrystals under Periodic Heating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
When mixed&#8208;halide CsPbBr1.2I1.8 nanocrystals are periodically heated with a temperature change of &#8776;10&#160;&#176;C, the phase&#8208;segregation effect can be completely suppressed even under strong light illumination. The above finding marks the emergence of a practical solution to the detrimental phase&#8208;segregation problem, given that a small temperature modulation is readily available in various fundamental and practical studies of mixed&#8208;halide perovskite nanocrystals.








Abstract
Under continuous light illumination, it is known that localized domains with segregated halide compositions form in semiconducting mixed&#8208;halide perovskites, thus severely limiting their optoelectronic applications due to the negative changes in bandgap energies and charge&#8208;carrier characteristics. Here mixed&#8208;halide perovskite CsPbBr1.2I1.8 nanocrystals are deposited onto an indium tin oxide substrate, whose temperature can be rapidly changed by &#8776;10&#160;&#176;C in a few seconds by applying or removing an external voltage. Such a sudden temperature change induces a temporary transition of CsPbBr1.2I1.8 nanocrystals from the segregated phase to the mixed phase, the latter of which can be permanently maintained when the light illumination is coupled with periodic heating cycles. These findings mark the emergence of a practical solution to the detrimental phase&#8208;segregation problem, given that a small temperature modulation is readily available in various fundamental studies and practical devices of mixed&#8208;halide perovskites.

Here mixed-halide perovskite CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;1.2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;1.8&lt;/sub&gt; nanocrystals are deposited onto an indium tin oxide substrate, whose temperature can be rapidly changed by &#8776;10&#160;&#176;C in a few seconds by applying or removing an external voltage. Such a sudden temperature change induces a temporary transition of CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;1.2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;1.8&lt;/sub&gt; nanocrystals from the segregated phase to the mixed phase, the latter of which can be permanently maintained when the light illumination is coupled with periodic heating cycles. These findings mark the emergence of a practical solution to the detrimental phase-segregation problem, given that a small temperature modulation is readily available in various fundamental studies and practical devices of mixed-halide perovskites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sensitive and Selective Dual&#8208;Mode Responses to Reactive Oxygen Species by Chiral Manganese Dioxide Nanoparticles for Antiaging Skin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral MnO2 NPs are constructed for the quantitative analysis of ROS. The redox reaction between H2O2 and chiral MnO2 NPs lead to decreased signals on CD and T1&#8208;weighted images, thus achieving ultrasensitive and dual&#8208;mode detection of H2O2. Noticeably, in vivo data show that scavenging ROS inhibits skin oxidative damage and prevents skin aging.








Abstract
Excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can lead to oxidative stress and oxidative damage, which is one of the important factors for aging and age&#8208;related diseases. Therefore, real&#8208;time monitoring and the moderate elimination of ROS is extremely important. In this study, a ROS&#8208;responsive circular dichroic (CD) at 553&#160;nm and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dual&#8208;signals chiral manganese oxide (MnO2) nanoparticles (NPs) are designed and synthesized. Both the CD and MRI signals show excellent linear ranges for intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentrations, with limits of detection (LOD) of 0.0027&#160;nmol/106 cells and 0.016&#160;nmol/106 cells, respectively. The lower LOD achieved with CD detection may be attributable to its higher anti&#8208;interference capability from the intracellular matrix. Importantly, ROS&#8208;induced cell aging is intervened by chiral MnO2 NPs via redox reactions with excessive intracellular ROS. In vivo experiments confirm that chiral MnO2 NPs effectively eliminate ROS in skin tissue, reduce oxidative stress levels, and alleviate skin aging. This approach provides a new strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of age&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Suppressing Buried Interface Nonradiative Recombination Losses Toward High&#8208;Efficiency Antimony Triselenide Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, buried interface and heterojunction engineering are synergistically employed to regulate the film growth and optimize the band alignment. Thus, the interfacial trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination loss has been successfully minimized, and heterojunction band alignment has been optimized. Hence, the champion device presents a power conversion efficiency of 9.24%, representing the highest efficiency in sputtered&#8208;derived Sb2Se3 solar cells.








Abstract
Antimony triselenide (Sb2Se3) has possessed excellent optoelectronic properties and has gained interest as a light&#8208;harvesting material for photovoltaic technology over the past several years. However, the severe interfacial and bulk recombination obviously contribute to significant carrier transport loss thus leading to the deterioration of power conversion efficiency (PCE). In this work, buried interface and heterojunction engineering are synergistically employed to regulate the film growth kinetic and optimize the band alignment. Through this approach, the orientation of the precursor films is successfully controlled, promoting the preferred orientational growth of the (hk1) of the Sb2Se3 films. Besides, interfacial trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination loss and heterojunction band alignment are successfully minimized and optimized. As a result, the champion device presents a PCE of 9.24% with short&#8208;circuit density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) of 29.47&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 63.65%, respectively, representing the highest efficiency in sputtered&#8208;derived Sb2Se3 solar cells. This work provides an insightful prescription for fabricating high&#8208;quality Sb2Se3 thin film and enhancing the performance of Sb2Se3 solar cells.

         <title>NIR&#8208;Activatable Heterostructured Nanoadjuvant CoP/NiCoP Executing Lactate Metabolism Interventions for Boosted Photocatalytic Hydrogen Therapy and Photoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NIR&#8208;activated immunomodulatory nanoadjuvant based on the yolk&#8211;shell CoP/NiCoP heterostructure is developed to potentiate photoimmunotherapy through modulating lactic acid (LA) metabolism. Meanwhile, nanotherapeutic platform also has the potential for LA metabolic intervention to improve the effectiveness of Photocatalytic therapy and mild photothermal therapy, providing new insights into more advanced oncotherapy with optimal efficacy, precision, and safety.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser&#8208;induced photoimmunotherapy has aroused great interest due to its intrinsic noninvasiveness and spatiotemporal precision, while immune evasion evoked by lactic acid (LA) accumulation severely limits its clinical outcomes. Although several metabolic interventions have been devoted to ameliorate immunosuppression, intracellular residual LA still remains a potential energy source for oncocyte proliferation. Herein, an immunomodulatory nanoadjuvant based on a yolk&#8211;shell CoP/NiCoP (CNCP) heterostructure loaded with the monocarboxylate transporter 4 inhibitor fluvastatin sodium (Flu) is constructed to concurrently relieve immunosuppression and elicit robust antitumor immunity. Under NIR irradiation, CNCP heterojunctions exhibit superior photothermal performance and photocatalytic production of reactive oxygen species and hydrogen. The continuous heat then facilitates Flu release to restrain LA exudation from tumor cells, whereas cumulative LA can be depleted as a hole scavenger to improve photocatalytic efficiency. Subsequently, potentiated photocatalytic therapy can not only initiate systematic immunoreaction, but also provoke severe mitochondrial dysfunction and disrupt the energy supply for heat shock protein synthesis, in turn realizing mild photothermal therapy. Consequently, LA metabolic remodeling endows an intensive cascade treatment with an optimal safety profile to effectually suppress tumor proliferation and metastasis, which offers a new paradigm for the development of metabolism&#8208;regulated immunotherapy.

Functional electrolytes are prepared by employing the weak&#8208;solvation and low&#8208;viscosity isobutyronitrile as a cosolvents. The as&#8208;prepared electrolyte exhibits a sufficiently high conductivity (1.152 mS cm&#8722;1) at &#8722;70&#160;&#176;C, and enables the LiCoO2//graphite pouch cells to retain 68.7% of the room&#8208;temperature capacity at &#8722;70&#160;&#176;C and present stable cycling performance at &#8722;40 and 60&#160;&#176;C. 








Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) has always posed a significant challenge, limiting their wide application in cold environments. In this work, the high&#8208;performance LIBs working under ultralow&#8208;temperature conditions, which is achieved by employing the weak&#8208;solvation and low&#8208;viscosity isobutyronitrile as a cosolvent to tame the affinity between solvents and lithium ions, is reported. The as&#8208;prepared electrolytes exhibit a sufficiently high conductivity (1.152 mS cm&#8722;1) at &#8722;70&#160;&#176;C. The electrolytes enable LiCoO2 cathode and graphite anode to achieve high Coulombic efficiency of &gt;99.9% during long&#8208;term cycling at room temperature, and to respectively achieve 75.8% and 100.0% of their room&#8208;temperature capacities at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. Even the LiCoO2//graphite pouch cells can retain 68.7% of the room&#8208;temperature capacity when discharged at &#8722;70&#160;&#176;C, and present stable cycling performance at &#8722;40 and 60&#160;&#176;C. This work provides a solution for the development of advanced electrolytes to enable LIBs working at wide&#8208;temperatures range.

Even the LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;//graphite pouch cells can retain 68.7% of the room-temperature capacity when discharged at &#8722;70&#160;&#176;C, and present stable cycling performance at &#8722;40 and 60&#160;&#176;C. This work provides a solution for the development of advanced electrolytes to enable LIBs working at wide-temperatures range.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Manipulating Vertical Phase Separation Enables Pseudoplanar Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells Over 19% Efficiency via Ternary Polymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ternary polymerization strategy is employed to manipulate the vertical phase separation in pseudoplanar heterojunction (PPHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs). The terpolymer DL1, with enhanced solubility, partial edge&#8208;on orientation, and high crystallinity, endows DL1/Y6 PPHJ blend film with the optimized vertical phase separation. Therefore, DL1/Y6 based PPHJ OSCs afford an impressive PCE of 19.10%, which is the record for terpolymer donors.








Abstract
Controlling vertical phase separation of the active layer to enable efficient exciton dissociation and charge carrier transport is crucial to boost power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of pseudoplanar heterojunction (PPHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs). However, how to optimize the vertical phase separation of PPHJ OSCs via molecule design is rarely reported yet. Herein, ternary polymerization strategy is employed to develop a series of polymer donors, DL1&#8208;DL4, and regulate their solubility, molecular aggregation, molecular orientation, and miscibility, thus efficiently manipulating vertical phase separation in PPHJ OSCs. Among them, DL1 not only has enhanced solubility, inhibited molecular aggregation and partial edge&#8208;on orientation to facilitate acceptor molecules, Y6, to permeate into polymer layer and increase donor/acceptor interfaces, but also sustains high crystallinity and appropriate miscibility with Y6 to acquire ordered molecular packing, thus achieving optimized vertical phase separation to well juggle exciton dissociation and charge transport in PPHJ devices. Therefore, DL1/Y6 based PPHJ OSCs gain the best exciton dissociation probability, highest charge carrier mobilities and weakest charge recombination, and thus afford an impressive PCE of 19.10%, which is the record value for terpolymer donors. It demonstrates that ternary polymerization is an efficient method to optimize vertical phase separation in PPHJ OSCs for high PCEs.

         <title>Insulin&#8211;Dendrimer Nanocomplex for Multi&#8208;Day Glucose&#8208;Responsive Therapy in Mice and Swine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An insulin nanocomplex formulation prepared by coupling electrostatic&#8208; and dynamic&#8208;covalent interactions is shown that affords long&#8208;lasting blood glucose control with an elevated insulin response to glucose challenge for up to a week following a single injection.








Abstract
The management of diabetes in a manner offering autonomous insulin therapy responsive to glucose&#8208;directed need, and moreover with a dosing schedule amenable to facile administration, remains an ongoing goal to improve the standard of care. While basal insulins with reduced dosing frequency, even once&#8208;weekly administration, are on the horizon, there is still no approved therapy that offers glucose&#8208;responsive insulin function. Herein, a nanoscale complex combining both electrostatic&#8208; and dynamic&#8208;covalent interactions between a synthetic dendrimer carrier and an insulin analogue modified with a high&#8208;affinity glucose&#8208;binding motif yields an injectable insulin depot affording both glucose&#8208;directed and long&#8208;lasting insulin availability. Following a single injection, it is even possible to control blood glucose for at least one week in diabetic swine subjected to daily oral glucose challenges. Measurements of serum insulin concentration in response to challenge show increases in insulin corresponding to elevated blood glucose levels, an uncommon finding even in preclinical work on glucose&#8208;responsive insulin. Accordingly, the subcutaneous nanocomplex that results from combining electrostatic&#8208; and dynamic&#8208;covalent interactions between a modified insulin and a synthetic dendrimer carrier affords a glucose&#8208;responsive insulin depot for week&#8208;long control following a single routine injection.

         <title>Core&#8211;Shell Perovskite Quantum Dots for Highly Selective Room&#8208;Temperature Spin Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Core&#8211;shell structured perovskite quantum dots with outstanding spin polarization property are developed for room&#8208;temperature spin&#8208;polarized light&#8208;emitting diodes. The 2D chiral organic cation in the shell passivates defects on the quantum dot surface, thereby yielding a high external quantum efficiency of 5.47% and strong circularly polarized electroluminescence with a dissymmetry factor |gCP&#8208;EL| of 2.4 &#215; 10&#8722;1.








Abstract
Circularly polarized light (CPL) is a crucial light source with a wide variety of potential applications such as magnetic recording, and 3D display. Here, core&#8211;shell heterostructured perovskite quantum dots (QDs) for room&#8208;temperature spin&#8208;polarized light&#8208;emitting diodes (spin&#8208;LEDs) are developed. Specifically, a 2D chiral perovskite shell is deposited onto the achiral 3D inorganic perovskite (CsPbBr3) core. Owing to the chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity effect, the spin state of the injected charge carriers is biased when they are transmitted through the 2D chiral shell. The spin&#8208;controlled carriers then radiatively recombine inside the CsPbBr3 emissive core, resulting in CPL emission. It is demonstrated that the (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;1&#8208;(2&#8208;(naphthyl)ethylamine) (R&#8208;/S&#8208;NEA) 2D chiral cations enhance the spin polarization degree due to their strong chiroptical properties. Systematical defect analyses confirm that 2D chiral cations (i.e., R&#8208;/S&#8208;NEA) successfully passivate halide vacancies at the surface of the CsPbBr3 QDs, thereby attaining a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 78%. Moreover, the spin&#8208;LEDs prepared with core&#8211;shell QDs achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency of 5.47% and circularly polarized electroluminescence with a polarization degree (PCP&#8208;EL) of 12% at room temperature. Finally, various patterns fabricated by inkjet printing the core&#8211;shell QDs emit strong CPL, highlighting their potential as an emitter for next&#8208;generation displays.

         <title>Schottky Junction and D&#8211;A1&#8211;A2 System Dual Regulation of Covalent Triazine Frameworks for Highly Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large &#960;&#8208;delocalized and &#960;&#8208;stacked Schottky junction that synergistically knits a rebuilt extended &#960;&#8208;delocalized network of D&#8211;A1&#8211;A2 system (multiple donor or acceptor units) with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) is developed. The catalyst realizes high&#8208;efficient charge separation and transport in both lateral and vertical directions, thus resulting in an outstanding photocatalytic activity and selectivity for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate.








Abstract
Covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) are emerging as a promising molecular platform for photocatalysis. Nevertheless, the construction of highly effective charge transfer pathways in CTFs for oriented delivery of photoexcited electrons to enhance photocatalytic performance remains highly challenging. Herein, a molecular engineering strategy is presented to achieve highly efficient charge separation and transport in both the lateral and vertical directions for solar&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion. Specifically, a large &#960;&#8208;delocalized and &#960;&#8208;stacked Schottky junction (Ru&#8208;Th&#8208;CTF/RGO) that synergistically knits a rebuilt extended &#960;&#8208;delocalized network of the D&#8211;A1&#8211;A2 system (multiple donor or acceptor units, Ru&#8208;Th&#8208;CTF) with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) is developed. It is verified that the single&#8208;site Ru units in Ru&#8208;Th&#8208;CTF/RGO act as effective secondary electron acceptors in the lateral direction for multistage charge separation/transport. Simultaneously, the &#960;&#8208;stacked and covalently bonded graphene is regarded as a hole extraction layer, accelerating the separation/transport of the photogenerated charges in the vertical direction over the Ru&#8208;Th&#8208;CTF/RGO Schottky junction with full use of photogenerated electrons for the reduction reaction. Thus, the obtained photocatalyst has an excellent CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion rate (&#8776;11050 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and selectivity (&#8776;99%), producing a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalyst for the heterogeneous conversion of CO2 to formate without an extra photosensitizer.

Specifically, a large &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-delocalized and &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-stacked Schottky junction (Ru-Th-CTF/RGO) that synergistically knits a rebuilt extended &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-delocalized network of the D&#8211;A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; system (multiple donor or acceptor units, Ru-Th-CTF) with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) is developed. It is verified that the single-site Ru units in Ru-Th-CTF/RGO act as effective secondary electron acceptors in the lateral direction for multistage charge separation/transport. Simultaneously, the &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-stacked and covalently bonded graphene is regarded as a hole extraction layer, accelerating the separation/transport of the photogenerated charges in the vertical direction over the Ru-Th-CTF/RGO Schottky junction with full use of photogenerated electrons for the reduction reaction. Thus, the obtained photocatalyst has an excellent CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-formate conversion rate (&#8776;11050 &#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and selectivity (&#8776;99%), producing a state-of-the-art catalyst for the heterogeneous conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to formate without an extra photosensitizer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Plasma Membrane and Mitochondria Dual&#8208;Targeted NIR&#8208;II AIE Photosensitizer Evoking Synergetic Pyroptosis and Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plasma membrane and mitochondria dual&#8208;targeted photosensitizer (DPITQ) with NIR&#8208;II aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics for evoking synergetic pyroptosis and apoptosis is developed through rational molecular engineering. After encapsulation by DSPE&#8208;mPEG2000, DPITQ presents a clear NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging capability on the venous vessels of nude mice and efficient NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided phototherapy for tumors.








Abstract
Phototherapy provides a noninvasive and spatiotemporal controllable paradigm to inhibit the evasion of the programmed cell death (PCD) of tumors. However, conventional photosensitizers (PSs) often induce a single PCD process, resulting in insufficient photodamage and severely impeding their application scopes. In this study, molecular engineering is conducted by adjusting electron donors to develop an aggregation&#8208;induced NIR&#8208;II emissive PS (DPITQ) for plasma membrane and mitochondria dual&#8208;targeted tumor therapy by evoking synergetic pyroptosis and apoptosis. DPITQ displays boosted type I and II reactive oxygen species generation as well as a high photothermal conversion efficacy (43%) after laser irradiation of 635 nm. The excellent biocompatibility and appropriate lipophilicity help the DPITQ to specifically anchor in the plasma membrane and mitochondria of cancer cells. Furthermore, the photosensitized DPITQ can disrupt the intact plasma membrane and cause mitochondrial dysfunction, ultimately causing concurrent pyroptosis and apoptosis to suppress cancer cell proliferation even under hypoxia. It is noteworthy that the DPITQ nanoparticles (NPs) present clear NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging capability on the venous vessels of nude mice. Notably, the DPITQ NPs exert efficient NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided phototherapy both in multicellular tumor spheroids and in vivo, causing maximum destruction to tumors but minimum adverse effects to normal tissue.

         <title>A Multifunctional Amino Acid Enables Direct Recycling of Spent LiFePO4 Cathode Material</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydroxyl groups and amino groups in L&#8208;threonine act as electron donors and nitrogen sources, respectively. N atoms derived from amino groups are able to dope into carbon layers, generating more active sites and enhancing the conductive properties of LFP particles. Therefore, the regenerated LFP shows excellent cycling performance with 86% retention after 500 cycles at 5 C rate.








Abstract
Lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4, LFP) batteries are extensively used in electric vehicles and energy storage due to their good cycling stability and safety. However, the finite service life of lithium&#8208;ion batteries leads to significant amounts of retired LFP batteries, urgently required to be recycled by environmentally friendly and effective methods. Here, a direct regeneration strategy using natural and low&#8208;cost L&#8208;threonine as a multifunctional reductant is proposed. The hydroxyl groups and amino groups in L&#8208;threonine act as electron donors and nitrogen sources, respectively. The reductive environment created by L&#8208;threonine not only aids in converting the degraded FePO4 phase back to a single LFP phase but also facilitates the elimination of detrimental Li&#8211;Fe anti&#8208;site defects; thus, reconstructing fast Li+ diffusion channels. Meanwhile, N atoms derived from amino groups are able to dope into carbon layers, generating more active sites and enhancing the conductive properties of LFP particles. The regenerated LFP shows great electrochemical performance with a discharge capacity of 147.9 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 C and a capacity retention of 86% after 500 cycles at 5 C. Further, this approach is also feasible for LFP black mass sourced from practical industrial dismantling lines, providing considerable prospects for the large&#8208;scale recycling of LFP batteries.

         <title>Injectable Supramolecular Hydrogels for In Situ Programming of Car&#8208;T Cells toward Solid Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An injectable CAR plasmid (pCAR)&#8208;loaded supramolecular hydrogel system for long&#8208;term and sustained reprogramming of CAR&#8208;T cells in situ for solid tumor immunotherapy is introduced. After injection locally adjacent to a solid tumor, the supramolecular hydrogel platform produces in situ CAR&#8208;T cells by sustaining release of T cell&#8208;targeting nanocomplexes&#8208;carrying pCAR and significantly diminishes the immunosuppressive microenvironment or facilitates the clearance of solid tumors.








Abstract
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)&#8208;T cell immunotherapy is approved in the treatment of hematological malignancies, but remains far from satisfactory&#160;in solid tumor treatment due to inadequate intra&#8208;tumor CAR&#8208;T cell infiltration. Herein, an injectable supramolecular hydrogel system, based on self&#8208;assembly between cationic polymer mPEG&#8208;PCL&#8208;PEI (PPP) conjugated with T cell targeting anti&#8208;CD3e f(ab')2 fragment and &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#945;&#8208;CD), is designed to load plasmid CAR (pCAR) with a T cell specific CD2 promoter, which successfully achieves in situ fabrication and effective accumulation of CAR&#8208;T cells at the tumor site in humanized mice models. More importantly, due to this tumor microenvironment reprogramming, secretion of cellular inflammatory cytokines (interleukin&#8208;2 (IL&#8208;2), tumor necrosis factor&#8208;&#945; (TNF&#8208;&#945;), and interferon&#8208;&#947; (IFN&#8208;&#947;)) or tumor killer protein granzyme B is significantly promoted, which reverses the immunosuppressive microenvironment and significantly enhances the intra&#8208;tumor CAR&#8208;T cells and cytotoxic T cells infiltration. To the best of the current knowledge, this is a pioneer report of using injectable supramolecular hydrogel for in situ reprogramming CAR&#8208;T cells, which might be beneficial for solid tumor CAR&#8208;T immunotherapy.

         <title>Manganese@Albumin Nanocomplex and Its Assembled Nanowire Activate TLR4&#8208;Dependent Signaling Cascades of Macrophages</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trace Mn2+ bound to bovine serum albumin (BSA) to form Mn@BSA nanocomplexes can potentiate pro&#8208;inflammatory responses through TLR4&#8208;mediated signaling cascades. Furthermore, assembly of the resultant Mn@BSA nanocomplexes into larger nanowires enables robust and long&#8208;duration interactions with membrane&#8208;bound TLR4s via phagocytosis, boosting the immunostimulation of macrophages.








Abstract
The immunomodulatory effect of divalent manganese cations (Mn2+), such as activation of the cGAS&#8722;STING pathway or NLRP3 inflammasomes, positions them as adjuvants for cancer immunotherapy. In this study, it is found that trace Mn2+ ions, bound to bovine serum albumin (BSA) to form Mn@BSA nanocomplexes, stimulate pro&#8208;inflammatory responses in human&#8208; or murine&#8208;derived macrophages through TLR4&#8208;mediated signaling cascades. Building on this, the assembly of Mn@BSA nanocomplexes to obtain nanowire structures enables stronger and longer&#8208;lasting immunostimulation of macrophages by regulating phagocytosis. Furthermore, Mn@BSA nanocomplexes and their nanowires efficiently activate peritoneal macrophages, reprogramme tumor&#8208;associated macrophages, and inhibit the growth of melanoma tumors in vivo. They also show better biosafety for potential clinical applications compared to typical TLR4 agonists such as lipopolysaccharides. Accordingly, the findings provide insights into the mechanism of metalloalbumin complexes as potential TLR agonists that activate macrophage polarization and highlight the importance of their nanostructures in regulating macrophage&#8208;mediated innate immunity.

         <title>Hydrophobic Trinuclear Copper Cluster&#8208;Containing Organic Framework for Synergetic Electrocatalytic Synthesis of Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The designed perfluoroalkyl hydrophobic crystalline trinuclear Cu&#8208;containing cluster organic frameworks not only inhibit hydrogen evolution reaction, but also the dynamic reconfiguration of the trinuclear Cu clusters in the F&#8208;Cu3&#8208;OF allows short&#8208;range Cu atoms to activate NO3&#8722; and keto acids at the same time and shows excellent performance in electrocatalytic C&#9472;N coupling to generate a series of amino acids.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic synthesis of amino acids provides a promising green and efficient pathway to manufacture the basic substances of life. Herein, reaction of 2,5&#8208;perfluroalkyl&#8208;terepthalohydrazide and tris(4&#8208;&#181;2&#8208;O&#8208;carboxaldehyde&#8208;pyrazolato&#8208;N, N&#8242;)&#8208;tricopper affords a crystalline trinuclear copper cluster&#8208;containing organic framework, named F&#8208;Cu3&#8208;OF. Incorporation of abundant hydrophobic perfluroalkyl groups inside the channels of F&#8208;Cu3&#8208;OF is revealed to successfully suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction via preventing H+ cation with large polarity from the framework of F&#8208;Cu3&#8208;OF and in turn increasing the adsorption of other substrates with relatively small polarity like NO3&#8722; and keto acids on the active sites. The copper atoms with short distance in the trinuclear copper clusters of F&#8208;Cu3&#8208;OF enable simultaneous activization of NO3&#8722; and keto acids, facilitating the following synergistic and efficient C&#9472;N coupling on the basis of in situ spectroscopic investigations together with theoretical calculation. Combination of these effects leads to efficient electroproduction of various amino acids including glycine, alanine, leucine, valine, and phenylalanine from NO3&#8722; and keto acids with a Faraday efficiency of 42%&#8211;71% and a yield of 187&#8211;957&#160;&#181;mol cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1, representing the thus far best performance. This work shall be helpful for developing economical, eco&#8208;friendly, and high&#8208;efficiency strategy for the production of amino acids and other life substances.

         <title>Unraveling Synergistic Effect of Defects and Piezoelectric Field in Breakthrough Piezo&#8208;Photocatalytic N2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergy of defects and piezoelectric field renders an outstanding piezo&#8208;photocatalytic nitrogen reduction activity of BaTiO3. Oxygen&#8208;vacancies (OVs) can strengthen the piezoelectric polarization of BaTiO3 to promote photogenerated carrier separation, meanwhile the optimized piezoelectric polarization field can also modulate the electronic structure of Ti3+ adjacent to OVs to facilitate the chemisorption, activation and dissociation of N2.








Abstract
Piezo&#8208;photocatalysis is a frontier technology for converting mechanical and solar energies into crucial chemical substances and has emerged as a promising and sustainable strategy for N2 fixation. Here, for the first time, defects and piezoelectric field are synergized to achieve unprecedented piezo&#8208;photocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) activity and their collaborative catalytic mechanism is unraveled over BaTiO3 with tunable oxygen vacancies (OVs). The introduced OVs change the local dipole state to strengthen the piezoelectric polarization of BaTiO3, resulting in a more efficient separation of photogenerated carrier. Ti3+ sites adjacent to OVs promote N2 chemisorption and activation through d&#8211;&#960; back&#8208;donation with the help of the unpaired d&#8208;orbital electron. Furthermore, a piezoelectric polarization field could modulate the electronic structure of Ti3+ to facilitate the activation and dissociation of N2, thereby substantially reducing the reaction barrier of the rate&#8208;limiting step. Benefitting from the synergistic reinforcement mechanism and optimized surface dynamics processes, an exceptional piezo&#8208;photocatalytic NH3 evolution rate of 106.7&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 is delivered by BaTiO3 with moderate OVs, far surpassing that of previously reported piezocatalysts/piezo&#8208;photocatalysts. New perspectives are provided here for the rational design of an efficient piezo&#8208;photocatalytic system for the NRR.

         <title>Laser Synthesis of PtMo Single&#8208;Atom Alloy Electrode for Ultralow Voltage Hydrogen Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The universal laser ablation synthesis strategy of single&#8208;atom alloy (PtMo, RhMo, IrMo, and RuMo) self&#8208;standing electrodes is developed. Attributed to the optimized electron distribution and strong bonding between the Pt single atom and Mo substrate, the self&#8208;standing PtMo single&#8208;atom alloy electrode (Pt&#8208;SA0.056/Mo&#8208;L) possesses the splendid catalytic activity and high&#8208;current&#8208;density stability for hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Maximizing atom&#8208;utilization efficiency and high current stability are crucial for the platinum (Pt)&#8208;based electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, the Pt single&#8208;atom anchored molybdenum (Mo) foil (Pt&#8208;SA/Mo&#8208;L) as a single&#8208;atom alloy electrode is synthesized by the laser ablation strategy. The local thermal effect with fast rising&#8211;cooling rate of laser can achieve the single&#8208;atom distribution of the precious metals (e.g., Pt, Rh, Ir, and Ru) onto the Mo foil. The synthesized self&#8208;standing Pt&#8208;SA/Mo&#8208;L electrode exhibits splendid catalytic activity (31&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and high&#8208;current&#8208;density stability (&#8776;850&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 50 h) for HER in acidic media. The strong coordination of Pt&#8208;Mo bonding in Pt&#8208;SA/Mo&#8208;L is critical for the efficient and stable HER. In addition, the ultralow electrolytic voltage of 0.598&#160;V to afford the current density of 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 is realized by utilization of the anodic molybdenum oxidation instead of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here a universal synthetic strategy of single&#8208;atom alloys (PtMo, RhMo, IrMo, and RuMo) as self&#8208;standing electrodes is provided for ultralow voltage and membrane&#8208;free hydrogen production.

         <title>Silicon&#8208;Lattice&#8208;Matched Boron&#8208;Doped Gallium Phosphide: A Scalable Acousto&#8208;Optic Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study implements the first integrated photonic and acousto&#8208;optic devices in novel thin&#8208;film boron&#8208;doped gallium phosphide, indicating its potential as a highly scalable hybrid photonics platform for integration with color centers in high&#8208;index materials. Optical, acoustic, and materials characterization is performed, revealing both strong intrinsic properties and clear pathways toward improvement.








Abstract
The compact size, scalability, and strongly confined fields in integrated photonic devices enable new functionalities in photonic networking and information processing, both classical and quantum. Gallium phosphide (GaP) is a promising material for active integrated photonics due to its high refractive index, wide bandgap, strong nonlinear properties, and large acousto&#8208;optic figure&#160;of merit. This study demonstrates that silicon&#8208;lattice&#8208;matched boron&#8208;doped GaP (BGaP), grown at the 12&#8208;inch wafer scale, provides similar functionalities as GaP. BGaP optical resonators exhibit intrinsic quality factors exceeding 25,000 and 200,000 at visible and telecom wavelengths, respectively. It further demonstrates the electromechanical generation of low&#8208;loss acoustic waves and an integrated acousto&#8208;optic (AO) modulator. High&#8208;resolution spatial and compositional mapping, combined with ab initio calculations, indicate two candidates for the excess optical loss in the visible band: the silicon&#8208;GaP interface and boron dimers. These results demonstrate the promise of the BGaP material platform for the development of scalable AO technologies at telecom and provide potential pathways toward higher performance at shorter&#160;wavelengths.

         <title>In Situ Regulating Cobalt/Iron Oxide&#8208;Oxyhydroxide Exchange by Dynamic Iron Incorporation for Robust Oxygen Evolution at Large Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An exceptional and stable oxygen&#8208;evolving electrocatalyst is developed from self&#8208;reconstruction of amorphous bimetallic FeOOH/Co(OH)2 microsheet arrays through a mechanical stirring strategy, yielding a current densities of 500 and 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at low overpotentials of 290 and 304&#160;mV. This catalyst rapidly reconstructs into Co1&#8208;xFexOOH species through in situ iron incorporation into CoOOH as confirmed by in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron, Raman spectroscopic studies, and theoretical calculations.








Abstract
The key dilemma for green hydrogen production via electrocatalytic water splitting is the high overpotential required for anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Co/Fe&#8208;based materials show superior catalytic OER activity to noble metal&#8208;based catalysts, but still lag far behind the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Ni/Fe&#8208;based catalysts probably due to undesirable side segregation of FeOOH with poor conductivity and unsatisfied structural durability under large current density. Here, a robust and durable OER catalyst affording current densities of 500 and 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at extremely low overpotentials of 290 and 304&#160;mV in base is reported. This catalyst evolves from amorphous bimetallic FeOOH/Co(OH)2 heterostructure microsheet arrays fabricated by a facile mechanical stirring strategy. Especially, in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman analysis decipher the rapid reconstruction of FeOOH/Co(OH)2 into dynamically stable Co1&#8208;xFexOOH active phase through in situ iron incorporation into CoOOH, which perform as the real active sites accelerating the rate&#8208;determining step supported by density functional theory calculations. By coupling with MoNi4/MoO2 cathode, the self&#8208;assembled alkaline electrolyzer can deliver 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at a low cell voltage of 1.613&#160;V, better than commercial IrO2(+)||Pt/C(&#8208;) and most of reported transition metal&#8208;based electrolyzers. This work provides a feasible strategy for the exploration and design of industrial water&#8208;splitting catalysts for large&#8208;scale green hydrogen production.

         <title>Low&#8208;Cost Hydrogen Production from Alkaline/Seawater over a Single&#8208;Step Synthesis of Mo3Se4&#8208;NiSe Core&#8211;Shell Nanowire Arrays</title>

         <dc:description>
This work reports the synthesis of novel platinum group metal free catalysts, heterostructure of molybdenum selenide&#8208;nickel selenide (Mo3Se4&#8208;NiSe) core&#8211;shell nanowire arrays constructed on nickel foam by single&#8208;step in situ hydrothermal process through optimized shape engineering and structural control technology. The Mo3Se4&#8208;NiSe core&#8211;shell nanowire arrays electrocatalyst shows superior electrocatalytic performance, hydrogen evolution reaction with low overpotential from alkaline/seawater electrolysis, respectively.








Abstract
The rational design and steering of earth&#8208;abundant, efficient, and stable electrocatalysts for hydrogen generation is highly desirable but challenging with catalysts free of platinum group metals (PGMs). Mass production of high&#8208;purity hydrogen fuel from seawater electrolysis presents a transformative technology for sustainable alternatives. Here, a heterostructure of molybdenum selenide&#8208;nickel selenide (Mo3Se4&#8208;NiSe) core&#8211;shell nanowire arrays constructed on nickel foam by a single&#8208;step in situ hydrothermal process is reported. This tiered structure provides improved intrinsic activity and high electrical conductivity for efficient charge transfer and endows excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity in alkaline and natural seawater conditions. The Mo3Se4&#8208;NiSe freestanding electrodes require small overpotentials of 84.4 and 166&#160;mV to reach a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline and natural seawater electrolytes, respectively. It maintains an impressive balance between electrocatalytic activity and stability. Experimental and theoretical calculations reveal that the Mo3Se4&#8208;NiSe interface provides abundant active sites for the HER process, which modulate the binding energies of adsorbed species and decrease the energetic barrier, providing a new route to design state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, PGM&#8208;free catalysts for hydrogen production from alkaline and seawater electrolysis.

         <title>Highly Crystalized Cl&#8208;Doped SnO2 Nanocrystals for Stable Aqueous Dispersion Toward High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly crystallized Cl&#8208;doped SnO2 NCs that can form very stable aqueous dispersion with shelf life up to one year are herein prepared without the need of any stabilizer. The fabricated FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells with the electron transport layers made by such NCs achieve champion efficiency up to &#8776;25% for small cell (0.085 cm2) and &#8776;20% for mini&#8208;module (12.125 cm2).








Abstract
Tin dioxide (SnO2) with high conductivity and low photocatalytic activity has been reported as one of the best candidates for highly efficient electron transport layer (ETL) in perovskite solar cell (PSC). The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art SnO2 layer is achieved by chemical bath deposition with tunable properties, while the commercial SnO2 nanocrystals (NCs) with low tunability still face the necessity of further improvement. Here, a kind of highly crystallized Cl&#8208;doped SnO2 NCs is reported that can form very stable aqueous dispersion with shelf life up to one year without any stabilizer, which can facilitate the fabrication of PSCs with satisfactory performance. Compared to the commercial SnO2 NCs regardless of the extrinsic Cl&#8208;doping conditions, the intrinsic Cl&#8208;doped SnO2 NCs effectively suppress the energy barrier and reduces the trap state density at the buried interface between perovskite and ETL. Consequently, stable PSCs based on such Cl&#8208;doped SnO2 NCs achieve a champion efficiency up to &#8776;25% for small cell (0.085 cm2) and &#8776;20% for mini&#8208;module (12.125 cm2), indicating its potential as a promising candidate for ETL in high&#8208;performance perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Hydrogen Ion Capturing Hydrogel Microspheres for Reversing Inflammaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lactic acid produced in degenerated tissues can activate the NLRP3/Caspase&#8208;1/IL&#8208;1&#946; axis and cause chronic inflammation, finally restricting tissue restoration. The engineered hydrogen ion&#8208;capturing hydrogel microspheres (GMNP) using biomimetic mineralization and microfluidic technologies can block the NLRP3 axis by simultaneously capturing excess hydrogen ions and suppressing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), eventually reconstructing the tissue microenvironment and promoting tissue regeneration.








Abstract
Inflammaging is deeply involved in aging&#8208;related diseases and can be destructive during aging. The maintenance of pH balance in the extracellular microenvironment can alleviate inflammaging and repair aging&#8208;related tissue damage. In this study, the hydrogen ion capturing hydrogel microsphere (GMNP) composed of mineralized transforming growth factor&#8208;&#946; (TGF&#8208;&#946;) and catalase (CAT) nanoparticles is developed via biomimetic mineralization and microfluidic technology for blocking the NLRP3 cascade axis in inflammaging. This GMNP can neutralize the acidic microenvironment by capturing excess hydrogen ions through the calcium carbonate mineralization layer. Then, the subsequent release of encapsulated TGF&#8208;&#946; and CAT can eliminate both endogenous and exogenous stimulus of NLRP3, thus suppressing the excessive activation of inflammaging. In vitro, GMNP can suppress the excessive activation of the TXNIP/NLRP3/IL&#8208;1&#946; cascade axis and enhance extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis in nucleus pulposus cells. In vivo, GMNP becomes a sustainable and stable niche with microspheres as the core to inhibit inflammaging and promote the regeneration of degenerated intervertebral discs. Therefore, this hydrogen ion&#8208;capturing hydrogel microsphere effectively reverses inflammaging by interfering with the excessive activation of NLRP3 in the degenerated tissues.

In this study, the hydrogen ion capturing hydrogel microsphere (GMNP) composed of mineralized transforming growth factor-&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt; (TGF-&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;) and catalase (CAT) nanoparticles is developed via biomimetic mineralization and microfluidic technology for blocking the NLRP3 cascade axis in inflammaging. This GMNP can neutralize the acidic microenvironment by capturing excess hydrogen ions through the calcium carbonate mineralization layer. Then, the subsequent release of encapsulated TGF-&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt; and CAT can eliminate both endogenous and exogenous stimulus of NLRP3, thus suppressing the excessive activation of inflammaging. In vitro, GMNP can suppress the excessive activation of the TXNIP/NLRP3/IL-1&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt; cascade axis and enhance extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis in nucleus pulposus cells. In vivo, GMNP becomes a sustainable and stable niche with microspheres as the core to inhibit inflammaging and promote the regeneration of degenerated intervertebral discs. Therefore, this hydrogen ion-capturing hydrogel microsphere effectively reverses inflammaging by interfering with the excessive activation of NLRP3 in the degenerated tissues.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Acetamide&#8208;Caprolactam Deep Eutectic Solvent&#8208;Based Electrolyte for Stable Zn&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acetamide&#8208;caprolactam deep eutectic solvent&#8208;based electrolyte achieves excellent electrochemical performance by reconstructing the solvation structure of Zn2+, suppressing HER, forming a solid electrolyte interface, and minimizing the formation of undesirable by&#8208;products.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising for grid&#8208;scale energy storage. However, conventional AZIBs face challenges including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), leading to high local pH, and by&#8208;product formation on the anode. Hereby the hydrogen bonds in the aqueous electrolyte are reconstructed by using a deep eutectic co&#8208;solvent (DES) made of acetamide (H&#8208;bond donor) and caprolactam (H&#8208;bond acceptor), which effectively suppresses the reactivity of water and broadens the electrochemical voltage stability window. The coordination between Zn2+ and acetamide&#8208;caprolactam in DES&#8208;based electrolytes produces a unique solvation structure that promotes the preferential growth of Zn crystals along the (002) plane. This will inhibit the formation of Zn dendrites and ensure the uniform deposition of Zn&#8208;ions on the anode surface. In addition, it is found that this DES&#8208;based electrolyte can form a protective membrane on the anode surface, reducing the risks of Zn corrosion. Compared to conventional electrolytes, the DES&#8208;based electrolyte shows a long&#8208;term stable plating/stripping performance with a significantly improved Coulombic efficiency from 78.18% to 98.37%. It is further demonstrated that a Zn||VS2 full&#8208;cell with the DES&#8208;based electrolyte exhibits enhanced stability after 500 cycles with 85.4% capacity retention at 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Quantitative Description of Metal Center Organization and Interactions in Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advancing the design of single&#8208;atom catalysts requires reliable tools for discerning distinct metal center arrangements. This study leverages state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art microscopy, machine learning, and simulations to gain insights into the organization and interactions of metal centers and coordination sites in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbons. The findings highlight the impact of density&#8208; and support&#8208;mediated repulsive interactions in shaping spatial configurations and forming low&#8208;nuclearity species.








Abstract
Ultra&#8208;high&#8208;density single&#8208;atom catalysts (UHD&#8208;SACs) present unique opportunities for harnessing cooperative effects between neighboring metal centers. However, the lack of tools to establish correlations between the density, types, and arrangements of isolated metal atoms and&#160;the support surface properties hinders efforts to engineer advanced material architectures. Here, this work precisely describes the metal center organization in various mono&#8208; and multimetallic UHD&#8209;SACs based on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NC) supports by coupling transmission electron microscopy with tailored machine&#8208;learning methods (released as a user&#8208;friendly web app) and density functional theory simulations. This approach quantifies the non&#8208;negligible presence of multimers with increasing atom density, characterizes the size and shape of these low&#8209;nuclearity clusters, and identifies surface atom density criteria to ensure isolation. Further, it provides previously inaccessible experimental insights into coordination site arrangements in the NC host, uncovering a repulsive interaction that influences the disordered distribution of metal centers in UHD&#8208;SACs. This observation holds in multimetallic systems, where chemically&#8208;specific analysis quantifies the degree of intermixing. These fundamental insights into the materials chemistry of single&#8208;atom catalysts are crucial for designing catalytic systems with superior reactivity.

         <title>Diffusible Capping Layer Enabled Homogeneous Crystallization and Component Distribution of Hybrid Sequential Deposited Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, &#8220;diffusible perovskite capping layer&#8221; strategy is proposed to solve the dilemma of uneven crystallization faced by thermal evaporation and spin&#8208;coating hybrid sequential deposited perovskite, which is by far the most promising way to obtain high efficiency of commercially textured perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells.








Abstract
Nowadays, the development of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite by thermal evaporation and spin&#8208;coating hybrid sequential deposition (HSD) method has special meaning on textured perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. However, the common issues of insufficient reaction caused by blocking of perovskite capping layer are exacerbated in HSD, because evaporated precursors are usually denser with higher crystallinity and the widely used additive&#8208;assisted microstructure is also difficult to access. Here, a facile &#8220;diffusible perovskite capping layer&#8221; (DPCL) strategy to solve this dilemma is presented. With DPCL, crystallization alleviation of perovskite and more diffusion channels of organic salts can be realized simultaneously, contributing to a homogenization process. The resultant perovskite films exhibit complete conversion, uniform crystallization, enhanced quality, and reduced defect, leading to obvious improvements in device efficiency, repeatability, and stability. This work offers a way to promote the development of textured tandems a step further.

Cancer Therapy
In article number 2307817, Junjie Yan, Min Yang, Zhen Gu, and co&#8208;workers discover that the intrinsic anticancer bioactivity of liquid metal nanodroplets (&lt;30 nm) can be activated via the galvanic replacement reaction with endogenous Cu2+ ions. This chemotherapy strategy, which leverages endogenous nutrients and features tumor&#8208;selective carrier&#8208;to&#8208;drug conversion, dual anticancer pathways of Ga3+ release and Cu2+ depletion along with abundant reactive oxygen species generation, provides a new tool for synthesizing drugs in biological environments.

Bioengineering
In article number 2303196, Twan Lammers, Horst Fischer, Fabian Kiessling, and co&#8208;workers establish mesoscopic 3D vascularized tumors in perfusable bioreactors to mimic the onset of metastasis in vitro. The &#8220;High Tide&#8221; cover art exemplifies how a tumor spheroid triggers bioprinted endothelium's angiogenesis, akin to the moon's effect on the sea, resulting in high tides.

Bismuth Oxides
In article number 2306205, Eric D. Wachsman, Kang Taek Lee, and co&#8208;workers report outstandingly conductive and stable bismuth oxides through a rational triple&#8208;doping strategy. The developed bismuth oxides show &#8776;140 times higher conductivity than YSZ for 1000 h at 600 &#176;C. Designed low&#8208;temperature solid oxide electrochemical cells, utilizing the bismuth oxides, exhibit exceptional performances in both fuel cell (2.02 W cm&#8722;2) and electrolysis modes (0.95 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.3 V) at 600 &#176;C.

Insulin&#8211;Dendrimer Nanocomplexes
In article number 2308965, Matthew J. Webber and co&#8208;workers present a new strategy to deliver insulin, from synergistic interactions between the insulin protein and a branched synthetic carrier, achieving nanoscale complex formation upon injection. The complexes are solubilized in response to changes in glucose level in order to correct the symptoms of diabetes in real time, with function lasting for at least a week.

         <title>The Emerging Landscape for Combating Resistance Associated with Energy&#8208;Based Therapies via Nanomedicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energy&#8208;based therapies (ET) based on athermal and thermal ablation provide distinct advantages for cancer therapy, but the therapeutic efficiency is generally limited by the emergence of ET&#8208;associated resistance (ETR). The underlying mechanisms of ETR and representative applications of nanoplatforms applied in mitigating ETR are highlighted in this comprehensive review, aiming to facilitate future clinical translation.








Abstract
Cancer represents a serious disease with significant implications for public health, imposing substantial economic burden and negative societal consequences. Compared to conventional cancer treatments, such as surgery and chemotherapy, energy&#8208;based therapies (ET) based on athermal and thermal ablation provide distinct advantages, including minimally invasive procedures and rapid postoperative recovery. Nevertheless, due to the complex pathophysiology of many solid tumors, the therapeutic effectiveness of ET is often limited. Nanotechnology offers unique opportunities by enabling facile material designs, tunable physicochemical properties, and excellent biocompatibility, thereby further augmenting the outcomes of ET. Numerous nanomaterials have demonstrated the ability to overcome intrinsic therapeutic resistance associated with ET, leading to improved antitumor responses. This comprehensive review systematically summarizes the underlying mechanisms of ET&#8208;associated resistance (ETR) and highlights representative applications of nanoplatforms used to mitigate ETR. Overall, this review emphasizes the recent advances in the field and presents a detailed account of novel nanomaterial designs in combating ETR, along with efforts aimed at facilitating their clinical translation.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing organic transistor to construct healthcare monitoring sensors has been an active field in the last decades. Functionalization on the surface or interfaces of device is of vital importance for achieving highly sensitive and selective sensing performance. This review highlights surface/interface modification strategy and the enhanced sensing performance of three types of organic transistors toward several typical sensors.








Abstract
Organic transistors possess inherent advantages such as flexibility, biocompatibility, customizable chemical structures, solution&#8208;processability, and amplifying capabilities, making them highly promising for portable healthcare sensor applications. Through convenient and diverse modifications at the material and device surfaces or interfaces, organic transistors allow for a wide range of sensor applications spanning from chemical and biological to physical sensing. In this comprehensive review, the surface and interface engineering aspect associated with four types of typical healthcare sensors is focused. The device operation principles and sensing mechanisms are systematically analyzed and highlighted, and particularly surface/interface functionalization strategies that contribute to the enhancement of sensing performance are focused. An outlook and perspective on the critical issues and challenges in the field of healthcare sensing using organic transistors are provided as well.

         <title>Multienzymatic Cascades and Nanomaterial Scaffolding&#8212;A Potential Way Forward for the Efficient Biosynthesis of Novel Chemical Products</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on multienzyme cascades for the biosynthesis of novel compounds and how nanomaterials can potentially improve their efficiency. Recent successes in applying biosynthetic strategies for multi&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot reactions toward novel products of interest are highlighted. Then strategies that look toward exploiting bio/nanomaterials for accessing channeling and other nanoscale phenomena in vitro to improve overall catalytic efficiency are discussed.








Abstract
Synthetic biology is touted as the next industrial revolution as it promises access to greener biocatalytic syntheses to replace many industrial organic chemistries. Here, it is shown to what synthetic biology can offer in the form of multienzyme cascades for the synthesis of the most basic of new materials&#8212;chemicals, including especially designer chemical products and their analogs. Since achieving this is predicated on dramatically expanding the chemical space that enzymes access, such chemistry will probably be undertaken in cell&#8208;free or minimalist formats to overcome the inherent toxicity of non&#8208;natural substrates to living cells. Laying out relevant aspects that need to be considered in the design of multi&#8208;enzymatic cascades for these purposes is begun. Representative multienzymatic cascades are critically reviewed, which have been specifically developed for the synthesis of compounds that have either been made only by traditional organic synthesis along with those cascades utilized for novel compound syntheses. Lastly, an overview of strategies that look toward exploiting bio/nanomaterials for accessing channeling and other nanoscale materials phenomena in vitro to direct novel enzymatic biosynthesis and improve catalytic efficiency is provided. Finally, a perspective on what is needed for this field to develop in the short and long term is presented.

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Based Growth Factor Delivery Platforms: Strategies and Recent Advances</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive review on the progress of hydrogel&#8208;based growth factor delivery systems for biomedical applications and the strategies utilized for growth factor delivery optimization is presented, with an emphasis on the ways the hydrogels facilitate the delivery and improve the therapeutic efficacy of growth factors. The current limitations and future research directions in this field are also discussed.








Abstract
Growth factors play a crucial role in regulating a broad variety of biological processes and are regarded as powerful therapeutic agents in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine in the past decades. However, their application is limited by their short half&#8208;lives and potential side effects in physiological environments. Hydrogels are identified as having the promising potential to prolong the half&#8208;lives of growth factors and mitigate their adverse effects by restricting them within the matrix to reduce their rapid proteolysis, burst release, and unwanted diffusion. This review discusses recent progress in the development of growth factor&#8208;containing hydrogels for various biomedical applications, including wound healing, brain tissue repair, cartilage and bone regeneration, and spinal cord injury repair. In addition, the review introduces strategies for optimizing growth factor release including affinity&#8208;based delivery, carrier&#8208;assisted delivery, stimuli&#8208;responsive delivery, spatial structure&#8208;based delivery, and cellular system&#8208;based delivery. Finally, the review presents current limitations and future research directions for growth factor&#8208;delivering hydrogels.

         <title>Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to C2+ Products in Flow Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CO2 reduction electrolytic cells based on electrolyte flow system (flow cells) have shown great potential for industrial devices. An overview of design and optimization of flow cells for C2+ product is presented with a perspective to achieve their industrial applications in the near future.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction into value&#8208;added fuels and chemicals by renewable electric energy is one of the important strategies to address global energy shortage and carbon emission. Though the classical H&#8208;type electrolytic cell can quickly screen high&#8208;efficiency catalysts, the low current density and limited CO2 mass transfer process essentially impede its industrial applications. The electrolytic cells based on electrolyte flow system (flow cells) have shown great potential for industrial devices, due to higher current density, improved local CO2 concentration, and better mass transfer efficiency. The design and optimization of flow cells are of great significance to further accelerate the industrialization of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). In this review, the progress of flow cells for CO2RR to C2+ products is concerned. Firstly, the main events in the development of the flow cells for CO2RR are outlined. Second, the main design principles of CO2RR to C2+ products, the architectures, and types of flow cells are summarized. Third, the main strategies for optimizing flow cells to generate C2+ products are reviewed in detail, including cathode, anode, ion exchange membrane, and electrolyte. Finally, the preliminary attempts, challenges, and the research prospects of flow cells for industrial CO2RR toward C2+ products are discussed.

         <title>Characterization, Structure, and Reactivity of Hydroxyl Groups on Metal&#8208;Oxide Cluster Nodes of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: Structural Diversity and Keys to Reactivity and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many metal&#8211;organic frameworks consist of nodes such as Zr6O8 connected by organic linkers. Hydroxyl groups are present in various forms on the nodes, characterized by infrared and NMR spectroscopies. They have contrasting reactivities, and many play central roles in catalysis, with terminal hydroxyl groups being among the most reactive.








Abstract
Among the most stable metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are those incorporating nodes that are metal oxide clusters with frames such as Zr6O8. This review is a summary of the structure, bonding, and reactivity of MOF node hydroxyl groups, emphasizing those bonded to nodes containing aluminum and zirconium ions. Hydroxyl groups are often present on these nodes, sometimes balancing the charges of the metal ions. They arise during MOF syntheses in aqueous media or in post&#8208;synthesis treatments. They are identified with infrared and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies and characterized by their reactivities with polar compounds such as alcohols. Terminal OH, paired&#160;&#181;2&#8208;OH, and aqua groups&#160;on nodes are catalytic sites in numerous reactions. Relatively unreactive hydroxyl groups (such as isolated&#160;&#181;2&#8208;OH groups) may replace reactive groups and inhibit catalysis; some node hydroxyl groups (e.g.,&#160;&#181;3&#8208;OH) are mere spectators in catalysis. There are similarities between MOF node hydroxyl groups and those on the surfaces of bulk metal oxides, zeolites, and enzymes, but the comparisons are mostly inexact, and much remains to be understood about MOF node hydroxyl group chemistry. It is posited that understanding and controlling this chemistry will lead to tailored MOFs and improved adsorbents and catalysts.

         <title>Advancements in Achieving High Reversibility of Zinc Anode for Alkaline Zinc&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The poor reversibility of zinc anodes hampers the development of rechargeable alkaline zinc&#8208;based batteries due to dendrite formation, passivation, corrosion, and hydrogen evolution. In this review, optimization strategies including 3D structures, protective layers, alloying, additives, separators, and charge protocols, are suggested and summarized to overcome the challenges associated with Zn anodes and fully unlock their potential in alkaline zinc&#8208;based batteries.








Abstract
Rechargeable alkaline zinc&#8208;based batteries (ZBBs) have attracted extensive research attention due to their advantages of low cost, high specific energy, and high safety. Although the investigation of cathodes for alkaline secondary ZBBs has reached a relatively advanced stage, the exploration of zinc anodes is still in its infancy. Zinc anodes in alkaline electrolytes encounter challenges such as dendrite formation, passivation, corrosion during periods of cell inactivity, and hydrogen evolution during cycling, thereby limiting their rechargeability and storability. Drawing upon the latest research on zinc anodes,&#160;six fundamental strategies that encompass a wide range of aspects are identified and categorized, from electrode modifications and electrolytes to charge protocols. Specifically, these strategies include 3D structures, coatings, alloying, additives, separators, and charge protocols. They serve as an insight summary of the current research progress on zinc anodes. Additionally, the complementary nature of these strategies allows for flexible combinations, enabling further enhancement of the overall performance of zinc anodes. Finally, several future directions for the advancement of practical alkaline Zn anode are proposed. This comprehensive review not only consolidates the existing knowledge but also paves the way for broader research opportunities in the pursuit of high&#8208;performance alkaline zinc anodes.
