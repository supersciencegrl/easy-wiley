         <title>Tailored Design of Mesoporous Metal Organic Framework Single Crystals by Kinetics&#8208;Mediated Micelle Assembly for Efficient Asymmetrical Single&#8208;Atom Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a kinetics&#8208;mediated micelle assembly strategy is established for the controllable synthesis of mesoporous MOFs (MesoMOFs) with diverse compositions and mesophases. The customizable meso&#8208; and micro&#8208;environment enables the creation of a new class of mesoporous asymmetric single&#8208;atom catalysts rich in catalytically accessible CoN3O sites, with enhanced localized electrons around Co center and upshifted d&#8208;band center, for efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).








Abstract
Constructing mesoporous metal organic frameworks (MesoMOFs) with customizable meso&#8208; and micro&#8208;environment is pivotal for asymmetric single&#8208;atom catalysis, yet it is impeded by the strong self&#8208;growth tendency of MOFs. In this work, a novel kinetics&#8208;mediated micelle assembly strategy is introduced to realize the general fabrication of mesoporous zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) single crystals. Spectroscopic characterizations and cryo&#8208;electron cryomicroscopy reveal that the strategic use of water accelerates the MOFs kinetics&#8208;mediated micelle assembly via enhancing ligand deprotonation, which suppresses the MOFs self&#8208;growth, facilitating the cooperative assembly of micelles and MOFs. Furthermore, the water amount can modulate the Flory&#8208;Huggins interaction parameters between the solvents and micelles, thereby precisely controlling the pore architectures from spherical, cylindrical to vesicular. Such versatile synthesis creates a new class of mesoporous asymmetric CoN3O single&#8208;atom catalyst. Synchrotron spectral characterizations and theoretical calculations uncover that this asymmetric geometry localizes more electrons around Co center and upshift the d&#8208;band center, stabilizing O* intermediates and promoting the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Consequently, the asymmetric mesoporous catalyst exhibits a half&#8208;wave potential (0.91&#160;V in alkaline media) and a high power density (185&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) in a zinc&#8208;air battery. This work provides a new approach for designing MesoMOFs for asymmetric single&#8208;atom catalysis.

         <title>Dopamine Dopes the Performance of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) is introduced of dopamine hydrochloride (DACl) on the SnO2 film, whose catechol moiety adheres strongly to the SnO2 surface, while its methylammonium groups template the growth of the perovskite layer. The DACl SAM enhances interfacial contact, boosts power conversion efficiency, promotes uniform film formation, reduces defects, and enhances the long&#8208;term performance of perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
The electron transport layer (ETL) is a crucial component of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) as it greatly influences their photovoltaic performance. Among various currently used ETL materials, SnO&#8322; stands out due to its unique advantages, including low&#8208;temperature fabrication and rapid electron extraction capability and excellent energy match of its conduction band edge with that of the commonly used perovskite formulations. However, the currently employed SnO&#8322; layers contain surface defects, such as hydroxyl groups and oxygen vacancies that impair the desired growth of highly crystalline and defect less perovskite films during solution processing of n&#8208;i&#8208;p type PSCs reducing their power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability. Here, a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) is introduced of dopamine hydrochloride (DACl) on the SnO2 film, whose catechol moiety adheres strongly to the SnO2 surface, while its methylammonium groups template the growth of the perovskite layer. Introducing the dopamine SAM at the interface between the ETL and the perovskite increases substantially the solar&#8208;to&#8208;electric PCE while greatly enhancing the PSC stability. This findings demonstrate the surprising benefits of this well&#8208;known neurotransmitter for the photovoltaic performance of PSCs which this is rationalized here by DFT and ab initio molecular dynamics calculations.

         <title>Over Tenfold Increase in Current Amplification Due to Anisotropic Polymer Chain Alignment in Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How to boost the IDS output of an OECT? Anisotropic polymer alignment along the channel direction enables a 13&#8208;fold increase in IDS. Such channel engineering opens the door to unprecedented signal amplification (here gmL/Wd = 2 580&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 with a PBTTT&#8208;backbone bearing single&#8208;ether side chains), faster ON/OFF switching, and improved stability for the next&#8208;generation bioelectronics.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are central to the development of highly sensitive (bio)sensors, energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic devices, and high&#8208;precision electrophysiological monitoring systems. With growing interest in these strategic electronic devices, a novel PBTTT polymer bearing single&#8208;ether side chains (PBTTT&#8208;8O) in OECTs is investigated. Pristine isotropic non&#8208;aligned OECT performance matches state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art transconductance, highlighting the potential of single ethers for designing high&#8208;performance organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs). Moreover, a 13&#215; enhancement of current output is achieved by anisotropic polymer chain alignment of PBTTT&#8208;8O, opening doors to unprecedented device sensitivity. Compared to pristine ones, aligned OECTs afford a 6&#215; increase in the normalized transconductance (gmL/Wd), reaching an unprecedented 2&#160;580&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1. Such improvement is mainly due to a gain in carrier mobility &#181;, as evidenced by four distinct methods. In addition, aligned OECTs exhibit faster doping front propagation, ON switching, and OFF switching compared to pristine ones. This study hence reports a versatile and easily transferable approach to concomitantly boost signal amplification and accelerate the response time of bioelectronic devices.

         <title>Intensive Widmannst&#228;tten Nanoprecipitates Catalyze SnTe With State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;Art Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intensive lath&#8208;shaped Ag2Te Widmannst&#228;tten nanoprecipitates are in situ generated in SnTe via AgPbSbTe3 alloying, and align with the formation of the parallel type and twin type interfaces. These Widmannst&#228;tten nanoprecipitates effectively scatter phonons to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity, resulting in a significantly enhanced average ZT, more suitable for mid&#8208;temperature applications.








Abstract
Nanoprecipitates play a vital role in designing high&#8208;performance thermoelectric materials, particularly for those with short phonon mean&#8208;free paths. However, their effectiveness in reducing lattice thermal conductivity is hindered by the uncontrollable intensity, poor interfacial coherence, and suboptimal morphology. To address these limitations, AgPbSbTe3 is used to alloy SnTe to form intensive Ag2Te Widmannst&#228;tten nanoprecipitates for obtaining state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art thermoelectric performance. Advanced microscopy characterizations reveal the crystallographic orientation relationships between SnTe and Ag2Te to guide the lath&#8208;shaped morphology of Ag2Te, leading to the formation of the high&#8208;intensity Widmannst&#228;tten nanoprecipitates, which effectively scatter phonons to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity. Togethering the optimized electrical properties through carrier concentration adjustment, band convergence, and the energy filtering effect, a maximum figure of merit ZT of 1.5 at 723 K and an average ZT of 1.1 between 423 and 823 K is achieved in (SnTe)0.80(Ag1.05PbSb0.95Te3)0.20, enabling a single&#8208;leg device and two&#8208;pair module with energy&#8208;conversion efficiency of 7.22% and 4.26% under a temperature difference of 450 K, respectively. The findings highlight the potential of intensive Widmannst&#228;tten nanoprecipitates as effective phonon scattering centers, providing a new pathway to enhance the thermoelectric performance of chalcogenides.

         <title>Revealing the Underlying Role of Li2CO3 in Enhancing Performance of Oxyhalide&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) with oxyhalide electrolytes benefit from residual lithium compounds (RLCs) like Li&#8322;CO&#8323;, which enhance lithium ion mobility and interfacial dynamics. This study reveals untreated Ni&#8208;rich cathodes outperform washed ones, challenging conventional views of RLCs and offering insights to improve ASSB performance.









Abstract
Residual lithium compounds (RLCs) in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) employing Ni&#8208;rich cathode materials (LiNixCoyMnzO2, NCM) are traditionally viewed either as ionically and electronically insulating layers hindering electrochemical performance or as protective buffer layers enhancing cycling stability. In this study, a beneficial role of Li2CO3 in ASSBs featuring an oxyhalide&#8208;based AlOCl&#8208;2LiCl (LAOC) solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) is revealed. ASSBs containing NCM with residual Li2CO3 demonstrate superior electrochemical performance compared to those treated with a washing pretreatment to remove Li2CO3. Solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy shows that Li2CO3 facilitates spontaneous Li+ exchange at multiple sites within the LAOC SSE. This leads to faster ion mobility and shorter relaxation times at various lithium sites, indicating enhanced ion transport and improved interface dynamics. Moreover, the beneficial effects of Li2CO3 are confirmed in other halide&#8208;based ASSBs. This study uncovers an unexpected role for Li2CO3 in halide&#8208;based ASSBs, offering insights that may inspire further exploration of RLCs with functional properties for improving ASSBs performance.

         <title>Quantifying the Effects of Geometric Parameters on the Elastic Properties of Multilayer Graphene Platelet Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Realistic random 3D periodic representative volume element models of multilayer graphene platelet films are constructed to perform simulations, quantify the effects of different geometric parameters on all their five independent elastic properties, and uncover the dominant deformation mechanisms. The obtained dimensionless results apply to different types of laminate or multi&#8208;layered materials such as MXene, graphene oxide films, and nacre and seashells.








Abstract
Multilayer graphene platelet films (MGPFs) are widely studied for their exceptional mechanical, electrical, and chemical properties. The elastic properties and deformation mechanisms of MGPFs are highly sensitive to their geometric parameters, including graphene platelet size, graphene area fraction, and layer count. Despite extensive experimental and theoretical efforts, systematically quantifying these effects remains a significant challenge, severely hindering the design of high&#8208;performance MGPFs. Here, realistic random 3D periodic representative volume element (RVE) models of MGPFs are constructed to perform simulations, quantify the effects of different geometric parameters on all their five independent elastic properties, and uncover the dominant deformation mechanisms. The results reveal that the dimensionless platelet size, graphene area fraction, and number of platelet layers significantly affect the elastic properties, with detailed quantifications provided for their relationships. The effects of defects on the elastic properties are also explored, offering insights into the dominant deformation mechanisms. Validation against experimental data confirms that the developed RVE models and dimensionless results apply to various multilayer laminate composites, including MGPFs, MXene, graphene oxide films, and nacre&#8208;like materials. The findings provide a robust framework and pave the way for optimizing the design of MGPFs and other laminate composites, enabling their potential in diverse applications.

         <title>Vectorial Fluorescence Control with Light&#8208;Emitting Metasurfaces for Unidirectional Emission and Incoherent Holography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The light&#8208;emitting metasurfaces (LEMs) are constructed for unidirectional emission and incoherent photoluminescence (PL) holography. Through engineering the interaction between LEM and guided PL, the diffraction angle, linear polarization state, and emission intensity are independently controlled. Furthermore, the phase encoding capability of LEM experimentally enabled vectorial PL holography alongside nanoprinting. Such LEM potentially paves the way for next&#8208;generation vectorial light&#8208;emitting devices.








Abstract
Ultracompact light emission manipulation is crucial for various applications, including illumination, biosensing, and quantum photonics. Despite significant advancements in lasing manipulation, achieving complex vectorial wavefront control over fluorescence emission is inherently challenging due to its incoherent, omnidirectional, unpolarized, and phase&#8208;random emission characteristics. Here, the light&#8208;emitting metasurfaces (LEMs), equipped with vectorial manipulation and complex amplitude encoding capabilities, are introduced to realize unidirectional emission and incoherent photoluminescence (PL) holography. Through engineering the interaction between the LEM and guided PL, the diffraction angle, linear polarization state, and emission intensity of PL unidirectional emission are independently controlled. Furthermore, the phase encoding capability of LEM, combined with the enhanced spatial coherence of guided PL, experimentally enabled vectorial PL holography alongside polarization&#8208;multiplexed nanoprinting. This versatile LEM platform provides a simplified approach to vectorial PL manipulation, promising multiple potential applications in nanophotonics and light&#8208;emitting devices.

         <title>Heteronanoarchitecture of Ti3C2Tx MXene and Amorphous MOF for Exceptional Durability in Electro&#8208;Ionic Soft Actuator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nanoscale hybridization of MXene and amorphous metal&#8208;organic framework (MXene&#8211;aMOF) achieves exceptional electrochemical stability and ion storage capacity, attributed to the synergistic interplay between the nanoporous surfaces of aMOF and the metal&#8208;like electron conduction of MXene. This enhanced longevity of the MXene&#8208;aMOF electrode enables active morphing surfaces with reconfigurable dimensions and patterns, advancing applications in smart, adaptive materials.








Abstract
The assembly of 2D nanosheets with other functional nanomaterials enables the creation of materials with unique property combinations that cannot be achieved in single&#8208;phase materials. In particular, a combination of inorganic and organic components provides a pathway to structures offering highly durable ionic and electronic conductivity simultaneously. Here, a controlled growth of amorphous metal&#8211;organic framework (aMOF) in the interlayer spaces of Ti3C2Tx MXene for enhancing oxidation stability and accelerating fast ion transport is reported. The hydrophilic terminations of MXene provide support for the continuous growth of iron&#8208;based aMOF in the available interlayer 2D slits. Effective electronic interactions involving hydrogen bonding, coordination, and esterification in&#8208;between the open surfaces of MXene and nanoporous aMOF enhance the electrochemical strength of MXene&#8211;aMOF hybrid electrodes and allow the design of extremely durable electro&#8208;ionic soft actuators. The MXene&#8211;aMOF exhibits a fivefold increment in electroactuation compared to a conventional poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene)&#8208;poly(styrenesulfonate) soft actuator, with robust stability up to 50&#160;000 cycles in open air. Using the MXene&#8211;aMOF soft actuator, a deformable morphing surface with reversibly adjustable shapes and patterns is demonstrated.

         <title>Adhesively Bridging Co&#8208;Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer and Perovskite Via In Situ Polymerization for Enhanced Stability of Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic interface engineering strategy is introduced that combines a co&#8208;assembled monolayer with in situ polymerization to optimize the buried interface of perovskite film. The polymerized layer at the interface enhances interfacial adhesion, regulates perovskite crystallization, and reinforces structural integrity by strongly anchoring organic cations through multiple hydrogen bonds.








Abstract
The strategic utilization of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) significantly advances the interfacial contact and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of inverted perovskite solar cells (IPSCs). However, inadequate adhesion between the SAM and perovskite layer remains a critical challenge, limiting further performance enhancement. Herein, a synergistic interface engineering strategy is introduced that combines a co&#8208;assembly approach with in situ polymerization to optimize the buried interface of perovskite film. Specifically, 11&#8208;Mercaptoundecylphosphoric acid (MPA) is incorporated into a SAM to form co&#8208;SAMs, improving homogeneity and mitigating defects at the NiOx surface. Simultaneously, the ionic liquid (IL) monomer 1&#8208;Allyl&#8208;3&#8208;vinylimidazolium bis((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl) imide (AVMTF2) is incorporated into the perovskite precursor. The aggregation of ILs cation at the bottom interface facilitates in situ polymerization via sulfhydryl end groups, forming the POL&#8208;AVM polymer at the perovskite/SAM interface. This polymer enhances interfacial adhesion, regulates perovskite crystallization, and reinforces structural integrity by strongly anchoring organic cations through multiple hydrogen bonds. As a result, this synergistic strategy achieves a champion PCE of 26.25% (certified 26.04%), along with excellent long&#8208;term stability, retaining 95.6% of its initial efficiency after 1000 h of continuous operation under the ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2I protocol.

     alt="Adhesively Bridging Co-Self-Assembled Monolayer and Perovskite Via In Situ Polymerization for Enhanced Stability of Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A synergistic interface engineering strategy is introduced that combines a co-assembled monolayer with in situ polymerization to optimize the buried interface of perovskite film. The polymerized layer at the interface enhances interfacial adhesion, regulates perovskite crystallization, and reinforces structural integrity by strongly anchoring organic cations through multiple hydrogen bonds.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategic utilization of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) significantly advances the interfacial contact and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of inverted perovskite solar cells (IPSCs). However, inadequate adhesion between the SAM and perovskite layer remains a critical challenge, limiting further performance enhancement. Herein, a synergistic interface engineering strategy is introduced that combines a co-assembly approach with in situ polymerization to optimize the buried interface of perovskite film. Specifically, 11-Mercaptoundecylphosphoric acid (MPA) is incorporated into a SAM to form co-SAMs, improving homogeneity and mitigating defects at the NiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; surface. Simultaneously, the ionic liquid (IL) monomer 1-Allyl-3-vinylimidazolium bis((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl) imide (AVMTF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is incorporated into the perovskite precursor. The aggregation of ILs cation at the bottom interface facilitates in situ polymerization via sulfhydryl end groups, forming the POL-AVM polymer at the perovskite/SAM interface. This polymer enhances interfacial adhesion, regulates perovskite crystallization, and reinforces structural integrity by strongly anchoring organic cations through multiple hydrogen bonds. As a result, this synergistic strategy achieves a champion PCE of 26.25% (certified 26.04%), along with excellent long-term stability, retaining 95.6% of its initial efficiency after 1000 h of continuous operation under the ISOS-L-2I protocol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Liquid Metal&#8208;Vitrimer Conductive Composite for Recyclable and Resilient Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the growing electronic waste challenge, an electrically conductive, healable, and recyclable plastic composite is created, composed of vitrimer and liquid metal microdroplets. A reconfigurable circuit board is demonstrated using this composite material, providing a notable step toward sustainable and robust electronic technologies.








Abstract
Electronic devices are ubiquitous in modern society, yet their poor recycling rates contribute to substantial economic losses and worsening environmental impacts from electronic waste (E&#8208;waste) disposal. Here, recyclable and healable electronics are reported through a vitrimer&#8208;liquid metal (LM) microdroplet composite. These electrically conductive, yet plastic&#8208;like composites display mechanical qualities of rigid thermosets and recyclability through a dynamic covalent polymer network. The composite exhibits a high glass transition temperature, good solvent resistance, high electrical conductivity, and recyclability. The vitrimer synthesis proceeds without the need for a catalyst or a high curing temperature, which enables facile fabrication of the composite materials. The as&#8208;synthesized vitrimer exhibits a fast relaxation time with reconfigurability and shape memory. The electrically conductive composite exhibits high electrical conductivity with LM volume loading as low as 5 vol.%. This enables the fabrication of fully vitrimer&#8208;based circuit boards consisting of sensors and indicator LEDs integrated with LM&#8208;vitrimer conductive wiring. Electrical self&#8208;healing and thermally triggered material healing are further demonstrated with the composites. The vitrimer and LM&#8208;composite provide a pathway toward fully recyclable, mechanically robust, and reconfigurable electronics, thus advancing the field of electronic&#160;materials.

         <title>Infrared Photothermal Catalytic Reduction of Atmospheric CO2 Into CO with 100% Selectivity via Dual&#8208;Plasmon Resonance Conductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Schematic illustration of the designed environmentally friendly CO synthesis route from infrared&#8208;light&#8208;driven reduction of atmospheric CO2 over a dual&#8208;plasmonic photocatalyst, in which the dual&#8208;plasmonic effect helps to improve infrared region absorption and promotes carrier space separation, but also reduces CO2 reaction energy barrier.








Abstract
Today, the fabrication of carbon monoxide (CO) in industry customarily necessitates elevated temperature and pressure. Concurrently, the harnessing of infrared (IR) light, which constitutes &#8776;50% of solar energy, has predominantly remained unexploited due to a pronounced contradiction between the utilization of IR light and CO2 photoreduction. To break the above limitation, a dual&#8208;plasmon resonance conductor with a metallic nature is designed, which realizes the synthesis of CO with 100% selectivity from infrared photothermal catalytic reduction of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Taking the Au particles loaded Cu7Te4 nanowires as an example, the surface dual&#8208;plasmon resonance coupling effect can optimize the three critical processes of CO2 photoreduction, in which it is illustrated that the dual&#8208;plasmon resonance effect lowers the thermodynamic reaction energy barrier, facilitating the selective generation of CO products. Consequently, the Au&#8208;Cu7Te4 nanowires manifest a CO evolution rate of &#8776;2.7&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with 100% selectivity for atmospheric CO2 reduction driven by IR light, several times higher than that of the Cu7Te4 nanowires.

         <title>Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Sulfur Batteries: From Challenges to Strategies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on building better aqueous zinc&#8208;sulfur batteries, including the electrochemistry of conventional and decoupled aqueous zinc&#8208;sulfur batteries, the challenges for the sulfur cathode, zinc anode, and corresponding electrolytes, and the available strategies for the batteries. It will provide guidelines for the modification of electrodes, along with the selection of zinc salts, additives, and co&#8208;solvents.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;S batteries (AZSBs), including conventional and decoupled AZSBs, are suitable options for advanced electrochemical energy storage systems. They are cost&#8208;effective with safety, high theoretical capacity, and power density. Nevertheless, many inherent hurdles need to be overcome to make AZSBs practically feasible, including irreversible transformation of the sulfur cathode, instability of the Zn anode, and incompatibility of the electrolyte. This review presents a comprehensive evaluation of AZSBs, emphasizing the configurations and electrode reactions, challenges, strategies, and prospects for the future. First, the electrochemistry behavior of AZSBs is reviewed, encompassing both conventional and decoupled battery configurations, along with their respective electrode reactions. Second, various sources, hosts, and additives for sulfur are identified that can effectively enhance the reversibility of the sulfur cathode. Third, approaches to constructing the solid electrolyte interphase on the Zn anode and facilitating Zn alloying are discussed as key strategies for anode protection. Fourth, the selection of zinc salts and the employment of organic co&#8208;solvents are explored to regulate electrolytes. Finally, the thoughts on future research development in AZSBs are presented to build better aqueous batteries.

         <title>Molecularly Interlocked Interfaces Enable Record&#8208;Efficiency Stretchable Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual&#8208;phase interface engineering strategy synergizes molecular&#8208;scale topological entanglement with mesoscale gradient modulus transitions, enabling organic solar cells to achieve record&#8208;breaking PCE of 19.58% while maintaining &gt;10% efficiency at 100% strain&#8208;unprecedented in stretchable energy devices.








Abstract
The development of stretchable organic solar cells (s&#8208;OSCs) demands concurrent breakthroughs in mechanical compliance and electronic properties, and the challenge is rooted in the intrinsic mechanical mismatch between organic semiconductors and metal electrodes. Here, this study proposes dual&#8208;phase interface engineering strategies to reconcile these conflicting requirements through molecularly interlocked conductive elastomers. Dynamic stress dissipation through dynamic bond plasticity is achieved by embedding a 3D interpenetrating conducting elastomer network within the electron transport layer (ETL). The strategy creates gradient modulus interfaces through Ag coordination&#8208;enabled nanocomposite bonding, suppressing crack propagation velocities and reduces the interfacial mechanical mismatch phenomenon. Eventually, the PCE of 19.58% is achieved on the small&#8208;area flexible devices, which is one of the highest PCEs for flexible organic solar cells (f&#8208;OSCs) to date. Notably, the stretchable devices retain over the PCE of 10% under 100% tensile strain, surpassing previous stretchable photovoltaic devices. To further validate the potential of this strategy for large&#8208;area module applications, 25 cm2&#8208;based flexible and stretchable modules are prepared with PCEs of 16.74% and 14.48%, respectively. The work redefines material design rules for deformable electronics by establishing a generic mechanically adaptive framework that synchronizes interfacial dynamics across molecular to macroscopic scales.

Redox dyshomeostasis is both a hallmark and a vulnerability of cancer cells, offering multiple avenues for therapeutic intervention. Herein, a belt&#8208;like nano&#8208;heterojunction Cu2O/CuVO3 (CVO) is developed as a potential redox dyshomeostasis inducer by exacerbating ROS levels and compromising antioxidant defense without the need of exogenous stimulations. Steady&#8208;state analysis reveals that CVO exhibits extraordinary reaction velocity and catalytic efficiency (Vmax = 2.32 &#181;m s&#8722;1, Kcat = 0.49 s&#8722;1) in the production of hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH). Likewise, density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the superb charge&#8208;transferring properties in the heterojunction structure and unique surface coverage rate of CVO primarily dominate the high&#8208;efficient catalytic reactions. Noteworthy, CVO is capable of inducing mitochondria dysfunction by aggravating the cellular redox imbalance, thereby triggering multiple cell death pathways and generating synergistic effects. Transcriptomics analysis outcomes further demonstrate that CVO exerts significant and distinct effects on key biological processes in tumor cells, encompassing but not limited to canonical pathways such as apoptosis, ferroptosis, and cuprotosis. Both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate the pronounced tumor&#8208;inhibitory efficacy of CVO, which paves a promising pathway for the development of novel nanocatalysts that effectively target cancer through the amplification of redox dyshomeostasis.

&lt;p&gt;A belt-like heterojunction nanozyme (CVO) with high peroxidase-like activity is facilely developed for inducing apoptosis, ferroptosis, and cuproptosis via redox imbalance in tumors. DFT analysis attributes its catalytic efficiency to charge transfer and OH coverage.

         <title>Light&#8208;Fueled In&#8208;Operando Shape Reconfiguration, Fixation, and Recovery of Magnetically Actuated Microtextured Covalent Adaptable Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalent adaptable network with dynamic disulfide bonds (DS&#8208;CAN) can rearrange its molecular topology through heating or UV irradiation. When combined with ferromagnetic particles, its photoresponsiveness at room temperature enables contactless, spatiotemporal regulation of dynamic bond exchanges during magnetomechanical actuation. This approach enables 3D microfabrication with selective, chemical&#8208;free, reversible shape reconfiguration and fixation in dry conditions without physical contact.








Abstract
Covalent adaptable networks (CANs) enable reprocessability via dynamic bond exchange above their topology freezing transition temperature (Tv) despite chemical crosslinks. However, conventional CANs often exhibit insufficient viscosity reduction upon heating, necessitating extensive application of&#160;heat and pressure through direct contact for processing. In this study, a disulfide&#8208;bonded CAN is introduced to facilitate UV&#8208;assisted processing at room temperature, in addition to conventional thermal processing above Tv. At room temperature, UV irradiation accelerates stress relaxation, mirroring the effect of high&#8208;temperature activation (&gt; Tv = 86&#160;&#176;C) without UV. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation also reveals the underlying mechanism of UV&#8208; and heat&#8208;induced dynamic bond exchange. By incorporating magnetic NdFeB particles, magnetomechanical actuation of CAN/NdFeB microarrays is achieved. Unlike conventional approaches which rely on binders to maintain actuated shapes after removal of magnetic field, this system enables in&#8208;operando UV&#8208;fueled shape reconfiguration and fixation through dynamic bond exchange at room temperature, with reversible recovery of the original architectures on&#8208;demand. Furthermore, photoresponsivity allows for contactless spatiotemporal control over dynamic bond exchanges and resultant microarchitectures via a masking technique. This strategy offers facile, patternable 3D microfabrication and binder&#8208;free homologous shape&#8208;fixation in dry conditions without external pressure.

         <title>Spatially Resolved Observation of Ferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;Paraelectric Phase Transition in a Two&#8208;Dimensional Halide Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Temperature&#8208;dependent nanoscale ferroelectric domain evolution and the ferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;paraelectric phase transition in 2D halide perovskites is visualized using piezoresponse force microscopy. The phase transition initiates locally below the Curie temperature and progressively propagates as paraelectric regions expand. Landau&#8211;Ginzburg&#8211;Devonshire theory identifies a second&#8208;order phase transition, consistent with the gradual evolution of ferroelectric domains.








Abstract
2D halide perovskite ferroelectrics have garnered significant attention due to their potential applications and intriguing fundamental properties. However, their temperature&#8208;dependent ferroelectric behaviors, particularly at the nanoscale, remain poorly understood. In this study, the nanoscale ferroelectric domain evolution with temperature and ferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;paraelectric phase transition in (BA)2(MA)Pb2Br7 films are investigated using piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). Angle&#8208;resolved lateral PFM (LPFM) reveals a complex in&#8208;plane ferroelectric domain structure. Temperature&#8208;dependent LPFM measurements clearly show that the Curie temperature (TC) is &#8776;353 K, as confirmed by other macroscopic measurements. Notably, it is observed that the ferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;paraelectric phase transition initiates locally even below TC. As the temperature increases, large ferroelectric domains fragment into smaller ones and the regions with the novel LPFM phase signal emerge, indicating a local phase transition. Furthermore, temperature&#8208;dependent LPFM spectroscopy demonstrates a progressive weakening of the ferroelectricity. The analysis based on Landau&#8211;Ginzburg&#8211;Devonshire theory identifies a second&#8208;order phase transition, consistent with the gradual evolution of nanoscale ferroelectric domains observed in LPFM images. This spatially resolved observation of phase transition provides critical insights into the temperature&#8208;dependent ferroelectric properties of 2D halide perovskite ferroelectrics and establishes a foundational framework for their future device applications.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Assisted CVD Growth of High&#8208;Quality Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative oxygen&#8208;assisted strategy is proposed to in situ grow twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) with twist angles ranging from 0&#176; to 30&#176;. The fraction of tBLG with small twist angles (0&#176; &lt; &#120579; &#8804; 3&#176;) is significantly improved to 9.15%. The clear moir&#233; superlattice, ultrahigh Hall mobility exceeding 20&#8201;000 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, weak localization effect, and Shubnikov&#8208;de Haas oscillations corroborate the high&#8208;quality of tBLG.








Abstract
Twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) garners significant interest due to its unconventional superconductivity and correlated insulator behavior. However, challenges persist in preparing high&#8208;quality tBLG with clean interfaces and a broad range of twist angles. Herein, a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method is presented that utilizes an oxygen&#8208;assisted strategy to grow high&#8208;quality tBLG with twist angles ranging from 0&#176; to 30&#176;. The continuous and stable oxygen supply not only facilitates rapid graphene growth, but also overcomes the self&#8208;limiting growth of monolayer graphene on liquid Cu. Consequently, the growth rate of tBLG reaches a record of 450&#160;&#181;m&#160;h&#8722;1, with 86.9% of the tBLG grown with the assistance of the oxide substrate. The proportion of tBLG with small twist angles (0&#176; &lt; &#120579; &#8804; 3&#176;) improves to &#8776;9.15%, one of the highest percentages for CVD&#8208;grown tBLG within this range. Density functional theory calculations explain in detail the assisted effect of oxygen on the rapid growth and twist angle distribution of tBLG. Furthermore, the presence of a clear moir&#233; superlattice, ultrahigh Hall mobility of 20&#8201;616 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, weak localization effect, and Shubnikov&#8208;de Haas oscillations corroborate the high&#8208;quality of tBLG. The research offers a new and feasible way of growing tBLG.

         <title>Exploiting Brownian Motion of Plasmonic Nanoparticles Using Optical Printing Approach for on&#8208;Demand Physical Unclonable Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stochastic&#8208;to&#8208;deterministic transformation of the optical printing approach is exploited as a robust and physically grounded entropy source for on&#8208;demand physical unclonable function (PUF) fabrication at mesoscopic scales. The designed ternary PUF consisting of as few as 25 gold nanoparticles provides ample security and high encoding density, demonstrating its feasibility for integration into microelectronic systems.








Abstract
An on&#8208;demand fabrication method for additive physical unclonable functions (PUFs), a hardware&#8208;based security primitive, is inevitably required, especially considering increasingly miniaturized microelectronic devices. An optical printing approach is regarded as an alternative method to fabricate functional nano/microscale patterns against conventional methods due to its superior fabrication flexibility. However, owing to the Brownian motion of nanoparticles, achieving highly precise and selective printing persists an ongoing obstacle for the applicability of optical printing methods. Here, it is shown that the optical printing approach possesses plenty of room to fabricate on&#8208;demand PUFs by exploiting the obstacle from the perspective of randomness. To demonstrate this, an optical PUF based on a mesoscopic lattice pattern consisting of optically printed gold nanoparticles is proposed. Comprehensive analyses on physical features occurring naturally and multi&#8208;modal keys generated from them reveal that both exhibit randomness. Through a ternary bit system and key integration approach, the capability of the physical unclonable function using as few as 25 nanoparticles can be ensured in terms of the amount of information, complexity, uniqueness, and encoding capacity.

     alt="Exploiting Brownian Motion of Plasmonic Nanoparticles Using Optical Printing Approach for on-Demand Physical Unclonable Functions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stochastic-to-deterministic transformation of the optical printing approach is exploited as a robust and physically grounded entropy source for on-demand physical unclonable function (PUF) fabrication at mesoscopic scales. The designed ternary PUF consisting of as few as 25 gold nanoparticles provides ample security and high encoding density, demonstrating its feasibility for integration into microelectronic systems.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An on-demand fabrication method for additive physical unclonable functions (PUFs), a hardware-based security primitive, is inevitably required, especially considering increasingly miniaturized microelectronic devices. An optical printing approach is regarded as an alternative method to fabricate functional nano/microscale patterns against conventional methods due to its superior fabrication flexibility. However, owing to the Brownian motion of nanoparticles, achieving highly precise and selective printing persists an ongoing obstacle for the applicability of optical printing methods. Here, it is shown that the optical printing approach possesses plenty of room to fabricate on-demand PUFs by exploiting the obstacle from the perspective of randomness. To demonstrate this, an optical PUF based on a mesoscopic lattice pattern consisting of optically printed gold nanoparticles is proposed. Comprehensive analyses on physical features occurring naturally and multi-modal keys generated from them reveal that both exhibit randomness. Through a ternary bit system and key integration approach, the capability of the physical unclonable function using as few as 25 nanoparticles can be ensured in terms of the amount of information, complexity, uniqueness, and encoding capacity. The versatility of optical printing regarding the usability of a broad range of substrates and the ability to create arbitrary patterns with tunable dimensions are also shown.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Phototransistor Based on a 2D Polybenzimidazole Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystalline 2D polybenzimidazole polymer (2DPBI), incorporating a porphyrin&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;system linked via 1,3&#8208;diazole units, is synthesized on the water surface over large areas. The 2DPBI thin&#8208;film exhibits high charge carrier mobility (&#8776;240 cm2&#160;V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, measured by terahertz spectroscopy), strong photoresponse, and band&#8208;like transport, enabling phototransistor performance with a detectivity of 2.0 &#215; 1013 Jones, highlighting its potential for high&#8208;performance optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Photodetectors are fundamental components of modern optoelectronics, enabling the conversion of light into electrical signals. The development of high&#8208;performance phototransistors necessitates materials with both high charge carrier mobility and robust photoresponse. However, achieving both in a single material poses challenges due to inherent trade&#8208;offs. Herein, this study introduces a polybenzimidazole&#8208;(1,3&#8208;diazole)&#8208;based 2D polymer (2DPBI), synthesized as few&#8208;layer, crystalline films covering &#8776;28 cm2 on the water surface at room temperature, with large crystalline domain sizes ranging from 110 to 140 &#181;m2. The 2DPBI incorporates a &#960;&#8208;conjugated photoresponsive porphyrin motif through a 1,3&#8208;diazole linkage, exhibiting enhanced &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, a narrow direct band gap of &#8776;1.18&#160;eV, a small reduced electron&#8211;hole effective mass (m* = 0.171&#160;m0), and a very high resonant absorption coefficient of up to 106 cm&#8722;1. Terahertz spectroscopy reveals excellent short&#8208;range charge carrier mobility of &#8776;240 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. Temperature&#8208;dependent photoconductivity measurements and theoretical calculations confirm a band&#8208;like charge transport mechanism. Leveraging these features, 2DPBI&#8208;based phototransistors demonstrate an on/off ratio exceeding 108, photosensitivity of 1.08 &#215; 107, response time of 1.1&#160;ms, and detectivity of 2.0 &#215; 1013 Jones, surpassing previously reported standalone few&#8208;layer 2D materials and are on par with silicon photodetectors. The unique characteristics of 2DPBI make it a promising foundation for future optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Functional Fluid&#8208;Based Soft Robotic Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluidic soft robots offer inherent safety, cost&#8208;efficiency, and adaptability, making them well&#8208;suited for wearable, medical, and bio&#8208;inspired applications. This review introduces functional fluid actuation technologies that convert electrical, magnetic, thermal, chemical, and acoustic energies into fluidic energy without mechanical movable components, enabling more flexible, compact, silent, and untethered soft robotic systems.








Abstract
Soft robots actuated by fluids offer a series of inherent benefits, including safe human&#8211;robot interaction, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and geometry adaptability for manipulating delicate objects, making them highly promising in wearable devices, medical equipment, and bio&#8208;inspired robots, etc. However, the foremost challenge in fluidic actuation lies in developing standardized, universal actuation methods that are flexible, portable, powerful, fast, low&#8208;cost, and safe, rather than still relying on existing rigid pumps and valves originally developed for traditional mechatronic systems. Recent advancements in responsive fluid materials have enabled the emergence of novel functional fluid actuation technologies that convert electrical, magnetic, thermal, chemical, and acoustic energies into fluidic energy without mechanical movable components. These technologies have great potential to provide flexible, portable, and powerful fluidic actuation customized for soft robotics. Here, functional fluid actuation generated from different energies, and their basic principles, structure designs, and robotic applications are introduced. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of different functional fluid actuation are discussed, and their future trends are prospected. It is hoped this review can provide guidance for the development of fluidic actuation technology specifically tailored for soft robotics.

         <title>Controlling Lithium Surface Diffusivity via 2D PtTe2, PdTe2, and NiTe2 Coatings for Anode&#8208;Free and Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium plating mechanisms on 2D&#8208;coated current collectors: PtTe2 coating enables rapid Li surface diffusivity, while PdTe2 and NiTe2 coatings shorten diffusion paths for Li adatoms. In addition, Li2Te, formed from PdTe2 and NiTe2 decomposition, reduces the critical nucleus size by lowering the interfacial energy between the electrolyte and deposited Li.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free Li&#8208;ion batteries (AFLBs) and Li&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) offer superior energy densities compared to conventional Li&#8208;ion batteries with graphite anodes. However, they degrade faster owing to their lower Coulombic efficiency, primarily caused by uneven Li deposition on the current collector (CC) in AFLBs or the Li&#8208;metal anode (LMA) in LMBs. Coating CCs and LMAs has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance the CE. Coating CCs and LMAs with PtTe2, PdTe2, and NiTe2&#8212;metallic 2D transition metal dichalcogenides&#8212;reveals the critical factors for achieving uniform Li plating. The PtTe2 coating facilitates rapid Li surface diffusivity, while the PdTe2 and NiTe2 coatings provide shorter diffusion paths for Li adatoms on the CCs and LMAs. In addition, Li2Te, formed as a byproduct of the decomposition of PdTe2 and NiTe2 during Li plating, reduces the critical nucleus size by minimizing the interfacial energy between the electrolyte and the plated Li. PtTe2 more effectively enhances the AFLB cycling performance, whereas PdTe2 and NiTe2 are more advantageous for LMBs. Notably, a 5&#8208;nm&#8208;thick PdTe2 coating on the LMA achieves 80% capacity retention after 450 cycles using a LiFePO4 cathode (3 mAh cm&#8722;2) at a 0.5 C&#8208;rate.

         <title>All&#8208;Season Thermochromic Window With Customizable Optical Switching Temperature and Directional Thermal Radiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes to achieve the utilization of the &#8220;what you see is what you get&#8221;feature during the synthesis process to customize the preparation of PVP liquid with different LCST for user requirements. Meanwhile, an asymmetrical window (PLA window) for all seasons is designed to achieve warmth in winter and coolness in summer, which has the potential for energy conservation and emission reduction.








Abstract
Dynamic all&#8208;season window is a key energy&#8208;saving solution for maintaining indoor thermal comfort. However, current progress faces challenges in balancing weather adaptability, functional tunability, and fabrication costs. This study introduces an all&#8208;season, polyvinyl propional&#8208;liquid&#8208;based asymmetric window. It features a tunable switching temperature ranging from 10 to 70&#160;&#176;C, maintains transparency at temperatures as low as &#8722;15&#160;&#176;C for extended periods, and delivers optimal net cooling (&#8776;246.5&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2) and heating (&#8776;113.9&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2) power as derived from the modulation of the optical spectrum, and boasts a service life of over 8 years, with resistance to 1000 thermal shock cycles. The synthesis of the polyvinyl propional liquid involves a zero&#8208;emission process, and the transparent&#8208;to&#8208;cloudy phase transition provides a visually identifiable and theoretically predictable indicator for reaction termination. Additionally, the liquid contains an in situ doped dispersant that functions as a cryoprotectant. Encapsulated between an outward&#8208;facing transparent glass layer and an inward&#8208;facing low&#8208;emissivity glazing, the asymmetric window directional scattering of solar radiation and thermal re&#8208;emission, effectively delivers net cooling in summer and heat retention in winter. This window presents a complementary, affordable, and sustainable solution for enhancing energy efficiency and thermal comfort in diverse climatic conditions.

However, current progress faces challenges in balancing weather adaptability, functional tunability, and fabrication costs. This study introduces an all-season, polyvinyl propional-liquid-based asymmetric window. It features a tunable switching temperature ranging from 10 to 70&#160;&#176;C, maintains transparency at temperatures as low as &#8722;15&#160;&#176;C for extended periods, and delivers optimal net cooling (&#8776;246.5&#160;W&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and heating (&#8776;113.9&#160;W&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) power as derived from the modulation of the optical spectrum, and boasts a service life of over 8 years, with resistance to 1000 thermal shock cycles. The synthesis of the polyvinyl propional liquid involves a zero-emission process, and the transparent-to-cloudy phase transition provides a visually identifiable and theoretically predictable indicator for reaction termination. Additionally, the liquid contains an in situ doped dispersant that functions as a cryoprotectant. Encapsulated between an outward-facing transparent glass layer and an inward-facing low-emissivity glazing, the asymmetric window directional scattering of solar radiation and thermal re-emission, effectively delivers net cooling in summer and heat retention in winter. This window presents a complementary, affordable, and sustainable solution for enhancing energy efficiency and thermal comfort in diverse climatic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atomically&#8208;Thin Freestanding Racetrack Memory Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin and flexible freestanding racetrack membranes are fabricated using a water&#8208;soluble Sr3Al2O6 release layer, without a buffer between the release layer and the magnetic heterostructure. The absence of any buffer layer enables local modulation of the current&#8208; and field&#8208;induced manipulation of the racetrack magnetization via direct coupling with patterned platinum underlayers, showing potential for advanced spintronic applications.








Abstract
Advances in freestanding membranes allow novel heterostructures to be formed from distinct families of materials in 2D or 3D configurations. Recently, this technique has been used to form a 3D racetrack memory device by transferring a complex magnetic thin film heterostructure, in the form of a membrane, onto a corrugated surface. The membrane is released using a water&#8208;soluble oxide layer (Sr3Al2O6). The magnetic structure within the membrane is supported by a thin buffer layer (MgO), which decouples the magnetic structure from the receiving surface. Here it is shown that ultrathin freestanding racetrack membranes can be formed without any buffer layer and that the current&#8208;induced motion of magnetic domain walls within the transferred racetrack is highly efficient. Furthermore, the absence of any buffer layer enables local engineering of the racetracks via their direct coupling with pre&#8208;patterned platinum underlayers on which they are placed. The presence or absence of the Pt underlayer allows for local modulation of the current and field&#8208;induced manipulation of the racetrack magnetization. In addition, the ultrathin freestanding membranes exhibit excellent flexibility and enable highly reliable racetrack devices. The findings highlight the potential of freestanding magnetic heterostructure membranes for advanced spintronic applications.

         <title>Efficient Artificial T Cell Therapy for Bacterial&#8208;Colonized Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial T Cells (ATC) for Tumor Colonization: Combining T cell&#8208;derived granzyme B and phage&#8208;derived holin within a disulfide&#8208;linked chitosan&#8208;hyaluronic acid hydrogel framework. ATC targets and destroys tumor cells and intracellular bacteria, enhances immune cell infiltration, and inhibits tumor migration, showcasing potential in precision medicine for effective anti&#8208;tumor immunity.








Abstract
Tumor&#8208;colonizing bacteria can impede the efficacy of cancer treatments and elevate the risk of metastatic spread. While cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are essential for destroying tumor cells, they lack the ability to eliminate bacteria. Here, the artificial T cells (ATC) are presented for tumors, particularly those colonized with intracellular bacteria. The ATC is composed of a hydrogel framework made of disulfide&#8208;linked chitosan and hyaluronic acid, encapsulating T cell&#8208;derived granzyme B and phage&#8208;derived holin. This design leverages the tumor microenvironment for the targeted release of these antitumor and antibacterial agents to precisely kill tumor cells and intracellular bacteria. In vivo studies demonstrate the debris from ATC&#8208;mediated destruction acts as an immune stimulator, promoting immune cell infiltration and inhibiting tumor migration. This work highlights the potential of ATC therapy in achieving targeted treatment and robust anti&#8208;tumor immunity, advancing the field of artificial cell technologies for precision medicine.

         <title>Synergistic Genetic and Chemical Engineering of Probiotics for Enhanced Intestinal Microbiota Regulation and Ulcerative Colitis Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel concept, &#8220;precise regulation of intestinal flora,&#8221; is introduced, integrating genetic and chemical engineering methods to transform probiotics for targeted modulation and effective treatment of UC. This approach, combining engineered bacteria with a polyelectrolyte coating, improves oral bioavailability, inflammation modulation, and flora regulation, offering a safer, more effective treatment option.








Abstract
Live bacterial therapeutics (LBT) hold significant promise for treating ulcerative colitis (UC) by utilizing engineered microorganisms to restore mucosal barrier function, modulate microbiota imbalances, and enhance immunity. However, challenges such as low bacterial survival under harsh gastrointestinal conditions, difficulties in achieving long&#8208;term colonization, and unclear therapeutic targets limit their effectiveness. To address these issues, a novel approach is proposed that integrates genetic and chemical engineering for intestinal flora regulation in UC treatment. This strategy employs bacterial programmability and gene editing to produce bactericidal agents that dynamically modulate the intestinal microecology and utilize controlled chemical modifications to enhance bacterial resistance. Using Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) as a model, a polyelectrolyte composite coating is developed that significantly increased bacterial survival in the gastrointestinal tract&#8212;40&#8208;fold in the stomach and 74&#8208;fold in the small intestine. Additionally, EcN::mcmA is engineered to overproduce iron&#8208;carrier microcins (MccM) with a &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; mechanism to target and disrupt pathogenic bacteria. In a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)&#8208;induced mouse UC model, EcN::mcmA@P/O treatment effectively reduced inflammation and improved intestinal flora regulation, presenting a promising and potentially safer long&#8208;term solution for UC.

         <title>Unique Bioinspired Nanowire Structures for Dual&#8208;Modal Optoelectronic Electronic Skin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An infrared&#8208;electrical (IE) integrated e&#8208;skin with customizable modes is developed by combining interface assembly technique with mechanical strategies. Benefiting from the tunable engineering of nanowire structures, the Mode I demonstrates an ultrasensitive anisotropic IE e&#8208;skin. In contrast, the Mode II delivers an interference&#8208;resistant e&#8208;skin that maintains stable electrical performance and infrared transmittance under complex deformations.








Abstract
As initial basic applications expand into more complex and diverse fields, including prosthesis, the metaverse, and information encryption, the diversification, multifunctionality, and customization of electronic skin (e&#8208;skin) have increasingly become prominent research trends. However, most e&#8208;skins focus on achieving higher performance and a broader response range, lacking functionality and mode customization options. Here, a mode designable bioinspired e&#8208;skin is reported, utilizing a mechanical strategy combined with interface assembly technology, and achieving the integration of optical and electrical sensing capabilities in single functional material. Benefiting from the tunable engineering of nanowire structures, the Mode I demonstrates for the first time an anisotropic infrared&#8208;electrical combined e&#8208;skin, achieving remarkable anisotropic electrical performance with an anisotropy index (GF1/GF2) greater than 104 and stable anisotropy infrared transmittance changes even after 105 cycles at 75% strain. On the other hand, the Mode II offers an interference&#8208;resistant e&#8208;skin that maintains stable electrical performance and infrared transmittance under complex deformations based on novel 3D buckled structure. Finally, the two modes are integrated and successfully applied to the multiple encryption of customized information, presenting significant potential for confidential military projects.

         <title>Interface Engineering p&#8208;n Heterostructured Core&#8211;Shell Mesoporous Particles for Cascade Catalysis Promoted Gas Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by enzyme cascade catalysis and architectural features of living cells, a single&#8208;particle core&#8211;shell cascade catalysis promoted gas sensing platform is delicately designed by positionally assembling n&#8208;type mesoporous CeO2 catalytic shell on p&#8208;type nanocubic CoSnO3 sensitive core, which exhibits a superior sensing performance toward acetone due to the unique catalytic reforming&#8208;oxidation sensing behavior of the well&#8208;engineered CoSnO3@CeO2 heteroconfiguration.








Abstract
Cells have greatly inspired advancements in chemical processes, including leveraging the idea of cascade catalysis to drive thermodynamically unfavorable reactions and mimicking the compartmentalized architecture to design novel nanostructures. Here, a single&#8208;particle cascade catalysis promoted gas sensing platform is inspired to be designed (denoted as CoSnO3@mCeO2) by positionally assembling n&#8208;type mesoporous CeO2 catalytic shell on p&#8208;type CoSnO3 gas sensitive core. Uniform CoSn(OH)6@mCe(OH)x core&#8211;shell particles with tailored mesostructures, tunable large mesopores, and adjustable shell thicknesses are first constructed. After thermal treatment, CoSnO3@mCeO2 particles are obtained, which serve as cascade catalysis enhanced sensitive layer for fabricating gas sensors with independent catalytic and sensing control. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the CoSnO3@mCeO2 gas sensors exhibit nearly three times higher acetone sensitivity (Rg/Ra = 26.81&#8211;50&#160;ppm) than individual CoSnO3 sensors with an ultralow limit of detection of 5.22 ppb. The enhanced sensitivity is achieved through a tandem catalytic reforming&#8208;oxidation sensing procedure, which begins with the primary catalytic reforming of acetone to acetic acid in the mCeO2 shell, followed by the secondary sensing reaction of acetic acid in the CoSnO3 core.

     alt="Interface Engineering p-n Heterostructured Core&#8211;Shell Mesoporous Particles for Cascade Catalysis Promoted Gas Sensing"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by enzyme cascade catalysis and architectural features of living cells, a single-particle core&#8211;shell cascade catalysis promoted gas sensing platform is delicately designed by positionally assembling n-type mesoporous CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalytic shell on p-type nanocubic CoSnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; sensitive core, which exhibits a superior sensing performance toward acetone due to the unique catalytic reforming-oxidation sensing behavior of the well-engineered CoSnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heteroconfiguration.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cells have greatly inspired advancements in chemical processes, including leveraging the idea of cascade catalysis to drive thermodynamically unfavorable reactions and mimicking the compartmentalized architecture to design novel nanostructures. Here, a single-particle cascade catalysis promoted gas sensing platform is inspired to be designed (denoted as CoSnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@mCeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) by positionally assembling n-type mesoporous CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalytic shell on p-type CoSnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; gas sensitive core. Uniform CoSn(OH)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;@mCe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; core&#8211;shell particles with tailored mesostructures, tunable large mesopores, and adjustable shell thicknesses are first constructed. After thermal treatment, CoSnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@mCeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; particles are obtained, which serve as cascade catalysis enhanced sensitive layer for fabricating gas sensors with independent catalytic and sensing control. As a proof-of-concept, the CoSnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@mCeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas sensors exhibit nearly three times higher acetone sensitivity (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; = 26.81&#8211;50&#160;ppm) than individual CoSnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; sensors with an ultralow limit of detection of 5.22 ppb. The enhanced sensitivity is achieved through a tandem catalytic reforming-oxidation sensing procedure, which begins with the primary catalytic reforming of acetone to acetic acid in the mCeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; shell, followed by the secondary sensing reaction of acetic acid in the CoSnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; core. The design concept of cascade catalysis promotes gas sensor can serve as a paradigm for developing single-particle functional nanodevices for various applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sustainable Hard Carbon for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Precursor Design and Scalable Production Roadmaps</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review emphasizes sodium&#8208;ion batteries' potential, highlighting hard carbon anodes, precursor selection by volatility, and sustainable strategies (e.g., bamboo&#8208;based materials) for scalable, high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) emerge as a sustainable and cost&#8208;effective alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to the abundant and widely distributed nature of sodium resources. Hard carbon anodes, characterized by their pseudo&#8208;graphitic layered structures and nanoporosity, are key to achieving high&#8208;performance SIBs. However, the commercialization of hard carbon is hindered by significant challenges in precursor design, carbonization optimization, and sustainability. This review focuses on the critical role of precursor selection and introduces a classification system based on volatile content. High&#8208;volatility biomass precursors, such as bamboo, require pretreatments like acid/alkali leaching or hydrothermal processing to optimize pyrolysis. Medium&#8208;volatility resins and plastics benefit from crosslinking strategies, while low&#8208;volatility materials such as biochar and petroleum coke rely on nanochannel engineering to improve sodium storage performance. Bamboo&#8208;based precursors are highlighted as a promising pathway due to their renewability and environmental advantages, though challenges such as impurity control and structural engineering persist. By integrating precursor design with carbonization strategies, this review provides a comprehensive framework for understanding microstructural regulation and performance enhancement. The insights presented offer valuable guidance for developing scalable and sustainable approaches to produce high&#8208;performance hard carbon materials, paving the way for the next generation of SIB technologies.

         <title>Biocatalytic and Redox&#8208;Regulated Nanoarchitectures for Precision Inflammation and Immune Homeostasis Modulation to Combat Rheumatoid Arthritis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocatalytic and redox&#8208;regulated nanoarchitectures (BEVs@Ru&#8208;HFO) have been constructed for precision inflammation and immune homeostasis modulation to combat rheumatoid arthritis. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of exceptional antioxidase&#8208;like catalytic activities, extracellular vesicles&#8208;mediated inflammation targeting, and ultrasound&#8208;assisted cellular uptake, the BEVs@Ru&#8208;HFO effectively reprograms macrophages, downregulates inflammatory cytokines, and ameliorates hypoxia to inhibit osteoclastogenesis, and ultimately confers bone/cartilage protection and restores joint function.








Abstract
The chronic inflammatory milieu of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), marked by elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS), perpetually activated pro&#8208;inflammatory macrophages (M1) and osteoclasts, and significant infiltration of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines contributes to abnormal articular redox imbalance, severe synovitis, and progressive joint erosion. In this study, the rational design of a biocatalytic and redox&#8208;regulated nanoarchitecture comprising Ru cluster&#8208;anchored hydroxylated Fe2O3 (Ru&#8208;HFO) encapsulated within bone marrow stem cell&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles (BEVs), for precision inflammation modulation to combat RA is proposed. When combined with ultrasound (US) stimulation, this biocatalytic and inflammation&#8208;targeting nanoarchitecture (BEVs@Ru&#8208;HFO) can reprogram macrophages and osteoclasts to restore redox and immune homeostasis, thereby alleviating RA. The findings reveal that the hydroxylation strategy enhances electron density at Ru redox centers and fine&#8208;tunes the binding affinity of oxygen intermediates, thereby ensuring exceptional multi&#8208;enzymatic ROS&#8208;scavenging activities. Notably, under ultrasonic irradiation, BEVs@Ru&#8208;HFO targets inflamed joints, promotes the local accumulation of anti&#8208;inflammatory macrophages, downregulates inflammatory cytokines, and ameliorates the hypoxic microenvironment to inhibit osteoclastogenesis. This ultimately confers bone and cartilage protection and restores joint function. It is posit that this biocatalytic and redox&#8208;regulated nanoarchitecture, with its superior antioxidant and immunomodulatory capabilities, represents a promising strategy for engineering ROS&#8208;catalytic materials to treat RA and potentially many other autoimmune diseases.

A novel three&#8208;terminal PeLET device vertically integrated through a permeable electrode expands additional functionality beyond conventional two&#8208;terminal devices. the specific mechanism is elucidated of E&#8208;field penetration from the integrated capacitor unit to the LED via transient electroluminescence measurements. The PeLET device enables dual&#8208;channel data modulation and on&#8208;device encryption for secure visible light communication.








Abstract
Visible&#8208;light communication (VLC) is a promising technology for alleviating data traffic and spectrum allocation problems. Traditional optoelectronic devices such as light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) are crucial components of VLC systems. However, two&#8208;terminal devices are limited in their functionality and integration capabilities. Thus, a third permeable electrode (PE) is incorporated for high&#8208;efficiency quantum&#8208;dot PE light&#8208;emitting triodes (PeLETs), with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 17.4% and luminance exceeding 29,000 cd m&#8208;2. Then, we elucidate the interplay between the resistor&#8211;capacitor circuit and the charge injection process using transient electroluminescence measurements. The expanded functionalities allow the simultaneous modulation of two input data streams within a single device. The PeLETs enhance data throughput and transmission capacity through dual&#8208;channel communication. Furthermore, on&#8208;device data encryption is achieved using the concept of interference in the data transmission process. Single&#8208;device data modulation using PeLETs provides a novel concept for on&#8208;device data encryption for next&#8208;generation, highly secure VLC systems.

         <title>Interfacial Water on Ag/Ag2S Nanowires Enhancing the Ethanol Selectivity for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfurization optimizes the interfacial water structures on Ag/Ag2S nanowires during CO2 electroreduction, converting CO2 electroreduction selectivity from CO to ethanol with ethanol Faradic efficiency of (FE) 75%. Operando electrochemical surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (EC&#8208;SERS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations identifies interfacial water structures and intermediates including *CH2CHO and *CO, which facilitate ethanol formation. These findings reveal how interfacial water structure optimization via sulfurization enhances ethanol selectivity.








Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of CO2 into multicarbon products represents a pivotal yet challenging target, particularly for metal catalysts that predominantly yield C1 products. Herein, this challenge is addressed through sulfur&#8208;induced electronic modulation of Ag&#8208;based catalysts, steering the CO2 reduction pathway toward ethanol production. By constructing atomically engineered Ag/Ag2S nanowires (NWs) via a controlled sulfurization strategy, a remarkable Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 75% for ethanol at &#8722;0.95&#160;V, along with exceptional stability over 14 h of high&#8208;performance metrics surpassing most reported Ag&#8208;based systems is achieved. Operando electrochemical surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy&#160;(EC&#8208;SERS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations unveil that the Ag/Ag2S heterointerface synergistically regulates interfacial water networks and stabilizes key *CO intermediates, thereby accelerating CO2 activation, proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer, and asymmetric C&#8208;C coupling. Furthermore, sulfurization&#8208;induced dual effects&#8208;optimized hydrogen&#8208;bond interactions and enriched K&#8314; confinement are identified as critical drivers for tailoring the local microenvironment to favor ethanol selectivity. This work not only demonstrates a rational atomic interface design for C2 product orientation but also deciphers the dynamic interplay between catalyst electronic structure and interfacial species, offering a molecular&#8208;level roadmap for advanced CO2 conversion systems.

         <title>Finding a Novel Borate Ferroelectric with Random Domain Structures for Deep&#8208;UV Quasi&#8208;Phase&#8208;Matching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a new room&#8208;temperature borate ferroelectric material, Ba&#8323;Mg&#8323;(BO&#8323;)&#8323;F&#8323; (BMBF) is presented, whose randomly distributed nanoscale domain structures could relax the strict phase&#8208;matching conditions. Benefiting from its unique ferroelectric properties, the BMBF crystal achieves 3.55 &#181;J output energy for 398 &#8594; 199 nm wavelength frequency conversion without requiring birefringent phase&#8208;matching conditions.








Abstract
Finding competitive nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals for practical deep&#8208;ultraviolet (deep&#8208;UV) lasers remains a fundamental yet challenging goal in photonic materials research. The production of deep&#8208;UV lasers through the mesoscopic domain structure of ferroelectric materials has been a popular research area via quasi&#8208;phase&#8208;matching (QPM). However, as of right present, no ferroelectric in the deep&#8208;UV area is able to provide QPM laser output. Here, a new room&#8208;temperature borate ferroelectric Ba3Mg3(BO3)3F3 (BMBF) is presented. The ferroelectricity of BMBF crystals exhibits significant relaxor behavior and the random domain structure can relax the strict phase&#8208;matching conditions, rendering it a disordered NLO medium. Benefiting from its unique ferroelectric properties, BMBF crystal achieves a second&#8208;harmonic generation output energy of 3.55 &#181;J for 398 to 199&#160;nm wavelength frequency conversion, even in the absence of birefringent phase&#8208;matching conditions. This result demonstrates that BMBF is a promising candidate for deep&#8208;UV QPM applications. Furthermore, this study expands the frontiers of borate ferroelectrics while the realization of deep&#8208;UV light output using BMBF crystal motivates and provides a path for its broader application.

         <title>Electrochemical Cell Designs for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Reduction and Water Electrolysis: Status and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses recent innovations in electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions (eCO2RR) and hydrogen evolution reaction cell designs. The latest advancements in in situ cells for operando characterization are also presented. Optimizations in flow patterns, membrane electrode assemblies, electrolyte engineering, and counter&#8208;anodic reactions provide valuable insights into upgrading catalytic systems with enhanced energy efficiency, aiming to support the industrial&#8208;scale implementation of eCO2RR and water electrolysis.








Abstract
Integrating renewable electricity and concentrated CO2 from direct air capture, electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions (eCO2RR) offer a promising pathway for converting CO2 into fuel chemicals, enabling the closure of the carbon loop in a sustainable manner. The clean H2 produced via the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) during water electrolysis can replace traditional fossil fuels without additional CO2 emissions. Achieving large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;efficiency eCO2RR and HER requires the development of rational electrolyzer designs, which are crucial for industrial implementation. This review examines recent innovations in system designs for eCO2RR, HER, and the latest advances in in situ cell designs for operando characterization during electrochemical reactions. It focuses on cell improvements in flow patterns, membrane electrode assemblies, and electrolyte engineering to maximize catalytic activities at the industrial level. Besides, the review discusses optimizing counter&#8208;anodic reactions to improve the energy efficiency of eCO2RR and water electrolysis, offering insights into the design of catalytic systems with efficient energy utilization. Furthermore, it explores the integration of eCO2RR and HER with other electrochemical systems (e.g., fuel cells), highlighting their potential role in the decarbonization of future industrial processes. Finally, the summary, challenge, and outlook on the industrial&#8208;scale eCO2RR and water electrolysis system designs are concluded.

         <title>Neuroblastoma&#8208;Targeting &#960;&#8208;Conjugated COP Nanostructure with Multiple Enzyme&#8208;Mimetic Actions for Sonochemodynamic Immunotherapies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An imide&#8208;linked metal&#8208;phthalocyanine&#8208;based conjugated organic polymer (COP) (COPTPcFe) with a well&#8208;defined &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanostructure and peroxidase&#8208;mimetic atomic Fe&#8208;N sites for sonochemodynamic immunotherapy against neuroblastoma. The COPTPcFe can efficiently produce potent ROS (&#8226;OH and &#8226;O2&#8722;) by utilizing localized H2O2 and the effects of ultrasound, thereby achieving efficient and synergistic tumoricidal activity.








Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has emerged as a promising strategy for neuroblastoma treatment, leveraging ultrasound to induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at tumor sites, thereby enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy. However, a major challenge in SDT is the efficiency of ROS generation, particularly in the context of hypoxia within the tumor microenvironment. Herein, inspired by the natural peroxidase, an imide&#8208;linked metal&#8208;phthalocyanine&#8208;based conjugated organic polymer (COP) (COPTPcFe) has been designed with a well&#8208;defined &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanostructure and peroxidase&#8208;mimetic atomic Fe&#8208;N sites for sonochemodynamic immunotherapy against neuroblastoma. This work demonstrates that COPTPcFe can efficiently produce potent ROS (&#8226;OH and &#8226;O2&#8722;) by utilizing localized H2O2 and the effects of ultrasound, thereby achieving efficient and synergistic tumoricidal activity. Notably, the highly &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure endows COPTPcFe with excellent electron transport capabilities, enabling rapid catalysis of H2O2 to O2, thus alleviating the hypoxic conditions within tumors. Moreover, by encapsulating COPTPcFe with neuroblastoma cell membranes, this study achieveshomologous targeting of tumor cells and tissues, leading to efficient accumulation within tumor cells, mitochondrial disruption, and apoptosis. Additionally, the proposed sonochemodynamic immunotherapy effectively activates natural killer cells and reverses the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, thereby alleviating hypoxia and significantly enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of neuroblastoma treatment.

         <title>Suppressing Interlayer Ion Migration in CsPbX3 Nanocrystal Films for Realizing Efficient and Stable Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A clear CsPbBr3&#8208;CsPbI3 nanocrystal film interface is fabricated through transfer printing to decouple the influence of ion migration inside a single nanocrystal or across nanocrystals along the electric field on the performance of PeLEDs. Halogen ions crossing the nanocrystal film interface cause phase separation and poor device stability, while confined halogen ions in a single nanocrystal negligibly influence the spectral stability.








Abstract
Mixed&#8208;halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) face the critical challenge of field&#8208;dependent phase separation. Discrete colloidal CsPbX3 nanocrystals anchored with ligands are promising to suppress phase separation, yet it remains a mystery how ion migration proceeds when integrated into LEDs as emissive films. Specifically, the influence of ion migration inside a single nanocrystal or across the nanocrystals along the electric field on the performance of PeLEDs needs to be decoupled. Here, a low&#8208;temperature&#8208;assisted transfer&#8208;printing method is developed to construct a model PeLED containing a clear CsPbBr3&#8208;CsPbI3 nanocrystal film interface for tracing the ion migration between perovskite nanocrystal films along the direction of electric fields. The comprehensive study demonstrates that halogen ions crossing the nanocrystal film interface lead to severe phase separation and poor device stability, rather than the horizontal intra&#8208;layer diffusion. The monolayer CsPbX3 nanocrystal film prevents the field&#8208;dependent phase separation caused by interlayer ion migration, significantly improving electroluminescent stability, including spectrum and lifetime. The optimized structure achieves a high external quantum efficiency of 26.9% and a remarkably improved operational half&#8208;lifetime of 61.2 h at an initial luminance of 100 cd m&#8722;2 in pure&#8208;red PeLEDs based on mixed&#8208;halide CsPb(Ix/Br1&#8208;x)3, more than 300 times longer than the control device using multilayer nanocrystals.

         <title>Tuning Surface Coordination Environment of Ni3N by Fluorine Modification for Efficient Methanol Electrooxidation Assisted Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a fluorine&#8208;modified Ni3N electrocatalyst for the efficient methanol oxidation reaction (MOR)&#8208;coupled hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Fluorine tuning enhances surface reconstruction, optimizing activity and stability. The catalyst achieves exceptional bifunctional performance, offering insights into electrocatalyst regulation and surface dynamics in electrochemical oxidation.








Abstract
Replacing the kinetically sluggish oxygen evolution reaction with the thermodynamically favorable methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) represents a promising strategy for energy&#8208;efficient hydrogen production. However, optimizing electrocatalytic performance in the coupled hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and MOR requires precise regulation of the electrochemical coordination environment and a fundamental understanding of activity origins, posing a significant challenge. Here, a scalable strategy is developed that harnesses the high electronegativity of fluorine (F) to tailor the coordination environment of Ni3N, enhancing HER kinetics. Concurrently, adsorbed F&#160;ions induce rapid and extensive self&#8208;reconstruction of the Ni3N surface during MOR by dynamically modulating interfacial ion concentrations (OH&#8315; and Ni species). This reconstruction enhances catalytic activity and enables the selective oxidation of methanol to formate via a sequential pathway, involving primary O&#8208;H bond activation followed by subsequent C&#8208;H bond cleavage at Ni active sites. Consequently, F10&#8208;Ni3N demonstrates exceptional bifunctional performance, delivering 2.02&#160;V and remarkable stability (600&#160;h) for MOR&#8208;coupled hydrogen production in a membrane electrode assembly&#8208;based flow electrolyzer at an industrially relevant current density of 200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. This work establishes a dual&#8208;regulation paradigm for electrocatalysts, offering mechanistic insights into surface reconstruction and a rational design framework for next&#8208;generation energy conversion systems.

         <title>Unleashing the Kinetic Limitation of Co&#8208;Free Li&#8208;Rich Mn&#8208;Based Cathodes via Ionic/Electronic Dual&#8208;Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tetra&#8208;effect integration of Na+/F&#8722; dual&#8208;ion surface doping effectively eliminates the intrinsic kinetic limitations of cobalt&#8208;free lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based cathode materials, maintains highly stable interfaces, and achieves dual benefits in cycling performance and energy density, providing novel insights for the industrialization of cobalt&#8208;free lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based solutions.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based oxide (LRMO) are promising cathode candidates for next&#8208;generation Li&#8208;ion batteries with combined cost&#8208;effectiveness and high specific capacity. Designing Co&#8208;free LRMO can further leverage the low cost of this class of cathodes given the capacity can be maintained. However, implementing cobalt&#8208;free LRMO cathode materials are hampered by their sluggish kinetics, resulting in low capacity and poor rate performance that underperform compared with their Co&#8208;containing counterparts. Here, it is confirmed that the slow kinetics of Co&#8208;free LRMO originates from the structural disorder caused by transition metals (TMs) migration at high voltages (above 4.5&#160;V Vs. Li+/Li) and consequent irreversible oxygen redox process. Aware of this, Na+/F&#8722; is introduced in surficial lattice to alleviate these issues, ultimately achieving improved discharge voltage (&#8776;0.2&#160;V above 1 C, 1 C = 0.25 A g&#8722;1), exceptional cycle stability in pouch&#8208;type cell (95.1% capacity retention in 1 C after 400 cycles at 25&#160;&#176;C, and 80.9% capacity retention after 300 cycles in 0.5 C at 45&#160;&#176;C) and excellent C&#8208;rate performance (&#8776;150&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 5 C). The newly developed Na+/F&#8722; gradient design unleashes the surficial charge transfer kinetics limitation and greatly improves the lattice structure stability, consequently providing valuable guidelines for future high&#8208;capacity LRMO cathode design.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency and High Color Purity Solution&#8208;Processable Deep&#8208;Blue OLEDs Enabled by Linearly Fully Fused Acceptor&#8208;Donor&#8208;Acceptor Molecular Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solution&#8208;processable deep&#8208;blue OLEDs are achieved by designing a linearly fully fused acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type tetraborate emitter with intramoleuclar noncovalent interactions and highly distorted structure, since such emitter promots high color purity satisfying the BT.2020 standard and a fast reverse intersystem crossing rate. The nonsensitized solution&#8208;processed deep&#8208;blue device achieves the best performance among wet LEDs with CIEy &lt; 0.08.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) have attracted much attention from academia and industry because of their advantages such as low production cost and suitability for large&#8208;scale production. However, solution&#8208;processable deep&#8208;blue OLEDs that simultaneously have high efficiencies and satisfy the BT.2020 standard remain still a great challenge. To address this issue, here a tetraboron multiresonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitter, tBO&#8208;4B, embedded with two soluble 2,12&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;5,9&#8208;dioxa&#8208;13b&#8208;boranaphtho[3,2,1&#8208;de]anthracene groups is designed and synthesized with a linearly fully fused acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type molecular structure. tBO&#8208;4B not only achieves an ultranarrow full width at half maximum of 12&#160;nm but also has a negligibly small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap and large spin&#8210;orbit coupling, eventually leading to very fast reverse intersystem crossing rate (4.23 &#215; 106 s&#8722;1). The sensitizer&#8208;free solution&#8208;processed OLED exploiting tBO&#8208;4B as the emitter achieves an ultrahigh maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 30.3%, with Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.147, 0.042) meeting the BT.2020 blue standard. In addition, the corresponding sensitizer&#8208;free vacuum&#8208;processed deep&#8208;blue devices also exhibit an impressive EQEmax of 39.6% and mild efficiency roll&#8208;off with CIE coordinates of (0.147, 0.043). This work will facilitate the development of high&#8208;efficiency ultrapure deep&#8208;blue MR&#8208;TADF materials for solution&#8208; and vacuum&#8208;processed OLEDs.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Directed Growth of Tin Perovskite for Efficient Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tin perovskites suffer from uncontrolled crystallization, leading to high defect density and poor LED performance. A substrate modification strategy is introduced to regulate interfacial nucleation rates and growth directions, effectively reducing defect density and improving film quality. This approach boosts photoluminescence quantum efficiency to &#8776;41% and achieves a record&#8208;breaking external quantum efficiency of 12.8% for tin perovskite NIR LEDs.








Abstract
Controlling the crystallization dynamics of solution&#8208;processed tin perovskites remains pivotal yet challenging for achieving high&#8208;performance lead&#8208;free optoelectronic devices. Herein, it is demonstrated that substrate&#8208;regulated interfacial nucleation governs crystal growth orientation and film quality of tin perovskites. The results show that pristine PEDOT:PSS substrates induce bottom&#8208;interface&#8208;dominated nucleation via strong PEDOT+&#8208;[SnI3]nn&#8722; interactions, driving rapid upward crystallization of tin perovskites and yielding rough films with low photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE: &#8776;26%). Strategic substrate modification with potassium citrate (PC) weakens the PEDOT+&#8208;[SnI3]nn&#8722; interactions, thereby redirecting nucleation initiation to the top interface during solvent evaporation. This results in controlled downward crystallization of tin perovskites, forming smooth films with improved crystallinity and superior optoelectronic properties (PLQE: &#8776;41%). The optimized tin perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) achieve record&#8208;breaking performance with an external quantum efficiency of 12.8% and a maximum radiance of 190&#160;W&#160;sr&#8722;1&#160;m&#8722;2, which is the highest performance reported for tin perovskite near&#8208;infrared LEDs to date. This work demonstrates interface&#8208;directed crystallization control as an effective strategy for achieving high&#8208;performance tin perovskite optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Influence of Ion Size on Structure and Redox Chemistry in Na&#8208;Rich and Li&#8208;Rich Disordered Rocksalt Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The larger ion size of Na+ versus with Li+ has a pronounced impact on the intercalation chemistry of disordered rocksalt cathode materials. On charge, the disordered rocksalt structure is retained in Li2MnO2F but it is lost in Na2MnO2F resulting in extensive amorphization. The larger ion size also lowers the average voltage enabling higher capacities between equivalent voltage limits.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich disordered rocksalts are promising next&#8208;generation cathode materials for Li&#8208;ion batteries. Recent reports have shown it is also possible to obtain Na&#8208;rich disordered rocksalts, however, it is currently poorly understood how the knowledge of the structural and redox chemistry translates from the Li&#8208;rich to the Na&#8208;rich analogs. Here, the properties of Li2MnO2F and Na2MnO2F are compared, which have different ion sizes (Li+ = 0.76 vs Na+ = 1.02 &#197;) but the same disordered rocksalt structure and stoichiometry. It is found that Na2MnO2F exhibits lower voltage Mn&#8208; and O&#8208;redox couples, opening access to a wider compositional range within the same voltage limits. Furthermore, the intercalation mechanism switches from predominantly single&#8208;phase solid solution behavior in Li2MnO2F to a two&#8208;phase transition in Na2MnO2F, accompanied by a greater decrease in the average Mn&#9472;O/F bond length. Li2MnO2F retains its long&#8208;range disordered rocksalt structure throughout the first cycle. In contrast, Na2MnO2F becomes completely amorphous during charge and develops a local structure characteristic of a post&#8208;spinel. This amorphization is partially reversible on discharge. The results show how the ion intercalation behavior of disordered rocksalts differs dramatically when changing from Li&#8208; to Na&#8208;ions and offers routes to control the electrochemical properties of these high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathodes.

         <title>Dual Strategy of Ca2+ Influx and Collagen Denaturation to Remodel the Extracellular Matrix and Amplify Sonopiezoelectric Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The narrow bandgap of noncentrosymmetric Cu3BiS3 nanospheres facilitates charge&#8208;carrier separation under ultrasound irradiation, resulting in a favorable sonopiezoelectric response and reactive oxygen generation. External stimulation causes mitochondrial dysfunction and amplifies cellular oxidative damage. Ca2+ influx and collagen denaturation induced by the piezoelectric signal and photothermal effect facilitated extracellular matrix remodeling.








Abstract
Extracellular matrix (ECM), a core member of tumor microenvironment, is &#8776;1.5&#8208;fold harder than the surrounding normal tissues. Regulating the stiffness of ECM can significantly impact physiological activities of tumor cells, such as growth, differentiation, and migration. Herein, a sonopiezoelectric&#8208;response nanoplatform consisting of Cu3BiS3 nanospheres (CBS NSs) is constructed for ECM remodeling. Sonopiezoelectric therapy (SPT) and chemodynamic therapy (CDT) are conducted using ultrasound (US) and near&#8208;infrared irradiation. Under US irradiation, the mechanical strain of CBS NSs causes piezoelectric polarization and promotes a redox reaction through energy band bending. The built&#8208;in electric field generated by US irradiation amplifies the efficiency of the Fenton&#8208;like reaction and substantially enhances reactive oxygen species production. Moreover, piezoelectric property&#8208;mediated electrical signals can allow Ca2+ influx, upregulating the levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)&#8208;2 and MMP&#8208;9. Integrating US irradiation with near&#8208;infrared irradiation generates localized heat, which can effectively denature tumor collagen, reduce tumor stiffness, and enhance the permeability of CBS NSs into solid tumors, thus improving the SPT effect. The combination of MMP upregulation and collagen degradation can maximize the benefits of ECM remodeling and synergistically enhance the cancer therapeutic efficacy of SPT/CDT. This SPT/CDT synergistic therapy and ECM remodeling platform is an innovative strategy for cancer therapy.

         <title>Metal Halide Perovskite&#8208;Gated Organic Phototransistors for Efficient UV/DUV Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite&#8208;gated phototransistors (PGPTs) using wide&#8208;bandgap metal halide perovskites (MHPs) as dual&#8208;function dielectric and photoresponsive layers are introduced. By decoupling photoresponse and charge transport, the PGPTs achieve exceptional UV/DUV detection performance at low operating voltages, with scalability and material flexibility. This innovative approach offers a cost&#8208;effective, versatile platform for advanced photodetectors, enabling applications in telecommunications, imaging, and solar&#8208;blind detection.








Abstract
Conventional UV/DUV phototransistors, which rely on wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductor channels, encounter issues with material availability, processing complexity, and performance tunability. Perovskite&#8208;gated phototransistors (PGPTs) are introduced that decouple photoresponse and charge transport by using wide&#8208;bandgap metal halide perovskites (MHPs) as dielectric layers and non&#8208;wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductors as channels. This design offers material flexibility, simplified processing, and enhanced performance. Using the 2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper perovskite PEA2PbBr4 (Eg&#160;=&#160;3.0&#160;eV) as the dielectric layer and the organic semiconductor (OSC) P3HT as the channel layer, UV phototransistors are successfully achieved with exceptional photodetection performance at operating voltages below 2&#160;V, exhibiting a responsivity of 1960&#160;mA&#160;W&#8722;1, a specific detectivity of 3&#160; &#215; &#160;1011 Jones, and a response time of &#8776;20&#160;ms. Fabricated via low&#8208;temperature (&#8804;100 &#176;C) solution processing, this approach facilitates scalable production and is adaptable to various OSCs and other wide&#8208;bandgap MHP dielectrics, such as PEA2PbCl4 (Eg&#160;=&#160;3.6&#160;eV) and PEA2SnI4 (Eg&#160;=&#160;3.8&#160;eV), extending their potential for DUV detection. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, an optical decoder for telecommunications is demonstrated using DUV PEA2PbCl4/PDVT&#8208;10 PGPTs, which are immune to ambient light interference. Additionally, these DUV phototransistors show potential for latent fingerprint detection due to their sensitivity to skin absorption characteristics.

         <title>Self&#8208;Replenishable Metabolically Augmented Synbiotic Microspheres Remodel Gut&#8208;Bone Homeostasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a self&#8208;replenishable metabolically augmented synbiotic microsphere (SMASM) is fabricated via thiol&#8211;ene click reaction to restore gut&#8208;bone homeostasis, by employing Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG as a viable metabolic niche and hyaluronic acid as a self&#8208;replenishable prebiotic substrate. Oral administration of SMASMs improves intestinal barrier integrity, mitigates inflammation, and suppresses bone loss in ovariectomized mice, accompanied by alterations in microbial biomarkers and predicted metabolic functions.

Gut microbiota dysbiosis in postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) is frequently accompanied by aberrant metabolism and absorption of short&#8208;chain fatty acids (SCFAs). However, current oral probiotic therapies neglect the crucial role of probiotic&#8208;driven SCFAs metabolism in restoring gut&#8208;bone homeostasis. In this study, commencing with the sequencing of fecal samples from clinical patients with PMO, a self&#8208;replenishable metabolically augmented synbiotic microsphere (SMASM) is fabricated via a thiol&#8211;ene click reaction to restore gut&#8208;bone homeostasis using Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) as a viable metabolic niche and hyaluronic acid (HA) as a self&#8208;replenishable prebiotic substrate. In vitro, the SMASMs exhibit favorable biocompatibility, enhanced resistance to gastric acid, and improved mucosal adhesion for colonization. In vivo, oral administration of SMASMs in ovariectomized mice improves intestinal barrier integrity, mitigates inflammation, and suppresses bone loss, accompanied by alterations in microbial biomarkers and predicted metabolic functions. Notably, HA serves as a sustainable prebiotic substrate that supports the LGG metabolic niche and microbial homeostasis, enhances the production of SCFAs, including butyric, isobutyric, and valeric acids, and contributes to the downregulation of key osteoclastic signaling factors. Importantly, this strategy of oral SMASMs through in situ fermentation offers novel insights into addressing metabolic disorders associated with gut microbiota via the gut&#8211;X axis.

This work reports a compact, high&#8208;performance, solution&#8208;processed flexible organic spectrometer featuring an optical cascade architecture that integrates organic electrochromic devices and photodetectors.

Abstract
Spectrometers are indispensable tools for civil and military&#8208;related optoelectronic applications. To meet the requirements of the revolutionary data/AI&#8208;driven era, next&#8208;generation spectrometers must not only be flexible with minimal sizes but exhibit high accuracy and resolution. In this study, a compact, high&#8208;performance, and flexible organic spectrometer is reported, fabricated using solution processing, which employs an optical cascade architecture by integrating organic electrochromic devices and photodetectors. This organic spectrometer can not only achieve a resolution of 0.56&#160;nm, an accuracy of 0.14&#160;nm, and a broad detection range from 400 to 1000&#160;nm but also realize a vital absolute spectral irradiance measurement ranging from 10&#8722;8 to 10&#8722;4&#160;W cm&#8722;2 nm&#8722;1. Additionally, its intrinsic flexibility and highly replaceable feasibility of bandgap&#8208;tunable organic materials enable their high applicability with excellent portability and adaptability in the upcoming data/AI&#8208;driven era or scenarios.

         <title>Active Passivation Charge Transport in n&#8208;i&#8208;p Perovskite Solar Cells Approaching 26% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a synergistic interface engineering strategy for n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells, integrating active passivation and stacked charge transport. A multifunctional SDBA modifier passivates oxygen vacancies in TiO2 and promotes high&#8208;quality SnO2 deposition, optimizing energy level alignment and carrier dynamics. The resulting devices achieve a record PCE of 25.94% with excellent stability and scalability.








Abstract
In n&#8208;i&#8208;p planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the electron transport layer (ETL) and the hole transporting layer play a crucial role in realizing high power conversion efficiency (PCE). Herein, a TiO2&#8208;SDBA&#8208;SnO2 stacked ETL is reported, where 4,4&#8242;&#8208;sulfonyldibenzoic acid (SDBA) serves as an active passivation agent to suppress charge recombination and enhance interface quality. SDBA effectively passivates oxygen vacancies in sputtered TiO2, while simultaneously promoting SnO2 nucleation and improving film quality. Moreover, its molecular structure increases the surface free energy of the ETL, facilitating the formation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films with larger grain sizes and fewer defects. As a result, PSCs with this optimized ETL achieve a PCE of 25.94% with excellent stability. This approach also enables the fabrication of perovskite solar modules with a certified efficiency of 22.55% over a 26.02 cm2 aperture area.

         <title>Green Solvent&#8208;Processed Organic Solar Cells Approaching 20.4% Efficiency via Active Layer Pre&#8208;Solidification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique active layer pre&#8208;solidification strategy is proposed to suppress the excessive molecular aggregation and phase separation, which effectively mitigates the efficiency drops caused by various green solvents, demonstrating the excellent universality. Additionally, by suppressing the coffee&#8208;ring effect, the rigid and flexible OSC modules achieve record&#8208;breaking PCEs of 17.06% and 12.45%, respectively, exhibiting the excellent scalability.








Abstract
Green solvent fabrication of efficient organic solar cells (OSCs) is essential for their industrial scale extension and ecological sustainability, but there is typically an obvious efficiency drop during the transition from halogenated to green solvents due to the severe molecular aggregation. Here, an innovative strategy of active layer pre&#8208;solidification by liquid nitrogen freezing process is proposed to accelerate molecular precipitation and crystallization, and therefore suppress the excessive phase separation, as demonstrated by PiFM and GISAXs results. Moreover, pre&#8208;solidification process allows more solvents to carry acceptor molecules for an orderly upward migration during rapid volatilization, facilitating an ideal longitudinal gradient arrangement of photovoltaic materials that is favorable for charge transport and extraction. Consequently, PM6:L8BO&#8208;X:BO&#8208;8F OSCs fabricate with o&#8208;xylene yielded a record efficiency of 20.38%, which is comparable to 20.56% for chloroform&#8208;processed devices. The inconspicuous efficiency gaps are observed in various photovoltaic materials by using green solvents, proving the outstanding universality. In addition, the pre&#8208;solidification process effectively inhibits the coffee&#8208;ring effect in large&#8208;area active layer films and boosts the OSC modules to an exciting 17.06% efficiency. This work virtually eliminates the photovoltaic performance losses caused by green solvents, and charts a sustainable avenue to large&#8208;scale commercialization of organic photovoltaics.

         <title>Robust Mix&#8208;Charged Polyzwitterionic Hydrogels for Ultra&#8208;Efficient Atmospheric Water Harvesting and Evaporative Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional atmospheric water&#8208;harvesting&#160;hydrogels prioritize hygroscopicity at the expense of mechanics, hindering its practical applications. The proposed hygroscopic&#160;mix&#8208;charged polyzwitterionic hydrogel(THMPH)&#160;achieves a trade&#8208;off between high water absorption and exceptional mechanical robustness through a strength gradient&#8208;enhanced ionic cross&#8208;linking structure synergized with improvelithium chloride&#160;binding affinity.&#160;This design strategy significantly expands applicability to diverse practical implementations including photovoltaic thermal management.








Abstract
Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) presents great potential in addressing the increasing global challenges in freshwater and energy supply, especially in arid and semi&#8208;arid regions. The recent AWH materials focus primarily on maximizing water uptake,&#160;while conventional approaches prioritize hygroscopicity at the expense of mechanical integrity, which severely limits their applicability in real&#8208;world scenarios. In this study, a novel tunable hygroscopic mix&#8208;charged polyzwitterionic hydrogel (THMPH) is reported that achieves dual excellence in outstanding moisture absorbency and mechanical robustness. Owing to the broad ionic crosslink's degree enabling the rigid skeletal framework and energy&#8208;dissipative sacrificial networks, THMPH exhibits more than 200 times higher mechanical ductility (225&#160;kPa tensile strength retention at 200% mass swelling ratio) in comparison with the commonly&#8208;used AWH zwitterionic polybetaine. The optimized topological structure coupled with improved lithium chloride&#160;binding affinity results in excellent water uptake (2.9&#160;g&#160;g&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C, 70% RH). When THMPH is used for daytime photovoltaic panel cooling, it can provide a 15&#160;&#176;C temperature reduction of a PV panel under 1&#160;kW&#160;m&#8722;2 solar irradiation, resulting in a 7.33% increase in solar energy conversion efficiency. This hydrogel design paradigm, synergizing superior hygroscopicity with&#160;exceptional mechanical robustness, demonstrates significant potential for advancing practical applications.

         <title>In Situ Magnetoelectric Generation of miRNA Sponges and Wireless Electric Stimulus by Conductive Granular Scaffolds for Nerve Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conductive granular scaffold (cGRAS) is developed to enable wireless electrical stimulation and targeted miRNA modulation for traumatic brain injury (TBI) repair. Acting as both an antenna and a gene delivery platform, cGRAS facilitates miRNA sponge formation and neuronal regeneration via AMF&#8208;triggered electroporation and mechanotransduction, leading to reduced inflammation, enhanced angiogenesis, and improved functional recovery.








Abstract
Electronic signaling and microRNA (miRNA) regulation play pivotal roles in determining neuronal cell fate and promoting brain recovery. Despite this, clinical advancements are hindered by the limited availability of tools for spatiotemporal electrical signaling and non&#8208;viral gene modulation in neurons in vivo. In this study, a conductive granular scaffold (cGRAS) that doubles as an antenna and neuronal gene delivery agent for targeted miRNA regulation of nerve repair in traumatic brain injury (TBI) is developed. The inherent features of granular scaffolds reduce the inflammation and glial scarring in TBI by mitigating activated microglia and stellate cells. Upon irradiation with an external alternating magnetic field (AMF), the &#8220;electromagnetic messenger&#8221; induces electrical stimulation to restore brain function and promotes temporal electroporation. This process, together with mechanotransduction capability of cGRAS, enhances the delivery and formation of miRNA sponges both in vitro and in vivo, thereby reducing the overexpression of miR6263, which is significantly upregulated upon neuronal injury. In the whole brain imaging analysis, suppression of inflammation, angiogenesis around the TBI cavity, and infiltration of newborn neurons in the injured area are observed after in situ magnetoelectric formation of miRNA sponges and wireless electric stimulus, leading to improved brain function and behavioral recovery. Overall, this cGRAS represents a potentially innovative and versatile tool for clinical neuronal regeneration engineering.

         <title>Edge States in 2D A2PbBr4 Hybrid Perovskites Enabled by Local Structural Reorganization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;energy edge states in two&#8208;dimensional hybrid lead halide perovskites are driven by Rashba/Dresselhaus spin splitting, resulting from local structural distortions at the crystal edges. Strained PbBr6 octahedra cause out&#8208;of&#8208;plane distortions, breaking inversion symmetry and enabling spin splitting. These edge states with enhanced charge dynamics facilitate efficient light emission and could improve device performance in spintronic and optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
The edge states (ES) in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) hybrid lead halide perovskites (LHPs) exhibit distinct electronic characteristics, including lower energy and longer lifetimes compared to the interior states (IS). Though the ES of these 2D LHPs show prospect of facilitating photovoltaic and optoelectronic effects, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, the occurrence of ES in a family of 2D A2PbBr4 (A = organic amine cation) LHPs is attributed to the Rashba/Dresselhaus (RD) spin splitting induced&#160;by local structural reorganization on the crystal edge. The experimental and theoretical characterizations reveal that the local structure on the crystal edge is significantly strained, which leads to considerable out&#8208;of&#8208;plane distortion of adjacent PbBr6 octahedra, local loss of inversion symmetry and therefore spin&#8208;splitting energy required for the formation of ES. This findings contribute fresh perspectives to the fundamental comprehension of the RD effect, extending the boundaries of spintronics and opening promising pathways for the conceptualization and refinement of devices centered on ES.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Controllable Liquid Transfer: From Fundamentals in Micro&#8208;Patterning to Applications in Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nature&#8208;inspired fibrous&#8208;guided direct&#8208;writing strategy, which enables controllable liquid transfer, has demonstrated advantages in making various desired micro&#8208;patterns with cm&#8208;scale uniformity, &#181;m&#8208;scale resolution, and molecular&#8208;scale orientation. This review systematically summarizes the research progress in making micro&#8208;patterns using a fibrous&#8208;guided strategy, including both the fundamentals of liquid manipulation and applications in optoelectronics, as well as the remaining challenges.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed micro&#8208;patterning is a crucial process for making high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices, since the carrier transfer behavior is closely related to the uniformity, orientation, and resolution of micro&#8208;patterns. Developing solution processes with good controllability has thus attracted increasing research interest in the last decade. Inspired by Chinese brushes, a fibrous&#8208;guided direct&#8208;writing strategy is recently developed that enables controllable liquid transfer for making micro&#8208;patterns, which is systematically reviewed from viewpoints of both the fundamentals in liquid manipulation and the applications in optoelectronics. First, a model structure of dual&#8208;conical fibers (CFs) is proposed, whose capacity in liquid transfer is featured as the dynamic liquid balance and the uniform liquid film. On the basis, triple&#8208; and multi&#8208; CFs are developed for transferring liquid onto the target substrate in a controllable manner, where the tri&#8208;phase contact line can be finely tuned. Thereafter, micro&#8208;patterns with &#181;m&#8208;scale resolution, cm&#8208;scale uniformity, and molecular&#8208;scale orientation can be achieved, as is demonstrated by the as&#8208;prepared ultrasmooth quantum dot films, highly aligned silver nanowires films, and wrinkle&#8208;free reduced graphene oxide films, respectively. The high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices, including quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes, flexible transparent electrodes, and pressure sensors, are demonstrated. Perspectives for solution&#8208;processed micro&#8208;patterning in optoelectronics are also suggested.

         <title>Origami Silicon Anodes: Geometric Design for Structural Elasticity and Connectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The origami&#8208;capsule silicon anode materials, synthesized via a magnesiothermic crystallization approach, integrate elastic 2D nanosheets (2.5&#160;nm) with built&#8208;in nanopores encapsulated in a pressure&#8208;tolerant carbon shell. This architecture ensures structural resilience, efficient ion transport, and stress&#8208;resistant integrity, achieving high capacity (2945 mAh g&#8315;1), ultralow swelling (14.7%), and 100% capacity retention at 6 A g&#8315;1 over 470 cycles.








Abstract
Achieving stable cycling of high&#8208;capacity battery electrodes with large volume changes remains a significant challenge, with their mechanical failure and sluggish kinetics, primarily due to inadequate structural accommodation and inefficient transport pathways. Here, a magnesiothermic crystallization approach is presented to construct origami capsule (OC) architectures, imparting flexibility and conformability to inherently brittle silicon, featuring highly interconnected 2D silicon nanosheets (2.5&#160;nm thickness) with built&#8208;in nanopores encapsulated within a pressure&#8208;tolerant conformal microshell. The design leverages geometric features at both the nanoscale (within nanosheets) and microscale (capsule assembly) to impart structural elasticity and connectivity for efficient stress dissipation, enhancing mechanical integrity and rapid transport kinetics. Consequently, the OC anode exhibits low electrode swelling (14.7%) at 2945 mAh g&#8722;1 and exceptional rate capability, delivering a high capacity and &#8776;100% retention after 470 cycles at a large current density of 6 A g&#8722;1. This work bridges geometric design and materials science, opening new avenues for high&#8208;performance energy storage solutions.

         <title>Neuron&#8208;Inspired Ferroelectric Bioelectronics for Adaptive Biointerfacing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Innovative ferroelectric bioelectronics (FerroE) that integrate neuron&#8208;preferred flexible and topographical properties and neuron&#8208;similar behaviors enable seamless integration and adaptive communication with both Peripheral Nervous System and Central Nervous System. These neuron&#8208;like interface materials and bioelectronics that possess indistinguishable features from neurons, will open new opportunities for next&#8208;generation brain&#8211;machine interfaces, tissue engineering materials, and biomedical devices.








Abstract
Implantable bioelectronics, which are essential to neuroscience studies, neurological disorder treatment, and brain&#8211;machine interfaces, have become indispensable communication bridges between biological systems and the external world through sensing, monitoring, or manipulating bioelectrical signals. However, conventional implantable bioelectronic devices face key challenges in adaptive interfacing with neural tissues due to their lack of neuron&#8208;preferred properties and neuron&#8208;similar behaviors. Here, innovative neuron&#8208;inspired ferroelectric bioelectronics (FerroE) are reported that consists of biocompatible polydopamine&#8208;modified barium titanate nanoparticles, ferroelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene) copolymer, and cellular&#8208;scale micropyramid array structures, imparting adaptive interfacing with neural systems. These FerroE not only achieve neuron&#8208;preferred flexible and topographical properties, but also offer neuron&#8208;similar behaviors including highly efficient and stable light&#8208;induced polarization change, superior capability of producing electric signals, and seamless integration and adaptive communication with neurons. Moreover, the FerroE allows for adaptive interfacing with both peripheral and central neural networks of mice, enabling regulation of their heart rate and motion behavior in a wireless, non&#8208;genetic, and non&#8208;contact manner. Notably, the FerroE demonstrates unprecedented structural and functional stability and negligible immune response even after 3 months of implantation in vivo. Such bioinspired FerroE are opening new opportunities for next&#8208;generation brain&#8211;machine interfaces, tissue engineering materials, and biomedical devices.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Level High&#8208;Entropy Nanozymes Enable Remarkable Endogenous Targeted Catalysis and Enhancing Tumor Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomic&#8208;level high&#8208;entropy nanozyme system is successfully constructed, which can remarkably endogenous targeted catalysis and enhance tumor photothermal therapy. The synthesized snHEAzyme@DSPE&#8208;PEG2000&#8208;cRGD@Cy7 system exhibits excellent peroxidase&#8208;like activity and high absorbance in the near&#8208;infrared range. In vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that the snHEAzyme@DSPE&#8208;PEG2000&#8208;cRGD@Cy7 system can be effectively targeted to penetrate tumor cell membranes and treat tumors.








Abstract
Nanozymes hold great potential in protecting human health. However, constructing new and efficient nanozymes is a significant challenge. Developing atomic&#8208;level nanozymes is a promising approach. Despite their potential, atomic&#8208;level high&#8208;entropy nanozymes have not been reported due to thermodynamic instability. Therefore, developing atomic&#8208;level high&#8208;entropy nanozymes are of great significance. What's more, further exploring their biomedical applications can open up new horizons for nanozymology. Here, the atomic&#8208;level high&#8208;entropy nanozyme system capable of remarkable endogenous targeted catalysis and enhancing tumor photothermal therapy is successfully constructed. The system is prepared by reduction&#8208;diffusion and grafting methods. The RuRhPtIrMo sub&#8208;nanometer high&#8208;entropy nanozyme (snHEAzyme) with about 8&#8211;10 atoms thickness is first prepared. Then, they are grafted by targeting agent DSPE&#8208;PEG2000&#8208;cRGD and imaging agent Cy7 to obtain the snHEAzyme@DSPE&#8208;PEG2000&#8208;cRGD@Cy7 nanozyme system. The synthesized snHEAzyme@DSPE&#8208;PEG2000&#8208;cRGD@Cy7 system exhibits excellent peroxidase&#8208;like activity and high absorbance in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) range. Under NIR irradiation, the nanozyme shows efficient photothermal conversion and reactive oxygen species generation effects. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the snHEAzyme@DSPE&#8208;PEG2000&#8208;cRGD@Cy7 system can be effectively targeted to penetrate tumor cell membranes and treat tumors. This work offers a new perspective on snHEAzyme fabrication and its biomedical applications.

         <title>Smart Self&#8208;Healing Anode/Electrolyte Interphases for Stabilizing Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, many researchers have attempted to develop ESAEIs or ISAEIs for stabilizing the Zn anode. ESAEIs can be divided into static ESAEIs and dynamic ESAEIs according to the evolution of ESAEIs during the cycling process, while ISAEIs include polymer&#8208;based ISAEIs and liquid metal&#8208;based ISAEIs according to the chemical composition.








Abstract
The rational design of Zn anode/electrolyte interphases (AEIs) is an effective strategy for regulating the Zn2+ stripping/plating process, as well as suppressing the interfacial side reactions. However, the formation of defects during the cycling process is still inevitable, and the exacerbation of defects would lead to the failure of the electrode, limiting the long&#8208;term stability of the Zn anode. In recent years, self&#8208;healing AEIs (SAEIs) have received great attention in Zn anode modification, as they can self&#8208;heal and suppress the defects. This review summarizes the latest progress of SAEIs for Zn anode, including extrinsic and intrinsic SAEIs. Specifically, the design strategies and self&#8208;healing mechanisms of SAEIs, their roles in stabilizing Zn anode, as well as the research methods for self&#8208;healing performance, are discussed in detail. In addition, the challenges for the research of SAEIs are also analyzed, and prospects for the future design and research of SAEIs for Zn anode are provided. This review is expected to guide the future development of high&#8208;performance SAEIs for Zn and other metal anodes.

         <title>Hofmeister Effect in Flexible Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harnessing the Hofmeister effect for smart elasticity control in flexible devices, this review reveals how ion&#8208;material interactions enable simplified and adaptive mechanical regulation. It highlights applications in flexible electronics, optics, and biomedicine, and outlines a forward&#8208;looking roadmap for developing next&#8208;generation intelligent and responsive materials.








Abstract
The Hofmeister effect has attracted considerable attention for its unique ability to modulate elasticity in flexible devices. Unlike traditional approaches that often involve complex procedures and yield unstable outcomes, the Hofmeister effect enables efficient and controllable elasticity tuning through specific ion&#8208;material surface interactions. This mechanism allows precise regulation of surface wettability, thereby facilitating dynamic adjustment of elastic properties. The review systematically summarizes the research progress on the Hofmeister effect, including its concept, underlying mechanisms, and influencing factors, with a particular focus on its applications in flexible electronics, optics, and biomedical devices. By elucidating the underlying mechanisms of ion&#8208;induced material modulation, the review highlights the potential of the Hofmeister effect to advance the design of next&#8208;generation smart materials. It aims to provide both a theoretical foundation and practical guidance for developing high&#8208;performance flexible systems.

         <title>A Smart DNA Nanoframework Enables Synergistic Photodynamic Therapy of Pancreatic Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart DNA nanoframework is constructed by precipitation polymerization and hybridization chain reaction, which enables the controlled co&#8208;delivery of Cas9 ribonucleoprotein, hemin, and Ce6 for synergistic PDT. The integrated functions of gene editing and PDT allow the substantial accumulation of 1O2 in cancer cells for enhanced cell apoptosis and inhibit tumor growth in a pancreatic cancer mouse model.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) holds great promise for treating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), one of the most lethal cancers, but its clinical application is hindered by limited generation and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to tumor hypoxia and the organism's antioxidant defense mechanisms. To address this challenge, a smart DNA nanoframework capable of controlled co&#8208;delivery of Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP), hemin, and chlorin e6 (Ce6) to enable synergistic PDT for PDAC is developed. This nanoframework employs a hybridization chain reaction and phase transition to achieve high payload loading capacity while overcoming steric hindrance. The G&#8208;quadruplex/hemin complex mimics horseradish peroxidase activity to convert endogenous H2O2 to O2, alleviating tumor hypoxia. Additionally, Cas9 RNP targets the nuclear factor E2&#8208;related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway, downregulating Nrf2 expression and diminishing the antioxidant response, thereby enhancing ROS accumulation. The synergistic effect of O&#8322; generation and Nrf2 suppression significantly enhances ROS&#8208;induced apoptosis in PDAC cells. In vitro, the system demonstrates efficient gene editing and robust downregulation of Nrf2, while in vivo studies in a PDAC mouse model reveal remarkable antitumor efficacy. This smart DNA nanoframework represents a promising strategy for enhancing PDT through precise genetic and biochemical modulation.

This work presents a multi&#8208;site passivation strategy that uses Bis(2,5&#8208;dioxopyrrolidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl) 2,2&#8242;&#8208;(propane&#8208;2,2&#8208;diylbis(sulfanediyl)) diacetate (TK&#8208;NHS) as an interfacial modifier to address the substantial performance losses when scaling up perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to large&#8208;area perovskite solar modules (PSMs). The resulting PSCs achieved an outstanding power coversion efficiency (PCE)&#160;of 26.16%, demonstrating impressive scalability, while the corresponding PSMs achieved a remarkable PCE of 22.25%.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have shown remarkable progress in laboratory&#8208;scale devices, but their scalability to large&#8208;area perovskite solar modules (PSMs) remains challenging due to significant performance loss. Here, a multi&#8208;site passivation strategy is reported by employing Bis(2,5&#8208;dioxopyrrolidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl) 2,2&#8242;&#8208;(propane&#8208;2,2&#8208;diylbis(sulfanediyl)) diacetate (TK&#8208;NHS) as an interfacial modifier to address the critical issues of interface recombination and stability in both PSCs and PSMs. TK&#8208;NHS effectively inactivates common defects, by modifying the surface of perovskite films through multi&#8208;site synergistical interactions. Additionally, a stable dipole layer formed at the interface optimizes energy level alignment, facilitating efficient electron extraction and transport. The resulting perovskite film exhibited a smoother and more homogeneous surface, thus improving interface contact and reducing nonradiative recombination. Consequently, TK&#8208;NHS&#8208;treated PSCs achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.16%, with significantly improved open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.188&#160;V and fill factor (FF) of 85.3%. The scalable potential of this multi&#8208;site passivation strategy has been verified by corresponding PSMs, delivering an impressive PCE of 22.25%. Notably, the devices exhibited exceptional operational stability, retaining 91.4% and 90% of their initial PCE after 1000 and 800 h of continuous illumination, respectively. Thereby advancing the progress of the scaled&#8208;up production of PSCs to modules.

         <title>Interface Modification of Single Atom&#8208;Nanocluster Synergistic Sites to Break the Activity&#8208;Selectivity&#8208;Stability Trade&#8208;Off in Selective Hydrogenations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interfacial modification strategy is introduced to precisely tailor the interface and electronic structure of palladium single atoms and clusters (Pd1+Pdn) synergistic sites. Catalytic experiments and spectroscopic characterization revealed site&#8208;specific adsorption&#8211;desorption behaviors and interface&#8208;enhanced H&#8208;spillover capacities on NC&#8208;modified Pd1+Pdn synergistic sites, thus achieving remarkable enhancements in activity, selectivity, and stability for selective hydrogenation reactions.








Abstract
Synergistic sites (M1+Mn) integrating single atoms (M1) and clusters (Mn) exhibit tremendous promise for overcoming linear scaling relationships. However, metal entities spatial segregation within synergistic sites impedes the overall optimization and structure&#8208;property analysis, and the support interface of the M1 and Mn sites critical for intermediate adsorption&#8208;transfer kinetics has yet unexplored. Here, for the first time, interfacial modification strategy is proposed to modulate the interface and electronic structure of M1+Mn sites. This is systematically altered that the interface of Pd1+Pdn sites from hydroxyapatite (HAP) to nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;modified HAP (NC/HAP) and pure NC, with all sites maintaining the comparable size and content. In the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes, volcano&#8208;type correlations between Pd1+Pdn sites with varying interfaces and hydrogenation activities are observed, peaking for those supported on NC/HAP. The obtained Pd1+Pdn@NC/HAP exhibits superior activity for alkynol&#8208;to&#8208;enol conversion, achieving a formation rate up to 3707.7&#160;mol molPd&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 while maintaining 97.2% selectivity. Comprehensive investigations propose d&#8208;band center of Pd1+Pdn sites with different interfaces as a descriptor to elucidate the volcano&#8208;type correlation for various selective hydrogenation reactions. Interfacial modification of Pd1+Pdn sites can optimize their electronic structure, adeptly managing substrates adsorption&#8211;desorption kinetic and interface H&#8208;spillover between segregated metal sites, thereby breaking &#8722;the activity&#8208;selectivity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off.

Metal&#8208;Polyphenol Meat Freshness Intelligent Monitoring Platform
In article number 2503246, Yunfei Xie, Tiancong Zhao, and co&#8208;workers propose for the first time a multi&#8208;level competitive coordination chromogenic mechanism between metal, polyphenol, and amine.

         <title>Improving the Stability of Wide Bandgap Perovskites: Mechanisms, Strategies, and Applications in Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 21, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stability of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells is reviewed, including its stabilization mechanism, stabilization methods, and application in tandem solar cells. The current challenges and future perspectives for research in this promising field are also presented.








Abstract
Tandem solar cells (TSCs) based on wide bandgap (WBG) perovskites have gained significant attention for their higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) compared to single&#8208;junction cells. The role of WBG perovskite solar cells (PSCs) as the sub&#8208;cell in tandem cells consists of absorbing high&#8208;energy photons and producing higher open&#8208;circuit voltages (VOC). However, WBG PSCs face serious phase separation issues, resulting in poor long&#8208;term stability and substantial VOC loss in TSCs. In response, researchers have developed a range of strategies to mitigate these challenges, showing promising progress, and a comprehensive review of these strategies is expected. In this review, we discuss the stability mechanism in organic&#8211;inorganic hybrids and all&#8208;inorganic WBG perovskites. Additionally, we conduct an in&#8208;depth investigation of various strategies to enhance stability, including component engineering, additive engineering, interface engineering, dimension control, solvent engineering, and encapsulation. Furthermore, the application of the WBG sub&#8208;cell in various TSCs is summarized in detail. Finally, perspectives are provided to offer guidance for the development of efficient and stable WBG sub&#8208;cell in the field of TSCs.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 21, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diabetic wound repair remains hindered by persistent inflammation, infection risks, and microenvironment dysregulation. Electromagnetic biomaterials offer transformative solutions for intelligent wound monitoring and pathological microenvironment modulation. This review summarizes the advantages, biological mechanisms, and application strategies of electromagnetic biomaterials in diabetic tissue repair, focusing on skin and bone regeneration, and highlighting their potential to enhance clinical outcomes.








Abstract
The diabetic tissue repair process is frequently hindered by persistent inflammation, infection risks, and a compromised tissue microenvironment, which lead to delayed wound healing and significantly impact the quality of life for diabetic patients. Electromagnetic biomaterials offer a promising solution by enabling the intelligent detection of diabetic wounds through electric and magnetic effects, while simultaneously improving the pathological microenvironment by reducing oxidative stress, modulating immune responses, and exhibiting antibacterial action. Additionally, these materials inherently promote tissue regeneration by regulating cellular behavior and facilitating vascular and neural repair. Compared to traditional biomaterials, electromagnetic biomaterials provide advantages such as noninvasiveness, deep tissue penetration, intelligent responsiveness, and multi&#8208;stimuli synergy, demonstrating significant potential to overcome the challenges of diabetic tissue repair. This review comprehensively examines the superiority of electromagnetic biomaterials in diabetic tissue repair, elucidates the underlying biological mechanisms, and discusses specific design strategies and applications tailored to the pathological characteristics of diabetic wounds, with a focus on skin wound healing and bone defect repair. By addressing current limitations and pursuing multi&#8208;faceted strategies, electromagnetic biomaterials hold significant potential to improve clinical outcomes and enhance the quality of life for diabetic patients.

         <title>Residue&#8208;Free Fabrication of 2D Materials Using van der Waals Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 21, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Residue&#8208;free 2D materials with exceptional cleanliness and high quality are achieved using van der Waals interaction&#8208;based fabrication and manipulation techniques, completely free from polymers and solvents. Precise manipulation enables the construction of vdW heterostructures with controlled alignment, expanding the potential of 2D materials for next&#8208;generation electronic and optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
2D materials have garnered considerable attention due to their distinctive properties, prompting diverse applications across various domains. Beyond their inherent qualities, the significance of 2D materials extends into the fabrication processes that can lead to the degradation of intrinsic performance through undesirable mechanical defects and surface contaminations. Herein, a novel fabrication technique to achieve residue&#8208;free 2D materials using van der Waals (vdW) interactions, primarily employing molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is proposed. Optical and electrical characterizations confirm the absence of residues, mechanical defects, oxidation, and strain, along with a prominent field&#8208;effect mobility of up to 60 cm2&#160;V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and an on/off ratio of &#8776;108. Furthermore, the utilization of residue&#8208;free material as a stamp enables various manipulations of flakes transferred on substrates in advance, including pick&#8208;up and release, stacking, exfoliation, wiping&#8208;out, flipping, and smoothing&#8208;out processes. Additionally, the manipulation techniques also facilitate the fabrication of vdW heterostructures with precise positioning and the desired stacking order. In this regard, the feasibility of applying this method to hexagonal boron nitride and graphite is demonstrated. It is expected that this method will offer a versatile and effective approach to enhancing the qualities of 2D material&#8208;based electronic and optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Compression&#8208;Durable Soft Electronic Circuits Enabled by Embedding Self&#8208;Healing Biphasic Liquid&#8208;Solid Metal Into Microstructured Elastomeric Channels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 21, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A compressible, stretchable conductor combining liquid (GalnSn) and solid (BilnSn) metals is designed. The solid layer resists compression, while the liquid layer self&#8208;heals cracks under strain. Embedded micropillars enhance durability, enabling stable conductivity under extreme pressure (38.2 MPa) and cyclic loads. This biphasic design allows high&#8208;resolution manufacturing of robust antennas and circuits for soft electronics.








Abstract
Compression strongly degrades the electrical conductivity of the liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;based circuits because the liquid state is prone to be squashed. Here, a new compressible and stretchable biphasic liquid&#8208;solid self&#8208;healing circuit is proposed by filling GalnSn&#8208;BilnSn biphasic metal into micropillar&#8208;embedded channels. The underlying BilnSn solid alloy layer serves as a compression resistance layer, while the upper GalnSn liquid metal layer enables the real&#8208;time filling of the cracks in the solid layer under large deformations, resulting in autonomous self&#8208;healing and maintenance of conductivity under both stretching and compression. The embedded micropillars further improved the compression durability by providing additional mechanical support. The synergistic effect between the biphasic materials and embedded micropillar enables the designed stretchable conductor to show stable performance (R/R0&lt;10) under pressure of 38.2&#160;MPa (&#8776;389.5 Kgf&#160;cm&#8722;2) and cyclic pressure of 15.8&#160;MPa over 7000 cycles (R/R0&lt;0.48%) without compromising the stretchability, whereas the liquid metal&#8208;based conductor can only endure pressure up to 2.5&#160;MPa (25.49 Kgf&#160;cm&#8722;2). The stretchable antenna and hybrid circuits fabricated using the designed biphasic metal conductor showed enhanced compression durability. The structure&#8208;confined filling strategy enabled high&#8208;resolution and scalable manufacturing. Overall, robust stability under compression significantly expands the range of possible applications of liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;based conductors in soft electronics.

         <title>Interlayer Expanded MXene Film Cathodes with Rich Defects for Flexible 2&#8208;Electron Oxalate&#8208;Based Li&#8211;CO2 Batteries: A New Path to Enhanced Energy Efficiency and Durability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 21, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A defect&#8208;rich, interlayer&#8208;expanded MXene (Ex&#8208;Ti3C2Tx&#8208;3) film cathode, with abundant uncoordinated titanium atoms, stabilizes the bi&#8208;electron pathway in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries, improving energy efficiency and durability. Its extended interlayer spacing and mesoporous structure enhance ion and CO2 transport, and the surface functionalization suppresses interfacial oxidation and maintains integrity. The battery achieves low polarization (0.39 V), high capacity (3452.33 &#181;Ah cm&#8722;2), and long life (&gt;1660 h). The foldable Ex&#8208;Ti3C2Tx&#8208;3 cathode enables flexible Li&#8211;CO2 batteries, offering potential in wearable electronics.








Abstract
Aprotic Li&#8211;CO2 batteries have garnered significant attention owing to their high theoretical energy density and potential in zero&#8208;carbon technology. However, their practical application remains hindered by sluggish CO2 reduction/evolution reaction (CRR/CER) kinetics and limited flexibility. While 2D graphene&#8208;like materials are commonly employed to settle these issues, their four&#8208;electron pathway limits efficiency and reversibility. Herein, a defect&#8208;rich, interlayer&#8208;expanded Ti3C2Tx (Ex&#8208;Ti3C2Tx) film cathode is presented for flexible Li&#8211;CO2 batteries. The extended interlayer space, reduced &#9472;OH groups, and additional uncoordinated titanium atoms of Ex&#8208;Ti3C2Tx enable abundant catalytic active sites, enhance ion and CO2 transport, and these surface functionalizations suppress interfacial oxidation. Notably, Ex&#8208;Ti3C2Tx stabilizes the bi&#8208;electron product Li2C2O4 via Ti3+/Ti2+ coupling bridges, effectively preventing disproportionation into Li2CO3, thereby significantly improving CRR/CER reversibility and lowering overpotential. Benefiting from these properties, Li&#8211;CO2 batteries with Ex&#8208;Ti3C2Tx deliver a remarkable discharge capacity of 3452.33 &#181;Ah cm&#8722;2, a low polarization potential of 0.39&#160;V, an energy efficiency exceeding 88.9%, and an ultra&#8208;long cycling life (&gt;1600 h). Furthermore, the belt&#8208;shaped flexible battery exhibits excellent flexibility and stable electrochemical performance under deformation highlighting its potential in wearable electronics. This work underscores the critical role of MXene&#8208;based materials in bi&#8208;electron electrocatalytic mechanisms, providing insights for advancing reversible Li&#8211;CO2 batteries and flexible energy storage technologies.

Abstract
The fabrication of molecular cluster&#8208;based intelligent energy storage systems remains a significant challenge due to the intricacies of multifunctional integration at the molecular level. In this work, low&#8208;valent metal atoms are successfully encapsulated within &#603;&#8208;type Keggin structures, yielding a novel cluster denoted as CuMo16. This unique structure displayed the characteristic &#8220;molybdenum red&#8221; coloration, with a high degree of reduction (76.47%), which played a pivotal role in enhancing its electrochemical properties. The specialized configuration significantly enhanced multi&#8208;proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer kinetics, enabling efficient and rapid electron storage and release, with up to thirteen electrons per molecule. To construct an intelligent energy storage device, CuMo16 is employed as a proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;active material and embedded within a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix, resulting in the flexible, wearable, rechargeable devices. The flexible electronics not only demonstrate real&#8208;time human motion detection but also exhibit remarkable energy storage performance, reaching a peak capacity of 194.19 mAh g&#8722;1 and maintaining 68.2% capacity retention after 2500 cycles. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that integrating CuMo16 significantly enhances the intelligent storage performance of flexible electronics, and molecular regulation of CuMo16 content provides an effective strategy for optimizing flexible electronic devices. This study lays the foundation for the development of cluster&#8208;based intelligent energy storage systems.

         <title>Robust and Antioxidative Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Polymer Electrolytes for Long&#8208;Cycling 4.6 V Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 21, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust and antioxidative quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes are successfully fabricated with diblock polymer brushes as multifunctional supporting films. On this basis, practical long&#8208;cycling lithium metal batteries are achieved under high areal capacities and high&#8208;voltage conditions.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (QSPEs) have been considered as one of the most promising electrolytes for high&#8208;safety high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries (LMBs). However, their inadequate mechanical properties and instability under high voltages pose significant challenges for practical applications. Herein, robust and antioxidative QSPEs are developed based on a polymer&#8208;brush&#8208;based rigid supporting film (BC&#8208;g&#8208;PLiMTFSI&#8208;b&#8208;PPFEMA, BC: bacterial cellulose, PLiMTFSI: poly(lithium (3&#8208;methacryloyloxypropylsulfonyl) (trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide), PPFEMA: poly(2&#8208;(perfluorohexyl)ethyl methacrylate)). The robust BC nanofibril backbone can produce a highly porous supporting structure with outstanding mechanical strength. More importantly, the PLiMTFSI&#8208;b&#8208;PPFEMA side&#8208;chains can not only obviously increase the conversion ratio of easily oxidized monomers in QSPEs, but also possess strong interaction with unstable electrolyte components. With such QSPEs as solid&#8208;state electrolytes, the Li/LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 full cell with a high cathode loading (20.3 mg cm&#8722;2) exhibits a specific discharge capacity of 200.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 C and demonstrates a long lifespan of 137 cycles with a highly retained capacity of 170.7 mAh g&#8722;1 under a cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5 V. More importantly, under a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6 V, a high specific capacity of 147.0 mAh g&#8722;1 after 187 cycles can be retained for solid&#8208;state Li/LiCoO2 cells. This work provides a feasible development strategy of QSPEs for practical long&#8208;cycling high&#8208;voltage LMBs.

         <title>Decoupling Strategy of Metasurface to Realize Independent Sensing and Wave Manipulations at the Same Time</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 21, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, a decoupling strategy of metasurface to realize independent sensing and wave manipulations at the same time is proposed. By allocating the reflectivity of all meta&#8208;atoms across the space&#8208;time dimensions, it is possible to realize arbitrary manipulation of electromagnetic waves while simultaneously sensing the wireless environment by the metasurface without integrating any sensors. An adaptive STCDM system is constructed and measured, showing excellent performances of sensing and wave manipulations in wireless communication scenarios.








Abstract
In recent years, integrating electromagnetic (EM) sensing and wave manipulation has become crucial for future wireless developments, significantly enhancing the application performance by acquiring complex environmental information and optimizing the distribution of EM resources. Metasurface offers unprecedented control over sensing and wave manipulation, yet a conflict arises in achieving both simultaneously. To solve the problem, a decoupling strategy is proposed to simultaneously realize sensing and wave manipulation using a space&#8208;time&#8208;coding digital metasurface (STCDM) without integrating any sensors. A space&#8208;time&#8208;coding matrix is constructed by allocating the reflectivity of all meta&#8208; atoms across the space&#8208;time dimensions, enabling arbitrary manipulation of EM waves while simultaneously acquiring the sensing information at the incident frequency from metasurface. Excellent accuracy of direction&#8208;of&#8208;arrival estimation and wave manipulation confirms the decoupling method. An adaptive STCDM system is built up to validate the strategy in wireless communications. The measured results show that the adaptive STCDM enables independent sensing and wireless communications at the same time for targets located at different positions without integrating any sensors. The proposed method may find potential applications in wireless communication, radar, and Internet of Things systems.

         <dc:description>
Multiple resonances thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitter is developed by synergizing multiple charge&#8208;transfer excited states, exhibiting excellent photoluminescence properties with a narrowband emission of 21 nm, rapid reverse intersystem crossing rate of 7.8 &#215; 105 s&#8722;1 and suppressed concentration quenching, and electroluminescence performances with high maximum external quantum efficiencies and low&#8208;efficiency roll&#8208;offs in wide doping concentrations ranges of 3&#8211;50 wt.%.








Abstract
The development of multiple resonances thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters exhibiting high efficiency, narrowband emission, rapid reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC), and suppressed concentration quenching simultaneously is of great significance yet a formidable challenge. Herein, an effective strategy is presented to realize the above target by synergizing multiple charge&#8208;transfer excited states, including short&#8208;range charge transfer (SRCT), through&#8208;bond charge transfer (TBCT), and through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT). The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept emitter 4tCz2B exhibits a bright green emission with a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 21&#160;nm (0.10&#160;eV) in solution, high photoluminescence quantum yield of 97%, fast kRISC of 7.8 &#215; 105 s&#8722;1 and significantly suppressed concentration quenching in film state. As a result, the sensitizer&#8208;free organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) achieve maximum external quantum efficiencies&#160;(EQEmaxS) of over 34.5% together with an unaltered emission peak at 508&#160;nm and FWHM of 26&#160;nm at doping concentrations ranging from 3 to 20 wt.%. Even at a doping ratio of 50 wt.%, EQEmax is still as high as 25.5%. More importantly, the non&#8208;sensitized devices exhibit significantly reduced efficiency roll&#8208;offs, with a minimum value of 13.4% at a brightness of 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2.

         <title>Regulating the Local Reaction Microenvironment at Chromium Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Efficient H2O2 Electrosynthesis in Neutral Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 21, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique metal&#8211;organic framework (Cr&#8208;TBA), featuring chromium metal sites coordinated with tetrabromoterephthalic acid with a distinctive paper&#8208;clip&#8208;like shape, is successfully synthesized. The enhanced Lewis acidity of Cr&#8208;TBA promotes the accumulation of OH&#8722; ions on the catalyst surface. By effectively regulating the local reaction microenvironment, the H2O2 electrosynthesis performances of Cr&#8208;TBA in neutral electrolytes are significantly improved, achieving remarkable Faradaic efficiencies and an excellent H&#8322;O&#8322; production rate.








Abstract
The electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide represents a promising alternative to the traditional anthraquinone process, aiming for zero pollution. However, achieving efficient electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide&#160;in neutral electrolytes is challenging due to the sluggish kinetics of the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction. To address this issue, a unique metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) featuring Cr metal sites coordinated with tetrabromoterephthalic acid (Cr&#8208;TBA) is synthesized. This specially designed MOF exhibits a distinctive paper&#8208;clip&#8208;like structure and remarkably enhanced Lewis acidity. Experimental results demonstrate that the obtained structure can facilitate the attraction of OH&#8722; ions in solution, promoting their accumulation on the catalyst surface. This enhancement leads to excellent performances of Cr&#8208;TBA in neutral electrolytes, achieving Faradaic efficiencies of 96&#8211;98% and a production rate of 13.4&#160;mol gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 at the current density of 150&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Operando spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations indicate that this modified microenvironment effectively facilitates the conversion of the *OOH intermediates to H2O2 on the catalyst surface.

         <title>Ferroelectric Polarization Effects of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts on Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 21, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelectric substrates offer a dynamic platform to enhance the catalytic performance of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By integrating high&#8208;throughput computations and machine learning, this study reveals how to take advantage of ferroelectric polarization effect to fine&#8208;tune the OER pathways on SACs. It advances the rational design of high&#8208;efficiency SACs for sustainable energy conversion.








Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) heavily depends on their substrates. However, heterojunctions with traditional substrate materials often fail to provide the desired dynamic interface effects. Here, through a systematic study of the ferroelectric heterostructure In2Se3/C&#8208;N&#8208;M, the feasibility of using ferroelectric materials to achieve dynamic optimization of the OER activity on SACs is demonstrated. The ferroelectric In2Se3 is confirmed to be an effective substrate for improving the stability of various SACs, supported by theoretical results of their negative formation energy and positive dissolution potential. Activity analysis indicates that among these In2Se3/C&#8208;N&#8208;M systems, the In2Se3/C&#8208;N&#8208;Ir can achieve near&#8208;ideal catalytic activities through polarization switching. It can unprecedentedly catalyze OER via a hybrid pathway of adsorbate evolution mechanism and O&#8208;O coupling mechanism under different pH conditions (from pH = 1 to pH = 13). Machine learning models have been developed to conduct feature analysis and make ultrafast predictions of OER activity, which identify that the interfacial charge transfer triggered by ferroelectric polarization is the key to fine&#8208;tuning the OER performance of SACs. This work provides a theoretical framework that utilizes ferroelectric polarization as a powerful approach to navigate the design of efficient SACs.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Symbiosis of Bimetallic Peroxides Nanoparticles to Induce Ferroptosis/Cuproptosis and Activate cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway for Enhanced Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 21, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The designed zinc&#8208;copper bimetallic peroxides nanoparticles, which are synthesized through a one&#8208;step symbiotic method by co&#8208;hydrolysis of metal acetates, can release Zn2+, Cu2+, and H2O2 in TME to induce ferroptosis/cuproptosis and activate cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. Therefore, anti&#8208;tumor adaptive and innate immunotherapy can be simultaneously promoted to effectively inhibit tumor growth and metastasis with assistance of immune checkpoint inhibitor.








Abstract
To improve the efficiency and application prospects of metal peroxides in tumor therapy, the synthesis of bimetallic peroxides via simple yet effective approaches will be highly significant. In this work, hyaluronic acid modified zinc&#8208;copper bimetallic peroxides (ZCPO@HA) nanoparticles are synthesized through a one&#8208;step symbiotic method by co&#8208;hydrolysis of zinc acetate and copper acetate in weakly alkaline solution, followed by modification with sodium hyaluronate. Upon decomposition in the tumor microenvironment, ZCPO@HA nanoparticles can generate a considerable content of hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH) by Fenton&#8208;like reaction between Cu2+ and self&#8208;compensating hydrogen peroxide, while downregulating the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 to induce ferroptosis. The abundant release of Cu2+ leads to the aggregation of dihydrolipoamide S&#8208;acetyltransferase and the reduction of iron&#8208;sulfur cluster proteins, causing cuproptosis. The immunogenic cell death of tumor cells releases abundant damage associated molecular patterns, effectively activating the adaptive immune response. Zn2+ and &#183;OH cause mitochondrial damage, leading to the release of a substantial amount of mitochondrial DNA. This subsequently activates the cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8208;adenosine monophosphate synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway, enhancing the innate immune response. In conclusion, it synthesizes a new type of bimetallic peroxides by one&#8208;step symbiosis for activating anti&#8208;tumor immunotherapy combined with immune checkpoint inhibitor.

         <title>Enhanced Heat Transfer for Thermomagnetic Generation in Low&#8208;grade Waste Heat Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 21, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a breakthrough in overcoming the limitation of slow heat transfer by producing a novel Ni&#9472;Mn&#9472;In/In composite. The heat transfer property is significantly enhanced due to not only the high thermal conductivity of In metal but also the dense structure reducing phonon scattering. This innovation leads to a substantial increase in thermal conductivity and thermomagnetic generation performance, positioning our composite as a promising candidate for efficient waste heat harvesting.








Abstract
Thermomagnetic generation (TMG) is a potential technology for harvesting low&#8208;grade waste heat. However, the limited heat transfer of TMG materials constrains their practical performance. In this study, low&#8208;melting point metal indium (In) with high thermal conductivity is introduced into a Ni&#9472;Mn&#9472;In Heusler alloy to fabricate Ni&#9472;Mn&#9472;In/In TMG composites. The thermal conductivity increased significantly from 14.86&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 for the Ni&#9472;Mn&#9472;In alloy to 65.2&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 for the Ni&#9472;Mn&#9472;In/In composite. The composite containing 40&#160;wt.% In (In40) exhibits superior TMG performance, with an average voltage of 2.38&#160;mV g&#8722;1, a maximum power density of 0.433 &#181;W g&#8722;1, and a cost index of 0.116 &#181;W per CNY, which are 3.8, 2.4, and 1.1 times higher than those of the Ni&#9472;Mn&#9472;In alloy. By further changing the geometry, a 2&#160;mm thick In40 with 7 holes achieves a thermal conductivity 15 times higher and a power generation index 8 orders of magnitude greater than those of other reported TMG materials. The combination of enhanced TMG performance and improved heat transfer, along with zero thermal hysteresis, good machinability, high corrosion resistance, and long&#8208;term cycle stability, makes this composite a strong candidate for low&#8208;grade waste heat recovery applications.

         <dc:description>
An alcogel&#8208;based vertical thermal diode smart wall with interfacial evaporation for ambient thermal energy harvesting and spontaneous cooling/heating supply to the built environment. Owing to the vertical thermal diode structure design, the evaporation&#8208;condensation&#8208;based smart wall (ECSW) features flexible climate&#8208;adaptative heat transfer characteristics with a heat transfer coefficient from 3.33 to &#8776;30 W m&#8722;2 K&#8722;1 and building energy savings at 66.47% in Kunming.








Abstract
Traditional building envelopes with constant thermophysical properties constrain their capabilities in temperature regulation. Whether it is possible to achieve single&#8208;direction heat transfer along building envelopes with climate&#8208;adaptative thermophysical properties to enhance passive heat gain in winter and thermal dissipation in summer? In this work, through the capillary effect in interfacial evaporation and thermal diode structure, single&#8208;direction heat transfer with passively adjustable thermal properties in a vertical building envelope is practically achieved. An evaporation&#8208;condensation&#8208;based smart wall (ECSW) is manufactured for spontaneous and continuous cooling/heating supply to the built environment. The ECSW features climate&#8208;adaptative heat transfer characteristics with heat transfer coefficient transiting from 3.33 to &#8776;30&#160;W m&#8722;2 K&#8722;1. Additionally, coupling with radiant cooling and photothermal capabilities, ECSW shows excellent thermal performances, i.e., a heat transfer at 5.44&#160;W m&#8722;2 by radiant cooling with a 5 &#176;C cooler surface, and a heat transfer at 387.68&#160;W m&#8722;2 under solar illumination at 1000&#160;W m&#8722;2. Simulation results show that the ECSW enables building energy savings at 66.47% in Kunming. This study first reports vertical thermal diode building envelopes utilizing natural heating/cooling sources through interfacial evaporation for passive temperature regulation with low costs, performance stability and energy&#8208;saving potentials for smart and sustainable buildings.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Solution Processable Red TADF&#8208;OLED with External Quantum Efficiency Exceeding 28% Using a Multi&#8208;Resonance Emitter Host</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 21, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A red thermally activated delayed fluorescent emitter, named PBCNT, exhibits intense red emission at 664&#160;nm in a toluene solution and a solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diode based on PBCNT achieved a record&#8208;high maximum external quantum efficiency of 28.5% with a red emission peak at 608&#160;nm using a multi&#8208;resonance type thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitter.








Abstract
Achieving high&#8208;efficiency soluble red thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters remains a substantial challenge owing to the constraints imposed by the energy&#8208;gap law. In this study, an asymmetric pyrene&#8208;azaacene derivative, named PBCNT, is prepared and characterized, featuring a strong electron&#8208;donating tert&#8208;butyl diphenylamine moiety and an electron&#8208;withdrawing cyano group. PBCNT exhibits intense red emission with a peak wavelength of 664&#160;nm in a toluene solution. It demonstrates an evident TADF character in the solid state, attributed to a small energy difference of 0.04&#160;eV between its lowest singlet and triplet states. By employing a multi resonance&#8208;type TADF molecule as the host matrix, a solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) based on PBCNT achieved a record&#8208;high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 28.5%, with a red emission peak at 608&#160;nm, facilitated by effective F&#246;rster energy transfer, good horizontal emitting dipole orientation and managed intermolecular interactions between the host and dopant. This represents one of the highest EQE values reported among solution&#8208;processed red TADF OLEDs emitting electroluminescence at wavelengths greater than 600&#160;nm. This paper introduces a promising pathway for developing efficient red TADF emitters that overcome the limitations of the energy&#8208;gap law.

         <title>Optothermal&#8208;Stimulated Persistent Luminescence Imaging and Therapy (OSPLIT)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 21, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports an effective strategy, OSPLIT (optothermal&#8208;stimulated persistent luminescence imaging and therapy), which enables high&#8208;contrast imaging and the thermal ablation of lymph node metastases. The rational design of these nanomaterials is detailed and mechanistic insights are provided, demonstrating the advantages of optothermal&#8208;stimulated NIR&#8208;II persistent luminescence in lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles over conventional NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging.








Abstract
Persistent luminescent nanomaterials have significantly advanced in vivo bioimaging and biosensing by emitting photons after excitation ceases, effectively minimizing tissue autofluorescence. However, their application in biomedical fields such as tumor theranostics is limited by low brightness and rapid signal decay. To address these issues, OSPLIT (optothermal&#8208;stimulated persistent luminescence imaging therapy), a dual&#8208;function strategy for imaging and treatment is introduced. The OSPLIT approach enhances the release of charge carriers from deep traps in lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles, resulting in a 73 fold increase in persistent luminescence within the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window. In living mice, it enables high&#8208;contrast imaging of lymph node metastases, with a signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio 11.8 times greater than conventional NIR&#8208;II fluorescence. Optothermal&#8208;boosted nanoparticles are effective in ablating lymph node metastasis and preventing tumor spread. These findings highlight the potential of optothermal stimulation to enhance persistent luminescence for both imaging and therapeutic applications.

         <title>A Bioinspired Micro&#8208;Grooved Structure for Low Snow Adhesion and Effective Snow&#8208;Shedding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 21, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired micro&#8208;groove structure is developed to address the challenges of snow and ice accumulation. By minimizing capillary effects, and reducing mechanical interlocking, this multifunctional design highlights two key metrics for snow prevention surfaces: adhesion reduction and shedding efficiency, paving the way for applications in energy systems and architecture.








Abstract
Many outdoor devices require effective snow prevention solutions, yet existing passive anti&#8208;icing technologies are inadequate for snow repellency due to the variability of snow properties. This study addresses this gap by proposing a bioinspired micro&#8208;grooved anti&#8208;snow structure that minimizes van der Waals forces through reduced contact area and mitigates capillary effects via a V&#8208;shaped design, facilitating the separation of liquid water at the interface. Snow&#8208;shedding performance is shown to be highly sensitive to surface roughness, with the periodic smoothness of micro&#8208;grooves significantly reducing mechanical interlocking with snow. In contrast, hierarchical superhydrophobic structures strongly interlock with ice grains, preventing spontaneous snow&#8208;shedding even at extremely low adhesion forces. By embedding superhydrophobic nanoparticles into the micro&#8208;groove structure, this study presents a multifunctional design that integrates anti&#8208;icing, anti&#8208;snow, and water&#8208;repellent properties. Experimental results demonstrate that the structure effectively balances adhesion reduction and snow&#8208;shedding performance, showing promising potential for photovoltaic solar power systems and large&#8208;scale architectural applications.

         <title>Enabling Multicolor Circularly Polarized Organic Long Persistent Luminescence through Chiral Exciplex</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 21, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;lived circularly polarized organic long persistent luminescence (CP&#8208;OLPL) is achieved by constructing a chiral exciplex system, with green CP&#8208;OLPL emission lasting over 1.5 hours and exhibiting an asymmetry factor of 4.5 &#215; 10&#8722;3. Additionally, by incorporating a fluorophore emitter and utilizing synergistic singlet&#8208;singlet and chirality energy transfer, an orange&#8208;red CP&#8208;OLPL with a duration exceeding 1 hour is realized, showcasing its potential for applications in&#160;afterglow display and lighting, and multi&#8208;level information encryption.








Abstract
Circularly polarized organic long persistent luminescence (CP&#8208;OLPL) has garnered significant attention due to its distinctive properties. However, achieving CP&#8208;OLPL materials with ultralong durations remains a formidable challenge.

&lt;p&gt;Long-lived circularly polarized organic long persistent luminescence (CP-OLPL) is achieved by constructing a chiral exciplex system, with green CP-OLPL emission lasting over 1.5 hours and exhibiting an asymmetry factor of 4.5 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Additionally, by incorporating a fluorophore emitter and utilizing synergistic singlet-singlet and chirality energy transfer, an orange-red CP-OLPL with a duration exceeding 1 hour is realized, showcasing its potential for applications in&#160;afterglow display and lighting, and multi-level information encryption.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circularly polarized organic long persistent luminescence (CP-OLPL) has garnered significant attention due to its distinctive properties. However, achieving CP-OLPL materials with ultralong durations remains a formidable challenge. Herein, an effective strategy is proposed to obtain long-lived CP-OLPL by constructing a self-designed chiral donor for developing a host&#8211;guest chiral exciplex system. The gradual recombination of long-lived charge-separated states enables a green CP-OLPL emission to persist for over 1.5 hours with an asymmetry factor (|&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;|) of 4.5 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;. More intriguingly, doping with rubrene fluorophore yields an orange-red CP-OLPL system, exhibiting a duration over 1 hour and |&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;| of 2.3 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; through synergistic singlet-singlet and chirality energy transfer. These properties render the development of chiral afterglow display, multi-level information encryption, and afterglow lighting.

         <title>Electrochemical Lattice Engineering of Bismuthene for Selective Glycine Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 21, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Bi&#8208;based catalyst is developed via the electrochemical transformation of bismuth&#8208;oxide composites, inducing enhanced lattice strain to optimize catalytic performance. At an applied potential of &#8722;0.76&#160;V versus RHE, the catalyst exhibits outstanding efficiency in glycine electrosynthesis, achieving a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 79.1% and a record&#8208;high glycine concentration of 0.17&#160;m, significantly outperforming conventional Bi&#8208;based systems. Moreover, the introduction of glycolaldehyde and hydroxylamine as reactants further elevate the glycine FE to 91.3%, with an impressive production rate of 2433.3&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 under identical conditions.








Abstract
Glycine plays a crucial role in various industrial and daily applications. However, traditional synthesis methods are often associated with high toxicity, energy intensity, and inefficiency. This study introduces an efficient and eco&#8208;friendly method for synthesizing glycine via the reductive coupling of oxalic acid and nitrate using a Bi metal catalyst, enhanced by lattice strain from Bi and oxide composites undergoing electrochemical transformation. At an applied potential of &#8722;0.76&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), the Bi catalyst achieves an impressive glycine Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 79.1%, yielding a record concentration of 0.17&#160;m, substantially higher than conventional Bi&#8208;based systems. Furthermore, the introduction of glycolaldehyde and hydroxylamine as reactants raise the glycine FE to 91.3% with a production rate of 2433.3&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 under identical conditions. Electrochemical analysis and theoretical calculations demonstrate that lattice expansion notably boosts glycine synthesis by facilitating NH2OH formation and promoting the efficient reduction of oxime intermediates. These results underscore the significance of lattice engineering in enhancing active site performance and accelerating reaction kinetics, offering a sustainable and efficient alternative to traditional glycine synthesis methods.

         <title>Visual Engineering Achieved with Electronegative Carbon Dots for Highly Efficient Ion Flux Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 21, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research introduces a novel &#8220;visual engineering&#8221; strategy using electronegative CDs for dual&#8208;functional separator modification. The CDs enable real&#8208;time UV monitoring of coating uniformity and regulate Li&#8208;ion flux, enhancing battery performance by suppressing dendrite growth and polysulfide shuttling in both lithium&#8208;metal and lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. This innovative approach bridges optics and electrochemistry, offering a versatile solution for advanced energy storage systems.








Abstract
Various modification methods for lithium&#8208;metal battery separators have been well explored in the past decades, among which the most common process is to coat modified slurries onto the separators by blade&#8208;coating method. However, the distribution of the slurries is often non&#8208;uniform in this process, while the uniformity usually needs to be detected by electron microscope, which is time and cost&#8208;consuming. To solve this long&#8208;standing technical issue, it focuses on the &#8220;visualization&#8221; of modification effect with negatively charged carbon dots under UV light, and deeply investigates the ion transport problem caused by the non&#8208;uniform material modification. With this unique &#8220;visual engineering&#8221; strategy, uniform separator can be easily detected, which further allows for the construction of a uniform negative shielding layer and cation channels. It accelerates the ion transport process, realizes a stable Li stripping and deposition process, and avoids dendrite growth. To this end, in symmetric batteries with different electrolyte compositions, stable operation of 1200 h can be achieved. In addition, negatively charged polysulfide shuttles can be greatly suppressed, thus avoiding the infamous &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. This work provides a new avenue for screening well&#8208;modified separators through &#8220;visual engineering&#8221;, further accelerating the practical application of series of rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Enhanced Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Electrodes with Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Additives Featuring Undercoordinated Zr4+ Sites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 21, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) possessing coordinately unsaturated Zr4+ sites are exploited as a new material library of electrode additives for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), which simultaneously boost lithium&#8208;ion conduction within electrodes and deliver step&#8208;change electrochemical performances. Such a cost&#8208;effectiveness MOF additive approach illuminates a new avenue toward advancing industry&#8208;relevant LIBs.








Abstract
Performances of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) are dictated by processes of electron&#8208;ion separation, transfers, and combination. While carbon additives are routinely used to ensure electronic conductivity, additives capable of simultaneously boosting ion conduction and delivering step&#8208;change performance remain elusive. Herein, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) possessing coordinately unsaturated Zr4+ sites are exploited as a new material library of electrode additives. The MOFs imbue infused electrolytes with an expanded electrochemical stability window (0 to 5&#160;V vs Li/Li&#8314;) and enhanced Li&#8314; transport efficiency. Mechanistically, strong interactions between Zr4+ sites and Li+ solvation sheaths result in trimmed, anion&#8208;fixed, and solvent&#8208;separated ion pairs, mitigating electrostatic coupling and enabling efficient Li&#8314; translocation in the porous nanospace. Concomitantly, these solvation structural modulations foster interfacial and electrochemical stabilities. When implemented at 1.7 wt.% in graphite and sub&#8208;Ah full cell, the MOF additives significantly improved Li+ diffusional kinetic, rate capability beyond 2C, and cycling longevity doubling lifespan. This work offers a straightforward yet effective route to remedy the bottlenecks of industrial LIBs.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Lanthanide Halide Glass Scintillators Enabled by Dehydration for Efficient X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 21, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an effective strategy for developing high&#8208;performance hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic lanthanide halide glass scintillators for X&#8208;ray imaging through the dehydration of crystalline precursors. This process not only effectively suppresses melt crystallization but also enhances radioluminescence by improving X&#8208;ray&#8208;to&#8208;visible photon conversion efficiency. Thus, it enables the fabrication of large, transparent scintillators suitable for high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging.








Abstract
Although glass scintillators hold great promise for high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging, the practical application is often limited by thermodynamic instability, leading to uncontrolled glass&#8208;to&#8208;crystal transformations that degrade imaging resolution. Herein, a novel strategy is presented to synthesize (methyl(triphenyl)phosphonium)3EuCl6 ((MTP)3EuCl6) glass scintillators through the dehydration of their crystalline precursors. The findings reveal that the dehydration process significantly enhances the stability of the glass scintillators by confining the constituent ions within a rigid, highly viscous matrix. This confinement effectively restricts ion mobility and prevents the reorganization required for crystal nucleation. Moreover, the dehydration reduces the trapping of in situ generated charge carriers and increases the photoluminescence quantum yield, leading to enhanced radioluminescence performance. The resulting (MTP)3EuCl6 glass scintillators demonstrate an X&#8208;ray detection limit as low as 95.8 nGyair s&#8315;&#185; and achieve a spatial imaging resolution of 14.3 lp mm&#8722;1 at a dose rate of 5 mGyair s&#8315;&#185;. This work provides valuable insights into designing glass scintillators that integrate long&#8208;term thermodynamic stability with optimized scintillation performance, offering significant potential for advanced X&#8208;ray imaging applications.

&lt;p&gt;This study presents an effective strategy for developing high-performance hybrid organic-inorganic lanthanide halide glass scintillators for X-ray imaging through the dehydration of crystalline precursors. This process not only effectively suppresses melt crystallization but also enhances radioluminescence by improving X-ray-to-visible photon conversion efficiency. Thus, it enables the fabrication of large, transparent scintillators suitable for high-resolution X-ray imaging.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although glass scintillators hold great promise for high-resolution X-ray imaging, the practical application is often limited by thermodynamic instability, leading to uncontrolled glass-to-crystal transformations that degrade imaging resolution. Herein, a novel strategy is presented to synthesize (methyl(triphenyl)phosphonium)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;EuCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; ((MTP)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;EuCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) glass scintillators through the dehydration of their crystalline precursors. The findings reveal that the dehydration process significantly enhances the stability of the glass scintillators by confining the constituent ions within a rigid, highly viscous matrix. This confinement effectively restricts ion mobility and prevents the reorganization required for crystal nucleation. Moreover, the dehydration reduces the trapping of in situ generated charge carriers and increases the photoluminescence quantum yield, leading to enhanced radioluminescence performance. The resulting (MTP)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;EuCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; glass scintillators demonstrate an X-ray detection limit as low as 95.8 nGy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt; s&#8315;&#185; and achieve a spatial imaging resolution of 14.3 lp mm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at a dose rate of 5 mGy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt; s&#8315;&#185;. This work provides valuable insights into designing glass scintillators that integrate long-term thermodynamic stability with optimized scintillation performance, offering significant potential for advanced X-ray imaging applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Metal Exsolution&#8208;Redissolution of High&#8208;Entropy Oxide Enabling High&#8208;Performance Dry Reforming of Methane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 21, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) catalysts are developed to show unprecedented active and durable performance in photothermal dry reforming of methane due to the light&#8208;induced metal exsolution&#8208;dissolution process. Such a mechanism triggers the chemical looping of oxygen vacancies on HEO and greatly improves product formation and coking resistance.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven dry reforming of methane (DRM) is attractive for syngas production as an energy&#8208;efficient and environmentally friendly process. However, the remaining challenges of low yield and coke&#8208;induced inability in this route severely limit its applicability. Here, a light&#8208;induced metal exsolution&#8208;dissolution strategy is reported using high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) as a support for highly active and durable photothermal DRM. As evidenced by structural characterizations and theoretical simulations, the metal exsolution&#8208;dissolution process triggers the chemical looping of oxygen vacancies on HEO, in which CH4 is activated to CO and H2 by lattice oxygen while oxygen from CO2 can fill the oxygen vacancy and release CO. Such a pathway greatly improves product formation and coking resistance, overcoming the limitations. As a result, the optimized CoNiFeZnCr&#8208;HEO supported Rh nanocomposite achieves a high H2/CO production of 0.242/0.246&#160;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 with a balance selectivity of 0.98 and impressive long&#8208;term stability (200&#160;h). The yield is &#8776;300 and 450 times higher than that of quaternary and ternary oxides&#8208;based catalysts, respectively. This work paves the way for new insights into the light&#8208;driven DRM process and highlights the integration of dynamic surface evolution with molecular activation to enhance catalytic performance.

         <title>Electric Field&#8208;Induced Dual&#8208;Gradient Heterojunction Diodes Toward Ultrasensitive Self&#8208;Powered Ionic Skin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 21, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal strategy for constructing ultrasensitive self&#8208;powered sensing materials with dual&#8208;gradient heterojunctions is developed through the induction of anionic and cationic polymer gradient distribution under direct current electric field.








Abstract
The hydrogel ionic diode is regarded as a promising self&#8208;powered sensor, capable of harvesting energy from low&#8208;frequency stimuli human motions and converting it into electrical signals. However, the sensitivity of the reported conventional bilayer hydrogel ionic diodes are relatively low, due to the single heterojunction interface and high interface resistance, making it challenging to meet the demands of high&#8208;precision sensing. Here, a universal method for fabricating dual&#8208;gradient hydrogel ionic diodes without bilayer structure through the induction of anionic and cationic polymer gradient distribution via a direct current electric field is developed. Due to the dual&#8208;gradient distribution, numerous heterogeneous microstructures (i.e., microdiodes) with low interface resistance are formed in the bulk phase of hydrogel, and these series&#8208;connected microdiodes demonstrate a significantly increase in open circuit voltage in response to mechanical pressure. The dual&#8208;gradient hydrogel ionic diode exhibits ultra&#8208;high sensitivity (1247.3&#160;mV/MPa) and ultralow detection limit (0.8&#160;Pa), enabling the smart prosthetic hand to non&#8208;destructive grasp ultrasoft tofu. This work is expected to pave the way for novel high&#8208;precision self&#8208;powered sensors in intelligent wearable electronics.

         <title>Nonlinear Optical Properties of 0D Chiral Hybrid Bismuth Iodides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 21, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optically stable lead&#8208;free 0D chiral (R/S&#8208;methyl&#8208;benzyl&#8208;amine)&#8208;bismuth&#8208;iodide crystals showcase promising second and third&#8208;order nonlinear optical properties. The chiral compounds show significant circularly polarized second harmonic generation. The achiral counterpart exhibits the most efficient third&#8208;order optical nonlinearity.








Abstract
Chiral hybrid metal halides show great promise for nonlinear optical (NLO) applications like circularly polarized second harmonic generation (SHG). The inherent toxicity of lead is a concern for the widespread adoption of frequently explored lead&#8208;based chiral hybrid halides. Here, we report the second and third&#8208;order NLO properties of lead&#8208;free 0D chiral compounds, (R&#8208;/S&#8208;MBA)4Bi2I10, and their achiral counterpart, (Rac&#8208;MBA)4Bi2I10 (MBA: methylbenzylammonium) under excitation wavelength ranging 1360&#8211;1590&#160;nm. Chiral (R&#8208;/S&#8208;MBA)4Bi2I10 exhibits strong SHG along with stronger third harmonic generation (THG). The chiral crystals showed high sensitivity to the handedness of circularly polarized pump light (gSHG &#8722; CD &#8776; 9% at 1510&#160;nm). The THG response shows resonance enhancement matching the excitonic absorption. Achiral (Rac&#8208;MBA)4Bi2I10 exhibits the maximum THG response (&#967;(3) = 1.05 &#215; 10&#8315;&#185;&#8312;&#160;m2&#160;V&#8722;2). Z&#8208;scan measurements with non&#8208;resonant femtosecond pulse excitation at 800&#160;nm yield high nonlinear absorption coefficients (&#946;) and nonlinear refractive index (n2) for all three samples, with (Rac&#8208;MBA)4Bi2I10 exhibiting the highest values. These hybrid chiral metal halides, with efficient second and third&#8208;order nonlinearity, and high optical stability, are potential candidates for NLO applications such as Kerr&#8208;based optical switching, circularly polarized up&#8208;conversion, and communication.

         <title>Na&#8208;Hybridized LiNbO3 Nanocrystal&#8208;Glass Composites for Ultra&#8208;Short Optical Pulse Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 21, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Na&#8208;hybridization strategy is proposed to reduce defects in LiNbO3&#8208;NGC, enhancing its nonlinear properties. By using this hybridized LiNbO3&#8208;NGC, the transverse second&#8208;harmonic generation is achieved. An ultrashort optical pulse monitoring system is constructed which are demonstrated for real&#8208;time quantitative measurement of the duration, distribution, and front tilting of optical pulses in the 10&#8722;15 s scale.








Abstract
LiNbO3 nanocrystal&#8208;glass composites (LiNbO3&#8208;NGC), characterized by its unique 3D random domain structure, have shown great promise for significant applications, such as femtosecond pulse monitoring and full&#8208;color 3D displays. However, the nonlinear response of the LiNbO3&#8208;NGC is greatly suppressed by the defects, and effective manipulation of these defects remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. In this study, a Na&#8208;hybridization strategy is proposed to control defects in the LiNbO3&#8208;NGC to enhance its nonlinear properties and realizing its practical application for ultrashort optical pulse monitoring. The findings reveal that the incorporation of Na ions effectively reduces the defects within the composite, resulting in significantly improved nonlinear effects.

&lt;p&gt;A Na-hybridization strategy is proposed to reduce defects in LiNbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-NGC, enhancing its nonlinear properties. By using this hybridized LiNbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-NGC, the transverse second-harmonic generation is achieved. An ultrashort optical pulse monitoring system is constructed which are demonstrated for real-time quantitative measurement of the duration, distribution, and front tilting of optical pulses in the 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;15&lt;/sup&gt; s scale.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LiNbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanocrystal-glass composites (LiNbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-NGC), characterized by its unique 3D random domain structure, have shown great promise for significant applications, such as femtosecond pulse monitoring and full-color 3D displays. However, the nonlinear response of the LiNbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-NGC is greatly suppressed by the defects, and effective manipulation of these defects remains a long-standing challenge. In this study, a Na-hybridization strategy is proposed to control defects in the LiNbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-NGC to enhance its nonlinear properties and realizing its practical application for ultrashort optical pulse monitoring. The findings reveal that the incorporation of Na ions effectively reduces the defects within the composite, resulting in significantly improved nonlinear effects. By using this hybridized LiNbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-NGC, the transverse second-harmonic generation is achieved. An ultrashort optical pulse system is also constructed and successfully applied it for real-time quantitative measurement of the duration, distribution, and front tilting of optical pulses in the 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;15&lt;/sup&gt; s scale. These results not only present an excellent example about defect engineering in nonlinear LiNbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-NGC but also point to practical applications for the measurement of extreme physical parameters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Template&#8208;Catalyzed Mass Production of Size&#8208;Tunable h&#8208;BN Nanosheet Powders</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 21, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 3D template&#8208;catalyzed growth (3D&#8208;TCG) method is developed for kilogram&#8208;scale production of few&#8208;layered 2D nanosheet powders with high efficiency. The template&#8208;catalyzed growth mechanism of this approach enables the high&#8208;quality and controllable lateral sizes from 100&#160;nm to 10&#160;&#181;m of the products, demonstrating promising viability for large&#8208;scale practical applications.








Abstract
Bulk availability of 2D material powders presents broad opportunities for various industrial applications. Particle size and morphology control are critical factors that govern their properties, and in particular, large&#8208;scale size&#8208;controlled production of 2D materials nanosheets remains extremely challenging. Herein, a novel 3D template&#8208;catalyzed growth (3D&#8208;TCG) method is demonstrated that allows the mass production of size&#8208;tunable 2D hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) nanosheet powders, a key material in the 2D materials family. Rather than limiting the nanosheet growth on 2D substrate surfaces, this method provides large numbers of active sites distributed in 3D space, leading to the feasibility of scale&#8208;up production with excellent product homogeneity and high efficiency. Ultrathin h&#8208;BN nanosheets are synthesized with high throughput (kilogram quantities) and lateral sizes that can be tuned from 100&#160;nm to 10&#160;&#181;m with thicknesses of few layers. Their practical application is demonstrated in lithium metal batteries, where the obtained nanosheet powders are processed and roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll coated on commercial separators (&gt;10 m2). The prototype pouch cell delivers high energy density (501.8&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) and improved cycling stability. The template&#8208;based large&#8208;scale production strategy can be used to generically produce various types of bulk pristine 2D nanopowders with potential for many large&#8208;scale applications.

         <title>Enhancing Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis in Heazlewoodite: Unveiling the Critical Role of Entropy Levels and Surface Reconstruction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 21, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative high&#8208;entropy heazlewoodite is synthesized, where the formation of a high&#8208;entropy phase significantly enhanced oxygen evolution reaction activity, and the oxidation potential evolved stabilized high&#8208;entropy sulfide&#8208;hydroxide oxide species at the interface improved electrochemical stability.








Abstract
Entropy engineering has proven effective in enhancing catalyst electrochemical properties, particularly for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Challenges persist, however, in modulating entropy and understanding the dynamic reconfiguration of high&#8208;entropy sulfides during OER. In this study, an innovative in situ corrosion method is introduced to convert low&#8208;valent nickel on a nickel foam substrate into high&#8208;entropy heazlewoodite (HES/NF), significantly boosting OER performance. By synthesizing a series of low&#8208;, medium&#8208;, and high&#8208;entropy heazlewoodites, the intrinsic factors influence catalyst surface evolution and electrocatalytic activity is systematically explored. Employing a combination of in situ and ex situ characterization techniques, it is observed that HES/NF dynamically transforms into a stable hydroxide oxide (MOOH)&#8208;sulfide composite under OER conditions. This transition, coupled with lattice distortion, optimizes the electrostatic potential distribution, ensuring superior catalytic activity and preventing surface sulfide deactivation through the formation of stable HES&#8208;MOOH species. This synergy enables HES/NF to achieve remarkably low overpotentials: 172.0&#160;mV at 100.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 229.0&#160;mV at an extreme current density of 300.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. When paired with a Pt/C cathode, HES/NF exhibits rapid kinetics, outstanding stability, and exceptional water&#8208;splitting performance. The scalable, cost&#8208;effective approach paves the way for advanced electrocatalyst design, promising breakthroughs in energy storage and conversion technologies.

         <title>Gallium&#8208;Magnesium Layered Double Hydroxide for Elevated Tumor Immunotherapy Through Multi&#8208;Network Synergistic Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 21, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;network synergistic treatment strategy is designed to form a powerful therapeutic network to improve tumor immunotherapy by coordinating multiple immune activation mechanisms such as autophagy blocking, ferroptosis, pyroptosis, immunogenic cell death, and STING activation, which improves the immunogenicity, reverses the immunosuppressive TME, breaks the immune barrier, and promotes immune cell proliferation and infiltration.








Abstract
Immunotherapeutic efficacy is often limited by poor immunogenicity, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and cytoprotective mechanisms, leading to low immune activation. To this end, here, L&#8208;amino acid oxidase (LAAO) loaded gallium&#8208;magnesium layered double hydroxide (MG&#8208;LAAO) is prepared for significantly enhanced tumor immunotherapy through multi&#8208;network synergistic regulation. First, MG&#8208;LAAO induces tumor cell pyroptosis by initiating caspase&#8208;1/GSDMD and caspase&#8208;3/GSDME pathways, further triggering immunogenic cell death (ICD). Then the released Ga3+ induces mitochondrial iron overload, resulting in ferroptosis. In addition, MG&#8208;LAAO also hinders autophagy of tumor cells, and reshapes the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) by neutralizing H+ and inhibiting lactic acid accumulation, thus destroying the cytoprotective mechanism and avoiding immune escape. Furthermore, this multi&#8208;network synergy further activates the cGAS&#8208;STING signaling pathway, generating powerful antitumor immunotherapy. This work highlights the critical role of synergies between autophagy block, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, and ICD in tumor immunotherapy, demonstrating the important role of this multi&#8208;network synergy in effectively overcoming immunosuppressive TME and enhancing immunogenicity. In particular, the mechanism of gallium&#8208;induced pyroptosis is revealed for the first time, providing theoretical support for the design of new materials for tumor immunotherapy in the future.

         <title>Improving Conversion Kinetics of Sodium Polysulfides through Electron Spillover Effect with V/Co Dual&#8208;Atomic Site Anchoring on N&#8208;Doped MXene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 21, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vanadium&#8208;cobalt (VCo) diatomic catalyst with strong electronic interactions is successfully integrated into vacancy&#8208;rich nitrogen&#8208;doped MXene for room temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT/Na&#9472;S) batteries. This catalyst exhibits a unique electron spillover effect during sodium polysulfide redox reaction, enhancing polysulfide conversion kinetics and significantly improving cycling stability.









Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#9472;sulfur (RT/Na&#9472;S) batteries, with a theoretical capacity of 1672 mAh g&#8315;1, face challenges such as the insulating nature of sulfur and slow redox kinetics, particularly during complex liquid&#8211;solid (Na2S4&#8594;Na2S2) and solid&#8211;solid (Na2S2&#8594;Na2S) conversions. Herein, vanadium&#8208;cobalt (VCo) diatomic sites implanted in vacancy&#8208;rich N&#8208;doped MXene (VCo DACs/N&#8208;MXene) are introduced to address these issues. The N&#8208;bridged VCo diatomic pairs are demonstrated and their strong electronic interactions are also validated through experimental and theoretical analyses. The RT/Na&#9472;S battery with optimized VCo DACs/N&#8208;MXene delivers an average capacity of 1255.3 mAh g&#8315;1 at 0.1 C and remarkable cycling stability, with only &#8776;0.001% capacity decay per cycle over 1500 cycles at 1 C. DFT calculations reveal that VCo diatomic sites enhance reaction kinetics by reducing the Gibbs free energy for polysulfide conversions, notably reducing the solid&#8211;solid conversion energy barriers from 1.17/0.96&#160;eV for V/Co SACs/N&#8208;MXene to 0.53&#160;eV for VCo DACs/N&#8208;MXene. XANES and DFT analyses attribute this improvement to a unique electron spillover effect, facilitating efficient electron transport during charge and discharge.

&lt;p&gt;A vanadium-cobalt (VCo) diatomic catalyst with strong electronic interactions is successfully integrated into vacancy-rich nitrogen-doped MXene for room temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT/Na&#9472;S) batteries. This catalyst exhibits a unique electron spillover effect during sodium polysulfide redox reaction, enhancing polysulfide conversion kinetics and significantly improving cycling stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Room-temperature sodium&#9472;sulfur (RT/Na&#9472;S) batteries, with a theoretical capacity of 1672 mAh g&#8315;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, face challenges such as the insulating nature of sulfur and slow redox kinetics, particularly during complex liquid&#8211;solid (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and solid&#8211;solid (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) conversions. Herein, vanadium-cobalt (VCo) diatomic sites implanted in vacancy-rich N-doped MXene (VCo DACs/N-MXene) are introduced to address these issues. The N-bridged VCo diatomic pairs are demonstrated and their strong electronic interactions are also validated through experimental and theoretical analyses. The RT/Na&#9472;S battery with optimized VCo DACs/N-MXene delivers an average capacity of 1255.3 mAh g&#8315;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1 C and remarkable cycling stability, with only &#8776;0.001% capacity decay per cycle over 1500 cycles at 1 C. DFT calculations reveal that VCo diatomic sites enhance reaction kinetics by reducing the Gibbs free energy for polysulfide conversions, notably reducing the solid&#8211;solid conversion energy barriers from 1.17/0.96&#160;eV for V/Co SACs/N-MXene to 0.53&#160;eV for VCo DACs/N-MXene. XANES and DFT analyses attribute this improvement to a unique electron spillover effect, facilitating efficient electron transport during charge and discharge. This work highlights the potential of optimizing electronic configurations and coordinating environments to activate bidirectional kinetics with improved capacity and longevity of RT/Na&#9472;S batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Lithium Dendrite Inhibitor in Graphite Anodes Enabling Fast&#8208;Charging and Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Pouch Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A Li plating regulation strategy that transforms dead Li plating into reversible active Li plating is proposed by using a lithium dendrite inhibitor to realize safe and long&#8208;lifespan LIBs. Remarkably, only 1 wt.% single&#8208;atom manganese (SAMn) in the Gr anode (Gr&#8208;SAMn) is sufficient to achieve a significant improvement, and the amount of dead Li on the Gr anode can be reduced by 90%.








Abstract
Under harsh conditions, such as high&#8208;rate and low&#8208;temperature charging, part of Li ions cannot intercalate into the graphite (Gr) particles and will form dendrite&#8208;like Li plating, causing capacity fading and serious safety hazards in commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Herein, instead of eliminating the Li plating, a Li plating regulation strategy that transforms dead Li plating into reversible active Li plating is proposed by using a lithium dendrite inhibitor to realize safe and long&#8208;lifespan LIBs. Remarkably, only 1 wt.% single&#8208;atom manganese (SAMn) in the Gr anode (Gr&#8208;SAMn) is sufficient to achieve a significant improvement, thus both the volumetric and mass&#8208;energy density remain roughly unaffected. The amount of dead Li on the Gr anode can be reduced by 90%, thereby enabling much&#8208;improved pouch cell performance at high rates and low temperatures. The capacity retention of the Gr&#8208;SAMn||NCM811 pouch cell is 86.2% (23.0% higher than that of the pristine Gr||NCM811 pouch) for 1500 cycles at 2 C, and the cell can even be cycled at 5C charge. Even cycling at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, the average coulombic efficiency (CE) can be improved from 97.95% to 99.94% by using SAMn additive. Hence, this promising strategy provides a novel alternative to solve the Li plating issue.

         <title>Designing Cellulose Triacetate&#8208;Based Universal Binder for High&#8208;Voltage Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathodes with Enhanced Ionic Conductivity and Binding Strength</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 21, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cellulose triacetate&#8208;based binder with broad compatibility, high ionic conductivity, and superior binding strength has been successfully designed and validated through its application in high&#8208;voltage polyanionic cathodes (Na3V2(PO4)2O2F), layered oxide cathodes (NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2), and tunnel&#8208;type oxide cathodes (Na0.61[Mn0.27Fe0.34Ti0.39]O2). This work presents a sustainable and effective strategy for achieving high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Binders play a pivotal role in the performance of sodium&#8208;ion battery (SIB) cathodes, but traditional binders often struggle to balance broad compatibility, high ionic conductivity, superior binding strength, and environmental sustainability. In this study, a universal cellulose triacetate (TAC)&#8208;based binder (TAC&#8208;MMT) composed of TAC and natural montmorillonite (MMT) is designed to facilitate rapid Na+ transport pathways and establish a robust hydrogen&#8208;bonding network. This innovative TAC&#8208;MMT binder features a unique chemical structure that achieves high ionic conductivity through a self&#8208;enrichment and fast&#8208;transport mechanism, while its superior binding strength is attributed to hydrogen&#8208;bonding crosslinks between proton acceptors (C&#9552;O) in TAC and proton donors (&#8722;OH) in MMT. More importantly, the outstanding solubility and film&#8208;forming properties of TAC&#8208;MMT contribute to stable electrode protection and broad compatibility with high&#8208;voltage SIB cathodes. Benefiting from these advantages, the Na3V2(PO4)2O2F (NVPOF) electrodes with the TAC&#8208;MMT binder demonstrate exceptional performance, including a high capacity retention of 95.2% over 500 cycles at 5C and a rapid rate response of up to 15C. The versatility of the TAC&#8208;MMT binder is further confirmed with high&#8208;voltage NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 and Na0.61[Mn0.27Fe0.34Ti0.39]O2 cathodes. This study highlights the potential of biomass&#8208;based binders as a sustainable and effective solution for advancing high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Pyrolysis: A Universal Route to High&#8208;Loading Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 21, May 26, 2025. </description>

This work develops a molten salt strategy for synthesizing single&#8208;atom catalysts at 450&#160;&#176;C via LiCl/KCl&#8208;mediated Fe2+/Zn2+ exchange on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon substrates. By stabilizing Fe2+ ions and suppressing the Fe&#8208;oxide nanoparticle formation&#8212;a common limitation in conventional high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis&#8212;it achieves a 3.9 wt.% Fe loading of atomically dispersed Fe&#8208;N4 sites, delivering superior H2&#8212;O2 fuel cell performance.








Abstract
High&#8208;temperature pyrolysis (HTP, &#8805;900&#160;&#176;C) is a widely used method for synthesizing single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). However, the high operational temperatures required for HTP pose significant challenges in achieving high single&#8208;atom loading, primarily due to the Ostwald ripening effect. In this work, a low&#8208;temperature trans&#8208;metalation synthesis approach is developed which involves the exchange of cation between transition metal ions (M = Fe, Co, Cu, Ni, Mn, etc) and Zn2+ ions on a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NC) matrix within a molten salt medium. This strategy effectively avoids phase transformations and enables the direct formation of high mass loading (3.7&#8211;4.7 wt.%) of atomically dispersed M&#8208;N4 sites. Both experimental and theoretical analyses confirm that this cation&#8208;exchange occurs at a lower temperature threshold of 450&#160;&#176;C, significantly reducing the energy barriers for SACs synthesis. Furthermore, the synthesized catalyst with atomically dispersed Fe sites demonstrate excellent performance toward oxygen reduction reaction and fuel cell with a peak power density of 1.12 W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in an H2&#9472;O2 fuel cell at 1.0&#160;bar and 80&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Surface Engineering of PtSe2 Crystal for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Ethanol Oxidation</title>

2D PtSe2 has been demonstrated as high&#8208;performance catalyst for electrocatalytic ethanol oxidation. Plasma treatment engineers the surface of single&#8208;crystalline PtSe2 by removing Se atoms, resulting in the exposure of PtSe2 (101) facet. Excellent EOR activity and poison&#8208;resistance are demonstrated, which is rationalized by in situ electrical transport measurement and theoretical calculations.









Abstract

The development of efficient electrocatalysts for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) is crucial for the potential commercialization of direct ethanol fuel cells, yet it faces significant challenges between catalytic performance and cost&#8208;effectiveness. 2D materials have recently emerged as a promising group of electrocatalysts due to their large surface area, efficient charge transport, tunable band structures, and excellent catalytic activity. In this study, the novel 2D layered noble&#8208;metal dichalcogenide, PtSe2, is explored for efficient ethanol oxidation electrocatalysis from a microscopic perspective based on an on&#8208;chip microelectrochemical platform. While pristine PtSe2 demonstrates similar EOR activities to Pt, argon plasma treatment significantly enhances the performance on EOR activity, If/Ib ratio, onset and peak potentials, and durability. Detail investigations reveal that plasma treatment results in the exposure of PtSe2 surface, which is responsible for significantly enhanced EOR activity and poison&#8208;resistance as also confirmed by theoretical calculations. In situ electrical transport measurements for monitoring the catalyst surface intermediates, elucidate that both optimized OHads coverage and appropriate ethanol molecular adsorption on PtSe2 are the key for the high performance. This work demonstrates noble&#8208;metal dichalcogenides as promising EOR electrocatalysts, and establishes on&#8208;chip electrocatalytic microdevice as a promising probing platform for diverse electrocatalytic measurements.

         <title>Narrowband Emissive Solution&#8208;Processed Polymer Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with External Quantum Efficiency Above 30%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 21, May 26, 2025. </description>

High&#8208;efficiency narrowband emissive themally activated delayed flurescence (TADF) polymers are realized by incorporating silicon&#9472;carbon &#963;&#8208;bond saturated spacers between multiresonance TADF units and polycarbazole backbone. The polymers exhibit a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 97% and external quantum efficiency of up to 30.2% with a narrow full width at half maximum of 42 nm in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.








Abstract
Achieving both high&#8208;efficiency and narrowband emission in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) polymers remains a formidable challenge. In this work, a proof of concept for narrowband&#8208;emissive TADF polymers with a partially conjugated structure is proposed by embedding a silicon&#9472;carbon &#963;&#8208;bond saturated spacer between the multiresonance (MR) TADF unit and the polycarbazole backbone. A series of TADF polymers PSix (x = 1, 3, and 6) is then prepared and characterized. All the polymers show narrowband emission with full width at half maximum (FWHM) values of 28&#8211;30&#160;nm in a toluene solution. Impressively, polymer PSi3 has the highest photoluminescence quantum yield, reaching 97%, in the doped films due to the efficient reverse intersystem crossing process. The solution&#8208;processed devices based on PSi3 exhibit the best performance with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 28.8% and an FWHM of 42&#160;nm. By employing the TADF molecule 5Cz&#8208;TRZ as the sensitizer, enhanced device performance with an EQEmax of 30.2% is achieved, which is in the first tier among the MR&#8208;TADF polymers reported to date. This work provides an effective strategy for achieving highly efficient and narrowband&#8208;emissive TADF polymers by controlling the &#963;&#8208;bond saturated spacer between the MR&#8208;TADF chromophore and the polymer backbone.

Selective C&#8208;H activation is a crucial step in organic molecule transformation. Photocatalytic radicals&#8208;driven C&#8208;H activation is considered a promising approach but suffers from simultaneously utilizing electron/hole pairs which are limited to broad&#8208;band gap semiconductors. A half&#8208;photocathodic reaction strategy is reported for the selective oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde using a narrow&#8208;bandgap porous CuBi2O4 photocathode. The intrinsic Cu+/Cu2+ redox of porous CuBi2O4 catalyzes the photocathodic oxygen reduction, generating H2O2&#8208;derived &#183;OH radicals that activate the C(sp3)&#8208;H bond, followed by &#183;O2&#8208;&#8208;mediated oxidation to yield benzaldehyde.








Abstract
Selective C&#8208;H activation is the most important step for organic molecule transformation. Photocatalytic radicals driven C&#8208;H activation is considered a promising route but suffers from simultaneously utilizing electron/hole pairs which are limited to broad&#8208;band gap semiconductors. Herein, a half&#8208;photocathodic reaction strategy is demonstrated to activate and oxygenate C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds of toluene toward selective benzaldehyde production using a narrow&#8208;bandgap CuBi2O4 (CBO) porous photocathode. The intrinsic Cu+/Cu2+ redox of porous CBO photocathode catalyzes the photocathodic oxygen reductive H2O2 to generate &#183;OH capable of oxidation which activates the C(sp3)&#8208;H bond that is further oxygenated via &#183;O2&#8722; formed of the photocathodic oxygen reduction. As a result, the benzaldehyde selectivity is up to 90%. Impressively, the narrow&#8208;band gap of CBO enables record&#8208;high light&#8208;driven benzaldehyde yields of 111.93&#160;mmol&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 with stability of over 20 h. This work opens a green and efficient light&#8208;driven C(sp3)&#8208;H bond oxidation strategy by using a narrow&#8208;bandgap photocathode.

         <title>Doping Mo Triggers Charge Distribution Optimization and P Vacancy of Ni2P@Ni12P5 Heterojunction for Industrial Electrocatalytic Production of Adipic Acid and H2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 21, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust Mo&#8208;dopedNi2P@Ni12P5 heterojunction with rich P vacancies on Ni foam is proposed for accomplishing simultaneous electrooxidation of CHA to AA and HER at large current density with 85.7% yield of AA and 100% Faradaic efficiency of H2 production at 232&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Synergistic charge optimization and P vacancy by Mo Doping endows the enhanced bifunctional performances.








Abstract
Synchronous electrosynthesis of value&#8208;added adipic acid (AA) and H2 is extremely crucial for carbon neutrality. However, accomplishing the preparation of AA and H2 at large current density with high selectivity is still challenging. Herein, a robust Mo&#8208;doped Ni2P@Ni12P5 heterojunction with more P vacancies on Ni foam is proposed for accomplishing simultaneous electrooxidation of cyclohexanol (CHAOR) to AA and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)&#160;at large current density. Combined X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure, and electron spin resonance confirm that Mo incorporation induces the charge redistribution of Ni2P@Ni12P5, where Mo adjusts electrons from Ni to P, and triggers more P vacancies. Further experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the d&#8208;band center is upshifted, optimizing adsorption energies of water and hydrogen on electron&#8208;rich P site for boosting HER activity. Besides, more Ni3+ generated from electron&#8208;deficient Ni induced by Mo, alongside more OH* triggered from more P vacancies concurrently promote CHA dehydrogenation and C&#9472;C bond cleavage, decreasing energy barrier of CHAOR. Consequently, a two&#8208;electrode flow electrolyzer achieves industrial current density (&gt;230&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) with 85.7% AA yield, 100% Faradaic efficiency of H2 production. This study showcases an industrial bifunctional electrocatalyst for AA and H2 production with high productivity.

         <title>Modulating Active Center Microenvironment in Phthalocyanine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Electrocatalytic CO2 to CH3OH</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 21, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic cage with carboxyl groups in PEH&#8208;COF stabilized the [K(H2O)n]+ ions, which enhanced the PCET kinetics of the conversion for intermediates to methanol, and ultimately allows the PEH&#8208;COF to exhibit stable operation at a jCH3OH$\mathrm{j}_{{CH}_3OH}$ of &#8776;100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Developing catalysts for electrocatalytic CO2 to CH3OH still faces great challenge due to the involvement of multiple proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes. Molecular phthalocyanine electrocatalysts on carbon nanotubes have achieved production of methanol as the sole liquid&#8208;phase product but with the activity and stability far from meeting industrial demands. Herein, phthalocyaninato cobalt is fabricated into covalent organic frameworks PE&#8208;COF via polymerization with ellagic acid. Subsequent hydrolyzation of the ester groups in this framework affords COOH/OH&#8208;containing PEH&#8208;COF, resulting in the successful modulation over the local microenvironment of Co as electrochemical active center and in turn rendering the production of CH3OH with high yield and durability. Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that construction of the COOH group and H2O participated catalytic cages in PEH&#8208;COF can effectively fix hydrated potassium ions, which efficiently enhances the PCET kinetics and lowers the energy barriers for the conversion of CO2 to CH3OH. The partial current density (j) and Faraday efficiency of methanol for PEH&#8208;COF could reach 100.9&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 38.5%, respectively. Moreover, the jCH3OH$\mathrm{j}_{{CH}_3OH}$ of PEH&#8208;COF can be maintained at 100.4&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 after 9&#160;h of electrocatalysis, superior to the thus far reported catalysts.

         <title>Charge Polarization Tunable Interfaces for Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 21, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel interfacial chemical tuning strategy is proposed involving proton transfer between the amine of pyridoxamine (PM) and the phosphonic acid of Me&#8208;4PACz. This process enhances charge delocalization via electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged molecules, yielding a Me&#8208;4PACz&#8208;PM charge polarization interface that improves NiOx p&#8208;type conductivity, facilitates band alignment, and supports high&#8208;quality perovskite films, showcasing its commercial potential.








Abstract
Interfacial localized charges and interfacial losses from incompatible underlayers are critical factors limiting the efficiency improvement and market&#8208;integration of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a novel interfacial chemical tuning strategy is proposed involving proton transfer between the amine head of pyridoxamine (PM) and the phosphonic acid anchoring group of [4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)butyl]phosphonic acid (Me&#8208;4PACz), with simultaneous enhancement of charge delocalization through electrostatic attraction between opposite charged molecules. The Me&#8208;4PACz&#8208;PM charge polarization interface modulates the nickel oxide (NiOx) charge states and the coordination environment at buried interfaces, consequently enhancing p&#8208;type conductivity and obtaining a more compatible band arrangement. The high&#8208;coverage and wettability of the NiOx/Me&#8208;4PACz&#8208;PM underlayer also facilitate the deposition of high&#8208;quality perovskite films, releasing lattice strain and mitigating trap&#8208;assisted non&#8208;radiative recombination. Attributing to the implementation of charge polarization tunable interfaces, small&#8208;area devices and modules with an aperture area of 69 cm2 achieved impressive power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 26.34% (certified 25.48%) and 21.94% (certified 20.50%), respectively, and unencapsulated devices maintained their initial PCEs &#8776;90% after aging for 2000&#160;h (ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1) and 1500&#160;h (ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;1). The broad applicability of charge polarization tunable interfaces and the successful scaling of large&#8208;area modules provide a reference for expanding PSCs applications.

         <title>Rational Synthesis of Isomeric Graphdiyne Frameworks toward Single&#8208;Ruthenium Catalysts and High&#8208;Performance Nitrogen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 21, May 26, 2025. </description>

Isomeric graphdiyne frameworks with ThSi2 topology are synthesized from 2,2&#8242;&#8208;binaphthalene and 6,6&#8242;&#8208;biazulene&#8208;based isomeric monomers. The biazulene&#8208;based graphdiyne framework shows narrow bandgap of down to 1.15&#160;eV and can act as new platform for loading single metal atoms for high&#8208;performance electrocatalysis.








Abstract
Graphdiynes (GDYs), synthesized via direct coupling of arylacetylenes, have attracted great attention due to their unique electronic properties and structural diversity, typically forming 2D layered frameworks. However, crystalline GDY&#8208;like frameworks with 3D topology remain challenging to synthesize. Here, the study reports two highly crystalline, isomeric GDY&#8208;like frameworks with ThSi2 topology, constructed from 2,2&#8242;&#8208;binaphthalene and 6,6&#8242;&#8208;biazulene&#8208;based monomers. The azulene&#8208;based framework, due to its large dipole moment, exhibits a narrow bandgap of 1.15&#160;eV, significantly lower than its naphthalene counterpart (2.33&#160;eV). As ruthenium&#160;(Ru) single&#8208;atom supports, these frameworks enable strong Ru&#8208;diyne interactions, achieving an ammonia yield rate of 188.7 &#177;&#160;1.6&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 37.4 &#177;&#160;0.6%. Such bicontinuous channels and tunable electronic structures offer electrocatalysis field new opportunities. Moreover, the azulene&#8208;based framework, featuring a higher highest occupied molecular orbital&#160; and lower lowest unoccupied molecular orbital&#160; energy level, ensures superior electron mobility. These 3D crystalline frameworks introduce a new covalent organic framework (COF) family with diyne linkages and pure carbon skeletons, broadening the scope of COF materials. Their well&#8208;defined structures provide an ideal platform for tuning optoelectronic properties, enabling fundamental studies on structure&#8208;property relationships and opening new opportunities for catalytic and electronic applications.

         <title>Proton Reservoir in Covalent Organic Framework Compensating Oxygen Reduction Reaction Enhances Hydrogen Peroxide Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 21, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of hydroxyl groups (&#9472;OH) as a proton reservoir into the covalent organic framework (COF)&#160;can compensate oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and achieve a 3.3 times higher H2O2 photosynthetic activity than that of COF without &#9472;OH, which elucidates the favorability mechanisms of regulating the internal proton transfer of COF with proton reservoir in the accelerated ORR progress.









Abstract
The water oxidation reaction (WOR) with sluggish kinetics usually fails to adequately furnish protons to oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which ultimately constrains the overall efficiency of photocatalytic synthesis of H2O2, particularly in the absence of sacrificial agents. Herein, a class of hydroxyl groups (&#9472;OH) functionalized covalent organic framework (COF) is reported as a proton reservoir to compensate ORR for greatly improving the efficiency of H2O2 photosynthesis. It has been demonstrated that the incorporation of &#9472;OH into the TFBP&#8208;DHBD (TFBP: 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrakis&#8208;(4&#8208;formylphenyl)benzene, DHBD: 3,3&#8242;&#8208;dihydroxybenzidine) COF can achieve a 3.3 times higher H2O2 photosynthetic activity than that of TFBP&#8208;BD (BD: benzidine) COF without &#9472;OH groups. Isotope labeling experiments and in situ infrared spectroscopy analysis demonstrate that the proton reservoir can donate protons for ORR and subsequently regain the released protons from WOR. Theoretical calculations further confirm that the &#9472;OH functionalized COF provides the protons for the formation of *OOH intermediate and reduces its energy barrier, thereby facilitating the photosynthesis of H2O2. A novel COF loaded with Al2O3 spheres&#8208;based streamlined microreactor is built that can simultaneously achieve production of H2O2 and elimination of bacteria over 1.3&#160;&#215;&#160;104 CFU mL&#8722;1, superior to the reported continuous flow photocatalytic reactors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The water oxidation reaction (WOR) with sluggish kinetics usually fails to adequately furnish protons to oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which ultimately constrains the overall efficiency of photocatalytic synthesis of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, particularly in the absence of sacrificial agents. Herein, a class of hydroxyl groups (&#9472;OH) functionalized covalent organic framework (COF) is reported as a proton reservoir to compensate ORR for greatly improving the efficiency of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photosynthesis. It has been demonstrated that the incorporation of &#9472;OH into the TFBP-DHBD (TFBP: 1,2,4,5-tetrakis-(4-formylphenyl)benzene, DHBD: 3,3&#8242;-dihydroxybenzidine) COF can achieve a 3.3 times higher H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photosynthetic activity than that of TFBP-BD (BD: benzidine) COF without &#9472;OH groups. Isotope labeling experiments and in situ infrared spectroscopy analysis demonstrate that the proton reservoir can donate protons for ORR and subsequently regain the released protons from WOR. Theoretical calculations further confirm that the &#9472;OH functionalized COF provides the protons for the formation of *OOH intermediate and reduces its energy barrier, thereby facilitating the photosynthesis of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. A novel COF loaded with Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; spheres-based streamlined microreactor is built that can simultaneously achieve production of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and elimination of bacteria over 1.3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; CFU mL&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, superior to the reported continuous flow photocatalytic reactors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;polyphenol Multistage Competitive Coordination System for Colorimetric Monitoring Meat Freshness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 21, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research proposes a multistage competitive coordination chromogenic mechanism between metal&#8208;polyphenols and amines. Based on this, a metal&#8208;polyphenol network colorimetric sensor array (MPN&#8208;CSA) for real&#8208;time monitoring of meat freshness has been developed, achieving a detection rate of 99.83% through convolutional neural network technology. This sensitive, accurate, stable, eco&#8208;friendly, and economical solution can enhance food safety and reduce food waste.








Abstract
A low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;precision, and secure real&#8208;time system for monitoring food freshness can significantly improve spoilage issues, yet traditional colorimetric sensor arrays often suffer from chemical dyes&#8217; high toxicity and limited color changes. Here, a metal&#8208;polyphenol network colorimetric sensor array (MPN&#8208;CSA) is built for detecting total volatile base nitrogen (TVB&#8208;N) markers of meat freshness. The multi&#8208;level competitive coordination process between the metal&#8208;polyphenol system and amine substances endows the system with color changes far beyond those of traditional dyes (reaching a detection limit of 300 ppb). By integrating convolutional neural network (CNN) technology, an online platform is developed for monitoring meat freshness, achieving an overall detection accuracy rate of 99.83%. This environmentally friendly, economically viable MPN&#8208;CSA that monitors the freshness of meat in complex storage environments can be incorporated into food packaging boxes, enabling consumers and suppliers to assess the freshness of meat in real&#8208;time, thus helping to reduce food waste and prevent foodborne illnesses.

         <dc:description>
By proposing a single&#8208;cell order&#8208;decoupling method and simultaneously manipulating four&#8208;dimensional optical parameters (Wavelength, Wavevector Direction, Polarization, and Diffraction Order), a meta&#8208;optics storage system accomplishes multidimensional optical encryption. This system achieves up to sixteen&#8208;channel multidimensional encrypted holographic images with high quality and exponentially raises the threshold of brute&#8208;force decoding, and thus remarkably enhances information security in optical storage.









Abstract
Recent advancements in multidimensional multiplexing have paved the way for meta&#8208;optics encryption to be a viable solution to next&#8208;generation information storage and encryption security. However, challenges persist in increasing simultaneously modulated dimensions while minimizing structural complexity. Here, a novel single&#8208;cell order&#8208;decoupling method is proposed for the realization of a multidimensional encrypted meta&#8208;optics storage system. By analyzing the mathematic relationships between the phases of different diffraction orders, the detour phase structure is optimized to achieve independent encoding freedom for multiple orders. The proposed multidimensional encrypted meta&#8208;optics successfully realize the concurrent modulation of four optical dimensions: i) Wavelength, ii) Wavevector Direction, iii) Polarization, and iv) Diffraction Order. The system achieves up to sixteen&#8208;channel meta&#8208;holograms with low crosstalk and exponentially raises the threshold of brute&#8208;force decoding and thus remarkably enhances the information security in optical storage. It envisioned that the on&#8208;chip metasurface&#8208;based multidimensional encrypted strategy for augmented reality display functionalities presents promising applications in optical encryption/storage, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and multifunctional photonics integrated circuits.

Abstract
Metal halide perovskites and their derivatives have emerged as highly promising materials for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices, owing to their intrinsic defect tolerance and exceptional electrical and optical properties. Among these, lead&#8208;free copper(I)&#8208;based halide perovskite derivatives, Cs&#8323;Cu&#8322;X&#8325; (X = Cl, Br, I) (CHPs), have garnered significant attention as environmentally friendly and stable alternatives to lead&#8208;based perovskites. In this study, a cost&#8208;effective and sustainable synthesis route for Cs&#8323;Cu&#8322;Cl&#8325; and Cs&#8323;Cu&#8322;Br&#8325; powders is developed, which exhibit strong green (&#8776;526&#160;nm) and blue (&#8776;458&#160;nm) emissions, and achieve remarkable photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 100% and 92%, respectively. Cs&#8323;Cu&#8322;X&#8325; (X = Cl, Br) powders are incorporated into 3D&#8208;printed structures, exhibiting excellent transparency and color stability. Furthermore, white LEDs are fabricated by using the green&#8208;emitting Cs&#8323;Cu&#8322;Cl&#8325; and blue&#8208;emitting Cs&#8323;Cu&#8322;Br&#8325; and a yellow&#8208;emitting double perovskite (PLQY&#8776; 73%), resulting in devices with an exceptionally high color rendering index (CRI) of up to 98 and tunable correlated color temperatures (CCTs) ranging from 3864 to 9677 K, closely mimicking natural white light. Beyond solid&#8208;state lighting, the superior optical performance and stability of Cs&#8323;Cu&#8322;X&#8325; (X = Cl, Br) powders open new avenues for their application in photovoltaics and other optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Shortwave Infrared Light Detection and Ranging Using Silver Telluride Quantum Dots</title>

Post&#8208;synthesis surface engineering and doping control significantly improve the performance of Ag&#8322;Te CQD photodiodes, achieving a low dark current of 450 nA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.5 V, an LDR exceeding 150 dB, and a rapid response speed of &#8776;25 ns. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept LiDAR demonstration in the SWIR using a nanosecond diode laser, achieves decimetre&#8208;level resolution at a distance exceeding 10 m, paving the way in advancing SWIR CQDs toward consumer electronics and automotive markets.








Abstract
Shortwave infrared (SWIR) light, characterized as the &#8220;eye&#8208;safe&#8221; window, is considered extremely promising in various technological fields and particularly valuable for imaging and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) applications. Silver telluride (Ag2Te) colloidal quantum dots (CQDs), featuring RoHS&#8208;compliance, solution&#8208;processability, and CMOS compatibility, emerge as a potential contender for SWIR optoelectronics. Yet, further improvements in dark current, response speed, and linear dynamic range (LDR) are essential for meeting the rigorous demands of sensing and LiDAR applications. Here, it is shown that post&#8208;synthesis surface engineering and doping control significantly improve the dark current, response speed, and LDR of Ag&#8322;Te CQD photodiodes, achieving a low dark current of 450 nA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.5&#160;V, an LDR exceeding 150&#160;dB, and a rapid response speed of &#8776;25&#160;ns. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept LiDAR demonstration in the SWIR using a practical nanosecond diode laser achieves decimetre&#8208;level resolution at a distance exceeding 10 m. This work represents a key step in advancing SWIR CQDs toward consumer electronics and automotive markets.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortwave infrared (SWIR) light, characterized as the &#8220;eye-safe&#8221; window, is considered extremely promising in various technological fields and particularly valuable for imaging and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) applications. Silver telluride (Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te) colloidal quantum dots (CQDs), featuring RoHS-compliance, solution-processability, and CMOS compatibility, emerge as a potential contender for SWIR optoelectronics. Yet, further improvements in dark current, response speed, and linear dynamic range (LDR) are essential for meeting the rigorous demands of sensing and LiDAR applications. Here, it is shown that post-synthesis surface engineering and doping control significantly improve the dark current, response speed, and LDR of Ag&#8322;Te CQD photodiodes, achieving a low dark current of 450 nA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;0.5&#160;V, an LDR exceeding 150&#160;dB, and a rapid response speed of &#8776;25&#160;ns. A proof-of-concept LiDAR demonstration in the SWIR using a practical nanosecond diode laser achieves decimetre-level resolution at a distance exceeding 10 m. This work represents a key step in advancing SWIR CQDs toward consumer electronics and automotive markets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Highly Stable Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Electron Transport Layer for Ultraflexible Organic Photodiodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 21, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic photodiodes (OPDs) with low dark current and stable detectivity under light irradiation, air exposure, and heating are realized using a nanoparticle&#8208;based Zn&#8208;chelated PEIE (PEI&#8208;Zn NP) electron transport layer. This formulation effectively suppresses photocurrent degradation and dark current increase, ensuring enhanced environmental stability and maintained performance after 5000 cycles of device bending.








Abstract
Flexible organic photodiodes (OPDs) are used to detect light in system&#8208;scale demonstrations of skin&#8208;conformable devices. However, the detectivity of OPDs deteriorates under various environmental conditions, such as light irradiation, air exposure, and heating. This decrease in detectivity is observed in OPDs with a widely used sol&#8211;gel ZnO (ZnO SG) electron transport layer (ETL), where the dark current at the reverse bias increased by several orders of magnitude. In this study, a low dark current and stable detectivity with respect to the aforementioned external changes are achieved. The enhanced stability stems from the suppression of the increase in dark current realized by using a mixture of an organic polymer, polyethyleneimine (PEIE), and inorganic crystals (ZnO nanoparticles) to create a nanoparticle&#8208;based, Zn&#8208;chelated PEIE (PEI&#8208;Zn NP) as the ETL of the OPDs. The detectivities of OPDs with PEI&#8208;Zn NP are 89%, 84%, and 93% of their original values after light irradiation, air storage, and thermal heating, respectively. In contrast, their ZnO SG counterparts exhibited stabilities of only 9.9%, 55%, and 2.6%, respectively, in the same tests. Furthermore, the use of PEI&#8208;Zn NP ETL in ultraflexible OPDs is demonstrated by the maintained detectivity after 5000 cycles of device bending.

         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;sorting assembly mediated supramolecular nanoformulations are reported, featured by molecularly defined medicines and enhanced therapeutics. Specific &#8216;hydrogen&#8208;bonding molecular instructions&#8217; encoded in the structure of DAP/FU and HW/Ba pairs enables self&#8208;sorting phenomena and selective association of multiple prodrugs. Moreover, distinct association constant of DAP/FU (&#8776;102 M&#8722;1) and HW/Ba (&#8776;104&#8208;5 M&#8722;1) pairs endow programmable dissociation and specific chemo&#8208;prodrug release through pH/thermal&#8208;stimuli.








Abstract
Precise cancer nanomedicine requires rational molecular instructions of therapeutic agents. Harnessing the structure&#8208;property&#8208;function relationships represents a practical strategy toward smart and effective nanomedicine. A structurally novel hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) supramolecular nanoformulation generated by orthogonal self&#8208;sorting assembly of chemo&#8208;prodrug (FPtF) and phototherapeutics (BPeB) is here reported, to reach an autonomous nanomedicine with improved anti&#8208;tumor efficacy by combining chemo/phototherapy (CT/PT). The high&#8208;fidelity of H&#8208;bonding modularity from privileged heterocomplementary diaminopyridine/5&#8208;fluorouracil (DAP/FU) and Hamilton wedge/barbiturate (HW/Ba) pairs, respectively enable the precise spatial control of binding interactions toward FPtF and BPeB, in turn allowing the self&#8208;sorting process and specific &#8220;mix&#8208;and&#8208;match&#8221; capability. To directly stimulate phototherapy from BPeB via near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light, spectral matched upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs, &#946;&#8208;NaYF4:Yb,Er) are encapsulated simultaneously. As a result, supramolecular polymeric nanomicelles, i.e., F/B/U@PHDO, are readily fabricated. Moreover, distinct H&#8208;bonding association constant (Ka) of DAP/FU (&#8776;102&#160;M&#8722;1) and HW/Ba (&#8776;104&#8208;5&#160;M&#8722;1) pairs reflect different strengths and stabilities of H&#8208;bonds, thus endowing the programmable H&#8208;bonding dissociation, accompanied with the chemo&#8208;prodrug release through pH/thermal&#8208;stimuli. Therapeutic regime with appreciated anti&#8208;tumor outcomes is ultimately accomplished via combined CT/PT. The privileged opportunities offered by self&#8208;sorting design are anticipated to point to new paradigm toward precise nanomedicine for cancer therapy.

         <title>High&#8208;Yield Bioproduction of Extracellular Vesicles from Stem Cell Spheroids via Millifluidic Vortex Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stem cell spheroids, produced via a high&#8208;throughput microfabrication technique, are transported within a vortex generated at the outlet channels of a cross&#8208;slot millifluidic chip. For Reynolds number exceeding 170&#8211;200, intermittent high shear stresses applied to each spheroid within the vortex trigger a massive release of biologically active extracellular vesicles.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are emerging as novel therapeutics, particularly in cancer and degenerative diseases. Nevertheless, from both market and clinical viewpoints, high&#8208;yield production methods using minimal cell materials are still needed. Herein, a millifluidic cross&#8208;slot chip is proposed to induce high&#8208;yield release of biologically active EVs from less than three million cells. Depending on the flow rate, a single vortex forms in the outlet channels, exposing transported cellular material to high viscous stresses. Importantly, the chip accommodates producer cells within their physiological environment, such as human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) spheroids, while facilitating their visualization and individual tracking within the vortex. This precise control of viscous stresses at the spheroid level allows for the release of up to 30000 EVs per cell at a Reynolds number of &#8776;400, without compromising cellular integrity. Additionally, it reveals a threshold initiating EV production, providing evidence for a stress&#8208;dependent mechanism governing vesicle secretion. EVs mass&#8208;produced at high Reynolds displayed pro&#8208;angiogenic and wound healing capabilities, as confirmed by proteomic and cytometric analysis of their cargo. These distinct molecular signatures of these EVs, compared to those derived from monolayers, underscore the critical roles of the production method and the 3D cellular environment in EV generation.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Hollow Gyroids with Bicontinuous Mesostructures: A Highly Robust Electrocatalyst Fixation Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hollow gyroid carbon (HGC), synthesized via the self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers and vapor pressure&#8208;induced hollow structuring, provides a robust platform for embedding Pt nanoparticles. The HGC morphology facilitates efficient mass transport while the pyridine N inherent in the block copolymer enhances electrical conductivity and electrochemical durability, leading to outstanding performance in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells.








Abstract
The electrochemical degradation of Pt/C in commercial proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) is a major challenge that limits their durability and performance. This degradation mainly arises from carbon corrosion, which facilitates the detachment of electrocatalyst particles that are weakly bound to catalyst supports. Herein, unusually robust hollow gyroid morphologies designed for strong electrocatalyst fixation and extensive surface accessibility during oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) are reported. To obtain self&#8208;assembled gyroid nanostructures using a poly(styrene&#8208;b&#8208;2&#8208;vinylpyridine) (PS&#8208;b&#8208;P2VP) block copolymer, a solvent vapour treatment with dimethylformamide, which is highly selective for the P2VP block, is applied. It is discovered that retaining residual solvent in the gyroid&#8208;forming P2VP microdomain before carbonization is crucial for forming hollow gyroids with embedded electrocatalysts. These hollow gyroid carbon&#8208;Pt (HGC&#8208;Pt) nanostructures exhibit a 3.6&#8208;fold enhancement in electrochemically active surface area compared to solid gyroid carbon (SGC) counterparts. Based on systematic analyses, this exceptional electrochemical stability is attributed to greatly enhanced surface accessibility derived from the hollow geometry, uniform and robust catalyst embedding, and extensive pyridinic nitrogen doping from the P2VP block.

The HGC morphology facilitates efficient mass transport while the pyridine N inherent in the block copolymer enhances electrical conductivity and electrochemical durability, leading to outstanding performance in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrochemical degradation of Pt/C in commercial proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) is a major challenge that limits their durability and performance. This degradation mainly arises from carbon corrosion, which facilitates the detachment of electrocatalyst particles that are weakly bound to catalyst supports. Herein, unusually robust hollow gyroid morphologies designed for strong electrocatalyst fixation and extensive surface accessibility during oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) are reported. To obtain self-assembled gyroid nanostructures using a poly(styrene-b-2-vinylpyridine) (PS-b-P2VP) block copolymer, a solvent vapour treatment with dimethylformamide, which is highly selective for the P2VP block, is applied. It is discovered that retaining residual solvent in the gyroid-forming P2VP microdomain before carbonization is crucial for forming hollow gyroids with embedded electrocatalysts. These hollow gyroid carbon-Pt (HGC-Pt) nanostructures exhibit a 3.6-fold enhancement in electrochemically active surface area compared to solid gyroid carbon (SGC) counterparts. Based on systematic analyses, this exceptional electrochemical stability is attributed to greatly enhanced surface accessibility derived from the hollow geometry, uniform and robust catalyst embedding, and extensive pyridinic nitrogen doping from the P2VP block.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Tracking InOx/m&#8208;ZrO2 Dynamics for Green Methanol
This study combines in situ transmission electron microscopy with automated, machine&#8208;learning&#8208;based difference imaging to classify and rank the dynamic behavior of supported indium oxide species during CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. The results reveal that partially reduced InOx species on monoclinic zirconia undergo a cyclic mechanism involving migration, growth, reversible coalescence, and dispersion, explaining the high stability observed on this support. These insights provide a new perspective on catalyst dynamics, paving the way for more rational, data&#8208;informed catalyst design strategies. More details can be found in article number 2419859 by P&#233;rez&#8208;Ram&#237;rez and co&#8208;workers.

Hydrogel&#8208;Impregnated Robust Interlocking Nano Connector
In article number 2414944, Jung&#8208;Hoon Park, Joonseok Lee, and colleagues present a robust esophageal stent migration prevention system called hydrogel&#8208;impregnated robust interlocking nano connector (HiRINC), featuring a jigsaw puzzle&#8208;shaped porous layer synthesized on the stent surface. These structures enhance interfacial adhesion with hydrogel by inducing mechanical interlocking and energy dissipation during peristalsis, thereby improving stent anchorage to esophageal tissues.

Sodium solid&#8208;state batteries (SSSBs) overcome lithium's sustainability limitations (2.36% vs 0.0017% crustal abundance). Perovskite/anti&#8208;perovskite solid electrolytes (SEs) with high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity and tunable structures are promising, where anti&#8208;perovskites excel in multi&#8208;dimensional ion channels and interfacial stability. This review highlights conductive optimization (doping, defect engineering), electrochemical stability mechanisms, and proposes a structural&#8208;tolerance&#8208;factor&#8208;based evaluation framework. Future priorities include controllable synthesis and enhanced interface compatibility.








Abstract
Sodium solid&#8208;state batteries (SSSBs) are poised to revolutionize energy storage by capitalizing on sodium's exceptional crustal abundance (2.36% vs 0.0017% for lithium) and cost&#8208;effectiveness, addressing critical sustainability challenges of lithium&#8208;dependent technologies. Solid electrolytes (SEs) with high ionic conductivity and stability have gained significant attention. The compositional and structural flexibility of perovskites and anti&#8208;perovskites make them competitive, and the combination of advanced computer simulations and synthesis techniques can achieve stable synthesis of the materials. Importantly, the high ionic conductivity and high stability of perovskite and anti&#8208;perovskite SEs at room temperature endow them with enormous potential for the construction of SSSBs. In this review, the research progress of perovskite and anti&#8208;perovskite SEs for SSSBs is summarized, different optimization strategies for improving the ionic conductivity of SEs are compared, and an in&#8208;depth discussion on the chemical and electrochemical stability of SEs is provided. Specifically, key technical indicators reflecting their structural tolerance and future application potential have been summarized and discussed for the first time. Among these, anti&#8208;perovskites, due to their diversity and the presence of more ion transport channels, have the potential to become commercial SEs. Finally, the future challenges and development directions of perovskite and anti&#8208;perovskite SEs for SSSBs have been prospected.

         <title>Synthesis of Intrinsic Magnetic Topological Insulator MnBi2nTe3n+1 Family by Chemical Vapor Transport Method with Feedback Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modified chemical vapor transport method incorporating a feedback&#8208;regulated strategy provides closed&#8208;loop control of the growth temperature of MnBi2nTe3n+1 family within &#177; 0.1&#160;&#176;C, which reveals rich magnetic tunability, such as varying antiferromagnetic coupling in MnBi2Te4 and inducing magnetic ground state transitions from antiferromagnetism to ferromagnetism in MnBi4Te7 and MnBi6Te10.








Abstract
MnBi2nTe3n+1 is a representative family of intrinsic magnetic topological insulators, in which numerous exotic phenomena such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect are expected. The high&#8208;quality crystal growth and magnetism manipulation are the most essential processes. Here a modified chemical vapor transport method using a feedback&#8208;regulated strategy is developed, which provides the closed&#8208;loop control of growth temperature within &#177;&#160;0.1&#160;&#176;C. Single crystals of MnBi2Te4, MnBi4Te7, and MnBi6Te10 are obtained under different temperature intervals respectively, and show variable tunability on magnetism by finely tuning the growth temperatures. Specifically, the cold&#8208;end temperatures not only vary the strength of antiferromagnetic coupling in MnBi2Te4, but also induce magnetic ground state transitions from antiferromagnetism to ferromagnetism in MnBi4Te7 and MnBi6Te10. In MnBi2Te4 with optimized magnetism, quantized transport with Chern insulator state can be easily replicated. These results provide a systematic picture for the crystal growth and the rich magnetic tunability of MnBi2nTe3n+1 family, providing richer platforms for the related researches combining magnetism and topological physics.

         <title>Morphogenic Growth 3D Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
I additive manufacturing process exploits the spatial propagation of a polymerization reaction front to produce 3D polymer parts 10&#215; faster and 1000&#215; more energy efficient &#160;than the fastest stereolithography. In contrast with existing 3D printing, this morphogenic process is inspired by biological &#8220;growth and form&#8221; due to the self&#8208;directed propagation of the reaction.








Abstract
Inspired by nature's morphogenesis, a new 3D printing process &#8211;growth printing (GP)&#8211; takes advantage of a self&#8208;propagating curing front to produce 3D polymeric parts following a growth&#8208;like development plan. The propagation of the curing front is driven by the exothermic polymerization of dicyclopentadiene (DCPD), which transforms the liquid resin into a stiff polymer as it propagates at 1 mm s&#8722;1. GP is triggered when a heated initiator contacts the uncured liquid resin in an open container. The initiator nucleates the frontal polymerization reaction and the isotropic radial propagation of the growth front. Simultaneously, the initiator is moved up across the free surface of the resin, pulling the cured object out of the uncured resin. The motion trajectory of the initiator with respect to the free resin surface controls the growth morphology of the 3D part. An inverse design algorithm is developed to produce 3D parts by modeling the reaction&#8208;diffusion&#8208;driven solidification process. This process has substantial energy savings and high printing&#160;speeds.

         <title>Harnessing Near&#8208;Infrared Light for Enhanced Solar Hydrogen Production from Escherichia coli Interfaced with Biocompatible Low&#8208;Bandgap Conjugated Polymer Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocompatible, low&#8208;bandgap conjugated polymer nanosheets are interfaced with non&#8208;photosynthetic and non&#8208;genetic engineered Escherichia coli for solar hydrogen production using near&#8208;infrared light. The rationally designed polymer nanosheets play a crucial role in harnessing the broad solar spectrum and injecting photo&#8208;generated electrons into bacteria, thereby enhancing hydrogen production.








Abstract
The efficient conversion of solar energy into clean hydrogen fuel presents a promising pathway for sustainable energy production. However, utilizing the full solar spectrum, particularly the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region, remains underexplored in photosynthetic biohybrid systems. In this study, biocompatible, low&#8208;bandgap conjugated polymer nanosheets (PyTT&#8208;tBAL&#8208;HAB) are developed to integrate with non&#8208;photosynthetic, non&#8208;genetically engineered Escherichia coli (E. coli) for enhanced solar&#8208;driven biological hydrogen production. The PyTT&#8208;tBAL&#8208;HAB nanosheets exhibit unique NIR light absorption properties. Integrating these nanosheets with E. coli facilitates efficient electron transfer, resulting in a 1.96&#8208;fold increase in hydrogen production rate under NIR light. Consequently, this photosynthetic biohybrid system achieves a quantum efficiency of 18.36% at 940&#160;nm. This study demonstrates the potential of using low&#8208;bandgap conjugated polymer nanosheets as advanced photosensitizers in semi&#8208;artificial photosynthetic systems, offering a robust platform for the effective utilization of the solar spectrum.

         <title>Unlocking the Potential of Oxide&#8208;Based Catalysts for CO2 Photo&#8208;Hydrogenation: Oxygen Vacancies Promoted C&#9472;O Bond Cleavage in Key Intermediates</title>

Structure&#8208;tailored Co3O4 is employed to investigate how oxygen vacancies perform during CO2 (photo&#8208;)methanation, revealing that oxygen vacancies boost the C&#9472;O bond scission, facilitating conversion of various oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates. Notably, the C&#9472;O bond cleavage in key intermediate formate, identified as the rate&#8208;limiting step, is accelerated on oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich M&#8208;Co3O4, leading to a high activity and selectivity in CH4 production.








Abstract
Oxygen vacancies are generally recognized to play significant roles in CO2 adsorption and activation during CO2 hydrogenation. However, by revisiting its structural/electronic affinity for a range of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates in CO2 hydrogenation processes, the additional roles of oxygen vacancies can be long overlooked and underestimated. Herein, using CO2 (photo&#8208;)methanation as a model reaction, Co3O4 with abundant oxygen vacancies is employed to investigate the relationship between oxygen vacancies and the formation/conversion of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates. Combined analyses of in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the key intermediate is formate, whose C&#9472;O bond cleavage is inferred to be the rate&#8208;limiting step during CO2 methanation on Co3O4. Remarkably, leveraging the oxygen vacancy&#8208;mediated C&#9472;O bond scission to accelerate the conversion of formate, the CH4 production activity (1108.1&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and selectivity (93%) are improved significantly. This comprehensive study provides valuable insights into the multifaceted roles of oxygen vacancies in CO2 hydrogenation reactions, establishing a solid foundation toward the design and development of high&#8208;performance oxide&#8208;containing/&#8208;based catalysts for the conversion of CO2 into various valuable chemicals.

         <title>TOP&#8208;Zn Steric Hindrance Effect Enables Ultra&#8208;Uniform CsPbX3 Quantum Dots for Wide&#8208;Color Gamut Displays</title>

Ligand&#8208;ion (TOP&#8208;Zn) complex&#8208;modulating nucleation strategy is applied to depress spectral broadening. This strategy is confirmed to work in blue/green/red PQDs, achieving record&#8208;breaking narrowed spectral FWHMs (15, 17, and 25 nm respectively). These PQDs realize a wide color gamut coverage of &#8776;130% NTSC and &#8776;100% Rec. 2020 standard. Meanwhile, pure&#8208;red PeLED exhibits a high EQE of exceeding 20%.








Abstract
Perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) are expected to be an ideal candidate for wide&#8208;color gamut displays owing to their high color purity. However, their color purity is challenged by remarkable spectral broadening due to non&#8208;uniform size distribution and crystal defects. Here, a ligand&#8208;ion (TOP&#8208;Zn) complex&#8208;modulating nucleation strategy is proposed to depress spectral broadening. This is achieved by enhancing the steric hindrance effect during lead&#8208;halogen octahedral assembly and reducing the reaction activity/sites of the system. This strategy is universal and has been confirmed to be effective for blue, green, and red PQDs, achieving narrowed spectral full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 15, 17, and 25&#160;nm, respectively. These FWHMs are record&#8208;breaking and contribute to a wide color gamut coverage of &#8776;130% National Television Standards Committee and &#8776;100% Rec. 2020 standard. Meanwhile, these PQD&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) exhibit a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of exceeding 20% at their pure color range. These results provide a feasible path to achieve ultra&#8208;uniform and pure&#8208;color luminescent PQDs for wide&#8208;color gamut displays.

         <title>Molecular Engineering Enables Bright Carbon Dots for Super&#8208;Resolution Fluorescence Imaging and In Vivo Optogenetics</title>

Intrinsic, deep defective and surface states are proved in CDs. Hydrogen bonding (HB) is found to be detrimental to surface state emission of CDs through non&#8208;radiative decay pathway, while polarization promoted the surface state emission in a single decay pathway. By eliminating HB and promoting polarization&#8208;induced charge transfer, engineered CDs with fluorescence QY up to 98.1% are synthesized and applied for various applications.








Abstract
Improving the fluorescence quantum yield (QY) of carbon dots (CDs) is essential for expanding their applications. Understanding the photoluminescence mechanism of CDs can provide valuable insights for QY improvement. In this study, it is demonstrated that polarization facilitated the surface state emission of CDs through a single decay pathway, while hydrogen bonding (HB) is identified as a factor that hindered the surface state emission of CDs through non&#8208;radiative decay. Following an in&#8208;depth evaluation of these mechanisms, the QY of CDs is markedly enhanced by engineering molecules onto their surfaces. This strategy not only eliminated HB but also promoted polarization&#8208;induced charge transfer. Notably, the QY of the yellow&#8208;emitting CD is elevated to 98.1%. Capitalizing on their long&#8208;term stability, excellent water solubility, two&#8208;photon excitation capacity, and non&#8208;toxicity, the engineered CDs are successfully applied in dual&#8208;color super&#8208;resolution fluorescence imaging in living cells, two&#8208;photon imaging of zebrafish, and optogenetic regulation in the deep brain of freely&#8208;moving animals.

         <title>From Molecule to Aggregate: Designing AIE Nanocrystals for Low&#8208;Power Backward Third&#8208;Harmonic Generation Angiography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic BTHG agent called OTBP with prominent crystallinity is developed. The resonant absorption at 433&#160;nm and prominent crystallinity of OTBP enhance its BTHG efficiency when excited by a 1300 nm femtosecond laser. Tuning the size of OTBP nanocrystals based on Mie scattering theory successfully enables them to achieve high&#8208;contrast muti&#8208;organ angiography with ultra&#8208;low pulse energy (100 pJ) and thereby negligible photodamage risk.








Abstract
Organic materials featuring third harmonic generation (THG) hold great promise for deep&#8208;tissue bioimaging due to their good biocompatibility and second near&#8208;infrared excitation. However, minimizing photodamage from the incident light necessitates significant improvements in the third&#8208;order nonlinear susceptibility. Herein, an organic luminogen called OTBP is developed as a backward THG (BTHG) contrast agent for second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II)&#160;angiography. OTBP's intense absorption at 433&#160;nm resonantly enhances its BTHG efficiency when excited by a 1300 nm femtosecond laser. In the aggregate state, the robust intermolecular interactions among OTBP molecules realize excellent crystallinity and the facile preparation of nanocrystals (NCs) with a high refractive index of 1.78. By leveraging Mie scattering theory, the best size of OTBP NCs for BTHG collection is attained. These integrated properties result in a high BTHG efficiency of OTBP NCs. Encapsulating the NCs with F&#8208;127 enables ultralow&#8208;power but high&#8208;contrast 3D vasculature imaging with negligible photodamage and background interference. Further elevating the laser power to 60&#160;mW enables the visualization of microvessels at 500&#160;&#181;m with a high SNR of 143. This study offers insights into material design strategies toward efficient organic BTHG contrast agents and paves the way for the materials&#8208;oriented non&#8208;linear optics.

Robust 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper lead&#8208;tin perovskites demonstrate exceptional resistive switching memory performance after cesium carbonate deposition, achieving a high accuracy of 90.1% in MNIST pattern recognition. Additionally, a novel energy&#8208;efficient content&#8208;addressable memory architecture, based on perovskite memristive devices, is proposed for neuromorphic applications, demonstrating ultralow energy consumption of &#8776;0.025 fJ&#160;bit&#8722;1 per cell.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites have drawn great attention for neuromorphic electronic devices in recent years, however, the toxicity of lead as well as the variability and energy consumption of operational devices still pose great challenges for further consideration of this material in neuromorphic computing applications. Here, a 2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (RP) metal halides system of formulation BA2Pb0.5Sn0.5I4 (BA = n&#8208;butylammonium) is prepared that exhibits outstanding resistive switching memory performance after cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3) deposition. In particular, the device exhibits excellent switching characteristics (endurance of 5 &#215; 105 cycles, ON/OFF ratio &#8776;105) and achieves 90.1% accuracy on the MNIST dataset. More importantly, a novel energy&#8208;efficient content addressable memory (CAM) architecture building on perovskite memristive devices for neuromorphic applications, called nCAM, is proposed, which has a minimum energy consumption of &#8776;0.025 fJ&#160;bit/cell. A mechanism involving the manipulation of trapping states through Cs2CO3 deposition is proposed to explain the resistive switching behavior of the memristive device.

         <title>Tailoring Synergistic Ion Environment for Copper Telluride toward High&#8208;Capacity and Ultrastable Acidic Multivalent&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>

Cu2&#8208;xTe electrodes are disclosed in acidic multivalent&#8208;ion batteries for the first time to achieve a high capacity of up to 409 mAh g&#8722;1 and a long cycling lifespan of 40&#8201;000 cycles. Composite in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements and spectroscopic analyses show that the synergistic copper&#8208;ion/proton electrolyte environment ensures stable reversible storage of copper&#8208;ions and prevents potential material oxidation.








Abstract
Acidic batteries permit a reliable energy supply at low temperatures with low cost and intrinsic safety, yet the development of stable acid&#8208;resistant electrodes with high capacity and a reliable lifespan is still challenging. Herein, nonstoichiometric copper telluride (Cu2&#8208;xTe) nanosheets are first explored as high&#8208;performance electrodes for acidic batteries to provide a stable capacity release of 409 mAh g&#8722;1 with a record&#8208;breaking lifespan of 40&#160;000 cycles and excellent kinetics, enabling operation at a high current density of 20 A g&#8722;1. In contrast to the inherent perception of corrosive destruction of electrode materials by strongly acidic environments, the electrolyte environment enriched with copper ions and hydrogen ions synergistically stabilizes the Cu2&#8208;xTe electrode and drives reversible multielectron transfer asymmetric deep conversion, which is confirmed by in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, first&#8208;principal calculations, and composite electrochemical characterization. Therefore, Cu2&#8208;xTe provides an impressive accumulation capacity of over 4764 Ah g&#8722;1, exceeding that of most acidic batteries, and works well at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C. High&#8208;performance Cu2&#8208;xTe electrodes also promote the establishment of Cu2&#8208;xTe//Mn2O3 and Cu2&#8208;xTe//Fe acidic full cells enabling stable operation at room temperature and low temperature, offering promising opportunities for electrode progress in advanced acidic batteries.

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Impregnated Robust Interlocking Nano Connector (HiRINC) for Noninvasive Anti&#8208;Migration of Esophageal Stent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of hydrogel&#8208;impregnated robust interlocking nano connector (HiRINC) aims to address stent migration by improving tissue adhesion and reducing mechanical mismatch in self&#8208;expandable metallic stents (SEMSs). The network&#8208;like porous layer of HiRINC enhances adhesion and energy dissipation, demonstrates through ex vivo and in vivo tests, effectively preventing migration in esophageal models.








Abstract
Migration of implanted self&#8208;expandable metallic stent (SEMS) in the malignant or benign esophageal stricture is a common complication but not yet resolved. Herein, this research develops a hydrogel&#8208;impregnated robust interlocking nano connector (HiRINC) to ensure adhesion and reduce the mechanical mismatch between SEMSs and esophageal tissues. Featuring a network&#8208;like porous layer, HiRINC significantly enhances adhesion and energy dissipation during esophageal peristalsis by utilizing mechanical interlocking and increasing hydrogen bonding sites, thereby securing SEMS to tissues. The anti&#8208;swelling property of HiRINC prevents excessive hydrogel expansion, avoiding esophageal blockage. Ex vivo and in vivo adhesion tests confirm that the HiRINC outperforms flat surfaces without RINC structures and effectively prevents stent migration. HiRINC&#8208;coated SEMS maintains its position and luminal patency, minimizing stent&#8208;induced tissue hyperplasia and inflammatory responses in rat and porcine esophageal models during the 4&#8208;week follow&#8208;up. This novel HiRINC&#8208;SEMS can ensure anti&#8208;migration and prolonged stent patency in the rat and porcine esophagus and seems to be expanded to other nonvascular luminal organs and various implantable metallic devices.

         <title>Dielectric&#8208;Tailored Space Charge Layer and Ion Coordination Structure for High&#8208;Voltage Polymer All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel composite solid&#8208;state polymer electrolyte incorporated dielectric BaTiO3 nanofillers (PDB) for advanced high&#8208;voltage all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. The design achieves a tailored coordination structure, diminished space charge layer, improved ion transport, and enhanced oxidative stability, making this approach a promising strategy for practical long&#8208;cycling all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.








Abstract
The poor structural stability of polymer electrolytes and sluggish ion transport kinetics of interfaces with cathode limit the fundamental performance improvements of polymer all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries under high voltages. Herein, it is revealed that by introducing dielectric BaTiO3 in an in&#8208;situ polymerized composite solid&#8208;state electrolyte, the generated interaction between the ether group of polymer electrolyte and dielectric material could effectively regulate the lithium&#8208;ion (Li+) coordination structure to achieve an oxidative potential higher than 5.2&#160;V. The dielectric BaTiO3 with spontaneous polarization also weakens the space charge layer effect between the cathode and electrolyte, facilitating fast Li+ transport kinetics across the cathode/electrolyte interfaces. The all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/Li batteries with the dielectric composite solid&#8208;state electrolyte exhibit an ultra&#8208;long cycling life of 1800 and 1300 cycles at room temperature under high cut&#8208;off voltages of 4.6 and 4.7&#160;V, respectively. This work highlights the critical role of dielectric materials in high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state electrolytes and provides a promising strategy to realize high&#8208;voltage long&#8208;life all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Implanted Magnetoelectric Bionic Cartilage Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
VAFe bionic cartilage hydrogel with a double&#8208;network semi&#8208;crosslinked chain entanglement structure and motion&#8208;driven magnetoelectric&#8208;coupled cyclic transformation effect shows the high water content, a porous structure, good mechanical properties, and the electromagnetic effect of the bionic cartilage, which provides a functional compensation and a suitable induced environment for the defective cartilage repair.








Abstract
Enhancing defective cartilage repair by creating a bionic cartilage hydrogel supplemented with in situ electromagnetic stimulation, replicating endogenous electromagnetic effects, remains challenging. To achieve this, a unique three&#8208;phase solvent system is designed to prepare a magnetoelectric bionic cartilage hydrogel incorporating piezoelectric poly(3&#8208;hydroxybutyric acid&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxyvaleric acid) (PHBV) and magnetostrictive triiron tetraoxide nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs) into sodium alginate (SA) hydrogel to form a dual&#8208;network, semi&#8208;crosslinked chain entanglement structure. The synthesized hydrogel features similar composition, structure, and mechanical properties to natural cartilage. In addition, after the implantation of cartilage, the motion&#8208;driven magnetoelectric&#8208;coupled cyclic transformation model is triggered by gentle joint forces, initiating a piezoelectric response that leads to magnetoelectric&#8208;coupled cyclic transformation. The freely excitable and cyclically enhanced electromagnetic stimulation it can provide, by simulating and amplifying endogenous electromagnetic effects, obtains induced defective cartilage repair efficacy superior to piezoelectric or magnetic stimulation alone.

         <title>Mechanical Robust Nacre&#8208;Mimetic Composites with Designable Cryptic Coloration and Electromagnetic Wave&#8208;Transparent Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nacre&#8208;mimetic ceramic&#8208;polymer structural material is developed by a dual&#8208;oxide interface design strategy, achieving high mechanical properties, tunable colors and superior EM wave&#8208;transparent performance. These characteristics make it hold great potential as a protective material for radar and communication equipment.








Abstract
Ceramic materials are widely used in various protective equipment owing to their excellent mechanical properties and chemical stability, while their applications are limited by monotonous color and poor toughness. Inspired by the colorful and tough natural shells, nacre&#8208;mimetic alumina (Al2O3)&#8208;based (NMA) composites are fabricated by proposing a dual&#8208;oxide interface design strategy inspired by&#160;the hierarchical structure of natural nacre. The NMA composites achieve color regulation, providing possibilities for their application in camouflage protective armor. The fracture toughness of the optimal NMA composite is more than three times that of commercial Al2O3 ceramic. Simultaneously, the NMA composites have obvious advantages in terms of impact resistance compared with Al2O3 ceramic and polymer polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). Additionally, the hierarchical structure of the NMA composites provides favorable structural conditions for transmission of electromagnetic (EM) waves at the frequency band of 18&#8211;26.5&#160;GHz. These characteristics make the NMA composites potential protective materials for radar and communication equipment.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Sheet Shape Transformation by Internally&#8208;Driven, Oriented Forces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is implemented to embed dermal fibroblasts in collagen&#160;in contact with anisotropic hydrogel fibers. Fibroblasts generate traction forces and remodel the collagen matrix, following the alignment cues of the hydrogel template. The orientational order is transferred to the fibroblasts, inducing collective alignment. Cell alignment generates internally driven, oriented forces that ultimately lead to programmed 2D and 3D shape changes of the cell&#8208;laden collagen matrices, such as&#160;transforming from square to diamond, or from flat to dome. This approach provides insights into the role of topological defects in morphogenesis and advances new techniques for developing shape&#8208;morphing materials with programmable forces.








Abstract
During morphogenesis, cells collectively execute directional forces that drive the programmed folding and growth of the layers, forming tissues and organs. The ability to recapitulate aspects of these processes in&#160; vitro will constitute a significant leap forward in the field of tissue engineering. Free&#8208;standing, self&#8208;organizing, cell&#8208;laden matrices are fabricated using a sequential deposition approach that uses liquid crystal&#8208;templated hydrogel fibers to direct cell arrangements. The orientation of hydrogel fibers is controlled using flow or boundary cues, while their microstructures are controlled by depletion interaction and probed by scattering and microscopy. These fibers effectively direct cells embedded in a collagen matrix, creating multilayer structures through contact guidance and by leveraging steric interactions amongst the cells. In uniformly aligned cell matrices, oriented cells exert traction forces that can induce preferential contraction of the matrix. Simultaneously, the matrix densifies and develops anisotropy through cell remodeling. Such an approach can be extended to create cell arrangements with arbitrary in&#8208;plane patterns, allowing for coordinated cell forces and pre&#8208;programmed, macroscopic shape changes. This work reveals a fundamentally new path for controlled force generation, emphasizing the role of a carefully designed initial orientational field for manipulating shape transformations of reconstituted&#160;matrices.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Doped P'2 Mn&#8208;Based Layered Oxide with Superior Stability and High Capacity for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>

High&#8208;entropy doped P'2&#8208;Na0.59Mn0.90Ti0.02Cu0.02Ni0.02Co0.02Fe0.02O1.95F0.05 layered oxide cathode material associated with P'2&#8208;OP4 bi&#8208;phase transition yields superior cyclability (97.8% over 100 cycles) in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The high&#8208;entropy doping can effectively regulate the energy level splitting of the eg* orbital and crystal fields, thus mitigating the Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion while maintaining the TMO6 octahedra anisotropy.








Abstract
P'2&#8208;NaxMnO2 (NMO) features an ultra&#8208;high specific capacity in sodium&#8208;ion batteries, which, however, suffers from a fast capacity decay. To improve the stability, a high&#8208;entropy doped P'2&#8208;Na0.59Mn0.90Ti0.02Cu0.02Ni0.02Co0.02Fe0.02O1.95F0.05 (NMHE0.1OF) is developed to lessen the Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion and address the multiple phase transition issue. Physicochemical characterizations reveal that the NMHE0.1OF yields a lower anisotropy in the Mn&#9472;O bond than does the undoped NMO. Theoretical calculations indicate that the cation doping enhances the coordination ability of oxygen and the F doping breaks the electronic symmetry of Mn. The in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction result reveals that the NMO experiences a more abrupt and irreversible OP4&#8208;P'2&#8208;P&#8243;2 tri&#8208;phase transition; and the NMHE0.1OF features a mild and reversible OP4&#8208;P'2 bi&#8208;phase transition, which originates from the alleviation in the contraction/expansion of the transition metal slabs evidenced by ex situ extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure. The bi&#8208;phase transition favors the compatibility between the NMHE0.1OF and the ether&#8208;based electrolyte at high voltages. As a result, the NMHE0.1OF yields a superior cyclability (97.8% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1) with a notable specific capacity of 224 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10&#160;mA g&#8722;1. This work provides an effective strategy for the rational design of cathode materials with high capacity and superior stability.

The degradable additive couple is developed to enable pure and preferential&#8208;oriented &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite with a bandgap of 1.489 eV and robustness against light, heat, and moisture over 1000 h, without the additive residue. The resultant perovskite solar cells achieve a power conversion efficiency of 25.20% with a short current density of 26.40 mA cm&#8722;2 and long&#8208;term operational stability of over 1000 h.








Abstract
Pure black&#8208;phase FAPbI3 has always been pursued because of its ideal bandgap (Eg) and high thermal stability. Here, a pair of sacrificial agents containing diethylamine hydrochloride (DEACl) and formamide (Fo) is reported, which can induce the oriented growth of black&#8208;phase FAPbI3 along (111) and will disappear by the aminolysis reaction during perovskite annealing, retaining the Eg of FAPbI3 as 1.49&#160;eV. In addition, the tensile strain of the target FAPbI3 is found to be mitigated with a stabilized black phase due to the tilt of FA+. The devices based on the pure and stable black&#8208;phase (111)&#8208;FAPbI3 achieved a power conversion efficiency of 25.2% and 24.2% (certified 23.51%) with an aperture area of 0.09 and 1.04 cm2, respectively. After 1080 h of operation at the maximum power point under 1&#8208;sun illumination (100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2), the devices maintained 91.68 &#177;&#160;0.72% of the initial efficiencies.

         <title>Ultralow Voltage Operation of p&#8208; and n&#8208;FETs Enabled by Self&#8208;Formed Gate Dielectric and Metal Contacts on 2D Tellurium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents atomically controlled material transformations in 2D Te for near&#8208;ideal FETs, featuring low&#8208;resistance NiTex&#8208;Te contacts and ultraclean TiOx&#8208;Te gate dielectrics (0.88 nm EOT). A record&#8208;low SS of 3.5 mV&#160;dec&#8722;1 is achieved at 10 K, and 2D Te&#8208;based CMOS inverters operate at 0.08 V, enabling energy&#8208;efficient IC technologies.








Abstract
The ongoing demand for more energy&#8208;efficient, high&#8208;performance electronics is driving the exploration of innovative materials and device architectures, where interfaces play a crucial role due to the continuous downscaling of device dimensions. Tellurium (Te), in its 2D form, offers significant potential due to its high carrier mobility and ambipolar characteristics, with the carrier type easily tunable via surface modulation. In this study, atomically controlled material transformations in 2D Te are leveraged to create intimate junctions, enabling near&#8208;ideal field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) for both n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type operation. A NiTex&#8208;Te contact provides highly transparent interfaces, resulting in low contact resistance, while the TiOx&#8208;Te gate dielectric forms an ultraclean interface with a capacitance equivalent to 0.88 nm equivalent oxide thickness (EOT), where the quantum capacitance of Te is observed. Subthreshold slopes (SS) approach the Boltzmann limit, with a record&#8208;low SS of 3.5 mV&#160;dec&#8722;1 achieved at 10 K. Furthermore, 2D Te&#8208;based complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) inverters are demonstrated operating at an ultralow voltage of 0.08&#160;V with a voltage gain of 7.1 V/V. This work presents a promising approach to forming intimate dielectric/semiconductor and metal/semiconductor junctions for next&#8208;generation low&#8208;power electronic devices.

         <title>Boosting Leaching of Spent Ternary Cathode via Strong Van Der Waals Force Beyond Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a novel design strategy is proposed by strengthening the van der Waals forces in the nanostructure of DESs, which significantly enhances the reducibility of DESs components. Benefiting from this, the leaching kinetics of metals is greatly improved, resulting in an excellent leaching performance that far exceeds previous reports.








Abstract
Promoting the green and efficient recycling of critical metals in spent ternary batteries represents a crucial step in driving the reduce of resource dependence in the electric vehicle industry. However, the leaching progress of metals from spent cathodes generally requires high reaction temperatures and large usage of solvents. Herein, a strategy is proposed to strengthen the van der Waals forces between solvent components by constructing affinity interactions between functional groups (e.g., &#8208;OH and &#8208;COOH), which can significantly enhance the leaching kinetics of metals at a high solid&#8208;liquid ratio and low temperature (30&#160;&#176;C). The results demonstrate that the strong van der Waals force between ascorbic acid with &#8208;OH group and betaine ions with &#8208;COOH group can strengthen the nucleophilicity of the carbon atoms and reduce the specific C&#9472;C bond energy, thus enhancing the redox capability of the DESs. Encouragingly, the designed solvent shows an impressive leaching performance at a super high S/L ratio (1: 3) without external heating for the actual black mass under a scaled&#8208;up experiment.

         <title>Modulating the Spatio&#8208;Temporal Sequence of Lithium Plating and Stripping via a 3D Host for Solid State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conducting 3D host is employed in solid&#8208;state batteries to modulate lithium plating and stripping behaviors, which can occur away from the interface to tackle dendrite and void formation issues. In situ electron microscopies and molecular dynamics simulations reveal the Li transport pathways in carbon&#8208;based Li metal anodes, which enable faster Li diffusion and high stripping capacity.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) are now under intensive research for their high energy density and excellent safety. However, the Li transport limitation in Li metal anode (LMA) leads to mass/stress accumulation, dendrite initiation and void formation at the interface, which seriously hinders the development of SSLMBs. Herein, it is demonstrated through in situ electron microscopies that a mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conducting (MIEC) 3D host can promote the Li transport in LMA by increasing the diffusion pathways along the carbonaceous framework, carbon/Li interface and Li metal surface, enabling a fast and long&#8208;distance (nearly 100&#160;&#181;m) diffusion of Li atoms in LMA. Consequently, the spatio&#8208;temporal sequence of Li plating/stripping can be fundamentally changed. Specifically, both deposition and dissolution can occur far away from the interface, thereby mitigating the dendrite and void issues. Impressively, the resulting cells with carbonaceous hosts can achieve excellent cyclability and the highest capacity (28.8&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2) so far. This work provides valuable insight for understanding Li transport and deposition/dissolution mechanisms in MIEC host&#8208;based LMAs, and a feasible solution for tackling the interface issues without involving stack pressure in SSLMBs.

         <title>Pre&#8208;Established Ion Transport Pathways Through Electrolyte Initiator for High&#8208;Efficiency Polymer Interface Enabling Ultra&#8208;Stable Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ multifunctional polymer interface layer with high&#8208;efficiency Zn2+ transport is prepared through the pre&#8208;established ion transport pathways of an innovative electrolyte initiator. This layer promotes rapid Zn2+ desolvation and uniform Zn2+ deposition, effectively suppressing interfacial side reactions and dendrite growths, thereby significantly extending the cycle life of aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries.









Abstract
Achieving stable zinc&#8208;metal anodes is pivotal to realizing high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries (AZMBs). The construction of a functional polymer interface layer on the zinc&#8208;metal anode surface is confirmed as an effective strategy for mitigating dendrite growth and side reactions, thereby significantly enhancing the stability of zinc&#8208;metal anode. However, polymers capable of withstanding electrolyte environments over the long term typically suffer from elevated interfacial impedance, which hinders Zn2+ transport. Here, a pioneering zinc&#8208;metal anode enabled by a functional polymer interface layer with high&#8208;efficiency ion transport is introduced. This polymer layer is polymerized in situ on the zinc&#8208;metal anode surface through an innovative redox initiation system, where zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate (Zn(OTf)2) salts function as both reductant and ion transport pre&#8208;pathways, ensuring high&#8208;efficiency ion transport.

&lt;p&gt;An in situ multifunctional polymer interface layer with high-efficiency Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transport is prepared through the pre-established ion transport pathways of an innovative electrolyte initiator. This layer promotes rapid Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; desolvation and uniform Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; deposition, effectively suppressing interfacial side reactions and dendrite growths, thereby significantly extending the cycle life of aqueous zinc-metal batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving stable zinc-metal anodes is pivotal to realizing high-performance aqueous zinc-metal batteries (AZMBs). The construction of a functional polymer interface layer on the zinc-metal anode surface is confirmed as an effective strategy for mitigating dendrite growth and side reactions, thereby significantly enhancing the stability of zinc-metal anode. However, polymers capable of withstanding electrolyte environments over the long term typically suffer from elevated interfacial impedance, which hinders Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transport. Here, a pioneering zinc-metal anode enabled by a functional polymer interface layer with high-efficiency ion transport is introduced. This polymer layer is polymerized in situ on the zinc-metal anode surface through an innovative redox initiation system, where zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate (Zn(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) salts function as both reductant and ion transport pre-pathways, ensuring high-efficiency ion transport. The resultant interface layer achieves an ideal balance of ionic conductivity, water resistance, adhesion, and mechanical properties, effectively suppressing dendrite growth and side reactions. Symmetric cells assembled with this interface layer deliver an impressive lifespan of 8800 and 1600&#160;h under 1 and 5&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. This interface layer further demonstrates exceptional feasibility and versatility in Zn-NVO and Zn-PANI batteries. This work provides groundbreaking insights into the strategic design of high-performance polymer interface layers for AZMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stimulus&#8208;Responsive Emission via Dynamic Triplet Energy Transfer in Organic Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Glass</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy is proposed based on host&#8208;guest doping to achieve stimulus&#8208;responsive, color&#8208;tunable, and time&#8208;dependent organic afterglow glasses by dynamic triplet energy transfer processes. Impressively, the phosphorescence resonance energy tranfer and Dexter&#8208;type triplet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet energy transfer mechanisms are revealed by fs&#8208;TA spectra. The potential applications of these organic glasses in advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting, dynamic data encryption, as well as large&#8208;area and flexible afterglow display are demonstrated.








Abstract
Dynamic organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) glasses with color tunability offer significant potential for practical applications due to their high transparency and excellent machinability. In this study, organic glasses with efficient and dynamic RTP properties are used as triplet donors, combined with commercially available chromophores as singlet/triplet acceptors, to successfully fabricate a series of host&#8208;guest doping glasses with color&#8208;tunable organic afterglow and dynamic responses to external stimuli. The energy transfer mechanisms, including triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet phosphorescence resonance energy transfer and Dexter&#8208;type triplet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet energy transfer, are confirmed using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art femtosecond time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy. These organic glasses demonstrate excellent transparency, good machinability, and dynamic responsiveness to external stimuli. The study highlights their potential applications in large&#8208;area afterglow glass fabrication, dynamic data encryption, and flexible afterglow displays. This work not only provides a simple design principle for developing novel organic glass materials with color tunability and dynamic responses but also promotes the potential applications of organic RTP materials in dynamic information encryption and flexible optoelectronics.

         <title>Dual Modification of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Exceptional High Piezo&#8208;Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel dual&#8208;modification approach, &#9472;NH&#8322; groups modification and Cu ions coordination, is first imposed on MIL&#8208;125, which greatly improved carrier separation due to the enhanced piezoelectricity of MOFs caused by polarity alteration, leading to exceptional high piezo&#8208;photocatalytic hydrogen production.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) face significant challenges in photocatalysis due to severe carrier recombination. Here, a novel approach is presented that incorporates &#9472;NH2 groups and Cu ions onto MOFs with a MIL&#8208;125 skeleton, forming NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 and Cu&#8208;NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125. This modification effectively enhances the polarity of MOFs, evidenced by significantly increased d33 values (from 1.69 to 26.21 pm/V) and notable higher dipole moments (from 6.60 to 25.99 D). Notably, it's the first demonstration of boosting MOFs piezoelectricity via a dual modulation strategy. Moreover, the polarity can be further amplified by ultrasonic vibration based on the positive piezoelectric effect, which is justified by in situ Raman spectra, COMSOL simulations, and DFT calculations, by taking into account the applied pressure. The positive impact of introduced piezoelectric effect in facilitating charge separation and transfer of Cu&#8208;NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125, proved by enhanced current response. Consequently, through coupling piezocatalysis and photocatalysis, the H2 production rate of Cu&#8208;NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 can be significantly enhanced to &#8776;2884.2 &#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1, 2.76 and 9.92 times higher than that of NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 and MIL&#8208;125, respectively, ranking first in all reported MOF&#8208;based piezo&#8208;photocatalysts. This research demonstrates the prospective opportunity for alleviating the severe carriers recombination problem for MOFs through the implantation of piezoelectric field driving force.

         <title>Europium(II) Complex with d&#8208;f Transition: New Emitter for Blue Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells with an External Quantum Efficiency of 19.8%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lanthanide Eu(II) complex is demonstrated as an emitter in&#160;light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) for the first time. The bis[hydrotris(3&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyrazolyl)borate]europium(II)&#160;complex based LEC achieved a record&#8208;breaking external quantum efficiency of 19.8% with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage coordinates of (0.12, 0.18).








Abstract
Light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) have good prospects in the solid&#8208;state lighting field due to their simple single&#8208;layer structure and low manufacturing cost. However, the lack of high&#8208;efficiency blue LECs limits their development and further application. To solve this problem, many luminescent materials with various mechanisms such as fluorescence, phosphorescence, and thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence are studied as emitters in LECs. Besides these materials, herein lanthanide europium(II) (Eu(II)) complex with d&#8208;f transition is demonstrated as a new type of emitter for LECs. In detail, a blue emitting Eu(II) complex bis[hydrotris(3&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyrazolyl)borate]europium(II) is dispersed into 9&#8208;(3&#8208;(triphenylsilyl)phenyl)&#8208;9H&#8208;3,9&#8242;&#8208;bicarbazole host and tetrahexylammonium tetrafluoroborate electrolyte to make a blend film, which attains a high photoluminescence quantum yield of &#8776;100%. The LEC using the blend film as an active layer achieves a blue emission with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage coordinates of (0.12, 0.18) and a record&#8208;breaking external quantum efficiency of 19.8%, corresponding to an exciton utilization efficiency of &#8776;100%. This work reveals that Eu(II) complex with d&#8208;f transition is a promising emitter toward high&#8208;performance blue LECs, which can inspire further research on Eu(II) complex based LECs.

         <title>Tracking Dynamics of Supported Indium Oxide Catalysts in CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol by In Situ TEM</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging with machine learning&#8208;based image analysis, this study directly visualizes and tracks dynamic restructuring in reducible oxide catalysts for green methanol synthesis. The findings reveal how supports modulate dynamic behaviors of reaction&#8208;induced InOx species, underpinning the superior methanol productivity of the In2O3/m&#8208;ZrO2 catalyst.








Abstract
Supported reducible oxides, such as indium oxide on monoclinic zirconia (In2O3/m&#8208;ZrO2), are promising catalysts for green methanol synthesis via CO2 hydrogenation. Growing evidence suggests that dynamic restructuring under reaction conditions plays a crucial but poorly understood role in catalytic performance. To address this, the direct visualization of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art In2O3/m&#8208;ZrO2 catalyst under CO2 hydrogenation conditions (T&#160; = &#160;553&#160;K, P&#160; = &#160;1.9&#160;bar, CO2:H2&#160; = &#160;1:4) is pioneered using in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), comparing its behavior to In2O3 on supports with similar (tetragonal, t&#8208;ZrO2 or anatase TiO2) or lower (LSm&#8208;ZrO2) surface areas. Complementary in situ infrared spectroscopy and catalytic tests confirm methanol formation under equivalent conditions. A machine&#8208;learning&#8208;based difference imaging approach differentiates and ranks restructuring patterns, revealing that partially reduced InOx species on m&#8208;ZrO2 undergo cyclic aggregation&#8208;redispersion via atomic surface migration, maintaining high active phase dispersion. High&#8208;resolution ex situ STEM analysis further shows the epitaxial formation of In2O3 mono&#8208; and bilayers on (100) m&#8208;ZrO2 facets, highlighting strong oxide&#8208;support interactions. In contrast, sintering prevails on t&#8208;ZrO2, a&#8208;TiO2, and low&#8208;surface m&#8208;ZrO2, correlating with lower methanol productivity. This work underscores the pivotal role of oxide&#8208;support interfacial interactions in the reaction&#8208;induced restructuring of InOx species and establishes a framework for tracking nanoscale catalyst dynamics.

     alt="Tracking Dynamics of Supported Indium Oxide Catalysts in CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol by In Situ TEM"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging with machine learning-based image analysis, this study directly visualizes and tracks dynamic restructuring in reducible oxide catalysts for green methanol synthesis. The findings reveal how supports modulate dynamic behaviors of reaction-induced InO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; species, underpinning the superior methanol productivity of the In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/m-ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supported reducible oxides, such as indium oxide on monoclinic zirconia (In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/m-ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), are promising catalysts for green methanol synthesis via CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation. Growing evidence suggests that dynamic restructuring under reaction conditions plays a crucial but poorly understood role in catalytic performance. To address this, the direct visualization of the state-of-the-art In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/m-ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst under CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation conditions (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&#160; = &#160;553&#160;K, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&#160; = &#160;1.9&#160;bar, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160; = &#160;1:4) is pioneered using in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), comparing its behavior to In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; on supports with similar (tetragonal, t-ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or anatase TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) or lower (LSm-ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) surface areas. Complementary in situ infrared spectroscopy and catalytic tests confirm methanol formation under equivalent conditions. A machine-learning-based difference imaging approach differentiates and ranks restructuring patterns, revealing that partially reduced InO&lt;i&gt;

         <title>Carbon Dot&#8208;Linked Hydrogel for TAMs Transform: Spatiotemporal Manipulation to Reshape Tumor Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CDs crosslinked egg white hydrogel loaded with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and CA170 (TTF&#8208;L&#8208;C) can realize spatiotemporal tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) transformation from multi&#8208;level dimensions, including spatial recruitment, cell phenotype reprogramming, and immune checkpoint molecule blockade. Finally, at the in vivo level, TTF&#8208;L&#8208;C can stimulate anti&#8208;tumor immunity through tumor microenvironment (TME) remodeling and reduce tumor recurrence with satisfactory biosafety.








Abstract
As one of the most crucial immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), regulating tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) is vital for enhancing antitumor immunity. Here, an injectable carbon dots (CDs)&#8208;linked egg white hydrogel was developed, termed TAMs Transform Factory (TTF&#8208;L&#8208;C), to spatiotemporally manipulate TAMs. The fabricated CDs significantly promoted macrophage migration. Notably, TTF&#8208;L&#8208;C achieved macrophage spatial enrichment through CDs&#8208;induced directional recruitment with molecular Ctnnd1 upregulation. Subsequently, the recruited macrophages were locoregionally reprogrammed within TTF&#8208;L&#8208;C, as well as blocking the upregulated PD&#8208;L1. Finally, through multi&#8208;stage regulation at spatial, cellular, and molecular levels, TTF&#8208;L&#8208;C released immune&#8208;activated M1 macrophages to the tumor site as it degraded. Moreover, TTF&#8208;L&#8208;C promoted dendritic cell (DCs) maturation and further boosted T cell activation, thereby reshaping the tumor&#8208;suppressive TME. Through peritumoral injection, TTF&#8208;L&#8208;C enhanced tumor immunotherapy in both subcutaneous and recurrent 4T1 tumor models with satisfactory biosafety. Therefore, TTF&#8208;L&#8208;C is proposed to become a safe and powerful platform for various biomedical applications.

         <title>Photochromic Control in Hybrid Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A functionalized photochromic material based on spiro&#8208;indoline naphthoxazine is applied to halide perovskite materials and the corresponding solar cells, demonstrating photoinduced transformation by a combination of techniques. This results in improvements in photovoltaic performances and operational stabilities, highlighting the potential of dynamic photochromic strategies in photovoltaics.








Abstract
The application of perovskite photovoltaics is hampered by issues related to the operational stability upon exposure&#160;to external stimuli, such as voltage bias and light. The dynamic control of the properties of perovskite materials in response to light could ensure the durability of perovskite solar cells, which is especially critical at the interface with charge&#8208;extraction layers. We&#160;have applied a functionalized photochromic material based on spiro&#8208;indoline naphthoxazine at the interface with hole&#8208;transport layers in the corresponding perovskite solar cells with the aim of stabilizing them in response to voltage bias and light. We demonstrate photoinduced transformation by a combination of techniques, including transient absorption spectroscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy. As a result, the application of the photochromic derivative offers improvements in photovoltaic performance and operational stability, highlighting&#160;the potential of dynamic photochromic strategies in perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution Manifold Acoustic Holography Based on High&#8208;Pixel&#8208;Array Binary Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes an approach for the efficient generation of manifold acoustic holograms underwater by using high&#8208;pixel&#8208;array binary metasurfaces. Beyond generating simple&#8208;pattern holograms, it is shown that increasing the pixel numbers within a single metasurface allows for the creation of 2D/3D complex holographic fields. Moreover, it is demonstrated that holograms at multiple depths or frequencies can be encoded within one metasurface, thereby enhancing its information capacity. This work holds significant potential for applications in fields such as biomedical imaging and non&#8208;contact particle manipulation. 








Abstract
Acoustic holograms using artificial materials have become an area of intense interest in acoustics due to the great potential in various applications such as medical imaging, underwater detection and object manipulation, etc. In this article, a general approach is proposed for designing high&#8208;pixel&#8208;array binary metasurfaces and then fabricating the intricate ultrathin structures via picosecond laser processing for implementing high&#8208;resolution manifold holograms in far fields. The angular spectrum propagation is utilized in combination with the forward optimization, instead of the Rayleigh&#8208;Sommerfeld integral, to efficiently simulate far&#8208;field holograms at the target plane. To obtain manifold acoustic holograms in the planes at different depths, zero&#8208;padding is utilized to break the tight constraint of sampling theorem. Benefiting from the realizable high&#8208;pixel&#8208;array binary metasurface, e.g., the number of pixels &#8776;90 000 or even more, high&#8208;resolution complicated holograms can be readily achieved. As an example, multi&#8208;depth holography, multi&#8208;frequency holography, and sophisticated holography are generated via binary metasurfaces. The functional meta&#8208;devices based on ultrasound amplitude modulations provide more opportunities for exploring practical applications of acoustic metamaterials.

         <title>Noninvasively Real&#8208;Time Monitoring In&#8208;Vivo Immune Cell and Tumor Cell Interaction by NIR&#8208;II Nanosensor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A noninvasive second near&#8208;infrared long&#8208;wavelength nanosensor (C8R&#8208;DSNP) for real&#8208;time monitoring of immune cell&#8208;tumor interactions in vivo is reported. The sensor detects caspase&#8208;8 activation during natural killer cells&#8208;induced apoptosis in tumor cells, providing dynamic, early&#8208;stage imaging within 4.5 h of treatment. This approach offers valuable insights for optimizing immunocytotherapy strategies with rapid, in vivo feedback.








Abstract
Immunocytotherapy holds significant promise as a novel cancer treatment, but its effectiveness is often hindered by delayed responses, requiring evaluations every 2&#8211;3 weeks based on current diagnostic methods. Early assessment of immune cell&#8208;tumor cell interactions could provide more timely insights into therapeutic efficacy, enabling adjustments to treatment plans. In this study, a noninvasive nanosensor (C8R&#8208;DSNP) for real&#8208;time monitoring of in vivo immune cell activities in the second near&#8208;infrared long&#8208;wavelength (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L) window (1500&#8211;1900&#160;nm), which offers deep tissue transparency, is reported. The C8R&#8208;DSNP responds rapidly to caspase&#8208;8, a key apoptotic signaling molecule generated during interactions between natural killer (NK&#8208;92) cells and tumor cells. Using ratiometric NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L fluorescence imaging, dynamic in vivo observations of NK&#8208;92 cells' engagement with tumor cells in a mouse model are captured. These results demonstrate tumor cells apoptosis that happens as early as 4.5 h after NK&#8208;92 cells infusion. Additionally, in vitro urine imaging confirmed the initiation of apoptosis via cleaved fluorescent small molecules, while single&#8208;cell tracking within blood vessels and tumors further elucidated immune cell dynamics. This real&#8208;time NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L monitoring approach offers valuable insights for optimizing immunocytotherapy strategies.

&lt;p&gt;A noninvasive second near-infrared long-wavelength nanosensor (C8R-DSNP) for real-time monitoring of immune cell-tumor interactions in vivo is reported. The sensor detects caspase-8 activation during natural killer cells-induced apoptosis in tumor cells, providing dynamic, early-stage imaging within 4.5 h of treatment.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Carbon Capture with Fluorine&#8208;Tailored Carbon Molecular Sieve Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance carbon capture using fluorine&#8208;tailored carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes is developed. By incorporating bent terphenyl monomers and both aliphatic/aromatic trifluoromethyl groups into the polymer precursor, the derived CMS membranes achieve exceptional CO&#8322; permeability of 47,190 Barrer and CO2/N2 selectivity of 28.3, maintaining 36,204 Barrer permeability and 35.3 selectivity under flue gas conditions.








Abstract
Increasing energy consumption and climate change present an urgent global challenge to achieve carbon neutrality, with CO2 capture as a top priority. Among various carbon capture technologies, CO2 membrane separation stands out for its simplicity and energy efficiency in applications including gas purification and industrial gas recovery. Herein, a series of fluorine&#8208;tailored porous carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes derived from precisely designed precursors, achieving a well&#8208;balanced high permeability and selectivity for CO2 separation are developed. Incorporating bent terphenyl monomers and both aliphatic/aromatic trifluoromethyl groups disrupted dense chain packing and promoted pore formation with enhanced permeability and selectivity for CO2 separation. The TFM&#8208;550 membrane, derived from a fluorinated stretched polymer backbone precursor, exhibits exceptional performance with a CO2 permeability of 47&#160;190&#160;&#177;&#160;3204 Barrer and a CO2/N2 selectivity of 28.3&#160;&#177;&#160;5.7, while TFM&#8208;800 presented a higher selectivity of 71.8&#160;&#177;&#160;11.5, surpassing the 2019 upper bound. Furthermore, under flue gas conditions (CO2/O2/N2 = 1/1/4 in molar ratio), the CMS membrane demonstrate high CO2 permeability of 36,204&#160;&#177;&#160;2,235 Barrer and outstanding CO2/N2 selectivity of 35.3&#160;&#177;&#160;1.8. The results here highlight the effectiveness of fluorine tailoring and the potential of fluorinated CMS membranes for sustainable industrial carbon capture applications.

         <title>A Colorful Electrochromic Infrared Emissivity Regulator for All&#8208;Season Intelligent Thermal Management in Buildings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spectrally selective colorful electrochromic infrared emissivity regulator (CECIER) is presented for all&#8208;season building thermal management. It enables multi&#8208;modal dynamic infrared emissivity regulation in the atmospheric window while reducing parasitic heat through high reflectance in the non&#8208;atmospheric window. The regulator achieves &#8776;2&#176;C (night) and 3&#176;C (day) temperature adjustments and 3.46 MJ&#160;m&#8722;2 annual building energy savings.








Abstract
Radiative cooling is a technology that utilizes the high emissivity of materials in the atmospheric window to achieve cooling, showing great application prospects in building energy&#8208;saving. However, traditional static passive radiative cooling materials with broad&#8208;spectrum high emissivity can lead to increased heating energy consumption in winter due to overcooling and a weakened cooling effect in summer due to the urban heat island effect. In this study, a colorful, intelligent infrared emissivity regulator is well designed based on a multi film ultrathin electrochromic device for all&#8208;season thermal management in buildings. The infrared emissivity of the regulator can vary in real time in response to seasonal or temperature variations, allowing for the switching between radiative cooling and insulation. Guided by nano&#8208;photonics theory for multilayer optical films, the regulator achieves multi&#8208;modal dynamic infrared emissivity regulation in the atmospheric window &#916;&#949;&#175;$\Delta \ \bar{\varepsilon }$&#916;&#949;&#175;$\Delta \ \bar{\varepsilon }$, and the high reflectance in the non&#8208;atmospheric window inhibits heat gains from the external environment. The regulator demonstrates excellent environmental adaptivity with an acceptable response time, a long cycle life, and good bending resistance. The regulator can achieve &#8776;2 &#176;C/3 &#176;C (nighttime/daytime) temperature adjustment. The simulation results indicate that the regulator can achieve an annual building energy saving of 3.46&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;2.

         <title>Current Control of Spin Helicity and Nonreciprocal Charge Transport in a Multiferroic Conductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conducting multiferroic state of spin origin with both electronic polarity (P) and magnetization (M) can be controlled and detected by electric current in a high&#8208;temperature helimagnet YMn6Sn6. The underlying concept is the coupling of the electric current with the toroidal moment T&#8764;P&#215;M$\bm{T}\sim \bm{P}\ensuremath{\times{}}\bm{M}$. The controllability of state variables like P and T in conductors enhances the potential of spin&#8208;helicity&#8208;based spintronics.









Abstract
A multiferroic state with both electronic polarity (P) and magnetization (M) shows the inherently strong P&#8208;M coupling when P is induced by cycloidal (N&#233;el&#8208;wall like) spin modulation. The sign of P is determined by the clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of spin, termed the spin helicity. Such a multiferroic state is not limited to magnetic insulators but can be broadly observed in conductors. Here, the current control of the multiferroics is reported in a helimagnetic metal YMn6Sn6 and its detection through nonreciprocal resistivity (NRR). The underlying concept is the coupling of the current with the toroidal moment T&#8764;P&#215;M&#8764;(q&#770;&#215;&#967;v)&#215;M$\bm{T}\sim \bm{P}\ensuremath{\times{}}\bm{M}\sim (\widehat{\bm{q}}\ensuremath{\times{}}{\bm{\chi}}_{v})\ensuremath{\times{}}\bm{M}$ as well as with the magneto&#8208;chirality &#967;v &#183; M, whereq&#770;$\hspace*{0.28em}\widehat{\bm{q}}$ and &#967;v are the unit modulation wave vector and the vector spin chirality, respectively. An enhancement of NRR is furthermore observed by the spin&#8208;cluster scattering via &#967;v and its fluctuation. These findings may pave the way to an exploration of multiferroic conductors and the application of the spin&#8208;helicity degree of freedom as a state variable.

         <title>A Durable Metalgel Maintaining 3&#215;106 S&#8729;M&#8210;1 Conductivity under 1&#160;000&#160;000 Stretching Cycles</title>

This work presents a new metalgel that immobilizes liquid metal continuum within waterborne polyurethane networks through electrostatic interactions. The polymer network, enriched with dynamic reversible structures, provides a durable structure for repeated stretching. Simultaneously, the electrostatic interactions enable synchronous deformations of both polymer networks and liquid metal. Benefiting from this design, this durable metalgel exhibits a high and stable conductivity of 3 &#215; 106 S&#8729;m&#8722;1 even after 1&#160;000&#160;000 stretching cycles. This work overcomes the performance limitations of current conductive elastomers and unlocks new opportunities for cutting&#8208;edge applications.








Abstract
Conductive elastomers are in high demand for emerging fields such as wearable electronics and soft robotics. However, it remains unavailable to realize the desired metal&#8208;level conductivity after extensive stretching cycles, which is a necessity for the above promising application. Here, a new material is presented that employs an elastic, homogeneous, and dense waterborne polyurethane network to immobilize the liquid metal continuum via electrostatic interactions. This new design enables the liquid metal continuum to deform synchronously and reversibly with the polymer network, preserving its conductive structure and significantly enhancing durability. The resulting durable metalgel exhibits conductivity of 3 &#215; 106 S&#8729;m&#8722;1, which remains stable after 1&#160;000&#160;000 stretching cycles. This work overcomes the performance limitations of current conductive elastomers and unlocks new opportunities for cutting&#8208;edge applications in wearable technology and robotics.

         <title>Creating Sodium Ion Channels via De Novo Encapsulation of Ionophores for Enhanced Water Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a synthetic membrane with sodium ionophores integrated into a covalent organic framework, mimicking the permselectivity and cation discrimination of biological ion channels. The membrane exhibits high Na+ selectivity, achieving Na+/K+ and Na+/Li+ selectivities of 3.6 and 103, respectively, and improves power density by a 4.6&#8208;fold in the presence of high&#8208;valent cation salts, enhancing energy conversion efficiency.








Abstract
Biological ion channels achieve remarkable permselectivity and cation discrimination through the synergy of their intricate architectures and specialized ionophores within confined nanospaces, enabling efficient energy conversion. Emulating such selectivity in synthetic nanochannels, however, remains a persistent challenge. To address this, a novel host&#8208;guest assembly membrane is developed by incorporating sodium&#8208;selective ionophores into a &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF). This design confers exceptional permselectivity and Na+ selectivity, achieving Na+/K+ and Na+/Li+ selectivity ratios of 3.6 and 103, respectively, along with near&#8208;perfect Na+/Cl&#8722; selectivity under a 0.5&#160;M || 0.01&#160;M salinity gradient. Notably, the membrane dynamically switches its permselectivity to favor anion transport in the presence of high&#8208;valent cations (e.g., Ca2+), overcoming limitations such as uphill cation diffusion and back currents observed in conventional cation&#8208;selective membranes. This adaptive behavior yields a 4.6&#8208;fold increase in output power density in Ca2+&#8208;rich environments. These findings advance the design of biomimetic nanochannels with unparalleled ion selectivity and enhanced energy conversion efficiency.

         <title>Memristive InAs&#8208;Based Semiconductors with Anisotropic Ion Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Memristive semiconductor HxNa2&#8208;xIn2As3 exhibits memristive switching and maintains semiconductor properties through ion migration in its vdW gaps. Low ion migration energy enables a low set voltage, while its low&#8208;symmetry structure produces anisotropic ion transport, offering insights into directional dependence. These findings can guide the development of energy&#8208;efficient memtransistors.








Abstract
The use of the van der Waals (vdW) gap as an ion migration path, similar to cathode materials in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, enables improved ion migration. If these materials also possess semiconductor properties, they can simultaneously control electron or hole transport. Such materials can be used in memtransistors, which combine memory and semiconductor characteristics. However, the existing materials rely on defects such as grain boundaries as migration paths, resulting in high ion migration energy barriers and switching voltages. Herein, memtransistors are demonstrated using HxNa2&#8208;xIn2As3, which utilizes the vdW gap for ion migration, resulting in lower ion migration energy barriers. It is confirmed that ion migration occurs more readily in the [010] direction in a low&#8208;symmetry crystal structure owing to a lower migration energy barrier, whereas migration does not occur in the [100] direction, demonstrating directional dependence. This finding provides crucial guidelines for identifying ion migration in semiconductor materials, which can otherwise be overlooked. The use of the vdW gap as the migration path, variation in migration energy barriers with the ion movement direction, and their impact on low power consumption are critical factors that will guide the future development of memtransistor materials.

         <title>Wettability Sequence Optimization and Interface Strain Buffering in Triple Mesoporous Layer&#8208;Based Printable Perovskite Solar Cells for Enhanced Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interface in printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells is regulated via the flexible molecule of dodecaethylene glycol (DEG) with abundant polar oxygen atoms. The regulation modulated the wetting sequence of the scaffold, promoted perovskite crystallization in the scaffold, and relaxed interface stress. The device with interface regulation successfully achieved an improved power conversion efficiency of 20.27% and demonstrated good stability.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells have achieved remarkable progress in photovoltaic performance, driven by advancements in interface engineering. The buried interface between the electron transport layer and the perovskite layer is particularly critical, as it governs both perovskite crystallization and the formation of residual strain. In this study, the buried interface in printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells (p&#8208;MPSCs) based on a triple&#8208;mesoporous scaffold of TiO2/ZrO2/carbon is reconstructed by employing dodecaethylene glycol (DEG), a long chain molecule rich in polar oxygen atoms, to enhance device performance. Treating the scaffold with DEG optimizes the wettability sequence across the three layers by improving the TiO2 surface's wettability, facilitating the preferential crystallization of perovskite in the underlying TiO2 layer. Moreover, the DEG layer effectively buffers residual strain and suppresses detrimental defects at the interface. As a result, p&#8208;MPSCs with the optimized interface achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.27% and retain over 92% of their initial PCE after 500 h of continuous operation under maximum power point tracking.

To address off&#8208;target organ enrichment and low endosomal escape during mRNA delivery, the study learns from the technology of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and integrate cholesterol moieties and zwitterionic species into branched poly(&#946;&#8208;amino ester)s (hPAEs) to obtain &#8220;four&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; LNP&#8208;like hPAEs (O&#8208;LhPAEs), which have spleen&#8208;targeted delivery and have potential for the treatment of silicosis by nebulization.








Abstract
mRNA therapeutics hold tremendous promise for disease prevention and treatment. Development of high&#8208;performance mRNA delivery systems with enhanced transfection efficiency and a safety profile will further fulfill their therapeutic potential and expedite their translation. The synthesis of &#8220;four&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; highly branched poly(&#946;&#8208;amino ester)s (O&#8208;LhPAEs) is reported by integrating the essential components of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for spleen&#8208;selective mRNA enrichment and nebulization treatment of silicosis. 60 O&#8208;LhPAEs with distinct branched structure and chemical composition, including tertiary/quaternary amines, cholesterol moieties, zwitterionic species, and hydrophobic alkyl tails, are synthesized using sequential Michael addition, ring&#8208;opening, and nucleophilic substitution reactions. The unique topological structure and chemical composition collectively enhanced O&#8208;LhPAEs/mRNA polyplex serum resistance, cellular uptake, and endosomal escape. The optimal O&#8208;LhPAE, 20%b&#8208;3C&#8208;2P12, exhibits up to 93.1% mRNA transfection across 11 different cell types, including epithelial cells, fibroblasts, cancer cells, stem cells, neurological cells, and astrocytes. Biodistribution study reveals that 20%b&#8208;3C&#8208;2P12/mRNA polyplexes are mainly enriched in the spleen following systemic administration. Through nebulization, 20%b&#8208;3C&#8208;2P12 mediated high Tbx2 mRNA expression in the lungs of silicosis mice, effectively restoring lung functions. This study not only establishes a strategy for development of LNP&#8208;like O&#8208;LhPAEs but also provides promising candidates for highly safe, efficient, and spleen&#8208;selective mRNA delivery and nebulization treatment of silicosis.

         <title>Chiroferromagnetic Quantum Dots for Chiroptical Synapse (ChiropS)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiroptical activity is enhanced by up to 0.003 in the g&#8208;factor through the induction of ferromagnetism in quantum dots. A chiroptical neuromorphic synapse, composed of chiroferromagnetic quantum dots, generates different synaptic weights from multiple wavelengths and circularly polarized light. The low&#8208;level preprocessing unit of the multi&#8208;channel neuromorphic device functions as a low&#8208;level optical noise filter, enabling energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Optoelectronic devices using circularly polarized light (CPL) offer enhanced sensitivity and specificity for efficient data processing. There is a growing demand for CPL sensing mediums with strong optical activity, stability and sensitivity, multiple transition bands, and environmental compatibility. Here, defect&#8208;engineered chiroferromagnetic quantum dots (CFQDs) are used as a new type of CPL sensing material. By inducing amorphization defects through chiral molecules, CFQDs with high unpaired electron density, atomic structural chirality, amplified chiroptical activity, and multiple exciton transition bands are developed. CFQDs enable nonlinear, long&#8208;term plastic behavior with linear optical input, acting as in situ noise filters that reduce noise by over 20%. Additionally, CFQDs provide over nine times higher integration for photon polarization and wavelength distinctions, paving the way for next&#8208;generation processors with improved energy efficiency, integration, and reduced retention time.

         <title>Facet Engineering of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Triboelectric Nanogenerators&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Powered Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and scalable dual&#8208;solvent strategy is developed to fabricate dendritic ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;D with tailored preferred facet and coordination environments. The reduced Co coordination number and enhanced electron&#8208;donating capability lead to significantly improved performance in triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) and electrocatalysis, highlighting the multifunctional potential of ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;D.









Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are highly versatile materials with tunable chemical and structural properties, making them promising for triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) and electrocatalysis. However, achieving precise control over MOF coordination structures to optimize facet&#8208;dependent properties remains challenging. Here, a facile and scalable dual&#8208;solvent synthesis strategy is presented to fabricate dendrite Co&#8208;2&#8208;methylimidazole MOF (ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;D), enabling tailored preferred facet and coordination environments. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, it is demonstrated that ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;D, enriched with (112) facets, features a reduced Co coordination number and enhanced electron&#8208;donating ability compared to the conventionally (011) facet&#8208;dominated rhombic dodecahedron ZIF&#8208;67 (ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;R). This facet engineering boosts TENG charge density by 2.4&#8208;fold, OER current density by 9.9&#8208;fold (@1.65&#160;V), and HER current density by 1.9&#8208;fold (@&#8208;0.3&#160;V). The (112)/(011) facet ratio can be also tuned to precisely alter TENG output. Moreover, the optimized ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;D shows excellent stability, maintaining electrolyzer performance for 72&#160;h and enabling TENG devices even in high humidity. Consequently, ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;D&#8208;based TENG (D&#8208;TENG) devices exhibit robust energy generation and power ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;D||ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;D electrolyzers for continuous hydrogen (H2) production. These findings introduce a new paradigm for converting mechanical energy into sustainable chemical energy, offering insights into facet engineering for high&#8208;performance energy harvesting systems.

         <title>Efficient White Electroluminescence from Cu&#8208;based Perovskite Achieved by High Hole Injection Core/Shell Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates a p&#8208;type cuprous sulfide lattice connectedly capping over Cs3Cu2I5 to form lattice&#8208;matched core/shell nanocrystals by controlling the reactivity of sulfur precursor in the synthesis. The resulting pure white PeLEDs achieved by combining with yellow emission CsCu2I3 exhibit a recorded EQE of 3.45% and a high CRI of 91.








Abstract
The copper&#8208;based (Cu&#8208;based) halide perovskite possesses eco&#8208;friendly features, bright self&#8208;trapped&#8208;exciton (broadband) emission, and a high color&#8208;rendering index (CRI) for achieving white emission. However, the limited hole injection (HI) of Cu&#8208;based perovskites has been bottle&#8208;necking the efficiency of white electroluminescence and thus their application in white perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (W&#8208;PeLEDs). In this study, we demonstrate a p&#8208;type cuprous sulfide (Cu2S) lattice&#8208;connectedly capping over Cs3Cu2I5 to form lattice&#8208;matched core/shell nanocrystals (NCs) by controlling the reactivity of sulfur (S) precursor in the synthesis. Interestingly, the resultant Cs3Cu2I5/Cu2S NCs significantly enhance the hole mobility compared to Cs3Cu2I5 NCs. Besides, the photoluminescence quantum yield of Cs3Cu2I5 NCs increases from 26.8% to 70.6% after the Cu2S lattice&#8208;connected capping. Consequently, by establishing the structure of CsCu2I3/Cs3Cu2I5/Cu2S in W&#8208;PeLEDs, an external quantum efficiency of 3.45% and a CRI of 91 is realized, representing the highest reported electroluminescent performance in lead&#8208;free Cu&#8208;based W&#8208;PeLEDs. These findings contribute to establishing guidelines and effective strategies for designing broadband electroluminescent materials and device structures of PeLEDs.

         <title>Utilizing Electron&#8208;Sink&#8208;Enhanced Nanoshells for Amplified Nanoplasmonic SERS&#8208;Based In Situ Detection of Cancer Cells, Linking Signal Enhancement with Cellular Damage</title>

A novel method for detecting cancer cells and monitoring apoptosis employs electron&#8208;sink&#8208;enhanced surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). Gold (Au) shells coated with electroactive liposome membranes amplify the SERS signal through active electron transfer. This technique enables real&#8208;time and highly sensitive detection of cancer cells by measuring apoptosis&#8208;associated electron flow, offering a powerful approach for distinguishing cancerous from normal cells.








Abstract
A novel method is presented for detecting cancer cells and assessing apoptosis using electron&#8208;sink&#8208;enhanced surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) via active electron transfer. By coating gold (Au) shells with electroactive liposome membranes (ELMs) derived from Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1, the SERS signal is enhanced through chemical mechanism (CM) enhancement driven by electron transfer. The ELMs first donate electrons to the Au shells, which, upon laser excitation, amplify the local electromagnetic field, resulting in stronger Raman signals from the attached probing molecules. Additionally, the electron flow from cancer cells into the Au shells correlates with apoptosis, producing a strong SERS signal, while normal cells exhibit weaker signals. This method enables real&#8208;time monitoring of cancer cell apoptosis, distinguishing cancer cells from normal cells based on the enhanced Raman signal linked to electron flow. This approach marks a breakthrough in CM&#8208;based SERS applications, offering a sensitive method for cancer detection through the measurement of electron flow.

         <title>In Situ Construction of a 3D Superionic Skeleton in Sodium Anode for Solid&#8208;State Sodium Batteries with a 15&#160;000&#8208;Cycle Lifespan at 3C</title>

In this work, a 3D superionic transport skeleton Na3P is in situ constructed within the sodium anode, which successfully enhances the ion diffusion coefficient of the anode from 2.54 &#215; 10&#8210;8 to 1.33 &#215; 10&#8210;7 cm2 s&#8210;1. Thanks to the ultrafast ion transport and excellent interfacial stability, the solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;metal battery can be stably cycled for more than 15&#160;000&#8208;cycle at 3C.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SSSMBs) have emerged as a promising candidate for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems due to their natural abundance, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and high safety. However, the intrinsically low ionic conductivity of sodium anode (SA) and poor wettability to solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) severely hinder the development of SSSMBs. In this study, a 3D superionic transport skeleton Na3P is in situ constructed within the sodium anode by simply melting inexpensive and low&#8208;density red phosphorus with sodium, which successfully enhances the ion diffusion rate from 2.54 &#215; 10&#8210;8 to 1.33 &#215; 10&#8210;7 cm2 s&#8210;1. Moreover, Na3P in the composite sodium anode (CSA) effectively induces the uniform deposition of Na on the surface of SSE, significantly reducing the interface impedance of symmetric cells from the initial value of 749.15 to 14.97 &#937; cm2. Enabled by the integrated 3D superionic transport skeleton, the symmetric cell achieves exceptional cycle stability of over 7000&#160;h at 0.1&#160;mA cm&#8210;2 and 4000&#160;h at 0.3&#160;mA cm&#8210;2. Furthermore, SSSMBs incorporating CSA demonstrate an ultralong lifespan of over 15&#160;000 cycles at 3C while maintaining a high&#8208;loading operation capability, significantly outperforming previously reported studies. This study highlights the crucial role of cost&#8208;effective CSA design with enhanced ion transport in advancing high&#8208;performance SSSMBs.

         <title>Synchronous Sterilization and Immunoreaction Termination for Corneal Transparency Protection in Treating Pseudomonas aeruginosa Induced Bacterial Keratitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The large&#8208;pore MSNs with a high specific surface area serve as a platform for covalent PMB grafting and bactericidal CQD loading. CQD@lMSN&#8208;PMB exhibits efficient antibacterial activity alongside synchronous endotoxin neutralization. In Gram&#8208;negative bacterial keratitis, CQD@lMSN&#8208;PMB effectively and comprehensively suppresses the immune&#8208;inflammatory response, preserving corneal integrity and transparency.








Abstract
In the treatment of infectious keratitis, therapeutic strategies often prioritize enhancing bactericidal efficacy. However, endotoxins released from Gram&#8208;negative bacteria cause inflammatory reaction, leading to corneal structural damage and scar formation. Given that polymyxin B (PMB) can bind and neutralize lipopolysaccharide (LPS), this study employs large&#8208;pore mesoporous silica nanoparticles (lMSNs) grafted with PMB as carriers for cationic antibacterial carbon quantum dots (CQDs) to prepare CQD@lMSN&#8208;PMB, which enables synchronous sterilization and endotoxin neutralization. In the acidic infectious microenvironment, the accelerated release of CQDs eliminates 99.88% bacteria within 2&#160;h, effectively substituting immune mediated sterilization. Notably, CQD@lMSN&#8208;PMB exhibits exceptional LPS neutralization performance (2.22&#160;&#181;g LPS/mg CQD@lMSN&#8208;PMB) due to its high specific surface area. In an infectious keratitis model, inflammation subsides significantly within the first day of CQD@lMSN&#8208;PMB intervention and is completely resolved by day 3. By day 2, interleukin&#8208;1&#946;, interleukin&#8208;6 and tumor necrosis factor&#8208;&#945; in CQD@lMSN&#8208;PMB group decrease by 86.99%, 91.15%, and 77.56%, respectively, compared to the CQDs&#8208;only sterilization group. Ultimately, corneal integrity and transparency are preserved, with suppressed expressions of fibrosis&#8208;related factors including matrix metalloproteinase 9, transforming growth factor&#8208;&#946; and &#945;&#8208;smooth muscle actin. Therefore, this synchronous sterilization and endotoxin neutralization strategy outperforms monotherapy strategies focused solely on sterilization or endotoxin neutralization.

         <title>Mechanically&#8208;Tunable and Full&#8208;Color Circularly Polarized Long&#8208;Lived Phosphorescence in Chiral Superstructure Elastomers</title>

         <dc:description>
An effective strategy is presented to fabricate the chiral superstructure elastomers (CSEs) that display selective reflection colors, dynamically tunable CP&#8208;OURTP with robust glum values, full&#8208;color afterglow emissions, and superior processability within a single system.








Abstract
Developing full&#8208;color circularly polarized organic ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (CP&#8208;OURTP) materials with high dissymmetry factor (glum) holds significant promise for diverse optoelectronic applications. Controlling glum values is crucial for enhancing the performance and functionality of these materials, as it directly influences their chiroptical properties and potential utilities in advanced technologies. However, achieving reversible and dynamic manipulation of glum in CP&#8208;OURTP materials remains a formidable challenge. Herein, an effective strategy is presented to fabricate the chiral superstructure elastomers (CSEs) that display selective reflection colors, dynamically tunable CP&#8208;OURTP with robust glum values, full&#8208;color afterglow emissions, and superior processability within a single system. By integrating room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) polymers into the CSEs, CSEs are produced demonstrating tunable CP&#8208;OURTP with glum values switching between 0.8 and 0.15 by mechanical deformation. More importantly, these mechanochromic, programmable, and full&#8208;color CP&#8208;OURTP films enable the development of flexible and dynamic information encryption and decryption. The work provides new insights into the development of novel RTP materials and advances in their potential applications.

         <title>AI&#8208;Guided Design of Antimicrobial Peptide Hydrogels for Precise Treatment of Drug&#8208;resistant Bacterial Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>

An AI&#8208;guided design platform (AMP&#8208;hydrogel&#8208;Designer) is developed to design antibacterial biomaterials by integrating thiol&#8208;modified AMPs, hydrogels, and Cu&#8208;BTO. The AI&#8208;designed hydrogel exhibits potent bactericidal efficacy against MRSA and E. coli, promotes angiogenesis via mechano&#8208;electrical signals, and accelerates healing in infected wounds.








Abstract
Traditional biomaterial development lacks systematicity and predictability, posing significant challenges in addressing the intricate engineering issues related to infections with drug&#8208;resistant bacteria. The unprecedented ability of artificial intelligence (AI) to manage complex systems offers a novel paradigm for materials development. However, no AI model currently guides the development of antibacterial biomaterials based on an in&#8208;depth understanding of the interplay between biomaterials and bacteria. In this study, an AI&#8208;guided design platform (AMP&#8208;hydrogel&#8208;Designer) is developed to generate antibacterial biomaterials. This platform utilizes generative design and multi&#8208;objective constrained optimization to generate a novel thiol&#8208;containing high&#8208;efficiency antimicrobial peptide (AMP), that is functionally coupled with hydrogel to form a complex network structure. Additionally, Cu&#8208;modified barium titanate (Cu&#8208;BTO) is incorporated to facilitate further complex cross&#8211;linking via Cu2+/SH coordination to produce an AI&#8208;AMP&#8208;hydrogel. In vitro, the AI&#8208;AMP&#8208;hydrogel exhibits &gt; 99.99% bactericidal efficacy against Methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Escherichia coli (E. coli). Furthermore, Cu&#8208;BTO converts mechanical stimulation into electrical signals, thereby promoting the expression of growth factors and angiogenesis. In a rat model with dynamic wounds, the AI&#8208;AMP hydrogel significantly reduces the MRSA load and markedly accelerates wound healing. Therefore, the AI&#8208;guided biomaterial development strategy offers an innovative solution to precisely treat drug&#8208;resistant bacterial infections.

         <title>Regulating Carrier Transport Behavior for Capacitive Energy Storage of Polymer Dielectrics in Harsh Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carrier transport behavior is regulated rather than the previously oversimplified limitation strategy to reduce losses and enhance energy storage efficiency. It is expected to offer a novel and effective theoretical basis for the design and fabrication of advanced polymer dielectrics with high capacitive energy storage level at harsh environments.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics with high capacitive energy&#8208;storage levels in harsh environments have become key components in electrostatic capacitors. However, excessive losses in polymer dielectrics caused by high carrier densities at high temperatures and strong electric fields often result in low energy storage efficiency, which is the most challenging problem that urgently needs to be solved. In existing studies, the losses are mainly suppressed by limiting carrier formation; however, it is very challenging to completely limit carrier formation, especially at high temperatures and strong electric fields. Therefore, this perspective proposes to regulate the carrier transport behavior through &#8220;guiding/constraining/blocking&#8221; forms rather than the previously oversimplified carrier limitation strategy, which further clarifies dominant structure factors that inhibit carrier transport to reduce losses and enhance energy storage efficiency. Meanwhile, the influence of different structural designs on carrier transport behavior, individually or collaboratively, must be systematically studied to determine the specific mode of carrier transport behavior, thereby establishing a relationship between carrier transport behavior and energy storage efficiency. The presented perspective is expected to offer a novel and effective theoretical basis for the design and fabrication of advanced polymer dielectrics with high capacitive energy storage levels in harsh environments.

Geometric Design Strategy for Solid Electrolyte Interphase
In article number 2418773, Jong&#8208;Won Lee, Seungbum Hong, Nam&#8208;Soon Choi, and colleagues demonstrate that a solid electrolyte interphase enriched with small grains enhances Li+ ion transport by providing abundant pathways. Moreover, a soft&#8208;solvating environment improves the desolvation kinetics of solvated Li+ ions under fast&#8208;charging conditions. Additionally, replacing ethylene carbonate with isobutyronitrile enables a high discharge capacity during rapid charging while mitigating Li plating.

Interlocking Antiphase Boundary
In article number 2416616, Xi Shen, Jun Miao, Richeng Yu, and co&#8208;workers report a coupling phenomenon between the antiphase boundary (APB) and the 180&#176; ferroelectric domain wall in PbTiO3, which is referred to as the antiphase ferroelectric boundary (APFB). It also illustrates the potential applications of APFBs in PbTiO3 films due to the sharp, straight morphology and the coupling feature. AFPBs retain a high degree of similarity to conventional domain walls, which may serve as dividers of domains and could be used in promising strategy for miniaturizing ferroelectric devices.

Implantable devices typically rely on batteries that require surgical replacement, leading to potential health risks and financial burdens. Ultrasound energy transfer presents a promising wireless alternative, though its efficiency remains a challenge. The proposed dielectric&#8208;ferroelectric&#8208;boosted ultrasound triboelectric nanogenerator is a thin, flexible, and biocompatible solution that enables efficient and stable power delivery, even in curved configurations. This innovation paves the way for noninvasive, sustainable wireless energy transfer in biomedical applications. More details can be found in article number 2419264 by Sunghoon Hur, Hyun&#8208;Cheol Song, and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Responsive Molecules for Organic Neuromorphic Devices: Harnessing Memory Diversification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Responsive molecules are essential for organic in&#8208;sensor computing devices. This Review highlights recent advances in thedesign, synthesis, and incorporation of electrically, optically, and magnetically responsive molecules in multifunctional synaptic perception devices endowedwith both nonvolatile and volatile memory diversification. By exploiting the multifunctional nature of molecular switches, complex logic operations can be accomplished, bringing molecule&#8208;based neuromorphic computing closer to become a real technology.








Abstract
In the brain, both the recording and decaying of memory information following external stimulus spikes are fundamental learning rules that determine human behaviors. The former is essential to acquire new knowledge and update the database, while the latter filters noise and autorefresh cache data to reduce energy consumption. To execute these functions, the brain relies on different neuromorphic transmitters possessing various memory kinetics, which can be classified as nonvolatile and volatile memory. Inspired by the human brain, nonvolatile and volatile memory electronic devices have been employed to realize artificial neural networks and spiking neural networks, respectively, which have emerged as essential tools in machine learning. Molecular switches, capable of responding to electrical, optical, electrochemical, and magnetic stimuli, display a disruptive potential for emulating information storage in memory devices. This Review highlights recent developments on responsive molecules, their interfacing with low&#8208;dimensional nanostructures and nanomaterials, and their integration into electronic devices. By capitalizing on these concepts, a unique account of neurotransmitter&#8208;transfer electronic devices based on responsive molecules with ad hoc memory kinetics is provided. Finally, future directions, challenges, and opportunities are discussed on the use of these devices to engineer more complex logic operations and computing functions at the hardware level.

         <title>Strategic Development of Memristors for Neuromorphic Systems: Low&#8208;Power and Reconfigurable Operation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review investigates technological trends in brain&#8208;inspired artificial reconfigurable memristors, as well as individual non&#8208;volatile and volatile devices, according to their operating principles and fabrication methods. It examines case studies of artificial neural network system implementations based on these devices, providing the latest comprehensive design guidelines from fundamentals to advanced systems.








Abstract
The ongoing global energy crisis has heightened the demand for low&#8208;power electronic devices, driving interest in neuromorphic computing inspired by the parallel processing of human brains and energy efficiency. Reconfigurable memristors, which integrate both volatile and non&#8208;volatile behaviors within a single unit, offer a powerful solution for in&#8208;memory computing, addressing the von Neumann bottleneck that limits conventional computing architectures. These versatile devices combine the high density, low power consumption, and adaptability of memristors, positioning them as superior alternatives to traditional complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) technology for emulating brain&#8208;like functions. Despite their potential, studies on reconfigurable memristors remain sparse and are often limited to specific materials such as Mott insulators without fully addressing their unique reconfigurability. This review specifically focuses on reconfigurable memristors, examining their dual&#8208;mode operation, diverse physical mechanisms, structural designs, material properties, switching behaviors, and neuromorphic applications. It highlights the recent advancements in low&#8208;power&#8208;consumption solutions within memristor&#8208;based neural networks and critically evaluates the challenges in deploying reconfigurable memristors as standalone devices or within artificial neural systems. The review provides in&#8208;depth technical insights and quantitative benchmarks to guide the future development and implementation of reconfigurable memristors in low&#8208;power neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Anisotropic Microcarriers: Fabrication Strategies and Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anisotropic microcarriers (AMs) have gained prominence for their morphological versatility. This review synthesizes two decades of advances in AM development, from fabrication strategies to multifunctional biomedical applications (cell coculture, multidrug delivery, tissue scaffolds, and 3D bioprinting). Systematic analysis of morphology&#8208;dependent effects underscores opportunities for optimizing AM utilization and establishing morphology&#8208;driven innovation frameworks in biomedicine.








Abstract
Anisotropic microcarriers (AMs) have attracted increasing attention. Although significant efforts have been made to explore AMs with various morphologies, their full potential is yet to be realized, as most studies have primarily focused on materials or fabrication methods. A thorough analysis of the interactional and interdependent relationships between these factors is required, along with proposed countermeasures tailored for researchers from various backgrounds. These countermeasures include specific fabrication strategies for various morphologies and guidelines for selecting the most suitable AM for certain biomedical applications. In this review, a comprehensive summary of AMs, ranging from their fabrication methods to biomedical applications, based on the past two decades of research, is provided. The fabrication of various morphologies is investigated using different strategies and their corresponding biomedical applications. By systematically examining these morphology&#8208;dependent effects, a better utilization of AMs with diverse morphologies can be achieved and clear strategies for breakthroughs in the biomedical field are established. Additionally, certain challenges are identified, new frontiers are opened, and promising and exciting opportunities are provided for fabricating functional AMs with broad implications across various fields that must be addressed in biomaterials and biotechnology.

         <title>Cartilage&#8208;Adaptive Hydrogels via the Synergy Strategy of Protein Templating and Mechanical Training</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fabricated oriented chitosan nanofibrillar hydrogels (O&#8208;CN gels), via the synergy strategy of protein templating and mechanical training, achieve cartilage&#8208;like structure and mechanical performances, as well as high&#8208;water retention similar to cartilage. The resulting O&#8208;CN gels has excellent prospects in load&#8208;bearing cartilage engineering application.








Abstract
Cartilage, as a load&#8208;bearing tissue with high&#8208;water content, exhibits excellent elasticity and high strength. However, it is still a grand challenge to develop cartilage&#8208;adaptive biomaterials for replacement or regeneration of damaged cartilage tissue. Herein, protein templating and mechanical training is integrated to fabricate crystal&#8208;mediated oriented chitosan nanofibrillar hydrogels (O&#8208;CN gels) with similar mechanical properties and water content of cartilage. The O&#8208;CN gels with an &#8776;74 wt% water content exhibit high tensile strength (&#8776;15.4 MPa) and Young's modulus (&#8776;24.1 MPa), as well as excellent biocompatibility, antiswelling properties, and antibacterial capabilities. When implanted in the box defect of rat's tails, the O&#8208;CN gels seal the cartilage (annulus fibrosus) defect, maintain the intervertebral disc height and finally prevent the nucleus herniation. This synergy strategy of protein templating and mechanical training opens up a new possibility to design highly mechanical hydrogels, especially for the replacement and regeneration of load&#8208;bearing tissues.

         <title>Multimodal Finger&#8208;Shaped Tactile Sensor for Multi&#8208;Directional Force and Material Identification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A finger&#8208;shaped tactile sensor inspired by human fingers is developed, capable of simultaneous normal and shear force detection and 98.33% accurate material identification. Integrated into a robot hand and arm system, it enables real&#8208;time detection of gripping force, material identification, advancing haptic sensing in robotics.








Abstract
Multimodal tactile perception is crucial for advancing human&#8211;computer interaction, but real&#8208;time multidimensional force detection and material identification remain challenging. Here, a finger&#8208;shaped tactile sensor (FTS) based on the triboelectric effect is proposed, capable of multidirectional force sensing and material identification. The FTS is composed of an external material identification section and an internal force sensing section. Three materials are embedded into the surface of the silicone shell in the fingerpad, forming single&#8208;electrode sensors for material identification. In the force sensing section, the silicone shell's outer surface is coated with conductive silver paste as a shielding layer. The inner wall has four silicone microneedle arrays and a silicone bump, while five silver electrodes are coated on the internal polylactic acid skeleton. The components connect via interlocking structures near the fingernail, allowing localized contact and separation between the silicone shell and skeleton, enabling force direction detection through signals from the five electrodes. Additionally, the outer sensors achieve 98.33% accuracy in recognizing 12 materials. Furthermore, integrated into a robotic hand, the FTS enables real&#8208;time material identification and force detection in an intelligent sorting environment. This research holds great potential for applications in tactile perception for intelligent robotics.

         <title>Visible Periodic Piezoelectric Domains in Silk Fibroin for Neurite&#8208;Orientated Extension</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The piezoelectric SF film with visible periodic piezoelectric domains and excellent biocompatibility is fabricated through a feasible photochemical method with silver nanoparticles as the developer and mediator simultaneously. Consequently, the oriented piezoelectric electric field is achieved under ultrasound and effectively regulates the directional growth and length of neurite and neural gene expression.








Abstract
The development of visible periodic piezoelectric domains is highly attractive but challenging to overcome the homogeneous distribution and lack of visualization of the electric field on traditional piezopolymers. This work reports an in situ synthesis to create customized silver patterns with micron&#8208;level distinguishability. This method serves to form visible periodic piezoelectric domains and endows the silk fibroin (SF) piezoelectric generator with maximum root mean square current, energy density, and voltage of 5.1&#160;mA, 6.7&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2 and 529.5&#160;mV, respectively, under an ultrasound intensity of 1.0&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2. The oriented piezoelectric electric field is periodically distributed into the SF film with ultrasound&#8208;driven assistance and remarkably regulates neurite directional growth, length, and gene expression. Additionally, these piezoelectric domains enable the direct and timely observation of the electric field's effect on neurites by biological microscopy. This approach paves the way for great potential in tailored electric stimulation for cell biology and medical engineering.

         <title>Eye&#8208;Drop Nano&#8208;Formulation of Catalase Self&#8208;Assembled with Thiolated Chitosan for Effective Treatment of Dry Eye Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An eye&#8208;drop nano&#8208;formulation of catalase self&#8208;assembled with cysteine&#8208;modified chitosan is designed. The obtained nanoparticles after eye&#8208;drop administration could form disulfide bonds with the mucin layer of the team film to achieve enhanced precorneal adhesion, so as to continuously eliminate excessive reactive oxygen species accumulated in the ocular surface to suppress inflammation, resulting in effective treatment of dry eye disease.








Abstract
Dry eye disease (DED), the most prevalent ophthalmological condition worldwide, can cause severe ocular discomfort and even visual impairment. Effective yet safe therapeutics for severe DED are still highly demanded. Herein, considering the important role of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) in triggering DED, an eye&#8208;drop nano&#8208;formulation of catalase (CAT) self&#8208;assembled with cysteine&#8208;modified chitosan (CS&#8208;Cys) is designed for DED treatment. Upon eye&#8208;drop administration of CS&#8208;Cys/CAT nanoparticles, CS&#8208;Cys can form disulfide bonds with abundant thiols in the mucin layer of the tear film, anchoring catalase to the corneal surface. Thus the excess ROS accumulated on the ocular surface can be effectively eliminated, resulting in a regulated tear microenvironment. In mouse and rabbit models, it is verified that CS&#8208;Cys/CAT eye drops can offer excellent therapeutic effects, especially in promoting the recovery of damaged epithelium and increasing tear secretion. Remarkably, CS&#8208;Cys/CAT eye drops showed notably better therapeutic performance than clinically used cyclosporin and dexamethasone, as well as several new DED drugs in clinical trials. Thus, the work presents a unique nanoparticulate eye&#8208;drop&#8208;based ocular delivery system to allow prolonged ocular retention of protein therapeutics, and such nanoformulation formulated by fully biocompatible/biodegradable components possesses significant translational potential for effective and safe DED treatment.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Ionic Engineering of Antiferromagnetically RKKY&#8208;Coupled Multilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial antiferromagnetically coupled multilayered heterostructures with tailored interlayer exchange interactions and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy hold great promise for applications such as magnetic random&#8208;access memory, magnetic sensors, and spintronics. Voltage&#8208;driven ion migration (i.e., magneto&#8208;ionics) enables post&#8208;synthesis tuning of these magnetic stacks, allowing significant modulation of the various switching events and transitions between antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferrimagnetic (FiM) states.








Abstract
Voltage&#8208;driven ion motion offers a powerful means to modulate magnetism and spin phenomena in solids, a process known as magneto&#8208;ionics, which holds great promise for developing energy&#8208;efficient next&#8208;generation micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;electronic devices. Synthetic antiferromagnets (SAFs), consisting of two ferromagnetic layers coupled antiferromagnetically via a thin non&#8208;magnetic spacer, offer advantages such as enhanced thermal stability, robustness against external magnetic fields, and reduced magnetostatic interactions in magnetic tunnel junctions. Despite its technological potential, magneto&#8208;ionic control of antiferromagnetic coupling in multilayers (MLs) has only recently been explored and remains poorly understood, particularly in systems free of platinum&#8208;group metals.

&lt;p&gt;Artificial antiferromagnetically coupled multilayered heterostructures with tailored interlayer exchange interactions and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy hold great promise for applications such as magnetic random-access memory, magnetic sensors, and spintronics. Voltage-driven ion migration (i.e., magneto-ionics) enables post-synthesis tuning of these magnetic stacks, allowing significant modulation of the various switching events and transitions between antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferrimagnetic (FiM) states.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voltage-driven ion motion offers a powerful means to modulate magnetism and spin phenomena in solids, a process known as magneto-ionics, which holds great promise for developing energy-efficient next-generation micro- and nano-electronic devices. Synthetic antiferromagnets (SAFs), consisting of two ferromagnetic layers coupled antiferromagnetically via a thin non-magnetic spacer, offer advantages such as enhanced thermal stability, robustness against external magnetic fields, and reduced magnetostatic interactions in magnetic tunnel junctions. Despite its technological potential, magneto-ionic control of antiferromagnetic coupling in multilayers (MLs) has only recently been explored and remains poorly understood, particularly in systems free of platinum-group metals. In this work, room-temperature voltage control of Ruderman&#8211;Kittel&#8211;Kasuya&#8211;Yosida (RKKY) interactions in Co/Ni-based SAFs is achieved. Transitions between ferrimagnetic (uncompensated) and antiferromagnetic (fully compensated) states is observed, as well as significant modulation of the RKKY bias field offset, emergence of additional switching events, and formation of skyrmion-like or pinned domain bubbles under relatively low gating voltages. These phenomena are attributed to voltage-driven oxygen migration in the MLs, as confirmed through microscopic and spectroscopic analyses. This study underscores the potential of voltage-triggered ion migration as a versatile tool for post-synthesis tuning of magnetic multilayers, with potential applications in magnetic-field sensing, energy-efficient memories and spintronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A High&#8208;Rate and Ultrastable Ammonium Ion&#8208;Air Battery Enabled by the Synergy of ORR and NH4+ Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the synergistic interplay between oxygen reduction reaction and NH4+ storage, and harnesses the synergy for the successful development of a high&#8208;rate and highly stable ammonium ion air battery (AIAB). The assembled AIAB demonstrates outstanding rate performance (89 mAh g&#8722;1 at 15 A g&#8722;1), high energy density (78 Wh kg&#8722;1 at 9369 W kg&#8722;1), and exceptional cycling stability at 10 A g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Ammonium ion batteries (AIBs) offer cost&#8208;effectiveness, nontoxicity, and eco&#8208;friendly attributes in energy storage technology. However, the constrained capacity and poor stability of conventional cathode materials have impeded their widespread adoption. Herein, a synergistic approach is introduced to overcome these challenges, by enhancing the air cathode with NH4+ and simultaneously leveraging atmospheric oxygen as a reservoir for NH4+ storage. Notably, NH4+ significantly enhances the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance in neutral environments. Through in situ Raman spectroscopy and quantum density functional theory calculations, it is elucidated how NH4+ can act as a proton donor, replacing H2O in neutral media and reducing energy barriers in the protonation of *O2&#8722; and *O, thereby accelerating ORR kinetics. The resulting ammonium ion&#8208;air battery, comprising an air cathode and a polymer (PNP) anode, showcases impressive metrics: high energy density of 78 Wh kg&#8722;1 and power density of 9369 W kg&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1, an initial capacity of 94.3 mAh g&#8722;1 and exceptional cycling stability (70.4% capacity retention after 12&#160;500 cycles) at 10 A g&#8722;1. This pioneering research highlights the synergistic relationship between ORR and NH4+ storage and opens up new avenues for the design and advancement of innovative, sustainable, and environment&#8208;friendly AIBs.

         <title>Interlocking Antiphase Boundary with 180&#176; Domain Wall in PbTiO3 &#8211; Antiphase Ferroelectric Boundary</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the potential applications of antiphase ferroelectric boundaries (APFBs) in PbTiO3 films due to the sharp, straight morphology and the interlocking feature between antiphase boundaries and 180&#176; conventional domain walls. AFPBs retain a high degree of similarity to conventional domain walls, which may serve as dividers of domains and be used in promising strategy for miniaturizing ferroelectric devices.








Abstract
The ferroelectric domain wall, serving as the boundary between separate data carriers based on domains, has attracted widespread interest due to its distinctive physical properties. Although the domain walls in ferroelectric materials are narrower than those in magnetic materials due to their higher lattice anisotropy, they still account for a considerable proportion in ultrathin films, reducing storage efficiency to some extent. Here, ultrathin antiphase ferroelectric boundaries (APFBs) are presented and validated their feasibility as ferroelectric domain walls. The naturally formed APFB shows a sharp and straight morphology, with the characteristic of interlocking between the antiphase boundary (APB)&#160;and conventional 180&#176; domain wall. The calculations from the density functional theory demonstrate that the APFBs undergo a significant but localized change in electronic structure. They largely retain the characteristics that are consistent with those of conventional domain walls, such as enhanced conductivity, irregular oxygen vacancy trapping energy, and vacancy&#8208;tunable physical properties. Finally, as techniques for precisely controlling the nucleation of APB developing, configurations with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane APFBs used as dividers may provide a promising strategy for miniaturizing ferroelectric devices.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This is a quasi&#8208;dry transfer technique assisted by water vapor intercalation (WVI), which can be effectively used to fabricate high&#8208;quality twisted heterostructures, including monolayer/few&#8208;layer graphene and 2D quasicrystal&#8208;like heterostructure. It also enables the fabrication of suspended 2DMs and high&#8208;performance devices. This technique features excellent scalability, advancing fundamental research on 2DMs, and the fabrication of quantum devices with outstanding performance.









Abstract
Transfer technique has become an indispensable process in the development of two&#8208;dimensional materials (2DMs) and their heterostructures, as it determines the quality of the interface and the performance of the resulting devices. However, how to flexibly and conveniently fabricate two&#8208;dimensional (2D) twisted heterostructures with high&#8208;quality interfaces has always been a formidable challenge. Here, a quasi&#8208;dry transfer technique assisted by water vapor intercalation (WVI) is developed, which can be flexibly used to fabricate twisted heterostructures. This method leverages a charged hydrophilic surface to facilitate WVI at the interface, enabling the clean and uniform detachment of 2DMs from the substrate. Using this method, the twisted monolayer/few&#8208;layer graphene and 2D quasicrystal&#8208;like WS2/MoS2, highlighting the surface/interface cleanness and angle&#8208;controlled transfer method is successfully fabricated. Besides, suspended structures of these 2DMs and heterostructures are fabricated, which offers substantial convenience for studying their intrinsic physical properties. Further, a high&#8208;performance hBN/graphene/hBN superlattice device with the mobility of &#8776;199,000&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 at room temperature is fabricated. This transfer technique ingeniously combines the advantages of dry transfer and wet transfer. Moreover, it features excellent scalability, providing crucial technical support for future research on the fundamental physical properties of 2DMs and the fabrication of quantum devices with outstanding performance.

         <title>Localized and Controllable Mineral Salts Crystallization Enabled by Dye Modified Gold Nanorods with Enhanced Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid materials with enhanced photostability and photothermal properties are prepared by modifying gold nanorods with tailored organic dyes, where plasmonic thermalization and nonradiative relaxation are effectively combined. Using the materials as a reusable energy converter, localized, and controllable photothermal crystallization of biorelevant mineral salts, including NaCl, CaCO3, BaCO3, and SrCO3, is realized using 638 nm laser light.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;Hybrid materials with enhanced photostability and photothermal properties are prepared by modifying gold nanorods with tailored organic dyes, where plasmonic thermalization and nonradiative relaxation are effectively combined. Using the materials as a reusable energy converter, localized, and controllable photothermal crystallization of biorelevant mineral salts, including NaCl, CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, BaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and SrCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is realized using 638 nm laser light.

         <title>Hetero&#8208;Trimetallic Atom Catalysts Enable Targeted ROS Generation and Redox Signaling for Intensive Apoptosis and Ferroptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A typical paradigm to utilize hetero&#8208;trimetallic atom catalysts (CCF TACs@NVs) with a stable symmetrical pyramid structure for catalytic guided apoptosis and ferroptosis&#8208;induced cell death, which is provided by the multi&#8208;enzymes like abilities under effective tumor aggregation, highlighting the application prospects in the biomedical field.








Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play crucial roles in cellular metabolic processes by acting as primary intracellular chemical substrates and secondary messengers for cellular signal modulation. However, the artificial engineering of nanozymes to generate ROS is restricted by their low catalytic efficiency, high toxicity, and off&#8208;target consumption. Herein, hetero&#8208;trimetallic atom catalysts (TACs) anchored on a stable symmetrical pyramid structure are designed in the presence of N and P surface ligands from cross&#8208;linked polyphosphazene interlayer&#8208;coated MIL&#8208;101(Fe). The 3D network TACs with a uniform dispersion of Cu, Co, and Fe hetero&#8208;single atoms effectively tailor the active sites to avoid metal sintering, thereby providing sufficient catalytic activity for ROS blooms. Nanovesicle membranes facilitate the stable accumulation of nanozymes with homologous targeting, recognition, and endocytosis, effectively addressing the potentially high toxicity and off&#8208;target defects. Therefore, the outcome of the in situ ROS&#8208;bloom acts as a redox signal for directly regulating oxidative stress in the tumor microenvironment. Meanwhile, ROS intervene in the glutathione peroxidase 4, long&#8208;chain acyl&#8208;CoA synthetase 4, and cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase&#8208;3 pathways as second messengers, fostering the proclivity toward apoptosis and lipid peroxidation&#8208;regulated ferroptosis pathway concurrently, thereby highlighting the application prospects of TACs in the biomedical field.

         <title>Multicolor Rare&#8208;Earth Film with Ultra&#8208;Long Afterglow for Diverse Energy&#8208;Saving Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study fabricates a large&#8208;area multicolor rare&#8208;earth afterglow film via electrospinning, integrating ZnS and tricolor rare&#8208;earth phosphors to achieve ultra&#8208;long afterglow (&gt;30 h) and tunable emissions. The film exhibits thermoluminescence, environmental stability, and light&#8208;capturing capabilities, enabling applications in fire&#8208;rescue gear, greenhouses, and energy&#8208;efficient tunnel/garage lighting. Its scalable production and cost&#8208;effectiveness advance energy&#8208;saving technologies in agriculture, safety, and urban infrastructure.








Abstract
Rare&#8208;earth afterglow materials, with their unique light&#8208;storage properties, show great promise for diverse applications. However, their broader applicability is constrained by challenges such as poor solvent compatibility, limited luminescent efficiency, and monochromatic emissions. In this study, these limitations are addressed by blending ZnS with various rare&#8208;earth phosphors including (Sr0.75Ca0.25)S:Eu2+; SrAl2O4:Eu2+, Dy3+ and Sr2MgSi2O7:Eu2+, Dy3+ to modulate deep trap mechanisms and significantly enhance both the afterglow and light capture capabilities. Using electrospinning, a large&#8208;area (0.4&#160;m &#215; 3&#160;m) afterglow film is successfully fabricated with tunable colors and an extended afterglow duration exceeding 30 h. This film demonstrates thermoluminescence, enabling potential integration into fire&#8208;rescue protective clothing for enhanced emergency visibility. In greenhouse settings, it effectively supports chlorophyll synthesis and optimizes conditions for plant growth over a 24&#8208;h cycle. For tunnel and garage applications, the film captures and stores light from vehicle headlights at distances of up to 70 meters. The scalability and cost&#8208;effectiveness of this afterglow film underscore its considerable potential for real&#8208;world applications across multiple fields, marking a significant advancement in sustainable illumination technology.

         <title>Revisiting the &#8220;Stick&#8208;Slip&#8221; Process via Magnetism&#8208;Coupled Flexible Sensors with Bioinspired Ridge Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sandwich&#8208;like device for stick&#8208;slip perception is developed, featuring a deformable bioinspired ridge layer with capability of lateral deformation and fast recovery. Coupled with magnetized functionality, the morphological transformation is capable to induce periodical electrical pulses which allows to revisit the stick&#8208;slip process when human fingertip scans across a specific surface.








Abstract
&#8220;Stick&#8208;slip&#8221; phenomenon that occurs when human fingertip scans across a specific surface is essential to perceive the interactions between skin and the surface. Understanding the &#8220;stick&#8208;slip&#8221; behavior is important for bionic flexible system in applications from advanced robotics to intelligent tactile sensors. However, it is often overlooked owing to the limitations to mimic the soft skin that can tangentially deform/recover with informative electrical feedback. Here, a sandwich&#8208;type device with deformable ridge&#8208;layer is proposed to analyze the characteristic of stick/slip states in &#8220;stick&#8208;slip&#8221; process. Specifically, it is observed that fast recovery of the sensing architecture is caused by dynamic slip phase that generates periodical signals based on principle of induction. The results experimentally show that periods of the electrical pulses are dependent on factors such as inherent properties (e.g., modulus and geometry) and operational parameters (e.g., scanning speed and normal load), which is consistent with the theoretical model. Furthermore, it is found that the transition between &#8220;stick&#8208;slip&#8221; and full slip could qualitatively reflect interfacial properties such as moisture, roughness, and topology. It is expected that the results can strengthen the understanding of &#8220;stick&#8208;slip&#8221; behavior when fingertip interacts with a surface and provide guidance of flexible sensor design to enrich the biomimetic perceptions.

         <title>Geometric Design of Interface Structures and Electrolyte Solvation Chemistry for Fast Charging Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small&#8208;grain&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) geometry can provide sufficient paths for excellent Li+ ion supply capacity, and a soft&#8208;solvating electrolyte can enhance the desolvation kinetics of solvated Li+ ions under fast charging conditions. Isobutyronitrile&#8208;based electrolytes provide high discharge capacity during fast charging cycles while mitigating lithium plating on the anode.








Abstract
The grain sizes of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and solvation structure of electrolytes can affect Li+ ion transport across SEI and control the desolvation kinetics of solvated Li+ ions during fast&#8208;charging of Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, the impact of the geometric structure of SEI grains on the fast charging capability of LIBs is rarely examined. Here, the correlation between the SEI grain size and fast charging characteristics of cells is explored, and the desolvation kinetics is controlled by replacing the strongly binding ethylene carbonate (EC) solvent with a weakly binding nitrile&#8208;based solvent under fast charging conditions. The evolution of small grains of SEI to provide sufficient paths for Li+ ion supply can be achieved by the modification of solvation structure in the electrolyte. Additionally, the less resistive SEI composition and low viscosity of isoBN&#8208;containing electrolyte enable a more rapid charging of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/graphite full cells by facilitating the SEI crossing of Li+ ions with less Li plating at a charging rate of 4 C at 25 &#176;C. This work sheds light on solvation structure and interface engineering to enhance the fast charging cycle stability of LIBs for tailorable adoption in transportation sectors.

&lt;p&gt;A small-grain-rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) geometry can provide sufficient paths for excellent Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion supply capacity, and a soft-solvating electrolyte can enhance the desolvation kinetics of solvated Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions under fast charging conditions. Isobutyronitrile-based electrolytes provide high discharge capacity during fast charging cycles while mitigating lithium plating on the anode.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grain sizes of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and solvation structure of electrolytes can affect Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion transport across SEI and control the desolvation kinetics of solvated Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions during fast-charging of Li-ion batteries (LIBs). However, the impact of the geometric structure of SEI grains on the fast charging capability of LIBs is rarely examined. Here, the correlation between the SEI grain size and fast charging characteristics of cells is explored, and the desolvation kinetics is controlled by replacing the strongly binding ethylene carbonate (EC) solvent with a weakly binding nitrile-based solvent under fast charging conditions. The evolution of small grains of SEI to provide sufficient paths for Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion supply can be achieved by the modification of solvation structure in the electrolyte. Additionally, the less resistive SEI composition and low viscosity of isoBN-containing electrolyte enable a more rapid charging of LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/graphite full cells by facilitating the SEI crossing of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions with less Li plating at a charging rate of 4 C at 25 &#176;C. This work sheds light on solvation structure and interface engineering to enhance the fast charging cycle stability of LIBs for tailorable adoption in transportation sectors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Selective Growth of Ultralong Organic Phosphorescence Nanocrystals with Optimized Crystal Forms for In Vivo Optical Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) nanocrystals have attracted great attention in the field of in vivo optical imaging due to their ability to effectively minimize the interference of fluorescence background from biological tissues. In this work, a bottom&#8208;up strategy is proposed for preparing UOP nanocrystals with different crystal forms for in vivo biological imaging.








Abstract
Ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) materials are valuable for biological imaging to avoid interference from fluorescence background signals because of their delayed emission property. Obtaining nanocrystals with high phosphorescence quantum yield is a critical factor to achieve high&#8208;quality UOP imaging. Herein, a pair of host&#8211;guest UOP doped system with variable crystal forms for the host is constructed. By exploring the relationship between the crystal form of the host and the UOP of the doped system, the importance of host crystal form is revealed to achieve high quantum yield UOP in doped systems. Furthermore, to overcome the low crystallinity and numerous defects faced by traditional bottom&#8208;up strategies for nanocrystal preparation, a strategy is proposed for the selective preparation of nanocrystals with the target crystal form. Through controlling the evaporation rate of the solvent, the ordered growth of crystals can be effectively regulated to obtain nanocrystals with different crystal forms for bioimaging applications.

         <title>Synthetic Active Liquid Crystals Powered by Acoustic Waves</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully synthetic active liquid crystal, energized by an acoustic field, is presented. This system exhibits active nematic behavior, tunable topological defect dynamics, and persistent hydrodynamic vortices at high activity levels. The material maintains stable properties while enabling precise activity control in a wide range.








Abstract
Active nematic materials combine orientational order with activity at the microscopic level. Current experimental realizations of active nematics include vibrating elongated particles, cell layers, suspensions of elongated bacteria, and a mixture of bio&#8208;filaments with molecular motors. The majority of active nematics are of biological origin. The realization of a fully synthetic active liquid crystal comprised of a lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal energized by ultrasonic waves, is reported. This synthetic active liquid crystal is free from biological degradation and variability, exhibits phenomenology associated with active nematics, and enables precise and rapid activity control over a significantly extended range. It is demonstrated that the energy of the acoustic field is converted into microscopic extensile stresses disrupting long&#8208;range nematic order and giving rise to an undulation instability and proliferation of topological defects. The emergence of unconventional free&#8208;standing persistent vortices in the nematic director field at high activity levels is revealed. The results provide a foundation for the design of externally energized active liquid crystals with stable material properties and tunable topological defect dynamics crucial for the realization of reconfigurable microfluidic&#160;systems.

         <title>1D Magnetic Topological Inorganic Electrides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of 1D stable magnetic inorganic electrides are identified by high throughput screening and experimental synthesis. Furthermore, these 1D inorganic electrides exhibit various applications, including spintronics, topological electronics, low work function, electron emission, and high&#8208;performance catalysts for NH3 reductions.








Abstract
Inorganic electrides, which are characterized by the presence of interstitial anionic electrons (IAEs) within distinct geometric cavities, exhibit unique properties and have garnered significant attention in various fields. Nevertheless, inorganic electrides face significant challenges in terms of their stability and magnetic topological states. To address these issues, a combination of high&#8208;throughput screening, first&#8208;principles calculations, and experimental synthesis is used to identify a series of stable 1D magnetic topological inorganic electrides with diverse properties and applications. Specifically, 17 ferromagnetic (FM) and 19 antiferromagnetic (AFM) 1D inorganic electrides, with different topological bulk and surface states are reported. Moreover, these 1D inorganic electrides exhibit lower work functions (&#8776;3&#160;eV) on the (001) surface, significantly enhancing their applications in ammonia synthesis. Further experimental synthesis and characterization suggested that 1D inorganic electrides exhibit extremely high stability owing to the strong hybridization between IAEs and atoms and the small surface area of IAEs. These findings involve the screening, investigation, preparation, and application of stable 1D magnetic topological inorganic electrides, heralding a new era in the study of 1D inorganic electrides in topological quantum science, spintronics, energy, and the corresponding interdisciplinary areas.

         <title>LiC6@Li as a Promising Substitution of Li Metal Counter Electrode for Low&#8208;Temperature Battery Evaluation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work developed a LiC6@Li counter electrode, as an alternative to Li metal for more precisely evaluating the electrochemical behavior of electrode materials at low temperatures. The low interfacial resistances facilitate preferential de&#8208;intercalation of Li+ from LiC6, resulting in a sharp decreased over&#8208;potential at low temperatures. Meanwhile, the rapid replenishment of Li+ through the solid&#8211;solid&#8208;connection reaction maintains stable LiC6@Li potential.








Abstract
Li metal, as a counter electrode, is widely used for electrode materials evaluation in coin type half&#8208;cells. However, whether this configuration is suitable for different working conditions has often been neglected. Herein, the large resistance and high cathodic/anodic over&#8208;potential of Li metal at low temperature are highlighted, revealing its incompetence as counter electrode on cryogenic condition. In view of this, a novel LiC6@Li composite electrode is developed as a promising substitution for electrode materials evaluation. In the LiC6@Li electrode, Li+ de&#8208;intercalated from LiC6 preferentially due to the low interface resistance of LiC6, presenting a cathodic/anodic over&#8208;potential of 0.05&#160;V (67&#160;&#181;A cm&#8722;2) at &#8722;20 &#176;C, which is ten times lower than that of Li metal. Moreover, the rapid lithium replenishment into LiC6 from Li metal enables a stable potential of LiC6@Li. Consequently, the LiC6@Li&#8208;based half&#8208;cells enabled more precise evaluation of the Li+ storage potential and specific capacities of a series of electrode materials at low temperature. As an extension, KC8@K is also successfully prepared as a superior counter electrode to K metal. This work proposes a suitable counter electrode for more accurately evaluating electrode materials at subfreezing scenarios, demonstrating the necessity of specialized electrode evaluation systems for particular operating conditions.

A tailor&#8208;made blue organic emitter with hot exciton and aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics serves as a sensitizer in the innovative sensitizing system with a dual&#8208;channel stepwise energy transfer feature. The established material and device approach enables efficient, stable blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with narrow emission and low&#8208;efficiency roll&#8208;off at high luminance.








Abstract
Marching toward next&#8208;generation ultrahigh&#8208;definition and high&#8208;resolution displays, the development of high&#8208;performance blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with narrow emission and high luminance is essential and requires conceptual advancements in both molecular and device design. Herein, a blue organic emitter is reported that exhibits hot&#8208;exciton and aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics, and use it as a sensitizer in the proposed triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA)&#8208;assisted hot&#8208;exciton&#8208;sensitized fluorescence (HSF) device, abbreviated THSF. Results show that through dual&#8208;channel stepwise F&#246;rster and Dexter energy transfer processes, the THSF system can simultaneously enhance exciton utilization, accelerate exciton dynamics, and reduce the concentration of triplet excitons. The smooth management of excitons makes the overall performance of the THSF device superior to the control TTA fluorescence and HSF devices. Furthermore, a high&#8208;performance narrowband blue (CIEx,y = 0.13, 0.12) OLED is achieved using a two&#8208;unit tandem device design, providing an excellent maximum external quantum efficiency of 18.3%, a record&#8208;high L90% (the luminance where the &#414;ext drops to 90% of its peak value) of &#8776;20&#160;000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, and a long half&#8208;lifetime at 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2 initial luminance of &#8776;13&#160;256&#160;h. These results showcase the great potential of the THSF strategy in realizing efficient and stable blue OLEDs with narrow emission and high luminance.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an anisotropic inductive liquid metal sensor (AI&#8208;LMS) inspired by the biomechanical properties of human fingertips. The AI&#8208;LMS demonstrates superior performance in multidimensional pressure sensing, characterized by high linearity and stability. Potential applications encompass enhancing robotic tactile perception and facilitating precise 3D surface scanning, representing a significant milestone in the field of soft robotics technology.








Abstract
The advancement of robotic behavior and intelligence has led to an urgent demand for improving their sensitivity and interactive capabilities, which presents challenges in achieving multidimensional, wide&#8208;ranging, and reliable tactile sensing. Here an anisotropic inductive liquid metal sensor (AI&#8208;LMS) is introduced inspired by the human fingertip, which inherently possesses the capability to detect spatially multi&#8208;axis pressure with a wide sensing range, exceptional linearity, and signal stability. Additionally, it can detect very small pressures and responds swiftly to prescribed forces. Compared to resistive signals, inductive signals offer significant advantages. Further, integrated with a deep neural network model, the AI&#8208;LMS can decouple multi&#8208;axis pressures acting simultaneously upon it. Notably, the sensing range of Ecoflex and PDMS&#8208;based AI&#8208;LMS can be expanded by a factor of 4 and 9.5, respectively. For practical illustrations, a high&#8208;precision surface scanning reconstruction system is developed capable of capturing intricate details of 3D surface profiles. The utilization of biomimetic AI&#8208;LMS as robotic fingertips enables real&#8208;time discrimination of diverse delicate grasping behaviors across different fingers. The innovations and unique features in sensing mechanisms and structural design are expected to bring transformative changes and find extensive applications in the field of soft robotics.

         <title>Durable Proton Exchange Membrane Based on Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity for Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel composite proton exchange membrane (PEM) design that leverages carboxylic acid&#8208;functionalized polymers of intrinsic microporosity (cPIM&#8208;1) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Harnessing Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions enables the development of a synergistic microporous structure that confines phosphoric acid clusters, enhancing proton conductivity and durability. This work addresses critical challenges in PEM development, while proposing a solutionfor&#160;the design of next&#8208;generation membranes.









Abstract
High&#8208;temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells (HT&#8208;PEMFCs) is regarded as a promising energy conversion system owing to simplified water management and enhanced tolerance to fuel impurities. However, phosphoric acid (PA) leaching remains a critical issue, diminishing energy density and durability, posing significant obstacle to the commercial development of HT&#8208;PEMFCs. To address this, composite membranes incorporating the carboxylic acid&#8208;modified polymer of intrinsic microporosity (cPIM&#8208;1) are designed as framework polymer, blended with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) for HT&#8208;PEMFCs. The Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions between cPIM&#8208;1 and PVP created an extensive hydrogen&#8208;bonding network, improving membrane compatibility. The optimized microporous structure and multiple anchoring sites gave rise to &#8220;domain&#8208;limited&#8221; PA clusters, enhancing the capillary effect. Simultaneously, improved hydrophobicity synergistically optimizes catalytic interface, promoting continuous and stable proton transfer. The HT&#8208;PEMFCs based on PVP/cPIM&#8208;1 composite membrane achieved a peak power density of 1090.0&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 160&#160;&#176;C, representing a 152% improvement compared to PVP/PES membrane. Additionally, it demonstrated excellent durability, with a voltage decay of 0.058&#160;mV&#160;h&#8722;1 over 210&#160;h of accelerated stress test corresponds to more than 5000&#160;h of constant current density durability test. This study presents a promising strategy for the development of high&#8208;performance and durable novel membranes in various energy conversion systems.

         <title>Critical Roles of Ultrafast Energy Funnelling and Ultrafast Singlet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation in Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskite Optical Gain Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast broadband photoluminescence spectroscopy provides insights into the lasing dynamics, energy transfer, and singlet&#8208;triplet annihilation in mixed&#8208;layer quasi&#8208;2D perovskites. Rapid energy funnelling to the sites of amplified spontaneous emission occurs within sub&#8208;picosecond timescales. However, the accumulation of triplet excitons effectively quenches incoming singlet excitons, creating a bottleneck in the energy cascade and hindering the development of population inversion.









Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D (Q2D) perovskite possess considerable potential for light emission and amplification technologies. Recently, mixed films containing Q2D perovskite grains with varying layer thicknesses have shown great promise as carrier concentrators, effectively mitigating trap&#8208;mediated recombination. In this strategy, photo&#8208;excitations are rapidly funnelled down an energy gradient to the thickest grains, leading to amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). However, the quantum&#8208;confined Q2D slabs also stabilize the formation of unwanted triplet excitons, resulting in parasitic quenching of emissive singlet states. Here, a novel ultrafast photoluminescence spectroscopy is used to study photoexcitation dynamics in mixed&#8208;layer Q2D perovskites. By analysing spectra with high temporal and energy resolution, this is found that sub&#8208;picosecond energy transfer to ASE sites is accompanied by excitation losses due to triplet formation on grains with small and intermediate thicknesses. Further accumulation of triplets creates a bottleneck in the energy cascade, effectively quenching incoming singlet excitons. This ultrafast annihilation within 200 femtosecond outpaces energy transfer to ASE sites, preventing the build&#8208;up of population inversion. This study highlights the significance of investigating photoexcitation dynamics on ultrafast timescales, encompassing lasing dynamics, energy transfer, and singlet&#8208;triplet annihilation, to gain crucial insights into the photophysics of the optical gain process in Q2D perovskites.

         <title>Lignin&#8208;Based Separators for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries via a Dry Fibrillation Method</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Can lignin revolutionize lithium&#8208;ion battery separators? A single&#8208;layer lignin&#8208;based ultrathin separator (as thin as 15&#160;&#181;m) is fabricated using a dry fibrillation method, enabling exceptional thermal stability, low energy consumption, and full material utilization. Sulfonate functional groups enhance interfacial stability, significantly improving cycling in graphite||NMC811 and Si&#8208;Gr||NMC811 cells. This scalable, sustainable approach paves the way for next&#8208;generation functional separators.








Abstract
Separators are critical components in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), preventing internal short circuits, mitigating thermal runaway, and influencing rate capability and cycling performance. However, current polyolefin separators suffer from limitations, such as high thermal shrinkage, relatively poor wettability, and inadequate long&#8208;term stability, impacting safety and cycle life in critical applications like electric vehicles. Here, a single&#8208;layer lignin&#8208;based ultrathin separator (as thin as 15&#160;&#181;m) with exceptional intrinsic thermal stability and cycling performance is demonstrated. The separator is fabricated using lignosulfonate, a natural polymer derived as a byproduct of chemical pulping and biorefinery processes. By employing a dry fibrillation method, the process achieves low energy consumption and a 100% raw material conversion rate, highlighting its scalability and sustainability. Interfacial studies reveal the improved cycling performance in both graphite||NMC811 and Si&#8208;Gr||NMC811 cells is attributed to the abundant sulfonate functional groups in lignosulfonates, which promote the formation of a sulfur&#8208;rich cathode/solid electrolyte interphases (CEI/SEI) with low resistance in both the cathode and anode. The high thermal stability, manufacturing feasibility, battery performance, and low cost of such lignin&#8208;based separators offer new inspiration for developing next&#8208;generation, single&#8208;layer functional separators tailored for high&#8208;performance LIBs.

         <title>Universally Applicable and Ultra&#8208;Long Life Cyclic Power Generation Induced by Interfacial Ion&#8208;Oscillation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electric power generating cell is developed based on potential difference driven reversible ion migration, which generates ultra&#8208;long life electric output over 8&#8208;month with a high short&#8208;circuit of over 40&#160;mA and output power density of up to 6&#160;W m&#8722;2, surpassing the values reported for many other sorts of typical electricity generators.









Abstract
Sustainable energy supply without relying on external power sources is one of the bottlenecks in achieving self&#8208;supportive wearable electronics and Internet&#8208;of&#8208;things (IoT) systems. Here a new type of universally applicable and ultra&#8208;long life cyclic power generation is developed induced by interfacial redox reaction&#8208;mediated ion&#8208;oscillation, which can provide cycling electric energy in a self&#8208;charging manner without extra pre&#8208;charge. Based on asymmetric manganese dioxide and molybdenum disulfide electrode pairs, the proof&#8208;concept electric potential difference power generating cell (EPDC) offers ultra&#8208;long life electric output over 8&#8208;month testing period for tens of thousands of cycles. A layer&#8208;stacking EPDC unit supplies a high direct current of more than 40&#160;mA and a power density of &#8776;6&#160;W m&#8722;2. Such recyclable power&#8208;generating process mainly relies on reversible ion migration at an asymmetric interface in response to relative variation of electric potentials. The universal applicability of EPDC is validated by a combination of diverse electrode pairs. Large&#8208;scale manufacture of EPDCs is achievable by industry&#8208;compatible auto&#8208;blade coating technology with on&#8208;demand power output, providing a long&#8208;acting power supply platform for self&#8208;charging electronic systems.

         <title>Interfacial Adsorption Layers Based on Amino Acid Analogues to Enable Dual Stabilization toward Long&#8208;Life Aqueous Zinc Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfacial adsorption layers based on N,N&#8208;bis(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)glycine (BHEG) are constructed to inhibit Zn corrosion and polyiodide shuttle by employing an electrolyte additive strategy. These layers stabilize Zn anode via creating a &#8220;H2O&#8208;deficient&#8221; inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) and buffering the interfacial pH, while hindering polyiodide migration at the I2 cathode through ion&#8211;dipole interactions. Attributing to these benefits, a long&#8208;lasting aqueous Zn&#8211;I2 battery is realized.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8211;I2) batteries are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to the merits of low cost and high safety. However, their commercial application is hindered by Zn corrosion and polyiodide shuttle at I2 cathode. Herein, N,N&#8208;bis(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)glycine (BHEG) based interfacial adsorption layers are constructed to stabilize Zn anodes and mitigate polyiodide shuttle according to ion&#8211;dipole interactions, by using a strategy of electrolyte additive. The tertiary amine (N(CH2)3) and carboxyl (&#9472;COO&#8722;) groups in the deprotonated BHEG can reversibly capture H+ and dynamically neutralize OH&#8722; ions, efficiently buffering the interfacial pH of Zn metal anodes and suppressing hydrogen evolution reactions. Additionally, the BHEG adsorption layers can repel 39.3% of H2O molecules at the Zn interface, creating a &#8220;water&#8208;deficient&#8221; inner Helmholtz plane and preventing Zn corrosion. Significantly, the N(CH2)3 groups in BHEG also inhibit polyiodide shuttle at the I2 cathode, which exhibits high adsorption energies of &#8722;0.88, &#8722;0.41, and &#8722;0.39&#160;eV for I&#8722;, I2, and I3&#8722;, respectively. Attributing to these benefits, the Zn&#8211;I2 battery can achieve a high areal capacity of 2.99 mAh cm&#8722;2 and an extended cycling life of 2,000 cycles, even at a high mass loading of I2 cathode (&#8776;21.5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2).

The organohydrogels inherently possess rapid self&#8208;healing ability, exhibit specific temperature&#8208;responsive behavior, and are broadly compatible with a variety of organic solvents and polymers.








Abstract
Organohydrogels have significant applications in numerous fields. The current synthetic strategies generally rely on the intricate and complex design of lipophilic or hydrophilic polymers to achieve the goal of oil&#8208;water interpenetration.

The sub&#8208;nanowires in the oil phase provide structural support, while surfactants in the sub&#8208;nanowires exist at the interface between oil and water, thus forming the water&#8208;in&#8208;oil structure. The organohydrogels possess commendable mechanical properties, an inherent self&#8208;healing ability, and a specific temperature&#8208;responsive behavior. Moreover, the organohydrogels are compatible with a variety of organic solvents and polymers, reserving the promise for wide&#8208;range applications in the future.

         <title>Nose&#8208;to&#8208;Brain Delivery of Circular RNA SCMH1&#8208;Loaded Lipid Nanoparticles for Ischemic Stroke Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and safe circular&#8208;RNA delivery system circSCMH1@LNP1 is developed for direct nose&#8208;to&#8208;brain delivery of circRNA SCMH1 to ischemic lesions. Experiments demonstrate that intranasally administrated circSCMH1@LNP1 significantly accumulates in the peri&#8208;infarct region of PT stroke mice, thereby improving functional recovery by enhancing synaptic plasticity, vascular repair, neuroinflammation relief, and myelin sheath formation.








Abstract
Ischemic stroke represents one of the leading cerebrovascular diseases with a high rate of mortality and disability globally. To date, there are no effective clinical drugs available to improve long&#8208;term outcomes for post&#8208;stroke patients. A novel nucleic acid agent circSCMH1 which can promote sensorimotor function recovery in rodent and nonhuman primate animal stroke models has been found. However, there are still delivery challenges to overcome for its clinical implementation. Besides, its effects on post&#8208;stroke cognitive functions remain unexplored. Herein, lipid nanoparticle circSCMH1@LNP1 is established to deliver circSCMH1 and explore its therapeutic efficacy comprehensively. Distribution experiments demonstrate that intranasal administration of circSCMH1@LNP1 significantly increases circSCMH1 distribution in the peri&#8208;infarct region and reduces its non&#8208;specific accumulation in other organs compared to intravenous injection. Therapeutic results indicate that circSCMH1@LNP1 promotes synaptic plasticity, vascular repair, neuroinflammation relief, and myelin sheath formation, thereby achieving enhanced sensorimotor and cognitive function recovery in post&#8208;stroke mice. In conclusion, this research presents a simple and effective LNP system for efficient delivery of circSCMH1 via intranasal administration to repair post&#8208;stroke brain injury. It is envisioned that this study may bridge a crucial gap between basic research and translational application, paving the way for clinical implementation of novel circSCMH1 in post&#8208;stroke patient management.

         <title>Self&#8208;Regulating the Local Conjugation of Tertiary Aniline toward Highly Stable Polymer Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermo&#8208;electrochemically compatible polymer electrolyte is proposed with a locally conjugated structure through self&#8208;regulation of paired tertiary anilines coupled with in situ polymerization, which significantly reconstructs an improved Li+ solvation and enhances electrode/electrolyte interfacial stability of LMBs. This concept provides an important theoretical basis and technical means for achieving practical high energy/power density LMBs.








Abstract
Pursuing high energy/power density lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with good safety and lifespan is essential for developing next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage devices. Nevertheless, the uncontrollable degradation of the electrolyte and the subsequent formation of inferior electrolyte/electrode interfaces present formidable challenges to this endeavor, especially when paring with transition metal oxide cathode. Herein, a fireproof polymeric matrix with a local conjugated structure is constructed by 4,4&#8242;&#8208;methylenebis (N, N&#8208;diglycidylaniline) (NDA) monomer via in situ polymerization, which promotes the use of ester&#8208;based liquid electrolyte for highly stable LMBs. The conjugated tertiary anilines in this PNDA electrolyte effectively tune the Li+ solvation sheath and generate conformal protective layers on the electrode surfaces, resulting in excellent compatibility with both high&#8208;voltage cathodes and Li&#8208;metal anodes. Moreover, the accumulated electron density endows PNDA with a powerful capability to seize and eliminate the corrosive hydrofluoric acid, which strikingly mitigates the irreversible structure transformation of LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC) particles. As a result, the PNDA&#8208;based Li||LiFePO4 and Li||NMC cells reach excellent electrochemical and safety performance. This study provides a promising strategy for the macromolecular design of electrolytes and emphasizes the importance of &#8220;local conjugation&#8221; within the polymers for LMBs.

         <title>A Strain Relaxation Modulation for Printing High&#8208;performance Flexible Pseudo&#8208;Planar Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rational toughening of photosensitive films is crucial for the development of flexible organic solar cells. Herein, a fine&#8208;grain strengthening strategy is demonstrated for mitigating the excessive aggregation or crystallization in small&#8208;molecule acceptor films, thereby suppressing the non&#8208;ideal thermodynamic behavior and residual&#8208;enriched state. Thus, these provide the potential for the synergistic enhancement of efficiency, mechanical and environmental stability in organic photovoltaics.








Abstract
The rational toughening of photosensitive films is crucial for the development of robust and flexible organic solar cells (F&#8208;OSCs), which are always influenced by mechanical strain and thermodynamic relaxation within the films. Nevertheless, the potential determinants of these properties and quantitative metrics modulating the overall performance of flexible devices have not been thoroughly defined. Herein, a fine&#8208;grain strengthening strategy is demonstrated for mitigating the excessive aggregation or crystallization in small&#8208;molecule acceptor films, the secondary thermal relaxation of side chains in polyethylene oxide (PEO) local motion restricts the free fluctuation volume through hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, thereby suppressing the non&#8208;ideal thermodynamic behavior and residual&#8208;enriched state. These contribute to an increase in yield strength and a reduction in microcracks while enhancing the fracture energy at the donor/acceptor interface. Finally, the optimal F&#8208;OSCs demonstrate champion PCEs of 19.12% (0.04 cm2) and 16.92% (1.00 cm2), and maintain 80% of their initial efficiency after heating at 85 &#176;C for 2600&#160;h. Besides, the flexibility and mechanical robustness of devices are also optimized, the elastic modulus and stiffness are decreased by 50.68% and 5.71%. This work provides interesting references for the synergistic enhancement of efficiency, mechanical and environmental stability in flexible organic photovoltaics.

         <title>Solid Polymer Electrolyte with Compatible Cathode&#8208;Electrolyte Interfacial Design Enabling Lithium Metal Batteries Operation at 4.8&#160;V with Long Cycle Life</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduce a novel approach to enhancing cathode&#8208;SPE compatibility by utilizing the same poly(ionic liquid) (PolyIL)&#8208;based material in both the SPE and the cathode binder. A modified biomass&#8208;based PolyIL substrate, enriched with highly negatively charged C&#9552;O and &#9472;OH groups, is incorporated into the SPE to improve Li+ migration and strengthen its mechanical properties. The Li||LiFePO&#8324; cell, assembled via in situ photopolymerization, demonstrate stable cycling for over 1100 cycles, while the Li||NCM811 cell operated reliably at a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.8 V for 100 cycles.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) offer higher energy density and enhance safety compared to the Li&#8208;ion batteries that use a graphite anode and organic electrolytes. However, achieving long cycle life for LMBs while enabling the use of high&#8208;voltage cathodes required the compatibility between cathode&#8208;SPE, rather than focusing solely on the individual components. This study presente a dual&#8208;functional poly(ionic liquid) (PolyIL)&#8208;based material that simultaneously serves as an SPE matrix and a cathode binder, constructing a cathode&#8208;SPE interface with exceptional (electro)chemical compatibility owing to the high ionic conductivity and wide electrochemical stability window. Additionally, a modified cellulose acetate (CA)&#8208;based PolyIL substrate, enriched with C&#9552;O and &#9472;OH groups, is designed rationally and incorporated to assist the Li+ migration, leveraging their highly negative charge, and enhancing the mechanical strength of the SPE. Furthermore, an in situ polymerization approach is employed to assemble the cells, improving the physical compatibility at the cathode&#8208;SPE interface. As a result, the Li||LFP cell demonstrate stable cycling beyond 1100 cycles, and the Li||NCM811 cell reliably operates at a high cut&#8208;off voltage of up to 4.8&#160;V.

Rhodium&#8208;carbon coordination&#8208;based 2D metal&#8208;organic frameworks are rationally synthesized and exhibit ultra&#8208;narrow bandgaps (0.10&#8211;0.28&#160;eV) and intrinsic charge mobilities up to 560 &#177;&#160;46 cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 via time&#8208;resolved terahertz spectroscopy.








Abstract
2D metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D MOFs) are emerging organic van der Waals materials with great potential in various applications owing to their structural diversity, and tunable optoelectronic properties. So far, most reported 2D MOFs rely on metal&#8208;heteroatom coordination (e.g., metal&#8211;nitrogen, metal&#8211;oxygen, and metal&#8211;sulfur); synthesis of metal&#8208;carbon coordination based 2D MOFs remains a formidable challenge. This study reports the rhodium&#8211;carbon (Rh&#8211;C) coordination&#8208;based 2D MOFs, using isocyanide as the ligand and Rh(I) as metal node. The synthesized MOFs show excellent crystallinity with quasi&#8208;square lattice networks. These MOFs show ultra&#8208;narrow bandgaps (0.1&#8211;0.28&#160;eV) resulting from the interaction between Rh(I) and isocyano groups. Terahertz spectroscopy demonstrates exceptional short&#8208;range charge mobilities up to 560 &#177;&#160;46 cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in the as&#8208;synthesized MOFs. Moreover, these MOFs are used as electrocatalysts for nitrogen reduction reaction and show an excellent NH3 yield rate of 56.0 &#177;&#160;1.5&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 and a record Faradaic efficiency of 87.1 &#177;&#160;1.8%. In situ experiments reveal dual pathways involving Rh(I) during the catalytic process. This work represents a pioneering step toward 2D MOFs based on metal&#8211;carbon coordination and paves the way for novel reticular materials with ultra&#8208;high carrier mobility and for versatile optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Revealing the Coordination and Mediation Mechanism of Arylboronic Acids Toward Energy&#8208;Dense Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arylboronic acids are explored for use in the electrolyte engineering of Li&#9472;S batteries. The theoretically and experimentally verified coordination and mediation chemistry of arylboronic acids can not only stabilize the anode interface but also accelerate the sluggish sulfur conversion. 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylboronic acid (BPBA) is chosen as a suitable electrolyte modifier, significantly improving the electrochemical performance of Li&#9472;S batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#9472;S) batteries offer a promising avenue for the next generation of energy&#8208;dense batteries. However, it is quite challenging to realize practical Li&#9472;S batteries under limited electrolytes and high sulfur loading, which may exacerbate problems of interface deterioration and low sulfur utilization. Herein, the coordination and mediation chemistry of arylboronic acids that enable energy&#8208;dense and long&#8208;term&#8208;cycling Li&#9472;S batteries is proposed. The coordination chemistry between NO3&#8722; and arylboronic acids breaks the resonance configuration of NO3&#8722; and thermodynamically promotes its reduction on the anode, contributing to a mechanically robust interface. The mediation chemistry between lithium arylborate and polysulfides distorts S&#9472;S/Li&#9472;S bonds, alters the rate&#8208;determining step from Li2S4&#8594;Li2S2 to Li2S6&#8594;Li2S4, and homogeneously accelerates the sulfur redox kinetics. Li&#9472;S batteries using 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylboronic acid (BPBA) show excellent cycling stability (1000 cycles with a low capacity decay rate of 0.033% per cycle) and a high energy density of 422&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 under aggressive chemical environments (high sulfur loading of 17.4&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 and lean electrolyte operation of 3.6&#160;mL gS&#8722;1). The basic mechanism of coordination and mediation chemistry can be extended to other arylboronic acids with different configurations and compositions, thus broadening the application prospect of arylboronic acids in the electrolyte engineering of Li&#9472;S batteries.

         <title>Unlocking Multimodal Nonlinear Microscopy for Deep&#8208;Tissue Imaging under Continuous&#8208;Wave Excitation with Tunable Upconverting Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a multimodal nonlinear microscopy approach using upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) under continuous&#8208;wave excitation. The UCNPs exhibit high&#8208;order nonlinear optical responses, enabling deep&#8208;tissue 3D imaging, video&#8208;rate wide&#8208;field imaging, and depth&#8208;selective photomodulation. High&#8208;resolution in vivo imaging of mouse cerebrovascular networks is demonstrated, highlighting the potential for cost&#8208;effective bioimaging and targeted phototherapy applications.








Abstract
Nonlinear microscopy provides excellent depth penetration and axial sectioning for 3D imaging, yet widespread adoption is limited by reliance on expensive ultrafast pulsed lasers. This work circumvents such limitations by employing rare&#8208;earth doped upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs), specifically Yb3+/Tm3+ co&#8208;doped NaYF4 nanocrystals, which exhibit strong multimodal nonlinear optical responses under continuous&#8208;wave (CW) excitation. These UCNPs emit multiple wavelengths at UV (&#955; &#8776; 450 nm), blue (&#955; &#8776; 450 nm), and NIR (&#955; &#8776; 800 nm), whose intensities are nonlinearly governed by excitation power. Exploiting these properties, multi&#8208;colored nonlinear emissions enable functional imaging of cerebral blood vessels in deep brain. Using a simple optical setup, high resolution in vivo 3D imaging of mouse cerebrovascular networks at depths up to 800 &#181;mm is achieved, surpassing performance of conventional imaging methods using CW lasers. In vivo cerebrovascular flow dynamics is also visualized with wide&#8208;field video&#8208;rate imaging under low&#8208;powered CW excitation. Furthermore, UCNPs enable depth&#8208;selective, 3D&#8208;localized photo&#8208;modulation through turbid media, presenting spatiotemporally targeted light beacons. This innovative approach, leveraging UCNPs' intrinsic nonlinear optical characteristics, significantly advances multimodal nonlinear microscopy with CW lasers, opening new opportunities in bio&#8208;imaging, remote optogenetics, and photodynamic therapy.

         <title>Establishing Nanoscale Circuitry by Designing a Structure with Atomic Short&#8208;range Order for High&#8208;Rate Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microsized perovskite oxide Ce0.266W0.1Nb0.9O3 is engineered as an anode material for high&#8208;rate, long&#8208;life Li+ storage, demonstrating impressive performance by maintaining both high areal capacity and high rate capability, even at high mass loadings. This outstanding electrochemical behavior is primarily attributed to the nanoscale circuitry formed by an atomic&#8208;scale short&#8208;range order structure.








Abstract
High&#8208;rate materials necessitate the rapid transportation of both electrons and ions, a requirement that becomes especially challenging at practical mass loadings (&gt;10 mg cm2). To address this challenge, a material is designed with an architecture having atomic&#8208;scale short&#8208;range order. This design establishes internal nanoscale circuitry at the particle level, which facilitates rapid electronic and ionic transport within micrometer&#8208;sized niobium tungsten oxides. The architecture features alternating cerium&#8208;depleted and cerium&#8208;enriched regions. The continuous cerium&#8208;enriched regions with enhanced conductivity provide multilane highways for electron mobility by functioning as electron&#8208;conducting wires that significantly boost the overall conductivity. The cerium&#8208;depleted regions effectively mitigate electrostatic repulsion and promote rapid ion transport through ion&#8208;conducting channels. These structural characteristics provide a continuous network that supports both electrical migration and chemical diffusion to amplify the areal capacity and rate capability even at high mass loadings. These findings not only expand the fundamental understanding of the design of optimal host lattices for advanced energy storage systems but also of the practical application of microsized high&#8208;rate electrode materials.

         <title>Regulating Interfacial H2O Activity and H2 Bubbles by Core/Shell Nanoarrays for 800 h Stable Alkaline Seawater Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To concurrently improve activity and stability for seawater electrolysis under high current densities, the problems of firm adherence and coverage of H2 bubbles with core/shell nanoarrays, addressed which further regulates the interfacial H2O activity to reduce overpotentials, hence highlighting its potential as a sustainable and economically feasible application for large&#8208;scale hydrogen production.








Abstract
The catalytic activity and stability under high current densities for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) are impeded by firm adherence and coverage of H2 bubbles to the catalytic sites. Herein, we systematically synthesize core/shell nanoarrays to engineer bubble transport channels, which further remarkably regulate interfacial H2O activity, and swift H2 bubble generation and release. The self&#8208;supported catalyst holds uniform ultra&#8208;low Ru active sites of 0.38&#160;wt% and promotes the rapid formation of plentiful small H2 bubbles, which are rapidly released by the upright channels, mitigating the blockage of active sites and avoiding surface damage from bubble movements. As a result, these core/shell nanoarrays achieve ultralow overpotentials of 18 and 24 mV to reach 10 mA cm&#8722;2 for HER in 1 M KOH freshwater and seawater, respectively. Additionally, the assembled electrolyzer demonstrates stable durability over 800 hours with a high current density of 2 A cm&#8722;2 in 1 M KOH seawater. The techno&#8208;economic analysis (TEA) indicates that the unit cost of the hydrogen production system is nearly half of the DOE's (Department of Energy) 2026 target. Our work addresses the stability challenges of HER and highlights its potential as a sustainable and economically feasible solution for large&#8208;scale hydrogen production of seawater.

         <title>Linear Dielectric Polymers with Ferroelectric&#8208;Like Crystals for High&#8208;Temperature Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals the pivotal role of ferroelectric&#8208;like crystals in boosting the high&#8208;temperature capacitive energy storage of polynorbornene dielectrics. This distinctive characteristic enables the polymers to exhibit an impressive high&#8208;temperature discharge energy density of 6.76 J cm&#8722;3, even under electric fields that are far below their Weibull breakdown strength.








Abstract
Achieving optimal capacitive energy storage performance necessitates the integration of high energy storage density, typical of ferroelectric dielectrics, with the low polarization loss associated with linear dielectrics. However, combining these characteristics in a single dielectric material is challenging due to the inherent contradictions between the spontaneous polarization of ferroelectric dielectrics and the adaptability of linear dielectrics to changes in the electric field. To address this issue, a linear isotactic sulfonylated polynorbornene dielectric characterized by ferroelectric&#8208;like crystals has been developed. The sulfonyl dipoles in the ferroelectric&#8208;like crystals are oriented in the same direction, thereby enabling this polymer to exhibit a considerable dielectric constant (7.5) at room temperature. Notably, when the operating temperature surpasses the polymer's glass transition temperature (Tg &#8776; 140 &#176;C), its dielectric constant rises to 12 with just minor changes in the dissipation factor. At 150 &#176;C, 90% efficiency of the discharge energy density reaches as high as 6.76 J&#160;cm&#8722;1 under a low electric field of 320 MV m&#8722;1, which is ten times that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, high&#8208;temperature, capacitor&#8208;grade polyetherimide. The enhancement of high&#8208;temperature capacitive performance, achieved by utilizing the crystallinity of isotactic polymers to form a polar structure, presents a new perspective for the design of high&#8208;temperature dielectric polymers.

         <title>TREM2 scFv&#8208;Engineering Escherichia coli Displaying Modulation of Macrophages to Boost Cancer Radio&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ionizing radiation&#8208;responsive delivery system is designed for the precise expression of anti&#8208;TREM2 single&#8208;chain antibody fragments (scFv) using an engineered probiotic, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN), to modulate immunotherapy.








Abstract
Preoperative neoadjuvant radio&#8208;chemotherapy is a cornerstone in the treatment of low rectal cancer, yet its effectiveness can be limited by the insensitivity of some patients, profoundly impacting their quality of life. Through preliminary research, it is found that TREM2+ macrophages play a pivotal role in the non&#8208;responsiveness to immunotherapy. To address this challenge, a novel ionizing radiation&#8208;responsive delivery system is developed for the precise expression of anti&#8208;TREM2 single&#8208;chain antibody fragments (scFv) using an engineered probiotic, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN), to modulate immunotherapy. The released anti&#8208;TREM2 scFv can be precisely targeted and delivered to the tumor site via the engineered EcN outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), thereby reversing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and enhancing tumor therapeutic efficiency when used in combination with the &#945;PD&#8208;L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor. Additionally, these engineered bacteria can be further modified to enhance the intestinal colonization capabilities through oral administration, thereby regulating the gut microbiota and its metabolic byproducts. Consequently, the ionizing radiation&#8208;responsive drug delivery system based on the engineered bacteria not only introduces a promising new therapeutic option for low rectal cancer but also showcases the potential to finely tune immune responses within the intricate tumor microenvironment, paving the way for innovative strategies in tumor radio&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <dc:description>
Implantable devices rely on batteries that demand surgical replacement, posing risks, and financial burdens. Ultrasound energy transfer (US&#8208;ET) offers a revolutionary wireless alternative but struggles with efficiency. The presented dielectric&#8208;ferroelectric&#8208;boosted US&#8208;TENG (US&#8208;TENGDF&#8208;B) is thin, flexible, and biocompatible that provides high&#8208;efficiency and stable power delivery in curved positions, fostering a future of noninvasive and sustainable wireless energy transfer solutions for biomedical applications.








Abstract
Wireless powering of rechargeable&#8208;implantable medical devices presents a challenge in developing reliable wireless energy transfer systems that meet medical safety and standards. Ultrasound&#8208;driven triboelectric nanogenerators (US&#8208;TENG) are investigated for various medical applications, including noninvasive percutaneous wireless battery powering to reduce the need for multiple surgeries for battery replacement. However, these devices often suffer from inefficiency due to limited output performance and rigidity. To address this issue, a dielectric&#8208;ferroelectric boosted US&#8208;TENG (US&#8208;TENGDF&#8208;B) capable of producing a high output charge with low&#8208;intensity ultrasound and a long probe distance is developed, comparatively. The feasibility and output stability of this deformable and augmented device is confirmed under various bending conditions, making it suitable for use in the body's curved positions or with electronic implants. The device achieved an output of &#8776;26&#160;V and &#8776;6.7&#160;mW output for remote charging of a rechargeable battery at a 35&#160;mm distance. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the output&#8208;augmented US&#8208;TENG for deep short&#8208;term wireless charging of implantable electronics with flexing conditions in curved devices such as future total artificial hearts.

         <title>Ultraviolet Optoelectronic Synapse Based on AlScN/p&#8208;i&#8208;n GaN Heterojunction for Advanced Artificial Vision Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Researchers have developed a two&#8208;terminal AlScN/p&#8208;i&#8208;n GaN heterojunction ferroelectric memristor with ultraviolet photoelectric synapse function, enabling nonvolatile memory and optoelectronic synaptic characteristics. This innovation achieves a high memory on/off ratio and a relatively low synaptic energy consumption, advancing optoelectronics and artificial vision systems with potential applications in on&#8208;chip sensing and computing.








Abstract
Ferroelectric materials represent a frontier in semiconductor research, offering the potential for novel optoelectronics. AlScN material is a kind of outstanding ferroelectric semiconductor with strong residual polarization, high Curie temperature, and mainstream semiconductor fabrication compatibility. However, it is challenging to realize multi&#8208;state optical responders due to their limited light sensitivity. Here, a two&#8208;terminal AlScN/p&#8208;i&#8208;n GaN heterojunction ultraviolet optoelectronic synapse is fabricated, overcoming this limitation by leveraging hole capture at the AlScN/p&#8208;GaN hetero&#8208;interface for multi&#8208;state modulation. The novel structure maintains excellent memristor characteristics based on the ferroelectric of AlScN, realizing an on/off ratio of 9.36&#160;&#215;&#160;105. More importantly, the device can mimic synaptic characteristics essential for artificial vision systems, achieving an image recognition accuracy of 93.7% with a weight evolution nonlinearity of 0.26. This approach not only extends the applications of AlScN in optoelectronics but also paves the way for advanced artificial vision systems with image preprocessing and recognition capabilities. The findings provide a step forward in the development of non&#8208;volatile memories with potential for on&#8208;chip sensing and computing.

         <title>Efficient Photoelectrocatalytic Synthesis of Ammonia by Superionic Conductor with Mixed Ion/Electron Conduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A van der Waals FePS2.66Li0.87 superionic conductor (SIC) with enhanced mixed electronic/ionic conductivity is applied for solar&#8208;driven nitrate conversion to ammonia. The migration of mobile lithium ions between layers significantly promotes the electronic conductivity of FePS2.66Li0.87 SIC, which achieves a remarkable ammonia synthesis yield (134.18&#160;&#181;mol cm&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1) under low bias voltage.








Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) nitrate reduction shows substantial potential for solar&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia (NH3) conversion. However, low electron density and disordered electron conduction of conventional catalysts result in limited performance and low Faraday efficiency. Herein, a FePS2.66Li0.87 superionic conductor (SIC) is developed by introducing lithium ions into van der Waals immobile layered of FePS3 catalyst. This layered crystal framework facilitates high&#8208;concentration lithium ions confinement and long&#8208;range diffusion at room temperature, transitioning the conduction mechanism from electronic to mixed ionic/electronic. The typical nanofluidic ion transport leads to a high ionic conductivity of 16.4 mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature and enhanced electronic conductivity of 5 &#215; 10&#8722;6 S cm&#8722;1. Furthermore, mobile lithium ions within interlayers enhance the interaction between the low&#8208;lying 3dyz orbitals of Fe interacting with 2a2 empty antibonding orbitals of NO3&#8722;. An excellent PEC ammonia production of 134.18&#160;&#181;mol cm&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 with 96.95% Faradaic efficiency is achieved, and the corresponding solar&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 efficiency of 57.13% offers a promising pathway toward sustainable ammonia production.

         <title>Hierarchically Structured Porous Polyamide&#8208;Imide Membrane for Switchable Emulsion Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel amphiphilic polymer Torlon&#8208;based membrane with switchable superwettability is developed using a simple one&#8208;step phase separation method. Its hierarchical porous structure and surface reorganization enable exceptional oil&#8208;water separation with ultrahigh permeance and efficiency. The membrane exhibits excellent antifouling, self&#8208;cleaning, and durability, offering a scalable solution for advanced oily wastewater treatment and beyond.








Abstract
The development of advanced membranes with switchable superwettability has attracted considerable attention for the efficient treatment of oily wastewater. However, challenges persist in designing and fabricating such membranes through straightforward methods. In this study, a novel strategy is presented to design switchable superwettable membranes based on micro/nano&#8208;structured porous surfaces and surface chemical composition reorganization. A commercial amphiphilic polymer, polyamide&#8208;imide (Torlon), is fabricated into a porous symmetric membrane with a hierarchical surface structure using a one&#8208;step non&#8208;solvent&#8208;induced phase separation method. By leveraging the surface reorganization capability of amphiphilic polymers and the hierarchically porous structure, the resulting membranes demonstrate exceptional superamphiphilicity in air, underwater superoleophobicity, and underoil superhydrophobicity. These properties enable ultrahigh permeance and separation efficiency for oil&#8208;in&#8208;water, water&#8208;in&#8208;oil, and crude oil/water emulsions through a gravity&#8208;driven process, eliminating the need for external energy. Furthermore, the membranes exhibit excellent antifouling and self&#8208;cleaning performance, maintaining stable operation over multiple cycles. This work provides an innovative and scalable approach to next&#8208;generation switchable superwettable membranes with broad potential applications in oily wastewater treatment and beyond.

         <title>A Natural Lignification Inspired Super&#8208;Hard Wood&#8208;Based Composites with Extreme Resilience</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Super&#8208;hard wood&#8208;based composites (WBC) are designed and developed inspired by the mesoscale homogeneous lignification process intrinsic to tree growth. This innovative hybrid structure is achieved by leveraging the infusion of low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight phenol formaldehyde resin into the cell walls of thin wood slices, followed by a unique multi&#8208;layer construction and high&#8208;temperature compression.








Abstract
The growing demand for high&#8208;strength, durable materials capable of enduring extreme environments presents a significant challenge, particularly in balancing performance with sustainability. Conventional materials such as alloys and ceramics are nonrenewable, expensive, and require energy&#8208;intensive production processes. Here, super&#8208;hard wood&#8208;based composites (WBC) inspired by the meso&#8208;scale homogeneous lignification process intrinsic to tree growth are designed and developed. This hybrid structure is achieved innovatively by leveraging the infusion of low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight phenol formaldehyde resin into the cell walls of thin wood slices, followed by a unique multi&#8208;layer construction and high&#8208;temperature compression. The resulting composite exhibits remarkable properties, including a Janka hardness of 24&#160;382&#160;N and a Brinell hardness of 40.7&#160;HB, along with exceptional antipiercing performance. The created super&#8208;hard, sustainable materials address the limitations of nonrenewable resources while providing enhanced protection, structural stability, and exceptional resilience. The WBC approach aligns with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by offering extra values for improving personal safety and building integrity across various engineering applications.

Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries
In article number 2502894, Shaoming Huang, Wei Zhang, and co&#8208;workers reveal a novel self&#8208;catalytic conversion reaction mechanism of N&#8208;doped CoTe2 composites (N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC) incorporating 3D low&#8208;tortuosity tunneling structure, self&#8208;catalytic N&#8208;Co bonds, and heterojunction. Acting as the anode in potassium&#8208;ion batteries, the N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC composite accelerates the catalytic conversion kinetics of potassium polytellurides (K5Te3 and K2Te) and achieves an ultralong&#8208;lifespan potassium storage performance over 25000 cycles.

Dew Water Harvesting by Laser Micropatterning
A metallic surface micropatterned with a laser achieves self&#8208;cooling capacity when it faces the night sky thanks to its enhanced infrared emissivity, which triggers water condensation similar to natural dew on leaves. The patterned microgrooves promote condensation as a continuous film rather than dispersed droplets, enabling an efficient and autonomous harvesting of dew water. More details ban be found in article number 2419472 by Pablo Pou&#8208;&#193;lvarez and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Recent Progress in Oxygen Reduction Reaction Toward Hydrogen Peroxide Electrosynthesis and Cooperative Coupling of Anodic Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the recent advances and regulation strategies in the 2e&#8315; ORR and is systematically structured into three main sections: 1) the latest progress of 2e&#8722; ORR in different reaction environments, especially in the acidic and neutral media; 2) microenvironmental modulation, and 3) the coupling system with cathodic 2e&#8722; ORR and other anodic reactions. This review aims to shed light on the exploration of efficient catalysts for 2e&#8211; ORR and systems for building a green energy roadmap.








Abstract
Electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) is a promising alternative to the anthraquinone oxidation process. To improve the overall energy efficiency and economic viability of this catalytic process, one pathway is to develop advanced catalysts to decrease the overpotential at the cathode, and the other is to couple 2e&#8722; ORR with certain anodic reactions to decrease the full cell voltage while producing valuable chemicals on both electrodes. The catalytic performance of a 2e&#8722; ORR catalyst depends not only on the material itself but also on the environmental factors. Developing promising electrocatalysts with high 2e&#8722; ORR selectivity and activity is a prerequisite for efficient H2O2 electrosynthesis, while coupling appropriate anodic reactions with 2e&#8722; ORR would further enhance the overall reaction efficiency. Considering this, here a comprehensive review is presented on the latest progress of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts of 2e&#8722; ORR in different media, the microenvironmental modulation mechanisms beyond catalyst design, as well as electrocatalytic system coupling 2e&#8722; ORR with various anodic oxidation reactions. This review also presents new insights regarding the existing challenges and opportunities within this rapidly advancing field, along with viewpoints on the future development of H2O2 electrosynthesis and the construction of green energy roadmaps.

         <title>3D Bioprinting Models for Glioblastoma: From Scaffold Design to Therapeutic Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The schematic representation highlights the essential components for developing a 3D bioprinted glioblastoma model. It includes key microenvironmental factors, biomaterials, and crosslinking techniques. The integration of bioprinting strategies with GBM&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip models enables the creation of dynamic, physiologically relevant models. A Quality&#8208;by&#8208;Design (QbD) roadmap can ensure consistent 3D bioprinting models focusing on critical bioprinting processes and material properties.









Abstract
Conventional in vitro models fail to accurately mimic the tumor in vivo characteristics, being appointed as one of the causes of clinical attrition rate. Recent advances in 3D culture techniques, replicating essential physical and biochemical cues such as cell&#8211;cell and cell&#8211;extracellular matrix interactions, have led to the development of more realistic tumor models. Bioprinting has emerged to advance the creation of 3D in vitro models, providing enhanced flexibility, scalability, and reproducibility. This is crucial for the development of more effective drug treatments, and glioblastoma (GBM) is no exception. GBM, the most common and deadly brain cancer, remains a major challenge, with a median survival of only 15 months post&#8208;diagnosis. This review highlights the key components needed for 3D bioprinted GBM models. It encompasses an analysis of natural and synthetic biomaterials, along with crosslinking methods to improve structural integrity. Also, it critically evaluates current 3D bioprinted GBM models and their integration into GBM&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip platforms, which hold noteworthy potential for drug screening and personalized therapies. A versatile development framework grounded on Quality&#8208;by&#8208;Design principles is proposed to guide the design of bioprinting models. Future perspectives, including 4D bioprinting and machine learning approaches, are discussed, along with the current gaps to advance the field further.

         <title>Leaf Vein&#8208;Inspired Programmable Superstructure Liquid Metal Photothermal Actuator for Soft Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by plant leaf veins and pulp, this work introduced superstructure (ordered grooves) into liquid metal photothermal actuators for the first time and prepared LM@PI/PDMS programmable photothermal actuators with excellent comprehensive performance utilizing laser etching, including rapid oscillation, rapid response, strong load&#8208;carrying capacity, and excellent stability, which can be utilized to create versatile smart devices and robots.








Abstract
Asymmetric&#8208;expansion photothermal actuators have attracted the attention of researchers owing to their simple structure, superior stability, rapid response, and precise controllability. However, their response speed, deformation capacity, and load&#8208;carrying capacity are mutually constrained by their thickness. Inspired by the veins and pulp in plant leaves, this study uses laser etching to apply a superstructure of ordered grooves to liquid metal (LM) photothermal actuators. The resulting LM@low&#8208;expansion polyimide (4.52&#160;ppm K&#8722;1)/polydimethylsiloxane (LM@PI/PDMS) programmable photothermal actuators demonstrate exceptional performance, including a load&#8208;carrying capacity of 190 times their weight, a rapid oscillation frequency of 19&#160;Hz, a response speed of 60.96 &#177; 3.08&#176;/ s, and a bending angle of 159.05 &#177; 2.52&#176;. Hence, the proposed design resolves the inherent conflict between the load&#8208;carrying capacity and response speed. Furthermore, incorporating LM microspheres into actuators increases their stability and allows them to endure more than 20&#160;800 cycles without damage. The actuators are used to create versatile smart devices and robots, such as photothermally actuated robotic dogs that can function across various terrains. This study provides a novel strategy for the design and fabrication of programmable photothermal actuators and highlights their potential for applications in advanced robotics, which paves the way for their integration into complex environments.

         <title>Achieving a Record Photoluminescence Quantum Yield in Green Light&#8208;Emitting Carbon&#8208;Centered Radicals with Nanosecond Emission Lifetimes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;centered radicals derived from N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, which exhibit hybrid local and charge transfer states, can inhibit the nonradiative channels and open the radiative channels, thereby achieving a record photoluminescence quantum yield with a nanosecond lifetime in green light&#8208;emitting carbon&#8208;centered radicals. This work may open new avenues for designing high&#8208;efficiency doublet emitters in the green range.








Abstract
Organic luminescent radicals possess considerable potential for applications in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs)&#8208;based visible light communication owing to their intrinsic advantages of nanosecond emission lifetimes and spin&#8208;allowed radiative transitions. However, the inherently narrow energy bandgap and multiple nonradiative channels of organic radicals make it difficult to achieve efficient green and blue light&#8208;emitting, which is not conducive to applying visible light communication in diverse fields. In this study, a series of carbon&#8208;centered radicals derived from N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes are designed and synthesized, some of which exhibiting hybrid local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) states that resulting in efficient green emission. The results of photophysical characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the luminescence efficiency is closely related to their emission states. This relationship inhibits the nonradiative channels while simultaneously opening the radiative channels of organic radicals exhibiting HLCT states but not those with locally excited states. Intriguingly, a high photoluminescence quantum yield value of up to 70.1% at 534 nm is observed, which is the highest among green light&#8208;emitting carbon&#8208;centered radicals reported to date. Based on this exceptional result, an OLED device is fabricated and achieved an external quantum efficiency of 8.8%. These results demonstrate its potential application in electroluminescent devices.

         <title>Field&#8208;Free Perpendicular Magnetization Switching Through Topological Surface State in Type&#8208;II Dirac Semimetal Pt3Sn</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A full&#8208;scale field&#8208;free perpendicular magnetization switching driven by spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) is achieved by employing an ultrathin type&#8208;II Dirac semimetal, Pt3Sn. The generation of unconventional SOT is attributed to the spin texture of the topological surface state on the Pt3Sn (111) surface with a z&#8208;polarized spin component.

Abstract
Spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) induced by current is a promising approach for electrical manipulation of magnetization in advancing next&#8208;generation memory and logic technologies. Conventional SOT&#8208;driven perpendicular magnetization switching typically requires an external magnetic field for symmetry breaking, limiting practical applications. Recent research has focused on achieving field&#8208;free switching through out&#8208;of&#8208;plane SOT, with the key challenge being the exploration of new spin source materials that can generate z&#8208;polarized spins with high charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion efficiency, structural simplicity, and scalability for large&#8208;scale production. This study demonstrates field&#8208;free perpendicular switching using an ultrathin type&#8208;II Dirac semimetal Pt3Sn layer with a topological surface state. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the unconventional SOT originates from a spin texture with C3v symmetry, leading to significant z&#8208;polarized spin accumulation in the Pt3Sn (111) surface, enabling the deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization. These results highlight the potential of Dirac semimetals like Pt3Sn as scalable and efficient spin sources, facilitating the development of low&#8208;power, high&#8208;density spintronic memory and logic devices.

         <title>Improved Facet and Edge Passivation in Near&#8208;Infrared III&#8208;V Colloidal Quantum Dot Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Increasing InAs CQD size exposes diverse facets and edges, bringing challenges for effective passivation. This work introduces a mixed&#8208;halide passivation strategy to stabilize these facets and edges, doubling anti&#8208;oxidation ability and boosting mobility. The resulting photodetectors achieve 75% EQE, 10 ns response time, and 50&#160;h operational stability (10% loss) at 1140 nm, advancing InAs CQD photodetector performance.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;free III&#8208;V colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are of significant interest for their potential in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) to short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) photodetection. However, achieving effective surface passivation remains challenging, especially as larger CQD sizes introduce more complex surface facets and compositions while shifting the absorption peak from the NIR to the SWIR range. In this study, a mixed&#8208;halide passivation strategy is developed for large InAs CQDs, an approach that led to a doubling in anti&#8208;oxidation ability and achieves a hole mobility of 0.03 cm2&#160;Vs&#8722;1. These in turn led to a T90 lifetime of 50&#160;h and enhanced operating stability in photodetectors operating at 1140&#160;nm. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations and facet characterization indicate that exposed facets and edges are well passivated using a mixture of indium halides, which provide a stronger desorption energy compared to single&#8208;halide passivation. This approach yields photodetectors with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 75% and a response time of 10&#160;ns, an advance for InAs photodetectors operating at 1140&#160;nm.

         <title>Van der Waals Ferroelectric CuCrP2S6&#8208;Enabled Hysteresis&#8208;Free Negative Capacitance Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores 2D ferroelectric CuCrP2S6 for developing advanced NC&#8208;FET technology. Using MoS2 as the channel material, NC&#8208;FETs with optimized capacitance matching conditions achieve ultra&#8208;steep subthreshold swings (12 mV dec&#8722;1) and negligible hysteresis. A resistor&#8208;loaded inverter operating at 0.2 V with hysteresis&#8208;free characteristics highlights the potential of engineered 2D ferroelectrics for next&#8208;generation low&#8208;power electronics.








Abstract
The relentless pursuit of miniaturization and reduced power consumption in information technology demands innovative device architectures. Negative capacitance field&#8208;effect transistors (NC&#8208;FETs) offer a promising solution by harnessing the negative capacitance effect of ferroelectric materials to amplify gate voltage and achieve steep subthreshold swings (SS). In this work, 2D van der Waals (vdW) ferroelectric CuCrP2S6 (CCPS) is employed as the gate dielectric to realize hysteresis&#8208;free NC&#8208;FETs technology. Scanning microwave impedance microscopy (sMIM) is employed to investigate the dielectric property of CCPS, revealing a thickness&#8208;independent dielectric constant of &#8776;35. Subsequently, NC&#8208;FETs are fabricated with MoS2 channel, and the capacitance matching conditions are meticulously investigated. The optimized devices exhibit simultaneously ultra&#8208;steep SS (&#8776;12&#160;mV dec&#8722;1) and negligible hysteresis, with immunity to both voltage scan range and scan rate. Finally, a resistor&#8208;loaded inverter is demonstrated manifesting a low operation voltage down to 0.2&#160;V and hysteresis&#8208;free transfer characteristics. This work paves the way for the development of high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;power electronics by exploiting 2D vdW ferroelectric materials.

The electricity generated by this device can be harnessed for nerve stimulation to enable precise control over bioelectrical stimulation and physiological blood pressure signals.








Abstract
Harnessing engineered living materials for energy application represents a promising avenue to sustainable energy conversion and storage, with bio&#8208;batteries emerging as a pivotal direction for sustainable power supply. Whereas, the realization of miniaturized and portable bio&#8208;battery orchestrating off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf devices remains a significant challenge. Here, this work reports the development of a miniaturized and portable bio&#8208;battery using living hydrogels containing conductive biofilms encapsulated in an alginate matrix for nerve stimulation. These hydrogels, which can be 3&#8208;D printed into customized geometries, retained biologically active characteristics, including electroactivity that facilitates electron generation and the reduction of graphene oxide. By fabricating the living hydrogel into a standard 2032 battery shell with a diameter of 20&#160;mm, this work successfully creates a miniaturized and portable bio&#8208;battery with self&#8208;charging performance. The device demonstrates remarkable electrochemical performance with a coulombic efficiency of 99.5% and maintains high cell viability exceeding 90% after operation. Notably, the electricity generated by the bio&#8208;battery can be harnessed for nerve stimulation to enable precise control over bioelectrical stimulation and physiological blood pressure signals. This study paves the way for the development of novel, compact, and portable bio&#8208;energy devices with immense potential for future advancements in sustainable energy technologies.

         <dc:description>
Creating sulfur&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich tungsten sulfide into composite polymer electrolyte enables homogeneous high&#8208;throughput Li&#8208;ion transport (ultra&#8208;high ionic conductivity of 1.9 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C) and uniform lithium deposition (ultra&#8208;long lifetime of over 5500 h in Li||Li cells). The sulfurized polyacrylonitrile||Li solid pouch cell exhibits an initial discharge&#8208;specific capacity of 1048 mAh g&#8722;1, resulting in a total capacity of 0.524 Ah.








Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes are emerging as a key component for solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries, offering a promising combination of large&#8208;scale processability and high safety.

&lt;p&gt;Solid polymer electrolytes are emerging as a key component for solid-state lithium metal batteries, offering a promising combination of large-scale processability and high safety. However, challenges remain, including limited ion transport and the unstable solid electrolyte interphase, which result in unsatisfactory ionic conductivity and uncontrollable lithium dendrite growth. To address these issues, a high-throughput Li-ion transport pathway is developed by incorporating tungsten sulfide enriched with sulfur vacancies (SVs) into a poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene)-based composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs).

         <title>Efficient Autonomous Dew Water Harvesting by Laser Micropatterning: Superhydrophilic and High Emissivity Robust Grooved Metallic Surfaces Enabling Filmwise Condensation and Radiative Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Laser micropatterning is presented as a promising technology in the search for autonomous dew water harvesting materials. Laser&#8208;grooved metallic surfaces achieve simultaneously high infrared emissivity and superhydrophilicity, which gives them self&#8208;cooling properties under atmospheric radiative deficit and the ability to condense water in an efficient filmwise fashion. An autonomous dew water harvesting system based on those surfaces yields remarkable results.








Abstract
The present work explores a unique yet unexplored synergy between the properties of laser micropatterned metallic surfaces and the requirements for an autonomous dew water harvesting candidate material. Laser&#8208;patterned aluminum surfaces achieved simultaneously high infrared emissivity (up to 0.95 in the atmospheric window) and superhydrophilic wettability (water contact angle of 0&#176;), key properties enabling passive radiative cooling and filmwise condensation dynamics respectively. The generation of micrometric&#8208;sized grooves during laser processing plays a fundamental role in both properties, as they provide a broadband enhancement of the emissivity based on multiscale topographies and oxide layers, while limiting the growth of the water film during condensation through strong capillary wicking forces. As a result, the patterned aluminum surfaces display self&#8208;cooling capacities under radiative deficit conditions as well as low water retention levels (three times lower than the untreated dropwise condensation counterparts). The promising results obtained lead to the construction and evaluation of a real size outdoors autonomous dew water harvesting system based on those surfaces, demonstrating the scalability of the technology. A 70% improvement in the collected dew water in comparison to a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art reference material is consistently measured during 1&#8208;year outdoor study, proving the robustness of the surfaces and their performance.

         <title>Stable and Efficient Indoor Photovoltaics Through Novel Dual&#8208;Phase 2D Perovskite Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of 2D perovskite materials in indoor photovoltaic field is studied. By constructing DJ/RP perovskite heterojunction, an optimal balance between defect passivation and carrier transport is achieved. Ultimately, the 2D PSCs attain a PCE of 30.30%, with working stability improved by a factor of 20 compared to 3D PSCs, demonstrating their significant potential in future indoor photovoltaic technology.








Abstract
2D perovskite materials are ideal candidates for indoor photovoltaic (IPV) applications due to their tunable bandgap, high absorption coefficients, and enhanced stability. However, attaining uniform crystallization and overcoming low carrier mobility remain key challenges for 2D perovskites, limiting their overall performance. In this study, a 2D perovskite light&#8208;absorbing layer is constructed using a Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ)&#8208;phase EDA(FA)4Pb5I16 (n = 5) and introduced butylammonium iodide (BAI) for interface modification, thereby creating a novel DJ/Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) dual 2D perovskite heterostructure. By adjusting the thickness of the BAI&#8208;based perovskite layer, the relationship between interfacial defect states and carrier mobility is investigated under varying indoor light intensities. The results indicate that, by achieving a balance between interfacial defect passivation and carrier transport, the optimized 2D perovskite device reaches a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 30.30% and an open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 936&#160;mV under 1000 lux (3000 K LED). 2D&#8208;DJ/RP perovskite IPV exhibits a twentyfold increase in T90 lifetime compared to 3D perovskite devices. It is the first time to systematically study 2D perovskites in IPV applications, demonstrating that rationally designed and optimized 2D perovskites hold significant potential for fabricating high&#8208;performance indoor PSCs.

         <title>Manipulating Interfacial Water Via Metallic Pt1Co6 Sites on Self&#8208;Adaptive Metal Phosphides to Enhance Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique electrocatalyst featuring singly dispersed Pt&#8211;Co sites in a fully metallic state on nanoporous Co2P, which confers exceptional activity and durability for the hydrogen evolution reaction, enabling high&#8208;performance anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyser, is reported. Real&#8208;time monitoring reveals that these sites self&#8208;adaptively distort under operating conditions to form a Pt1Co6 configuration with strongly negative charge, optimizing reactant binding and reorganizing the interfacial water structure.








Abstract
Metallizing active sites to control the structural and kinetic dissociation of water at the catalyst&#8211;electrolyte interface, along with elucidating its mechanism under operating conditions, is a pivotal innovation for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, a design of singly dispersed Pt&#8211;Co sites in a fully metallic state on nanoporous Co2P, tailored for HER, is introduced. An anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzer equipped with this catalyst can achieve the industrial current densities of 1.0 and 2.0 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.71 and 1.85&#160;V, respectively. It is revealed that the singly dispersed Pt&#8211;Co sites undergo self&#8208;adaptive distortion under operating conditions, which form a Pt1Co6 configuration with a strongly negative charge that optimizes reactant binding and reorganizes the interfacial water structure, resulting in an improved concentration of potassium (K+) ions in the closest ion plane. The K+ ions interact cooperatively with H2O (K&#183;H2O), which strengthens the Pt&#8211;H binding interaction and facilitates the polarization of the H&#9472;OH bond, leading to improved HER activity. This study not only propels the advancement of cathodic catalysts for water electrolysis but also delineates a metallization strategy and an interface design principle, thereby enhancing electrocatalytic reaction rates.

         <title>Enhanced Reversibility of Iron Metal Anode with a Solid Electrolyte Interphase in Concentrated Chloride Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low plating&#8208;stripping Coulombic efficiency of the iron metal anode is a major barrier for next&#8208;generation Fe&#8208;ion batteries. Introducing a high concentration of ZnCl2 to the FeCl2&#8208;based electrolyte makes the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase&#8208;enabling dimethyl carbonate miscible to the electrolyte. The hybrid electrolyte exhibits an average Coulombic efficiency of 98.3% and a more stable cycle life.








Abstract
Iron is a promising candidate for a cost&#8208;effective anode for large&#8208;scale energy storage systems due to its natural abundance and well&#8208;established mass production. Recently, Fe&#8208;ion batteries (FeIBs) that use ferrous ions as the charge carrier have emerged as a potential storage solution. The electrolytes in FeIBs are necessarily acidic to render the ferrous ions more anodically stable, allowing a wide operation voltage window. However, the iron anode suffers severe hydrogen evolution reaction with a low Coulombic efficiency (CE) in an acidic environment, shortening the battery cycle life. Herein, a hybrid aqueous electrolyte that forms a solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the Fe anode surface is introduced. The electrolyte mainly comprises FeCl2 and ZnCl2 as cosalts, where the Zn&#8208;Cl anionic complex species of the concentrated ZnCl2 allows dimethyl carbonate (DMC) to be miscible with the aqueous ferrous electrolyte.

     alt="Enhanced Reversibility of Iron Metal Anode with a Solid Electrolyte Interphase in Concentrated Chloride Electrolytes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The low plating-stripping Coulombic efficiency of the iron metal anode is a major barrier for next-generation Fe-ion batteries. Introducing a high concentration of ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the FeCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based electrolyte makes the solid-electrolyte interphase-enabling dimethyl carbonate miscible to the electrolyte. The hybrid electrolyte exhibits an average Coulombic efficiency of 98.3% and a more stable cycle life.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron is a promising candidate for a cost-effective anode for large-scale energy storage systems due to its natural abundance and well-established mass production. Recently, Fe-ion batteries (FeIBs) that use ferrous ions as the charge carrier have emerged as a potential storage solution. The electrolytes in FeIBs are necessarily acidic to render the ferrous ions more anodically stable, allowing a wide operation voltage window. However, the iron anode suffers severe hydrogen evolution reaction with a low Coulombic efficiency (CE) in an acidic environment, shortening the battery cycle life. Herein, a hybrid aqueous electrolyte that forms a solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the Fe anode surface is introduced. The electrolyte mainly comprises FeCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as cosalts, where the Zn-Cl anionic complex species of the concentrated ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; allows dimethyl carbonate (DMC) to be miscible with the aqueous ferrous electrolyte. SEI derived from DMC's decomposition passivates the iron surface, which leads to an average CE of 98.3% and much-improved cycling stability. This advancement shows the promise of efficient and durable FeIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Binary Electrolyte Additive&#8208;Reinforced Interfacial Molecule Adsorption Layer for Ultra&#8208;Stable Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A natural binary electrolyte additive is designed to achieve an enhanced interfacial molecule adsorption layer for Zn protection via reshaping the electric double&#8208;layer structure. Consequently, the hydrogen evolution reaction is suppressed and a robust inorganic solid electrolyte interphase is constructed for dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating. The zinc ion hybrid capacitor with binary additive demonstrates an exceptional lifespan of over 100&#160;000 cycles.









Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) face challenges due to the limited interface stability of Zn anode, which includes uncontrolled hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and excessive dendrite growth. In this study, a natural binary additive composed of saponin and anisaldehyde is introduced to create a stable interfacial adsorption layer for Zn protection via reshaping the electric double layer (EDL) structure. Saponin with rich hydroxyl and carboxyl groups serves as &#8220;anchor points&#8221;, promoting the adsorption of anisaldehyde through intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Meanwhile, anisaldehyde, with a unique aldehyde group, enhances HER suppression by preferentially facilitating electrocatalytic coupling with H* in the EDL, leading to the formation of a robust inorganic solid electrolyte interphase that prevents dendrite formation, and structural evolution of anisaldehyde during Zn deposition process is verified. As a result, the Zn||Zn symmetric cells present an ultra&#8208;long cycling lifespan of 3&#160;400&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1&#160;700&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Even at the current density of 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, the cells demonstrate reversible operations for 450&#160;h. Furthermore, Zn&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors exhibit a remarkable lifespan of 100&#160;000 cycles. This work presents a simple synergetic strategy to enhance anode/electrolyte interfacial stability, highlighting its potential for Zn anode protection in high&#8208;performance AZIBs.

         <title>Ir/Mn Co&#8208;Mixing and Oxide&#8208;Support Interaction Modulation Through Plasma Promoted Asymmetric Oxygen Coupling for Stable Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy that integrates the Ir/Mn co&#8208;mixing and the strong oxide&#8208;support interaction modulation through plasma defect engineering is used for the development of the catalysts that follow the oxide path mechanism for the oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER). The obtained catalyst shows exceptional OER activity and remarkable stability in the acid media.








Abstract
Developing efficient and stable catalysts that facilitate the oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER) through an oxide&#8208;path mechanism (OPM) is of considerable interest. However, it remains a significant challenge due to the stringent structural requirements of these catalysts. This work reports that using a strategy that integrates the Ir/Mn co&#8208;mixing and the strong oxide&#8208;support interaction (SOSI) modulation, efficient and stable Ir&#8208;based catalysts that follow the OPM for the acidic OER can be developed. The strategy mainly relies on optimizing the distance of oxygeneous intermediate adsorption sites by the Ir/Mn co&#8208;mixing and modulating the SOSI of the catalysts through plasma defect engineering to trigger the OPM pathway with a lower energy barrier. The density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory (DFT) calculations reveal a strong electronic coupling between Ir and Mn via the Ir&#9472;O&#9472;Mn bond and a ready coupling of oxygeneous adsorbed on the Ir site with those on the Mn site, leading to an asymmetric oxygen coupling for the OER. The developed catalyst merely requires an overpotential of 240&#160;mV to drive 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with the Ir mass&#8208;activity &gt;&#160;75 times higher than that of the IrO2. When used in the proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water&#8208;electrolyzers, it shows high performance and excellent stability at an industrial&#8208;level current density of 1.0 A cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Molecular Stitching in Polysaccharide Precursor for Fabricating Hard Carbon with Ultra&#8208;High Plateau Capacity of Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work opens the avenue to molecular&#8208;level modulation in organic precursors for developing high&#8208;performance hard carbon in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The highly cross&#8208;linked polymeric network in the precursor is constructed by unique molecular stitching strategy. The network evolves into highly twisted graphitic lattices with abundant&#160;closed ultramicro&#8208;pores (&lt;0.3 nm), thereby&#160;enabling the storage of massive sodium clusters in hard carbon.








Abstract
High energy density of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) requires high low&#8208;voltage capacity and initial Coulombic efficiency for hard carbon. However, simultaneously achieving both characteristics is a substantial challenge. Herein, a unique molecular stitching strategy is proposed to edit the polymeric structure of common starch for synthesizing cost&#8208;effective hard carbon (STHC&#8208;MS). A mild air&#8208;heating treatment toward starch is employed to trigger the esterification reaction between carboxyl and hydroxy groups, which can effectively connect the branched polysaccharide chains thereby constructing a highly cross&#8208;linked polymeric network. In contrast with the pristine branched&#8208;chain starch, the cross&#8208;linking structured precursor evolves into highly twisted graphitic lattices creating a large population of closed ultramicro&#8208;pores (&lt;0.3&#160;nm) enabling the storage of massive sodium clusters. Resultantly, STHC&#8208;MS delivers a reversible capacity of 348 mAh g&#8722;1 with a remarkable low&#8208;voltage (below 0.1&#160;V) capacity of 294 mAh g&#8722;1, which becomes more attractive by combining the high initial Coulombic efficiency of 93.3%. Moreover, STHC&#8208;MS exhibits outstanding stability of 0.008% decay per cycle over 4800 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. STHC&#8208;MS||Na3V2(PO3)4 full cells achieve an energy density of 266&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, largely surpassing the commercial hard carbon&#8208;based counterpart. This work opens the avenue of molecular&#8208;level modulation in organic precursors for developing high&#8208;performance hard carbon in SIBs.

         <title>Dynamic Bonding for In&#8208;Situ Welding of Multilayer Elastomers Enables High&#8208;Performance Wearable Electronics for Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Active Rehabilitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes an in&#8208;situ self&#8208;welding strategy that uses dynamic hydrogen bonds to integrate multilayer conductive elastomers into robust wearable electronics with superior structural stability and excellent pressure&#8208;sensing performance. The data reflecting resistance training are collected by the welded electronics and further analysed and classified by machine learning models, which enables home&#8208;based active rehabilitation.








Abstract
Patients with hand dysfunction require joint rehabilitation for functional restoration, and wearable electronics can provide physical signals to assess and guide the process. However, most wearable electronics are susceptible to failure under large deformations owing to instability in the layered structure, thereby weakening signal reliability. Herein, an in&#8208;situ self&#8208;welding strategy that uses dynamic hydrogen bonds at interfaces to integrate conductive elastomer layers into highly robust electronics is proposed. This strategy enables the interlocking of functional layers with different microstructures, achieving high interfacial toughness (e.g., &#8776;700&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2 for micropyramid layer with the smallest welding areas) and preventing structural failure. The welded electronics exhibit excellent pressure&#8208;sensing performance, including high sensitivity, a wide sensing range, and excellent long&#8208;term stability, surpassing those of the unwelded electronics. This enables a reliable collection of comprehensive pressure signals during joint rehabilitation, which is beneficial for assessing the rehabilitation levels of a patient. Furthermore, a machine learning&#8208;assisted system using t&#8208;distributed stochastic neighbor embedding and artificial neural network models to facilitate home&#8208;based active rehabilitation is established, which reduces the need for frequent hospital visits.

     alt="Dynamic Bonding for In-Situ Welding of Multilayer Elastomers Enables High-Performance Wearable Electronics for Machine Learning-Assisted Active Rehabilitation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work proposes an in-situ self-welding strategy that uses dynamic hydrogen bonds to integrate multilayer conductive elastomers into robust wearable electronics with superior structural stability and excellent pressure-sensing performance. The data reflecting resistance training are collected by the welded electronics and further analysed and classified by machine learning models, which enables home-based active rehabilitation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with hand dysfunction require joint rehabilitation for functional restoration, and wearable electronics can provide physical signals to assess and guide the process. However, most wearable electronics are susceptible to failure under large deformations owing to instability in the layered structure, thereby weakening signal reliability. Herein, an in-situ self-welding strategy that uses dynamic hydrogen bonds at interfaces to integrate conductive elastomer layers into highly robust electronics is proposed. This strategy enables the interlocking of functional layers with different microstructures, achieving high interfacial toughness (e.g., &#8776;700&#160;J&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for micropyramid layer with the smallest welding areas) and preventing structural failure. The welded electronics exhibit excellent pressure-sensing performance, including high sensitivity, a wide sensing range, and excellent long-term stability, surpassing those of the unwelded electronics. This enables a reliable collection of comprehensive pressure signals during joint rehabilitation, which is beneficial for assessing the rehabilitation levels of a patient. Furthermore, a machine learning-assisted system using &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding and artificial neural network models to facilitate home-based active rehabilitation is established, which reduces the need for frequent hospital visits. This system analyzes and quantifies rehabilitation levels in a timely manner, allowing patients to adjust training programs autonomously, thereby accelerating the rehabilitation process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Shape&#8208;Controlled Reversible Li Plating&#8208;Stripping for Stable and High&#8208;Rate Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A shape change&#8208;free and lithium&#8208;free anode composed of highly ordered hollow ZnO matrix with surface&#8208;protective LiPON layer is developed, which achieves a highly reversible Li plating/stripping inside the matrix cavity for long life&#8208;span anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries with high energy density.









Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries are promising toward high&#8208;energy&#8208;density power sources with low&#8208;cost, but their practical applications are challenged by poor cycling stability and low rate capability. Herein, a shape change&#8208;free and lithium&#8208;free anode that well controls the reversible Li plating&#8208;stripping is reported, which is composed of a highly&#8208;ordered hollow ZnO matrix with a surface&#8208;coated lithium&#8208;phosphorus&#8208;oxynitride (LiPON) layer. The ZnO matrix supplies sufficient cavities and lithiophilic sites to facilitate uniform Li plating/stripping within the hollow cavity, while the LiPON layer maintains stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase from mechanical and electrochemical damage. As a result, lithium is constrained within the cavity and the overall anode shape is effectively controlled during long&#8208;term and high&#8208;rate cycling. The assembled half&#8208;cell stably works at 1.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 335 cycles with Coulombic efficiency of 98.8%. Without Li pre&#8208;deposition, full&#8208;cells using modified&#8208;LiFePO4 and LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathodes demonstrate 150&#8208;cycles lifespan and high energy density of 617&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 2C rate.

         <title>Operando Magnetism on Oxygen Redox Process in Li&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ magnetism measurement is employed to investigate the magnetic/electronic structure evolution in the Li&#8208;rich cathode. The magnetization changes demonstrate that charge storage behavior originates from synergistic transition metal spin&#8208;state variation and &#960;&#8208;to&#8208;&#963; interaction evolution, and further elucidate the internal origin of capacity decay during cycling. The Mn&#9472;O orbital model provides potential criteria for oxygen redox, guiding rational design of anionic redox&#8208;based cathodes.








Abstract
Oxide ions in lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides can store charge at high voltage and offer a viable route toward the higher energy density batteries. However, the underlying oxygen redox mechanism in such materials still remains elusive at present. In this work, a precise in situ magnetism measurement is employed to monitor real&#8208;time magnetization variation associated with unpaired electrons in Li1.2Mn0.6Ni0.2O2 cathode material, enabling the investigation on magnetic/electronic structure evolution in electrochemical cycling. The magnetization gradually decreases except for a weak upturn above 4.6&#160;V during the initial charging process. According to the comprehensive analyses of various in/ex situ characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the magnetization rebound can be attributed to the interaction evolution of lattice oxygen from &#960;&#8208;type delocalized Mn&#9472;O coupling to &#963;&#8208;type O&#9472;O dimerization bonding. Moreover, the magnetization amplitude attenuation after long&#8208;term cycles provides important evidence for the irreversible structure transition and capacity fading. The oxygen redox mechanism concluded by in situ magnetism characterization can be generalized to other electrode materials with an anionic redox process and provide pivotal guidance for designing advanced high&#8208;performance cathode materials.

         <title>Emergent Multiple Spin States From Baromagnetic Effect in Strongly Correlated Magnet Mn&#8323;GaC</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In kagome lattice magnet Mn&#8323;GaC, controllable multiple spin states with giant baro&#8208;magnetoresistance effect, which can enhance magnetic storage, are achieved by manipulating spin rotation within the spin&#8208;polarized plane through applied pressure. These multiple spin states originate from the synergistic mechanism between spin frustration and spin polarization.








Abstract
Strongly correlated magnets, exhibiting distinctive spin properties such as spin&#8208;orbit coupling, spin polarization, and chiral spin, are regarded as the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;density magnetic storage materials in spintronics. Nevertheless, owing to intricate spin interactions, realizing controllable spin arrangement and high&#8208;density magnetic storage remains a formidable challenge. Here, controllable multiple spin states induced by the baromagnetic effect in kagome lattice magnet Mn&#8323;GaC are first reported, achieved by manipulating spin rotation within the spin&#8208;polarized plane employing pressure. Neutron diffraction refinement and specific heat measurements under pressure, combined with first&#8208;principles calculations, demonstrate that multiple spin states are originating from the synergistic mechanism between spin frustration and spin polarization related to the lifting of degeneracy in electronic microstates. Electrical transport measurements under pressure reveal that multiple spin states exhibit giant baro&#8208;magnetoresistance effect, enabling enhanced storage density in spintronics via multi&#8208;logic state applications. Integrating the pressure response and microscopic behaviors of spins, a comprehensive p&#8208;T&#8208;H phase diagram is constructed, offering a novel and robust framework for multi&#8208;logic states. These findings provide critical insights into controllable spin states, opening a new avenue for high&#8208;density magnetic storage through multiple spin states.

         <title>Discovery of a New Cu&#8208;Based Chalcogenide with High zT Near Room Temperature: Low&#8208;Cost Alternative for the Bi2Te3&#8208;Based Thermoelectrics</title>

         <dc:description>
This study reports the discovery of a stable &#947;&#8208;phase in Cu6Te3&#8208;xS1+x, achieving high thermoelectric performance with a Seebeck coefficient up to 200 &#181;VK&#8315;&#185; and ultralow thermal conductivity (&#8776;0.25 Wm&#8315;&#185;K&#8315;&#185;). The material eliminates phase transitions, exhibits a zT of &#8776;1.1 at 500 K, and offers a cost&#8208;effective, eco&#8208;friendly alternative for waste heat recovery and cooling applications.








Abstract
Copper&#8208;based chalcogenides are cost&#8208;effective and environmentally friendly thermoelectric (TE) materials for waste heat recovery. Despite demonstrating excellent thermoelectric performance, binary Cu2X (X&#160;=&#160;S, Se, and Te) chalcogenides undergo superionic phase transitions above room temperature, leading to microstructural evolution and unstable properties. In this work, a new &#947;&#8208;phase of Cu6Te3&#8208;xS1+x (0&#160;&lt;&#160;x &#8804;&#160;1) is discovered, a narrow&#8208;bandgap semiconductor with outstanding thermoelectric performance and high stability. By substituting Te with S in metallic Cu6Te3S, the crystal symmetry is modified and structural phase transitions are eliminated. The &#947;&#8208;phase exhibits a significantly higher Seebeck coefficient of up to 200&#160;&#181;VK&#8722;1 compared to 8.8&#160;&#181;VK&#8722;1 for Cu6Te3S at room temperature due to optimized carrier concentration and increased effective mass. Cu6Te3&#8208;xS1+x materials also demonstrate ultralow thermal conductivity (&#8776;0.25 Wm&#8722;1K&#8722;1), which, in concert with improved power factors, enables a high zT of &#8776;1.1 at a relatively low temperature of 500&#160;K. Unlike most Cu&#8208;based chalcogenides, the &#947;&#8208;phase exhibits excellent transport property stability across multiple thermal cycles, making it a cost&#8208;effective and eco&#8208;friendly alternative to Bi2Te3&#8208;based materials. The developed Cu6Te3&#8208;xS1+x is a promising candidate for thermoelectric converters in waste heat recovery, and its potential can be further extended to cooling applications through carrier concentration tuning.

The material eliminates phase transitions, exhibits a &lt;i&gt;zT&lt;/i&gt; of &#8776;1.1 at 500 K, and offers a cost-effective, eco-friendly alternative for waste heat recovery and cooling applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper-based chalcogenides are cost-effective and environmentally friendly thermoelectric (TE) materials for waste heat recovery. Despite demonstrating excellent thermoelectric performance, binary Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;S, Se, and Te) chalcogenides undergo superionic phase transitions above room temperature, leading to microstructural evolution and unstable properties. In this work, a new &#947;-phase of Cu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3-&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;1+&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; (0&#160;&amp;lt;&#160;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; &#8804;&#160;1) is discovered, a narrow-bandgap semiconductor with outstanding thermoelectric performance and high stability. By substituting Te with S in metallic Cu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S, the crystal symmetry is modified and structural phase transitions are eliminated. The &#947;-phase exhibits a significantly higher Seebeck coefficient of up to 200&#160;&#181;VK&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; compared to 8.8&#160;&#181;VK&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for Cu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S at room temperature due to optimized carrier concentration and increased effective mass. Cu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3-&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;1+&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; materials also demonstrate ultralow thermal conductivity (&#8776;0.25 Wm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), which, in concert with improved power factors, enables a high &lt;i&gt;zT&lt;/i&gt; of &#8776;1.1 at a relatively low temperature of 500&#160;K. Unlike most Cu-based chalcogenides, the &#947;-phase exhibits excellent transport property stability across multiple thermal cycles, making it a cost-effective and eco-friendly alternative to Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based materials. The developed Cu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3-&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;1+&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; is a promising candidate for thermoelectric converters in waste heat recovery, and its potential can be further extended to cooling applications through carrier concentration tuning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phase and Orbital Engineering Effectuating Efficient Adsorption and Catalysis toward High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8722;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The c&#8208;B&#8208;Mo2C catalyst, constructed through a phase and orbital engineering strategy, significantly enhances its catalytic activity by restructuring the basal surface for the conversion of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. Consequently, c&#8208;B&#8208;Mo2C&#8208;based batteries exhibit elevated capacity, excellent rate capability, and stable cycling life.








Abstract
The delicate construction of electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity is a strategic method to enhance the kinetics of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Adjusting the local structure of the catalyst is always crucial for understanding the structure&#8211;activity relationship between atomic structure and catalyst performance. Here, in situ induction of electron&#8208;deficient B enables phase engineering Mo2C, realizing the transition from hexagonal (h&#8208;Mo2C) to cubic phase (c&#8208;B&#8208;Mo2C). Meanwhile, the empty sp3 orbital of B favors the effective bonding with electron&#8208;rich sulfur, creates a more valid orbital engineering available. Relying on the binary engineering via B doping, the adsorption and conversion of polysulfides are promoted. Hence, the c&#8208;B&#8208;Mo2C based cell achieves a low&#8208;capacity degradation of 0.04% with the coulombic efficiency exceeding 99.8% in 1000 cycles. Uniform Li+ transport is consistently achieved at 2 mA cm&#8722;2 for over 600 h. A 6.67Ah&#8208;c&#8208;B&#8208;Mo2C based pouch cell has a high energy density of up to 502.1 Wh kg&#8722;1 (E/S ratio of 2.4 &#181;L mg S&#8722;1), while the pouch cell of 2 Ah exhibits an energy density of 372 Wh kg&#8722;1 more than 100 cycles. This study takes advantage of the combined engineering method to provide a guiding approach for elevating the activity of the electrocatalysts rationally.

         <title>Traversing the Periodic Table through Phase&#8208;Separating Nanoreactors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Centimeter&#8208;scale arrays of single nanoparticles, generated through either Dip Pen Nanolithography or Polymer Pen Lithography, allow for the discovery of novel nanomaterials at an unprecedented scale. The development of phase&#8208;separating hydrophobic nanoreactors bypasses element&#8208;specific chemistry limitations, enabling the synthesis of polyelemental metal and metal oxide nanoparticle megalibraries from at least 52 metal elements with an almost infinite number of chemical combinations in a single experiment.








Abstract
Phase&#8208;separating nanoreactors, generated through either Dip Pen Nanolithography (DPN)&#160;or Polymer Pen Lithography (PPL) and capable of single nanoparticle formation, are compatible with almost every relevant element from the periodic table. This advance overcomes one of the most daunting limitations in high throughput materials discovery, specifically enabling the synthesis of broad swaths of the materials genome. Indeed, the platform is compatible with at least 52 metal elements of interest and almost an infinite number of combinations. In particular, it is discovered that surface&#8208;confined, attoliter&#8208;volume reactors made of polystyrene (PS) mixtures can be preloaded with metal salts spanning all but the alkali metals and subsequently transformed into single&#8208; or multi&#8208;component nanoparticles of well&#8208;defined dimensions. This is done in a three&#8208;step process, which initially involves the facilitation of precursor precipitation and localization with toluene vapor, followed by plasma treatment to remove the polymer reactor component, and then heating from 400&#8211;900&#160;&#176;C, depending upon precursor and desired end&#8208;state (degree of reduction and crystallinity). These phase&#8208;separating nanoreactors are used to produce metal and metal oxide nanoparticles, depending upon conditions, in a substrate&#8208;general manner.

         <title>Chiral Pseudogap Metal Emerging from a Disordered Van der Waals Mott Insulator 1T&#8208;TaS2 &#8722; xSex</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intriguing metal was discovered in a chiral charge density wave material, 1T&#8208;TaS2. The random substitution of S by Se induces a transition from an insulator to a metal with a strongly suppressed electron density at the Fermi energy. The pseudogap comes from electronic disorder on with substantial electron correlation and exhibits unprecedented chirality, which may induce exotic superconductivity. 








Abstract
The emergence of a pseudogap is a hallmark of anomalous electronic states formed through substantial manybody interaction but the mechanism of the pseudogap formation and its role in related emerging quantum states such as unconventional superconductivity remain largely elusive. Here, the emergence of an unusual pseudogap in a representative van der Waals chiral charge density wave (CDW) materials with strong electron correlation, 1T&#8208;TaS2 is reported, through isoelectronic substitute of S. The evolution of electronic band dispersions of 1T&#8208;TaS2 &#8722; xSex (0 &#10877; x &#10877; 2) is systematically investigated using angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The results show that the Se substitution induces a quantum transition from an insulating to a pseudogap metallic phase with the CDW order preserved. Moreover, the asymmetry of the pseudogap spectral function is found, which reflects the chiral nature of CDW structure. The present observation is contrasted with the previous suggestions of a Mott transition driven by band width control or charge transfer. Instead, the pseudogap phase is attributed to a disordered Mott insulator in line with the recent observation of substantial lateral electronic disorder. These findings provide a unique electronic system with chiral pseudogap, where the complex interplay between CDW, chirality, disorder, and electronic correlation may lead to unconventional emergent&#160;physics.

         <title>Orbital Matching Mechanism&#8208;Guided Synthesis of Cu&#8208;Based Single Atom Alloys for Acidic CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple yet intuitive d&#8208;p orbital matching mechanism is proposed for assessing the atomic dispersion stability of Cu&#8208;based single atom alloys (SAAs). This theoretical framework offers electronic orbital insights into stability factors and is universally applicable for designing stable SAAs. The designed SAAs are experimentally demonstrated with enhanced mono&#8208;carbon product selectivity in a prototype reaction&#8212;acidic CO2 electroreduction.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;A simple yet intuitive &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; orbital matching mechanism is proposed for assessing the atomic dispersion stability of Cu-based single atom alloys (SAAs). This theoretical framework offers electronic orbital insights into stability factors and is universally applicable for designing stable SAAs. The designed SAAs are experimentally demonstrated with enhanced mono-carbon product selectivity in a prototype reaction&#8212;acidic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction.

         <title>CNT&#8208;Supported RuNi Composites Enable High Round&#8208;Trip Efficiency in Regenerative Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
RuNi composites are constructed on surface&#8208;functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and demonstrated as a multifunctional electrocatalyst for both alkaline hydrogen and oxygen electrolysis. The exceptional catalytic activity and multifunctionality of the catalyst composites across all key reactions enable a regenerative fuel cell system to achieve high round&#8208;trip efficiency at industrial&#8208;level current densities.








Abstract
Regenerative fuel cells hold significant potential for efficient, large&#8208;scale energy storage by reversibly converting electrical energy into hydrogen and vice versa, making them essential for leveraging intermittent renewable energy sources. However, their practical implementation is hindered by the unsatisfactory efficiency. Addressing this challenge requires the development of cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts. In this study, a carbon nanotube (CNT)&#8208;supported RuNi composite with low Ru loading is developed as an efficient and stable catalyst for alkaline hydrogen and oxygen electrocatalysis, including hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, hydrogen oxidation, and oxygen reduction reaction. Furthermore, a regenerative fuel cell using this catalyst composite is assembled and evaluated under practical relevant conditions. As anticipated, the system exhibits outstanding performance in both the electrolyzer and fuel cell modes. Specifically, it achieves a low cell voltage of 1.64&#160;V to achieve a current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2 for the electrolyzer mode and delivers a high output voltage of 0.52&#160;V at the same current density in fuel cell mode, resulting in a round&#8208;trip efficiency (RTE) of 31.6% without further optimization. The multifunctionality, high activity, and impressive RTE resulted by using the RuNi catalyst composites underscore its potential as a single catalyst for regenerative fuel cells.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Retina by Regulating Ion&#8208;Confined Transport in Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ion&#8208;confined transport strategy is developed to construct a bio&#8208;inspired retina that processes information through synaptic mechanisms, enabling precise modulation of optical signals. By integrating both inhibitory and excitatory artificial synapses, the system effectively processes various vision tasks, including image recognition, dynamic motion analysis, and path planning for robot vehicles.








Abstract
The effective and precise processing of visual information by the human eye primarily relies on the diverse contrasting functions achieved through synaptic regulation of ion transport in the retina. Developing a bio&#8208;inspired retina that uses ions as information carriers can more accurately replicate retina's natural signal processing capabilities, enabling high&#8208;performance machine vision. Herein, an ion&#8208;confined transport strategy is proposed to construct a bio&#8208;inspired retina by developing artificial synapses with inhibitory and excitatory contrasting functions. By fine&#8208;tuning the ionic hydrogel structures to control ion transport across the heterogeneous interfaces, inhibitory and excitatory synapses are realized to negatively or positively modulate the optical signal. The integration of these synapses facilitates advanced tasks such as image recognition and motion analysis. Moreover, as a proof of concept, guiding robot vehicles to perform path planning is demonstrated. This work offers a new idea for constructing the bio&#8208;inspired retina by precisely regulating ion transport, allowing it to reach a level closer to the biological retina.

         <title>Giant Non&#8208;Saturating Exchange Striction in a Noncollinear Antiferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality single crystals of the noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn are synthesized, and a non&#8208;saturating magnetostriction exceeding 400&#160;ppm under 57 T is observed, surpassing the giant magnetostriction materials such as FeGa. The theoretical analyses indicate that this pronounced non&#8208;saturating magnetostriction stems from an exotic exchange striction mechanism, which facilitates a linear relationship between strain output and applied magnetic field.








Abstract
Magnetostriction, discovered by Joule in 1842, refers to the mechanical strain that a material undergoes in the presence of a magnetic field. Conventionally, it originates from the spin&#8208;orbit coupling and has been predominantly explored in ferromagnets. In this work, a giant magnetostriction effect is reported in the high&#8208;quality single crystal of a noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn. Non&#8208;saturating magnetostriction exceeding 400&#160;ppm is obtained, which is even larger than the saturation values of the well&#8208;known Fe&#8208;based giant magnetostriction ferromagnetic materials such as FeGa. Theoretical calculations reveal that the large non&#8208;saturating magnetostriction results from a sophisticated exchange striction effect of the noncollinear antiferromagnetic spin structure, leading to a nearly linear dependence of the strain output on the applied magnetic field. This work provides an unprecedented strategy to design next&#8208;generation magnetoelastic materials with noncollinear compensated spin structures.

         <title>Ultrafast Superradiant Scintillation from Isolated Weakly Confined Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficiency and scintillation velocity are critical for high&#8208;energy and medical physics. These parameters, typically conflicting in conventional scintillators, are simultaneously optimized by exploiting the giant oscillator strength of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, leading to radiatively accelerated (multi)excitonic emission with unity efficiency without detrimental light transport losses in polymeric nanocomposites. This opens up interesting developments in fast&#8208;timing radiation detection based on colloidal nanocrystals.








Abstract
Efficiency and emission rate are two traditionally conflicting parameters in radiation detection, and achieving their simultaneous maximization can significantly advance ultrafast time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (ToF) technologies. In this study, it is demonstrated that this goal is attainable by harnessing the giant oscillator strength (GOS) inherent to weakly confined perovskite nanocrystals, which enables superradiant scintillation under mildly cryogenic conditions that align seamlessly with ToF technologies. It is shown that the radiative acceleration due to GOS encompasses both single and multiple exciton dynamics arising from ionizing interactions, further enhanced by suppressed non&#8208;radiative losses and Auger recombination at 80 K. The outcome is ultrafast scintillation with 420&#160;ps lifetime and light yield of &#8776;10&#160;000 photons/MeV for diluted NC solutions, all without non&#8208;radiative losses. Temperature&#8208;dependent light&#8208;guiding experiments on test&#8208;bed nanocomposite scintillators finally indicate that the light&#8208;transport capability remains unaffected by the accumulation of band&#8208;edge oscillator strength due to GOS. These findings suggest a promising pathway toward developing ultrafast nanotechnological scintillators with optimized light output and timing performance.

         <title>Regulating Electron Distribution in Regioisomeric Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Solar&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>

Two regioisomeric COFs incorporating the thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene moiety are synthesized for photocatalytic H2O2 production. The &#946;&#8208;isomer exhibits exceptional performance compared to the &#945;&#8208;isomeric counterpart due to optimized electron distribution, enhance charge transfer efficiency, and precise alignment of excited&#8208;state electrons with the ORR active site, demonstrating the great potential of leveraging regioisomerism in COF design.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are emerging as a transformative platform for photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production due to their highly ordered structures, intrinsic porosity, and molecular tunability. Despite their potential, the inefficient utilization of photogenerated charge carriers in COFs significantly restrains their photocatalytic efficiency. This study presents two regioisomeric COFs, &#945;&#8208;TT&#8208;TDAN COF and &#946;&#8208;TT&#8208;TDAN COF, both incorporating thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene moieties, to investigate the influence of regioisomerism on the excited electron distribution and its impact on photocatalytic performance. The &#946;&#8208;TT&#8208;TDAN COF demonstrates a remarkable solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 1.35%, outperforming its &#945;&#8208;isomeric counterpart, which is merely 0.44%. Comprehensive spectroscopic and computational investigations reveal the critical role of subtle substitution change in COFs on their electronic properties. This structural adjustment intricately connects molecular structure to charge dynamics, enabling precise regulation of electron distribution, efficient charge separation and transport, and localization of excited electrons at active sites. Moreover, this finely tuned interplay significantly enhances the efficiency of the oxygen reduction reaction. These findings establish a new paradigm in COF design, offering a molecular&#8208;level strategy to advance COFs and reticular materials toward highly efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion.

         <title>In Situ Repair and Reconstruction of Copper Surface Enhanced Its Anti&#8208;Oxidation Properties and Stability for Deep Learning&#8208;Powered Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Labels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ repair and surface reconstruction of oxidized copper (Cu) (Cu foil, Cu nanowires, Cu nanoparticles) is achieved by solvothermal reaction. The experimental data and Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that (111) crystal&#8208;plane reconstruction enhances the oxidation resistance of the metal, and the method is equally applicable to the Ag nanomaterials (Ag nanowires, Ag nanocubes), which also exhibits good oxidation resistance.








Abstract
The in situ repair of oxidized copper (Cu) surfaces while constructing a superior protective layer is critical for sustainable development and the efficient utilization of metallic materials. Here, a simple solvothermal treatment is presented to repair oxidized Cu surfaces (Cu foils, nanowires, and nanocubes) and reconstruct an antioxidant layer with an ordered (111) crystal&#8208;plane (Cu&#8208;SC) in situ. Electrochemical measurements reveal that the corrosion rate of Cu&#8208;SC in 0.1&#160;m NaOH is reduced to 1.99 &#215; 10&#8722;3&#160;mm yr&#8722;&#185;, a fivefold improvement over pristine Cu (1.00 &#215; 10&#8722;2 mm yr&#8722;&#185;). Density functional theory calculations confirm that the reconstructed (111) surface reduces oxygen molecule adsorption, significantly hinders oxygen atom diffusion into the bulk and continuous adsorption on surface. Anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels fabricated from Cu&#8208;SC nanowires exhibit exceptional durability, retaining reliable authentication accuracy after 144&#160;h at 85&#160;&#176;C/85% relative humidity and 2000 bending cycles. The enhanced anti&#8208;oxidation properties of Cu&#8208;SC ensure the stability of its microstructures, which are critical for deep learning&#8208;based authentication, allowing precise feature extraction and accurate label verification even under extreme conditions. These results highlight the potential of (111) surface reconstruction for enhancing material stability, enabling advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications, and promoting the sustainable utilization of metallic materials.

         <title>Suspension Electrolytes with Catalytically Self&#8208;Expediating Desolvation Kinetics for Low&#8208;Temperature Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CeO2&#8208;x&#8208;suspension electrolyte is initially proposed to regulate the Zn[(H2O)6]2+ solvation structure and alters the inner Helmholtz plane to accelerate Zn[(H2O)6]2+ desolvation, achieving a homogenized electric field and uniform ion flux kinetics. Consequently, the suspen sion electrolyte achieves a service life exceeding 6500 h at 0&#160;&#176;C and demonstrates outstanding rate performance at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, highlighting its practical potential for AZMBs.








Abstract
The conventional electrolyte for rechargeable aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs) breeds many problems such as Zn dendrite growth and side reaction of hydrogen evolution reaction, which are fundamentally attributed to the uneven ion flux owing to the high barriers of desolvation and diffusion of Zn[(H2O)6]2+ clusters. Herein, to modulate the [Zn(H2O)6]2+ solvation structure, the suspension electrolyte engineering employed with electron&#8208;delocalized catalytic nanoparticles is initially proposed to expedite desolvation kinetics. As a proof, the electron&#8208;density&#8208;adjustable CeO2&#8208;x is introduced into the commercial electrolyte and preferentially adsorbed on the Zn surface, regulating the Zn[(H2O)6]2+ structure. Meanwhile, the defect&#8208;rich CeO2&#8208;x redistributes the localized space electric field to uniformize ion flux kinetics and inhibits dendrite growth, as confirmed by a series of theoretical simulations, spectroscopical and experimental measurements. Encouragingly, the CeO2&#8208;x decorated suspension electrolyte enables a long stability over 1200 cycles at 5 mA cm&#8722;2 and an extended lifespan exceeding 6500 h with lower overpotentials of 34 mV under 0&#160;&#176;C. Matched with polyaniline cathodes, the full cells with suspension electrolyte exhibit a capacity&#8208;retention of 96.75% at 1 A g&#8722;1 under &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C as well as a long lifespan of up to 400 cycles in a large&#8208;areal pouch cell, showcasing promising potentials of suspension electrolyte for practical AZMBs.

         <title>Synergetic Oxidized Mg and Mo Sites on Amorphous Ru Metallene Boost Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sluggish water&#8208;splitting step hinders the advancement of alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), making the design of efficient water&#8208;splitting active sites critical. The MgOx and MoOy on the atomically thin Ru metallene can cooperatively promote the adsorption&#8211;dissociation of water molecules, greatly promoting the efficiency of alkaline HER.








Abstract
Ruthenium (Ru) is considered as a promising catalyst for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), yet its weak water adsorption ability hinders the water splitting efficiency. Herein, a concept of introducing the oxygenophilic MgOx and MoOy species onto amorphous Ru metallene is demonstrated through a simple one&#8208;pot salt&#8208;templating method for the synergic promotion of water adsorption and splitting to greatly enhance the alkaline HER electrocatalysis. The atomically thin MgOx and MoOy species on Ru metallene (MgOx/MoOy&#8208;Ru) show a 15.3&#8208;fold increase in mass activity for HER at the potential of 100&#160;mV than that of Ru metallene and an ultralow overpotential of 8.5&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. It is further demonstrated that the MgOx/MoOy&#8208;Ru&#8208;based anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer can achieve a high current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a remarkably low cell voltage of 1.55&#160;V, and exhibit excellent durability of over 60&#160;h at a current density of 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical simulations reveal that the co&#8208;introduction of MgOx and MoOy enhances interfacial water adsorption and splitting by promoting adsorption on oxidized Mg sites and lowering the dissociation&#160;energy barrier on oxidized Mo sites.

&lt;p&gt;Ruthenium (Ru) is considered as a promising catalyst for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), &lt;i&gt;yet&lt;/i&gt; its weak water adsorption ability hinders the water splitting efficiency. Herein, a concept of introducing the oxygenophilic MgO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; and MoO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; species onto amorphous Ru metallene is demonstrated through a simple one-pot salt-templating method for the synergic promotion of water adsorption and splitting to greatly enhance the alkaline HER electrocatalysis. The atomically thin MgO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; and MoO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; species on Ru metallene (MgO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/MoO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-Ru) show a 15.3-fold increase in mass activity for HER at the potential of 100&#160;mV than that of Ru metallene and an ultralow overpotential of 8.5&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. It is further demonstrated that the MgO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/MoO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-Ru-based anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer can achieve a high current density of 100&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at a remarkably low cell voltage of 1.55&#160;V, and exhibit excellent durability of over 60&#160;h at a current density of 500&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical simulations reveal that the co-introduction of MgO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; and MoO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; enhances interfacial water adsorption and splitting by promoting adsorption on oxidized Mg sites and lowering the dissociation&#160;energy barrier on oxidized Mo sites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlled Modulation of Intrinsic Electron Response in C/CoxTy Nanoplates Toward Multispectral Excitation Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the C/CoxTy nanoplates with high&#8208;efficiency and tunable electromagnetic properties are successfully prepared by customizing Co&#8208;based nanoparticles. Relying on these C/CoxTy nanoplates, a series of multispectral electromagnetic functional devices are developed, opening up a new era of multispectral electromagnetic devices.








Abstract
Electromagnetic materials with adjustable dielectric and magnetic properties are constantly sought after in electronic and industrial fields. In this study, an innovative strategy that customizes anchored Co&#8208;based nanoparticles to optimize the electronic behaviors is proposed for the first time, enabling a controllable and high&#8208;efficiency evolution of the macroscopic electromagnetic response of Co&#8208;based (C/CoxTy) nanoplates across the X&#8208;ray, light in the solar band and gigahertz band. Specifically, in the gigahertz band, the C/Co and C/Co3Se4 nanoplates with high&#8208;power loss capabilities can effectively attenuate and convert electromagnetic energy into heat energy, which not only prevents space electromagnetic radiation but also powers energy for various electromagnetic devices such as thermoelectric generators and microwave actuators. Moreover, multiband antennas and ultra&#8208;wideband bandstop filters are successfully achieved and flexibly tuned. Meanwhile, C/CoxTy nanoplates photo&#8208; and X&#8208;ray detectors are constructed successfully. Additionally, the C/CoTe nanoplate X&#8208;ray detector, featuring remarkable stability, sensitivity and penetrability, is successfully utilized to construct the interaction system integrating communication and imaging. In summary, this work offers an effective way for flexible regulation of multispectral electromagnetic response, significantly advancing the development of multispectral electromagnetic functional devices.

         <title>Non&#8208;Invasive Diagnosis of Early Colorectal Cancerization via Amplified Sensing of MicroRNA&#8208;21 in NIR&#8208;II Window</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amplified sensing strategy is reported in the second near&#8208;infrared long&#8208;wavelength (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L, 1500&#8211;1900 nm) window for non&#8208;invasivel in situ visualization of early cancerization biomarker miRNA&#8208;21, providing a promising alternative for early diagnosis of cancerization and a guidance for therapeutic management.








Abstract
Accurate, sensitive, and in situ visualization of aberrant expression level of low&#8208;abundant biomolecules is crucial for early colorectal cancer (CRC) detection ahead of tumor morphology change. However, the clinical used colonoscopy and biopsy methods are invasive and lack of sensitivity at early&#8208;stage of cancerization. Here, an amplified sensing strategy is developed in the second near&#8208;infrared long&#8208;wavelength subregion (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L, 1500&#8211;1900&#160;nm) by integrating DNAzyme&#8208;triggered signal amplification technology and lanthanide&#8208;dye hybrid system. In the early&#8208;stage of CRC, the overexpressed biomarker microRNA&#8208;21 initiates the NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L luminescence ratiometric signal amplification of the CRCsensor. The high sensitivity with a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.26 pm allows non&#8208;invasive visualization of orthotopic colorectal cancerization via rectal administration, which achieves early and accurate in situ diagnosis at 2 weeks ahead of the in vitro histological results. This innovative approach offers a promising tool for early diagnosis and long&#8208;term monitoring of carcinogenesis progression, with potential applications in other cancer&#8208;related biomarkers.

         <title>Residual Al Adatoms Driven Epitaxy of AlGaN QWs for High&#8208;Performance UV LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative strategy is proposed for the atomic&#8208;level controllable growth of composition&#8208;engineered AlGaN quantum wells (QWs) with residual Al adatom&#8208;assisted incorporation&#8208;enhanced epitaxy (RAIE) strategy, enabling the achievement of high&#8208;efficiency and long&#8208;lifetime ultraviolet light&#8208;emitting diodes (UV LEDs) with tunable wavelengths spanning the efficiency gap region from 276 to 329&#160;nm in the UV band.








Abstract
AlGaN&#8208;based ultraviolet (UV) light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) experience a notable reduction in efficiency within the 280&#8211;330&#160;nm wavelength range, known as the &#8220;UVB gap&#8221;. Given the extensive applications of UV LEDs in this wavelength range, it is imperative to bridge this efficiency gap. In this study, a strategy facilitated by the presence of residual Al adatoms is introduced to simultaneously improve the integration of Ga&#8208;adatoms and the migration of Al/Ga&#8208;adatoms during the growth of low&#8208;Al&#8208;composition AlGaN quantum wells (QWs) even at high temperatures comparable to those used for high&#8208;Al&#8208;composition AlGaN quantum barriers. This growth strategy enables the epitaxy of high&#8208;quality AlGaN QWs with a wide tunable emission wavelength range across the UVB gap. Utilizing this approach, high&#8208;efficiency UV LEDs that effectively bridge the UVB gap are developed. Furthermore, benefiting from this QWs growth configuration, these UV LEDs exhibit an exceptionally long L70 lifetime, marking a significant step forward in the growth technology of AlGaN QWs and expanding the application possibilities of UV LEDs.

         <title>Engineering High&#8208;Density Grain Boundaries in Ru0.8Ir0.2Ox Solid&#8208;Solution Nanosheets for Efficient and Durable OER Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategically engineered Ru0.8Ir0.2Ox ultrathin nanosheets with high&#8208;density grain boundaries exhibit enhanced oxygen evolution reaction performance in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. This design optimizes Ru&#8208;Ir interactions and charge distribution, reducing overpotential to 189 mV for 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and maintaining stability for &gt;1000 h at industrial&#8208;scale current density. This advancement offers a pathway to efficient, cost&#8208;effective green hydrogen production.








Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE) has long stood as a formidable challenge for green hydrogen sustainable production, hindered by sluggish kinetics, high overpotentials, and poor durability. Here, these barriers are transcended through a novel material design: strategic engineering of high&#8208;density grain boundaries within solid&#8208;solution Ru0.8Ir0.2Ox ultrathin nanosheets. These carefully tailored grain boundaries and synergistic Ir&#9472;Ru interactions, reduce the coordination of Ru atoms and optimize the distribution of charge, thereby enhancing both the catalytic activity and stability of the nanosheets, as verified by merely requiring an overpotential of 189 mV to achieve 10 mA cm&#8722;2 in acidic electrolyte. In situ electrochemical techniques, complemented by theoretical calculations, reveal that the OER follows an adsorption evolution mechanism, demonstrating the pivotal role of grain boundary engineering and electronic modulation in accelerating reaction kinetics. Most notably, the Ru0.8Ir0.2Ox exhibits outstanding industrial&#8208;scale performance in PEMWE, reaching 4.0 A cm&#8722;2 at 2 V and maintaining stability for &gt;1000 h at 500 mA cm&#8722;2. This efficiency reduces hydrogen production costs to $0.88 kg&#8722;1. This work marks a transformative step forward in designing efficient, durable OER catalysts, offering a promising pathway toward hydrogen production technologies and advancing the global transition to sustainable energy.

&lt;p&gt;The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE) has long stood as a formidable challenge for green hydrogen sustainable production, hindered by sluggish kinetics, high overpotentials, and poor durability. Here, these barriers are transcended through a novel material design: strategic engineering of high-density grain boundaries within solid-solution Ru&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Ir&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; ultrathin nanosheets. These carefully tailored grain boundaries and synergistic Ir&#9472;Ru interactions, reduce the coordination of Ru atoms and optimize the distribution of charge, thereby enhancing both the catalytic activity and stability of the nanosheets, as verified by merely requiring an overpotential of 189 mV to achieve 10 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in acidic electrolyte. In situ electrochemical techniques, complemented by theoretical calculations, reveal that the OER follows an adsorption evolution mechanism, demonstrating the pivotal role of grain boundary engineering and electronic modulation in accelerating reaction kinetics. Most notably, the Ru&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Ir&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits outstanding industrial-scale performance in PEMWE, reaching 4.0 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 2 V and maintaining stability for &amp;gt;1000 h at 500 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This efficiency reduces hydrogen production costs to $0.88 kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This work marks a transformative step forward in designing efficient, durable OER catalysts, offering a promising pathway toward hydrogen production technologies and advancing the global transition to sustainable energy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An n&#8208;Doped Organic Cross&#8208;Linked Electron Transport Layer with High Electrical Conductivity for High&#8208;Efficiency Tandem Organic Photovoltaics</title>

An n&#8208;doped ETL, that is c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI with high electrical conductivity, strong work function modification ability and good solvent resistance, is developed via a simple in situ cross&#8208;linking reaction. The tandem OPVs, with the all&#8208;solution&#8208;processed organic/organic ICL (m&#8208;PEDOT:PSS/c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI) achieve 20.06% efficiency under solar radiation, and 38.50% efficiency under 808 nm laser. This study provides a new method to design high&#8208;perfoimance ICLs.








Abstract
With merits of good solution processability, intrinsic flexibility, etc, organic/organic interconnecting layers (ICLs) are highly desirable for tandem organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Herein, an n&#8208;doped cross&#8208;linked organic electron transport layer (ETL), named c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI is developed, via a simple in situ quaternization reaction between bromopentyl&#8208;substituted naphthalene diimide derivative (NDI&#8208;Br) and polyethylenimine (PEI). Due to strong self&#8208;doping, c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI films exhibit a high electrical conductivity (0.06 S&#160;cm&#8722;1), which is important for efficient hole and electron reombination in ICL of tandem OPVs. In addition, the cross&#8208;linked ETLs show strong work function modulation ability, and good solvent&#8208;resistance. The above features enable c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI to function as an efficient ETL not only for single&#8208;junction OPVs, but also for tandem devices without any metal layer in ICL. Under solar radiation, the single&#8208;junction device with c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI as ETL achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.18%, surpassing the ZnO&#8208;based device (17.09%). The homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;tandem devices with m&#8208;PEDOT:PSS:c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI as ICL exhibit remarkable PCEs of 19.06% and 20.06%, respectively. Under 808&#160;nm laser radiation with a photon flux of 57&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, the homo&#8208;tandem device presents a superior PCE of 38.5%. This study provides a new ETL for constructing all&#8208;solution&#8208;processed organic/organic ICL, which can be integrated in flexible and wearable devices.

         <title>An Air&#8208;Operated, High&#8208;Performance Fe&#8208;Ion Secondary Battery Using Acidic Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The air&#8208;operated assembly of aqueous Fe&#8208;ion batteries is realized by a very unexpected finding when excess acid is introduced into the traditional aqueous FeSO4 electrolyte. A proton/O2 competitive mechanism for the as&#8208;detected ultra&#8208;low dissolved O2 and reduced coordinated O2 in the Fe2+ solvated shell is revealed.








Abstract
Fe2+ have emerged as the ideal charge carriers to construct aqueous batteries as one of the most competitive candidates for next&#8208;generation low&#8208;cost and safe energy storage. Unfortunately, the fast oxidation of Fe2+ into Fe3+ at ambient conditions inevitably requires the assembly process of the cells in an oxygen&#8208;free glovebox. Up to date, direct air assembly of aqueous Fe&#8208;ion battery remains very desirable yet highly challenge. Here oxidation of Fe2+ is found at ambient condition and is completely inhibited in an acidic electrolyte. A proton/O2 competitive mechanism in the acidic electrolyte is revealed with reduced coordinated O2 in the Fe2+ solvated shell for this unexpected finding. Based on this surprise, for the first time, air&#8208;operated assembly of iron&#8208;ion batteries is realized. Meanwhile, it is found that the acidic environment induces the in situ growth of active &#945;&#8208;FeOOH derivate on the VOPO4&#183;2H2O surface. Strikingly, the acidic electrolyte enables an air&#8208;operated Fe&#8208;ion battery with a high specific capacity of 192 mAh g&#8722;1 and ultrastable cycling stability over 1300 cycles at 0.1 A g&#8722;1. This work makes a break through on the air&#8208;assembly of Fe&#8208;ion battery without oxygen&#8208;free glovebox. It also reveals previously unknown proton/O2 competitive mechanisms in the Fe2+ solvated shell and cathode surface chemistry for aqueous Fe2+ storage.

         <title>Grains &gt; 2&#160;&#181;m with Regulating Grain Boundaries for Efficient Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite and All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A simple and effective approach to grain boundary growth optimization: Incorporating a KTFB polyfluorinated additive into the antisolvent to regulate grain boundary growth, eliminate excessive halide lead and defects, and form wide&#8208;bandgap (1.78&#160;eV) perovskite films with grain size over 2&#160;&#181;m, enabling the realization of efficient two&#8208;terminal and four&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem devices.









Abstract
Tandem perovskite solar cells represent a significant avenue for the future development of perovskite photovoltaics. Despite their promise, wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites, essential for constructing efficient tandem structures, have encountered formidable challenges. Notably, the high bromine content (&gt;40%) in these 1.78 eV bandgap perovskites triggers rapid crystallization, complicating the control of grain boundary growth and leading to films with smaller grain sizes and higher defect density than those with narrower bandgaps. To address this, potassium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate molecules are incorporated into the antisolvent, employing a crystallographic orientation&#8208;tailored strategy to optimize grain boundary growth, thereby achieving wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite films with grains exceeding 2&#160;&#181;m and effectively eliminating surplus lead halide and defects at the grain boundaries. As a result, remarkable efficiency is achieved in single&#8208;junction wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite devices, with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.7%, and in all&#8208;perovskite tandem devices, with a two&#8208;terminal PCE of 28.3% and a four&#8208;terminal PCE of 29.1%, which all rank among the highest reported values in the literature. Moreover, the stability of these devices has been markedly improved. These findings offer a novel perspective for driving further advancements in the perovskite solar cell domain.

         <title>Tailoring Self&#8208;Catalytic N&#9472;Co Bonds into Heterostructure Architectures: Deciphering Polytellurides Conversion Mechanism Toward Ultralong&#8208;Lifespan Potassium Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;doped CoTe2 composites, incorporating 3D low&#8208;tortuosity tunneling structure, self&#8208;catalytic N&#9472;Co bonds, and heterojunction, have been successfully fabricated to accelerate the catalytic conversion of potassium polytellurides. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of unique architecture and superior conversion kinetics, the composites deliver an ultralong&#8208;lifespan potassium storage performance over 25&#160;000 cycles with an ultra&#8208;low capacity decay rate of only 0.0019%.








Abstract
Transition metal tellurides (TMTes) are promising anodes for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) due to their high theoretical specific capacity and impressive electronic conductivity. Nevertheless, TMTes suffer from persistent capacity degradation due to the large volume expansion, high ion&#8208;diffusion energy barriers, and the dissolution/shuttle of potassium polytellurides (KxTey). Herein, a heterostructured CoTe2 composite equipped with a self&#8208;catalytic center (N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC) is developed, exploiting its low&#8208;tortuosity tunneling, chemical tunability, and self&#8208;catalytic properties to elevate cycling stability to new heights. Systematic experiments have verified that the elaborate N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC provides a short&#8208;range and efficient electron/ion transport path, accelerates K+ diffusion kinetics, and suppresses huge volume distortion. Notably, the N&#9472;Co bonds self&#8208;catalytic center can promote the adsorption capabilities and accelerate the conversion kinetics for KxTey under the synergistic effect of heterojunction. Consequently, the optimized N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC electrode delivers an ultralong&#8209;lifespan cyclability (over 25 000 cycles at 2.0 A g&#8722;1, only 0.0019% capacity decay rate per cycle), outperforming those of reported Te&#8208;based anodes. Finally, the N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC//PTCDA@450 full cell manifests impressive stability (over 4300 cycles at 2.0 A g&#8722;1). This work uncovers the impact of catalytic centers on the conversion of KxTey and provides valuable insights for rationally designing ultralong&#8208;lifespan TMTes anodes for PIBs.

&lt;p&gt;N-doped CoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; composites, incorporating 3D low-tortuosity tunneling structure, self-catalytic N&#9472;Co bonds, and heterojunction, have been successfully fabricated to accelerate the catalytic conversion of potassium polytellurides. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of unique architecture and superior conversion kinetics, the composites deliver an ultralong-lifespan potassium storage performance over 25&#160;000 cycles with an ultra-low capacity decay rate of only 0.0019%.

This work proposed an efficient Yb3+&#8208;doped PEA2Cs2Pb3Br10 quasi 2D layered metal halide perovskites (2D&#8208;LMHPs)&#160;film and revealed the microscopic energy transfer process of the complex system. Moreover, an efficient and super&#8208;stable 990 nm NIR PeLED with the external quantum efficiency (EQE)&#160;up to 8.8% and a record operational lifetime of 1274 min is obtained. These findings will expand the optical properties and application potential of quasi 2D&#8208;LMHPs materials.








Abstract
Quasi 2D layered metal halide perovskites (2D&#8208;LMHPs) with natural quantum wells (QWs) structure have garnered significant attention due to their excellent optoelectronic properties. Doping rare earth (RE) ions with 4fn inner shell emission levels can largely expand their optical and optoelectronic properties and realize diverse applications, but has not been reported yet. Herein, an efficient Yb3+&#8208;doped PEA2Cs2Pb3Br10 quasi 2D&#8208;LMHPs is fabricated and directly identified the Yb3+ ions in the quasi 2D&#8208;LMHPs at the atomic scale using aberration electron microscopy. The interaction between different n phases and Yb3+ ions is elucidated using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy and luminescent dynamics, which demonstrated efficient, different time scales and multi&#8208;channel energy transfer processes. Finally, through phase distribution manipulation and surface passivation, the optimized film exhibits a photoluminescence quantum yield of 144%. This is the first demonstration of quantum cutting emission in pure Br&#8208;based perovskite material, suppressing defect states and ion migration. The efficient and stable near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;emitting diodes (NIR LED) is fabricated with a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.8% at 990&#160;nm and the record lifetime of 1274&#160;min. This work provides fresh insight into the interaction between RE ions and quasi 2D&#8208;LMHPs and extend the function and application of quasi 2D&#8208;LMHPs materials.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Assisted Ni 3d&#8211;S 3p Hybridization within Targeted In&#8211;S Layer for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic layer modulation is instrumental in optimizing catalytic kinetics for obtaining highly active photocatalysts. A precise atomic layer regulation strategy is proposed to realize the individual modulation of the surface In&#8211;S layer in ZnIn2S4, which creates deeper hybridized electronic states of Ni 3d&#8211;S 3p to optimize H* adsorption/desorption and maximize surface catalytic benefits for the hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven hydrogen production is significant for achieving carbon neutrality but is limited by unsatisfactory surface catalytic reaction kinetics. Layer regulation can impact carrier transmission or catalytic behavior, but the specific effects on the oxygen or hydrogen evolution reaction (OER or HER) remain unclear, and atomic layer level modulation for maxing HER is challenging. Here the distinct roles of modulated Zn&#8211;S or In&#8211;S surface layers in ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) for the OER and HER, respectively, are disentangled. Moreover, the extensive characterizations and computational results demonstrate that stressful environments enable individual modulation and introduce Ni into the surface In&#8211;S layer rather than the easily alterable Zn&#8211;S layer, creating deeper hybridized electronic states of Ni 3d&#8211;S 3p, optimizing H* adsorption/desorption, and maximizing surface catalytic benefits for the HER. Consequently, the optimized ZIS exhibited a photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of up to 18.19&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, &#8776;32 times higher than pristine ZIS. This investigation expands the application scenarios of ultrasonic technology and inspires other precise control types, such as defects and crystal plane engineering, etc.

Flexible bioelectronic interfaces with adhesive properties are essential for advancing modern medicine and human&#8208;machine interactions.

Abstract
Flexible bioelectronic interfaces with adhesive properties are essential for advancing modern medicine and human&#8208;machine interactions. However, achieving both stable adhesion and non&#8208;damaging detachment remains a significant challenge. In this study, a lithium bond&#8208;mediated molecular cascade hydrogel (LMCH) for bioelectronic interfaces is designed, which facilitates robust adhesion at the tissue level and permits atraumatic detachment for repositioning as required. By integrating the adhesive properties of the molecular cascade structure with the elastic characteristics of the hydrogel interface, the LMCH interface not only achieved a high adhesion strength (197&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2) on the skin, but also significantly extended the cracking cycles on the tissue surface during the peeling process from 4 to 380, marking an enhancement of nearly two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, with Young's modulus similar to that of human tissue (25&#160;kPa), exceptional stretchability (1080%), and high ionic conductivity (7.14&#160;S&#160;m&#8722;1), the LMCH interface demonstrates outstanding tissue compatibility, biocompatibility, and stable detection capabilities for electrocardiogram (ECG) and electromyogram (EMG) signals. This study presents new insights and potential for advancing bioelectronics and implantable interface technologies.

The peptide&#8208;oligonucleotide (PON) nanohybrids can be readily fabricated by the bioorthogonal click reaction between PEG5&#8208;P7&#8208;R9&#8208;(G&#8208;DOPA)4&#8208;HPGGPQ&#8208;H8&#8208;C&#8208;DBCO and miRNA&#8208;124&#8208;A5&#8208;(CH2)6&#8208;Azido, which achieve targeted delivery to the lesion sites, robust penetration through cell membrane, efficient scavenging of intracellular ROS, as well as timely escape from the endolysosomes of macrophages, inhibiting proinflammatory M1 polarization and osteoclast differentiation, eventually attenuating arthritic bone destruction and systemic osteoporosis.









Abstract
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by excessive inflammation, pathological bone resorption, and systemic osteoporosis. It lacks effective treatment due to the complex pathogenesis. Gene therapy, especially targeted oligonucleotide (ON) delivery therapy, offers a new prospect for the precise treatment of RA. Nevertheless, the clinical application of ON delivery therapy still faces various challenges such as the rapid enzymolysis by RNAse, the lack of tissue targeting ability, difficulty in cell membrane penetration, and the incapability of endolysosomal escape. To address these issues, a novel kind of engineered peptide and oligonucleotide (PON) nanohybrids are designed and fabricated, which provide various advantages including good biosafety, inflammatory region&#8208;targeted delivery, cell membrane penetration, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, and endolysosomal escape. The PON nanohybrids produce promising effects in suppressing inflammatory responses and osteoclastogenesis of macrophages via multiple signaling pathways. In vivo administration of PON nanohybrids not only ameliorates local joint bone destruction and systemic osteoporosis in the pathological state, but also demonstrates good prophylactic effects against the rapid progression of RA disease. In conclusion, the study presents a promising strategy for precise RA treatment and broadens the biomedical applications of gene therapy based on delivery system.

         <title>Resolving Dynamic Behavior of Electrocatalysts via Advances of Operando X&#8208;Ray Absorption Spectroscopies: Potential Artifacts and Practical Guidelines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resolving dynamically fine structure of electrocatalysts is realized by advanced X&#8208;ray spectroscopies. Based on a case study of operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy at various beamlines, potential artifacts generated by X&#8208;ray irradiation are validated and it is identified whether the dynamic behaviors are electrochemical reaction related. A practical protocol is proposed for conducting reliable&#160;X&#8208;ray spectroscopic measurements for accurate spectra interpretation.








Abstract
Although numerous techniques are developed to enable real&#8208;time understanding of dynamic interactions at the solid&#8211;liquid interface during electrochemical reactions, further progress in the development of these methods over the last several decades has faced challenges. With the rapid development of high&#8208;brilliance synchrotron sources, operando X&#8208;ray spectroscopies have become increasingly popular for revealing interfacial features and catalytic mechanisms in electrocatalysis. Nevertheless, the resulting spectra are highly sensitive to factors such as X&#8208;ray radiation, reaction environment, and acquisition procedures, all of which may potentially introduce artifacts that are often overlooked, leading to misinterpretations of electrocatalytic behaviors. In this perspective, several emerging hard X&#8208;ray spectroscopies used in electrocatalysis research are reviewed, highlighting their electronic transition processes, detection modes, and functional complementarity. Significantly, based on a case study of operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy at various beamlines, potential artifacts generated by X&#8208;ray irradiation are systematically investigated through photon&#8208;flux density&#8208;, dose&#8208;, and time&#8208;dependent studies of typical copper electrocatalysts. Accordingly, a practical protocol for conducting reliable X&#8208;ray spectroscopic measurements in operando electrocatalytic studies to minimize potential artifacts that can affect the resulting X&#8208;ray spectra, thereby ensuring accurate interpretation and a deeper understanding of interfacial interactions and electrocatalytic mechanisms, is established.
