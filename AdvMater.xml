         <title>Long&#8208;Persistent Luminescence from an Exciplex&#8208;Based Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In an ordinal exciplex&#8208;based organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED), injected holes and electrons immediately recombine to emit light. Meanwhile, an organic long&#8208;persistent luminescent (OLPL) system can store holes and electrons for a long time and exhibit luminescence by recombination. By optimizing the light&#8208;emitting layer of the exciplex&#8208;based OLED, OLPL from an OLED is achieved.








Abstract
Organic long&#8208;persistent luminescent systems (OLPLs) exhibiting long&#8208;lasting emission after photoexcitation consist of organic electron donors and acceptors, that are widely used in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Although OLPLs and OLEDs include very similar excitonic processes, long&#8208;lasting emission has never been observed in OLEDs. This study confirms the presence of long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) under electrical excitation.

         <title>mRNA Delivery of a Bispecific Single&#8208;Domain Antibody to Polarize Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages and Synergize Immunotherapy against Liver Malignancies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative single&#8208;domain antibody that bispecifically binds and neutralizes CCL2 and CCL5 (BisCCL2/5i) is evolved using yeast surface display. mRNAs encoding BisCCL2/5i or a PD&#8208;1 ligand inhibitor (PD&#8208;Li) are encapsulated and delivered via clinically amenable lipid nanoparticles. Combination of BisCCL2/5i with PD&#8208;Li achieves long&#8208;term survival in mouse models of primary liver cancer and liver metastasis of colorectal and pancreatic cancers.








Abstract
Liver malignancies are among the tumor types that are resistant to immune checkpoint inhibition therapy. Tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) are highly enriched and play a major role in inducing immunosuppression in liver malignancies. Herein, CCL2 and CCL5 are screened as two major chemokines responsible for attracting TAM infiltration and inducing their polarization toward cancer&#8208;promoting M2&#8208;phenotype. To reverse this immunosuppressive process, an innovative single&#8208;domain antibody that bispecifically binds and neutralizes CCL2 and CCL5 (BisCCL2/5i) with high potency and specificity is directly evolved. mRNA encoding BisCCL2/5i is encapsulated in a clinically approved lipid nanoparticle platform, resulting in a liver&#8208;homing biomaterial that allows transient yet efficient expression of BisCCL2/5i in the diseased organ in a multiple dosage manner. This BisCCL2/5i mRNA nanoplatform significantly induces the polarization of TAMs toward the antitumoral M1 phenotype and reduces immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. The combination of BisCCL2/5i with PD&#8208;1 ligand inhibitor (PD&#8208;Li) achieves long&#8208;term survival in mouse models of primary liver cancer and liver metastasis of colorectal and pancreatic cancers. The work provides an effective bispecific targeting strategy that could broaden the PD&#8208;Li therapy to multiple types of malignancies in the human liver.

         <title>Large Fermi&#8208;Energy Shift and Suppression of Trivial Surface States in NbP Weyl Semimetal Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological materials host both topological (TP) and trivial (TR) surface states in their band structure, the latter being undesired for topology&#8208;driven applications. A full suppression of trivial surface states is achieved by surface reconstruction of epitaxial NbP Weyl semimetal thin films. Moreover, large shifts of the chemical potential are induced by doping, enabling Fermi&#8208;level engineering of purely topological states.








Abstract
Weyl semimetals, a class of 3D topological materials, exhibit a unique electronic structure featuring linear band crossings and disjoint surface states (Fermi&#8208;arcs). While first demonstrations of topologically driven phenomena have been realized in bulk crystals, efficient routes to control the electronic structure have remained largely unexplored. Here, a dramatic modification of the electronic structure in epitaxially grown NbP Weyl semimetal thin films is reported, using in situ surface engineering and chemical doping strategies that do not alter the NbP lattice structure and symmetry, retaining its topological nature. Through the preparation of a dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free, P&#8208;terminated surface which manifests in a surface reconstruction, all the well&#8208;known trivial surface states of NbP are fully suppressed, resulting in a purely topological Fermi&#8208;arc dispersion. In addition, a substantial Fermi&#8208;energy shift from &#8722;0.2&#160;to 0.3 eV&#160;across the Weyl points is achieved by&#160;surface&#160;chemical doping, unlocking access to the hitherto unexplored n&#8208;type region of the Weyl spectrum. These findings constitute a milestone toward surface&#8208;state and Fermi&#8208;level engineering of topological bands in Weyl semimetals, and, while&#160;there are still challenges in minimizing doping&#8208;driven disorder and grain boundary density in the films,&#160;they do represent a major advance to realize device heterostructures based on Weyl physics.

         <title>2D Honeycomb&#8208;Kagome Polymer Tandem as Effective Metal&#8208;Free Photocatalysts for Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tandem cells made of n&#8208; and p&#8208;type 2D&#8208;HT&#8208;polymers can be used for effective overall water splitting. Upon irradiation, the photon&#8208;generated holes and electrons of low mobility remain in the half&#8208;electrodes and provide sufficient drive potential to promote hydrogen and oxygen evolution. Mobile charges powered by the potential difference will enter the other half&#8208;electrode, resulting in effective electron/hole separation.








Abstract
On the basis of first&#8208;principles calculations, the potential of applying 2D honeycomb&#8208;kagome polymers made of heteroatom&#8208;centered triangulene derivatives to photocatalyze water splitting is explored. The designed 2D polymers possess indirect bandgaps in the range of 1.80&#8211;2.84&#160;eV and show pronounced light absorption in the ultraviolet and visible region of the solar spectrum. With suitable band edge alignment, the examined N&#8208; and B&#8208;center polymers can generate sufficient photon&#8208;excited electrons and holes to activate the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, respectively. The combination of lattice&#8208;inherent band features (flat bands) with chemical functionalization (potential shift due to heteroatoms) makes it possible to construct tandem cells with suppressed electron/hole recombination for effective overall water splitting. In addition, there is a potential difference between the half&#8208;electrodes that can be utlized to power&#8203; auxiliary components in self&#8208;sufficient photocatalyzers.

         <title>Interfacial Covalent Bonds Regulated Electron&#8208;Deficient 2D Black Phosphorus for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A black&#8208;phosphorus&#8208;based metal&#8208;free bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst is developed by covalently bonding black phosphorus with graphitic carbon nitride. The interfacial P&#63743;N covalent bonds in the hybrid catalyst are highlighted to efficiently regulate the electron transfer from black phosphorus to graphitic carbon nitride and significantly promote the OOH* adsorption on phosphorus atoms.








Abstract
Developing resource&#8208;abundant and sustainable metal&#8208;free bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts is essential for the practical application of zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs). 2D black phosphorus (BP) with fully exposed atoms and active lone pair electrons can be promising for oxygen electrocatalysts, which, however, suffers from low catalytic activity and poor electrochemical stability. Herein, guided by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, an efficient metal&#8208;free electrocatalyst is demonstrated via covalently bonding BP nanosheets with graphitic carbon nitride (denoted BP&#8208;CN&#8208;c). The polarized P&#63743;N covalent bonds in BP&#8208;CN&#8208;c can efficiently regulate the electron transfer from BP to graphitic carbon nitride and significantly promote the OOH* adsorption on phosphorus atoms.

&lt;p&gt;A black&#8208;phosphorus&#8208;based metal&#8208;free bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst is developed by covalently bonding black phosphorus with graphitic carbon nitride. The interfacial P&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N covalent bonds in the hybrid catalyst are highlighted to efficiently regulate the electron transfer from black phosphorus to graphitic carbon nitride and significantly promote the OOH* adsorption on phosphorus atoms.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing resource&#8208;abundant and sustainable metal&#8208;free bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts is essential for the practical application of zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs). 2D black phosphorus (BP) with fully exposed atoms and active lone pair electrons can be promising for oxygen electrocatalysts, which, however, suffers from low catalytic activity and poor electrochemical stability. Herein, guided by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, an efficient metal&#8208;free electrocatalyst is demonstrated via covalently bonding BP nanosheets with graphitic carbon nitride (denoted BP&#8208;CN&#8208;&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;). The polarized P&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N covalent bonds in BP&#8208;CN&#8208;&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; can efficiently regulate the electron transfer from BP to graphitic carbon nitride and significantly promote the OOH* adsorption on phosphorus atoms. Impressively, the oxygen evolution reaction performance of BP&#8208;CN&#8208;&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; (overpotential of 350&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 90% retention after 10 h operation) represents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art among the reported BP&#8208;based metal&#8208;free catalysts. Additionally, BP&#8208;CN&#8208;&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; exhibits a small half&#8208;wave overpotential of 390&#160;mV for oxygen reduction reaction, representing the first bifunctional BP&#8208;based metal&#8208;free oxygen catalyst. Moreover, ZABs are assembled incorporating BP&#8208;CN&#8208;&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; cathodes, delivering a substantially higher peak power density (168.3&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) than the Pt/C+RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;based ZABs (101.3&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

         <title>Rapid Nitriding of Titanium Alloy with Fine Grains at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanical and tribological properties are important for titanium alloys, which are used as a biomaterial. Inspiration is taken from the transfer of fine particles to achieve rapid nitriding without heating. The developed room&#8208;temperature methods result in the formation of a nitrided layer within a short period. The proposed method has the potential to improve various properties in other metallic materials.








Abstract
Multifunctional surfaces are required to design safe engineering products for human lives. Heating in a nitrogen atmosphere (nitriding) improves the tribological properties but reduces the strength of titanium (Ti) alloys owing to grain coarsening. A rapid nitriding method for Ti alloys forms the nitrided layer on the surface of a Ti alloy by bombarding with commercially pure Ti fine particles with a nitrided phase at room temperature within a short period. Furthermore, fine grains of Ti alloy are formed in the nitrided layer because of the impact of the Ti particles. These results reveal that this room&#8208;temperature method resolves the trade&#8208;off between the rapid formation of a nitrided layer and the suppression of grain coarsening for Ti alloys.

         <title>Massively Parallel Arrays of Size&#8208;Controlled Metallic Nanogaps with Gap&#8208;Widths Down to the Sub&#8208;3&#8208;nm Level</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallic nanogaps (MNGs) are essential elements of nanoscale devices, but the lack of reproducible, high&#8208;yield fabrication methods has hindered practical applications. This work describes a simple, scalable approach for fabricating size&#8208;controlled MNGs with gap&#8208;widths as small as 3 nm. Applications of the technique include the fabrication of large&#8208;area plasmonic substrates formed from hundreds of millions of ring&#8208;shaped nanogaps.








Abstract
Metallic nanogaps (MNGs) are fundamental components of nanoscale photonic and electronic devices. However, the lack of reproducible, high&#8208;yield fabrication methods with nanometric control over the gap&#8208;size has hindered practical applications. A patterning technique based on molecular self&#8208;assembly and physical peeling is reported here that allows the gap&#8208;width to be tuned from more than 30&#160;nm to less than 3&#160;nm. The ability of the technique to define sub&#8208;3&#8208;nm gaps between dissimilar metals permits the easy fabrication of molecular rectifiers, in which conductive molecules bridge metals with differing work functions. A method is further described for fabricating massively parallel nanogap arrays containing hundreds of millions of ring&#8208;shaped nanogaps, in which nanometric size control is maintained over large patterning areas of up to a square centimeter. The arrays exhibit strong plasmonic resonances under visible light illumination and act as high&#8208;performance substrates for surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy, with high enhancement factors of up to 3 &#215; 108 relative to thin gold films. The methods described here extend the range of metallic nanostructures that can be fabricated over large areas, and are likely to find many applications in molecular electronics, plasmonics, and biosensing.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskites show high promise for electronic devices owing to exceptional electrical, optical, and structural properties. Herein, the latest breakthroughs in structural, interface, defect engineering, and pattering techniques as applied to halide perovskite transistors, memories and to improve stability issues in perovskites are reviewed. Lastly, the existing challenges and outline for future research directions are provided.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic mixed halide perovskites have emerged as an excellent class of materials with a unique combination of optoelectronic properties, suitable for a plethora of applications ranging from solar cells to light&#8208;emitting diodes and photoelectrochemical devices. Recent works have showcased hybrid perovskites for electronic applications through improvements in materials design, processing, and device stability. Herein, a comprehensive up&#8208;to&#8208;date review is presented on hybrid perovskite electronics with a focus on transistors and memories. These applications are supported by the fundamental material properties of hybrid perovskite semiconductors such as tunable bandgap, ambipolar charge transport, reasonable mobility, defect characteristics, and solution processability, which are highlighted first. Then, recent progresses on perovskite&#8208;based transistors are reviewed, covering aspects of fabrication process, patterning techniques, contact engineering, 2D versus 3D material selection, and device performance. Furthermore, applications of perovskites in nonvolatile memories and artificial synaptic devices are presented. The ambient instability of hybrid perovskites and the strategies to tackle this bottleneck are also discussed. Finally, an outlook and opportunities to develop perovskite&#8208;based electronics as a competitive and feasible technology are highlighted.

         <title>Sensing with MXenes: Progress and Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;like electrical conductivity and a large MXene surface area are desirable characteristics for alternative sensor material. This review offers an overview of recent advances in MXene&#8208;based sensor technology that utilize the beneficial properties of MXenes. It also provides insights into low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance MXene&#8208;based sensors for next generation soft&#8208;electronics applications.








Abstract
Various fields of study consider MXene a revolutionary 2D material. Particularly in the field of sensors, the metal&#8208;like high electrical conductivity and large surface area of MXenes are desirable characteristics as an alternative sensor material that can transcend the boundaries of existing sensor technology. This critical review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in MXene&#8208;based sensor technology and a roadmap for commercializing MXene&#8208;based sensors. The existing sensors are systematically categorized as chemical, biological, and physical sensors. Each category is then classified into various subcategories depending on the electrical, electrochemical, structural, or optical sensing mechanism, which are the four fundamental working mechanisms of sensors. Representative structural and electrical approaches for boosting the performance of each category are presented. Finally, factors that hinder commercializing MXene&#8208;based sensors are discussed, and several breakthroughs in realizing commercially available MXene&#8208;based sensors are suggested. This review provides broad insights pertaining to previous and existing MXene&#8208;based sensor technology and perspectives on the future generation of low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance, and multimodal sensors for soft&#8208;electronics applications.

         <title>Electronic and Magnetic Characterization of Epitaxial CrBr3 Monolayers on a Superconducting Substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic and magnetic properties of a 2D monolayer ferromagnet on a layered superconducting substrate is studied using different experimental techniques and theoretical calculations. It is confirmed that the chromium tribromide monolayer retains its ferromagnetic order and induces proximitized magnetism on the underlying superconductor niobium diselenide. The results contribute to the broader framework of exploiting proximity effects to realize novel phenomena in 2D heterostructures.








Abstract
The ability to imprint a given material property to another through a proximity effect in layered 2D materials has opened the way to the creation of designer materials. Here, molecular&#8208;beam epitaxy is used for direct synthesis of a superconductor&#8211;ferromagnet heterostructure by combining superconducting niobium diselenide (NbSe2) with the monolayer ferromagnetic chromium tribromide (CrBr3). Using different characterization techniques and density&#8208;functional theory calculations, it is confirmed that the CrBr3 monolayer retains its ferromagnetic ordering with a magnetocrystalline anisotropy favoring an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin orientation. Low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy measurements show a slight reduction of the superconducting gap of NbSe2 and the formation of a vortex lattice on the CrBr3 layer in experiments under an external magnetic field. The results contribute to the broader framework of exploiting proximity effects to realize novel phenomena in 2D&#160;heterostructures.

         <title>Graphene Energy Transfer for Single&#8208;Molecule Biophysics, Biosensing, and Super&#8208;Resolution Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene is a broadband and unbleachable energy&#8208;transfer acceptor with no need for labeling. To demonstrate the capabilities of graphene&#8208;on&#8208;glass coverslips, a variety of demonstration assays are placed on graphene using DNA origami nanopositioners. The results highlight the potential for single&#8208;molecule biophysics, biosensing, and super&#8208;resolution microscopy.








Abstract
Graphene is considered a game&#8208;changing material, especially for its mechanical and electrical properties. This work exploits that graphene is almost transparent but quenches fluorescence in a range up to &#8776;40 nm. Graphene as a broadband and unbleachable energy&#8208;transfer acceptor without labeling, is used to precisely determine the height of molecules with respect to graphene, to visualize the dynamics of DNA nanostructures, and to determine the orientation of F&#246;rster&#8208;type resonance energy transfer (FRET) pairs. Using DNA origami nanopositioners, biosensing, single&#8208;molecule tracking, and DNA PAINT super&#8208;resolution with &lt;3 nm z&#8208;resolution are demonstrated. The range of examples shows the potential of graphene&#8208;on&#8208;glass coverslips as a versatile platform for single&#8208;molecule biophysics, biosensing, and super&#8208;resolution microscopy.

         <title>Switching of a Magnet by Spin&#8208;Orbit Torque from a Topological Dirac Semimetal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature switching of magnetization in a CoFeB thin film by a spin&#8208;orbit torque from a neighboring topological Dirac semimetal &#945;&#8208;Sn thin film is reported. The &#945;&#8208;Sn film is grown by sputtering on a silicon substrate. The switching is driven mainly by the topological surface states in the &#945;&#8208;Sn. The switching efficiency is comparable to that in topological&#8208;insulator&#8208;based structures.








Abstract
Recent experiments show that topological surface states (TSS) in topological insulators (TI) can be exploited to manipulate magnetic ordering in ferromagnets. In principle, TSS should also exist for other topological materials, but it remains unexplored as to whether such states can also be utilized to manipulate ferromagnets. Herein, current&#8208;induced magnetization switching enabled by TSS in a non&#8208;TI topological material, namely, a topological Dirac semimetal &#945;&#8208;Sn, is reported. The experiments use an &#945;&#8208;Sn/Ag/CoFeB trilayer structure. The magnetization in the CoFeB layer can be switched by a charge current at room temperature, without an external magnetic field. The data show that the switching is driven by the TSS of the &#945;&#8208;Sn layer, rather than spin&#8208;orbit coupling in the bulk of the &#945;&#8208;Sn layer or current&#8208;produced heating. The switching efficiency is as high as in TI systems. This shows that the topological Dirac semimetal &#945;&#8208;Sn is as promising as TI materials in terms of spintronic applications.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered In Situ Gelation of Hydrogels using 2D Molybdenum Disulfide (MoS2) Nanoassemblies as Crosslink Epicenter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;triggered in situ gelation of nanoengineered hydrogels using 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanoassemblies is demonstrated. The in situ gelation of nanoengineered hydrogels has strong potential for a range of biomedical applications, including phototherapy, 3D printing, and therapeutic delivery.








Abstract
Light&#8208;responsive biomaterials are an emerging class of materials used for developing noninvasive, noncontact, precise, and controllable biomedical devices. Long&#8208;wavelength near&#8208;infrared (NIR) radiation is an attractive light source for in situ gelation due to its higher penetration depth and minimum side effects. The conventional approach to obtain crosslinked biomaterials relies heavily on the use of a photoinitiator by generating reactive species when exposed to short&#8208;wavelength radiation, which is detrimental to surrounding cells and tissue. Here, a new class of NIR&#8208;triggered in situ gelation system based on defect&#8208;rich 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanoassemblies and thiol&#8208;functionalized thermoresponsive polymer in the absence of a photoinitiator is introduced. Exposure to NIR radiation activates the dynamic polymer&#8211;nanomaterials interactions by leveraging the photothermal characteristics of MoS2 and intrinsic phase transition ability of the thermoresponsive polymer. Specifically, upon NIR exposure, MoS2 acts as a crosslink epicenter by connecting with multiple polymeric chains via defect&#8208;driven click chemistry. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the utility of NIR&#8208;triggered in situ gelation is demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, the crosslinked gel exhibits the potential for NIR light&#8208;responsive release of encapsulated therapeutics. These light&#8208;responsive biomaterials have strong potential for a range of biomedical applications, including artificial muscle, smart actuators, 3D/4D printing, regenerative medicine, and therapeutic delivery.

         <title>Mechanism and Timescales of Reversible p&#8208;Doping of Methylammonium Lead Triiodide by Oxygen</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylammonium lead triiodide thin films exhibit intrinsic semiconductor electronic properties in the absence of oxygen. Exposure to oxygen or air leads to pronounced p&#8208;doping throughout the films, predominantly due to molecular oxygen substitution of iodine vacancies. This mechanism is reversible, and oxygen&#8208;doped films return to intrinsic upon storage in ultrahigh vacuum.








Abstract
Understanding and controlling the energy level alignment at interfaces with metal halide perovskites (MHPs) is essential for realizing the full potential of these materials for use in optoelectronic devices. To date, however, the basic electronic properties of MHPs are still under debate. Particularly, reported Fermi level positions in the energy gap vary from indicating strong n&#8208; to strong p&#8208;type character for nominally identical materials, raising serious questions about intrinsic and extrinsic defects as dopants. &#8203;In this work, photoemission experiments demonstrate that thin films of the prototypical methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) behave like an intrinsic semiconductor in the absence of oxygen. Oxygen is then shown to be able to reversibly diffuse into and out of the MAPbI3 bulk, requiring rather long saturation timescales of &#8776;1 h (in: ambient air) and over 10 h (out: ultrahigh vacuum), for few 100&#160;nm thick films. Oxygen in the bulk leads to pronounced p&#8208;doping, positioning the Fermi level universally &#8776;0.55&#160;eV above the valence band maximum. The key doping mechanism is suggested to be molecular oxygen substitution of iodine vacancies, supported by density functional theory calculations. This insight rationalizes previous and future electronic property studies of MHPs and calls for meticulous oxygen exposure protocols.

This insight rationalizes previous and future electronic property studies of MHPs and calls for meticulous oxygen exposure protocols.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Design of Chemically Stable Organic Perovskite Quantum Dots for Micropatterned Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes through Kinetic Control of a Cross&#8208;Linkable Ligand System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fast degradation of perovskite quantum dots (QDs) prevents the development of multicolor patterning technologies using these materials. Therefore, novel ligand systems for microsized EL device fabrication, which protect perovskite QDs from degradation through the binding kinetic control of surface ligands, are developed. The present system remains stable in various chemical environments, without critical deterioration of optical and electrical properties.








Abstract
Perovskite quantum dot (QD) light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are ideal for next&#8208;generation display applications because of their excellent color purity, high efficiency, and cost&#8208;effective fabrication. However, developing a technology for high&#8208;resolution multicolor patterning of perovskite QDs remains challenging, owing to the chemical instability of these materials. To overcome these issues, in this work, the generation of surface defects is prevented by controlling the ligand&#8208;binding kinetics using a stable ligand system (Stable LS). The crystalline reconstruction of perovskite QDs after addition of the Stable LS results in an &#8776;18% increase in their photoluminescence quantum yield in solution and it also improves the ambient stability of the perovskite QD solution. Moreover, the perovskite QDs with Stable LS can undergo cross&#8208;linking under UV irradiation. The tightly bridged perovskite QDs effectively prevent moisture&#8208;assisted ligand dissociation in film state due to the increased hydrophobicity and restricted movement of the cross&#8208;linked surface ligands. Thus, the cross&#8208;linked perovskite QD film shows improved chemical/environmental stability without substantial deterioration in optoelectrical properties. As a result, a white electroluminescent device with high resolution (&#8776;1 &#956;m) is successfully fabricated by inkjet printing using green and red perovskite QDs.

         <title>Thickness&#8208;Dependent Elastic Softening of Few&#8208;Layer Free&#8208;Standing MoSe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in&#8208;plane elastic constants of a few&#8208;layer suspended 2H&#8208;MoSe2 soften about 30% while decreasing the thickness from bulk to three&#8208;layers. The results obtained employing the contactless technique indicate the so&#8208;called negative elastic size&#8208;effect.








Abstract
Few&#8208;layer van der Waals (vdW) materials have been extensively investigated in terms of their exceptional electronic, optoelectronic, optical, and thermal properties. Simultaneously, a complete evaluation of their mechanical properties remains an undeniable challenge due to the small lateral sizes of samples and the limitations of experimental tools. In particular, there is no systematic experimental study providing unambiguous evidence on whether the reduction of vdW thickness down to few layers results in elastic softening or stiffening with respect to the bulk. In this work, micro&#8208;Brillouin light scattering is employed to investigate the anisotropic elastic properties of single&#8208;crystal free&#8208;standing 2H&#8208;MoSe2 as a function of thickness, down to three molecular layers. The so&#8208;called elastic size effect, that is, significant and systematic elastic softening of the material with decreasing numbers of layers is reported. In addition, this approach allows for a complete mechanical examination of few&#8208;layer membranes, that is, their elasticity, residual stress, and thickness, which can be easily extended to other vdW materials. The presented results shed new light on the ongoing debate on the elastic size&#8208;effect and are relevant for performance and durability of implementation of vdW materials as resonators, optoelectronic, and thermoelectric&#160;devices.

         <title>Simultaneously Toughening and Stiffening Elastomers with Octuple Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired multifunctional elastomer with both high fracture toughness and high Young's modulus is designed, breaking through the current trade&#8208;off present in the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. The octuple hydrogen bonding promotes the formation of ultrastrong nanodomains, which, together with a soft poly(dimethylsiloxane)&#8208;rich phase, form a bicontinuous network structure. Such hierarchical networks with ultrastrong nanodomains enhance the mechanical properties.








Abstract
Current synthetic elastomers suffer from the well&#8208;known trade&#8208;off between toughness and stiffness. By a combination of multiscale experiments and atomistic simulations, a transparent unfilled elastomer with simultaneously enhanced toughness and stiffness is demonstrated. The designed elastomer comprises homogeneous networks with ultrastrong, reversible, and sacrificial octuple hydrogen bonding (HB), which evenly distribute the stress to each polymer chain during loading, thus enhancing stretchability and delaying fracture. Strong HBs and corresponding nanodomains enhance the stiffness by restricting the network mobility, and at the same time improve the toughness by dissipating energy during the transformation between different configurations. In addition, the stiffness mismatch between the hard HB domain and the soft poly(dimethylsiloxane)&#8208;rich phase promotes crack deflection and branching, which can further dissipate energy and alleviate local stress. These cooperative mechanisms endow the elastomer with both high fracture toughness (17016 J m&#8722;2) and high Young's modulus (14.7&#160;MPa), circumventing the trade&#8208;off between toughness and stiffness. This work is expected to impact many fields of engineering requiring elastomers with unprecedented mechanical performance.

         <title>Small&#8208;Scale Magnetic Actuators with Optimal Six Degrees&#8208;of&#8208;Freedom</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic miniature robots (MMRs) are small, untethered actuators that can be controlled by magnetic fields. This work introduces optimal MMRs that can display unprecedented dexterity, manipulation capabilities, and soft&#8208;bodied mechanical functionalities. It is envisioned that this work can inspire future MMRs to be significantly more competent across a vast range of applications in robotics, materials science, and biomedicine.








Abstract
Magnetic miniature robots (MMRs) are small&#8208;scale, untethered actuators which can be controlled by magnetic fields. As these actuators can non&#8208;invasively access highly confined and enclosed spaces; they have great potential to revolutionize numerous applications in robotics, materials science, and biomedicine. While the creation of MMRs with six&#8208;degrees&#8208;of&#8208;freedom (six&#8208;DOF) represents a major advancement for this class of actuators, these robots are not widely adopted due to two critical limitations: i) under precise orientation control, these MMRs have slow sixth&#8208;DOF angular velocities (4&#160;degree s&#8722;1) and it is difficult to apply desired magnetic forces on them; ii) such MMRs cannot perform soft&#8208;bodied functionalities. Here a fabrication method that can magnetize optimal MMRs to produce 51&#8211;297&#8208;fold larger sixth&#8208;DOF torque than existing small&#8208;scale, magnetic actuators is introduced. A universal actuation method that is applicable for rigid and soft MMRs with six&#8208;DOF is also proposed. Under precise orientation control, the optimal MMRs can execute full six&#8208;DOF motions reliably and achieve sixth&#8208;DOF angular velocities of 173&#160;degree s&#8722;1. The soft MMRs can display unprecedented functionalities; the six&#8208;DOF jellyfish&#8208;like robot can swim across barriers impassable by existing similar devices and the six&#8208;DOF gripper is 20&#8208;folds quicker than its five&#8208;DOF predecessor in completing a complicated, small&#8208;scale assembly.

         <title>Electronic Drugs: Spatial and Temporal Medical Treatment of Human Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electronic drugs (e&#8208;drugs) for spatial and temporal medical treatment of human diseases are of great importance for the development of advanced biomedical integrated devices to solve unmet medical challenges. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances in e&#8208;drugs are systematically introduced in terms of their device types and targeting diseases. An outlook and challenges for future research are also provided.








Abstract
Recent advances in diagnostics and medicines emphasize the spatial and temporal aspects of monitoring and treating diseases. However, conventional therapeutics, including oral administration and injection, have difficulties meeting these aspects due to physiological and technological limitations, such as long&#8208;term implantation and a narrow therapeutic window. As an innovative approach to overcome these limitations, electronic devices known as electronic drugs (e&#8208;drugs) have been developed to monitor real&#8208;time body signals and deliver specific treatments to targeted tissues or organs. For example, ingestible and patch&#8208;type e&#8208;drugs could detect changes in biomarkers at the target sites, including the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the skin, and deliver therapeutics to enhance healing in a spatiotemporal manner. However, medical treatments often require invasive surgical procedures and implantation of medical equipment for either short or long&#8208;term use. Therefore, approaches that could minimize implantation&#8208;associated side effects, such as inflammation and scar tissue formation, while maintaining high functionality of e&#8208;drugs, are highly needed. Herein, the importance of the spatial and temporal aspects of medical treatment is thoroughly reviewed along with how e&#8208;drugs use cutting&#8208;edge technological innovations to deal with unresolved medical challenges.

&lt;p&gt;Electronic drugs (e&#8208;drugs) for spatial and temporal medical treatment of human diseases are of great importance for the development of advanced biomedical integrated devices to solve unmet medical challenges. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances in e&#8208;drugs are systematically introduced in terms of their device types and targeting diseases. An outlook and challenges for future research are also provided.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent advances in diagnostics and medicines emphasize the spatial and temporal aspects of monitoring and treating diseases. However, conventional therapeutics, including oral administration and injection, have difficulties meeting these aspects due to physiological and technological limitations, such as long&#8208;term implantation and a narrow therapeutic window. As an innovative approach to overcome these limitations, electronic devices known as electronic drugs (e&#8208;drugs) have been developed to monitor real&#8208;time body signals and deliver specific treatments to targeted tissues or organs. For example, ingestible and patch&#8208;type e&#8208;drugs could detect changes in biomarkers at the target sites, including the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the skin, and deliver therapeutics to enhance healing in a spatiotemporal manner. However, medical treatments often require invasive surgical procedures and implantation of medical equipment for either short or long&#8208;term use. Therefore, approaches that could minimize implantation&#8208;associated side effects, such as inflammation and scar tissue formation, while maintaining high functionality of e&#8208;drugs, are highly needed. Herein, the importance of the spatial and temporal aspects of medical treatment is thoroughly reviewed along with how e&#8208;drugs use cutting&#8208;edge technological innovations to deal with unresolved medical challenges. Furthermore, diverse uses of e&#8208;drugs in clinical applications and the future perspectives of e&#8208;drugs are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Beyond Color: The New Carbon Ink</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For more than 30&#160;000&#160;years, carbon ink has mainly been used as a black color pigment. However, the recent discovery of nanocarbon materials with remarkable physical and chemical properties enables new applications well beyond coloring. This article reviews recent advances in the development of nanocarbon inks and their emergent applications, highlighting the fundamental and technical challenges as well as opportunities.








Abstract
For thousands of years, carbon ink has been used as a black color pigment for writing and painting purposes. However, recent discoveries of nanocarbon materials, including fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, graphene, and their various derivative forms, together with the advances in large&#8208;scale synthesis, are enabling a whole new generation of carbon inks that can serve as an intrinsically programmable materials platform for developing advanced functionalities far beyond color. The marriage between these multifunctional nanocarbon inks with modern printing technologies is facilitating and even transforming many applications, including flexible electronics, wearable and implantable sensors, actuators, and autonomous robotics. This review examines recent progress in the reborn field of carbon inks, highlighting their programmability and multifunctionality for applications in flexible electronics and stimuli&#8208;responsive devices. Current challenges and opportunities will also be discussed from a materials science perspective towards the advancement of carbon ink for new applications beyond color.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The current panorama of hydrogel&#8208;based photonics and advances in fabrication techniques towards functional optical architectures are reviewed, evaluating their capabilities in the biomedical field. Further, the future potential for hydrogel photonic constructs to integrate into live tissues, advanced biosensing platforms, microrobotics, photomedicine, and lab&#8208;on&#8208;chip technologies are discussed.








Abstract
Light guiding and manipulation in photonics have become ubiquitous in events ranging from everyday communications to complex robotics and nanomedicine. The speed and sensitivity of light&#8211;matter interactions offer unprecedented advantages in biomedical optics, data transmission, photomedicine, and detection of multi&#8208;scale phenomena. Recently, hydrogels have emerged as a promising candidate for interfacing photonics and bioengineering by combining their light&#8208;guiding properties with live tissue compatibility in optical, chemical, physiological, and mechanical dimensions. Herein, the latest progress over hydrogel photonics and its applications in guidance and manipulation of light is reviewed. Physics of guiding light through hydrogels and living tissues, and existing technical challenges in translating these tools into biomedical settings are discussed. A&#160;comprehensive and thorough overview of materials, fabrication protocols, and design architectures used in hydrogel photonics is provided. Finally, recent examples of applying structures such as hydrogel optical fibers, living photonic constructs, and their use as light&#8208;driven hydrogel robots, photomedicine tools, and organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip models are described. By providing a critical and selective evaluation of the field's status, this work sets a foundation for the next generation of hydrogel photonic research.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Stretchable Ag2S Semiconductor Thin Films for Wearable Self&#8208;Powered Nonvolatile Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solution&#8208;processed synthesis of intrinsically stretchable Ag2S thin films for fabrication of self&#8208;powered stretchable resistive memory devices is presented. The device exhibits excellent switching characteristics and mechanical stretchability (52%), and extremely high thermal and environmental durability (168 h in 85 &#176;C/85% relative humidity). A self&#8208;powered memory combined with motion sensors for use as a wearable healthcare monitoring system is demonstrated.








Abstract
Compared with the large plastic deformation observed in ductile metals and organic materials, inorganic semiconductors have limited plasticity (&lt;0.2%) due to their intrinsic bonding characters, restricting their widespread applications in stretchable electronics. Herein, the solution&#8208;processed synthesis of ductile &#945;&#8208;Ag2S thin films and fabrication of all&#8208;inorganic, self&#8208;powered, and stretchable memory devices, is reported. Molecular Ag2S complex solution is synthesized by chemical reduction of Ag2S powder, fabricating wafer&#8208;scale highly crystalline Ag2S thin films. The thin films show stretchability due to the intrinsic ductility, sustaining the structural integrity at a tensile strain of 14.9%. Moreover, the fabricated Ag2S&#8208;based resistive random access memory presents outstanding bipolar switching characteristics (Ion/Ioff ratio of &#8776;105, operational endurance of 100 cycles, and retention time &gt;106 s) as well as excellent mechanical stretchability (no degradation of properties up to stretchability of 52%). Meanwhile, the device is highly durable under diverse chemical environments and temperatures from &#8722;196 to 300 &#176;C, especially maintaining the properties for 168 h in 85% relative humidity and 85 &#176;C. A self&#8208;powered memory combined with motion sensors for use as a wearable healthcare monitoring system is demonstrated, offering the potential for designing high&#8208;performance wearable electronics that are usable in daily life in a real&#8208;world setting.

         <title>Disorder&#8208;Induced Material&#8208;Insensitive Optical Response in Plasmonic Nanostructures: Vibrant Structural Colors from Noble Metals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The optical response of materials, either at the macroscale or the nanoscale, is determined by their unique dielectric functions. Assisted by intrinsic disorder in fabrication, material&#8208;insensitive reflection is achieved from plasmonic nanostructures composed of different noble metals. The disorder&#8208;induced disentanglement between the optical response and the material properties may inspire novel applications ranging from photocatalysis to Raman spectroscopy.








Abstract
Materials show various responses to incident light, owing to their unique dielectric functions. A well&#8208;known example is the distinct colors displayed by metals, providing probably the simplest method to identify gold, silver, and bronze since ancient times. With the advancement of nanotechnology, optical structures with feature sizes smaller than the optical wavelength have been routinely achieved. In this regime, the optical response is also determined by the geometry of the nanostructures, inspiring flourishing progress in plasmonics, photonic crystals, and metamaterials. Nevertheless, the nature of the materials still plays a decisive role in light&#8211;matter interactions, and this material&#8208;dependent optical response is widely accepted as a norm in nanophotonics. Here, a counterintuitive system&#8212;plasmonic nanostructures composed of different materials but exhibiting almost identical reflection&#8212;is proposed and realized. The geometric disorder embedded in the system overwhelms the contribution of the material properties to the electrodynamics. Both numerical simulations and experimental results provide concrete evidence of the insensitivity of the optical response to different plasmonic materials. The same optical response is preserved with various materials, providing great flexibility of freedom in material selection. As a result, the proposed configuration may shed light on novel applications ranging from Raman spectroscopy, photocatalysis, to nonlinear&#160;optics.

         <title>Stereoisomerization during Molecular Packing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new isomerization phenomenon occurring during molecular packing is reported. Such a new type of isomerization tends to offer tight molecular packing with less voids in stacking, resulting in unique packing with abundant CH&#8230;&#960; interactions. The unique packing in the solid state favors the restriction of intramolecular motion, resulting in highly efficient organic solids with quantum yields approaching unity.








Abstract
Isomerization is an essential chemical process that often evokes dramatic change of chemical, physical, or biological properties. For a long time, isomerization has been known as a transformation that is induced by certain external energy such as light, heat, or mechanical force. Herein, a new isomerization phenomenon is described, which does not require external energy but simply occurs during molecular packing. The proposed isomerization is demonstrated by a series of symmetric donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) molecules, the donor of which may adopt two different stereoisomeric forms. Based on the evidence of the asymmetric isomers in crystals, the occurrence of isomerization during molecular packing is proved. Moreover, the unique asymmetric geometry in the solid state favors the restriction of intramolecular motion, resulting in highly efficient organic solids with quantum yields approaching unity.

         <title>General Synthesis of Ultrafine Monodispersed Hybrid Nanoparticles from Highly Stable Monomicelles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of ultrasmall hybrid nanoparticles with great uniformity, monodispersity, and tunable shell thickness is successfully synthesized by a facile thermo&#8208;kinetics&#8208;mediated copolymer monomicelle approach. This monomicelle with a solidified polystyrene core has ultrahigh thermodynamic stability. Combined with a unique core&#8211;shell&#8211;corona structure, this monomicelle is a very general template to synthesize various ultrasmall, monodispersed hybrid nanoparticles with excellent uniformity.








Abstract
Ultrafine nanoparticles with organic&#8211;inorganic hybridization have essential roles in myriad applications. Over the past three decades, although various efforts on the formation of organic or inorganic ultrasmall nanoparticles have been made, ultrafine organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid nanoparticles have scarcely been achieved. Herein, a family of ultrasmall hybrid nanoparticles with a monodisperse, uniform size is synthesized by a facile thermo&#8208;kinetics&#8208;mediated copolymer monomicelle approach. These thermo&#8208;kinetics&#8208;mediated monomicelles with amphiphilic ABC triblock copolymers are structurally robust due to their solidified polystyrene core, endowing them with ultrahigh thermodynamic stability, which is difficult to achieve using Pluronic surfactant&#8208;based micelles (e.g., F127). This great stability combined with a core&#8211;shell&#8211;corona structure makes the monodispersed monomicelles a robust template for the precise synthesis of ultrasmall hybrid nanoparticles with a highly uniform size. As a demonstration, the obtained micelles/SiO2 hybrid nanoparticles display ultrafine sizes, excellent uniformity, monodispersity, and tunable structural parameters (diameters: 24&#8211;47 nm and thin shell thickness: 2.0&#8211;4.0 nm). Notably, this approach is universal for creating a variety of multifunctional ultrasmall hybrid nanostructures, involving organic/organic micelle/polymers (polydopamine) nanoparticles, organic/inorganic micelle/metal oxides (ZnO, TiO2, Fe2O3), micelle/hydroxides (Co(OH)2), micelle/noble metals (Ag), and micelle/TiO2/SiO2 hybrid composites. As a proof of concept, the ultrasmall micelle/SiO2 hybrid nanoparticles demonstrate superior toughness as biomimetic materials.

         <title>A Quinoxaline&#8208;Based D&#8211;A Copolymer Donor Achieving 17.62% Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two D&#8211;A copolymers, PBQ5 and PBQ6, are designed and synthesized based on difluoroquinoxaline (DFQ) units with different side chains. The organic solar cell (OSC) based on PBQ6 as donor and Y6 as acceptor achieves a high power conversion efficiency of 17.62%, which is one of the highest efficiencies for binary OSCs with a polymer donor and Y6 acceptor.








Abstract
Side&#8208;chain engineering has been an effective strategy in tuning electronic energy levels, intermolecular interaction, and aggregation morphology of organic photovoltaic materials, which is very important for improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, two D&#8211;A copolymers, PBQ5 and PBQ6, are designed and synthesized based on bithienyl&#8208;benzodithiophene (BDTT) as the donor (D) unit, difluoroquinoxaline (DFQ) with different side chains as the acceptor (A) unit, and thiophene as the &#960;&#8208;bridges. PBQ6 with two alkyl&#8208;substituted fluorothiophene side chains on the DFQ units possesses redshifted absorption, stronger intermolecular interaction, and higher hole mobility than PBQ5 with two alkyl side chains on the DFQ units. The blend film of the PBQ6 donor with the Y6 acceptor shows higher and balanced hole/electron mobilities, less charge carrier recombination, and more favorable aggregation morphology. Therefore, the OSC based on PBQ6:Y6 achieves a PCE as high as 17.62% with a high fill factor of 77.91%, which is significantly higher than the PCE (15.55%) of the PBQ5:Y6&#8208;based OSC. The PCE of 17.62% is by far one of the highest efficiencies for the binary OSCs with polymer donor and Y6 acceptor.

         <title>MIL&#8208;101&#8208;Derived Mesoporous Carbon Supporting Highly Exposed Fe Single&#8208;Atom Sites as Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoporous Fe single&#8208;atom catalysts (Fe SAC&#8208;MIL101&#8208;T) are successfully synthesized using NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101(Al)&#8208;derived N&#8208;doped carbon as supports. The abundant mesopores in the supports promote mass transport during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and ensure a high proportion of FeNx sites are accessible. Fe SAC&#8208;MIL101&#8208;1000 demonstrates outstanding activity for ORR and excellent performance in both aqueous and solid&#8208;state zinc&#8211;air batteries.








Abstract
Fe single&#8208;atom catalysts (Fe SACs) with atomic FeNx active sites are very promising alternatives to platinum&#8208;based catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The pyrolysis of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is a common approach for preparing Fe SACs, though most MOF&#8208;derived catalysts reported to date are microporous and thus suffer from poor mass transfer and a high proportion of catalytically inaccessible FeNx active sites. Herein, NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101(Al), a MOF possessing a mesoporous cage architecture, is used as the precursor to prepare a series of N&#8208;doped carbon supports (denoted herein as NC&#8208;MIL101&#8208;T) with a well&#8208;defined mesoporous structure at different pyrolysis temperatures. The NC&#8208;MIL101&#8208;T supports are then impregnated with a Fe(II)&#8208;phenanthroline complex, and heated again to yield Fe SAC&#8208;MIL101&#8208;T catalysts rich in accessible FeNx single atom sites. The best performing Fe SAC&#8208;MIL101&#8208;1000 catalyst offers outstanding ORR activity in alkaline media, evidenced by an ORR half&#8208;wave potential of 0.94&#160;V (vs RHE) in 0.1 m KOH, as well as excellent performance in both aqueous primary zinc&#8211;air batteries (a near maximum theoretical energy density of 984.2&#160;Wh kgZn&#8722;1) and solid&#8208;state zinc&#8211;air batteries (a peak power density of 50.6&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and a specific capacity of 724.0 mAh kgZn&#8722;1).

         <title>Designing Copper&#8208;Based Catalysts for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on recent advances in Cu&#8208;based catalysts for CO2 and CO electroreduction to multi&#8208;carbon products. Progress in mechanistic investigations is summarized, including the formation and adsorption of CO, C&#8208;C coupling, and post&#8208;C&#8208;C&#8208;coupling steps. Catalyst design strategies derived from the mechanistic insights are then discussed. Finally, challenges and perspectives of the future CO2 reduction development are provided.








Abstract
The electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) has been emerging as a high&#8208; potential approach for CO2 utilization using renewables. When copper (Cu) based catalysts are used, this platform can produce multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) fuels and chemicals with almost net&#8208;zero emission, contributing to the closure of the anthropogenic carbon cycle. Nonetheless, the rational design and development of Cu&#8208;based catalysts are critical toward the realization of highly selective and efficient CO2 electroreduction. In this review, first the latest advances in Cu&#8208;catalyzed CO2 electroreduction in the product selectivity and electrocatalytic activity are briefly summarized.

     alt="Designing Copper&#8208;Based Catalysts for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review focuses on recent advances in Cu&#8208;based catalysts for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO electroreduction to multi&#8208;carbon products. Progress in mechanistic investigations is summarized, including the formation and adsorption of CO, C&#8208;C coupling, and post&#8208;C&#8208;C&#8208;coupling steps. Catalyst design strategies derived from the mechanistic insights are then discussed. Finally, challenges and perspectives of the future CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction development are provided.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) has been emerging as a high&#8208; potential approach for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; utilization using renewables. When copper (Cu) based catalysts are used, this platform can produce multi&#8208;carbon (C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt;) fuels and chemicals with almost net&#8208;zero emission, contributing to the closure of the anthropogenic carbon cycle. Nonetheless, the rational design and development of Cu&#8208;based catalysts are critical toward the realization of highly selective and efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction. In this review, first the latest advances in Cu&#8208;catalyzed CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction in the product selectivity and electrocatalytic activity are briefly summarized. Then, recent theoretical and mechanistic studies of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction on Cu&#8208;based catalysts are investigated, which serve as programs to design catalysts. Strategies for devising Cu catalysts that aim at promoting different key elementary steps for hydrocarbon and C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; oxygenates production are further summarized. Moreover, challenges in understanding the mechanism, operando investigation of Cu catalysts and reactions, and systems&#8217; influences are also presented. Finally, the future prospects of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Amorphous Domains in Black Titanium Dioxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the diffusion of oxygen vacancies from the surface to inside, the regional dual structure with anisotropic oxygen vacancies at both the surface and in the interior of TiO2 is obtained by constructing amorphous domains. The as&#8208;prepared sample exhibits superior catalytic activity, which can immediately degrade rhodamine B solution to colorless with a shake.








Abstract
Although oxygen vacancies (Ovs) play a critical role for many applications of metal oxides, a controllable synthetic strategy for anisotropic Ovs remains a great challenge. Here, a novel strategy is proposed to achieve the regional dual structure with anisotropic Ovs at both the surface and in the interior of TiO2 by constructing amorphous domains. The as&#8208;prepared black TiO2 with amorphous domains exhibits superior activity in degrading rhodamine B (RhB) solutions, which can instantly decompose RhB with just a shake. First&#8208;principle simulations reveal that subsurface Ovs in TiO2 are energetically favored, resulting in the formation of amorphous domains in the interior region via diffusion of surface&#8208;formed Ovs into the subsurface. The stable Ov&#8208;induced amorphous domains in TiO2 with enhanced catalytic performances provide a scalable strategy to practical Ov engineering in functional metal oxides.

         <title>Spontaneous Pillaring of Pentasil Zeolites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spontaneous formation of self&#8208;pillared pentasil zeolites in the absence of any template is demonstrated via heterogeneous nucleation of sequentially branched nanosheets from amorphous precursors. These hierarchical zeolites have a large external surface area and high percentages of external acid sites, which markedly improves their catalytic performance. These findings highlight a facile method to reduce mass&#8208;transport limitations in nanoporous zeolites.








Abstract
Conventional methods to prepare hierarchical zeolites depend upon the use of organic structure&#8208;directing agents and often require multiple synthesis steps with limited product yield and Br&#248;nsted acid concentration. Here, it is shown that the use of MEL&#8208; or MFI&#8208;type zeolites as crystalline seeds induces the spontaneous formation of self&#8208;pillared pentasil zeolites, thus avoiding the use of any organic or branching template for the crystallization of these hierarchical structures. The mechanism of formation is evaluated by time&#8208;resolved electron microscopy to provide evidence for the heterogeneous nucleation and growth of sequentially branched nanosheets from amorphous precursors. The resulting hierarchical zeolites have large external surface area and high percentages of external acid sites, which markedly improves their catalytic performance in the Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation and methanol to hydrocarbons reactions. These findings highlight a facile, commercially viable synthesis method to reduce mass&#8208;transport limitations and improve the performance of zeolite catalysts.

         <title>2D MXenes: Tunable Mechanical and Tribological Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 17, April 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXenes have grown to prominence due to their impressive conductive and electrochemical behavior. Although the mechanical and tribological properties are critical in almost all MXenes applications, they are yet to be fully explored. An in&#8208;depth perspective of the fundamental understanding of MXenes&#8217; mechanical and tribological properties and their effects on current and future applications is provided.








Abstract
2D transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides, known as MXenes, were discovered in 2011 and have grown to prominence in energy storage, catalysis, electromagnetic interference shielding, wireless communications, electronic, sensors, and environmental and biomedical applications. In addition to their high electrical conductivity and electrochemically active behavior, MXenes&#8217; mechanical properties, flexibility, and strong adhesion properties play crucial roles in almost all of these growing applications. Although these properties prove to be critical in MXenes&#8217; impressive performance, the mechanical and tribological understanding of MXenes, as well as their relation to the synthesis process, is yet to be fully explored. Here, a fundamental overview of MXenes&#8217; mechanical and tribological properties is provided and the effects of MXenes&#8217; compositions, synthesis, and processing steps on these properties are discussed. Additionally, a critical perspective of the compositional control of MXenes for innovative structural, low&#8208;friction, and low&#8208;wear performance in current and upcoming applications of MXenes is provided. It is established here that the fundamental understanding of MXenes&#8217; mechanical and tribological behavior is essential for their quickly growing applications.

         <title>Plasmonic Alloys Reveal a Distinct Metabolic Phenotype of Early Gastric Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 17, April 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trimetallic PdPtAu alloys with optimized elemental composition and surface structure benefit enhanced laser desorption/ionization, with photoinduced charge/energy transfer and size&#8208;exclusive effect. By further coupling with mass spectrometry, PdPtAu alloys yield direct metabolic profiling of trace plasma in seconds. A gastric cancer (GC)&#8208;specific metabolic phenotype is identified, shedding light on the precise and non&#8208;invasive GC diagnosis at an early stage.








Abstract
Gastric cancer (GC) is a multifactorial process, accompanied by alterations in metabolic pathways. Non&#8208;invasive metabolic profiling facilitates GC diagnosis at early stage leading to an improved prognostic outcome. Herein, mesoporous PdPtAu alloys are designed to characterize the metabolic profiles in human blood. The elemental composition is optimized with heterogeneous surface plasmonic resonance, offering preferred charge transfer for photoinduced desorption/ionization and enhanced photothermal conversion for thermally driven desorption. The surface structure of PdPtAu is further tuned with controlled mesopores, accommodating metabolites only, rather than large interfering compounds. Consequently, the optimized PdPtAu alloy yields direct metabolic fingerprints by laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry in seconds, consuming 500 nL of native plasma. A distinct metabolic phenotype is revealed for early GC by sparse learning, resulting in precise GC diagnosis with an area under the curve of 0.942. It is envisioned that the plasmonic alloy will open up a new era of minimally invasive blood analysis to improve the surveillance of cancer patients in the clinical setting.

         <title>Nanoburl Graphites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 17, April 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the strengthening mechanism of burls in tree trunks, nanodiamond particles converted into graphite onions are used as &#8220;nanoburls&#8221; that are embedded in graphite (0002) planes to stop cleavage along the graphite (0002) planes, significantly strengthening the bulk graphites.








Abstract
A critical challenge for the application of graphite is low strength, which originates from the easy cleavage of graphite (0002) planes. Inspired by the burl strengthening mechanism observed in tree trunks, nanodiamond particles converted into graphite onions are used as &#8220;nanoburls&#8221; embedded in graphite (0002) lattice planes to eliminate the graphite (0002) plane cleavage of bulk graphites prepared by spark plasma sintering from graphite powders. Covalent bonds are built between carbon atoms by sp3 hybridization at the interface between the graphite onions and flakes, which triggers an electron redistribution to form positive/negative charge domains within. Thus, pairs of pseudo&#8208;Schottky junctions are created by the hybridization, which further enhances the bonding between the graphite onions and flakes. With these bonding mechanisms, and with voids between the graphite powders filled in by the volume expansion associated with the change of nanodiamonds to the graphite onions, the loose compaction of graphite powder becomes consolidated at 1700&#160;&#176;C. The proposed nanoburl mechanism shows its potential and bestows the nanoburl graphites with strength five times that of conventional graphites prepared from graphite powders. The concept of nanoburl strengthening can be important in the microstructural design and property enhancement of other layered materials.

     alt="Nanoburl Graphites"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the strengthening mechanism of burls in tree trunks, nanodiamond particles converted into graphite onions are used as &#8220;nanoburls&#8221; that are embedded in graphite (0002) planes to stop cleavage along the graphite (0002) planes, significantly strengthening the bulk graphites.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A critical challenge for the application of graphite is low strength, which originates from the easy cleavage of graphite (0002) planes. Inspired by the burl strengthening mechanism observed in tree trunks, nanodiamond particles converted into graphite onions are used as &#8220;nanoburls&#8221; embedded in graphite (0002) lattice planes to eliminate the graphite (0002) plane cleavage of bulk graphites prepared by spark plasma sintering from graphite powders. Covalent bonds are built between carbon atoms by sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hybridization at the interface between the graphite onions and flakes, which triggers an electron redistribution to form positive/negative charge domains within. Thus, pairs of pseudo&#8208;Schottky junctions are created by the hybridization, which further enhances the bonding between the graphite onions and flakes. With these bonding mechanisms, and with voids between the graphite powders filled in by the volume expansion associated with the change of nanodiamonds to the graphite onions, the loose compaction of graphite powder becomes consolidated at 1700&#160;&#176;C. The proposed nanoburl mechanism shows its potential and bestows the nanoburl graphites with strength five times that of conventional graphites prepared from graphite powders. The concept of nanoburl strengthening can be important in the microstructural design and property enhancement of other layered materials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Biologically Excretable Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Dots for Visualizing Through the Marmosets Intravitally: Horizons in Future Clinical Nanomedicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 17, April 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The long aliphatic chains of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;gens are conducive to the excretion of AIE dots from an animal's body. The deep micro cerebrovasculature in marmosets is visualized through the thinned skull. Non&#8208;invasive and high&#8208;spatial&#8208;frequency near&#8208;infrared&#8208;IIb imaging is utilized in non&#8208;human primates. It is believed this work provides crucial ideas to advance the development of biosafe AIE dots and future nanomedicine.








Abstract
Superb reliability and biocompatibility equip aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) dots with tremendous potential for fluorescence bioimaging. However, there is still a chronic lack of design instructions of excretable and bright AIE emitters. Here, a kind of PEGylated AIE (OTPA&#8208;BBT) dots with strong absorption and extremely high second near&#8208;infrared region (NIR&#8208;II) PLQY of 13.6% is designed, and a long&#8208;aliphatic&#8208;chain design blueprint contributing to their excretion from an animal's body is proposed. Assisted by the OTPA&#8208;BBT dots with bright fluorescence beyond 1100&#160;nm and even 1500&#160;nm (NIR&#8208;IIb), large&#8208;depth cerebral vasculature (beyond 600&#160;&#181;m) as well as real&#8208;time blood flow are monitored through a thinned skull, and noninvasive NIR&#8208;IIb imaging with rich high&#8208;spatial&#8208;frequency information gives a precise presentation of gastrointestinal tract in marmosets. Importantly, after intravenous or oral administration, the definite excretion of OTPA&#8208;BBT dots from the body is demonstrated, which provides influential evidence of biosafety.

         <title>Spatial Control of Probiotic Bacteria in the Gastrointestinal Tract Assisted by Magnetic Particles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 17, April 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A powerful yet simple new approach for controlling the spatial distribution of probiotic bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract using a composite biomagnetic material is presented. This approach enhances the retention and persistence of orally administered probiotics in the small intestine of mice, which has broader applications for advancing studies of the gut microbiome and the development of probiotic therapies.








Abstract
Engineered probiotics have the potential to diagnose and treat a variety of gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. However, these exogenous bacterial agents have limited ability to effectively colonize specific regions of the GI tract due to a lack of external control over their localization and persistence. Magnetic fields are well suited to providing such control, since they freely penetrate biological tissues. However, they are difficult to apply with sufficient strength to directly manipulate magnetically labeled cells in deep tissue such as the GI tract. Here, it is demonstrated that a composite biomagnetic material consisting of microscale magnetic particles and probiotic bacteria, when orally administered and combined with an externally applied magnetic field, enables the trapping and retention of probiotic bacteria within the GI tract of mice. This technology improves the ability of these probiotic agents to accumulate at specific locations and stably colonize without antibiotic treatment. By enhancing the ability of GI&#8208;targeted probiotics to be at the right place at the right time, cellular localization assisted by magnetic particles (CLAMP) adds external physical control to an important emerging class of microbial theranostics.

         <title>Manipulating Nonlinear Optical Response via Domain Control in Nanocrystal&#8208;in&#8208;Glass Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 17, April 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of manipulating nonlinear optical response via domain control in nanocrystal&#8208;in&#8208;glass (NIG) composite is proposed. An unusual nonlinear light&#8211;matter interaction transverse second&#8208;harmonic generation is observed in NIG composite with specific domain structure. The constructed NIG composite is further demonstrated for precise measurement of the group velocity and duration of ultrashort optical pulse.








Abstract
Nanocrystal&#8208;in&#8208;glass (NIG) is an exciting class of composites, because it can not only combine the advantages of crystal and glass materials but also potentially generate new physical phenomenon in a cooperative manner. Herein, the nonlinear light&#8211;matter interaction processes in a broad range of NIG composites homogeneously embedded with LiNbO3 are investigated. It is shown that, by rational control of the organization manner of crystal and glass phases, second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) can be precisely tuned. Importantly, an unusual SHG phenomenon, transverse SHG (TSHG), can be realized in the special region of the microstructure map combined with the features of high loading, nanoscale size, and homogenous distribution of nanocrystals. Furthermore, NIG composites exhibit broadband optical response, allowing TSHG in a wide waveband region to be achieved. Based on the above effects, the applications of the constructed NIG composite for precise measurement of the group velocity and duration of ultrashort optical pulses with femtosecond time scales are demonstrated. Indeed, the findings outline a fundamental principle to design NIG configurations for creating new properties, providing new directions for expanding the scope of NIG functional materials.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Electrically Enhanced Intracellular Catalysis of FePt&#8208;FeC Heterostructures for Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 17, April 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a weak alternating magnetic field, the induced charges gathered at the interface of FePt&#8208;FeC heterostructures are demonstrated to promote intracellular catalytic reduction of &#946;&#8208;nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, leading to tumor cell senescence, thereby reducing resistance to treatments such as Fenton reaction&#8208;based chemodynamic therapy. A one&#8211;two punch strategy is proposed and shows good therapeutic effects on tumors.








Abstract
Intracellular catalytic reactions can tailor tumor cell plasticity toward high&#8208;efficiency treatments, but the application is hindered by the low efficiency of intracellular catalysis. Here, a magneto&#8208;electronic approach is developed for efficient intracellular catalysis by inducing eddy currents of FePt&#8208;FeC heterostructures in mild alternating magnetic fields (frequency of f&#160;= 96&#160;kHz and amplitude of B&#160;&#8804; 70 mT). Finite element simulation shows a high density of induced charges gathering at the interface of FePt&#8208;FeC heterostructure in the alternating magnetic field. As a result, the concentration of an essential coenzyme&#8212;&#946;&#8208;nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide&#8212;in cancer cells is significantly reduced by the enhanced catalytic hydrogenation reaction of FePt&#8208;FeC heterostructures under alternating magnetic stimulation, leading to over 80% of senescent cancer cells&#8212;a vulnerable phenotype that facilitates further treatment. It is further demonstrated that senescent cancer cells can be efficiently killed by the chemodynamic therapy based on the enhanced Fenton&#8208;like reaction. By promoting intracellular catalytic reactions in tumors, this approach may enable precise catalytic tumor treatment.

         <title>The Electrostatic Attraction and Catalytic Effect Enabled by Ionic&#8211;Covalent Organic Nanosheets on MXene for Separator Modification of Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 17, April 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modification of the separator of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, based on the electrostatic attraction and catalytic effect of polysulfides is presented by way of guanidinium&#8208;based ionic&#8211;covalent organic nanosheets on the surface of conductive Ti3C2. The modified separator endows carbon nanotube/sulfur electrodes with significantly enhanced reversible capacity, areal capacity, volumetric capacity, and cycling stability.








Abstract
It is of great significance to mediate the redox kinetics and shuttle effect of polysulfides in pursuit of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and long&#8208;life lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Herein, a new strategy is proposed based on the electrostatic attraction and catalytic effect of polysulfides for the modification of the polypropylene (PP) separator. Guanidinium&#8208;based ionic&#8211;covalent organic nanosheets (iCON) on the surface of Ti3C2 is presented as a coating layer for the PP separator. The synergetic effects of Ti3C2 and iCON provide new platforms to suppress the shuttle effect of polysulfides, expedite the redox kinetics of sulfur species, and promote efficient conversion of the intercepted polysulfides. The functional separator endows carbon nanotube/sulfur cathodes with excellent electrochemical performance. The average capacity decay per cycle within 2000 cycles at 2 C is as low as 0.006%. The separator is even effective in the case of sulfur content of 90 wt% and sulfur loading of 7.6 mg cm&#8722;2; the reversible capacity, areal capacity, and volumetric capacity at 0.1 C are as high as 1186 mA h g&#8722;1, 9.01 mA h cm&#8722;2, and 1201 mA h cm&#8722;3, respectively. This work provides a promising approach toward separator modification for the development of high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Engineering Band&#8208;Type Alignment in CsPbBr3 Perovskite&#8208;Based Artificial Multiple Quantum Wells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 17, April 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering band&#8208;type alignment in CsPbBr3 multiple quantum wells (MQWs) is demonstrated by adapting various organic molecular spacers as quantum barriers. Three different MQWs exhibit a different band offset with CsPbBr3, resulting in a variety of MQW band alignments, e.g., type&#8208;I or type&#8208;II structures. Photodetectors using these MQWs display distinct carrier dynamics and device characteristics that vary distinctly the barrier material.








Abstract
Semiconductor heterostructures of multiple quantum wells (MQWs) have major applications in optoelectronics. However, for halide perovskites&#8212;the leading class of emerging semiconductors&#8212;building a variety of bandgap alignments (i.e., band&#8208;types) in MQWs is not yet realized owing to the limitations of the current set of used barrier materials. Here, artificial perovskite&#8208;based MQWs using 2,2&#8242;,2&#8243;&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;benzinetriyl)&#8208;tris(1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;H&#8208;benzimidazole), tris&#8208;(8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline)aluminum, and 2,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4,7&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline as quantum barrier materials are introduced. The structures of three different five&#8208;stacked perovskite&#8208;based MQWs each exhibiting a different band offset with CsPbBr3 in the conduction and valence bands, resulting in a variety of MQW band alignments, i.e., type&#8208;I or type&#8208;II structures, are shown. Transient absorption spectroscopy reveals the disparity in charge carrier dynamics between type&#8208;I and type&#8208;II MQWs. Photodiodes of each type of perovskite artificial MQWs show entirely different carrier behaviors and photoresponse characteristics. Compared with bulk perovskite devices, type&#8208;II MQW photodiodes demonstrate a more than tenfold increase in the rectification ratio. The findings open new opportunities for producing halide&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based quantum devices by bandgap engineering using simple quantum barrier considerations.

         <title>Van Der Waals Epitaxial Growth and Phase Transition of Layered FeSe2 Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 17, April 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel and phase&#8208;pure layered iron diselenide (FeSe2) nanocrystals, confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction and atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, are epitaxially grown on mica by sublimed&#8208;salt&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition. They exhibit metallic behavior with high electrical conductivity and a phase transition at &#8776;11 K.








Abstract
Layered iron chalcogenides (FeX, X = S, Se, Te) provide excellent platforms to study intertwined phase transitions, superconductivity, and magnetism. However, layered iron dichalcogenides (FeX2, X = S, Se, Te) are rarely reported and their intrinsic properties are still unknown. Here, phase&#8208;pure layered iron diselenide (FeSe2) nanocrystals are epitaxially grown on mica by the sublimed&#8208;salt&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition method at atmospheric pressure. The layered atomic structure of FeSe2 is confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction and atomic&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy. Electrical transport shows that the layered FeSe2 is a metal with high conductivity and a phase transition at &#8776;11 K. The phase transition manifests itself as a kink in the temperature&#8208;dependent resistivity, as well as anomalous magnetoresistance (MR) appearing around the phase&#8208;transition temperature. The MR changes from negative to positive, accompanied by large hysteresis near the phase&#8208;transition temperature upon cooling. The negative MR and hysteresis might originate from magnetic field suppression scattering of spin fluctuations and competition of magnetic interactions induced by the phase transition, respectively. Layered iron dichalcogenide will be potential candidate to explore novel quantum phenomena and other applications.

         <title>Smart Doppler Cloak Operating in Broad Band and Full Polarizations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 17, April 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept and realization of a &#8220;smart Doppler cloak&#8221; for a self&#8208;adaptive anti&#8208;Doppler shift is demonstrated. The smart Doppler cloak is implemented by integrating a broadband and full&#8208;polarization time&#8208;modulated metasurface with a velocity&#8208;sensor&#8208;based intelligent control system, which can cancel automatically different Doppler shifts by sensing the variant velocities without the aid of human beings, as if it possessed a chameleon's ability.








Abstract
Invisibility cloaks, a class of attractive devices that can hide objects from external observers, have become practical reality owing to the advent of metamaterials. In previous cloaking schemes, almost all demonstrated cloaks are time&#8208;invariant and are investigated in the system that is motionless, and hence they are limited to hide stationary objects. In addition, the current cloaks are typically static or require manual operation to achieve dynamic cloaking. Here, a smart Doppler cloak operating in broadband and full polarizations is reported, which consists of a time&#8208;modulated reflective metasurface and a sensing&#8208;feedback time&#8208;varying electronic control system. Experimental results show that the smart Doppler cloak is able to respond self&#8208;adaptively and rapidly to the ever&#8208;changing velocity of moving objects and then cancel different Doppler shifts in real time, without any human intervention. Moreover, the wideband and polarization&#8208;insensitive features enable the cloak to be more robust and practical. To illustrate the capabilities of the proposed approach, the smart Doppler cloak is measured in three scenarios with two different groups of linearly&#8208;polarized incidences at 3.3 and 4.9&#160;GHz, and one group circularly&#8208;polarized incidences at 6.0&#160;GHz, respectively.

         <title>Fermi Velocity Reduction of Dirac Fermions around the Brillouin Zone Center in In2Se3&#8211;Bilayer Graphene Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 17, April 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical strategy to construct moir&#233; Dirac cones around the Brillouin zone center is realized by folding graphene Dirac cones in monolayer In2Se3/bilayer graphene heterostructures. The Fermi velocity of the moir&#233; Dirac cones is reduced by &#8776;23%, and the reshaped Dirac point at the &#915; point is elongated. Both features further confirm the moir&#233; Dirac fermion renormalization and interactions.








Abstract
Emergent phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity, Mott&#8208;like insulators, and the peculiar quantum Hall effect in graphene&#8208;based heterostructures are proposed to stem from the superlattice&#8208;induced renormalization of (moir&#233;) Dirac fermions at the graphene Brillouin zone corners. Understanding the corresponding band structure commonly demands photoemission spectroscopy with both sub&#8208;meV resolution and large&#8208;momentum coverage, beyond the capability of the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. Here the realization of moir&#233; Dirac cones around the Brillouin zone center in monolayer In2Se3/bilayer graphene heterostructure is reported. The renormalization is evidenced by reduced Fermi velocity (&#8776;23%) of the moir&#233; Dirac cones and the reshaped Dirac point at the &#915; point where they intersect. While there have been many theoretical predictions and much indirect experimental evidence, the findings here are the first direct observation of Fermi velocity reduction of the moir&#233; Dirac cones. These features suggest strong In2Se3/graphene interlayer coupling, which is comparable with that in twisted bilayer graphene. The strategy expands the choice of materials in the heterostructure design and stimulates subsequent broad investigations of emergent physics at the sub&#8208;meV energy scale.

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Dependent Circular Photogalvanic Effect in Enantiomorphic 2D Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 17, April 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chirality dependence of a novel optoelectronic phenomenon, circular photogalvanic effect, is observed in a pair of 2D organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites with introduced chiral molecules. The sign reversal of zero&#8208;bias photocurrents between enantiomers indicates the chirality&#8208;dependent spin&#8208;polarized bands induced by spin&#8211;orbit coupling.








Abstract
The control of the optoelectronic properties of 2D organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite (2D&#8208;OIHP) lead halides is an increasingly prevalent topic. Herein, the observation of the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) in new enantiomorphic 2D&#8208;OIHP lead iodides is reported, which are synthesized as a first OIHP&#8208;related system belonging to a chiral space group by incorporating organic chiral cations into the inorganic layers of lead iodides. The CPGE is an optoelectronic phenomenon associated with the spin&#8211;orbit coupling of heavy atoms in noncentrosymmetric systems. Owing to the CPGE, light&#8208;helicity&#8208;dependent steady photocurrents are generated without an external bias voltage under the irradiation of circularly polarized light. Furthermore, the sign reversal of the CPGE photocurrent depending on the chirality of the designed 2D&#8208;OIHP lead iodides is observed. This result indicates formation of the theoretically predicted radial spin&#8208;polarized texture in k&#8208;space of chiral systems owing to spin&#8208;momentum locking. Hence, chiral 2D&#8208;OIHP lead halides can be a promising platform for engineering opto&#8208;spintronic functionalities.

         <title>A Hippocampus&#8208;Inspired Dual&#8208;Gated Organic Artificial Synapse for Simultaneous Sensing of a Neurotransmitter and Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 17, April 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hippocampal&#8208;synapse&#8208;inspired organic artificial synapse that can simultaneously detect a neurotransmitter and light is prepared using a dual&#8208;gate organic synaptic transistor with a functionalized extended&#8208;gate electrode. In addition to mimicking typical synaptic functions such as short&#8208; and long&#8208;term potentiation and synaptic weight control, hippocampal synaptic strengthening effects in response to repetitive dopamine injection and light illumination are emulated.








Abstract
Organic neuromorphic devices and sensors that mimic the functions of chemical synapses and sensory perception in humans have received much attention for next&#8208;generation computing and integrated logic circuits. Despite recent advances, organic artificial synapses capable of detecting both neurotransmitters in liquid environments and light are not reported. Herein, inspired by hippocampal synapses, a dual&#8208;gate organic synaptic transistor platform with a photoconductive polymer semiconductor, a ferroelectric insulator of P(VDF&#8208;TrFE), and an extended&#8208;gate electrode functionalized with boronic acid is developed to simultaneously detect the neurotransmitter dopamine and light. The developed synaptic transistor enables memory consolidation upon repetitive exposure to dopamine and polychromatic light, exhibiting effectively modulated postsynaptic currents. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept hippocampal&#8208;synapse&#8208;mimetic organic neuromorphic system combining a chemical sensor and a photosensor opens new possibilities for developing low&#8208;power organic artificial synaptic multisensors and light&#8208;induced memory consolidative artificial synapses, and can also contribute to the development of human&#8211;machine interfaces.

         <title>Target Reprogramming Lysosomes of CD8+ T Cells by a Mineralized Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 17, April 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lysosome&#8208;targeted drug&#8208;loaded nanoparticles (LYS&#8208;NPs) composed of CD63&#8208;aptamers coupled with mineralized metal&#8211;organic frameworks are developed. Using the degradation of the LYS&#8208;NPs in lysosomes, therapeutic proteins and Ca2+ are stored in the lysosomes of T cells. Next, they are released when the T cell receptor (TCR) of the T cells binds to tumor cells. These elements possess a powerful ability for cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
T cell immunotherapy holds significant challenges in solid tumors, mainly due to the T cells&#8217; low activation and the decreased synthesis&#8211;release of therapeutic proteins, including perforin and granzyme B, which are present in lysosomes. In this study, a lysosome&#8208;targeting nanoparticle (LYS&#8208;NP) is developed by way of a mineralized metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) coupled with a lysosome&#8208;targeting aptamer (CD63&#8208;aptamer) to enhance the antitumor effect of T cells. The MOF synthesized from Zn2+ and dimethylimidazole has good protein encapsulation and acid sensitivity, and is thus an ideal lysosomal delivery vector. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) is used to induce MOF mineralization, improve the composite material's stability in encapsulating therapeutic protein, and provide calcium ions with synergistic effects. Before mineralization, perforin and granzyme B&#8212;T cell&#8208;needed therapeutic proteins for tumors&#8212;are preloaded with the MOF. Moreover, T cells are pretreated with processed tumor&#8208;specific antigens to activate or produce memory before reprogramming the lysosomes, facilitating the T cell receptor (TCR) for release of the therapeutic proteins. Using T cells recombined by LYS&#8208;NPs, a significant enhancement of breast cancer control is confirmed.

A family of degradable tough adhesive hydrogels containing &#8776;90% water is engineered by incorporating covalently networked degradable crosslinkers and hydrolyzable ionically crosslinked main&#8208;chain polymers. Mechanical toughness, adhesion, and degradation of these formulations are tested in accelerated in vitro conditions and to 4 months in vivo. The broad versatility of these adhesives provides the foundation for many in vivo indications.








The development of tough adhesive hydrogels has enabled unprecedented adhesion to wet and moving tissue surfaces throughout the body, but they are typically composed of nondegradable components. Here, a family of degradable tough adhesive hydrogels containing &#8776;90% water by incorporating covalently networked degradable crosslinkers and hydrolyzable ionically crosslinked main&#8208;chain polymers is developed. Mechanical toughness, adhesion, and degradation of these new formulations are tested in both accelerated in vitro conditions and up to 16 weeks in vivo. These degradable tough adhesives are engineered with equivalent mechanical and adhesive properties to nondegradable tough adhesives, capable of achieving stretches &gt;20 times their initial length, fracture energies &gt;6&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;2,&#160;and&#160;adhesion&#160;energies &gt;1000&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2.&#160;All degradable systems show complete degradation within 2 weeks under accelerated aging conditions in vitro and weeks to months in vivo depending on the degradable crosslinker selected. Excellent biocompatibility is observed for all groups after 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 weeks of implantation, with minimal fibrous encapsulation and no signs of organ toxicity. On&#8208;demand removal of the adhesive is achieved with treatment of chemical agents which do not cause damage to underlying skin tissue in mice. The broad versatility of this family of adhesives provides the foundation for numerous in vivo indications.

         <title>Tunable Stochasticity in an Artificial Spin Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 17, April 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The motion of magnetic domain&#8208;walls within artificial spin networks leads to a tunable stochastic response of the metamaterial, which can be tailored through an external field and local lattice modifications. This type of tunable stochastic network can produce a controllable random response, as demonstrated by recreating a nanoscale version of the Galton board, the iconic experiment historically used to showcase the emergence of order from chaos.








Abstract
Metamaterials present the possibility of artificially generating advanced functionalities through engineering of their internal structure. Artificial spin networks, in which a large number of nanoscale magnetic elements are coupled together, are promising metamaterial candidates that enable the control of collective magnetic behavior through tuning of the local interaction between elements. In this work, the motion of magnetic domain&#8208;walls in an artificial spin network leads to a tunable stochastic response of the metamaterial, which can be tailored through an external magnetic field and local lattice modifications. This type of tunable stochastic network produces a controllable random response exploiting intrinsic stochasticity within magnetic domain&#8208;wall motion at the nanoscale. An iconic demonstration used to illustrate the control of randomness is the Galton board. In this system, multiple balls fall into an array of pegs to generate a bell&#8208;shaped curve that can be modified via the array spacing or the tilt of the board. A&#160;nanoscale recreation of this experiment using an artificial spin network is employed to demonstrate tunable stochasticity. This type of tunable stochastic network opens new paths toward post&#8208;Von Neumann computing architectures such as Bayesian sensing or random neural networks, in which stochasticity is harnessed to efficiently perform complex computational tasks.

         <title>Ultralow Lattice Thermal Conductivity and Superhigh Thermoelectric Figure&#8208;of&#8208;Merit in (Mg, Bi) Co&#8208;Doped GeTe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 17, April 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via using large mass and strain field fluctuations as indicators for low lattice thermal conductivity, the combination of (Mg, Bi) is screened as effective dopants in GeTe. As a result of the optimized carrier concentration, increased band convergence, and lowered lattice thermal conductivity, Ge0.9Mg0.04Bi0.06Te shows a superhigh zT of &#8776;2.5 at 700 K.








Abstract
High&#8208;efficiency thermoelectric (TE) technology is determined by the performance of TE materials. Doping is a routine approach in TEs to achieve optimized electrical properties and lowered thermal conductivity. However, how to choose appropriate dopants with desirable solution content to realize high TE figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit (zT) is very tough work. In this study, via the use of large mass and strain field fluctuations as indicators for low lattice thermal conductivity, the combination of (Mg, Bi) in GeTe is screened as very effective dopants for potentially high zTs. In experiments, a series of (Mg, Bi) co&#8208;doped GeTe compounds are prepared and the electrical and thermal transport properties are systematically investigated. Ultralow lattice thermal conductivity, about 0.3 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at 600 K, is obtained in Ge0.9Mg0.04Bi0.06Te due to the introduced large mass and strain field fluctuations by (Mg, Bi) co&#8208;doping. In addition, (Mg, Bi) co&#8208;doping can introduce extra electrons for optimal carrier concentration and diminish the energy offset at the top of the valence band for high density&#8208;of&#8208;states effective mass. Via these synthetic effects, a superhigh zT of &#8776;2.5 at 700 K is achieved for Ge0.9Mg0.04Bi0.06Te. This study sheds light on the rational design of effective dopants in other TE materials.

         <title>Tip&#8208;Induced Nano&#8208;Engineering of Strain, Bandgap, and Exciton Funneling in 2D Semiconductors</title>

         <dc:description>
A dynamic nanomechanical strain&#8208;engineering of naturally formed wrinkles in a WSe2 monolayer, with real&#8208;time investigation of nano&#8208;spectroscopic properties is demonstrated using hyperspectral adaptive tip&#8208;enhanced PL (a&#8208;TEPL) spectroscopy with &lt;15 nm spatial resolution. This nanomechanical strain&#8208;engineering allows tuning of the exciton dynamics and emission properties at the nanoscale. Furthermore, a systematic switching and modulation platform of the wrinkle emission is demonstrated.








Abstract
The tunability of the bandgap, absorption and emission energies, photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield, exciton transport, and energy transfer in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers provides a new class of functions for a wide range of ultrathin photonic devices. Recent strain&#8208;engineering approaches have enabled to tune some of these properties, yet dynamic control at the nanoscale with real&#8208;time and &#8208;space characterizations remains a challenge. Here, a dynamic nano&#8208;mechanical strain&#8208;engineering of naturally&#8208;formed wrinkles in a WSe2 monolayer, with real&#8208;time investigation of nano&#8208;spectroscopic properties is demonstrated using hyperspectral adaptive tip&#8208;enhanced PL (a&#8208;TEPL) spectroscopy. First, nanoscale wrinkles are characterized through hyperspectral a&#8208;TEPL nano&#8208;imaging with &lt;15 nm spatial resolution, which reveals the modified nano&#8208;excitonic properties by the induced tensile strain at the wrinkle apex, for example, an increase in the quantum yield due to the exciton funneling, decrease in PL energy up to &#8776;10 meV, and a symmetry change in the TEPL spectra caused by the reconfigured electronic bandstructure. Then the local strain is dynamically engineered by pressing and releasing the wrinkle apex through an atomic force tip control. This nano&#8208;mechanical strain&#8208;engineering allows to tune the exciton dynamics and emission properties at the nanoscale in a reversible fashion. In addition, a systematic switching and modulation platform of the wrinkle emission is demonstrated, which provides a new strategy for robust, tunable, and ultracompact nano&#8208;optical sources in atomically thin&#160;semiconductors.

         <title>Intrinsically Polar Piezoelectric Self&#8208;Assembled Oligopeptide Monolayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 17, April 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel, intrinsically polar&#8208;oligopeptide&#8208;based piezoelectric force and touch sensors producing large piezoelectric voltage response are presented. They are easily manufactured through solution processing, without the need for electrical poling. The devices exhibit immense piezoelectric voltage constants (g33) up to 2&#160;V m N&#8722;1 and a flexible device prototype is demonstrated that produces open&#8208;circuit voltages of nearly 6&#160;V under gentle bending motion.








Abstract
Flexible, biocompatible piezoelectric materials are of considerable research interest for a variety of applications, but many suffer from low response or high cost to manufacture. Herein, novel piezoelectric force and touch sensors based on self&#8208;assembled monolayers of oligopeptides are presented, which produce large piezoelectric voltage response and are easily manufactured without the need for electrical poling. While the devices generate modest piezoelectric charge constants (d33) of up to 9.8&#160;pC N&#8722;1, they exhibit immense piezoelectric voltage constants (g33) up to 2&#160;V m N&#8722;1. Furthermore, a flexible device prototype is demonstrated that produces open&#8208;circuit voltages of nearly 6&#160;V under gentle bending motion. Improvements in peptide selection and device construction promise to further improve the already outstanding voltage response and open the door to numerous practical&#160;applications.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Assisted Kinetic Trapping in Quaternary Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 17, April 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel kinetic&#8208;trapping method that is compatible with solution&#8208;processing is presented. The method is demonstrated by fabricating an ultraviolet&#8208;emitting perovskite alloy: Cs1&#8722;xRbxPbCl3. The method involves heating a precursor solution to provide it with sufficient thermal energy to form the alloy state. The method yields a material with superior stability and optical properties compared to simple precursor mixing.








Abstract
Engineering halide perovskites through alloying allows synthesis of materials having tuned electronic and optical properties; however, synthesizing many of these alloys is hindered by the formation of demixed phases arising due to thermodynamically unstable crystal structures. Methods have been developed to make such alloys, such as solid&#8208;phase reactions, chemical vapor deposition, and mechanical grinding; but these are incompatible with low&#8208;temperature solution&#8208;processing and monolithic integration, precluding a number of important applications of these materials. Here, solvent&#8208;phase kinetic trapping (SPKT), an approach that enables the synthesis of novel thermodynamically unfavored perovskite alloys, is developed. SPKT is used to synthesize Cs1&#8722;xRbxPbCl3 and report the first instance of ultraviolet emission in polycrystalline perovskite thin films. SPKT leads to materials exhibiting superior thermal and photostability compared to non&#8208;kinetically trapped materials of the same precursors. Transient absorption spectroscopy of the kinetically trapped material reveals improved optical properties: greater absorption, and longer ground&#8208;state bleach lifetimes. SPKT may be applied to other perovskites to realize improved material properties while benefiting from facile solution&#8208;processing.

         <title>A Tensile&#8208;Strained Pt&#8211;Rh Single&#8208;Atom Alloy Remarkably Boosts Ethanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 17, April 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolated Rh atoms on intermetallic PtBi matrix are achieved by atomic galvanic replacement, and the system transforms into a tensile&#8208;strained Pt&#8211;Rh single&#8208;atom alloy via electrochemical dealloying. Benefiting from the Rh1&#8208;tailored Pt (110) surface with tensile strain, the PtBi@PtRh1 nanoplates exhibit record&#8208;high and all&#8208;round superior electrocatalytic performances including activity, selectivity, stability, and anti&#8208;poisoning ability toward ethanol oxidation in an alkaline electrolyte.








Abstract
The rational design and control of electrocatalysts at single&#8208;atomic sites could enable unprecedented atomic utilization and catalytic properties, yet it remains challenging in multimetallic alloys. Herein, the first example of isolated Rh atoms on ordered PtBi nanoplates (PtBi&#8208;Rh1) by atomic galvanic replacement, and their subsequent transformation into a tensile&#8208;strained Pt&#8211;Rh single&#8208;atom alloy (PtBi@PtRh1) via electrochemical dealloying are presented. Benefiting from the Rh1&#8208;tailored Pt (110) surface with tensile strain, the PtBi@PtRh1 nanoplates exhibit record&#8208;high and all&#8208;round superior electrocatalytic performance including activity, selectivity, stability, and anti&#8208;poisoning ability toward ethanol oxidation in alkaline electrolytes. Density functional theory calculations reveal the synergism between effective Rh1 and tensile strain in boosting the adsorption of ethanol and key surface intermediates and the C&#63743;C bond cleavage of the intermediates. The facile synthesis of the tensile&#8208;strained single&#8208;atom alloy provides a novel strategy to construct model nanostructures, accelerating the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts.

         <title>Biomagnetic Materials: Spatial Control of Probiotic Bacteria in the Gastrointestinal Tract Assisted by Magnetic Particles (Adv. Mater. 17/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 17, April 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacterial agents engineered to diagnose or treat gastrointestinal (GI) diseases have limited ability to colonize specific regions of the GI tract. In article number 2007473, Mikhail G. Shapiro and co&#8208;workers show that a composite biomagnetic material comprising microscale magnetic particles and probiotic bacteria can be used, in conjunction with external magnets, to improve the bacterial agents' ability to localize and colonize inside the gut.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 17, April 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thin films of crystalline porous materials have great potential in membranes, sensors, and microelectronics. Still, characterizing their pore size, pore volume, and specific surface area is challenging. In article number 2006993, Rob Ameloot and co&#8208;workers discuss positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy, represented by the bees lighting up inside the honeycomb, in comparison to physisorption methods, symbolized by the quantification of honey in the pores.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 17, April 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of manipulating nonlinear optical responses via domain control in a nanocrystal&#8208;in&#8208;glass (NIG) composite is proposed by Huakang Yu, Shifeng Zhou, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2006482. Significantly, unusual nonlinear light&#8211;matter interactions, transverse second&#8208;harmonic generation can be observed in the NIG composite with a specific domain configuration, which can work as an ultrafast clock for the measurement of ultrashort optical pulse duration.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 17, April 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2007503, Zhenyu Wang, Jianfeng Wang, Chaoyu Chen, and co&#8208;workers develop a practical strategy to construct moir&#233; Dirac cones around the Brillouin zone center by folding graphene Dirac cones in monolayer In2Se3/bilayer graphene heterostructures. The Fermi velocity of the moir&#233; Dirac cones is reduced by &#8776;23%, and the reshaped Dirac point at the &#915; point is elongated. Both features further confirm moir&#233; Dirac fermion renormalization and interactions.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 17, April 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent pivotal advancements in designing nanoarchitectures based on metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) for efficient electrochemical water splitting are presented. The chemical composition and structure functionalization at the atomic and molecular levels are discussed; then, the catalytic activities, identification of active sites, fundamental mechanisms, and commercialization are summarized. Finally, a comprehensive commentary on the current primary challenges and future perspectives is provided.








Abstract
Electrochemical water splitting has attracted significant attention as a key pathway for the development of renewable energy systems. Fabricating efficient electrocatalysts for these processes is intensely desired to reduce their overpotentials and facilitate practical applications. Recently, metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanoarchitectures featuring ultrahigh surface areas, tunable nanostructures, and excellent porosities have emerged as promising materials for the development of highly active catalysts for electrochemical water splitting. Herein, the most pivotal advances in recent research on engineering MOF nanoarchitectures for efficient electrochemical water splitting are presented. First, the design of catalytic centers for MOF&#8208;based/derived electrocatalysts is summarized and compared from the aspects of chemical composition optimization and structural functionalization at the atomic and molecular levels. Subsequently, the fast&#8208;growing breakthroughs in catalytic activities, identification of highly active sites, and fundamental mechanisms are thoroughly discussed. Finally, a comprehensive commentary on the current primary challenges and future perspectives in water splitting and its commercialization for hydrogen production is provided. Hereby, new insights into the synthetic principles and electrocatalysis for designing MOF nanoarchitectures for the practical utilization of water splitting are offered, thus further promoting their future prosperity for a wide range of applications.

Abstract
In the new era of the Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things, athletic big data collection and analysis based on widely distributed sensing networks are particularly important in the development of intelligent sports. Conventional sensors usually require an external power supply, with limitations such as limited lifetime and high maintenance cost. As a newly developed mechanical energy harvesting and self&#8208;powered sensing technology, the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) shows great potential to overcome these limitations. Most importantly, TENGs can be fabricated using wood, paper, fibers, and polymers, which are the most frequently used materials for sports. Recent progress on the development of TENGs for the field of intelligent sports is summarized. First, the working mechanism of TENG and its association with athletic big data are introduced. Subsequently, the development of TENG&#8208;based sports sensing systems, including smart sports facilities and wearable equipment is highlighted. At last, the remaining challenges and open opportunities are also discussed.

         <title>Engineering Nanostructure&#8211;Interface of Photoanode Materials Toward Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 17, April 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) photoanode materials with better optical response and surface/interface carrier transport/injection performance can allow more efficient PEC water oxidation. Various strategies for improving the PEC water oxidation performance from the perspective of nanostructure&#8211;interface engineering are summarized and the relationship between nanostructure&#8211;interface engineering and the optical&#8208;response, surface/interfacial carrier transport/injection processes of photoanode materials are discussed.








Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation based on semiconductor materials plays an important role in the production of clean fuel and value&#8208;added chemicals. Nanostructure&#8211;interface engineering has proven to be an effective way to construct highly efficient PEC water oxidation photoanodes with good light capture, carrier transport, and water oxidation kinetics. However, from theoretical and application perspectives, the relationship between the nanostructure and interface of photoanode materials and their PEC performance remains unclear. In this review, the PEC water oxidation reaction mechanism and evaluation criteria are briefly presented. The theoretical basis and research status of the nanostructure&#8211;interface engineering on constructing high&#8208;performance PEC water oxidation photoanodes are summarized and discussed. Finally, the current challenges and the future opportunities of nanostructure&#8211;interface engineering for the PEC reactions are pointed out.

         <title>Porosimetry for Thin Films of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: A Comparison of Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy and Adsorption&#8208;Based Methods</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 17, April 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The porosity characterization of metal&#8211;organic frameworks deposited as thin films on surfaces is challenging and requires a combination of techniques. The use of positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy is introduced, and it is compared in a comprehensive and tutorial way to conventional adsorption&#8208;based methods (quartz crystal microbalance gravimetry, ellipsometric porosimetry, and krypton physisorption).








Abstract
Thin films of crystalline and porous metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have great potential in membranes, sensors, and microelectronic chips. While the morphology and crystallinity of MOF films can be evaluated using widely available techniques, characterizing their pore size, pore volume, and specific surface area is challenging due to the low amount of material and substrate effects. Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) is introduced as a powerful method to obtain pore size information and depth profiling in MOF films. The complementarity of this approach to established physisorption&#8208;based methods such as quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) gravimetry, ellipsometric porosimetry (EP), and Kr physisorption (KrP) is illustrated. This comprehensive discussion on MOF thin film porosimetry is supported by experimental data for thin films of ZIF&#8208;8.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nanometer Nanobelts Based on Titanium Dioxide/Zirconium Dioxide&#8211;Polyoxometalate Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZrO2&#8211;PMoO (PMZ) sub&#8208;nanobelts (SNBs) and TiO2&#8211;PMoO (PMT) SNBs are constructed through a nanoclusters gathering&#8211;transforming process, composed of ZrO2/TiO2 and polyoxometalate (POM) nanoclusters, showing high catalytic activity and stability in the oxidative desulfurization reaction at room temperature. The POM nanoclusters not only facilitate the formation of SNBs, but also perform as catalytic centers.








Abstract
In addition to offering conformational flexibility, sub&#8208;nanometer nanobelts (SNBs) also outperform many larger nanobelts with large size owing to their ultrathin morphologies. However, to date, only a few monocomponent SNBs have been synthesized. This study presents a facile method for synthesizing ZrO2&#8211;PMoO (PMZ) SNBs and TiO2&#8211;PMoO (PMT) SNBs with heterostructures. The SNBs comprise ZrO2/TiO2 and polyoxometalate (POM) nanoclusters, which are formed via the aggregation and subsequent transformation of nanoclusters. Significantly, these SNBs demonstrate high catalytic activity and stability in oxidative desulfurization reactions at room temperature. The impressive catalytic performance of the SNBs is aided by the POM nanoclusters, which not only coassemble with ZrO2/TiO2 nuclei to form building blocks of PMZ SNBs/PMT SNBs but also serve as catalytic centers. The catalytic performance is further enhanced by the ZrO2/TiO2 in the SNBs. Moreover, the proposed synthesis method can be utilized to produce other SNBs. Thus, this method provides valuable insights into the strong performance properties of SNBs created by combining metal oxides and POM nanoclusters into SNBs, which have great potential as redox catalysts.

         <title>Improving Image&#8208;Guided Surgical and Immunological Tumor Treatment Efficacy by Photothermal and Photodynamic Therapies Based on a Multifunctional NIR AIEgen</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrated surgery and phototheranostics employing nanoparticles based on a near&#8208;infrared aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) for image&#8208;guided synergistic tumor therapy are explored to overcome respective limitations and realize maximized therapeutic outcomes and minimized recurrences. Moreover, the combined treatment of AIEgen nanoparticle&#8208;mediated phototheranostics and programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 antibody significantly induces tumor elimination by enhancing the effect of immunotherapy.








Abstract
Multimodal therapy is attracting increasing attention to improve tumor treatment efficacy, but generally requires various complicated ingredients combined within one theranostic system to achieve multiple functions. Herein, a multifunctional theranostic nanoplatform based on a single aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission luminogen (AIEgen), DDTB, is designed to integrate near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence, photothermal, photodynamic, and immunological effects. Intravenously injected AIEgen&#8208;based nanoparticles can efficiently accumulate in tumors with NIR fluorescence to provide preoperative diagnosis. Most of the tumors are excised under intraoperative fluorescence navigation, whereafter, some microscopic residual tumors are completely ablated by photodynamic and photothermal therapies for maximally killing the tumor cells and tissues. Up to 90% of the survival rate can be achieved by this synergistic image&#8208;guided surgery and photodynamic and photothermal therapies. Importantly, the nanoparticles&#8208;mediated photothermal/photodynamic therapy plus programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 antibody significantly induce tumor elimination by enhancing the effect of immunotherapy. This theranostic strategy on the basis of a single AIEgen significantly improves the survival of cancer mice with maximized therapeutic outcomes, and holds great promise for clinical cancer treatment.

         <title>An Inorganic/Organic S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction H2&#8208;Production Photocatalyst and its Charge Transfer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of a CdS/PT inorganic/organic S&#8208;scheme heterojunction not only leads to efficient charge separation and transfer, but also increased redox ability and enhanced stability for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.








Abstract
Inspired by natural photosynthesis, constructing inorganic/organic heterojunctions is regarded as an effective strategy to design high&#8208;efficiency photocatalysts. Herein, a step (S)&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalyst is prepared by in situ growth of an inorganic semiconductor firmly on an organic semiconductor. A new pyrene&#8208;based conjugated polymer, pyrene&#8208;alt&#8208;triphenylamine (PT), is synthesized via the typical Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reactions, and then employed as a substrate to anchor CdS nanocrystals. The optimized CdS/PT composite, coupling 2 wt% PT with CdS, exhibits a robust H2 evolution rate of 9.28 mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 with continuous release of H2 bubbles, as well as a high apparent quantum efficiency of 24.3%, which is &#8776;8 times that of pure CdS. The S&#8208;scheme charge transfer mechanism between PT and CdS, is systematically demonstrated by photoirradiated Kelvin probe measurement and in situ irradiated X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. This work provides a protocol for preparing specific S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalysts on the basis of inorganic/organic coupling.

         <title>Single&#8208;Cell Immunoblotting based on a Photoclick Hydrogel Enables High&#8208;Throughput Screening and Accurate Profiling of Exogenous Gene Expression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;cell transfection analysis chip (scTAC) is developed for expression screening, precise positioning of transfected cells, and immunoblotting analysis of multi&#8208;target proteins. scTAC allows for true single&#8208;cell up&#8208;sampling and enables the acquisition of continuous single&#8208;cell protein expression even in low co&#8208;expression scenarios. scTAC provides a powerful tool for the analysis of biological pathways after transfection of rare cells.








Abstract
Fast and accurate profiling of exogenous gene expression in host cells is crucial for studying gene function in cellular and molecular biology, but still faces the challenge of incomplete co&#8208;expression of reporter genes and target genes. Here, a single&#8208;cell transfection analysis chip (scTAC) is presented, which is based on the in situ microchip immunoblotting method, for rapid and accurate analysis of exogenous gene expression in thousands of individual host cells. scTAC not only can assign information of exogenous gene activity to specific transfected cells, but enables the acquisition of continuous protein expression even in low co&#8208;expression scenarios. It is demonstrated that scTAC can reveal the relationship of expression level between reporter genes and target genes, which is helpful for evaluating transient transfection strategy efficiency. The advantages of this method for the study of fusion protein expression and downstream protein expression in signaling pathway in rare cells are shown. Empirically, an EGFP&#8208;TSPAN8 fusion plasmid is transfected into MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer cells and the expressions of two cancer stemness biomarkers (ALDHA1 and SOX2) are analyzed. The scTAC method clearly reveals an interesting phenomenon that transfected adherent MCF&#8208;7 cells exhibit some stem cell characteristics, but they do not have stem cell appearance.

         <title>A New Conjugated Polymer that Enables the Integration of Photovoltaic and Light&#8208;Emitting Functions in One Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new wide&#8208;bandgap conjugated polymer, PBQx&#8208;TCl, exhibits 18% efficiency for outdoor application and 28.5% efficiency for indoor application. Simultaneously, the PBQx&#8208;TCl&#8208;based device also shows light&#8208;emitting function with broad emission ranges from 630 to 1000 nm and moderate external quantum efficiency approaching 0.2%.








Abstract
Exploring the intriguing bifunctional nature of organic semiconductors and investigating the feasibility of fabricating bifunctional devices are of great significance in realizing various applications with one device. Here, the design of a new wide&#8208;bandgap polymer named PBQx&#8208;TCl (optical bandgap of 2.05&#160;eV) is reported, and its applications in photovoltaic and light&#8208;emitting devices are studied. By fabricating devices with nonfullerene acceptors BTA3 and BTP&#8208;eC9, it is shown that the devices exhibit a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.0% under air mass 1.5G illumination conditions and an outstanding PCE of 28.5% for a 1 cm2 device and 26.0% for a 10 cm2 device under illumination from a 1000 lux light&#8208;emitting diode. In addition, the PBQx&#8208;TCl:BTA3&#8208;based device also demonstrates a moderate organic light&#8208;emitting diode performance with an electroluminescence external quantum efficiency approaching 0.2% and a broad emission range of 630&#8211;1000&#160;nm. These results suggest that the polymer PBQx&#8208;TCl&#8208;based devices exhibit outstanding photovoltaic performance and potential light&#8208;emitting functions.

         <title>Flexible Self&#8208;Powered Integrated Sensing System with 3D Periodic Ordered Black Phosphorus@MXene Thin&#8208;Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An MXene/BP&#8208;based self&#8208;powered smart sensor system can be created by integrating a flexible pressure sensor with direct&#8208;laser&#8208;writing micro&#8208;supercapacitors and solar cells. The smart sensor system exhibits a detection capability for the state of the human heart under physiological conditions. The work for MXene materials design and system integration developed in this work offers a general platform for next&#8208;generation self&#8208;powered electronics.








Abstract
Accurate and continuous detection of physiological signals without the need for an external power supply is a key technology for realizing wearable electronics as next&#8208;generation biomedical devices. Herein, it is shown that a MXene/black phosphorus (BP)&#8208;based self&#8208;powered smart sensor system can be designed by integrating a flexible pressure sensor with direct&#8208;laser&#8208;writing micro&#8208;supercapacitors and solar cells. Using a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) self&#8208;assembly process to form a periodic interleaving MXene/BP lamellar structure results in a high energy&#8208;storage capacity in a direct&#8208;laser&#8208;writing micro&#8208;supercapacitor to drive the operation of sensors and compensate the intermittency of light illumination. Meanwhile, with MXene/BP as the sensitive layer in a flexible pressure sensor, the pressure sensitivity of the device can be improved to 77.61 kPa&#8211;1 at an optimized elastic modulus of 0.45&#160;MPa. Furthermore, the smart sensor system with fast response time (10.9&#160;ms) shows a real&#8208;time detection capability for the state of the human heart under physiological conditions. It is believed that the proposed study based on the design and integration of MXene materials will provide a general platform for next&#8208;generation self&#8208;powered electronics.

         <title>Resonant Spin Transmission Mediated by Magnons in a Magnetic Insulator Multilayer Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By developing an epitaxial magnetic insulator heterotructure, the magnon&#8208;mediated resonant spin transmission enhancement effect is achieved, where transmission of magnon spin current can be increased by more than 1000% at selected frequencies. This novel effect can provide useful mechanisms for building future magnonic devices similar to their photonic counterparts such as antireflection coatings and Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavities.








Abstract
While being electrically insulating, magnetic insulators can behave as good spin conductors by carrying spin current with excited spin waves. So far, magnetic insulators are utilized in multilayer heterostructures for optimizing spin transport or to form magnon spin valves for reaching controls over the spin flow. In these studies, it remains an intensively visited topic as to what the corresponding roles of coherent and incoherent magnons are in the spin transmission. Meanwhile, understanding the underlying mechanism associated with spin transmission in insulators can help to identify new mechanisms that can further improve the spin transport efficiency. Here, by studying spin transport in a magnetic&#8208;metal/magnetic&#8208;insulator/platinum multilayer, it is demonstrated that coherent magnons can transfer spins efficiently above the magnon bandgap of magnetic insulators. Particularly the standing spin&#8208;wave mode can greatly enhance the spin flow by inducing a resonant magnon transmission. Furthermore, within the magnon bandgap, a shutdown of spin transmission due to the blocking of coherent magnons is observed. The demonstrated magnon transmission enhancement and filtering effect provides an efficient method for modulating spin current in magnonic devices.

         <title>Poor Stability of Li2CO3 in the Solid Electrolyte Interphase of a Lithium&#8208;Metal Anode Revealed by Cryo&#8208;Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur&#8208;containing additives cause the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in lithium&#8208;metal batteries to preferentially generate Li2SO4 and overlithiated lithium sulfate and lithium oxide, which encapsulates lithium carbonate in the middle, limiting SEI thickening and enhancing battery life by a factor of ten.








Abstract
The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) dictates the cycling stability of lithium&#8208;metal batteries. Here, direct atomic imaging of the SEI's phase components and their spatial arrangement is achieved, using ultralow&#8208;dosage cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. The results show that, surprisingly, a lot of the deposited Li metal has amorphous atomic structure, likely due to carbon and oxygen impurities, and that crystalline lithium carbonate is not stable and readily decomposes when contacting the lithium metal. Lithium carbonate distributed in the outer SEI also continuously reacts with the electrolyte to produce gas, resulting in a dynamically evolving and porous SEI. Sulfur&#8208;containing additives cause the SEI to preferentially generate Li2SO4 and overlithiated lithium sulfate and lithium oxide, which encapsulate lithium carbonate in the middle, limiting SEI thickening and enhancing battery life by a factor of ten. The spatial mapping of the SEI gradient amorphous (polymeric &#8594; inorganic &#8594; metallic) and crystalline phase components provides guidance for designing electrolyte additives.

         <title>Engineering a Hydrogen&#8208;Sulfide&#8208;Based Nanomodulator to Normalize Hyperactive Photothermal Immunogenicity for Combination Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photothermal therapy (PTT), one of the most&#8208;potent cancer therapeutic strategies known, suffers from hyperactive immunity&#8208;related permanent tissue injury and high&#8208;profile tumor regeneration. In this scenario, a hydrogen sulfide donor to PTT via an amphiphilic conjugated polymer (CP) (2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridyl tetrasulfide@CP&#8208;poly(ethylene glycol)) is integrated, for advanced NIR&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;guided inflammatory modulation. The regulated inflammation preserves photothermal immunogenicity and promotes hyperthermia&#8208;induced wound healing concurrently.








Abstract
Photothermal therapy (PTT), one of the most&#8208;potent cancer therapeutic strategies known, is highlighted with excessive inflammatory response, while ablating cancer with immunogenic death. This hyperactive immune response may override PTT&#8208;triggered immunogenicity, exacerbate skin empyrosis, and incur permanent tissue injury and high&#8208;profile tumor regeneration. Therefore, an anticancer balance between pathological and protective immune response is urgently needed for an advanced photothermal therapeutic tactic. Herein, a gas&#8208;modulated photothermal immunogenicity strategy is proposed by integrating an amphiphilic&#8208;conjugated polymer with a polysulfide&#8208;based hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donor (2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridyl tetrasulfide@CP&#8208;PEG) (where CP = conjugated polymer and PEG = poly(ethylene glycol)). The CP is endowed with NIR&#8208;II fluorescence capacity and favorable photothermal effect, tracing the tumor for precise therapeutics. The polysulfide donor can release H2S triggered by intracellular glutathione, which elicits mitochondrial dysfunction and robust anti&#8208;inflammation effect. Ultimately, this gas&#8208;modulated PTT strategy inhibits tumor growth remarkably and limits the magnitude of PTT&#8208;induced proinflammatory tumor necrosis factor&#8208;alpha (TNF&#8208;&#945;), interleukin&#8208;6 (IL&#8208;6), and interleukin&#8208;1beta (IL&#8208;1&#946;) cytokines. Moreover, the regulated inflammation accelerates PTT&#8208;induced wound healing. A H2S&#8208;modulated PTT with adaptive immune response is thus recommended as an advanced strategy to cancer therapeutics.

         <title>Graphene&#8208;Like Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Melamine&#8211;Cyanuric Acid Supramolecular Nanosheets as Pseudo&#8208;Porous Catalyst Support</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular network consisting of melamine and cyanuric acid is fabricated as ultrathin nanosheets with extraordinary stability at pH = 0, serving as a pseudo&#8208;porous catalyst support to simultaneously give remarkable enhancement in the catalytic stability and activity of metal phosphides for the hydrogen evolution reaction in strong acidic conditions.








Abstract
Behaving as structural protectors and electronic modulators, catalyst supports such as graphene derivatives are generally constructed by covalent bonds. Here, hydrogen&#8208;bonded ultrathin nanosheets are reported as a new type of catalyst support. Melamine (M) and cyanuric acid (CA) molecules self&#8208;assemble to form the graphite&#8208;like hydrogen&#8208;bonded co&#8208;crystal M&#8208;CA, which can be easily exfoliated by ultrasonic treatment to yield ultrathin nanosheets with thickness of &#8776;1.6 nm and high stability at pH = 0. The dynamic nanosheets form adaptive defects/pores in the synthetic process of CoP nanoparticles, giving embedded composite with high hydrogen evolution activity (overpotential of 66 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2) and stability. Computational calculations, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy unveil the electron modulation effects of the nanosheets. This pseudo&#8208;porous catalyst support also can be applied to other metal phosphides.

A universal solution&#8208;processed bottom&#8208;up quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth of highly oriented &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite film is achieved through the synergetic effect of methylammonium chloride and a large&#8208;organic cation. In situ GIWAXS visualizes the BA&#8208;related intermediate phase formation at the bottom, which serves as a guiding template for the bottom&#8208;up quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth in the subsequent annealing process.








Abstract
Epitaxial growth gives the highest&#8208;quality crystalline semiconductor thin films for optoelectronic devices. Here, a universal solution&#8208;processed bottom&#8208;up quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth of highly oriented &#945;&#8208;formamidinium lead triiodide (&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) perovskite film via a two&#8208;step method is reported, in which the crystal orientation of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 film is precisely controlled through the synergetic effect of methylammonium chloride and the large&#8208;organic cation butylammonium bromide. In situ GIWAXS visualizes the BA&#8208;related intermediate phase formation at the bottom of film, which serves as a guiding template for the bottom&#8208;up quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth in the subsequent annealing process. The template&#8208;guided epitaxially grown BAFAMA perovskite film exhibits increased crystallinity, preferred crystallographic orientation, and reduced defects. Moreover, the BAFAMA perovskite solar cells demonstrate decent stability, maintaining 95% of their initial power conversion efficiency after 2600&#160;h ambient storage, and 4&#8208;time operation condition lifetime enhancement.

In situ GIWAXS visualizes the BA&#8208;related intermediate phase formation at the bottom, which serves as a guiding template for the bottom&#8208;up quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth in the subsequent annealing process.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epitaxial growth gives the highest&#8208;quality crystalline semiconductor thin films for optoelectronic devices. Here, a universal solution&#8208;processed bottom&#8208;up quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth of highly oriented &#945;&#8208;formamidinium lead triiodide (&#945;&#8208;FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) perovskite film via a two&#8208;step method is reported, in which the crystal orientation of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; film is precisely controlled through the synergetic effect of methylammonium chloride and the large&#8208;organic cation butylammonium bromide. In situ GIWAXS visualizes the BA&#8208;related intermediate phase formation at the bottom of film, which serves as a guiding template for the bottom&#8208;up quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth in the subsequent annealing process. The template&#8208;guided epitaxially grown BAFAMA perovskite film exhibits increased crystallinity, preferred crystallographic orientation, and reduced defects. Moreover, the BAFAMA perovskite solar cells demonstrate decent stability, maintaining 95% of their initial power conversion efficiency after 2600&#160;h ambient storage, and 4&#8208;time operation condition lifetime enhancement.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Enhance Biomimetic Cascade Catalysis for Biosensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research progress on the design and construction of biomimetic cascade reaction systems that incorporate metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF), for signal amplification in biosensing, is summarized. Notably, the mechanisms for the improvement of catalytic activity and selectivity of the MOF&#8208;involving cascade systems are discussed in detail. In addition, the challenges and opportunities in the way of the further design and applications of cascade systems with MOFs are briefly put forward.








Abstract
Multiple enzymes&#8208;induced biological cascade catalysis guides efficient and selective substrate transformations in vivo. The biomimetic cascade systems, as ingenious strategies for signal transduction and amplification, have a wide range of applications in biosensing. However, the fragile nature of enzymes greatly limits their wide applications. In this regard, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with porous structures, unique nano/microenvironments, and good biocompatibility have been skillfully used as carriers to immobilize enzymes for shielding them against hash surroundings and improving the catalytic efficiency. For another, nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like properties and brilliant stabilities (nanozymes), have been widely applied to ameliorate the low stability of the enzymes. Inheriting the abovementioned merits of MOFs, the performances of MOFs&#8208;immboilized nanozymes could be significantly enhanced. Furthermore, in addition to carriers, some MOFs can also serve as nanozymes, expanding their applications in cascade systems. Herein, recent advances in the fabrication of efficient MOFs&#8208;involving enzymes/nanozymes cascade systems and biosensing applications are highlighted. Integrating diversified signal output modes, including colorimetry, electrochemistry, fluorescence, chemiluminescence, and surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering, sensitive detection of various targets (including biological molecules, environmental pollutants, enzyme activities, and so on) are realized. Finally, challenges and opportunities about further constructions and applications of MOFs&#8208;involving cascade reaction systems are briefly put forward.

         <title>Atomically Thin Quantum Spin Hall Insulators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically thin quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulators&#8212;a class of 2D topological insulators&#8212;promises to radically transform classical and quantum electronic device concepts. Advances in materials science and engineering, alongside theoretical description are surveyed and the future perspectives for electronic applications are discussed, including the quest to realizing Majorana&#8208;based topological quantum computing&#8212;the next frontier in QSH materials research.








Abstract
Atomically thin topological materials are attracting growing attention for their potential to radically transform classical and quantum electronic device concepts. Among them is the quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator&#8212;a 2D state of matter that arises from interplay of topological band inversion and strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling, with large tunable bulk bandgaps up to 800 meV and gapless, 1D edge states. Reviewing recent advances in materials science and engineering alongside theoretical description, the QSH materials library is surveyed with focus on the prospects for QSH&#8208;based device applications. In particular, theoretical predictions of nontrivial superconducting pairing in the QSH state toward Majorana&#8208;based topological quantum computing are discussed, which are the next frontier in QSH materials research.

         <title>Micro&#8208;Bio&#8208;Chemo&#8208;Mechanical&#8208;Systems: Micromotors, Microfluidics, and Nanozymes for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micromotors, microfluidics, and nanozymes have originated as independent disciplines&#8212;today, their convergence can help solve each discipline's challenges and lead to essential advantages in bioapplications. Nanozymes significantly expand the scope of chemical reactions and fuels of catalytic micromotors with integrated dynamic responses. Microfluidics is used to mass&#8208;produce micromotors with optimal size, compositions, and core&#8211;shell properties for biomedical imaging and theranostics.








Abstract
Wireless nano&#8208;/micromotors powered by chemical reactions and/or external fields generate motive forces, perform tasks, and significantly extend short&#8208;range dynamic responses of passive biomedical microcarriers. However, before micromotors can be translated into clinical use, several major problems, including the biocompatibility of materials, the toxicity of chemical fuels, and deep tissue imaging methods, must be solved. Nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like characteristics (e.g., catalase, oxidase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase), that is, nanozymes, can significantly expand the scope of micromotors&#8217; chemical fuels. A convergence of nanozymes, micromotors, and microfluidics can lead to a paradigm shift in the fabrication of multifunctional micromotors in reasonable quantities, encapsulation of desired subsystems, and engineering of FDA&#8208;approved core&#8211;shell structures with tuneable biological, physical, chemical, and mechanical properties. Microfluidic methods are used to prepare stable bubbles/microbubbles and capsules integrating ultrasound, optoacoustic, fluorescent, and magnetic resonance imaging modalities. The aim here is to discuss an interdisciplinary approach of three independent emerging topics: micromotors, nanozymes, and microfluidics to creatively: 1) embrace new ideas, 2) think across boundaries, and 3) solve problems whose solutions are beyond the scope of a single discipline toward the development of micro&#8208;bio&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical&#8208;systems for diverse bioapplications.

         <title>Upregulating Aggregation&#8208;Induced&#8208;Emission Nanoparticles with Blood&#8211;Tumor&#8208;Barrier Permeability for Precise Photothermal Eradication of Brain Tumors and Induction of Local Immune Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional biocompatible nanoplatform based on bradykinin (BK) aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission nanoparticles (BK@AIE NPs) can specifically target brain tumors, penetrate through the blood&#8211;tumor barrier, perform photothermal therapy (PTT), and simultaneously activate the local immune system for very effective synergetic brain cancer therapy. Moreover, BK@AIE NPs&#8208;mediated PTT can eliminate cancer stem cells&#8217; recurrence associated with conventional therapy, for cancer treatment with highly improved efficacy.








Abstract
Compared to other tumors, glioblastoma (GBM) is extremely difficult to treat. Recently, photothermal therapy (PTT) has demonstrated advanced therapeutic efficacy; however, because of the relatively low tissue&#8208;penetration efficiency of laser light, its application in deep&#8208;seated tumors remains challenging. Herein, bradykinin (BK) aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission nanoparticles (BK@AIE NPs) are synthesized; these offer selective penetration through the blood&#8211;tumor barrier (BTB) and strong absorbance in the near&#8208;infrared region (NIR). The BK ligand can prompt BTB adenosine receptor activation, which enhances transportation and accumulation inside tumors, as confirmed by T1&#8208;weighted magnetic resonance and fluorescence imaging. The BK@AIE NPs exhibit high photothermal conversion efficiency under 980&#160;nm NIR laser irradiation, facilitating the treatment of deep&#8208;seated tumors. Tumor progression can be effectively inhibited to extend the survival span of mice after spatiotemporal PTT. NIR irradiation can eradicate tumor tissues and release tumor&#8208;associated antigens. It is observed that the PTT treatment of GBM&#8208;bearing mice activates natural killer cells, CD3+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and M1 macrophages in the GBM area, increasing the therapeutic efficacy. This study demonstrates that NIR&#8208;assisted BK@AIE NPs represent a promising strategy for the improved systematic elimination of GBMs and the activation of local brain immune privilege.

         <title>Plasmonic Coupling Architectures for Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excitation of plasmonic coupling architectures induces an extremely strong local electromagnetic field that can significantly impact nearby semiconductors through plasmon&#8208;driven charge/energy transfer to enhance the photocatalytic activity. Recent advances in the development of plasmonic coupling architectures and different strategies of integration with semiconductor photocatalysts are reviewed. Remaining challenges and future prospects of plasmonic coupling for sustainable solar&#8208;driven reactions are also discussed.








Abstract
Plasmonic photocatalysis is a promising approach for solar energy transformation. Comparing with isolated metal nanoparticles, the plasmonic coupling architectures can provide further strengthened local electromagnetic field and boosted light&#8208;harvesting capability through optimal control over the composition, spacing, and orientation of individual nanocomponents. As such, when integrated with semiconductor photocatalysts, the coupled metal nanostructures can dramatically promote exciton generation and separation through plasmonic&#8208;coupling&#8208;driven charge/energy transfer toward superior photocatalytic efficiencies. Herein, the principles of the plasmonic coupling effect are presented and recent progress on the construction of plasmonic coupling architectures and their integration with semiconductors for enhanced photocatalytic reactions is summarized. In addition, the remaining challenges as to the rational design and utilization of plasmon coupling structures are elaborated, and some prospects to inspire new opportunities on the future development of plasmonic coupling structures for efficient and sustainable light&#8208;driven reactions are raised.

         <title>Quantum Plasmonics: Energy Transport Through Plasmonic Gap</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum plasmonics is an emerging field of research on the quantum properties of surface plasmons and their control in light&#8211;matter interactions at the quantum level. In this review, the basics of quantum plasmonics and plasmonic resonators, nanoscale/sub&#8208;nanoscale fabrication approaches, advanced materials of resonant and nonresonant quantum energy transport and coupling are summarized along with their potential applications.








Abstract
At the interfaces of metal and dielectric materials, strong light&#8211;matter interactions excite surface plasmons; this allows electromagnetic field confinement and enhancement on the sub&#8208;wavelength scale. Such phenomena have attracted considerable interest in the field of exotic material&#8208;based nanophotonic research, with potential applications including nonlinear spectroscopies, information processing, single&#8208;molecule sensing, organic&#8208;molecule devices, and plasmon chemistry. These innovative plasmonics&#8208;based technologies can meet the ever&#8208;increasing demands for speed and capacity in nanoscale devices, offering ultrasensitive detection capabilities and low&#8208;power operations. Size scaling from the nanometer to sub&#8208;nanometer ranges is consistently researched; as a result, the quantum behavior of localized surface plasmons, as well as those of matter, nonlocality, and quantum electron tunneling is investigated using an innovative nanofabrication and chemical functionalization approach, thereby opening a new era of quantum plasmonics. This new field enables the ultimate miniaturization of photonic components and provides extreme limits on light&#8211;matter interactions, permitting energy transport across the extremely small plasmonic gap. In this review, a comprehensive overview of the recent developments of quantum plasmonic resonators with particular focus on novel materials is presented. By exploring the novel gap materials in quantum regime, the potential quantum technology applications are also searched for and mapped out.

         <title>Polymeric Microparticles Generated via Confinement&#8208;Free Fluid Instability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unexplored facile and scalable polymeric microparticle fabrication strategy via confinement&#8208;free fluid instability induced by an ultralow&#8208;surface&#8208;energy layer is reported. This method can be applied to a variety of polymers with a wide range of sizes. This research introduces an intriguing phenomenon in fluid dynamics on superamphiphobic surfaces, which should lead to more exciting discoveries in the future.








Abstract
In&#8208;fiber fluid instability can be harnessed to realize scalable microparticles fabrication with tunable sizes and multifunctional characteristics making it competitive in comparison to conventional microparticles fabrication methods. However, since in&#8208;fiber fluid instability has to be induced via thermal annealing and the resulting microparticles can only be collected after dissolving the fiber cladding, obtaining contamination&#8208;free particles for high&#8208;temperature incompatible materials remains great challenge. Herein, confinement&#8208;free fluid instability is demonstrated to fabricate polymeric microparticles in a facile manner induced by the ultralow surface energy of the superamphiphobic surface. The polymer solution columns break up into uniform droplets then form spherical particles spontaneously in seconds at ambient temperature. This method can be applied to a variety of polymers spanning an exceptionally wide range of sizes: from 1&#160;mm down to 1&#160;&#181;m. With the aid of microfluidic spinning instrument, a large quantity of microparticles can be obtained, making this method promising for scaling up production. Notably, through simple modification of the feed solution configuration, composite/structured micromaterials can also be produced, including quantum&#8208;dots&#8208;labeled fluorescent particles, magnetic particles, core&#8211;shell particles, microcapsules, and necklace&#8208;like microfibers. This method, with general applicability and facile control, is envisioned to have great prospects in the field of polymer microprocessing.

         <title>Microchannel and Nanofiber Array Morphology Enhanced Rapid Superspreading on Animals&#8217; Corneas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The respective roles of nanoscale and microscale structures in the rapid superspreading effect are explicitly clarified: the superspreading is induced by in&#8208;/out&#8208;of&#8208;plane nanocapillary forces among the nanofiber array; the microchannel is responsible for tremendously speeding up the superspreading process.








Abstract
The dynamic spreading phenomenon of liquids is vital for both understanding wetting mechanisms and visual reaction time&#8208;related applications. However, how to control and accelerate the spreading process is still an enormous challenge. Here, a unique microchannel and nanofiber array morphology enhanced rapid superspreading (RSS) effect on animals&#8217; corneas with a superspreading time (ST) of 830 ms is found, and the respective roles of the nanofiber array and the microchannel in the RSS effect are explicitly demonstrated. Specifically, the superspreading is induced by in&#8208;/out&#8208;of&#8208;plane nanocapillary forces among the nanofiber array; the microchannel is responsible for tremendously speeding up the superspreading process. Inspired by the RSS strategy, not only is an RSS surface fabricated with an ST of only 450 ms, which is, respectively, more than 26 and 1.8 times faster than conventional superamphiphilic surfaces and animal's corneas and can be applied as RSS surfaces on video monitors to record clear videos, but also it is demonstrated that the RSS effect has tremendous potential as advanced ophthalmic material surfaces to enhance its biocompatibility for clear vision.

         <title>Multivalent Nanosheet Antibody Mimics for Selective Microbial Recognition and Inactivation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multivalent nanosheet artificial antibodies with high selectivity and strong binding affinity to pathogenic bacteria are created by spontaneous assembly of various tripeptide recognition phases on transition metal dichalcogenide nanosheets. The luminescent antibody mimics can detect pathogenic bacteria at a single cell level from human serum and urine and effectively inactivate them on the wounds of infected mice for healing.








Abstract
Antibodies are widely used as recognition elements in sensing and therapy, but they suffer from poor stability, long discovery time, and high cost. Herein, a facile approach to create antibody mimics with flexible recognition phases and luminescent rigid scaffolds for the selective recognition, detection, and inactivation of pathogenic bacteria is reported. Tripeptides with a nitriloacetate&#8208;Cu group are spontaneously assembled on transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanosheets via coordination bonding, providing a diversity of TMD&#8208;tripeptide assembly (TPA) antibody mimics. TMD&#8208;TPA antibody mimics can selectively recognize various pathogenic bacteria with nanomolar affinities. The bacterial binding sites for TMD&#8208;TPA are identified by experiments and molecular dynamics simulations, revealing that the dynamic and multivalent interactions of artificial antibodies play a crucial role for their recognition selectivity and affinity. The artificial antibodies allow the rapid and selective detection of pathogenic bacteria at single copy in human serum and urine, and their effective inactivation for therapy of infected mice. This work demonstrates the potential of TMD&#8208;TPA antibody mimics as an alternative to natural antibodies for sensing and therapy.

         <title>Observation of Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov States in Superconducting Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first realization of Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov (YSR) states is shown in graphene, a non&#8208;superconducting 2D material, and without the participation of magnetic atoms. Graphene is made superconducting by the proximity effect with Pb islands. These scanning tunneling microscopy experiments reveal the very special nature of these YSR states and constitute an unequivocal demonstration of carbon magnetism at graphene grain boundaries.








Abstract
When magnetic atoms are inserted inside a superconductor, the superconducting order is locally depleted as a result of the antagonistic nature of magnetism and superconductivity. Thereby, distinctive spectral features, known as Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov states, appear inside the superconducting gap. The search for Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov states in different materials is intense, as they can be used as building blocks to promote Majorana modes suitable for topological quantum computing. Here, the first observation of Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov states in graphene, a non&#8208;superconducting 2D material, and without the participation of magnetic atoms, is reported. Superconductivity in graphene is induced by proximity effect brought by adsorbing nanometer&#8208;scale superconducting Pb islands. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy the superconducting proximity gap is measured in graphene, and Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov states are visualized in graphene grain boundaries. The results reveal the very special nature of those Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov states, which extends more than 20&#160;nm away from the grain boundaries. These observations provide the long&#8208;sought experimental confirmation that graphene grain boundaries host local magnetic moments and constitute the first observation of Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov states in a chemically pure system.

         <title>Synergetic Advantages of Atomically Coupled 2D Inorganic and Graphene Nanosheets as Versatile Building Blocks for Diverse Functional Nanohybrids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergetic coupling between atomically coupled inorganic and graphene nanosheets provides valuable opportunity to create unexpected new functionalities and to finely tailor the physicochemical properties of hybridized nanosheets. The application of homogenously mixed inorganic and graphene nanosheets as precursors leads to the synthesis of new classes of heterogeneous 2D hybrid materials with various promising functionalities in the diverse fields.








Abstract
2D nanostructured materials, including inorganic and graphene nanosheets, have evoked plenty of scientific research activity due to their intriguing properties and excellent functionalities. The complementary advantages and common 2D crystal shapes of inorganic and graphene nanosheets render their homogenous mixtures powerful building blocks for novel high&#8208;performance functional hybrid materials. The nanometer&#8208;level thickness of 2D inorganic/graphene nanosheets allows the achievement of unusually strong electronic couplings between sheets, leading to a remarkable improvement in preexisting functionalities and the creation of unexpected properties. The synergetic merits of atomically coupled 2D inorganic&#8211;graphene nanosheets are presented here in the exploration of novel heterogeneous functional materials, with an emphasis on their critical roles as hybridization building blocks, interstratified sheets, additives, substrates, and deposited monolayers. The great flexibility and controllability of the elemental compositions, defect structures, and surface natures of inorganic&#8211;graphene nanosheets provide valuable opportunities for exploring high&#8208;performance nanohybrids applicable as electrodes for supercapacitors and rechargeable batteries, electrocatalysts, photocatalysts, and water purification agents, to give some examples. An outlook on future research perspectives for the exploitation of emerging 2D nanosheet&#8208;based hybrid materials is also presented along with novel synthetic strategies to maximize the synergetic advantage of atomically mixed 2D inorganic&#8211;graphene nanosheets.

         <title>A Bottom&#8208;Up Approach to Red&#8208;Emitting Molecular&#8208;Based Nanoparticles with Natural Stealth Properties and their Use for Single&#8208;Particle Tracking Deep in Brain Tissue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent organic nanoparticles displaying intrinsic stealth properties toward biological membranes are prepared by nanoprecipitation of a hydrophobic, conjugated, red&#8208;emitting quadrupolar dye. The excellent brightness, stability, and size control down to &#8776;10&#160;nm of these nanoparticles allow for single&#8208;particle tracking deep in brain tissue. These findings point to a novel route for the bottom&#8208;up molecular design of the nano&#8211;bio interface.








Abstract
Fluorescent nanoparticles dedicated to bioimaging applications should possess specific properties that have to be maintained in the aqueous, reactive, and crowded biological environment. These include chemical and photostability, small size (on the scale of subcellular structures), biocompatibility, high brightness, and good solubility. The latter is a major challenge for inorganic nanoparticles, which require surface coating to be made water soluble. Molecular&#8208;based fluorescent organic nanoparticles (FONs) may prove a promising, spontaneously water&#8208;soluble alternative, whose bottom&#8208;up design allows for the fine&#8208;tuning of individual properties. Here, the critical challenge of controlling the interaction of nanoparticles with cellular membranes is addressed. This is a report on bright, size&#8208;tunable, red&#8208;emitting, naturally stealthy FONs that do not require the use of antifouling agents to impede interactions with cellular membranes. As a proof of concept, single FONs diffusing up to 150&#160;&#181;m deep in brain tissue are imaged and tracked.

         <title>Recent Progress in Flexible Tactile Sensors for Human&#8208;Interactive Systems: From Sensors to Advanced Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in flexible tactile sensors for human&#8208;interactive systems are reviewed, focusing on representative strategies for enhancing performance parameters and realizing tactile sensing systems beyond proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept devices. Exemplary applications, including artificial electronic skin, control interfaces, and interactive tactile interfaces are also highlighted. Finally, perspectives on potential challenges of flexible tactile sensors for practical applications are discussed.








Abstract
Flexible tactile sensors capable of measuring mechanical stimuli via physical contact have attracted significant attention in the field of human&#8208;interactive systems. The utilization of tactile information can complement vision and/or sound interaction and provide new functionalities. Recent advancements in micro/nanotechnology, material science, and information technology have resulted in the development of high&#8208;performance tactile sensors that reach and even surpass the tactile sensing ability of human skin. Here, important advances in flexible tactile sensors over recent years are summarized, from sensor designs to system&#8208;level applications. This review focuses on the representative strategies based on design and material configurations for improving key performance parameters including sensitivity, detection range/linearity, response time/hysteresis, spatial resolution/crosstalk, multidirectional force detection, and insensitivity to other stimuli. System&#8208;level integration for practical applications beyond conceptual prototypes and promising applications, such as artificial electronic skin for robotics and prosthetics, wearable controllers for electronics, and bidirectional communication tools, are also discussed. Finally, perspectives on issues regarding further advances are provided.

         <title>Capillary&#8208;Force&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly of 4D&#8208;Printed Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible and bidirectional self&#8208;assembly of microstructures is realized by two&#8208;photon&#8208;lithography&#8208;based 4D microprinting for reversible pattern/encapsulation, switchable wetting, and the dynamic actuation of microrobots/micromachines. In different evaporating solvents, the 4D&#8208;printed microstructures can exhibit three reversible geometries: (I) curved state, (II) distance&#8208;dependent coalesced clusters via traditional self&#8208;assembly, and (III) distance&#8208;independent arbitrary self&#8208;assemblies (4D self&#8208;assemblies) toward the curving directions.








Abstract
Capillary&#8208;force&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly is emerging as a significant approach for the massive manufacture of advanced materials with novel wetting, adhesion, optical, mechanical, or electrical properties. However, academic value and practical applications of the self&#8208;assembly are greatly restricted because traditional micropillar self&#8208;assembly is always unidirectional. In this work, two&#8208;photon&#8208;lithography&#8208;based 4D microprinting is introduced to realize the reversible and bidirectional self&#8208;assembly of microstructures. With asymmetric crosslinking densities, the printed vertical microstructures can switch to a curved state with controlled thickness, curvature, and smooth morphology that are impossible to replicate by traditional 3D&#8208;printing technology. In different evaporating solvents, the 4D&#8208;printed microstructures can experience three states: (I) coalesce into clusters from original vertical states via traditional self&#8208;assembly, (II) remain curved, or (III) arbitrarily self&#8208;assemble (4D self&#8208;assembly) toward the curving directions. Compared to conventional approaches, this 4D self&#8208;assembly is distance&#8208;independent, which can generate varieties of assemblies with a yield as high as 100%. More importantly, the three states can be reversibly switched, allowing the development of many promising applications such as reversible micropatterns, switchable wetting, and dynamic actuation of microrobots, origami, and encapsulation.

         <title>Chiral Perovskites for Next&#8208;Generation Photonics: From Chirality Transfer to Chiroptical Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral perovskites have attracted a considerable amount of attention in chiral photonics. Despite their exceptional dissymmetric optical behavior, a clear understanding of their chirality transfer mechanism is still elusive. Herein, the underlying chirality transfer mechanism is elucidated, based on theoretical considerations while suggesting insightful perspectives. Additionally, promising strategies to exploit the potential of chiral perovskites are also discussed.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid halide perovskites (OIHPs) are commonly used as prototypical materials for various applications, including photovoltaics, photodetectors, and light&#8208;emitting devices. Since the chiroptical properties of OIHPs are deciphered in 2017, chiral OIHPs have been rediscovered as new hybrid systems comprising chiral organic molecules and achiral inorganic octahedral layers. Owing to their exceptional optoelectrical properties and structural flexibility, chiral OIHPs have received a considerable amount of attention in chiral photonics, chiroptoelectronics, spintronics, and ferroelectrics. Despite their intriguing chiral properties, the transfer mechanism from chiral molecules to achiral semiconductors has not been extensively investigated. Furthermore, an in&#8208;depth understanding of the origin of chiroptical activity is still elusive. In this review article, recent advances in the chiroptical activities of chiral OIHPs and polarization&#8208;based devices adopting chiral OIHPs are comprehensively discussed, and insight into the underlying chirality transfer mechanism based on theoretical considerations is provided. This comprehensive survey, with an emphasis on the chirality transfer mechanism, will help readers understand the chiroptical properties of OIHPs, which are crucial for the development of spin&#8208;based photonic and optoelectronic devices. Additionally, promising strategies to exploit the potential of chiral OIHPs are also discussed.

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Guided, rAAV&#8208;Mediated IGF&#8208;I Overexpression Enables Long&#8208;Term Cartilage Repair and Protection against Perifocal Osteoarthritis in a Large&#8208;Animal Full&#8208;Thickness Chondral Defect Model at One Year In Vivo</title>

Alginate&#8208;hydrogel&#8208;guided delivery of a recombinant adeno&#8208;associated virus vector coding for a human insulin&#8208;like growth factor I (IGF&#8208;I) gene sequence (IGF&#8208;I/AlgPH155) safely enhances the repair of full&#8208;thickness chondral defects and reduces perifocal osteoarthritis and inflammation in minipigs in vivo over one year via effective IGF&#8208;I overexpression relative to control (reporter lacZ/AlgPH155) vector delivery.








Abstract
The regeneration of focal articular cartilage defects is complicated by the reduced quality of the repair tissue and the potential development of perifocal osteoarthritis (OA). Biomaterial&#8208;guided gene therapy may enhance cartilage repair by controlling the release of therapeutic sequences in a spatiotemporal manner. Here, the benefits of delivering a recombinant adeno&#8208;associated virus (rAAV) vector coding for the human insulin&#8208;like growth factor I (IGF&#8208;I) via an alginate hydrogel (IGF&#8208;I/AlgPH155) to enhance repair of full&#8208;thickness chondral defects following microfracture surgery after one year in minipigs versus control (lacZ/AlgPH155) treatment are reported. Sustained IGF&#8208;I overexpression is significantly achieved in the repair tissue of defects treated with IGF&#8208;I/AlgPH155 versus those receiving lacZ/AlgPH155 for one year and in the cartilage surrounding the defects. Administration of IGF&#8208;I/AlgPH155 significantly improves parameters of cartilage repair at one year relative to lacZ/AlgPH155 (semiquantitative total histological score, cell densities, matrix deposition) without deleterious or immune reactions. Remarkably, delivery of IGF&#8208;I/AlgPH155 also significantly reduces perifocal OA and inflammation after one year versus lacZ/AlgPH155 treatment. Biomaterial&#8208;guided rAAV gene transfer represents a valuable clinical approach to promote cartilage repair and to protect against OA.

         <title>Reverse&#8208;Engineering Strain in Nanocrystallites by Tracking Trimerons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tracking the orbital molecule formation through the Verwey transition temperature (TV) in nanorods provides a unique window into nanocrystallite strain. Particles with uniaxial tensile strain show the highest TV = 150&#160;K reported to date.








Abstract
Although strain underpins the behavior of many transition&#8208;oxide&#8208;based magnetic nanomaterials, it is elusive to quantify. Since the formation of orbital molecules is sensitive to strain, a metal&#8211;insulator transition should be a window into nanocrystallite strain. Using three sizes of differently strained Fe3O4 polycrystalline nanorods, the impact of strain on the Verwey transition and the associated formation and dissolution processes of quasiparticle trimerons is tracked. In 40 and 50&#160;nm long nanorods, increasing isotropic strain results in Verwey transitions going from TV &#8776; 60 K to 20&#160;K. By contrast, 700&#160;nm long nanorods with uniaxial strain along the (110) direction have TV &#8776; 150&#160;K&#8212;the highest value reported thus far. A metal&#8211;insulator transition, like TV in Fe3O4, can be used to determine the effective strain within nanocrystallites, thus providing new insights into nanoparticle properties and nanomagnetism.

         <title>Moisture&#8208;Triggered Self&#8208;Healing Flexible Perovskite Photodetectors with Excellent Mechanical Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A moisture&#8208;triggered self&#8208;healing flexible perovskite photodetector is presented. The lateral photodetector shows a high responsivity of 11.3&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 and a good stability to both moisture and mechanical damage. Meanwhile, damaged perovskite film can repair cracks with the assistance of a poly(vinyl alcohol) microscaffold under a humid environment and recover to 90% of its initial performance for several cycles.








Abstract
Flexible devices are urgently required to meet the demands of next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices and metal halide perovskites are proven to be suitable materials for realizing flexible photovoltaic devices. However, the tolerance to moisture corrosion and repeated mechanical bending remains a critical challenge for flexible perovskite devices. Herein, a self&#8208;healing formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) film is fabricated to cure mechanical damage by absorbing moisture from the surrounding environment. A poly(vinyl alcohol) microscaffold is designed not only to stabilize the black phase of the FAPbI3 film but also to endow it with self&#8208;healing ability in a humid environment. The photodetector based on a self&#8208;healing film exhibits a high responsivity of 11.3&#160;A W&#8722;1 and recovers to over 90% of the initial responsivity after the self&#8208;healing process. This work provides an effective self&#8208;healing strategy to stabilize the operation of flexible perovskite devices under normal high&#8208;humidity environmental conditions.

         <title>Tunable Electrocatalytic Behavior of Sodiated MoS2 Active Sites toward Efficient Sulfur Redox Reactions in Room&#8208;Temperature Na&#8211;S Batteries</title>

An elaborate multifunctional S cathode achieves superior electrochemical performance and prolonged cycling lifespan in room&#8208;temperature Na&#8211;S batteries. Beyond the physical confinement and chemical binding of polarized N&#8208;doped carbonaceous microflowers, the MoS2 active sites play a key role in catalyzing polysulfide redox reactions, and the electrocatalytic activity of MoS2 can be tunable via adjusting the discharge depth.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature (RT) sodium&#8211;sulfur (Na&#8211;S) batteries hold great promise for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to the advantages of high energy density, low cost, and resource abundance. The research progress on RT Na&#8211;S batteries, however, has been greatly hindered by the sluggish kinetics of the sulfur redox reactions. Herein, an elaborate multifunctional architecture, consisting of N&#8208;doped carbon skeletons and tunable MoS2 sulfiphilic sites, is fabricated via a simple one&#8208;pot reaction followed by in situ sulfurization. Beyond the physical confinement and chemical binding of polarized N&#8208;doped carbonaceous microflowers, the MoS2 active sites play a key role in catalyzing polysulfide redox reactions, especially the conversion from long&#8208;chain Na2Sn (4 &#8804; n&#160;&#8804; 8) to short&#8208;chain Na2S2 and Na2S. Significantly, the electrocatalytic activity of MoS2 can be tunable via adjusting the discharge depth. It is remarkable that the sodiated MoS2 exhibits much stronger binding energy and electrocatalytic behavior compared to MoS2 sites, effectively enhancing the formation of the final Na2S product. Consequently, the S cathode achieves superior electrochemical performance in RT Na&#8211;S batteries, delivering a high capacity of 774.2 mAh g&#8722;1 after 800 cycles at 0.2 A g&#8722;1, and an ultrahigh capacity retention with a capacity decay rate of only 0.0055% per cycle over 2800 cycles.

         <title>MBene as a Theranostic Nanoplatform for Photocontrolled Intratumoral Retention and Drug Release</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D zirconium boride nanosheets (ZBNs) are developed as a versatile drug delivery nanoplatform to realize near infrared (NIR)&#8208;controlled intratumoral retention and drug release by the photopyrolysis of borate ester on the surface. Combined chemothermal/gasothermal therapies based on ZBN eradicate primary tumors and interdict tumor metastasis by changing the tumor microenvironment.








Abstract
Tumor&#8208;targeted drug delivery by nanomaterials is important to improve tumor therapy efficacy and reduce toxic side effects, but its efficiency is quite limited. In this work, a new type of MBene, zirconium boride nanosheet (ZBN), as a versatile nanoplatform to realize near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;controlled intratumoral retention and drug release is developed. ZBN exhibits high NIR&#8208;photothermal conversion efficiency (76.8%), surface modification with hyaluronic acid (HA) by polyol&#8722;borate esterfication endows ZBN&#8208;HA with good dispersion, and the photopyrolysis of borate ester causes HA detachment and ZBN aggregation, enabling NIR&#8208;controlled intratumoral retention to achieve high intratumoral accumulation. By virtue of surface borate esterfication, polyol chemotherapeutic drug (doxorubicin, DOX), and NO prodrug (&#946;&#8208;galactosyl&#8208;diazeniumdiolate, Gal&#8208;NO) can be efficiently and stably conjugated on the surface of ZBN&#8208;HA (1.21&#160;g DOX or 0.57&#160;g Gal&#8208;NO per gram ZBN) without visible drug leakage, and the photopyrolysis of borate ester enables NIR&#8208;controlled drug release with high responsiveness and controllability. Combined chemothermal/gasothermal therapies based on ZBN&#8208;HA/DOX and ZBN&#8208;HA/NO nanomedicines eradicate primary tumors and interdict tumor metastasis by changing the tumor microenvironment and killing cancer cells in primary tumors. The developed NIR&#8208;photothermal MBene is confirmed as a versatile nanoplatform capable of high&#8208;efficacy tumor&#8208;targeted drug delivery and controlled drug release.

         <title>Anomalous Motion of Charged Domain Walls and Associated Negative Capacitance in Copper&#8211;Chlorine Boracite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
During switching, specific charged 90&#176; domain walls in copper&#8211;chlorine boracite are seen to move in the opposite direction to that expected, increasing the size of the domain in which polarization is anti&#8208;aligned with the applied electric field. Polarization&#8211;field hysteresis loops show negative gradients and measured switching currents confirm the negative&#8208;capacitance contribution to the overall dielectric response.








Abstract
During switching, the microstructure of a ferroelectric normally adapts to align internal dipoles with external electric fields. Favorably oriented dipolar regions (domains) grow at the expense of those in unfavorable orientations and this is manifested in a predictable field&#8208;induced motion of the walls that separate one domain from the next. Here, the discovery that specific charged 90&#176;domain walls in copper&#8211;chlorine boracite move in the opposite direction to that expected, increasing the size of the domain in which polarization is anti&#8208;aligned with the applied field, is reported. Polarization&#8211;field (P&#8211;E) hysteresis loops, inferred from optical imaging, show negative gradients and non&#8208;transient negative capacitance, throughout the P&#8211;E cycle. Switching currents (generated by the relative motion between domain walls and sensing electrodes) confirm this, insofar as their signs are opposite to those expected conventionally. For any given bias, the integrated switching charge due to this anomalous wall motion is directly proportional to time, indicating that the magnitude of the negative capacitance component should be inversely related to frequency. This passes Jonscher's test for the misinterpretation of positive inductance and gives confidence that field&#8208;induced motion of these specific charged domain walls generates a measurable negative capacitance contribution to the overall dielectric response.

         <title>Time&#8208;Dependent Phosphorescence Colors from Carbon Dots for Advanced Dynamic Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence color (TDPC) change from orange to green is realized in carbon dots (CDs) for advanced dynamic information encryption. The TDPC arises from the dual phosphorescence centers of the CDs having different decay rates, which can be simultaneously activated by irradiating with a suitable light energy (around 395 nm).








Abstract
The development of phosphorescent materials with time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence colors (TDPCs) is of considerable interest for application in advanced dynamic information encryption. In this study, TDPC is realized in carbon dots (CDs) synthesized by the one&#8208;pot hydrothermal treatment of levofloxacin. CD ink printed on paper (CD@paper) exhibits a change in phosphorescence color from orange to green, 1 s after irradiation with 395 nm light. However, when irradiated with wavelengths shorter or longer than 395 nm, the CD@paper exhibits only green or red phosphorescence, respectively. The red and green phosphorescence originates from the low&#8208;energy surface oxide triplet state and high&#8208;energy N&#8208;related triplet state, respectively. When irradiated with a suitable light energy (around 395 nm wavelength), the two phosphorescent centers can be simultaneously activated, emitting red and green phosphorescence with different decay rates. The red and green phosphorescence merge into an orange phosphorescence initially, exhibiting the TDPC phenomenon. Based on the unusual phosphorescent properties of the CDs, a kind of multilevel, dynamic phosphorescence colored 3D code is designed for advanced dynamic information encryption.

         <title>Boosting Wide&#8208;Range Tunable Long&#8208;Afterglow in 1D Metal&#8211;Organic Halide Micro/Nanocrystals for Space/Time&#8208;Resolved Information Photonics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
New metal&#8211;organic halide micro/nanocrystals with tunable afterglow luminescence, which exhibit excitation&#8208;dependent optical waveguide properties across a wide color range, as well as space/time dual&#8208;resolved afterglow, are developed. They have great potential in wavelength&#8208;division multiplexing information photonics and optical logic gates.








Abstract
Molecular afterglow materials with ultralong&#8208;lived excited states have attracted considerable interest owing to their promise for light&#8208;emitting devices, optical imaging, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications. However, the realization of ultralong afterglow emission in low&#8208;dimensional micro/nanostructures has remained an open challenge, limiting progress toward new&#8208;generation photonic applications. In this work, new types of mono/binuclear metal&#8211;organic halide micro/nanocrystals with tunable afterglow properties, made possibly by the rational control over both ultralong&#8208;lived room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence, are developed. Interestingly, the mono/binuclear coordination complexes present excitation&#8208;dependent luminescence across a wide range (wavelength &gt; 150&#160;nm) with broad emission color differences from blue to yellow owing to the multiple long&#8208;lived excited states. The 1D binuclear metal&#8211;organic microrods further exhibit excitation&#8208;dependent optical waveguide and space/time dual&#8208;resolved afterglow emission properties, endowing them with great potential in wavelength&#8208;division multiplexing information photonics and logic gates. Therefore, this work not only communicates the first example of wide&#8208;range tunable ultralong afterglow of low&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic micro/nanocrystals under ambient conditions but also provides a new route to achieve optical communications and photonic logic compilation at the micro/nanoscale.

         <title>Significantly Improving the Bioefficacy for Rheumatoid Arthritis with Supramolecular Nanoformulations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new generation of active nanotherapeutic formulations employing genetically engineered interleukin1 receptor antagonist (IL1ra) protein complexes is developed through a non&#8208;covalent supramolecular assemble approach. Extraordinary bioavailability and ultralong&#8208;acting pharmacokinetics are realized for long&#8208;acting rheumatoid arthritis therapy.








Abstract
As a typical inflammatory disease with chronic pain syndromes, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) generally requires long&#8208;term treatment with frequent injection administration at 1&#8211;2 times per day, because common medications such as interleukin1 receptor antagonist (IL1ra) have poor bioavailability and very limited half&#8208;life residence. Here a novel strategy to fabricate nanotherapeutic formulations employing genetically engineered IL1ra protein complexes, yielding ultralong&#8208;lasting bioefficacy is developed rationally. Using rat models, it is shown that these nanotherapeutics significantly improved drug regimen to a single subcutaneous administration in a 14&#8208;day therapy, suggesting their extraordinary bioavailability and ultralong&#8208;acting pharmacokinetics. Specifically, the half&#8208;life and bioavailability of the nanoformulations are boosted to the level of 30 h and by 7 times, respectively, significantly greater than other systems. This new strategy thus holds great promise to potently improve patient compliance in RA therapy, and it can be adapted for other therapies that suffer similar drawbacks.

         <title>Non&#8208;Solvent Induced Phase Separation Enables Designer Redox Flow Battery Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;solvent induced phase separation is introduced as a versatile and facile method to synthesize redox flow battery electrodes with hierarchical microstructures unachievable via conventional manufacturing approaches. Flow cell studies reveal that the novel materials can outperform conventional carbon fiber electrodes owing to better mass transfer and higher surface area, demonstrating that this method may enable new classes of porous electrodes tailored for particular electrochemical flow technologies.








Abstract
Porous carbonaceous electrodes are performance&#8208;defining components in redox flow batteries (RFBs), where their properties impact the efficiency, cost, and durability of the system. The overarching challenge is to simultaneously fulfill multiple seemingly contradictory requirements&#8212;i.e., high surface area, low pressure drop, and facile mass transport&#8212;without sacrificing scalability or manufacturability. Here, non&#8208;solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) is proposed as a versatile method to synthesize tunable porous structures suitable for use as RFB electrodes. The variation of the relative concentration of scaffold&#8208;forming polyacrylonitrile to pore&#8208;forming poly(vinylpyrrolidone) is demonstrated to result in electrodes with distinct microstructure and porosity. Tomographic microscopy, porosimetry, and spectroscopy are used to characterize the 3D structure and surface chemistry. Flow cell studies with two common redox species (i.e., all&#8208;vanadium and Fe2+/3+) reveal that the novel electrodes can outperform traditional carbon fiber electrodes. It is posited that the bimodal porous structure, with interconnected large (&gt;50 &#181;m) macrovoids in the through&#8208;plane direction and smaller (&lt;5 &#181;m) pores throughout, provides a favorable balance between offsetting traits. Although nascent, the NIPS synthesis approach has the potential to serve as a technology platform for the development of porous electrodes specifically designed to enable electrochemical flow technologies.

         <title>From Lingering to Rift: Metasurface Decoupling for Near&#8208; and Far&#8208;Field Functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enabled with independent control of the amplitude and phase of light, a general platform is proposed for completely decoupling the near&#8208; and far&#8208;field functionalities of metasurfaces. As a paradigm, a single&#8208;cell metasurface implementing the dual&#8208;functions of a metalens and a nanoprint is demonstrated; high&#8208;performance characteristics are demonstrated for both functions.








Abstract
Metasurfaces, simultaneously operating in near&#8208; and far&#8208;fields, can be employed as a promising candidate to implement different functions, thus significantly improving the information density, security, and system integration. Recent works have showcased some approaches for decoupling&#8208;at&#8208;large between near&#8208; and far&#8208;field functionalities, but unfortunately, their coupling effects are just reduced and mitigated to some extent rather than eradicated, which in turn leads to the performance limitation of metadevices. Herein, we propose a general platform for the complete rift between near&#8208; and far&#8208;field functionalities, enabled by strictly decoupled manipulation of optical amplitude and phase, leading to their distinct functions in the near&#8208; and far&#8208;fields, respectively. This concept is experimentally demonstrated by integrating the functions of a phase&#8208;only metalens and an amplitude&#8208;only grayscale&#8208;imaging nanoprint into a single&#8208;cell metasurface. Because of their completely decoupled functions, both meta&#8208;elements show high&#8208;performance characteristics, i.e., imaging quality close to the diffraction limit and high&#8208;definition grayscale&#8208;imaging with resolution as high as 63&#160;500 dots per inch (dpi). The validated recipe may empower advanced explorations and applications in highly integrated nano&#8208;optoelectronics requiring high performance and less crosstalk.

         <title>Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly&#8208;Facilitated Aggregation of Tumor&#8208;Specific Transmembrane Receptors for Signaling Activation and Converting Immunologically Cold to Hot Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular self&#8208;assembling peptide&#8208;based molecule&#8208;targeted anticancer agent (named DBT&#8208;2FFGYSA) is designed and synthesized, which can precisely visualize transmembrane EphA2 receptors in a fluorescence turn&#8208;on manner, selectively kill EphA2 receptor&#8208;overexpressed cancer cells through making the receptors form large aggregates that activate antitumorigenic signaling, and effectively convert immunologically cold tumors to hot by recruiting tumor&#8208;infiltrating T cells.








Abstract
Supramolecular self&#8208;assembling peptide systems are attracting increasing interest in the field of cancer theranostics. Additionally, transformation of the immunologically cold tumor microenvironment into hot is of great importance for obtaining high antitumor responses for most immunotherapies. However, as far as it is known, there are nearly no studies on self&#8208;assembling peptides reported to be able to convert cold to hot tumors. Herein, a self&#8208;assembling peptide&#8208;based cancer theranostic agent (named DBT&#8208;2FFGYSA) is designed and synthesized, which can target tumor&#8208;specific transmembrane Eph receptor A2 (EphA2) receptors selectively and make the receptors form large aggregates. Such aggregate formation promotes the cross&#8208;phosphorylations among EphA2 receptors, leading to signal transduction of antitumor pathway. As a consequence, DBT&#8208;2FFGYSA can not only visualize EphA2 receptors in a fluorescence turn&#8208;on manner, but also specifically suppress the EphA2 receptor&#8208;overexpressed cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth. What is more, DBT&#8208;2FFGYSA also serves as an effective agent to convert immunologically cold tumors to hot by inducing the immunogenic cell death of EphA2 receptor&#8208;overexpressed cancer cells and recruiting massive tumor&#8208;infiltrating T cells. This study, thus, introduces a new category of agents capable of converting cold to hot tumors by pure supramolecular self&#8208;assembly without any aid of known anticancer drugs.

     alt="Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly&#8208;Facilitated Aggregation of Tumor&#8208;Specific Transmembrane Receptors for Signaling Activation and Converting Immunologically Cold to Hot Tumors"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A supramolecular self&#8208;assembling peptide&#8208;based molecule&#8208;targeted anticancer agent (named DBT&#8208;2FFGYSA) is designed and synthesized, which can precisely visualize transmembrane EphA2 receptors in a fluorescence turn&#8208;on manner, selectively kill EphA2 receptor&#8208;overexpressed cancer cells through making the receptors form large aggregates that activate antitumorigenic signaling, and effectively convert immunologically cold tumors to hot by recruiting tumor&#8208;infiltrating T cells.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supramolecular self&#8208;assembling peptide systems are attracting increasing interest in the field of cancer theranostics. Additionally, transformation of the immunologically cold tumor microenvironment into hot is of great importance for obtaining high antitumor responses for most immunotherapies. However, as far as it is known, there are nearly no studies on self&#8208;assembling peptides reported to be able to convert cold to hot tumors. Herein, a self&#8208;assembling peptide&#8208;based cancer theranostic agent (named DBT&#8208;2FFGYSA) is designed and synthesized, which can target tumor&#8208;specific transmembrane Eph receptor A2 (EphA2) receptors selectively and make the receptors form large aggregates. Such aggregate formation promotes the cross&#8208;phosphorylations among EphA2 receptors, leading to signal transduction of antitumor pathway. As a consequence, DBT&#8208;2FFGYSA can not only visualize EphA2 receptors in a fluorescence turn&#8208;on manner, but also specifically suppress the EphA2 receptor&#8208;overexpressed cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth. What is more, DBT&#8208;2FFGYSA also serves as an effective agent to convert immunologically cold tumors to hot by inducing the immunogenic cell death of EphA2 receptor&#8208;overexpressed cancer cells and recruiting massive tumor&#8208;infiltrating T cells. This study, thus, introduces a new category of agents capable of converting cold to hot tumors by pure supramolecular self&#8208;assembly without any aid of known anticancer drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

PdRuIr ternary solid&#8208;solution alloy nanoparticles exhibit highly durable and active three&#8208;way catalyst performance. This work provides insights into the design of highly durable and efficient functional alloy catalysts, guiding how to best take advantage of the configurational entropy in addition to the mixing enthalpy.








Abstract
Since 1970, people have been making every endeavor to reduce toxic emissions from automobiles. After the development of a three&#8208;way catalyst (TWC) that concurrently converts three harmful gases, carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HCs), and nitrogen oxides (NOx), Rh became an essential element in automobile technology because only Rh works efficiently for catalytic NOx reduction. However, due to the sharp price spike in 2007, numerous efforts have been made to replace Rh in TWCs. Nevertheless, Rh remains irreplaceable, and now, the price of Rh is increasing significantly again. Here, it is demonstrated that PdRuM ternary solid&#8208;solution alloy nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit highly durable and active TWC performance, which will result in a significant reduction in catalyst cost compared to Rh. This work provides insights into the design of highly durable and efficient functional alloy NPs, guiding how to best take advantage of the configurational entropy in addition to the mixing enthalpy.

         <title>Programmable Design and Performance of Modular Magnetic Microswimmers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic micromodules of customized shape and position assemble to form flexible microswimmers. Through educated design, the swimming speed is optimized and the study of flocks of swimmers reveals new interactions between co&#8208;moving magnetic beaters at the low Reynolds number limit.








Abstract
Synthetic biomimetic microswimmers are promising agents for in vivo healthcare and important frameworks to advance the understanding of locomotion strategies and collective motion at the microscopic scale. Nevertheless, constructing these devices with design flexibility and in large numbers remains a challenge. Here, a step toward meeting this challenge is taken by assembling such swimmers via the programmed shape and arrangement of superparamagnetic micromodules. The method's capacity for design flexibility is demonstrated through the assembly of a variety of swimmer architectures. On their actuation, strokes characterized by a balance of viscous and magnetic forces are found in all cases, but swimmers formed from a series of size&#8208;graded triangular modules swim quicker than more traditional designs comprising a circular &#8220;head&#8221; and a slender tail. Linking performance to design, rules are extracted informing the construction of a second&#8208;generation swimmer with a short tail and an elongated head optimized for speed. Its fast locomotion is attributed to a stroke that better breaks beating symmetry and an ability to beat fully with flex at high frequencies. Finally, production at scale is demonstrated through the assembly and swimming of a flock of the triangle&#8208;based architectures to reveal four types of swimmer couplings.

         <title>Luminescent Erbium&#8208;Doped Silicon Thin Films for Advanced Anti&#8208;Counterfeit Labels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel type of security label based on downconversion photoluminescence from erbium&#8208;doped silicon is demonstrated. For fabrication of these labels, a femtosecond laser is applied to selectively irradiate Er/Si thin film and incorporate Er ions into the silicon matrix. The labels are realized by the single&#8208;step selective femtosecond&#8208;laser writing of luminescent areas or addition of chemical etching and laser writing of non&#8208;luminescent holes over the initially recorded image.








Abstract
The never&#8208;ending struggle against counterfeit demands the constant development of security labels and their fabrication methods. This study demonstrates a novel type of security label based on downconversion photoluminescence from erbium&#8208;doped silicon. For fabrication of these labels, a femtosecond laser is applied to selectively irradiate a double&#8208;layered Er/Si thin film, which is accomplished by Er incorporation into a silicon matrix and silicon&#8208;layer crystallization. The study of laser&#8208;induced heating demonstrates that it creates optically active erbium centers in silicon, providing stable and enhanced photoluminescence at 1530 nm. Such a technique is utilized to create two types of anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels. The first type is realized by the single&#8208;step direct laser writing of luminescent areas and detected by optical microscopy as holes in the film forming the desired image. The second type, with a higher degree of security, is realized by adding other fabrication steps, including the chemical etching of the Er layer and laser writing of additional non&#8208;luminescent holes over an initially recorded image. During laser excitation at 525 nm of luminescent holes of the labels, a photoluminescent picture repeating desired data can be seen. The proposed labels are easily scalable and perspective for labeling of goods, securities, and luxury&#160;items.

         <title>A Wetting&#8208;Enabled&#8208;Transfer (WET) Strategy for Precise Surface Patterning of Organohydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general wetting&#8208;enabled&#8208;transfer (WET) strategy is developed to construct discretionary shape&#8208;defined surface patterns of organohydrogels along with their monolithic formation either from flat to curved surfaces or from microscale to macroscale. The surface&#8208;patterned organohydrogels show excellent solvent resistance and mechanical properties, and can act as a soft printing template to transfer intact and robust patterns on hydrogel surfaces.








Abstract
The ability to manipulate water and oil phases in a designable manner is of great significance in widespread fields from art paintings to materials science. However, achieving precise and stable surface patterns for two immiscible phases of water and oil remains a challenge. Herein, a general wetting&#8208;enabled&#8208;transfer (WET) strategy is reported to construct discretionary shape&#8208;defined surface patterns of organohydrogels along with their monolithic formation either from flat to curved surfaces or from the microscale to the macroscale. Locally differentiated wettability induces hydrophilic monomers and hydrophobic monomers from an emulsion system onto the wettability&#8208;matching regions of the prepatterned substrates, subsequently forming corresponding hydrogel and organogel patterns on the organohydrogel surface after in situ photopolymerization. The precision of the surface patterns can be controlled by optimizing the gel monomers, emulsion droplet size, and surface chemical composition of the prepatterned substrates. This finding may provide a feasible strategy for precisely patterning functional materials from two&#8208;immiscible&#8208;phase systems.

         <title>CoPSe: A New Ternary Anode Material for Stable and High&#8208;Rate Sodium/Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;phase ternary cobalt phosphoselenide nanoparticles embedded in a layered metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;derived N&#8208;doped carbon matrix (CoPSe/NC) are fabricated through in situ synchronous phosphorization/selenization reactions using the MOF as both a template and precursor. The CoPSe/NC anode holds a set of intrinsic merits relative to its counterparts of CoSe2 or CoPS, representing an ultrastable, high&#8208;rate, and high&#8208;energy anode material for sodium/potassium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
The exploration of ideal electrode materials overcoming the critical problems of large electrode volume changes and sluggish redox kinetics induced by large ionic radius of Na+/K+ ions is highly desirable for sodium/potassium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs/PIBs) toward large&#8208;scale applications. The present work demonstrates that single&#8208;phase ternary cobalt phosphoselenide (CoPSe) in the form of nanoparticles embedded in a layered metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;derived N&#8208;doped carbon matrix (CoPSe/NC) represents an ultrastable and high&#8208;rate anode material for SIBs/PIBs. The CoPSe/NC is fabricated by using the MOF as both a template and precursor, coupled with in situ synchronous phosphorization/selenization reactions. The CoPSe anode holds a set of intrinsic merits such as lower mechanical stress, enhanced reaction kinetics, as well as higher theoretical capacity and lower discharge voltage relative to its counterpart of CoSe2, and suppressed shuttle effect with higher intrinsic electrical conductivity relative to CoPS. The involved mechanisms are evidenced by substantial characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Consequently, the CoPSe/NC anode shows an outstanding long&#8208;cycle stability and rate performance for SIBs and PIBs. Moreover, the CoPSe/NC&#8208;based Na&#8208;ion full cell can achieve a higher energy density of 274&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, surpassing that based on CoSe2/NC and most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Na&#8208;ion full cells based on P&#8208;, Se&#8208;, or S&#8208;containing binary/ternary anodes to date.

         <title>Flexible Noncontact Sensing for Human&#8211;Machine Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible noncontact sensing based on a high&#8208;sensitivity humidity sensor is realized by anchoring multilayer graphene (MG) into electrospun polyamide (PA) 66 for human&#8211;machine interaction systems, which can achieve not only asthma detection, via monitoring the respiration rate in real time, and remote alarm systems, but also touchless interfaces in medicine delivery for bedridden patients.








Abstract
From typical electrical appliances to thriving intelligent robots, the exchange of information between humans and machines has mainly relied on the contact sensor medium. However, this kind of contact interaction can cause severe problems, such as inevitable mechanical wear and cross&#8208;infection of bacteria or viruses between the users, especially during the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. Therefore, revolutionary noncontact human&#8211;machine interaction (HMI) is highly desired in remote online detection and noncontact control systems. In this study, a flexible high&#8208;sensitivity humidity sensor and array are presented, fabricated by anchoring multilayer graphene (MG) into electrospun polyamide (PA) 66. The sensor works in noncontact mode for asthma detection, via monitoring the respiration rate in real time, and remote alarm systems and provides touchless interfaces in medicine delivery for bedridden patients. The physical structure of the large specific surface area and the chemical structure of the abundant water&#8208;absorbing functional groups of the PA66 nanofiber networks contribute to the high performance synergistically. This work can lead to a new era of noncontact HMI without the risk of contagiousness and provide a general and effective strategy for the development of smart electronics that require noncontact interaction.

         <title>An Ultrasoft Self&#8208;Fused Supramolecular Polymer Hydrogel for Completely Preventing Postoperative Tissue Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
One more methylene makes a difference: introducing one extra methylene between two amides in the side chain of poly(N&#8208;acryloyl alaninamide) weakens the H&#8208;bonding interaction, resulting in an ultrasoft and highly swollen supramolecular polymer hydrogel that can be tuned to form a transient network with a self&#8208;fused and antifouling ability, which is harnessed to completely prevent postoperative tissue adhesion.








Abstract
The intermolecular H&#8208;bonding density heavily influences the gelation and rheological behavior of hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular polymer hydrogels, thus offering a delicate pathway to tailor their physicochemical properties for meeting a specific biomedical application. Herein, one methylene spacer between two amides in the side chain of N&#8208;acryloyl glycinamide (NAGA) is introduced to generate a variant monomer, N&#8208;acryloyl alaninamide (NAAA). Polymerization of NAAA in aqueous solution affords an unprecedented ultrasoft and highly swollen supramolecular polymer hydrogel due to weakened H&#8208;bonds caused by an extra methylene spacer, which is verified by variable&#8208;temperature Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and simulation calculation. Intriguingly, poly(N&#8208;acryloyl alaninamide) (PNAAA) hydrogel can be tuned to form a transient network with a self&#8208;fused and excellent antifouling capability that results from the weakened dual amide H&#8208;bonding interactions and enhanced water&#8208;amide H&#8208;bonding interactions. This self&#8208;fused PNAAA hydrogel can completely inhibit postoperative abdominal adhesion and recurrent adhesion after adhesiolysis in vivo. This transient hydrogel network allows for its disintegration and excretion from the body. The molecular mechanism studies reveal the signal pathway of PNAAA hydrogel in inhibiting inflammatory response and regulating fibrinolytic system balance. This self&#8208;fused, antifouling ultrasoft supramolecular hydrogel is promising as a barrier biomaterial for completely preventing postoperative tissue adhesion.

         <title>General and Robust Photothermal&#8208;Heating&#8208;Enabled High&#8208;Efficiency Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deposited Co3O4 thin films manifest a compelling photothermal effect upon exposure to near&#8208;infrared irradiation and raises the temperature of both inner BiVO4 nanoworms and outer FeOOH/NiOOH cocatalyst in situ, thereby leading to superior photocurrent density of 6.34&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 at 1.23 VRHE in a judiciously designed NiOOH/FeOOH/Co3O4/BiVO4 photoanode.








Abstract
The ability of photoanodes to simultaneously tailor light absorption, charge separation, and water oxidation processes represents an important endeavor toward highly efficient photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Here, a robust strategy is reported to render markedly improved PEC water splitting via sandwiching a photothermal Co3O4 layer between a BiVO4 photoanode film and an FeOOH/NiOOH electrocatalyst sheet. The deposited Co3O4 layer manifests compelling photothermal effect upon near&#8208;infrared irradiation and raises the temperature of the photoanodes in situ, leading to extended light absorption, enhanced charge transfer, and accelerated water oxidation kinetics simultaneously. The judiciously designed NiOOH/FeOOH/Co3O4/BiVO4 photoanode renders a superior photocurrent density of 6.34&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 at 1.23&#160;V versus a reversible reference electrode (VRHE) with outstanding applied bias photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency of 2.72% at 0.6&#160;VRHE. In addition to the metal oxide, a wide variety of metal sulfides, nitrides, and phosphides (e.g., CoS, CoN, and CoP) can be exploited as the heaters to yield high&#8208;performance BiVO4&#8208;based photoanodes. Apart from BiVO4, other metal oxides (e.g., Fe2O3 and TiO2) can also be covered by photothermal materials to impart significantly promoted water splitting. This simple yet general strategy provides a unique platform to capitalize on their photothermal characteristics to engineer high&#8208;performing energy conversion and storage materials and devices.

         <title>In Situ Ultrafast and Patterned Growth of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides from Inkjet&#8208;Printed Aqueous Precursors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large&#8208;area patterned transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) films with centimeter size and good controllability of the thickness and TMDC heterostructures are achieved by a facile, low&#8208;cost strategy involving printing using an industrial inkjet&#8208;printer with precisely tuned inkjet&#8208;printing parameters followed by a rapid heating process. High&#8208;quality single&#8208;domain monolayer TMDCs with millimeter size can be easily synthesized within 30 s by this method.








Abstract
Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has been widely used to synthesize high&#8208;quality 2D transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) from different precursors. At present, quantitative control of the precursor with high precision and good repeatability is still challenging. Moreover, the process to synthesize TMDCs with designed patterns is complicated. Here, by using an industrial inkjet&#8208;printer, an in situ aqueous precursor with robust usage control at the picogram (10&#8722;12 g) level is achieved, and by precisely tuning the inkjet&#8208;printing parameters, followed by a rapid heating process, large&#8208;area patterned TMDC films with centimeter size and good thickness controllability, as well as heterostructures of the TMDCs, are achieved facilely, and high&#8208;quality single&#8208;domain monolayer TMDCs with millimeter&#8208;size can be easily synthesized within 30 s (corresponding to a growth rate up to 36.4 &#181;m s&#8722;1). The resulting monolayer MoS2 and MoSe2 exhibits excellent electronic properties with carrier mobility up to 21 and 54 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, respectively. The study paves a simple and robust way for the in situ ultrafast and patterned growth of high&#8208;quality TMDCs and heterostructures with promising industrialization prospects. Moreover, this ultrafast and green method can be easily used for synthesis of other 2D materials with slight modification.

         <title>Smart Self&#8208;Assembly Amphiphilic Cyclopeptide&#8208;Dye for Near&#8208;Infrared Window&#8208;II Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex and ambiguous chemical formulas of the majority of traditional  nanoparticles stand in the way of their clinical translation. A small&#8208;molecular&#8208;based sharp pH&#8208;responding fluorescent nanoprobe for NIR&#8208;II imaging of various tumor models with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and long retention time is developed. This nanoparticle's definite chemical structure and simple production process properties highly increase its clinical translation potential.








Abstract
Development of novel nanomaterials for disease theranostics represents an important direction in chemistry and precision medicine. Fluorescent molecular probes in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#160;nm) show high promise because of their exceptional high detection sensitivity, resolution, and deep imaging depth. Here, a sharp pH&#8208;sensitive self&#8208;assembling cyclopeptide&#8208;dye, SIMM1000, as a smart nanoprobe for NIR&#8208;II imaging of diseases in living animals, is reported. This small molecule assembled nanoprobe exhibits smart properties by responding to a sharp decrease of pH in the tumor microenvironment (pH 7.0 to 6.8), aggregating from small nanoprobe (80&#160;nm at pH 7.0) into large nanoparticles (&gt;500&#160;nm at pH 6.8) with &#8776;20&#8211;30 times enhanced fluorescence compared with the non&#8208;self&#8208;assembled CH&#8208;4T. It yields micrometer&#8208;scale resolution in blood vessel imaging and high contrast and resolution in bone and tumor imaging in mice. Because of its self&#8208;aggregation in acidic tumor microenvironments in situ, SIMM1000 exhibits high tumor accumulation and extremely long tumor retention (&gt;19 days), while being excretable from normal tissues and safe. This smart self&#8208;assembling small molecule strategy can shift the paradigm of designing new nanomaterials for molecular imaging and drug development.

         <title>Redox Flow Batteries: Non&#8208;Solvent Induced Phase Separation Enables Designer Redox Flow Battery Electrodes (Adv. Mater. 16/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox flow batteries have the potential to accelerate the transition to a green&#8208;energy economy by integrating renewable technologies into the electrical grid. Their porous carbon electrodes need to balance the trade&#8208;off between mass transport and kinetics. In article number 2006716, Antoni Forner&#8208;Cuenca and co&#8208;workers show that non&#8208;solvent induced phase separation can be leveraged as a versatile and facile method for fabricating high&#8208;surface&#8208;area microstructures, with hierarchical porous architectures well&#8208;suited for use in flow batteries.

A small&#8208;molecular&#8208;based self&#8208;assembling and pH&#8208;responding NIR&#8208;II fluorescent nanoprobe is developed by Zhenhua Hu, Jie Tian, Zhen Cheng, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2006902. This nanoprobe sharply responds to a decrease of pH in the tumor microenvironment. It aggregates from small nanoprobes (80 nm at pH 7.0) into large nanoparticles (&gt;500 nm at pH 6.8), resulting in high tumor contrast and prolonged tumor retention (&gt;19d). Thus, the bright clinical translational potential of small&#8208;molecular self&#8208;assembly nanoparticles is demonstrated.

         <title>In Vitro Mineralization of Collagen</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in vitro mineralization of collagen deals with the mechanisms of bone formation and the synthesis of tissue engineering scaffolds. Due to their biological relevance, the extra&#8208; and intrafibrillar mineralization of collagen with hydroxyapatite and silica are the focus of this review. A general mechanism for the intrafibrillar mineralization of collagen is proposed.








Abstract
Collagen mineralization is a biological process in many skeletal elements in the animal kingdom. Examples of these collagen&#8208;based skeletons are the siliceous spicules of glass sponges or the intrafibrillar hydroxyapatite platelets in vertebrates. The mineralization of collagen in vitro has gained interest for two reasons: understanding the processes behind bone formation and the synthesis of scaffolds for tissue engineering. In this paper, the efforts toward collagen mineralization in vitro are reviewed. First, general introduction toward collagen type I, the main component of the extracellular matrix in animals, is provided, followed by a brief overview of collagenous skeletons.

     alt="In Vitro Mineralization of Collagen"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The in vitro mineralization of collagen deals with the mechanisms of bone formation and the synthesis of tissue engineering scaffolds. Due to their biological relevance, the extra&#8208; and intrafibrillar mineralization of collagen with hydroxyapatite and silica are the focus of this review. A general mechanism for the intrafibrillar mineralization of collagen is proposed.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collagen mineralization is a biological process in many skeletal elements in the animal kingdom. Examples of these collagen&#8208;based skeletons are the siliceous spicules of glass sponges or the intrafibrillar hydroxyapatite platelets in vertebrates. The mineralization of collagen in vitro has gained interest for two reasons: understanding the processes behind bone formation and the synthesis of scaffolds for tissue engineering. In this paper, the efforts toward collagen mineralization in vitro are reviewed. First, general introduction toward collagen type I, the main component of the extracellular matrix in animals, is provided, followed by a brief overview of collagenous skeletons. Then, the in vitro mineralization of collagen is critically reviewed. Due to their biological abundance, hydroxyapatite and silica are the focus of this review. To a much lesser extent, also some efforts with other minerals are outlined. Combining all minerals and the suggested mechanisms for each mineral, a general mechanism for the intrafibrillar mineralization of collagen is proposed. This review concludes with an outlook for further improvement of collagen&#8208;based tissue engineering scaffolds.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Rare&#8208;Earth Incorporated Alloy Catalysts: Synthesis, Properties, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rare&#8208;earth alloys are emerging catalytic materials in the field of energy conversion. They have unique electronic structures and spatial characteristics. The families of all rare&#8208;earth&#8208;alloy catalytic materials are reviewed, focusing on their synthesis, properties, structure, and applications.








Abstract
To improve the performance of metallic catalysts, alloying provides an efficient methodology to design state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art materials. As emerging functional materials, rare&#8208;earth metal compounds can integrate the unique orbital structure and catalytic behavior of rare earth elements into metallic materials. Such rare&#8208;earth containing alloy catalysts proffer an opportunity to tailor electronic properties, tune charged carrier transport, and synergize surface reactivity, which are expected to significantly improve the performance and stability of catalysis. Despite its significance, there are only few reviews on rare earth containing alloys or related topics. This review summarizes the composition, synthesis, and applications of rare earth containing alloys in the field of catalysis. Subsequent to comprehensively summarizing and constructively discussing the existing work, the challenges and possibilities of future research on rare&#8208;earth metal compound materials are evaluated.

The major challenges, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments on rational structure design strategies, surface/interface engineering, industrial anode/cathode selection, and advanced in situ/operando characterizations toward deep understanding of the working mechanism of Si&#8208;based electrodes are reviewed. It is demonstrated that Si&#8208;based anodes are promising candidates in configurations of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, Li&#8211;S batteries, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, and beyond.








Abstract
The increasing demand for higher&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries driven by advancements in electric vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles, and portable electronic devices necessitates the development of alternative anode materials with a specific capacity beyond that of traditional graphite anodes. Here, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments made in the rational design of Si&#8208;based electrodes and their progression toward practical application are presented. First, a comprehensive overview of fundamental electrochemistry and selected critical challenges is given, including their large volume expansion, unstable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) growth, low initial Coulombic efficiency, low areal capacity, and safety issues. Second, the principles of potential solutions including nanoarchitectured construction, surface/interface engineering, novel binder and electrolyte design, and designing the whole electrode for stability are discussed in detail. Third, applications for Si&#8208;based anodes beyond LIBs are highlighted, specifically noting their promise in configurations of Li&#8211;S batteries and all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. Fourth, the electrochemical reaction process, structural evolution, and degradation mechanisms are systematically investigated by advanced in situ and operando characterizations. Finally, the future trends and perspectives with an emphasis on commercialization of Si&#8208;based electrodes are provided. Si&#8208;based anode materials will be key in helping keep up with the demands for higher energy density in the coming decades.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metal dichalcogenide stacking&#8208;engineered heterostructures, from controllable fabrication to typical characterization, are reviewed in detail and the stacking&#8208;correlated physical behaviors are presented. Furthermore, recent advances in stacking design, such as stacking sequence, twist angles, and moir&#233; superlattice heterojunctions, are also comprehensively summarized. Finally, the remaining challenges and possible strategies for using stacking engineering to tune the properties of 2D materials are outlined.








Abstract
The layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of 2D transition metal dichalcogenide monolayer blocks to form a 3D stack, with a precisely chosen sequence/angle, is the newest development for these materials. In this way, one can create &#8220;van der Waals heterostructures (HSs),&#8221; opening up a new realm of materials engineering and novel devices with designed functionalities. Herein, a detailed systematic review of transition metal dichalcogenide stacking&#8208;engineered heterostructures, from controllable fabrication to typical characterization, and stacking&#8208;correlated physical behaviors is presented. Furthermore, recent advances in stacking design, such as stacking sequence, twist angles, and moir&#233; superlattice heterojunctions, are also comprehensively summarized.

         <title>Top&#8208;Level Design Strategy to Construct an Advanced High&#8208;Entropy Co&#8211;Cu&#8211;Fe&#8211;Mo (Oxy)Hydroxide Electrocatalyst for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A top&#8208;level design strategy assisted by density functional theory is reported to guide and design advanced high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts and their enhanced catalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance is successfully predicted. A new low&#8208;temperature electrochemical reconstruction method is developed to fabricate the as&#8208;predicted high&#8208;entropy catalysts. The as&#8208;prepared high&#8208;entropy Co&#8211;Cu&#8211;Fe&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxide electrocatalyst exhibits exceptional electrocatalytic OER performance, consistent with theory calculations.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy materials are new&#8208;generation electrocatalysts for water splitting due to their excellent reactivity and highly tailorable electrochemical properties. Herein, a powerful top&#8208;level design strategy is reported to guide and design advanced high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts by establishing reaction models (e.g., reaction energy barrier, conductivity, adsorption geometries for intermediates, and rate&#8208;determining step) to predict performance with the help of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Accordingly, novel high&#8208;entropy Co&#8211;Cu&#8211;Fe&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxide electrocatalysts are fabricated by a new low&#8208;temperature electrochemical reconstruction method and their oxygen evolution reaction (OER) properties are thoroughly characterized. These as&#8208;prepared quaternary metallic (oxy)hydroxides present much better OER performance than ternary Co&#8211;Cu&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxide, Co&#8211;Fe&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxide, and other counterparts, and are demonstrated with a low overpotential of 199&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a 48.8&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 Tafel slope in 1 m KOH and excellent stability without decay over 72 h. The performance enhancement mechanism is also unraveled by synchrotron radiation. The work verifies the usefulness of high&#8208;entropy design and the great synergistic effect on OER performance by the incorporation of four elements, and also provides a new method for the construction of advanced high&#8208;entropy materials for energy conversion and storage.

         <title>Polymer Dielectrics with Simultaneous Ultrahigh Energy Density and Low Loss</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zwitterion&#8208;functionalized polymers are synthsized with a record&#8208;high breakdown strength of 1300 MV&#160;m&#8722;1, energy density above 35 J&#160;cm&#8722;3, and charge&#8211;discharge efficiency of &gt;90%, taking advantage of the covalent&#8208;bonding restricted ion polarization and the charge trapping of the ion cluster phase.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics are highly desirable in capacitor applications due to their low cost, high breakdown strength, and unique self&#8208;healing capability. However, existing polymer dielectrics suffer from either a low energy density or a high dielectric loss, thereby hindering the development of compact, efficient, and reliable power electronics. Here, a novel type of polymer dielectrics simultaneously exhibiting an extraordinarily high recoverable energy density of 35 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and a low dielectric loss is reported. It is synthesized by grafting zwitterions onto the short side chains of a poly(4&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;pentene) (PMP)&#8208;based copolymer, which increases its dielectric constant from &#8776;2.2 to &#8776;5.2 and significantly enhances its breakdown strength from &#8776;700 MV&#160;m&#8722;1 to &#8776;1300 MV&#160;m&#8722;1 while maintaining its low dielectric loss of &lt;0.002 and high charge&#8211;discharge efficiency of &gt;90%. Based on a combination of the phase&#8208;field method description of mesoscale structures, Maxwell equations, and theoretical analysis, it is demonstrated that the outstanding combination of high energy density and low dielectric loss of zwitterions&#8208;grafted copolymers is attributed to the covalent&#8208;bonding restricted ion polarization and the strong charge trapping by the zwitterions. This work represents a new strategy in polymer dielectrics for achieving simultaneous high energy density and low dielectric loss.

         <title>Programmed Size&#8208;Changeable Nanotheranostic Agents for Enhanced Imaging&#8208;Guided Chemo/Photodynamic Combination Therapy and Fast Elimination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanotheranostic agent, which can realize two&#8208;stage programmed size changes, is developed for enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#8208;guided chemo/photodynamic combination therapy. Once the nano&#8208;sized agents reach the acidic tumor microenvironment, large aggregates will be formed for enhanced MRI. After their theranostic functionalities exhaust, large&#8208;sized aggregates will be transformed into monodisperse small&#8208;sized particles for fast elimination.








Abstract
An ideal nanotheranostic agent should be able to achieve efficient tumor accumulation, retention, and fast elimination after its theranostic functions exhausts. However, there is an irreconcilable contradiction on optimum sizes for effective tumor retention and fast elimination. Herein, a programmed size&#8208;changeable nanotheranostic agent based on polyprodrug&#8208;modified iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission photosensitizer is developed for enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#8208;guided chemo/photodynamic combination therapy. The nano&#8208;sized theranostic agents with an initial diameter of about 90&#160;nm can accumulate in tumor tissue through passive targeting. In the acidic tumor microenvironment, large aggregates of IONPs are formed, realizing enhanced tumor retention and MR signal enhancement. Under the guidance of MRI, light irradiation is applied to the tumor site for triggering the generation of reactive oxygen species and drug release. Moreover, after chemo/photodynamic combination therapy, the large&#8208;sized aggregates are re&#8208;dispersed into small&#8208;sized IONPs for fast elimination, reducing the risk of toxicity caused by long&#8208;term retention. Therefore, this study provides a promising size&#8208;changeable strategy for the development of nanotheranostic agents.

         <title>Dispersion&#8208;Controlled Gold&#8211;Aluminum&#8211;Silicon Dioxide&#8211;Aluminum Nanopawn Structures for Visible to NIR Light Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dispersion&#8208;controlled Au nanocolloidal lithography is developed, offering high selectivity for Al and SiO2 over Au nanoparticles. By customizing the SF6 etching&#8208;gas flow and inductively coupled plasma power conditions, uniformly dispersed multi&#8208;material nanopawn structures with good sidewall verticality (&#8776;90&#176;) and high aspect ratio (&gt;1) are demonstrated. As practical applications, triple&#8208;channel color filters and complementary&#8208;color information encryption are demonstrated.








Abstract
As an efficient patterning method for nanostructures, nanocolloidal lithography (NCL) presents a controllable and scalable means for achieving a uniform and good sidewall profile, and a high aspect ratio. While high selectivity between the etching mask and targeted materials is also essential for NCL&#8208;based precision nanophotonic structures, its realization in multi&#8208;material nanophotonic structures still remains a challenge due to the dielectric&#8208; or metallic&#8208;material&#8208;dependent etching selectivity. Here, dispersion&#8208;controlled Au&#8208;NCL is proposed, which enables high selectivity for Al and SiO2 over a Au nanoparticle (Au&#8208;NP) mask. Utilizing the proposed process, wafer&#8208;scale, uniformly dispersed multi&#8208;material nanopawn structures (Au&#8208;NPs/Al&#8211;SiO2 cylinders) on an Al ultrathin film are realized, obtaining excellent vertical sidewall (&#8776;90&#176;) and aspect ratio (&gt;1). The high sidewall verticality and aspect ratio of the nanopawn structures support optical modes highly sensitive to the excitation direction of incident waves through the mixing of the interface&#8208;gap&#8208;assisted localized surface plasmons (GLSPs) formed in between the Au&#8208;NP and Al&#8208;disk interface, and plasmonic Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot (FP) modes formed in between the Al&#8208;disk and Al substrate; complementary spectral responses between reflected and scattered light are also demonstrated. As an application example, information encryption based on the triple&#8208;channel (i.e., reflection, scattering, and transmission) angle&#8208;dependent complementary&#8208;color responses is presented.

         <title>Epitaxial Single&#8208;Crystal Growth of Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Monolayers via the Atomic Sawtooth Au Surface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomic sawtooth Au surface allows the anisotropic adsorption energy of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMdC) clusters to yield unidirectional epitaxial growth of triangular TMdC grains, eventually forming a single&#8208;crystal TMdC film, regardless of the Miller indices. Growth using the atomic sawtooth gold surface as a universal growth template is further demonstrated for several TMdC monolayer films, including WS2, WSe2, MoS2, the MoSe2/WSe2 heterostructure, and W1&#8722;xMoxS2 alloys.








Abstract
Growth of 2D van der Waals layered single&#8208;crystal (SC) films is highly desired not only to manifest the intrinsic physical and chemical properties of materials, but also to enable the development of unprecedented devices for industrial applications. While wafer&#8208;scale SC hexagonal boron nitride film has been successfully grown, an ideal growth platform for diatomic transition metal dichalcogenide (TMdC) films has not been established to date. Here, the SC growth of TMdC monolayers on a centimeter scale via the atomic sawtooth gold surface as a universal growth template is reported. The atomic tooth&#8208;gullet surface is constructed by the one&#8208;step solidification of liquid gold, evidenced by transmission electron microscopy. The anisotropic adsorption energy of the TMdC cluster, confirmed by density&#8208;functional calculations, prevails at the periodic atomic&#8208;step edge to yield unidirectional epitaxial growth of triangular TMdC grains, eventually forming the SC film, regardless of the Miller indices. Growth using the atomic sawtooth gold surface as a universal growth template is demonstrated for several TMdC monolayer films, including WS2, WSe2, MoS2, the MoSe2/WSe2 heterostructure, and W1&#8722;xMoxS2 alloys. This strategy provides a general avenue for the SC growth of diatomic van der Waals heterostructures on a wafer scale, to further facilitate the applications of TMdCs in post&#8208;silicon technology.

         <title>Perovskite Quantum Dots with Ultralow Trap Density by Acid Etching&#8208;Driven Ligand Exchange for High Luminance and Stable Pure&#8208;Blue Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes based on stable small&#8208;sized CsPbBr3 quantum dots obtained by a novel acid etching&#8208;driven ligand exchange exhibit blue emission (470&#160;nm) with record luminance of 3850&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, external quantum efficiency of 4.7%, and long&#8208;term operational stability of 12 h.








Abstract
The research on metal halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with green and infrared emission has demonstrated significant progress in achieving higher functional performance. However, the realization of stable pure&#8208;blue (&#8776;470&#160;nm wavelength) PeLEDs with increased brightness and efficiency still constitutes a considerable challenge. Here, a novel acid etching&#8208;driven ligand exchange strategy is devised for achieving pure&#8208;blue emitting small&#8208;sized (&#8776;4&#160;nm) CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots (QDs) with ultralow trap density and excellent stability. The acid, hydrogen bromide (HBr), is employed to etch imperfect [PbBr6]4&#8722; octahedrons, thereby removing surface defects and excessive carboxylate ligands. Subsequently, didodecylamine and phenethylamine are successively introduced to bond the residual uncoordinated sites of the QDs and attain in situ exchange with the original long&#8208;chain organic ligands, resulting in near&#8208;unity quantum yield (97%) and remarkable stability. The QD&#8208;based PeLEDs exhibit pure&#8208;blue electroluminescence at 470&#160;nm (corresponding to the Commission Internationale del'Eclairage (CIE) (0.13,&#160;0.11) coordinates), an external quantum efficiency of 4.7%, and a remarkable luminance of 3850&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, which is the highest brightness reported so far for pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs. Furthermore, the PeLEDs exhibit robust durability, with a half&#8208;lifetime exceeding 12 h under continuous operation, representing a record performance value for blue PeLEDs.

         <title>3D Printing of Transparent Spinel Ceramics with Transmittance Approaching the Theoretical Limit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnesium aluminate spinel transparent ceramics with transmittance reaching 97% of the theoretical limit are successfully 3D printed with a high printing resolution of &#8776;100&#8211;200&#160;&#181;m. Application of the printed ceramics for optical imaging and photocatalyst support is explored.








Abstract
3D printing of transparent ceramics has attracted great attention recently but faces the challenges of low transparency and low printing resolution. Herein, magnesium aluminate spinel transparent ceramics with transmittance reaching 97% of the theoretical limit are successfully fabricated using a stereolithography&#8208;based 3D printing method assisted by hot isostatic pressing and the critical factors governing the transparency are revealed. Various transparent spinel lenses and microlattices are printed at a high resolution of &#8776;100&#8211;200&#160;&#181;m. The 3D printed spinel lens demonstrates fairly good optical imaging ability, and the printed spinel diamond microlattices as a transparent photocatalyst support for TiO2 significantly enhance its photocatalytic efficiency compared with its opaque counterparts. Compared with other 3D printed transparent materials such as silica glass or organic polymers, the printed spinel ceramics have the advantages of broad optical window, high hardness, excellent high&#8208;temperature stability, and chemical resistance and therefore, have great potential to be used in various optical lenses/windows and photocatalyst supports for application in harsh environments.

         <title>Wicking&#8211;Polarization&#8208;Induced Water Cluster Size Effect on Triboelectric Evaporation Textiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A textile that can couple active triboelectric polarization and passive wicking to break&#8208;up large&#8208;sized water clusters into small&#8208;sized water clusters or water monomers is reported to promote sweat evaporation. This textile is a useful weapon for eliminating sweat produced by strenuous exercise, and it also shows broad application prospects in quick&#8208;drying sportswear, cooling fabrics and wireless sports monitoring insoles.








Abstract
Sweating during exercise, physical labor, or hot weather leads to a feeling of discomfort. The stuffiness, stickiness, and heaviness brought by sweat may promote negative emotions or disease. Clothing, textiles, and wearable devices exacerbate these problems by restricting evaporation of sweat. Here, a textile that can promote and enhance sweat evaporation by coupling wicking and polarization is reported. The wicking is produced by the wettability gradient and pore size, which make the surface moisture content of the textile in contact with the skin strictly 0%. The polarization is driven by a ferroelectric&#8208;enhanced triboelectric textile. This textile degrades large&#8208;sized water clusters into small&#8208;sized water clusters or water monomers, so that the textiles have an excellent moisture evaporation rate (4.4 and 3.6 times faster than the cotton and polyester textiles, respectively). This work provides a new source of inspiration for quick&#8208;drying textiles and also finds an attractive application for triboelectric technology.

         <title>Color of Copper/Copper Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically flat perfect single&#8208;crystal Cu films prepared by the atomic&#8208;sputtering epitaxy method realize the coherent propagation of an oxidation front and display full&#8208;color by controlling the oxide&#8208;layer thickness. More than 50% of the standard red/green/blue color space is covered. Laser&#8208;oxide lithography forming a microscale local oxide embedded in metal is introduced.








Abstract
Stochastic inhomogeneous oxidation is an inherent characteristic of copper (Cu), often hindering color tuning and bandgap engineering of oxides. Coherent control of the interface between metal and metal oxide remains unresolved. Coherent propagation of an oxidation front in single&#8208;crystal Cu thin film is demonstrated to achieve a full&#8208;color spectrum for Cu by precisely controlling its oxide&#8208;layer thickness. Grain&#8208;boundary&#8208;free and atomically flat films prepared by atomic&#8208;sputtering epitaxy allow tailoring of the oxide layer with an abrupt interface via heat treatment with a suppressed temperature gradient. Color tuning of nearly full&#8208;color red/green/blue indices is realized by precise control of the oxide&#8208;layer thickness; the samples cover &#8776;50.4% of the standard red/green/blue color space. The color of copper/copper oxide is realized by the reconstruction of the quantitative yield color from the oxide &#8220;pigment&#8221; (complex dielectric functions of Cu2O) and light&#8208;layer interference (reflectance spectra obtained from the Fresnel equations) to produce structural color. Furthermore, laser&#8208;oxide lithography is demonstrated with micrometer&#8208;scale linewidth and depth through local phase transformation to oxides embedded in the metal, providing spacing necessary for semiconducting transport and optoelectronics functionality.

         <title>Anomalous High&#8208;Temperature Superconductivity in YH6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel yttrium hexahydride YH6 is synthesized, an outstanding high&#8208;TC superconductor with critical temperature of 224&#8211;226&#160;K and unexpectedly large upper critical magnetic field &#8776;116&#8211;158 T. YH6 demonstrates high critical current density of &#8776;3500&#160;A mm&#8722;2 at 4&#160;K, which is above that of NbTi and YBCO. This study points to a possible additional nonconventional contribution to superconductivity in YH6.








Abstract
Pressure&#8208;stabilized hydrides are a new rapidly growing class of high&#8208;temperature superconductors, which is believed to be described within the conventional phonon&#8208;mediated mechanism of coupling. Here, the synthesis of one of the best&#8208;known high&#8208;TC superconductors&#8212;yttrium hexahydride Im3&#175;m&#8208;YH6 is reported, which displays a superconducting transition at &#8776;224&#160;K at 166&#160;GPa. The extrapolated upper critical magnetic field Bc2(0)&#160;of YH6 is surprisingly high: 116&#8211;158&#160;T, which is 2&#8211;2.5 times larger than the calculated value. A pronounced shift of TC in yttrium deuteride YD6 with the isotope coefficient 0.4 supports the phonon&#8208;assisted superconductivity. Current&#8211;voltage measurements show that the critical current IC and its density JC may exceed 1.75&#160;A and 3500&#160;A mm&#8722;2 at 4&#160;K, respectively, which is higher than that of the commercial superconductors, such as NbTi and YBCO. The results of superconducting density functional theory (SCDFT) and anharmonic calculations, together with anomalously high critical magnetic field, suggest notable departures of the superconducting properties from the conventional Migdal&#8211;Eliashberg and Bardeen&#8211;Cooper&#8211;Schrieffer theories, and presence of an additional mechanism of superconductivity.

         <title>A Multichannel Ca2+ Nanomodulator for Multilevel Mitochondrial Destruction&#8208;Mediated Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A curcumin (CUR) and cisplatin (CDDP) co&#8208;incorporating multichannel calcium&#8208;ion (Ca2+) nanomodulator (PEGCaNMCUR+CDDP) demonstrates enhanced anticancer efficacy owing to induced multilevel mitochondrial damage by Ca2+ overload, which is promoted by the degradation of amorphous calcium carbonate, the CUR&#8208;mediated Ca2+ metabolism, and the CDDP&#8208;augmented synergistic destruction of mitochondria, which can be visualized by both fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging.








Abstract
Subcellular organelle&#8208;targeted nanoformulations for cancer theranostics are receiving increasing attention owing to their benefits of precise drug delivery, maximized therapeutic index, and reduced off&#8208;target side effects. Herein, a multichannel calcium ion (Ca2+) nanomodulator (CaNMCUR+CDDP), i.e., a cisplatin (CDDP) and curcumin (CUR) co&#8208;incorporating calcium carbonate (CaCO3) nanoparticle, is prepared by a facile one&#8208;pot strategy in a sealed container with in situ synthesized polydopamine (PDA) as a template to enhance Ca2+&#8208;overload&#8208;induced mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer therapy. After systemic administration, the PEGylated CaNMCUR+CDDP (PEGCaNMCUR+CDDP) selectively accumulates in tumor tissues, enters tumor cells, and induces multilevel destruction of mitochondria by the combined effects of burst Ca2+ release, Ca2+ efflux inhibition by CUR, and chemotherapeutic CDDP, thereby observably boosting mitochondria&#8208;targeted tumor inhibition. Fluorescence imaging of CUR combined with photoacoustic imaging of PDA facilitates the visualization of the nanomodulator. The facile and practical design of this multichannel Ca2+ nanomodulator will contribute to the development of multimodal bioimaging&#8208;guided organelle&#8208;targeted cancer therapy in the future.

         <title>Mechanically Efficient Cellular Materials Inspired by Cuttlebone</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex structure and functional advantages of the cuttlebone are revealed. The cuttlebone structure, constructed like lamellar septa, separated by asymmetric, distorted S&#8208;shaped walls, exhibits superior strength and energy&#8208;absorption capability to the octet&#8208;truss lattice and conventional polymer and metal foams. This study represents an effective approach for the design and engineering of high&#8208;performance cellular materials through bioinspired 3D printing.








Abstract
Cellular materials with excellent mechanical efficiency are essential for aerospace structures, lightweight vehicles, and energy absorption. However, current synthetic cellular materials, such as lattice materials with a unit cell arranged in an ordered hierarchy, are still far behind many biological cellular materials in terms of both structural complexity and mechanical performance. Here, the complex porous structure and the mechanics of the cuttlebone are studied, which acts as a rigid buoyancy tank for cuttlefish to resist large hydrostatic pressure in the deep&#8208;sea environment. The cuttlebone structure, constructed like lamellar septa, separated by asymmetric, distorted S&#8208;shaped walls, exhibits superior strength and energy&#8208;absorption capability to the octet&#8208;truss lattice and conventional polymer and metal foams. Inspired by these findings, mechanically efficient cellular materials are designed and fabricated by 3D printing, which are greatly demanded for many applications including aerospace structures and tissue&#8208;engineering&#8208;scaffold. This study represents an effective approach for the design and engineering of high&#8208;performance cellular materials through bioinspired 3D printing.

         <dc:description>
Electrically tunable phase and Goos&#8211;H&#228;nchen (G&#8211;H)&#160;shifts in the visible wavelengths using an innovative design of lithography&#8208;free nanophotonic cavities are experimentally presented. By using the temperature&#8208;induced refractive index changes of transparent dielectric film and the structural phase&#8208;change properties of chalcogenide phase&#8208;change material, wide tunability in G&#8211;H&#160;shift at the singular phase of light is demonstrated.








Abstract
The change of the phase of light under the evolution of a nanomaterial with time is a promising new research direction. A phenomenon directly related to the sudden phase change of light is the Goos&#8211;H&#228;nchen&#160;(G&#8211;H) shift, which describes the lateral beam displacement of the reflected light from the interface of two media when the angles of incidence are close to the total internal reflection angle or Brewster angle. Here, an innovative design of lithography&#8208;free nanophotonic cavities to realize electrically tunable G&#8211;H shifts at the singular phase of light in the visible wavelengths is reported. Reversible electrical tuning of phase and G&#8211;H shifts is experimentally demonstrated using a microheater integrated optical cavity consisting of a dielectric film on an absorbing substrate through a Joule heating mechanism. In particular, an enhanced G&#8211;H shift of 110 times of the operating wavelength at the Brewster angle of the thin&#8208;film cavity is reported. More importantly, electrically tunable G&#8211;H shifts are demonstrated by exploiting the significant tunable phase change that occurs at the Brewster angles, due to the small temperature&#8208;induced refractive index changes of the dielectric film. Realizing efficient electrically tunable G&#8211;H shifts with miniaturized heaters will extend the research scope of the G&#8211;H shift phenomenon and its applications.

The pursuit for high bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic activity is the key issue to achieve advanced rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries. In article number 2008606, Bo&#8208;Quan Li and co&#8208;workers fabricate a composite noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free electrocatalyst with bifunctional activity of &#916;E = 0.63 V. Such high bifunctional activity greatly refreshes the record by ca. 50 mV and renders extraordinary performances of corresponding rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries.

In article number 2008091, Mingzhu Li, Wei E. I. Sha, Yanlin Song, and co&#8208;workers design and fabricate colorful efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs) incorporating moir&#233; interference structures by imprinting with a commercial DVD disc. The light&#8208;harvesting is boosted by elongation of the optical path and &#8220;folding&#8221; sunlight into the perovskite layer through changing the rotation angle. The moir&#233;&#8208;PSC with an optimized 30&#176; rotation angle achieves an efficiency over 21.76%.

         <dc:description>
Oil&#8208;spills have devastating effects on the surrounding ecosystems. In article number 2008460, Katja Loos and co&#8208;workers report a possible environmental remediation solution using a new generation of biobased superamphiphilic vitrimer epoxy resin (SAVER) membranes to separate oil and water efficiently. The ease with which SAVER membranes can be manufactured, used, recycled, and re&#8208;used&#8212;without losing value&#8212;indicates new directions in designing a closed&#8208;loop superamphiphilic membrane life cycle.

         <title>Monotherapy and Combination Therapy Using Anti&#8208;Angiogenic Nanoagents to Fight Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview of monotherapy and combination therapy using anti&#8208;angiogenic agents for fighting cancer is presented. Traditional cancer anti&#8208;angiogenic monotherapy and its limitations are summarized. Then, anti&#8208;angiogenic nanoagents and how they can be used in combined strategies with chemo/radio/photo/immunotherapy are illustrated. This review can provide valuable instruction on anti&#8208;angiogenic and combined strategies to improve anti&#8208;tumor outcome.








Abstract
Anti&#8208;angiogenic therapy, targeting vascular endothelial cells (ECs) to prevent tumor growth, has been attracting increasing attention in recent years, beginning with bevacizumab (Avastin) through its Phase II/III clinical trials on solid tumors. However, these trials showed only modest clinical efficiency; moreover, anti&#8208;angiogenic therapy may induce acquired resistance to the drugs employed. Combining advanced drug delivery techniques (e.g., nanotechnology) or other therapeutic strategies (e.g., chemotherapy, radiotherapy, phototherapy, and immunotherapy) with anti&#8208;angiogenic therapy results in significantly synergistic effects and has opened a new horizon in fighting cancer. Herein, clinical difficulties in using traditional anti&#8208;angiogenic therapy are discussed. Then, several promising applications of anti&#8208;angiogenic nanoagents in monotherapies and combination therapies are highlighted. Finally, the challenges and perspectives of anti&#8208;angiogenic cancer therapy are summarized. A useful introduction to anti&#8208;angiogenic strategies, which may significantly improve therapeutic outcomes, is thus provided.

         <title>Photodetectors of 2D Materials from Ultraviolet to Terahertz Waves</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The main mechanisms and recent significant progress of 2D material photodetectors from ultraviolet to terahertz waves are summarized. The overestimated performance of 2D material photodetectors is revealed. Photodetectors of 2D materials are compared with conventional materials, and an electromagnetic induced well (EIW) mechanism strategy is proposed to utilize the thinness advantage of 2D materials to develop excellent photodetectors.








Abstract
2D materials are considered to be the most promising materials for photodetectors due to their unique optical and electrical properties. Since the discovery of graphene, many photodetectors based on 2D materials have been reported. However, the low quantum efficiency, large noise, and slow response caused by the thinness of 2D materials limit their application in photodetectors. Here, recent progress on 2D material photodetectors is reviewed, covering the spectrum from ultraviolet to terahertz waves. First the interaction of 2D materials with light is analyzed in terms of optical physics. Then the present methods to improve the performance of 2D material photodetectors are summarized, such as defect engineering, p&#8211;n junctions and hybrid detectors, and the issue of serious overestimation of the performance in reported photodetectors based on 2D materials is discussed. Next, a comparison of 2D material photodetectors with traditional commercially available detectors shows that it is difficult to balance the current 2D material photodetectors with regard to having simultaneously both high sensitivity and fast response. Finally, a possible novel EIW mechanism is suggested to advance the performance of 2D material photodetectors in the future.

         <title>2D Homojunctions for Electronics and Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The booming development of 2D homojunctions has received tremendous attention over the past years. The recent research progress on the construction strategies and device applications in electronics and optoelectronics is comprehensively summarized.








Abstract
In the post&#8208;Moore era, 2D materials with rich physical properties have attracted widespread attention from the scientific and industrial communities. Among 2D materials, the 2D homojunctions are of great promise in designing novel electronic and optoelectronic devices due to their unique geometries and properties such as homogeneous components, perfect lattice matching, and efficient charge transfer at the interface. In this article, a pioneering review focusing on the structural design and device application of 2D homojunctions such as p&#8211;n homojunctions, heterophase homojunctions, and layer&#8208;engineered homojunctions is provided. The preparation strategies to construct 2D homojunctions including vapor&#8208;phase deposition, lithium intercalation, laser irradiation, chemical doping, electrostatic doping, and photodoping are summarized in detail. Specifically, a careful review on the applications of the 2D homojunctions in electronics (e.g., field&#8208;effect transistors, rectifiers, and inverters) and optoelectronics (e.g., light&#8208;emitting diodes, photovoltaics, and photodetectors) is provided. Eventually, the current challenges and future perspectives are commented for promoting the rapid development of 2D homojunctions.

         <title>Diffusive and Drift Halide Perovskite Memristive Barristors as Nociceptive and Synaptic Emulators for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide perovskite memristive barristors (diodes with variable Schottky barriers) portraying tunable diffusive dynamics and ionic drift as nociceptive and synaptic emulators for neuromorphic sensory signal computing are experimentally demonstrated. Poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate interfaces promote diffusive kinetics while NiOx interfaces support drift kinetics with CH3NH3PbBr3 as the switching matrix, resulting in modulatable diffusive and drift memristors respectively.








Abstract
With the current research impetus on neuromorphic computing hardware, realizing efficient drift and diffusive memristors are considered critical milestones for the implementation of readout layers, selectors, and frameworks in deep learning and reservoir computing networks. Current demonstrations are predominantly limited to oxide insulators with a soft breakdown behavior. While organic ionotronic electrochemical materials offer an attractive alternative, their implementations thus far have been limited to features exploiting ionic drift a.k.a. drift memristor technology. Development of diffusive memristors with organic electrochemical materials is still at an early stage, and modulation of their switching dynamics remains unexplored. Here, halide perovskite (HP) memristive barristors (diodes with variable Schottky barriers) portraying tunable diffusive dynamics and ionic drift are proposed and experimentally demonstrated. An ion permissive poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate interface that promotes diffusive kinetics and an ion source nickel oxide (NiOx) interface that supports drift kinetics are identified to design diffusive and drift memristors, respectively, with methylammonuim lead bromide (CH3NH3PbBr3) as the switching matrix. In line with the recent interest on developing artificial afferent nerves as information channels bridging sensors and artificial neural networks, these HP memristive barristors are fashioned as nociceptive and synaptic emulators for neuromorphic sensory signal computing.

&lt;/i&gt;) interface that supports drift kinetics are identified to design diffusive and drift memristors, respectively, with methylammonuim lead bromide (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) as the switching matrix. In line with the recent interest on developing artificial afferent nerves as information channels bridging sensors and artificial neural networks, these HP memristive barristors are fashioned as nociceptive and synaptic emulators for neuromorphic sensory signal computing.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Efficient and Stable Red Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Operational Stability &gt;300 h</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermodynamically stable &#946;&#8208;CsPbI3 nanocrystals are prepared, and they are demonstrated to function as a stable, efficient red&#8208;emitting layer. With incorporation of poly(maleic anhydride&#8208;alt&#8208;1&#8208;octadecene), the &#946;&#8208;CsPbI3 further exhibits reduced deep defects of PbCs, increased exciton binding energy, and reduced longitudinal&#8208;optical phonon energy. Red&#8208;emitting perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) based on &#946;&#8208;CsPbI3 achieve both high external quantum efficiency and superior operational stability.








Abstract
The long&#8208;term operational stability of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs), especially red PeLEDs with only several hours typically, has always faced great challenges. Stable &#946;&#8208;CsPbI3 nanocrystals (NCs) are demonstrated for highly efficient and stable red&#8208;emitting PeLEDs through incorporation of poly(maleic anhydride&#8208;alt&#8208;1&#8208;octadecene) (PMA) in synthesizing the NCs. The PMA can chemically interact with PbI2 in the precursors via the coupling effect between O groups in PMA and Pb2+ to favor crystallization of stable &#946;&#8208;CsPbI3 NCs. Meanwhile, the cross&#8208;linked PMA significantly reduces the PbCs anti&#8208;site defect on the surface of the &#946;&#8208;CsPbI3 NCs. Benefiting from the improved crystal phase quality, the photoluminescence quantum yield for &#946;&#8208;CsPbI3 NCs films remarkably increases from 34% to 89%. The corresponding red&#8208;emitting PeLEDs achieves a high external quantum efficiency of 17.8% and superior operational stability with the lifetime, the time to half the initial electroluminescence intensity (T50) reaching 317 h at a constant current density of 30&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Trap Energy Upconversion&#8208;Like Near&#8208;Infrared to Near&#8208;Infrared Light Rejuvenateable Persistent Luminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new paradigm of trap energy upconversion&#8208;like near&#8208;infrared (NIR) to NIR light rejuvenateable persistent luminescence in bismuth&#8208;doped calcium stannate phosphors and nanoparticles is reported. These materials enable the occurrence of a reversed transition of the carriers from a deep&#8208;level energy trap to a shallow&#8208;level trap upon excitation by low&#8208;energy NIR photons. Thus they can be charged circularly via deep&#8208;tissue penetrable NIR photons.








Abstract
Persistent&#8208;luminescence phosphors (PLPs) have a wide variety of applications in the fields of photonics and biophotonics due to their ultralong afterglow lifetime. However, the existing PLPs are charged and recharged with short&#8208;wavelength high&#8208;energy photons or inconvenient and potentially risky X&#8208;ray beams. To date, deep tissue penetrable NIR light has mainly been used for photostimulated afterglow emission, which continues to decay and weaken after each cycle, Herein, a new paradigm of trap energy upconversion&#8208;like near&#8208;infrared (NIR) to near&#8208;infrared light rejuvenateable persistent luminescence in bismuth&#8208;doped calcium stannate phosphors and nanoparticles is reported. In contrast to the existing PLPs and persistent&#8208;luminescence nanoparticles, the materials enable the occurrence of a reversed transition of the carriers from a deep&#8208;level energy trap to a shallow&#8208;level trap upon excitation by low&#8208;energy NIR photons. Thus these new materials can be charged circularly via deep&#8208;tissue penetrable NIR photons, which is unable to be done for existing PLPs, and emit afterglow signals. This conceptual work will lay the foundation to design new categories of NIR&#8208;absorptive&#8211;NIR&#8208;emissive PLPs and nanoparticles featuring physically harmless and deep tissue penetrable NIR light renewability and sets the stage for numerous biological applications, which have been limited by current materials.

         <title>Stable Unbiased Photo&#8208;Electrochemical Overall Water Splitting Exceeding 3% Efficiency via Covalent Triazine Framework/Metal Oxide Hybrid Photoelectrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rationally designed covalent triazine frameworks are conformably deposited on both photocathodes and photoanodes, successfully addressing the trade&#8208;off between stability and efficiency of photoelectrodes for photo&#8208;electrochemical water splitting. Coupling organic semiconductors with inorganic photoelectrodes could be a feasible means for practical photo&#8208;electrochemical water splitting.








Abstract
Photo&#8208;electrochemical (PEC) water splitting systems using oxide&#8208;based photoelectrodes are highly attractive for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion. However, despite decades&#8208;long efforts, it is still challenging to develop efficient and stable photoelectrodes for practical applications. Here, thin layers of covalent triazine frameworks (CTF&#8208;BTh) containing a bithiophene moiety are conformably deposited onto the surfaces of a Cu2O photocathode and a Mo&#8208;doped BiVO4 photoanode via electropolymerization to construct new hybrid photoelectrodes, successfully addressing the efficiency and stability issues. The CTF&#8208;BTh possesses a suitable band structure to form favorable band edge alignment with each metal oxide, creating a p&#8211;n junction and a staggered type&#8208;II heterojunction with Cu2O and Mo&#8208;doped BiVO4, respectively. Thus, the as&#8208;fabricated hybrid photoelectrodes exhibit substantially increased PEC performances. Meanwhile, the CTF&#8208;BTh film also serves as an effective corrosion&#8208;resistant overlayer for both photoelectrodes to inhibit photocorrosion and enable long&#8208;term operation for 150 h with only &#8776;10% loss in photocurrent densities. Furthermore, a stand&#8208;alone unbiased PEC tandem device comprising CTF&#8208;BTh&#8208;coated photoelectrodes exhibits 3.70% solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency. Even after continuous operation for 120 h, the efficiency can still retain at 3.24%.

         <title>Thermoregulating Separators Based on Phase&#8208;Change Materials for Safe Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally self&#8208;regulating separators are designed and fabricated to enhance the safety of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) through a nanoscale incorporation route, whereby a phase&#8208;change material capable of thermal storage is encapsulated coaxially into polymeric nanofibers. Such an unusual separator can alleviate the internal heat accumulation and temperature rise inside LIBs even under abuse conditions.








Abstract
Safety issues in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have aroused great interest owing to their wide applications, from miniaturized devices to large&#8208;scale storage plants. Separators are a vital component to ensure the safety of LIBs; they prevent direct electric contact between the cathode and anode while allowing ion transport. In this study, the first design is reported for a thermoregulating separator that responds to heat stimuli. The separator with a phase&#8208;change material (PCM) of paraffin wax encapsulated in hollow polyacrylonitrile nanofibers renders a wide range of enthalpy (0&#8211;135.3 J g&#8722;1), capable of alleviating the internal temperature rise of LIBs in a timely manner. Under abuse conditions, the generated heat in batteries stimulates the melting of the encapsulated PCM, which absorbs large amounts of heat without creating a significant rise in temperature. Experimental simulation of the inner short&#8208;circuit in prototype pouch cells through nail penetration demonstrates that the PCM&#8208;based separator can effectively suppress the temperature rise due to cell failure. Meanwhile, a cell penetrated by a nail promptly cools down to room temperature within 35 s, benefiting from the latent heat&#8208;storage of the unique PCM separator. The present design of separators featuring latent heat&#8208;storage provides effective strategies for overheat protection and enhanced safety of LIBs.

Such an unusual separator can alleviate the internal heat accumulation and temperature rise inside LIBs even under abuse conditions.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safety issues in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have aroused great interest owing to their wide applications, from miniaturized devices to large&#8208;scale storage plants. Separators are a vital component to ensure the safety of LIBs; they prevent direct electric contact between the cathode and anode while allowing ion transport. In this study, the first design is reported for a thermoregulating separator that responds to heat stimuli. The separator with a phase&#8208;change material (PCM) of paraffin wax encapsulated in hollow polyacrylonitrile nanofibers renders a wide range of enthalpy (0&#8211;135.3 J g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), capable of alleviating the internal temperature rise of LIBs in a timely manner. Under abuse conditions, the generated heat in batteries stimulates the melting of the encapsulated PCM, which absorbs large amounts of heat without creating a significant rise in temperature. Experimental simulation of the inner short&#8208;circuit in prototype pouch cells through nail penetration demonstrates that the PCM&#8208;based separator can effectively suppress the temperature rise due to cell failure. Meanwhile, a cell penetrated by a nail promptly cools down to room temperature within 35 s, benefiting from the latent heat&#8208;storage of the unique PCM separator. The present design of separators featuring latent heat&#8208;storage provides effective strategies for overheat protection and enhanced safety of LIBs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Robust Superamphiphilic Membrane with a Closed&#8208;Loop Life Cycle</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new generation of biobased superamphiphilic vitrimer epoxy resin membranes to separate oil and water efficiently is reported. Similar to classical epoxy resins, this membrane shows strong mechanical robustness and sustains exposure to aqua regia and sodium hydroxide solutions. Furthermore, the blocked membrane can be easily recovered when contaminated with mixed foulants by using dynamic transesterification reactions.








Abstract
Oil&#8208;spill remediation is an international environmental challenge, and superamphiphilic membranes, as a promising solution, have recently drawn lots of attention. However, the robustness of the conventional membrane design is less satisfying under severe conditions during practical applications. Additionally, it is unavoidable for the membranes to face a series of foulants in their practical working environment, for example, algae and sand. These foulants will block the membrane, which leads to a new economic and environmental problem in terms of waste management at the end of their life. To address the aforementioned challenges, a new generation of superamphiphilic vitrimer epoxy resin membranes (SAVER) to separate oil and water efficiently is reported. Similar to classical epoxy resins, SAVER shows strong mechanical robustness and sustains exposure to aqua regia and sodium hydroxide solutions. Furthermore, the blocked membrane can be easily recovered when contaminated with mixed foulants by using dynamic transesterification reactions in the polymer network. The ease with which biobased SAVER can be manufactured, used, recycled, and re&#8208;used without losing value points to new directions in designing a closed&#8208;loop superamphiphilic membrane life cycle.

         <title>A Fluorescent Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Food Real&#8208;Time Visual Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart color&#8208;variation evaluation system based on a fluorescent metal&#8211;organic framework probe and smartphone&#8208;based portable device is designed for on&#8208;site inspection of food quality. The freshness of raw fish samples can be accurately and monitored in real time by the naked eye by the clearly distinguishable color transition from orange red to green.








Abstract
Due to increasing food&#8208;safety issues, exploiting efficient approaches for food quality assessment and instrumentation has attracted concerns worldwide. Herein, a smart evaluation system based on a fluorescent metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) is developed for real&#8208;time visual monitoring of food freshness. Via post&#8208;synthetic modification, a ratiometric fluorescent MOF probe is constructed by covalently coupling fluorescein 5&#8208;isothiocyanate (5&#8208;FITC) with NH2&#8208;rich lanthanide MOF. The probes exhibit a dual&#8208;emissive&#8208;responsive to biogenic amine, resulting in an increase in FITC emission along with a decrease in Eu3+ emission accompanied by a clear distinguishable color transition from orange red to green. After doping the probes on a flexible substrate, the obtained MOF composite film can be integrated with a smartphone&#8208;based portable platform easily. It is proved that this smart evaluation system can be used for on&#8208;site inspection of the freshness of raw fish samples. This work develops a fluorescent MOF&#8208;based smart evaluation system as a novel platform for application in food monitoring, which not only has enormous economic value but also holds great public health significance.

         <title>General Design Methodology for Organic Eutectic Electrolytes toward High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general formation mechanism of organic eutectic electrolytes is developed to enable highly concentrated eutectic electrolytes for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density redox flow batteries (RFBs). Organic molecules containing carbonyl, nitroxyl radical, and methoxy groups are essential to achieve eutectic systems. Furthermore, over threefold enhancement in solubility is achieved for the methoxy&#8208;modified ferrocene derivative, exhibiting good cycling stability and high energy density (188&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8208;1) in solvent&#8208;free conditions.








Abstract
By virtue of strong molecular interactions, eutectic electrolytes provide highly concentrated redox&#8208;active materials without other auxiliary solvents, hence achieving high volumetric capacities and energy density for redox flow batteries (RFBs). However, it is critical to unveil the underlying mechanism in this system, which will be undoubtedly beneficial for their future research on high&#8208;energy storage systems. Herein, a general formation mechanism of organic eutectic electrolytes (OEEs) is developed, and it is found that molecules with specific functional groups such as carbonyl (C&#63742;O), nitroxyl radical (N&#63743;O&#8226;), and methoxy (OCH3) groups can coordinate with alkali metal fluorinated sulfonylimide salts (especially for bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide, TFSI), thereby forming OEEs. Molecular designs further demonstrate that the redox&#8208;inactive methoxy group functionalized ferrocene derivative maintains the liquid OEE at both reduced and oxidized states. Over threefold increase in solubility is obtained (2.8 m for ferrocene derivative OEE) and high actual discharge energy density of 188&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8208;1 (75% of the theoretical value) is achieved in the Li hybrid cell. The established mechanism presents new ways of designing desirable electrolytes through molecular interactions for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density organic RFBs.

         <title>Tunable Linearity of High&#8208;Performance Vertical Dual&#8208;Gate vdW Phototransistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vertical dual&#8208;gate van der Waals (vdW) phototransistors are fabricated based on ambipolar WSe2. With the tunability of the opposite dual&#8208;gating, a linear photoresponse can be obtained with a high responsivity and low noise level, resulting in a high detectivity. The linear photoresponse with high performance of these phototransistors offers the possibility of achieving high&#8208;resolution and quantitative light detection with layered 2D semiconductors.








Abstract
Layered 2D semiconductors have been widely exploited in photodetectors due to their excellent electronic and optoelectronic properties. To improve their performance, photogating, photoconductive, photovoltaic, photothermoelectric, and other effects have been used in phototransistors and photodiodes made with 2D semiconductors or hybrid structures. However, it is difficult to achieve the desired high responsivity and linear photoresponse simultaneously in a monopolar conduction channel or a p&#8211;n junction. Here, dual&#8208;channel conduction with ambipolar multilayer WSe2 is presented by employing the device concept of dual&#8208;gate phototransistor, where p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type channels are produced in the same semiconductor using opposite dual&#8208;gating. It is possible to tune the photoconductive gain using a vertical electric field, so that the gain is constant with respect to the light intensity&#8212;a linear photoresponse, with a high responsivity of &#8776;2.5 &#215; 104 A W&#8722;1. Additionally, the 1/f noise of the device is kept at a low level under the opposite dual&#8208;gating due to the reduction of current and carrier fluctuation, resulting in a high detectivity of &#8776;2 &#215; 1013 Jones in the linear photoresponse regime. The linear photoresponse and high performance of the dual&#8208;gate WSe2 phototransistor offer the possibility of achieving high&#8208;resolution and quantitative light detection with layered 2D semiconductors.

         <title>Tin Oxide Electron&#8208;Selective Layers for Efficient, Stable, and Scalable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Notable developments of SnO2 as an electron&#8208;selective layer for efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are reviewed, along with an overview of the fabrication methods and interfacial passivation routes. Furthermore, techno&#8208;economic and toxicology analyses of SnO2 are discussed for possible large&#8208;scale deployment of PSCs. Finally, the role of SnO2 in scaled module and tandem solar cell production is revealed.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have become a promising photovoltaic (PV) technology, where the evolution of the electron&#8208;selective layers (ESLs), an integral part of any PV device, has played a distinctive role to their progress. To date, the mesoporous titanium dioxide (TiO2)/compact TiO2 stack has been among the most used ESLs in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PSCs. However, this material requires high&#8208;temperature sintering and may induce hysteresis under operational conditions, raising concerns about its use toward commercialization. Recently, tin oxide (SnO2) has emerged as an attractive alternative ESL, thanks to its wide bandgap, high optical transmission, high carrier mobility, suitable band alignment with perovskites, and decent chemical stability. Additionally, its low&#8208;temperature processability enables compatibility with temperature&#8208;sensitive substrates, and thus flexible devices and tandem solar cells. Here, the notable developments of SnO2 as a perovskite&#8208;relevant ESL are reviewed with emphasis placed on the various fabrication methods and interfacial passivation routes toward champion solar cells with high stability. Further, a techno&#8208;economic analysis of SnO2 materials for large&#8208;scale deployment, together with a processing&#8208;toxicology assessment, is presented. Finally, a perspective on how SnO2 materials can be instrumental in successful large&#8208;scale module and perovskite&#8208;based tandem solar cell manufacturing is provided.

         <title>A Dendrite&#8208;Free Tin Anode for High&#8208;Energy Aqueous Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal anode based on the Sn(OH)62&#8722;/Sn redox couple at &#8722;0.921 V vs standard hydrogen electrode is reported. In contrast to severe Zn dendrites, Sn metal prefers isotropic crystal growth without dendrites, leading to superior performance in lifespan and areal capacity in Sn&#8211;I cells. The Sn anode represents a promising electrode candidate for metal&#8208;based rechargeable aqueous batteries.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;based aqueous redox flow batteries (ARFBs) such as zinc&#8208;based ARFBs have attracted remarkable attention owing to their intrinsic high energy density. However, severe dendrite issues limit their efficiency and lifespan. Here an aqueous metal anode operating between Sn(OH)62&#8722; (stannate) and metal Sn is presented, providing a reversible four&#8208;electron transfer at &#8722;0.921 V vs standard hydrogen electrode. In strong contrast to severe Zn dendrites, the Sn(OH)62&#8722;/Sn electrode shows smooth and dendrite&#8208;free morphology, which can be attributed to its intrinsic low&#8208;surface&#8208;energy anisotropy which facilitates isotropic crystal growth of Sn metal. By coupling with iodide/tri&#8208;iodide (I&#8722;/I3&#8722;), the static Sn&#8211;I cell demonstrates a stable cycling for 500 cycles (more than 2 months). In contrast, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Zn anode suffers from serious dendrites and lasts less than 45 cycles (190 h) in Zn&#8211;I cells. A stable continuous flow cycling of Sn&#8211;I cell achieves a Sn areal capacity of 73.07 mAh cm&#8722;2 at an average discharge voltage of 1.3 V for 350 h. The alkaline Sn electrode demonstrates dendrite&#8208;free morphology and superior performance in cycle life and areal capacity compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Zn metal anodes, offering a promising metal anode for high&#8208;energy ARFBs and other metal&#8208;based rechargeable aqueous batteries.

         <title>Colorful Efficient Moir&#233;&#8208;Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A moir&#233; interference structure augments light&#8208;diffraction channels, leading to elongated optical paths, and &#8220;folds&#8221; sunlight into the perovskite layer. Besides, the sets of moir&#233; diffracted light achieve &#8220;1 + 1 = 3&#8221; comparing to the single diffraction grating. Therefore, moir&#233; perovskite solar cells are constructed by way of a commercial DVD disc, resulting in a champion efficiency up to 20.17% (MAPbI3) and 21.76% ((FAPbI3)1&#8208;x(MAPbBr3)x).








Abstract
Light harvesting is crucial for thin&#8208;film solar cells. To substantially reduce optical loss in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), hierarchical light&#8208;trapping nano&#8208;architectures enable absorption enhancement to exceed the conventional upper limit and have great potential for achieving state&#8208;of&#8208;the art optoelectronic performances. However, it remains a great challenge to design and fabricate a superior hierarchical light&#8208;trapping nano&#8208;architecture, which exhibits extraordinary light&#8208;harvesting ability and simultaneously avoids deteriorating the electrical performance of PSCs. Herein, colorful efficient moir&#233;&#8208;PSCs are designed and fabricated incorporating moir&#233; interference structures by the imprinting method with the aid of a commercial DVD disc. It is experimentally and theoretically demonstrated that the light harvesting ability of the moir&#233; interference structure can be well manipulated through changing the rotation angle (0&#176;&#8211;90&#176;). The boosted short&#8208;circuit current is credited to augment light diffraction channels, leading to elongated optical paths, and fold sunlight into the perovskite layer. Moreover, the imprinting process suppresses the trap sites and voids at the active&#8208;layer interfaces with eliminated hysteresis. The moir&#233;&#8208;PSC with an optimized 30&#176; rotation angle achieves the best enhancement of light harvesting (28.5% higher than the pristine), resulting in efficiencies over 20.17% (MAPbI3) and 21.76% ((FAPbI3)1&#8208;x (MAPbBr3)x).

         <title>A &#916;E&#160;= 0.63 V Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalyst Enables High&#8208;Rate and Long&#8208;Cycling Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrahigh bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction and evolution is achieved with the indicator &#916;E&#160;= 0.63&#160;V, far exceeding the noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based benchmark and most reported electrocatalysts. Corresponding rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries afford ultralong lifespan over 3600 cycles at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and ultrahigh cycling current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries constitute promising next&#8208;generation energy storage devices due to their intrinsic safety, low cost, and feasibility to realize high cycling current density and long cycling lifespan. Nevertheless, their cathodic reactions involving oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution are highly sluggish in kinetics, requiring high&#8208;performance noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free bifunctional electrocatalysts that exceed the current noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based benchmarks. Herein, a noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free bifunctional electrocatalyst is fabricated, which demonstrates ultrahigh bifunctional activity and renders excellent performance in rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries. Concretely, atomic Co&#8211;N&#8211;C and NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are respectively selected as oxygen reduction and evolution active sites and are further rationally integrated to afford the resultant CoNC@LDH composite electrocatalyst. The CoNC@LDH electrocatalyst exhibits remarkable bifunctional activity delivering an indicator &#916;E of 0.63&#160;V, far exceeding the noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based Pt/C+Ir/C benchmark (&#916;E = 0.77&#160;V) and most reported electrocatalysts. Correspondingly, ultralong lifespan (over 3600 cycles at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and excellent rate performances (cycling current density at 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) are achieved in rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Ultrahigh bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction and evolution is achieved with the indicator &#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;&#160;= 0.63&#160;V, far exceeding the noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based benchmark and most reported electrocatalysts. Corresponding rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries afford ultralong lifespan over 3600 cycles at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and ultrahigh cycling current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries constitute promising next&#8208;generation energy storage devices due to their intrinsic safety, low cost, and feasibility to realize high cycling current density and long cycling lifespan. Nevertheless, their cathodic reactions involving oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution are highly sluggish in kinetics, requiring high&#8208;performance noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free bifunctional electrocatalysts that exceed the current noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based benchmarks. Herein, a noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free bifunctional electrocatalyst is fabricated, which demonstrates ultrahigh bifunctional activity and renders excellent performance in rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries. Concretely, atomic Co&#8211;N&#8211;C and NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are respectively selected as oxygen reduction and evolution active sites and are further rationally integrated to afford the resultant CoNC@LDH composite electrocatalyst. The CoNC@LDH electrocatalyst exhibits remarkable bifunctional activity delivering an indicator &lt;b&gt;&#916;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; of 0.63&#160;V, far exceeding the noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based Pt/C&lt;b&gt;+&lt;/b&gt;Ir/C benchmark (&lt;b&gt;&#916;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; 
&lt;b&gt;=&lt;/b&gt; 0.77&#160;V) and most reported electrocatalysts. Correspondingly, ultralong lifespan (over 3600 cycles at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and excellent rate performances (cycling current density at 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) are achieved in rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries. This work highlights the current advances of bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis and endows high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;cycling rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries for efficient sustainable energy storage.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Near Unit Internal Quantum Efficiency at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature high&#8208;efficiency light&#8208;emitting diodes based on metal halide perovskite FAPbI3 can work perfectly at low temperatures. A peak external quantum efficiency of 32.8%, corresponding to an internal quantum efficiency of 100%, is achieved at 45&#160;K. Importantly, the device shows almost no degradation after working at a constant current density of 200&#160;mA&#160;m&#8722;2 for 330&#160;h.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature&#8208;high&#8208;efficiency light&#8208;emitting diodes based on metal halide perovskite FAPbI3 are shown to be able to work perfectly at low temperatures. A peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 32.8%, corresponding to an internal quantum efficiency of 100%, is achieved at 45&#160;K. Importantly, the devices show almost no degradation after working at a constant current density of 200&#160;mA&#160;m&#8722;2 for 330&#160;h. The enhanced EQEs at low temperatures result from the increased photoluminescence quantum efficiencies of the perovskite, which is caused by the increased radiative recombination rate. Spectroscopic and calculation results suggest that the phase transitions of the FAPbI3 play an important role for the enhancement of exciton binding energy, which increases the recombination rate.

         <title>Mimicking Nature's Butterflies: Electrochromic Devices with Dual&#8208;Sided Differential Colorations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Janus&#8208;structured electrochromic devices are evolved from traditional electrochromic structures by inserting an optically thin (4&#8211;8 nm) metallic layer with&#160;complex refractive index. These unique differentially colored devices are used to mimick the butterfly Kallima inachus, which closely resembles a dry leaf when its wings are close and exhibits various bright colors when its wings are open.








Abstract
Some butterfly species such as the orange oakleaf (Kallima inachus) have strikingly different colors on the dorsal (front) sides of their wings compared to those on the ventral (back) sides of their wings, which helps camouflage the butterflies from predators and attract potential mates. However, few human&#8208;made materials, devices, and technologies can mimic such differential coloring for a long time. Here, a new type of Janus&#8208;structured two&#8208;sided electrochromic device is developed that, upon application of different voltages, exhibits a coloration state on one side that is distinctly different from that on the other side. This is achieved by inserting an optically thin (4&#8211;8 nm) metallic layer with a complex refractive index, such as a layer composed of tungsten, titanium, copper or silver, into typical electrochromic structures.

         <title>Supramolecular Pins with Ultralong Efficient Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to intramolecular charge transfer enhanced by cucurbit[8]uril, a supramolecular pin shows afterglow with high phosphorescence quantum yield (99.38%) after incorporation into a rigid matrix, which is the highest yield reported to date for phosphorescent materials. Moreover, supramolecular pins are applied for targeted phosphorescence imaging of mitochondria.








Abstract
Constructing ultralong organic phosphorescent materials possessing a high quantum yield is challenging. Herein, assemblies of purely organic supramolecular pins composed of alkyl&#8208;bridged phenylpyridinium salts and cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) are reported. Different from &#8220;one host with two guests&#8221; and &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; binding, the binding formation of supramolecular pins is &#8220;one host with one guest&#8221; and &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;head,&#8221; which overcomes electrostatic repulsion and promotes intramolecular charge transfer. The supramolecular pin 1/CB[8] displays afterglow with high phosphorescence quantum yield (99.38%) after incorporation into a rigid matrix, which is the highest yield reported to date for phosphorescent materials. Moreover, multicolor photoluminescence can be obtained by different excitation wavelengths and ratios of host to guest. Owing to the redshift of the absorption, the supramolecular pins are applied for targeted phosphorescence imaging of mitochondria. This work will provide a reasonable supramolecular strategy to achieve redshifted and efficient phosphorescence both in the solid state and in aqueous solution.

         <dc:description>
A novel Al1.5Co4Fe2Cr multiprincipal element alloy with ultrafine ferromagnetic body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (BCC) coherent nanoprecipitates in a B2 matrix is developed via tuning the chemical composition to manipulate the microstructure. It exhibits a prominent soft&#8208;magnetic property, high Curie temperature, and electrical resistivity, apparently attributable to the excellent stability of the coherent microstructure. The current approach offers a new way to design high&#8208;performance soft&#8208;magnetic alloys for high&#8208;temperature applications.








Abstract
Multiprincipal&#8208;element alloys (MPEAs), including high&#8208;entropy alloys, are a new class of materials whose thermodynamical properties are mainly driven by configuration entropy, rather than enthalpy in the traditional alloys, especially at high temperatures. Herein, the design of a novel soft&#8208;magnetic nonequiatomic, quaternary MPEA is described, via tuning its chemical composition to deliberately manipulate its microstructure, such that it contains ultrafine ferromagnetic body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (BCC) coherent nanoprecipitates (3&#8211;7&#160;nm) uniformly distributed in a B2&#8208;phase matrix. The new alloy Al1.5Co4Fe2Cr exhibits high saturation magnetization (MS&#160;= 135.3 emu g&#8208;1), low coercivity (HC&#160;= 127.3 A m&#8208;1), high Curie temperature (TC&#160;= 1061 K), and high electrical resistivity (&#961;&#160; =&#160;244 &#956;&#937; cm), promising for soft magnets. More importantly, these prominent soft&#8208;magnetic properties are observed to be retained even after the alloy is thermally exposed at 873 K for 555 h, apparently attributable to the excellent stability of the coherent microstructure. The versatility of the magnetic properties of this new alloy is discussed in light of the microstructural change induced by tuning the chemical composition, and the enhanced performance of the alloy is compared directly with that of the traditional soft&#8208;magnetic alloys. The perspective is also addressed to design high&#8208;performance soft&#8208;magnetic alloys for high&#8208;temperature applications.

The new alloy Al&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cr exhibits high saturation magnetization (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;= 135.3 emu g&lt;sup&gt;&#8208;1&lt;/sup&gt;), low coercivity (&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;= 127.3 A m&lt;sup&gt;&#8208;1&lt;/sup&gt;), high Curie temperature (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;= 1061 K), and high electrical resistivity (&#961;&#160; =&#160;244 &#956;&#937; cm), promising for soft magnets. More importantly, these prominent soft&#8208;magnetic properties are observed to be retained even after the alloy is thermally exposed at 873 K for 555 h, apparently attributable to the excellent stability of the coherent microstructure. The versatility of the magnetic properties of this new alloy is discussed in light of the microstructural change induced by tuning the chemical composition, and the enhanced performance of the alloy is compared directly with that of the traditional soft&#8208;magnetic alloys. The perspective is also addressed to design high&#8208;performance soft&#8208;magnetic alloys for high&#8208;temperature applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>In Situ Tracking of Wetting&#8208;Front Transient Heat Release on a Surface&#8208;Mounted Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile capillary&#8208;driven liquid&#8208;imbibition approach is developed for in situ tracking of transient heat release at the wetting front of surface&#8208;mounted metal&#8211;organic frameworks (SURMOFs) on cellulosic fiber papers. As a potential disruption to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in trace&#8208;solvent detection technologies, the study shows promise for the integration of SURMOFs in future sensor devices.








Abstract
Transient heat generation during guest adsorption and host&#8211;guest interactions is a natural phenomenon in metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) chemistry. However, in situ tracking of such MOF released heat is an insufficiently researched field due to the fast heat dissipation to the surroundings. Herein, a facile capillary&#8208;driven liquid&#8208;imbibition approach is developed for in situ tracking of transient heat release at the wetting front of surface&#8208;mounted MOFs (SURMOFs) on cellulosic fiber substrates. Spatiotemporal temperature distributions are obtained with infrared thermal imaging for a range of MOF&#8208;based substrates and imbibed liquids. Temperature rises at the wetting front of water and binary mixtures with organic solvents are found to be over 10&#160;K with an ultrafast and distinguishable thermal signal response (&lt;1 s) with a detectable concentration limit &#8804;1 wt%. As an advancement to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in trace&#8208;solvent detection technologies, this study shows great prospects for the integration of SURMOFs in future sensor devices. Inspired by this prototypal study, SURMOF&#8208;based transient heat signal transduction is likely to be extended to an ever&#8208;expanding library of SURMOFs and other classes of surface&#8208;grafted porous materials, translating into a wide range of convenient, portable, and ubiquitous sensor devices.

         <title>Frequency&#8208;Independent Terahertz Anomalous Hall Effect in DyCo5, Co32Fe68, and Gd27Fe73 Thin Films from DC to 40 THz</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is a fundamental spintronic phenomenon that is a potentially essential ingredient of future high&#8208;speed spintronic devices operating at terahertz (THz) frequencies. It is revealed that the AHE remains operative from DC up to 40 THz with a flat frequency response in thin films of three technologically relevant magnetic materials: DyCo5, Co32Fe68, and Gd27Fe73.








Abstract
The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is a fundamental spintronic charge&#8208;to&#8208;charge&#8208;current conversion phenomenon and closely related to spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge&#8208;current conversion by the spin Hall effect. Future high&#8208;speed spintronic devices will crucially rely on such conversion phenomena at terahertz (THz) frequencies. Here, it is revealed that the AHE remains operative from DC up to 40 THz with a flat frequency response in thin films of three technologically relevant magnetic materials: DyCo5, Co32Fe68, and Gd27Fe73. The frequency&#8208;dependent conductivity&#8208;tensor elements &#963;xx and &#963;yx&#8197;are&#8197;measured, and good agreement with DC measurements is found. The experimental findings are fully consistent with ab initio calculations of &#963;yx for CoFe and highlight the role of the large Drude scattering rate (&#8776;100&#160;THz) of metal thin films, which smears out any sharp spectral features of the THz AHE. Finally, it is found that the intrinsic contribution to the THz AHE dominates over the extrinsic mechanisms for the Co32Fe68 sample. The results imply that the AHE and related effects such as the spin Hall effect are highly promising ingredients of future THz spintronic devices reliably operating from DC to 40 THz and beyond.

         <title>Fabrication of Quasi&#8208;2D Shape&#8208;Tailored Microparticles using Wettability Contrast&#8208;Based Platforms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thin polymeric films with well&#8208;defined lateral size and geometry are fabricated taking advantage of the wettability contrast of oleophilic&#8211;oleophobic patterned surfaces. Cells mediate the pliability of quasi&#8208;2D films, and their integration in 3D cellular aggregates leads to enhanced cell metabolic activity and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor.








Abstract
The ability to fabricate materials with ultrathin architectures enables the breakthrough of low&#8208;dimensional structures with high surface area that showcase distinctive properties from their bulk counterparts. They are exploited in a wide range of fields, including energy harvesting, catalysis, and biomedicine. Despite such versatility, the fine tuning of the lateral dimensions and geometry of these structures remains challenging. Prepatterned platforms gain significant attention as enabling technologies to process materials with highly controlled shapes and dimensions. Herein, different nanometer&#8208;thick particles of various lateral sizes and geometries (e.g., squares, circles, triangles, hexagons) are processed with high precision and definition, taking advantage of the wettability contrast of oleophilic&#8211;oleophobic patterned surfaces. Quasi&#8208;2D polymeric microparticles with high shape&#8208; and size&#8208;fidelity can be retrieved as freestanding objects in a single step. These structures show cell&#8208;mediated pliability, and their integration in gravity&#8208;enforced human adipose&#8208;derived stem cell spheroids leads to an enhanced metabolic activity and a modulated secretion of proangiogenic factors.

         <title>Photodriven Transient Picosecond Top&#8208;Layer Semiconductor to Metal Phase&#8208;Transition in p&#8208;Doped Molybdenum Disulfide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface S&#8211;Mo&#8211;S sheet of the p&#8208;doped indirect semiconductor 2H&#8208;MoS2 is found to undergo a transient 1T&#8208;MoS2&#8208;metallization of the surface layer by optical excitation with distinct threshold and saturation behaviour. This finding builds on the essential sensitivity of time&#8208;resolved electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis with tuneable synchrotron radiation.








Abstract
Visible light is shown to create a transient metallic S&#8211;Mo&#8211;S surface layer on bulk semiconducting p&#8208;doped indirect&#8208;bandgap 2H&#8208;MoS2. Optically created electron&#8211;hole pairs separate in the surface band bending region of the p&#8208;doped semiconducting crystal causing a transient accumulation of electrons in the surface region. This triggers a reversible 2H&#8208;semiconductor to 1T&#8208;metal phase&#8208;transition of the surface layer. Electron&#8211;phonon coupling of the indirect&#8208;bandgap p&#8208;doped 2H&#8208;MoS2 enables this efficient pathway even at a low density of excited electrons with a distinct optical excitation threshold and saturation behavior. This mechanism needs to be taken into consideration when describing the surface properties of illuminated p&#8208;doped 2H&#8208;MoS2. In particular, light&#8208;induced increased charge mobility and surface activation can cause and enhance the photocatalytic and photoassisted electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction of water on 2H&#8208;MoS2. Generally, it opens up for a way to control not only the surface of p&#8208;doped 2H&#8208;MoS2 but also related dichalcogenides and layered systems. The findings are based on the sensitivity of time&#8208;resolved electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis with photon&#8208;energy&#8208;tuneable synchrotron&#160;radiation.

&lt;p&gt;The surface S&#8211;Mo&#8211;S sheet of the p&#8208;doped indirect semiconductor 2H&#8208;MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is found to undergo a transient 1T&#8208;MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;metallization of the surface layer by optical excitation with distinct threshold and saturation behaviour. This finding builds on the essential sensitivity of time&#8208;resolved electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis with tuneable synchrotron radiation.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visible light is shown to create a transient metallic S&#8211;Mo&#8211;S surface layer on bulk semiconducting p&#8208;doped indirect&#8208;bandgap 2H&#8208;MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Optically created electron&#8211;hole pairs separate in the surface band bending region of the p&#8208;doped semiconducting crystal causing a transient accumulation of electrons in the surface region. This triggers a reversible 2H&#8208;semiconductor to 1T&#8208;metal phase&#8208;transition of the surface layer. Electron&#8211;phonon coupling of the indirect&#8208;bandgap p&#8208;doped 2H&#8208;MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; enables this efficient pathway even at a low density of excited electrons with a distinct optical excitation threshold and saturation behavior. This mechanism needs to be taken into consideration when describing the surface properties of illuminated p&#8208;doped 2H&#8208;MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In particular, light&#8208;induced increased charge mobility and surface activation can cause and enhance the photocatalytic and photoassisted electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction of water on 2H&#8208;MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Generally, it opens up for a way to control not only the surface of p&#8208;doped 2H&#8208;MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; but also related dichalcogenides and layered systems. The findings are based on the sensitivity of time&#8208;resolved electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis with photon&#8208;energy&#8208;tuneable synchrotron&#160;radiation.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Harnessing Ionic Power from Equilibrium Electrolyte Solution via Photoinduced Active Ion Transport through van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals&#8208;Like Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;dichalcogenide&#8208;based van der Waals multilayer heterostructures are used to harvest ionic power from equilibrium electrolyte solutions via a coupled photon&#8208;carrier&#8211;ion&#8208;transport mechanism. Under optimized conditions, a power density of nearly 2 mW&#160;m&#8211;2 is achieved under one sun equivalent excitation.








Abstract
Nanofluidic ion transport through van der Waals heterostructures, composed of two or more types of reconstructed 2D nanomaterials, gives rise to fascinating opportunities for light&#8208;energy harvesting, due to coupling between the optoelectronic properties of the layered constituents and ion transport in between the atomic layers. Here, a photoinduced active ion transport phenomenon through transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)&#8208;based van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals&#8208;like multilayer heterostructures is reported for harnessing ionic power from equilibrium electrolyte solution. The binary heterostructure comprises sequentially stacked 2D&#8208;WS2 and 2D&#8208;MoS2 multilayers with sub&#8208;1 nm interlayer spacing. Upon visible&#8208;light illumination, a net ionic flow is initiated through the Janus membrane, suggesting a directional cationic transport from WS2 to MoS2 part. The transport mechanism is explained in terms of a photovoltaic effect due to type II band alignment of WS2/MoS2 heterostructures. The driving mechanism can be generally applied to a variety of heterogeneous TMD membranes with type II semiconductor heterojunctions. In equilibrium ionic solutions, the maximum ionic photoresponse approaches &#8776;21 &#181;A&#160;cm&#8211;2 and &#8776;45&#160;mV under one sun equivalent excitation. Under optimized conditions, the harvested power density reaches 2&#160;mW&#160;m&#8211;2. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of photonic&#8208;to&#8208;ionic power generation within angstrom&#8208;scale confinement anticipates potential for light&#8208;controlled ionic circuits, artificial photosynthesis, and biomimetic energy conversion.

         <title>Embolization of Vascular Malformations via In Situ Photocrosslinking of Mechanically Reinforced Alginate Microfibers using an Optical&#8208;Fiber&#8208;Integrated Microfluidic Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;crosslinked alginate&#8208;based hydrogel with tantalum nanopowder is proposed that employs the synergistic effect of covalent crosslinking through visible&#8208;light irradiation and ionic crosslinking by Ca2+ in the blood. Furthermore, an effective strategy to design and produce an optical&#8208;fiber&#8208;integrated microfluidic device that can continuously form hydrogel microfibers by in situ photocrosslinking in extreme endovascular environments is developed.








Abstract
Embolization, which is a minimally invasive endovascular treatment, is a safe and effective procedure for treating vascular malformations (e.g., aneurysms). Hydrogel microfibers obtained via spatiotemporally controllable in situ photocrosslinking exhibit great potential for embolizing aneurysms. However, this process is challenging because of the absence of biocompatible and morphologically stable hydrogels and the difficulty in continuously spinning the microfibers via in situ photocrosslinking in extreme endovascular environments such as those involving a tortuous geometry and high absorbance. A double&#8208;crosslinked alginate&#8208;based hydrogel with tantalum nanopowder (DAT) that exploits the synergistic effect of covalent crosslinking by visible&#8208;light irradiation and ionic crosslinking using Ca2+, which is present in the blood, is developed in this study. Furthermore, an effective strategy to design and produce an optical&#8208;fiber&#8208;integrated microfluidic device (OFI&#8208;MD) that can continuously spin hydrogel microfibers via in situ photocrosslinking in extreme endovascular environments is proposed. As an embolic material, DAT exhibits promising characteristics such as radiopacity, nondissociation, nonswelling, and constant mechanical strength in blood, in addition to excellent cyto&#8208; and hemo&#8208;compatibilities. Using OFI&#8208;MD to spin DAT microfibers continuously can help fill aneurysms safely, uniformly, and completely within the endovascular simulator without generating microscopic fragments, which demonstrates its potential as an effective embolization strategy.

         <title>Selenic Acid Etching Assisted Vacancy Engineering for Designing Highly Active Electrocatalysts toward the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general, selenic&#8208;acid&#8208;assisted etching strategy from a metal&#8211;organic framework as a precursor is developed to realize carbon&#8208;coated 3d metal selenides MmSen (Co0.85Se1&#8722;x, NiSe2&#8722;x, FeSe2&#8208;x) with rich Se vacancies as high&#8208;performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals a mechanism that the introduction of abundant Se vacancies can improve the conductivity and reduce reaction barriers for the formation of intermediates.








Abstract
Oxygen evolution electrocatalysts are central to overall water splitting, and they should meet the requirements of low cost, high activity, high conductivity, and stable performance. Herein, a general, selenic&#8208;acid&#8208;assisted etching strategy is designed from a metal&#8211;organic framework as a precursor to realize carbon&#8208;coated 3d metal selenides MmSen (Co0.85Se1&#8722;x, NiSe2&#8722;x, FeSe2&#8722;x) with rich Se vacancies as high&#8208;performance precious metal&#8208;free oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Specifically, the as&#8208;prepared Co0.85Se1&#8722;x@C nanocages deliver an overpotential of only 231&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for the OER and the corresponding full water&#8208;splitting electrolyzer requires only a cell voltage of 1.49&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 in alkaline media. Density functional theory calculation reveals the important role of abundant Se vacancies for improving the catalytic activity through improving the conductivity and reducing reaction barriers for the formation of intermediates. Although phase change after long&#8208;term operation is observed with the formation of metal hydroxides, catalytic activity is not obviously affected, which strengthens the important role of the carbon network in the operating stability. This study provides a new opportunity to realize high&#8208;performance OER electrocatalysts by a general strategy on selenic acid etching assisted vacancy engineering.

         <title>A Spider&#8208;Silk&#8208;Inspired Wet Adhesive with Supercold Tolerance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spider&#8208;silk&#8208;inspired wet adhesive (SA) composed of polyurethane@poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PU@PVP, core@sheath) nanostructured fibers is fabricated by coaxial electrospinning. The SA achieves robust wet adhesion through a unique dissolving&#8211;wetting&#8211;adhering process of the core&#8211;sheath nanostructured fibers. Furthermore, the SA retains reliable adhesion from 4 to &#8722;196&#160;&#176;C, and even maintains constant adhesion after being stored in liquid nitrogen, showing promising applicability in cryogenic environments.








Abstract
Conventional adhesives often encounter interfacial failure in humid conditions due to small droplets of water condensed on surface, but spider silks can capture prey in such environment. Here a robust spider&#8208;silk&#8208;inspired wet adhesive (SA) composed of core&#8211;sheath nanostructured fibers with hygroscopic adhesive nanosheath (poly(vinylpyrrolidone)) and supporting nanocore (polyurethane) is reported. The wet adhesion of the SA is achieved by a unique dissolving&#8211;wetting&#8211;adhering process of core&#8211;sheath nanostructured fibers, revealed by in situ observations at macro&#8208; and microscales. Further, the SA maintains reliable adhesion on wet and cold substrates from 4 to &#8722;196&#160;&#176;C and even tolerates splashing, violent shaking, and weight loading in liquid nitrogen (&#8722;196&#160;&#176;C), showing promising applicability in cryogenic environments. This study will provide an innovative route to design functional wet adhesives.

         <title>Porous Semiconducting Polymers Enable High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of porous polymer films is fabricated using the efficient breath figure method and their performance in organic electrochemical transistors is investigated. Introducing the porosity significantly enhances the ion penetration rates and results in high transconductance and fast switching properties.








Abstract
Organic polymer electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are of great interest for flexible electronics and bioelectronics applications owing to their high transconductance and low operating voltage. However, efficient OECT operation must delicately balance the seemingly incompatible materials optimizations of redox chemistry, active layer electronic transport, and ion penetration/transport. The latter characteristics are particularly challenging since most high&#8208;mobility semiconducting polymers are hydrophobic, which hinders efficient ion penetration, hence limiting OECT performance. Here, the properties and OECT response of a series of dense and porous semiconducting polymer films are compared, the latter fabricated via a facile breath figure approach. This methodology enables fast ion doping, high transconductance (up to 364 S cm&#8722;1), and a low subthreshold swing for the hydrophobic polymers DPPDTT and P3HT, rivalling or exceeding the metrics of the relatively hydrophilic polymer, Pg2T&#8208;T. Furthermore, the porous morphology also enhances the transconductance of hydrophilic polymers, offering a general strategy for fabricating high&#8208;performance electrochemical transistors.

         <title>Biologically Plausible Artificial Synaptic Array: Replicating Ebbinghaus&#8217; Memory Curve with Selective Attention</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the memorization process of the human brain, an artificial synaptic array is developed, which mimics the biological memorization process by replicating Ebbinghaus&#8217; forgetting curve. To construct the artificial synaptic array, signal&#8208;transmitting access transistors and artificial synaptic memory transistors are designed using indium&#8211;gallium&#8211;zinc&#8208;oxide and poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene), respectively.








Abstract
The nature of repetitive learning and oblivion of memory enables humans to effectively manage vast amounts of memory by prioritizing information for long&#8208;term storage. Inspired by the memorization process of the human brain, an artificial synaptic array is presented, which mimics the biological memorization process by replicating Ebbinghaus&#8217; forgetting curve. To construct the artificial synaptic array, signal&#8208;transmitting access transistors and artificial synaptic memory transistors are designed using indium&#8211;gallium&#8211;zinc&#8208;oxide and poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene), respectively. To secure the desired performance of the access transistor in regulating the input signal to the synaptic transistor, the content of gallium in the access transistor is optimized. In addition, the operation voltage of the synaptic transistor is carefully selected to achieve memory&#8208;state efficiency. Repetitive learning characterizing Ebbinghaus&#8217; oblivion curves is realized using an artificial synaptic array with optimized conditions for both transistor components. This successfully demonstrates a biologically plausible memorization process. Furthermore, selective attention for information prioritization in the human brain is mimicked by selectively applying repetitive learning to a synaptic transistor with a high memory state. The demonstrated biologically plausible artificial synaptic array provides great scope for advancement in bioinspired electronics.

         <title>Infrared Metasurface Augmented by Deep Learning for Monitoring Dynamics between All Major Classes of Biomolecules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metasurfaces have outstanding light manipulation capabilities at the nanoscale, which enable functions beyond what otherwise is seen in nature. In this work, highly sensitive, broadband mid&#8208;IR metasurfaces for spectroscopy are augmented with artificial intelligence to allow the label&#8208;free monitoring of biomolecules from all major classes. This pioneering bioanalytical technology offers unprecedented opportunities for unravelling complex biomolecular processes.








Abstract
Insights into the fascinating molecular world of biological processes are crucial for understanding diseases, developing diagnostics, and effective therapeutics. These processes are complex as they involve interactions between four major classes of biomolecules, i.e., proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids, which makes it important to be able to discriminate between all these different biomolecular species. In this work, a deep learning&#8208;augmented, chemically&#8208;specific nanoplasmonic technique that enables such a feat in a label&#8208;free manner to not disrupt native processes is presented. The method uses a highly sensitive multiresonant plasmonic metasurface in a microfluidic device, which enhances infrared absorption across a broadband mid&#8208;IR spectrum and in water, despite its strongly overlapping absorption bands. The real&#8208;time format of the optofluidic method enables the collection of a vast amount of spectrotemporal data, which allows the construction of a deep neural network to discriminate accurately between all major classes of biomolecules. The capabilities of the new method are demonstrated by monitoring of a multistep bioassay containing sucrose&#8208; and nucleotides&#8208;loaded liposomes interacting with a small, lipid membrane&#8208;perforating peptide. It is envisioned that the presented technology will impact the fields of biology, bioanalytics, and pharmacology from fundamental research and disease diagnostics to drug development.

         <dc:description>
In article number 2006759, Hyung Joon Cha, Joonwon Kim,  and co&#8208;workers develop an optical&#8208;fiber&#8208;integrated microfluidic device that can continuously form hydrogel microfibers via in situ photo&#8208;crosslinking in extreme endovascular environments. The hydrogel microfibers are based on a double&#8208;crosslinked alginate that employs the dityrosine bond. This microfluidic device with hydrogel microfibers is an attractive strategy to fill aneurysms effectively.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2006957, Nomi L. A. N. Sorgenfrei and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that a weak optical excitation creates electrons in the conduction band of p&#8208;doped semiconducting molybdenum disulfide, which travel toward the surface layer. They accumulate in the top layer and concomitantly drive it from the semiconducting toward the metallic phase. The selectivity of synchrotron time&#8208;resolved electron spectroscopy traces this effect. This surface modification influences the properties and functionality of MoS2. Frontispiece Art: Martin K&#252;nsting.

         <title>Solvent Engineering of the Precursor Solution toward Large&#8208;Area Production of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solvent engineering of precursor solutions toward efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is reviewed comprehensively. The key role of solvent engineering for solution&#8208;processed perovskite film is highlighted, especially for the large&#8208;area production of PSCs. Light is shed on the significance of solvent engineering in PSCs, and critical guidance for future commercialization development of highly efficient PSCs is provided.








Abstract
Solar cells based on emerging organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have reached certified power conversion efficiency as high as 25.5%, showing great potential in the next generation of photovoltaics toward large&#8208;scale industrialization. The most competitive feature of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is that the perovskite light absorber can be fabricated by a low&#8208;cost solution method. For the solution method, the characteristics of the solvent play a key role in determining the crystallization kinetics, growth orientation, and optoelectronic properties of the perovskite film. Although significant progress has been made in the field of solvent engineering in PSCs, it is still challenging for the solution method to sustainably produce industrial&#8208;scale PSCs for future commercialization applications. Herein, the advanced progress of solvent engineering of precursor solution in terms of coordination regulation and toxicity reduction is highlighted. The physical and chemical characteristics of different solvents in reducing the toxicity of the solvent system, regulating the coordination property of the precursor solution, controlling the film&#8208;forming process of the perovskite film, and adjusting the photovoltaic performance of the PSC are systematically discussed. Lastly, important perspectives on solvent engineering of the perovskite precursor solution toward future industrial production of high&#8208;performance PSCs are provided.

         <title>Beyond the Visible: Bioinspired Infrared Adaptive Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Infrared adaptation phenomena are ubiquitous in nature and biological systems. A state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art account on emerging bioinspired infrared adaptive materials and their potential applications is provided. Perspectives for future scope, challenges, and opportunities on such a multidisciplinary topic are outlined.








Abstract
Infrared (IR) adaptation phenomena are ubiquitous in nature and biological systems. Taking inspiration from natural creatures, researchers have devoted extensive efforts for developing advanced IR adaptive materials and exploring their applications in areas of smart camouflage, thermal energy management, biomedical science, and many other IR&#8208;related technological fields. Herein, an up&#8208;to&#8208;date review is provided on the recent advancements of bioinspired IR adaptive materials and their promising applications. First an overview of IR adaptation in nature and advanced artificial IR technologies is presented. Recent endeavors are then introduced toward developing bioinspired adaptive materials for IR camouflage and IR radiative cooling. According to the Stefan&#8208;Boltzmann law, IR camouflage can be realized by either emissivity engineering or thermal cloaks. IR radiative cooling can maximize the thermal radiation of an object through an IR atmospheric transparency window, and thus holds great potential for use in energy&#8208;efficient green buildings and smart personal thermal management systems. Recent advances in bioinspired adaptive materials for emerging near&#8208;IR (NIR) applications are also discussed, including NIR&#8208;triggered biological technologies, NIR light&#8208;fueled soft robotics, and NIR light&#8208;driven supramolecular nanosystems. This review concludes with a perspective on the challenges and opportunities for the future development of bioinspired IR adaptive materials.

         <title>Efficient Electron Transport Layer Free Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Solar Cells with Superior Device Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells based on a new electron donor reach power conversion efficiencies exceeding 13% with and without the use of electrode interlayers, but differ strongly in stability. Surprisingly, the surface composition and morphology of the interlayers deteriorate with time even under inert conditions, reducing device performance. Without interlayers, the cells give stable high performance.








Abstract
Electron transport layers (ETLs) placed between the electrodes and a photoactive layer can enhance the performance of organic solar cells but also impose limitations. Most ETLs are ultrathin films, and their deposition can disturb the morphology of the photoactive layers, complicate device fabrication, raise cost, and also affect device stability.

&lt;p&gt;Small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells based on a new electron donor reach power conversion efficiencies exceeding 13% with and without the use of electrode interlayers, but differ strongly in stability. Surprisingly, the surface composition and morphology of the interlayers deteriorate with time even under inert conditions, reducing device performance. Without interlayers, the cells give stable high performance.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electron transport layers (ETLs) placed between the electrodes and a photoactive layer can enhance the performance of organic solar cells but also impose limitations. Most ETLs are ultrathin films, and their deposition can disturb the morphology of the photoactive layers, complicate device fabrication, raise cost, and also affect device stability. To fully overcome such drawbacks, efficient organic solar cells that operate without an ETL are preferred. In this study, a new small&#8208;molecule electron donor (&lt;b&gt;H31&lt;/b&gt;) based on a thiophene&#8208;substituted benzodithiophene core unit with trialkylsilyl side chains is designed and synthesized. Blending &lt;b&gt;H31&lt;/b&gt; with the electron acceptor Y6 gives solar cells with power conversion efficiencies exceeding 13% with and without 2,9&#8208;bis[3&#8208;(dimethyloxidoamino)propyl]anthra[2,1,9&#8208;&lt;i&gt;def&lt;/i&gt;:6,5,10&#8208;&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;&#8242;&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;&#8242;&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;&#8201;&#8242;]diisoquinoline&#8208;1,3,8,10(2H,9H)&#8208;tetrone (PDINO) as the ETL. The ETL&#8208;free cells deliver a superior shelf life compared to devices with an ETL.

         <title>A Polymer Multicellular Nanoengager for Synergistic NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semiconducting polymer nanoengager (SPNE) with both tumor&#8208;associated antigens and T cell stimulating factors is designed to elicit potent multicellular engagement among tumor cells and immunocytes, enabling dual vaccination effects on both dendritic cells and T cells. Thus, the SPNE mediates synergistic second&#8208;near&#8208;infrared&#8208;window (NIR&#8208;II) photothermal immunotherapy that efficiently inhibits tumor growth and metastasis.








Abstract
Cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles (CCNPs) that integrate the biophysiological advantages of cell membranes with the multifunctionalities of synthetic materials hold great promise in cancer immunotherapy. However, strategies have yet to be revealed to further improve their immunotherapeutic efficacy. Herein, a polymer multicellular nanoengager (SPNE) for synergistic second&#8208;near&#8208;infrared&#8208;window (NIR&#8208;II) photothermal immunotherapy is reported. The nanoengager consists of an NIR&#8208;II absorbing polymer as the photothermal core, which is camouflaged with fused membranes derived from immunologically engineered tumor cells and dendritic cells (DCs) as the cancer vaccine shell. In association with the high accumulation in lymph nodes and tumors, the multicellular engagement ability of the SPNE enables effective cross&#8208;interactions among tumor cells, DCs, and T cells, leading to augmented T cell activation relative to bare or tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;coated nanoparticles. Upon deep&#8208;tissue penetrating NIR&#8208;II photoirradiation, SPNE eradicates the tumor and induces immunogenic cell death, further eliciting anti&#8208;tumor T cell immunity. Such a synergistic photothermal immunotherapeutic effect eventually inhibits tumor growth, prevents metastasis and procures immunological memory. Thus, this study presents a general cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coating approach to develop photo&#8208;immunotherapeutic agents for cancer therapy.

         <title>A Morphable Ionic Electrode Based on Thermogel for Non&#8208;Invasive Hairy Plant Electrophysiology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex surface topography on biological tissues presents a major challenge in bio&#8208;electronic interfacing. Taking hairy plants as an example, an ionic electrode based on a thermogel is reported, which adapts and adheres to the abrupt hairy surface asperities, establishing a conformal and adhesive interface. It enables non&#8208;invasive plant electrophysiological measurement with a signal fidelity not achievable by conventional gel electrodes.








Abstract
Plant electrophysiology lays the foundation for smart plant interrogation and intervention. However, plant trichomes with hair&#8208;like morphologies present topographical features that challenge stable and high&#8208;fidelity non&#8208;invasive electrophysiology, due to the inadequate dynamic shape adaptability of conventional electrodes. Here, this issue is overcome using a morphable ionic electrode based on a thermogel, which gradually transforms from a viscous liquid to a viscoelastic gel. This transformation enables the morphable electrode to lock into the abrupt hairy surface irregularities and establish a conformal and adhesive interface. It achieves down to one tenth of the impedance and 4&#8211;5 times the adhesive strengths of conventional hydrogel electrodes on hairy leaves. As a result of the improved electrical and mechanical robustness, the morphable electrode can record more than one order of magnitude higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio on hairy plants and maintains high&#8208;fidelity recording despite plant movements, achieving superior performance to conventional hydrogel electrodes. The reported morphable electrode is a promising tool for hairy plant electrophysiology and may be applied to diversely textured plants for advanced sensing and modulation.

         <title>Functional Skeletal Muscle Regeneration with Thermally Drawn Porous Fibers and Reprogrammed Muscle Progenitors for Volumetric Muscle Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioengineered skeletal muscle construct is generated by culturing induced skeletal myogenic progenitor cells in a thermally drawn polycaprolactone porous fiber scaffold modified with decellularized muscle extracellular matrix. The hybrid composite fiber shows favorable mechanical and biochemical signals for muscle reprogramming and maturation. The bioengineered muscle construct repairs volumetric muscle loss injury via de novo muscle regeneration and functional restoration.








Abstract
Skeletal muscle has an inherent capacity for spontaneous regeneration. However, recovery after severe injuries such as volumetric muscle loss (VML) is limited. There is therefore a need to develop interventions to induce functional skeletal muscle restoration. One suggested approach includes tissue&#8208;engineered muscle constructs. Tissue&#8208;engineering treatments have so far been impeded by the lack of reliable cell sources and the challenges in engineering of suitable tissue scaffolds. To address these challenges, muscle extracellular matrix (MEM) and induced skeletal myogenic progenitor cells (iMPCs) are integrated within thermally drawn fiber based microchannel scaffolds. The microchannel fibers decorated with MEM enhance differentiation and maturation of iMPCs. Furthermore, engraftment of these bioengineered hybrid muscle constructs induce de novo muscle regeneration accompanied with microvessel and neuromuscular junction formation in a VML mouse model, ultimately leading to functional recovery of muscle activity.

         <title>Multiresponsive Nonvolatile Memories Based on Optically Switchable Ferroelectric Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiresponsive organic device based on a photochromic&#8211;ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistor, which is capable of operating as nonvolatile memory with 11 bit memory storage capacity in a single device, is fabricated. The memory elements can be written and erased independently by light or an electric field, with accurate control over the readout signal, excellent repeatability, fast response, and high retention time.








Abstract
Organic transistors are key elements for flexible, wearable, and biocompatible logic applications. Multiresponsivity is highly sought&#8208;after in organic electronics to enable sophisticated operations and functions. Such a challenge can be pursued by integrating more components in a single device, each one responding to a specific external stimulus. Here, the first multiresponsive organic device based on a photochromic&#8211;ferroelectric organic field&#8208;effect transistor, which is capable of operating as nonvolatile memory with 11 bit memory storage capacity in a single device, is reported. The memory elements can be written and erased independently by means of light or an electric field, with accurate control over the readout signal, excellent repeatability, fast response, and high retention time. Such a proof of concept paves the way toward enhanced functional complexity in optoelectronics via the interfacing of multiple components in a single device, in a fully integrated low&#8208;cost technology compatible with flexible substrates.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Sensitive Compression&#8208;Stress Sensor Using Integrated Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Weak compression stresses on the order of 100 to 103 Pa, found in a broad range of physical phenomena from the daily life to the laboratory, are not detected by conventional mechanoresponsive materials. Visualization and colorimetric quantification of weak compression stresses are achieved by integrated stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, namely layered polydiacetylene and dry liquid, through response cascades.








Abstract
Measurement of mechanical stresses, such as compression, shear, and tensile stresses, contributes toward achieving a safer and healthier life. In particular, the detection of weak compression stresses is required for healthcare monitoring and biomedical applications. Compression stresses in the order of 106&#8211;1010&#160;Pa have been visualized and/or quantified using mechano&#8208;responsive materials in previous works. However, in general, it is not easy to detect compression stresses weaker than 103&#160;Pa using conventional mechano&#8208;responsive materials because the dynamic motion of the rigid mechano&#8208;responsive molecules is not induced by such a weak stress. In the present work, weak compression stresses in the order of 100&#8211;103&#160;Pa are visualized and measured via the integration of stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, such as layered polydiacetylene (PDA) and dry liquid (DL), through response cascades. DLs consisting of liquid droplets covered by solid particles release the interior liquid and collapse with application of a weak compression stress. The color of the layered PDA is changed by the spilled liquid as a chemical stress. A variety of weak compression stresses, such as expiratory pressure, are visualized and colorimetrically measured using the paper&#8208;based device of the integrated stimuli&#8208;responsive materials. Diverse mechano&#8208;sensing devices can be designed via the integration of stimuli&#8208;responsive materials.

         <title>Lithium Metal Electrode with Increased Air Stability and Robust Solid Electrolyte Interphase Realized by Silane Coupling Agent Modification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dense modification layer of a silane coupling agent enables Li metal to be stable in air and during cycling. This layer firmly adheres to the Li metal surface by forming Li&#63743;O&#63743;Si bonds, and it connects with the solid electrolyte interphase layer by chemical bonds and physical intertwining effects.








Abstract
The quality of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer is the decisive factor for the electrochemical performance of Li&#8208;metal&#8208;based batteries. Due to the absence of effective bonding, a natural SEI layer may exfoliate from the Li anode during interfacial fluctuations. Here, a silane coupling agent is introduced to serve as an adhesion promoter to bridge these two dissimilar materials via both chemical bonding and physical intertwining effects. Its inorganic reactive groups can combine with the Li substrate by forming Li&#63743;O&#63743;Si bonds, while organic functional groups can take part in the formation of the SEI layer and thereby bond with SEI components. Li metal electrodes with silane coupling agent modification exhibit excellent electrochemical performance, even under extreme testing conditions. This modification layer with dense structure could also protect the Li metal from corrosion by air, evidenced by the comparable electrochemical activity of the modified Li metal electrodes even after being exposed in air for 2 h. This design provides a promising pathway for the development of Li metal electrodes that will be stable both in electrolyte and in air.

         <title>An Electron Acceptor Analogue for Lowering Trap Density in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy of employing an acceptor&#8208;analogue is developed to efficiently reduce trap density to a magnitude of 1015&#160;cm&#8722;3 for organic photovoltaic materials, which is comparable to and even lower than those of some inorganic counterparts, and boosts the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells up to 17.8%.








Abstract
Typical organic semiconductor materials exhibit a high trap density of states, ranging from 1016 to 1018&#160;cm&#8722;3, which is one of the important factors in limiting the improvement of power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs). In order to reduce the trap density within OSCs, a new strategy to design and synthesize an electron acceptor analogue, BTPR, is developed, which is introduced into OSCs as a third component to enhance the molecular packing order of electron acceptor with and without blending a polymer donor. Finally, the as&#8208;cast ternary OSC devices employing BTPR show a notable PCE of 17.8%, with a low trap density (1015&#160;cm&#8722;3) and a low energy loss (0.217&#160;eV) caused by non&#8208;radiative recombination. This PCE is among the highest values for single&#8208;junction OSCs. The trap density of OSCs with the BTPR additives, as low as 1015&#160;cm&#8722;3, is comparable to and even lower than those of several typical high&#8208;performance inorganic/hybrid counterparts, like 1016&#160;cm&#8722;3 for amorphous silicon, 1016&#160;cm&#8722;3 for metal oxides, and 1014 to 1015&#160;cm&#8722;3 for halide perovskite thin film, and makes it promising for OSCs to obtain a PCE of up to 20%.

         <title>3D Artificial Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase for Lithium Metal Anodes Enabled by Insulator&#8211;Metal&#8211;Insulator Layered Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) based on a g&#8208;C3N4 layer, which possesses high structural and compositional homogeneity, is proposed to guide conformal Li deposition in the van der Waals gap between graphene and the g&#8208;C3N4. The design of a 3D artificial SEI enables stable cycling of Li metal anodes and provides potential for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries.








Abstract
Despite considerable efforts to prevent lithium (Li) dendrite growth, stable cycling of Li metal anodes with various structures remains extremely difficult due to the direct contact of the liquid electrolyte with Li. Rational design of solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) for 3D electrodes is a promising but still challenging strategy for preventing Li dendrite growth and avoiding lithium&#8211;electrolyte side reactions in Li&#8208;metal batteries. Here, a 3D architecture is constructed with g&#8208;C3N4/graphene/g&#8208;C3N4 insulator&#8211;metal&#8211;insulator sandwiched nanosheets to guide uniform Li plating/stripping in the van der Waals gap between the graphene and the g&#8208;C3N4, and the function of which can be regarded as a 3D artificial SEI. Li deposition on the surface of g&#8208;C3N4 is suppressed due to its insulating nature. However, its uniform lithiophilic sites and nanopore channels enable homogeneous lithium plating between the graphene and the g&#8208;C3N4, prohibiting the direct contact of the electrolyte with the Li metal. The use of the g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;layer&#8208;modified 3D anode enables long&#8208;term Li deposition with a high Coulombic efficiency and stable cycling of full cells under high cathode loading, limited Li excess, and lean electrolyte conditions. The concept of a 3D artificial SEI will shed light on developing safe and stable Li&#8208;metal anodes.

Surface decoration of living cells by exogenous substances offers a unique tool for tuning cell behaviors, which plays critical roles in cell&#8208;based therapy. A facile, yet versatile approach for decorating individual living cells with multimodal coatings by simply co&#8208;depositing dopamine with functional small molecules or polymers is reported. Decorated cells show strikingly enhanced treatment efficacy in colitis mice.








Abstract
Surface decoration of living cells by exogenous substances offers a unique tool for understanding and tuning cell behaviors, which plays a critical role in cell&#8208;based therapy. Here, a facile yet versatile approach for decorating individual living cells with multimodal coatings is reported. By simply co&#8208;depositing with dopamine under a cytocompatible condition, various functional small molecules and polymers can be encoded to form a multifunctional coating on a cell's surface. The accessibility and versatility of this method to decorate diverse cells, including bacteria, fungi, and mammalian cells is demonstrated. With the ability to tune surface functions, ligand co&#8208;deposited gut microbiota is prepared as oral therapeutics for targeted treatment of colitis. Given the dual cytoprotective and targeting effects of the coating, decorated cells show more than 30&#8208;times higher bioavailability in the gut and fourfold higher accumulation in the inflamed tissue in comparison with those of uncoated bacteria. Multimodal therapeutic cells further validate strikingly increased treatment efficacy over clinical aminosalicylic acid in colitis mice. Decorating with multifunctional coatings proposes a robust platform for developing multimodal cells for enhanced cell&#8208;based therapy.

         <title>Engineering the Optical Emission and Robustness of Metal&#8208;Halide Layered Perovskites through Ligand Accommodation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The organic component in 2D layered perovskites can grant access to many possibilities for material design, in view of the rich variety. This work shows how the choice of the structure and chain length of organic cations can effectively guide the precise design of the emission color and efficiency of such versatile nanomaterials.








Abstract
The unique combination of organic and inorganic layers in 2D layered perovskites offers promise for the design of a variety of materials for mechatronics, flexoelectrics, energy conversion, and lighting. However, the potential tailoring of their properties through the organic building blocks is not yet well understood. Here, different classes of organoammonium molecules are exploited to engineer the optical emission and robustness of a new set of Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper metal&#8208;halide layered perovskites. It is shown that the type of molecule regulates the number of hydrogen bonds that it forms with the edge&#8208;sharing [PbBr6]4&#8208; octahedra layers, leading to strong differences in the material emission and tunability of the color coordinates, from deep&#8208;blue to pure&#8208;white. Also, the emission intensity strongly depends on the length of the molecules, thereby providing an additional parameter to optimize their emission efficiency. The combined experimental and computational study provides a detailed understanding of the impact of lattice distortions, compositional defects, and the anisotropic crystal structure on the emission of such layered materials. It is foreseen that this rational design can be extended to other types of organic linkers, providing a yet unexplored path to tailor the optical and mechanical properties of these materials and to unlock new functionalities.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Dioxide&#8208;Coating&#8208;Instructed Plasmonic Modulation of Gold Nanorods for Activatable Duplex&#8208;Imaging&#8208;Guided NIR&#8208;II Photothermal&#8208;Chemodynamic Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
A plasmonic modulation strategy of gold nanorods through manganese dioxide coating is explored for activatable photoacoustic/magnetic resonance duplex&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided photothermal&#8208;chemodynamic therapy in the second near&#8208;infrared window.








Abstract
Nanotheranostic agents of gold nanomaterials in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window have attracted significant attention in cancer management, owing to the reduced background signal and deeper penetration depth in tissues. However, it is still challenging to modulate the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of gold nanomaterials from the first near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;I) to NIR&#8208;II region. Herein, a plasmonic modulation strategy of gold nanorods (GNRs) through manganese dioxide coating is developed for NIR&#8208;II photoacoustic/magnetic resonance (MR) duplex&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided NIR&#8208;II photothermal chemodynamic therapy. GNRs are coated with silica dioxide (SiO2) and then covered with magnesium dioxide (MnO2) to obtain the final product of GNR@SiO2@MnO2 (denoted as GSM). The LSPR peak of GNRs could be tuned by adjusting the thickness of the MnO2 layer. Theoretical simulations reveal that this plasmonic modulation is mainly due to the change of refraction index around the GNRs after coating with the MnO2 layer. Additionally, the MnO2 layer is demonstrated to degrade into Mn2+ ions in response to peroxide and acidic protons in the tumor microenvironment, which allows for MR imaging and chemodynamic therapy. This plasmonic modulation strategy can be adapted to other metal nanomaterials and the construction of a new class of NIR&#8208;II nanotheranostics.

         <title>Degradable Poly(vinyl alcohol)&#8208;Based Supramolecular Plastics with High Mechanical Strength in a Watery Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Completely degradable and easily processable poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)&#8208;based supramolecular plastics are fabricated by complexation of vanillin&#8208;grafted PVA, hydrophobic humic acid, and Fe3+ ions. In watery environments, the plastics have a mechanical strength similar to that of polyethylene in its dry state. The PVA&#8208;based plastics can completely degrade into nontoxic species after being placed under soil for approximately 108 d.








Abstract
It is challenging to fabricate degradable poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)&#8208;based plastics that can be used in watery environments because PVA is soluble in water. In this study, PVA&#8208;based supramolecular plastics with excellent degradability in soil and high mechanical strength in watery environments are fabricated by the complexation of vanillin&#8208;grafted PVA (VPVA), hydrophobic humic acid (HA), and Fe3+ ions (hereafter denoted as VPVA&#8211;HA&#8211;Fe complexes). Large&#8208;area PVA&#8208;based plastics can be easily prepared from a solution of VPVA&#8211;HA&#8211;Fe complexes using a blade&#8208;coating method. The high&#8208;density of hydrogen bonds and coordination interactions, as well as the reinforcement of self&#8208;assembled Fe3+&#8208;chelated HA nanoparticles, facilitate the fabrication of PVA&#8208;based plastics with a breaking strength of &#8776;85.0&#160;MPa. After immersion in water at room temperature for 7 d, the PVA&#8208;based plastics exhibit a breaking strength of &#8776;26.2&#160;MPa, which is similar to that of polyethylene in its dry state. Furthermore, owing to the reversibility of the hydrogen bonds and coordination interactions, the VPVA&#8211;HA&#8211;Fe plastics are recyclable and can be conveniently processed into plastic products with desired shapes. After being placed under soil for &#8776;108 d, the PVA&#8208;based plastics are completely degraded into nontoxic species without requiring manual interference.

         <title>Water&#8211;Salt Oligomers Enable Supersoluble Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8211;salt oligomers break through the physical solubility limits of aqueous electrolytes, enabling high&#8208;capacity rechargeable batteries based on zinc&#8211;halogen chemistry.

Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable batteries are highly safe, low&#8208;cost, and environmentally friendly, but restricted by low energy density. One of the most efficient solutions is to improve the concentration of the aqueous electrolytes. However, each salt is limited by its physical solubility, generally below 21&#8211;32&#160;mol&#160;kg&#8722;1 (m). Here, a ZnCl2/ZnBr2/Zn(OAc)2 aqueous electrolyte with a record super&#8208;solubility up to 75 m is reported, which breaks through the physical solubility limit. This is attributed to the formation of acetate&#8208;capped water&#8211;salt oligomers bridged by Br&#8722;/Cl&#8722;&#8208;H and Br&#8722;/Cl&#8722;/O&#8208;Zn2+ interactions. Mass spectrometry indicates that acetate anions containing nonpolarized protons prohibit the overgrowth and precipitation of ionic oligomers. The polymer&#8208;like glass transition temperature of such inorganic electrolytes is found at &#8776;&#8722;70 to &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C, without the observation of peaks for salt&#8208;crystallization and water&#8208;freezing from 40 to &#8722;80&#160;&#176;C. This supersoluble electrolyte enables high&#8208;performance aqueous dual&#8208;ion batteries that exhibit a reversible capacity of 605.7&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, corresponding to an energy density of 908.5&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1, with a coulombic efficiency of 98.07%. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and Raman technologies reveal that such high ionic concentrations of the supersoluble electrolyte enable a stage&#8208;1 intercalation of bromine into macroscopically assembled graphene cathode.

         <title>Analysis of External and Internal Disorder to Understand Band&#8208;Like Transport in n&#8208;Type Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular vibrations govern the charge transport in organic semiconductors, which is limited by different sources of disorder. Understanding and mastering the disorder in these materials can drive the design of better semiconductors featuring band&#8208;like transport.








Abstract
Charge transport in organic semiconductors is notoriously extremely sensitive to the presence of disorder, both internal and external (i.e., related to interactions with the dielectric layer), especially for n&#8208;type materials. Internal dynamic disorder stems from large thermal fluctuations both in intermolecular transfer integrals and (molecular) site energies in weakly interacting van der Waals solids and sources transient localization of the charge carriers. The molecular vibrations that drive transient localization typically operate at low&#8208;frequency (&lt;a&#8208;few&#8208;hundred cm&#8722;1), which makes it difficult to assess them experimentally. Hitherto, this has prevented the identification of clear molecular design rules to control and reduce dynamic disorder. In addition, the disorder can also be external, being controlled by the gate insulator dielectric properties. Here a comprehensive study of charge transport in two closely related n&#8208;type molecular organic semiconductors using a combination of temperature&#8208;dependent inelastic neutron scattering and photoelectron spectroscopy corroborated by electrical measurements, theory, and simulations is reported. Unambiguous evidence that ad hoc molecular design enables the electron charge carriers to be freed from both internal and external disorder to ultimately reach band&#8208;like electron transport is provided.

         <title>An Organodiselenide Comediator to Facilitate Sulfur Redox Kinetics in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organodiselenide, diphenyl diselenide (DPDSe), is proposed to accelerate the sulfur redox kinetics as a redox comediator, which endows Li&#8211;S batteries with superb rate performance, remarkable cycling stability, and high actual energy density of 301&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1. This work demonstrates a novel redox comediation strategy to facilitate the sulfur redox kinetics under practical pouch cell conditions.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are considered as promising next&#8208;generation energy storage devices due to their ultrahigh theoretical energy density, where soluble lithium polysulfides are crucial in the Li&#8211;S electrochemistry as intrinsic redox mediators. However, the poor mediation capability of the intrinsic polysulfide mediators leads to sluggish redox kinetics, further rendering limited rate performances, low discharge capacity, and rapid capacity decay. Here, an organodiselenide, diphenyl diselenide (DPDSe), is proposed to accelerate the sulfur redox kinetics as a redox comediator. DPDSe spontaneously reacts with lithium polysulfides to generate lithium phenylseleno polysulfides (LiPhSePSs) with improved redox mediation capability. The as&#8208;generated LiPhSePSs afford faster sulfur redox kinetics and increase the deposition dimension of lithium sulfide. Consequently, the DPDSe comediator endows Li&#8211;S batteries with superb rate performance of 817&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 2 C and remarkable cycling stability with limited anode excess. Moreover, Li&#8211;S pouch cells with the DPDSe comediator achieve an actual initial energy density of 301&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 and 30 stable cycles. This work demonstrates a novel redox comediation strategy with an effective organodiselenide comediator to facilitate the sulfur redox kinetics under pouch cell conditions and inspires further exploration in mediating Li&#8211;S kinetics for practical high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.

Platinum (Pt) single&#8208;atom&#8208;catalyst is verified as a very successful route to approach the size limit of Pt catalysts, while how to further improve the catalytic efficiency of Pt is a fundamental scientific question and is challenging.

Abstract
The platinum single&#8208;atom&#8208;catalyst is verified as a very successful route to approach the size limit of Pt catalysts, while how to further improve the catalytic efficiency of Pt is a fundamental scientific question and is challenging because the size issue of Pt is approached at the ultimate ceiling as single atoms. Here, a new route for further improving Pt catalytic efficiency by cobalt (Co) and Pt dual&#8208;single&#8208;atoms on titanium dioxide (TiO2) surfaces, which contains a fraction of nonbonding oxygen&#8208;coordinated Co&#8211;O&#8211;Pt dimers, is reported. These Co&#8211;Pt dimer sites originate from loading high&#8208;density Pt single&#8208;atoms and Co single&#8208;atoms, with them anchoring randomly on the TiO2 substrate. This dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalyst yields 13.4% dimer sites and exhibits an ultrahigh and stable photocatalytic activity with a rate of 43.467&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and external quantum efficiency of &#8776;83.4% at 365&#160;nm. This activity far exceeds those of equal amounts of Pt single&#8208;atom and typical Pt clustered catalysts by 1.92 and 1.64 times, respectively. The enhancement mechanism relies on the oxygen&#8208;coordinated Co&#8211;O&#8211;Pt dimer coupling, which can mutually optimize the electronic states of both Pt and Co sites to weaken H* binding. Namely, the &#8220;mute&#8221; Co single&#8208;atom is activated by Pt single&#8208;atom and the activity of the Pt atom is further enhanced through the dimer interaction. This strategy of nonbonding interactive dimer sites and the oxygen&#8208;mediated catalytic mechanisms provide emerging rich opportunities for greatly improving the catalytic efficiency and developing novel catalysts with creating new electronic states.

         <title>Stable and Highly Efficient Hydrogen Evolution from Seawater Enabled by an Unsaturated Nickel Surface Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unsaturated nickel surface nitride exhibits efficient and stable performance for hydrogen evolution from seawater. The origin of the activity and stability of the unique surface nitride is investigated using in situ Raman spectroscopy. By coupling with hydrazine oxidation at the anode, a flow&#8208;electrolyzer is assembled that can deliver a current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2 with a small cell voltage of 0.7&#160;V.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic production of hydrogen from seawater provides a route to low&#8208;cost and clean energy conversion. However, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) using seawater is greatly hindered by the lack of active and stable catalysts. Herein, an unsaturated nickel surface nitride (Ni&#8208;SN@C) catalyst that is active and stable for the HER in alkaline seawater is prepared. It achieves a low overpotential of 23&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline seawater electrolyte, which is superior to Pt/C. Compared to conventional transition metal nitrides or metal/metal nitride heterostructures, the Ni&#8208;SN@C has no detectable bulk nickel nitride phase. Instead, unsaturated Ni&#63743;N bonding on the surface is present. In situ Raman measurements show that the Ni&#8208;SN@C performs like Pt with the ability to generate hydronium ions in a high&#8208;pH electrolyte. The catalyst operation is then demonstrated in a two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer system, coupling with hydrazine oxidation at the anode. Using this system, a cell voltage of only 0.7&#160;V is required to achieve a current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Scalable Superior Chemical Sensing Performance of Stretchable Ionotronic Skin via a &#960;&#8208;Hole Receptor Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A skin&#8208;attachable chemical sensor showing high sensitivity, selectivity, stability, and even scalability is demonstrated, which is termed an ionotronic gas&#8208;sensing sticker. Ultimately, the proposed strategy is expected to provide new guidelines for sensing channels for next&#8208;generation wearable gas&#8208;sensor platforms.








Abstract
Skin&#8208;attachable gas sensors provide a next&#8208;generation wearable platform for real&#8208;time protection of human health by monitoring environmental and physiological chemicals. However, the creation of skin&#8208;like wearable gas sensors, possessing high sensitivity, selectivity, stability, and scalability (4S) simultaneously, has been a big challenge. Here, an ionotronic gas&#8208;sensing sticker (IGS) is demonstrated, implemented with free&#8208;standing polymer electrolyte (ionic thermoplastic polyurethane, i&#8208;TPU) as a sensing channel and inkjet&#8208;printed stretchable carbon nanotube electrodes, which enables the IGS to exhibit high sensitivity, selectivity, stability (against mechanical stress, humidity, and temperature), and scalable fabrication, simultaneously. The IGS demonstrates reliable sensing capability against nitrogen dioxide molecules under not only harsh mechanical stress (cyclic bending with the radius of curvature of 1 mm and cyclic straining at 50%), but also environmental conditions (thermal aging from &#8722;45 to 125 &#176;C for 1000 cycles and humidity aging for 24 h at 85% relative humidity). Further, through systematic experiments and theoretical calculations, a &#960;&#8208;hole receptor mechanism is proposed, which can effectively elucidate the origin of the high sensitivity (up to parts per billion level) and selectivity of the ionotronic sensing system. Consequently, this work provides a guideline for the design of ionotronic materials for the achievement of high&#8208;performance and skin&#8208;attachable gas&#8208;sensor platforms.

         <title>Efficient Low&#8208;Grade Heat Harvesting Enabled by Tuning the Hydration Entropy in an Electrochemical System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The temperature coefficient is optimized by tuning the hydration entropy during cation intercalation with Prussian blue analogues. A high thermal energy conversion efficiency of 50% Carnot efficiency is obtained in the thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle in the very low temperature range of 10&#8211;50&#160;&#176;C. This demonstrated efficient system paves the way for low&#8208;grade heat harvesting.








Abstract
Harvesting of low&#8208;grade heat (&lt;100&#160;&#176;C) is promising, but its application is hampered by a lack of efficient and low&#8208;cost systems. The thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle (TREC) is a potential alternative system with high energy&#8208;conversion efficiency. Here, the temperature coefficient (&#945;), which is a key factor in a TREC, is studied by tuning the hydration entropy of the electrochemical reaction. The change of &#945; in copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCFe) with intercalation of different monovalent cations (Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+) and a larger &#945; value of &#8722;1.004&#160;mV K&#8722;1 being found in the Rb+ system are observed. With a view to practical application, a full cell is constructed for low&#8208;grade heat harvesting. The resultant &#951;e is 4.34% when TREC operates between 10 and 50&#160;&#176;C, which further reaches 6.21% when 50% heat recuperation is considered. This efficiency equals to 50% of the Carnot efficiency, which is thought to be the highest &#951;e reported for low&#8208;grade heat harvesting systems. This study provides a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms governing the TREC, and the demonstrated efficient system paves the way for low&#8208;grade heat harvesting.

         <title>Layered Heterostructure Ionogel Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionogel electrolytes with a layered heterostructure are developed using hexagonal boron nitride nanoplatelets and two imidazolium ionic liquids with different electrochemical stability windows. Compared to ionogels using the individual ionic liquids, the layered heterostructure ionogels provide broadened electrochemical stability windows while maintaining desirable ionic conductivity, suggesting a promising electrolyte strategy for high operating voltages and rate performance in solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Ionogel electrolytes based on ionic liquids and gelling matrices offer several advantages for solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries, including nonflammability, wide processing compatibility, and favorable electrochemical and thermal properties. However, the absence of ionic liquids that are concurrently stable at low and high potentials constrains the electrochemical windows of ionogel electrolytes and thus their high&#8208;energy&#8208;density applications. Here, ionogel electrolytes with a layered heterostructure are introduced, combining high&#8208;potential (anodic stability: &gt;5&#160;V vs Li/Li+) and low&#8208;potential (cathodic stability: &lt;0&#160;V vs Li/Li+) imidazolium ionic liquids in a hexagonal boron nitride nanoplatelet matrix. These layered heterostructure ionogel electrolytes lead to extended electrochemical windows, while preserving high ionic conductivity (&gt;1&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature). Using the layered heterostructure ionogel electrolytes, full&#8208;cell solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries with a nickel manganese cobalt oxide cathode and a graphite anode are demonstrated, exhibiting voltages that are unachievable with either the high&#8208;potential or low&#8208;potential ionic liquid alone. Compared to ionogel electrolytes based on mixed ionic liquids, the layered heterostructure ionogel electrolytes enable higher stability operation of full&#8208;cell lithium&#8208;ion batteries, resulting in significantly enhanced cycling performance.

         <title>A Nanoformulation&#8208;Mediated Multifunctional Stem Cell Therapy with Improved Beta&#8208;Amyloid Clearance and Neural Regeneration for Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoformulation&#8208;mediated multifunctional stem cell therapy is developed for Alzheimer's disease treatment with improved beta&#8208;amyloid clearance and neural regeneration. With the synergy of neprilysin (NEP) gene&#8208;based beta&#8208;amyloid degradation, nanoformulation&#8208;based neuronal differentiation promotion, and neural stem cells, a single administration of this therapy achieves long&#8208;term efficacy (6&#160;months) with respect to memory reversal and improvement of learning deficits.








Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common dementia that is currently incurable. The existing treatments can only moderately relieve the symptoms of AD&#160;to slow down its progress. How to achieve effective neural regeneration to ameliorate cognitive impairments is a major challenge for current AD&#160;treatment. Here, the therapeutic potential of a nanoformulation&#8208;mediated neural stem cell (NSC) therapy capable of simultaneous A&#946; clearance and neural regeneration is investigated in a murine model. Genetically engineered NSCs capable of stably and continuously expressing neprilysin (NEP) are developed to enhance A&#946;&#160;degradation and NSC survival in the brain. A PBAE&#8208;PLGA&#8208;Ag2S&#8208;RA&#8208;siSOX9 (PPAR&#8208;siSOX9) nanoformulation with high gene/drug deliverability is synthesized to overcome AD microenvironment&#8208;associated adverse effects and to promote neuronal differentiation of the NEP&#8208;expressing NSCs. For achieving accurate stereotactic transplantation, Ag2S quantum&#8208;dot&#8208;based fluorescence imaging is used to guide NSC transplantation in real time. This strategy shows numerous benefits, including efficient and long&#8208;lasting A&#946; degradation, improved neural regeneration, and accurate cell transplantation. It is shown that a single administration of this therapy achieves long&#8208;term efficacy (6&#160;months) with respect to memory reversal and improvement of learning deficits.

         <title>Reducing Energy Disorder of Hole Transport Layer by Charge Transfer Complex for High Performance p&#8211;i&#8211;n Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charge&#8208;transfer complex strategy to reduce the energy disorder of organic semiconductor (OS) charge transport layers (CTLs) by doping a well&#8208;designed OS (BDT&#8208;Si) with electron&#8208;acceptor features in a commercial hole&#8208;transport material (PTAA) is proposed. As a result, the p&#8211;i&#8211;n planar perovskite solar cells with the optimized hole&#8208;transport layer exhibit the best power conversion efficiency of 21.87%, and good operating stability at maximum power point under continuous illumination.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed organic semiconductor charge&#8208;transport layers (OS&#8208;CTLs) with high mobility, low trap density, and energy level alignment have dominated the important progress in p&#8211;i&#8211;n planar perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs). Unfortunately, their inevitable long chains result in weak molecular stacking, which is likely to generate high energy disorder and deteriorate the charge&#8208;transport ability of OS&#8208;CTLs. Here, a charge&#8208;transfer complex (CTC) strategy to reduce the energy disorder in the OS&#8208;CTLs by doping an organic semiconductor, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(4,8&#8208;bis(5&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene&#8208;2,6&#8208;diyl)bis(N,N&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)aniline) (BDT&#8208;Si), in a commercial hole&#8208;transport layer (HTL), poly[bis(4&#8208;phenyl) (2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)amine (PTAA), is proposed. The formation of the CTC makes the PTAA conjugated backbone electron&#8208;deficient, resulting in a quinoidal and stiffer character, which is likely to planarize the PTAA backbone and enhance the ordering of the film in nanoscale. The resultant HTL exhibits a reduced energy disorder, which simultaneously promotes hole transport in the HTL, hole extraction at the interface, energy level alignment, and quasi&#8208;Fermi level splitting in the device. As a result, the p&#8211;i&#8211;n planar pero&#8208;SCs with optimized HTL exhibit the best power conversion efficiency of 21.87% with good operating stability. This finding demonstrates that the CTC strategy is an effective way to reduce the energy disorder in HTLs and to improve the performance of planar pero&#8208;SCs.

         <title>Face&#8208;to&#8208;Face Growth of Wafer&#8208;Scale 2D Semiconducting MOF Films on Dielectric Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the capillary phenomenon, a face&#8208;to&#8208;face confinement growth method is developed to grow high&#8208;quality wafer&#8208;sacle Cu2(TCPP) (TCPP = meso&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphine) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) film on dielectric substrates. The film exhibits p&#8208;type semiconducting property and excellent photoelectric response. Meanwhile, this growth strategy can also be used to prepare other wafer&#8208;sacle conductive MOF films.








Abstract
The preparation of large&#8208;area 2D conductive metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films remains highly desirable but challenging. Here, inspired by the capillary phenomenon, a face&#8208;to&#8208;face confinement growth method to grow conductive 2D Cu2(TCPP) (TCPP = meso&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphine) MOF films on dielectric substrates is developed. Trace amounts of solutions containing low&#8208;concentration Cu2+ and TCPP are pumped cyclically into a micropore interface to produce this growth. The crystal structures are confirmed with various characterization techniques, which include high&#8208;resolution atomic force microscopy and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (Cryo&#8208;TEM). The Cu2(TCPP) MOF film exhibit an electrical conductivity of &#8776;0.007 S cm&#8722;1, which is approximately four orders of magnitude higher than other carboxylic&#8208;acid&#8208;based MOF materials (10&#8722;6 S cm&#8722;1). Other wafer&#8208;scale conductive MOF films such as M3(HHTP)2 (M = Cu, Co, and Ni; HHTP = 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;triphenylenehexol) can be produced utilizing this strategy and suggests this method has widescale applicability potential.

         <title>Texture Formation in Polycrystalline Thin Films of All&#8208;Inorganic Lead Halide Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polycrystalline all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx perovskite exhibits pervasive texture expressions when solution processed into thin&#8208;film optical devices. Synchrotron&#8208;based large&#8208;area X&#8208;ray scattering techniques provide insights, which connect the final texture formation to the crystal symmetry of the halide perovskite, which can be tuned via halide mixing. Both I&#8208;rich and Br&#8208;rich materials each exhibit two different, energetically favored texture directions.








Abstract
Controlling grain orientations within polycrystalline all&#8208;inorganic halide perovskite solar cells can help increase conversion efficiencies toward their thermodynamic limits; however, the forces governing texture formation are ambiguous. Using synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, mesostructure formation within polycrystalline CsPbI2.85Br0.15 powders as they cool from a high&#8208;temperature cubic perovskite (&#945;&#8208;phase) is reported. Tetragonal distortions (&#946;&#8208;phase) trigger preferential crystallographic alignment within polycrystalline ensembles, a feature that is suggested here to be coordinated across multiple neighboring grains via interfacial forces that select for certain lattice distortions over others. External anisotropy is then imposed on polycrystalline thin films of orthorhombic (&#947;&#8208;phase) CsPbI3&#8208;xBrx perovskite via substrate clamping, revealing two fundamental uniaxial texture formations; i)&#160;I&#8208;rich films possess orthorhombic&#8208;like texture (&lt;100&gt; out&#8208;of&#8208;plane; &lt;010&gt; and &lt;001&gt; in&#8208;plane), while ii) Br&#8208;rich films form tetragonal&#8208;like texture (&lt;110&gt; out&#8208;of&#8208;plane; &lt;110&gt; and &lt;001&gt; in&#8208;plane). In contrast to relatively uninfluential factors like the choice of substrate, film thickness, and annealing temperature, Br incorporation modifies the &#947;&#8208;CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx crystal structure by reducing the orthorhombic lattice distortion (making it more tetragonal&#8208;like) and governs the formation of the different, energetically favored textures within polycrystalline thin films.

Using synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, mesostructure formation within polycrystalline CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;2.85&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;0.15&lt;/sub&gt; powders as they cool from a high&#8208;temperature cubic perovskite (&#945;&#8208;phase) is reported. Tetragonal distortions (&#946;&#8208;phase) trigger preferential crystallographic alignment within polycrystalline ensembles, a feature that is suggested here to be coordinated across multiple neighboring grains via interfacial forces that select for certain lattice distortions over others. External anisotropy is then imposed on polycrystalline thin films of orthorhombic (&#947;&#8208;phase) CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&#8208;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Br&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; perovskite via substrate clamping, revealing two fundamental uniaxial texture formations; i)&#160;I&#8208;rich films possess orthorhombic&#8208;like texture (&amp;lt;100&amp;gt; out&#8208;of&#8208;plane; &amp;lt;010&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;001&amp;gt; in&#8208;plane), while ii) Br&#8208;rich films form tetragonal&#8208;like texture (&amp;lt;110&amp;gt; out&#8208;of&#8208;plane; &amp;lt;110&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;001&amp;gt; in&#8208;plane). In contrast to relatively uninfluential factors like the choice of substrate, film thickness, and annealing temperature, Br incorporation modifies the &#947;&#8208;CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Br&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; crystal structure by reducing the orthorhombic lattice distortion (making it more tetragonal&#8208;like) and governs the formation of the different, energetically favored textures within polycrystalline thin films.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Designing Adaptive Binders for Microenvironment Settings of Silicon Anode Particles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
For achieving high capacity in the silicon anode of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, an &#8220;adaptive binder&#8221; is reported. The polymeric binder containing plant&#8208;inspired adhesive phenolic moieties&#8212;gallols&#8212;shows initial adaptive properties via reversible hydrogen bonds for setting of silicon microenvironments and further stabilization of SEI layers through irreversible covalent crosslinking of gallols, implementing great electrochemical performance at a rapid charge/discharge rate.








Abstract
This study reports the concept of an &#8220;adaptive binder&#8221; to address the silicon anode challenge in Li&#8208;ion batteries. Binders exhibit adaptable capabilities upon gradual changes in the microenvironments surrounding silicon particles during anodic expansion&#8211;shrinkage cycles. Long, flexible binder chains are repositioned and reoriented upon the gradual formation of Si&#8208;micro&#8208;environments (Si&#8208;&#956;&#8208;env) during the early battery cycles. At this stage, the chemical interactions between the polymeric binders are reversible hydrogen bonds. As the Si&#8208;&#956;&#8208;env become stably set by repeated battery cycles, the chemical interactions exhibit reversible&#8208;to&#8208;irreversible transitions by the formation of covalent linkages between the binder polymers at the later stage of cycles. The binder polymer showing the aforementioned adaptive properties is hyaluronic acid, which has never been explored as a silicon&#8208;anode binder material, onto which the plant&#8208;inspired adhesive phenolic moiety, gallol (1,2,3&#8208;trihydroxybenzene), is conjugated (HA&#8211;GA) for stable adhesion to the surfaces of silicon particles. It is confirmed that the HA&#8211;GA binder can maintain a charge capacity that is approximately 3.3 times higher (1153 mAh g&#8722;1) than that of the nonconjugated HA binder (347 mAh g&#8722;1) after 600 cycles even at a rapid charge/discharge rate of 1 C (3500&#160;mA g&#8722;1), indicating that adaptive properties are an important factor to consider in designing silicon&#8208;anode binders.

         <title>Whole&#8208;Voltage&#8208;Range Oxygen Redox in P2&#8208;Layered Cathode Materials for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na0.7Mg0.2[Fe0.2Mn0.6&#9633;0.2]O2 with native transitional metal (TM) vacancies is designed as a novel cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The TM vacancies lead to nonbonding O 2p orbitals in this material, pointing toward these vacancies triggering reversible whole&#8208;voltage&#8208;range oxygen redox during charge and discharge processes. This work provides new ideals for design of cathode materials in anionic redox chemistry.








Abstract
Oxygen&#8208;redox of layer&#8208;structured metal&#8208;oxide cathodes has drawn great attention as an effective approach to break through the bottleneck of their capacity limit. However, reversible oxygen&#8208;redox can only be obtained in the high&#8208;voltage region (usually over 3.5 V) in current metal&#8208;oxide cathodes. Here, we realize reversible oxygen&#8208;redox in a wide voltage range of 1.5&#8211;4.5 V in a P2&#8208;layered Na0.7Mg0.2[Fe0.2Mn0.6&#9633;0.2]O2 cathode material, where intrinsic vacancies are located in transition&#8208;metal (TM) sites and Mg&#8208;ions are located in Na sites. Mg&#8208;ions in the Na layer serve as &#8220;pillars&#8221; to stabilize the layered structure during electrochemical cycling, especially in the high&#8208;voltage region. Intrinsic vacancies in the TM layer create the local configurations of &#8220;&#9633;&#8211;O&#8211;&#9633;&#8221;, &#8220;Na&#8211;O&#8211;&#9633;&#8221; and &#8220;Mg&#8211;O&#8211;&#9633;&#8221; to trigger oxygen&#8208;redox in the whole voltage range of charge&#8211;discharge. Time&#8208;resolved techniques demonstrate that the P2 phase is well maintained in a wide potential window range of 1.5&#8211;4.5 V even at 10 C. It is revealed that charge compensation from Mn&#8208; and O&#8208;ions contributes to the whole voltage range of 1.5&#8211;4.5 V, while the redox of Fe&#8208;ions only contributes to the high&#8208;voltage region of 3.0&#8211;4.5 V. The orphaned electrons in the nonbonding 2p orbitals of O that point toward TM&#8208;vacancy sites are responsible for reversible oxygen&#8208;redox, and Mg&#8208;ions in Na sites suppress oxygen release effectively.

         <title>Programmable Phototaxis of Metal&#8211;Phenolic Particle Microswimmers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic microswimmers with precise light&#8208;driven velocities are engineered with promise for robotics, drug delivery, and environmental applications. Various cargos with distinct spectral absorption profiles can be loaded into the microswimmers to tune the specific wavelengths of light that lead to motion under ultraviolet, blue, green, and orange light.








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven directional motion is common in nature but remains a challenge for synthetic microparticles, particularly regarding collective motion on a macroscopic scale. Successfully engineering microparticles with light&#8208;driven collective motion could lead to breakthroughs in drug delivery, contaminant sensing, environmental remediation, and artificial life. Herein, metal&#8211;phenolic particle microswimmers capable of autonomously sensing and swimming toward an external light source are reported, with the speed regulated by the wavelength and intensity of illumination. These microswimmers can travel macroscopic distances (centimeters) and can remain illuminated for hours without degradation of motility. Experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrate that motion is generated through chemical transformations of the organic component of the metal&#8211;phenolic complex. Furthermore, cargos with specific spectral absorption profiles can be loaded into the particles and endow the particle microswimmers with activated motion corresponding to these spectral characteristics. The programmable nature of the light navigation, tunable size of the particles, and versatility of cargo loading demonstrate the versatility of these metal&#8211;phenolic particle microswimmers.

Flash&#8208;induced robust Cu on a glass substrate for inorganic&#8208;based micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diodes (&#956;LEDs) is developed by chemical/physical interlocking. The Cu2O layer at Cu/glass interface and Cu nano&#8208;interlocking resolve the inherent lattice mismatch for strong electrode adhesion, resulting in high optical power (41&#160;mW mm&#8211;2) of an AlGaInP vertical thin&#8208;film &#956;LED and robust &#956;LED operation under severe environmental stresses.








Abstract
A robust Cu conductor on a glass substrate for thin&#8208;film &#956;LEDs using the flash&#8208;induced chemical/physical interlocking between Cu and glass is reported. During millisecond light irradiation, CuO nanoparticles (NPs) on the display substrate are transformed into a conductive Cu film by reduction and sintering. At the same time, intensive heating at the boundary of CuO NPs and glass chemically induces the formation of an ultrathin Cu2O interlayer within the Cu/glass interface for strong adhesion. Cu nanointerlocking occurs by transient glass softening and interface fluctuation to increase the contact area. Owing to these flash&#8208;induced interfacial interactions, the flash&#8208;activated Cu electrode exhibits an adhesion energy of 10&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2, which is five times higher than that of vacuum&#8208;deposited Cu. An AlGaInP thin&#8208;film vertical &#956;LED (VLED) forms an electrical interconnection with the flash&#8208;induced Cu electrode via an ACF bonding process, resulting in a high optical power density of 41&#160;mW&#160;mm&#8722;2. The Cu conductor enables reliable VLED operation regardless of harsh thermal stress and moisture infiltration under a high&#8208;temperature storage test, temperature humidity test, and thermal shock test. 50 &#215; 50 VLED arrays transferred onto the flash&#8208;induced robust Cu electrode show high illumination yield and uniform distribution of forward voltage, peak wavelength, and device temperature.

         <title>Growing Living Composites with Ordered Microstructures and Exceptional Mechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A paradigm is presented to guide living bacteria to grow bionic mineralized composites. The strategy demonstrates a class of living composites with ordered microstructures and exceptional mechanical properties. This research progress highlights an exciting opportunity for future bionic composite materials by tailoring the interaction or communication between living organisms and 3D&#8208;printed synthetic materials.








Abstract
Living creatures are continuous sources of inspiration for designing synthetic materials. However, living creatures are typically different from synthetic materials because the former consist of living cells to support their growth and regeneration. Although natural systems can grow materials with sophisticated microstructures, how to harness living cells to grow materials with predesigned microstructures in engineering systems remains largely elusive. Here, an attempt to exploit living bacteria and 3D&#8208;printed materials to grow bionic mineralized composites with ordered microstructures is reported. The bionic composites exhibit outstanding specific strength and fracture toughness, which are comparable to natural composites, and exceptional energy absorption capability superior to both natural and artificial counterparts. This report opens the door for 3D&#8208;architectured hybrid synthetic&#8211;living materials with living ordered microstructures and exceptional properties.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionogel electrolytes with a layered heterostructure are developed by Mark C. Hersam and co&#8208;workers in article number 2007864, using hexagonal boron nitride nanoplatelets and two imidazolium ionic liquids with different electrochemical stability windows. Compared with ionogels using the individual ionic liquids, the layered heterostructure ionogels provide broadened electrochemical stability windows while maintaining desirable ionic conductivity, suggesting a promising electrolyte strategy for high operating voltages and rate performance in solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Gas Sensing: Scalable Superior Chemical Sensing Performance of Stretchable Ionotronic Skin via a &#960;&#8208;Hole Receptor Effect (Adv. Mater. 13/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A skin&#8208;attachable chemical sensor showing high sensitivity, selectivity, stability, and even scalability is demonstrated by Ming Liang Jin, Hee&#8208;Tae Jung, Chi Won Ahn, Do Hwan Kim, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2007605, which they term an ionotronic gas&#8208;sensing sticker. Ultimately, the proposed strategy is expected to provide new guidelines for sensing channels for next&#8208;generation wearable gas&#8208;sensor platforms.

Redox co&#8208;mediation provides an effective approach to promote the reaction kinetics of polysulfides in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. In article number 2007298, Jia&#8208;Qi Huang and co&#8208;workers propose an organodiselenide as a redox co&#8208;mediator to accelerate the sulfur redox kinetics. The organodiselenide co&#8208;mediator endows lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries with superb electrochemical performance with high actual energy density of 301 Wh kg&#8722;1. This work inspires further exploration in mediating Li&#8211;S kinetics for practical high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.

         <title>Review on Recent Developments in 2D Ferroelectrics: Theories and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D ferroelectrics are expected to play a dominant role in the upcoming nano era as important functional materials. Relevant theories, as well as intrinsic and extrinsic 2D ferroelectrics, are outlined. Further, the existing challenges and prospects of the exploration in 2D ferroelectrics are also discussed, which should provide unprecedented opportunities in the fields of electronics, spintronics, optoelectronics, and valleytronics.








Abstract
Although only a few 2D materials have been predicted to possess ferroelectricity, 2D ferroelectrics are expected to play a dominant role in the upcoming nano era as important functional materials. The ferroelectric properties of 2D ferroelectrics are significantly different than those of traditional bulk ferroelectrics owing to their intrinsic size and surface effects. To date, 2D&#160;ferroelectrics have been reported to exhibit diverse properties ranging from bulk photovoltaic and piezoelectric/pyroelectric effects to the spontaneous valley and spin polarization. These properties are either dependent on ferroelectric polarization or coupled with it for easy electric control, thus making 2D ferroelectrics applicable to multifunctional nanodevices. At present, cumulative efforts are being made to explore 2D ferroelectrics in theories, experiments, and applications. Herein, such theories and methods are briefly introduced. Subsequently, intrinsic and extrinsic origins of 2D&#160;ferroelectricity are separately summarized. In addition, invented or laboratory&#8208;validated 2D ferroelectric&#8208;based applications are listed. Finally, the existing challenges and prospects of 2D ferroelectrics are discussed.

         <title>Surface and Interface Engineering of Nanoarrays toward Advanced Electrodes and Electrochemical Energy Storage Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A critical overview of surface and interface engineering of 3D nanoarray (3D&#8208;NA) electrodes is provided. The concepts and principles for utilizing 3D&#8208;NAs in purposely designed electrode architectures, charge storage mechanism analysis, and integrated device architecture design are outlined. Future perspectives and solutions to achieve electrode charge balance, multiphase solid&#8208;state interface optimization, and 3D solid electrolyte infiltration are also presented.








Abstract
The overall performance of electrochemical energy storage devices (EESDs) is intrinsically correlated with surfaces and interfaces. As a promising electrode architecture, 3D nanoarrays (3D&#8208;NAs) possess relatively ordered, continuous, and fully exposed active surfaces of individual nanostructures, facilitating mass and electron transport within the electrode and charge transfer across interfaces and providing an ideal platform for engineering. Herein, a critical overview of the surface and interface engineering of 3D&#8208;NAs, from electrode and interface designs to device integration, is presented. The general merits of 3D&#8208;NAs and surface/interface engineering principles of 3D&#8208;NA hybrid electrodes are highlighted. The focus is on the use of 3D&#8208;NAs as a superior platform to regulate the interface nature and unveiling new mechanism/materials without the interference of binders. The engineering and utilization of the surface of 3D&#8208;NAs to develop flexible/solid&#8208;state EESDs with 3D integrated electrode/electrolyte interfaces, or 3D triphase interfaces involving other active species, which are characteristic of (quasi&#8208;)solid&#8208;state electrolyte infiltration into the entire device, are also considered. Finally, the challenges and future directions of surface/interface engineering of 3D&#8208;NAs are outlined. In particular, potential strategies to obtain electrode charge balance, optimize the multiphase solid&#8208;state interface, and attain 3D solid electrolyte infiltration are proposed.

         <title>Fabrication Strategies of Twisted Bilayer Graphenes and Their Unique Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress in fabrication of twisted bilayer graphene by the mainstream methods and the topological physical properties applied in different applications is comprehensively presented. The discovery of killer applications with suitable preparation method for twisted bilayer graphene is systematically discussed by listing the advantages and disadvantages of preparation methods and various applications.








Abstract
Twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) exhibits a host of innovative physical phenomena owing to the formation of moir&#233; superlattice. Especially, the discovery of superconducting behavior has generated new interest in graphene. The growing studies of tBLG mainly focus on its physical properties, while the fabrication of high&#8208;quality tBLG is a prerequisite for achieving the desired properties due to the great dependence on the twist angle and the interfacial contact. Here, the cutting&#8208;edge preparation strategies and challenges of tBLG fabrication are reviewed. The advantages and disadvantages of chemical vapor deposition, epitaxial growth on silicon carbide, stacking monolayer graphene, and folding monolayer graphene methods for the fabrication of tBLG are analyzed in detail, providing a reference for further development of preparation methods. Moreover, the characterization methods of twist angle for the tBLG are presented. Then, the unique physicochemical properties and corresponding applications of tBLG, containing correlated insulating and superconducting states, ferromagnetic state, soliton, enhanced optical absorption, tunable bandgap, and lithium intercalation and diffusion, are described. Finally, the opportunities and challenges for fabricating high&#8208;quality and large&#8208;area tBLG are discussed, unique physical properties are displayed, and new applications inferred from its angle&#8208;dependent features are explored, thereby impelling the commercialization of tBLG from laboratory to market.

         <title>In Search of Excellence: Convex versus Concave Noble Metal Nanostructures for Electrocatalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Concave noble metal nanocrystals represent the new class of electrocatalyst materials. In recent decades, extensive works have been employed in the search for excellent catalyst materials for electrocatalysis applications. The surface defects and structural stability are considered responsible for the superiority of concave noble metals compared to their conventional convex counterparts.








Abstract
Controlling the shape of noble metal nanoparticles is a challenging but important task in electrocatalysis. Apart from hollow and nanocage structures, concave noble metal nanoparticles are considered a new class of unconventional electrocatalysts that exhibit superior electrocatalytic properties as compared with those of conventional nanoparticles (including convex and flat ones). Herein, several facile and highly reproducible routes for synthesizing nanostructured concave noble metal materials reported in the literature are discussed, together with their advantages over noble metal nanoparticles with convex shapes. In addition, possible ways of optimizing the synthesis procedure and enhancing the electrocatalytic characteristics of concave metal nanoparticles are suggested. Nanostructured noble metals with concave features are found to show better catalytic activity and stability hence improve their practical applicability in electrocatalysis.

         <title>A Comprehensive Review on Intracellular Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Existing intracellular delivery approaches are differentiated by their impact resolution to macro&#8208; and micro/nanoengineering strategies. Each method is characterized based on whether it employs a carrier&#8208; or membrane&#8208;disruption&#8208;mediated mechanism to load cargo inside the cell of interest. The applications and future perspectives of micro/nanoscale delivery strategies are discussed.








Abstract
Intracellular delivery is considered an indispensable process for various studies, ranging from medical applications (cell&#8208;based therapy) to fundamental (genome&#8208;editing) and industrial (biomanufacture) approaches. Conventional macroscale delivery systems critically suffer from such issues as low cell viability, cytotoxicity, and inconsistent material delivery, which have opened up an interest in the development of more efficient intracellular delivery systems. In line with the advances in microfluidics and nanotechnology, intracellular delivery based on micro&#8208; and nanoengineered platforms has progressed rapidly and held great promises owing to their unique features. These approaches have been advanced to introduce a smorgasbord of diverse cargoes into various cell types with the maximum efficiency and the highest precision. This review differentiates macro&#8208;, micro&#8208;, and nanoengineered approaches for intracellular delivery. The macroengineered delivery platforms are first summarized and then each method is categorized based on whether it employs a carrier&#8208; or membrane&#8208;disruption&#8208;mediated mechanism to load cargoes inside the cells. Second, particular emphasis is placed on the micro&#8208; and nanoengineered advances in the delivery of biomolecules inside the cells. Furthermore, the applications and challenges of the established and emerging delivery approaches are summarized. The topic is concluded by evaluating the future perspective of intracellular delivery toward the micro&#8208; and nanoengineered approaches.
