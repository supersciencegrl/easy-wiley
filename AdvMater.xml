         <title>Universal Method for Covalent Attachment of Hydrogels to Diverse Polymeric Surfaces for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal, reagent&#8208;free strategy is presented for covalently attaching hydrogels to diverse polymeric substrates through reactive oxygen species. The scalable, linker&#8208;free approach enables robust adhesion and broad material compatibility, advancing the fabrication of hybrid solid&#8211;hydrogel systems for next&#8208;generation biomedical devices and bioprinting applications.








Abstract
Hydrogels, renowned for their biocompatibility and capacity to mimic biological tissues, are integral to many biomedical applications, such as implantable devices and wound dressings. However, their poor mechanical strength and the challenge of achieving durable adhesion to polymeric surfaces have hindered their broader utility. Current methods of creating hybrid solid&#8208;hydrogel (HSH) structures often rely on complex chemical linkers, adding steps, cytotoxic risks, and scalability issues. Here, a novel, reagent&#8208;free method that covalently bonds hydrogels to polymeric substrates directly via reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by an atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ) is introduced. Through an evaporation&#8208;induced enhanced concentration (EIEC) approach, robust hydrogel layers are formed on ROS&#8208;functionalized surfaces, eliminating the need for silane&#8208;based linkers and achieving up to 60&#160;kPa adhesion strength in wet conditions. This strategy offers robust hydrogel adhesion, reduces processing complexity, and preserves cytocompatibility, as demonstrated by the culture of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and THP&#8208;1 derived macrophages with minimal immune response. Applicable across various hydrogels, such as gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA), chitosan, and polymeric substrates, including Teflon, polyethylene, and polycaprolactone (PCL), this dry process holds substantial promise for integration into advanced biomanufacturing systems, such as 3D bioprinters, unlocking new potentials in tissue engineering and biomedical device fabrication.

         <title>Host&#8208;Dependent Tunable Phosphorescence Based on Aromatic Heterocyclic Derivatives: Highly Efficient and Photo&#8208;Activated Ultralong Organic Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient and photo&#8208;activated RTP is achieved by doping aromatic heterocyclic derivatives into different polymers. If they are doped into PAM, PVA, or PAA, the resultant powders exhibit a high phosphorescence efficiency of 66.2% under ambient conditions. If the guests are doped into PDMA or PVP, the resultant films demonstrate photo&#8208;activated room temperature phosphorescence with a long lifetime of 578.6&#160;ms.








Abstract
Achieving high phosphorescence efficiency and photo&#8208;activated ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) based on the same molecule remains a formidable challenge. Here, a concise strategy is proposed to obtain highly efficient and photo&#8208;activated RTP by doping aromatic heterocyclic derivatives into different polymers. Aromatic heterocyclic derivatives are doped into PAM, PVA, or PAA polymers to produce high phosphorescence efficiency. Impressively, the highest phosphorescence quantum yield can reach up to 66.2% at room temperature, which can be attributed to isolating the chromophore to reduce the excimer and the rigid environment from the polymer to restrict the non&#8208;radiative transitions. In addition, phosphorescence emission color can be tailored from green to deep blue by varying the guests. After aromatic heterocyclic derivatives are doped into PDMA or PVP, the phosphorescence lifetime is prolonged from 1.2 to 578.6&#160;ms. These polymers are successfully applied to multicolor displays and high&#8208;level information storage. This work provides a reasonable strategy to develop highly efficient and photo&#8208;activated RTP materials based on the same molecule.

         <title>Diverse Optical Regulations in a Single Electrochromic Layer of V2O5 via an Intrinsic Multiple Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single layer of orthorhombic V2O5 (&#945;&#8208;V2O5) can achieve diverse optical regulations, i.e., blue shift of absorption edge (multi&#8208;color variation) and dual band modulation of both visible and near&#8208;infrared light, via an intrinsic multiple phase transitions upon ion intercalation. This allows the warm mode to be compatible with other modes within a single electrochromic layer.








Abstract
Electrochromic oxides possessing the characteristics of color variation and spectra modulation are desirable for smart windows, displays, and camouflage. Here, it is reported that, upon ion intercalation, a single layer of a model phase&#8208;transition material, V2O5, can possess diverse modulation of visible and near&#8208;infrared spectra while changing color, via intrinsic multiple phase transitions. Specifically, as the phase transitions from &#945; to &#948; occur, the band transitions around 2.94 eV (420 nm) weaken, causing a blue shift in the optical absorption edge within the visible region. Simultaneously, new band transitions at 1.21 eV emerge and intensify, leading to a broad optical absorption centered around 1025 nm. As the phase transition progresses from &#948; to &#947;, the split&#8208;off bands in the &#947; phase fall below the Fermi level, which leads to a near&#8208;infrared transparent nature of &#947;&#8208;LixV2O5. Both absorption edge shifting and dynamically modulating the transmittance in V2O5 are different from other cathodic electrochromic oxides. The color&#8208;changing characteristics, together with selective spectral modulation, inspire the realization of multiple working modes for smart windows. Moreover, the optical constants of refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) at various phases for LixV2O5 are also demonstrated. It is anticipated that multiple and reversible phase transitions, which have not yet been realized, will be the key design principle for achieving superior electrochromic devices.

         <title>Stereochemical Control of Water Transport Properties in Thiol&#8208;yne Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rigorous understanding of thiol&#8208;yne crystallization in a series of stoichiometrically identical stereocontrolled elastomers with variations in cis vs trans backbone stereochemistry provides a path forward to design and utilize structural elements in films for barrier applications. Varying the isomer content in these elastomers directs different temperature and rate dependent crystallization behavior which affords control overmicron&#8208;scale structure.








Abstract
Barrier polymers underpin almost every commercial sector, yet the needs of several emerging areas remain unmet by commercially&#8208;available materials, including temporary orthopedic implants, transient health monitors, neural implants, and other long&#8208;term implants. The ability to tune polymer composition independently of polymer structure positions thiol&#8208;yne click chemistry as a promising platform to serve these emerging technologies. This work describes the differences in the hierarchical structure of stoichiometrically identical materials which differ only in the proportion of the cis versus trans backbone alkene stereochemistry. Varying the isomer content in this way directs different temperature and rate dependent crystallization behavior, which affords control over micron&#8208;scale structure. This investigation focuses on how these stereochemical features affect the water vapor permeation process by several methods and develops an understanding of how this unique structural regularity improves barrier performance relative to a commercially available water barrier polymer, poly(ethylene terephthalate).

         <title>Dynamic Confinement and High&#8208;Entropy Catalytic Synergy Engineering in Hollow Nano&#8208;Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes a generalized dynamic template strategy for the controllable synthesis of H&#8208;MOFs (e.g., ZIF&#8208;67 and Co&#8208;BTC) and systematically investigates the effects of pore size, functional groups, and multimetal synergism on the performance of Li&#8211;S batteries. The study also screens out a high&#8208;performance sulfur&#8208;hosted HE&#8208;MOF&#8208;74. XAFS and in situ characterizations confirm that the hierarchical structure mitigates active material deactivation and host degradation.








Abstract
The systematic regulation of the pore size and chemical environment of nano&#8208;metal&#8208;organic skeletons (n&#8208;MOFs) has been challenged, making it difficult to study their structure&#8208;property relationships in depth. In this study, a universal dynamic template strategy is proposed and successfully achieves the controllable construction of various hollow n&#8208;MOFs (including ZIF&#8208;67, Co&#8208;BTC, etc.). Based on this, the progressive optimization mechanism of pore size limitation (3.4&#8211;18 &#197;), functional group modification (&#9472;H, &#9472;NH2, etc.), and multi&#8208;metal (Co, Ni, etc.) synergism on the performance of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries is systematically revealed, and the long&#8208;cycle&#8208;life sulfur host HE&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 is further screened. The experimental findings and in situ characterizations collectively demonstrate that hierarchical structural optimization synergistically mitigates active material deactivation and host structure degradation. This work not only provides an integrated &#8220;synthesis&#8208;structure&#8208;performance&#8221; material design paradigm for Li&#8211;S batteries, but also provides a theoretical basis for extending the multiscale optimization logic to other multistep reactive systems.

&lt;p&gt;This study proposes a generalized dynamic template strategy for the controllable synthesis of H-MOFs (e.g., ZIF-67 and Co-BTC) and systematically investigates the effects of pore size, functional groups, and multimetal synergism on the performance of Li&#8211;S batteries. The study also screens out a high-performance sulfur-hosted HE-MOF-74. XAFS and in situ characterizations confirm that the hierarchical structure mitigates active material deactivation and host degradation.

         <title>Environmental Control of Ferroelectricity in Hafnia Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversible transition from nonferroelectric to ferroelectric behavior is achieved in hafnia films by modulating the surrounding atmosphere. The domain relaxation dynamics exhibit high sensitivity to environmental factors, including gas composition (ambient, N2, CO2, O2) and relative humidity, highlighting the crucial role of the measurement environment in determining the ferroelectric properties of hafnia films.








Abstract
Ferroelectricity in hafnia films has triggered significant research interest over the past decade due to its immense promise for next&#8208;generation memory devices. However, the origin of ferroic behavior at the nanoscale and the means to control it remain an open question, with the consensus being that it deviates from conventional ferroelectrics. In this work, a novel approach is presented to tune ferroelectric properties of hafnia through environmental control using piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). A reversible transition from non&#8208;ferroelectric to ferroelectric behavior by modulating the surrounding atmosphere is demonstrated. Notably, the domain relaxation dynamics exhibit striking sensitivity to environmental factors, including ambient conditions, specific gas compositions (N2, CO2, O2), and humidity levels. The critical role of surface water removal, gas molecule adsorption, and their interactions with near&#8208;surface oxygen vacancies is identified and the injected charge in determining ferroelectricity in uncapped hafnia films. These insights reveal a significant strategy for stabilizing ferroic responses by carefully regulating the chemical environment, offering new possibilities for precise control in hafnia&#8208;based films.

         <title>Advances and Strategies in Enhancing mRNA Cancer Vaccines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines offer a powerful approach for cancer immunotherapy, but their clinical impact remains limited by delivery challenges and suboptimal immune activation. This review discusses key biological barriers and design strategies&#8212;including structural optimization, immunomodulation, organ targeting delivery, and advanced nanocarriers&#8212;to enhance vaccine efficacy. Emerging innovations and translational challenges are highlighted to guide next&#8208;generation mRNA cancer vaccine development.








Abstract
Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine has emerged as a promising strategy in cancer immunotherapy, enabling the induction of precise and robust immune responses against tumor antigens. Nevertheless, enormous challenges remain, in particular its limitations in achieving optimal immunogenicity and therapeutic efficacy, result in modest clinical benefit. Here, the biological barriers are reviewed that impede the functionality of mRNA cancer vaccine and describe the design considerations, including structure engineering, chemical modification, and development of next&#8208;generation delivery materials for enhancing cancer immunotherapy. Recent advances are highlighted aimed at improving vaccine efficacy through targeted delivery, modulation of immune cell interactions, and stimulation of innate immune responses. Finally, the challenges are examined in clinical translation and explore future directions for improving the therapeutic potential of mRNA cancer vaccines. By synthesizing current progress and identifying critical hurdles, this review provides a framework for advancing mRNA&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Artificial Intelligence&#8208;Driven Nanoarchitectonics for Smart Targeted Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective introduces an artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;driven nanoarchitectonics framework for targeted drug delivery, combining database&#8208;guided nanocarrier design, machine learning (ML)&#8208;assisted surface engineering with a designed targeting system, and in silico modeling for dynamic optimization. This integrated strategy enables the development of programmable, responsive, and adaptive delivery systems, offering a transformative approach to overcoming translational barriers in precision nanomedicine.








Abstract
The development of data&#8208;driven and targeted drug delivery systems is essential for advancing precision therapeutics. Despite substantial progress in nanocarrier development, conventional platforms continue to face major challenges in clinical translation due to biological complexity, off&#8208;target accumulation, and limited adaptability to dynamic physiological environments. The integration of nanoarchitectonics and artificial intelligence (AI) offers an advanced strategy for engineering delivery systems that are structurally programmable, stimuli&#8208;responsive, and autonomously optimized. Nanoarchitectonics enables the construction of hierarchical nanostructures with precise spatial and temporal control, while AI facilitates modeling, prediction, and iterative optimization throughout the development pipeline. In this perspective, an AI&#8208;driven nanoarchitectonics framework is introduced for targeted drug delivery, structured around three key phases: 1) molecular target identification through bioinformatic profiling, 2) machine learning (ML)&#8208;guided surface engineering to enhance targeting specificity, and 3) in silico modeling of delivery dynamics and systemic distribution. Drawing on recent advances and representative case studies, how AI tools are illustrated, from generative design algorithms to predictive pharmacokinetic models, are transforming the field from empirical formulation toward mechanism&#8208;informed and AI&#8208;driven intelligent design. By highlighting current limitations and outlining future directions for the integration of AI and nanoarchitectonics, are concluded with a focus on enabling clinically translatable nanomedicine platforms.

         <title>Unlocking the Ligand&#8208;Dominated Redox Activity in &#960;&#8211;d Conjugated Coordination Polymers for High&#8208;Capacity and Stable Potassium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through precise d&#8208;orbital optimization, a novel Ni&#8208;based coordination polymer, Ni&#8208;BTA, is synthesized for potassium&#8208;ion battery anodes. The engineered electronic structure, featuring strong Ni2&#8314;&#8211;ligand &#960;&#8211;d conjugation, enhances the stability of the organic framework by strengthening C&#9552;N bonds. This structural reinforcement enables highly reversible electrochemical processes and contributes to the material's exceptional cycling performance and high capacity.








Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) offer a cost&#8208;effective, resource&#8208;abundant alternative to lithium&#8208;ion systems, yet the development of high&#8208;performance anodes with adequate capacity, stability, and rate capability remains a major challenge. Here, an electronic structure engineering strategy is introduced via d&#8208;orbital configuration optimization in a novel class of &#960;&#8211;d conjugated coordination polymers (TM&#8208;BTA, TM = Ni, Co, Mn). Orbital&#8208;level and charge density analyses reveal that the metal center's electronic configuration governs metal&#8211;ligand interaction strength, thereby modulating charge delocalization and ligand redox behavior. Among the series, Ni2&#8314; exhibits the strongest &#960;&#8211;d conjugation with nitrogen donor atoms, stabilizing C&#9552;N bonds and enabling highly reversible C&#9552;N/C&#9472;N transformations as the dominant redox process. This optimized coordination lowers the K&#8314; adsorption energy barrier by 44% compared to Co2&#8314; and Mn2&#8314;, markedly improving kinetics. As a result, Ni&#8208;BTA delivers a high reversible capacity of 452&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 with 99.2% retention over 500 cycles at 100&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1, and maintains 292&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 4,000 cycles at 1,000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1. In situ spectroscopy and DFT calculations reveal a ligand&#8208;centered three&#8208;electron redox mechanism, where nitrogen heterocycles dominate K&#8314; storage and electrochemically inert Ni centers maintain structural integrity. This work establishes a general design principle for KIB anodes via d&#8208;orbital engineering in coordination polymers.

         <title>Unveiling the Mutual Promotion Mechanism of Adjacent Vacancy Defects Enables High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals the mutual promotion of adjacent cation and anion vacancies in perovskite, and further develops a passivation strategy to synchronously passivate perovskite defects using a new additive of 2&#8208;hydrazinylpyrazine. The PSCs with active areas of 0.08 and 1 cm2 achieve champion PCEs of 26.28% and 24.71%, retaining 93% efficiency after 1700 h under 1&#8208;sun illumination.








Abstract
The perovskite defect evolution directly impacts the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, the mutual promotion mechanism of adjacent cation and anion vacancies in perovskite is unveiled, which means the cation/anion vacancy induces the adjacent anion/cation vacancy through decreasing the formation energy. This mutual promotion mechanism provides an explanation for the dynamic evolution of defects, and emphasizes the necessity of simultaneously passivating of adjacent defects. Accordingly, a new additive of 2&#8208;hydrazinylpyrazine is utilized to passivate adjacent defects, considering its adjacent electron&#8208;rich N atom, which can chemically bond uncoordinated Pb, and the hydrazine group, which can anchor FA+ through hydrogen bonds. Besides, this 2&#8208;hydrazinylpyrazine also optimizes the perovskite crystallization through accelerating nucleation and slowing crystal growth, demonstrated by the in situ photoluminescence spectra. The resulting inverted 0.08 cm2 and 1 cm2 PSCs obtain PCEs of 26.28% and 24.71%, respectively. Moreover, the Target device shows enhanced stability by maintaining 93% and 90% of the initial efficiency after operating 1700 h under 1&#8208;sun illumination and being exposed to harsh thermal cycling for 150 times, respectively.

         <title>A Dipole&#8208;Engineered Electrolyte Paradigm to Overcome Desolvation Barriers for Exceptional Ultralow&#8208;Temperature Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our dipole&#8208;engineered electrolyte paradigm establishes an innovative approach beyond prevailing ion&#8208;dipole modulation framework, offering a generic&#8208;methodology for ultralow&#8208;temperature electrolyte design.








Abstract
Electrochemical energy storage (EES) devices often exhibit poor low&#8208;temperature performance due to high interfacial desolvation energy barriers. While conventional strategies targeting ion&#8208;dipole interactions have improved desolvation kinetics, they suffer from a fundamental trade&#8208;off with bulk&#8208;phase ion diffusion. Here, a dipole&#8208;engineered electrolyte paradigm is proposed to overcome desolvation barriers for enhanced ultralow&#8208;temperature energy storage. Following this new paradigm, a weakly&#8208;dipolar&#8208;interacting electrolyte (WDIE) is developed by regulating dipole&#8211;dipole interactions within ionic solvates between primary and co&#8208;solvents. Through comprehensive experimental characterization and theoretical analyses, the interplay between dipole&#8211;dipole interactions and solvation dynamics across both interfacial and bulk phases is elucidated. Specifically, WDIE transforms the ionic solvate from conventional double&#8208;layer to distinctive mono&#8208;layer with attenuated solvent coordination number, effectively lowering solvent residence time and desolvation energy barriers. Simultaneously, it promotes solvent cluster dissociation, disrupting cross&#8208;linked electrolyte networks and enhancing bulk ion diffusion. As a proof of concept, WDIE&#8208;based supercapacitors exhibit optimized ultralow temperature performance, which retain 97.15% capacity from 20 to &#8722;70 &#176;C, surpassing moderately&#8208; and strongly&#8208;dipolar&#8208;interacting electrolytes and ranking among the best reported. Moreover, theoretical calculations further demonstrate the broad applicability of this strategy when ionic radius exceeds 3.84 &#197;. This work demonstrates a scalable dipole&#8208;engineered electrolyte paradigm to overcome low&#8208;temperature EES limitations.

         <title>A Real&#8208;Time Solar UVA Dose Monitor Based on Recyclable Azobenzene&#8208;Containing Elastomer Fabrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the self&#8208;synthesized main&#8208;chain azobenzene thermoplastic polyurethane (Az&#8208;TPU), a real&#8208;time solar UV dose monitoring device is developed. This device exhibits high performance, recyclability, and strain&#8208;insensitivity, enabling the conversion of solar UVA signals into real&#8208;time signals transmitted via a smartphone application, demonstrating promising potential for broad practical applications.








Abstract
Solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation, a primary cause of skin cancer and erythema, poses irreversible risks to human health, underscoring the urgent need for advanced solar UV detector. Herein, we present a novel intrinsically flexible UVA detector featuring real&#8208;time monitoring, high performance and recyclability. This breakthrough is achieved through engineered oriented composite fabrics combining main&#8208;chain azobenzene&#8208;thermoplastic polyurethane elastomers (Az&#8208;TPU) with piezoelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene) [P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)] nanogenerators. The molecular architecture employs azobenzene groups and 4,4&#8242;&#8208;methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) as hard segment, while polytetramethylene ether glycol (PTMG) forms the soft segment. The physical cross&#8208;linking network and homogeneous microphase&#8208;separated structure enables the fabrics to generate substantial internal stress, resulting in superior photoelectrical conversion capabilities. The device we report achieves an 80 ms response time and maintains excellent linear correlation (R2 = 0.997) across a broad light intensity range (0.05&#8211;50 mW&#183;cm&#8722;2). Remarkably, the fabric achieves dynamic UV light monitoring when subjected to a tensile strain of 10%. Integrated with Bluetooth communication, the device enables real&#8208;time data transmission to mobile devices for continuous UVA intensity and dose monitoring throughout daily sunlight exposure. With demonstrated capability for solar UVA measurement, this technology presents significant industrial potential for wearable solar UV monitoring systems.

         <title>Naphthalene&#8208; and Perylene&#8208;Diimide&#8208;Based Chiral Supramolecular Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically outlines recent advances in designing chiral supramolecular architectures based on naphthalene diimide and perylene diimide (PDI). It categorizes structures (macrocycles, cages, aggregates, crystalline frameworks) and details chirality sources (covalent chiral modification, intrinsic PDI core distortion, exogenous induction). Key applications in circularly polarized luminescence, optoelectronic detectors, and asymmetric catalysis are highlighted.








Abstract
Chiral supramolecular architectures based on naphthalene diimide (NDI) and perylene diimide (PDI) possess significant potential for chiroptical applications due to their physical properties, including large molar extinction coefficient, high fluorescence quantum yield, reversible redox activity, and robust photochemical/thermal stability. The chirality of NDI/PDI&#8208;based supramolecular architectures primarily originates from three sources: i) covalent modification of NDI/PDI with chiral substituents, ii) intrinsic axial chirality through distortion of the PDI conjugated plane, and iii) supramolecular asymmetric assembly of achiral NDI/PDI induced by exogenous chiral environments. This review systematically outlines recent advancements in the design principles of NDI/PDI&#8208;based chiral supramolecular architectures, including macrocycles, cages, aggregates, and crystalline frameworks, with an emphasis on the structure&#8211;activity relationship for chirality induction, transmission, and amplification. Advancements for their functional applications in circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), optoelectronic detectors, and asymmetric catalysis are also listed. Despite such progress, challenges persist in expanding the diversity of chiral NDI/PDI motifs, regulating the weak interactions for chiral supramolecular structures, elucidating chirality transfer and amplification mechanisms, and realizing diverse chiral applications. This review provides a comprehensive guide for the rational design of NDI/PDI&#8208;based chiral supramolecular architectures, facilitating their full exploitation in next&#8208;generation chiral technologies, like CPL light&#8208;emitting diode and chiral biomedicine.

         <title>General Prelithiation Approaches and the Corresponding Full Cell Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prelithiation boosts the electrochemical performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries by compensating for lithium loss. This review integrates the synergistic effects of prelithiation of each component in full cells. Additionally, the kinetic challenges of prelithiation in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries are summarized. Finally, the prelithiation strategy is extended to other premetallation designs, providing guidance for the establishment of high&#8208;energy and high&#8208;safety energy storage systems.








Abstract
Prelithiation technology is widely regarded as an effective strategy to enhance the energy density and extend the cycle life of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). The principle of prelithiation is to introduce additional active Li+, thereby compensating for Li losses during initial charging and long&#8208;term cycling. However, the current summaries of various prelithiation approaches are predominantly focused on liquid LIBs, with limited reviews available on solid&#8208;state LIBs. Compared to liquid LIBs, solid&#8208;state LIBs not only face uniformity issues caused by the uneven mixing of active materials and Li sources during prelithiation, but also encounter severe kinetic challenges arising from rigid solid&#8211;solid interface contact. Here, various prelithiation techniques are first integrated and the dynamic correlation between the prelithiation of each component in a full cell and its electrochemical performance is systematically introduced. Furthermore, the challenges of prelithiation techniques in solid&#8208;state LIBs in terms of solid&#8211;solid interface and Li+ transport are discussed. Finally, these prelithiation technologies are expected to be extended to the design of other premetallation agents, which guide the development of high&#8208;energy and high&#8208;safety energy storage systems.

The principle of prelithiation is to introduce additional active Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, thereby compensating for Li losses during initial charging and long-term cycling. However, the current summaries of various prelithiation approaches are predominantly focused on liquid LIBs, with limited reviews available on solid-state LIBs. Compared to liquid LIBs, solid-state LIBs not only face uniformity issues caused by the uneven mixing of active materials and Li sources during prelithiation, but also encounter severe kinetic challenges arising from rigid solid&#8211;solid interface contact. Here, various prelithiation techniques are first integrated and the dynamic correlation between the prelithiation of each component in a full cell and its electrochemical performance is systematically introduced. Furthermore, the challenges of prelithiation techniques in solid-state LIBs in terms of solid&#8211;solid interface and Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport are discussed. Finally, these prelithiation technologies are expected to be extended to the design of other premetallation agents, which guide the development of high-energy and high-safety energy storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Covalent Tridentate Molecule Anchoring Enhances Nickel Oxide for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiOx suffers from high surface defects and an energy level mismatch with perovskite. Conventional organic modifiers, limited by weak binding, fail to deliver effective surface passivation and energy level regulation. We design [4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]triethoxysilane (3F&#8208;PTES), forming strong tridentate bonds with NiOx to reduce surface defects, while its terminal dipole group optimizes energy alignment, enabling efficient p&#8208;i&#8208;n perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Nickel oxide (NiOx) is a promising hole transport material for perovskite solar cells, but its high surface defect density and energy level mismatch with perovskite limit&#160;device efficiency. Conventional organic surface modifiers, relying on weak hydrogen bonds or single covalent bonds, fail to anchor stably to NiOx, hindering their functional effectiveness. Here, A multidentate anchoring organic molecule, [4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]triethoxysilane (3F&#8208;PTES), is presented, forming robust tridentate covalent bonds with the NiOx surface and significantly enhances interfacial binding strength and surface coverage compared with conventional groups (e.g., carboxyl). As a result, the interfacial defect density is reduced by 2.5&#8208;fold compared with carboxyl&#8208;modified counterparts and significantly suppresses the deprotonation reaction between NiOx and perovskite, thereby greatly improving interfacial contact. The designed trifluoromethyl terminal group further enables precise tuning of NiOx energy levels, achieving near&#8208;ideal band alignment with perovskite (energy offset &#916;E = 0.01&#160;eV). Incorporating this modified NiOx into inverted devices, a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.47% is achieved, along with outstanding operational stability, retaining 97% of their initial efficiency after 1500 h&#160;of continuous operation under maximum power point tracking (65&#160;&#176;C, 60% relative humidity, AM 1.5G illumination, ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;3 protocol).

         <title>Closed&#8208;Pore Engineering in Double&#8208;Layer Textiles for Adaptive Thermal and Moisture Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Foam&#8208;TEX textile is developed through an integrated back&#8208;weft weaving and in situ foaming process, creating an interlocking double&#8208;layer textile with a closed&#8208;pore microstructure. This material has low thermal conductivity (0.039 W/(m&#8901;K)), excellent water resistance and moisture transport (one&#8208;way transport index: 1082%; WVT &gt; 4000 g/(m2&#183;24h)), and maintains stable under extreme temperatures (&#8211;196 to 100&#160;&#176;C), deformation, and washing.








Abstract
Protective textiles face a critical challenge in cold and moisture&#8208;rich environments, in which conventional layered clothing systems and multi&#8208;layer functional textiles often sacrifice breathability and comfort to enhance insulation, or conversely, lose body heat with moisture accumulation. Here, back&#8208;weft weaving technology is combined with an in situ foaming process to produce an interlocking double&#8208;layer textile (Foam&#8208;TEX) featuring abundant closed&#8208;pore microspheres on the foamed fibers and gradient pores throughout the textile. The closed&#8208;pore structural engineering spatially couples the closed&#8208;pore insulation unit with the gradient vapor transmission channel to ensure thermal comfort in cold environments, while effectively preventing heat loss caused by the degradation of insulation performance due to sweat in extremely cold working conditions. As a result, the closed&#8208;pore microstructure provides a low thermal conductivity of 0.039 W/(m&#183;K). Meanwhile, the gradient pores create Laplace pressure difference during water diffusion, driving unidirectional moisture transport and achieving excellent one&#8208;way transport index (1082%) and moisture permeability (&gt;4000 g/(m2&#183;24h)). Foam&#8208;TEX also demonstrates excellent stability under alternating extreme temperature conditions (&#8211;196 to 100&#160;&#176;C), washing, and wringing. This approach provides a flexible and scalable platform to extend the capabilities of Foam&#8208;TEX (e.g., Joule heating) to accommodate a variety of extreme wearing scenarios.

         <title>Solar Trap&#8208;Adsorption Photocathode for Highly Stable 2.4&#160;V Dual&#8208;Ion Solid&#8208;State Iodine Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel organic||I2 battery system with a photo&#8208;assisted mechanism is developed. This design offers accelerated iodine conversion kinetics, enhanced utilization of iodine ions, avoided polyiodide's shuttle, and four&#8208;electron reaction mechanism for iodine species conversion. Leveraging the above merits, the photo&#8208;assisted PTCDI||I2 battery delivers a high energy density of 0.66&#160;mWh&#160;cm&#8722;2 alongside remarkable long&#8208;term cycling durability and excellent bending capability.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous iodine&#8208;based electrochemical energy storage systems offer a cost&#8208;effective alternative to conventional alkali metal batteries for grid&#8208;scale applications. However, their practical deployment is hindered by sluggish iodine redox kinetics and the shuttle of polyiodides, which severely limit their lifespan. To address these challenges, a novel solid&#8208;state organic||I2 battery leveraging a Co3O4&#8208;TiO2 heterojunction photocathode is developed. By integrating a photo&#8208;assisted mechanism with an innovative device architecture, the system achieves accelerated iodine conversion kinetics, enhances iodide ion utilization, and enables a four&#8208;electron redox pathway. Theoretical calculation combined with electrochemical analysis reveals that the photo&#8208;assisted mechanism promotes electrostatic adsorption of polyiodides, accelerates interfacial charge transfer, and significantly improves iodine redox kinetics. As a result, the organic||I2 battery delivers a high specific capacity of 1.36&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, a discharge voltage of 2.4&#160;V, and excellent cycle stability over 1000 cycles, retaining 80.9% of its capacity at a current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. This photo&#8208;enhanced battery exhibits strong competitiveness compared to previously reported iodine&#8208;based batteries. The remarkable performance of this photo&#8208;assisted prototype offers a sustainable and cost&#8208;effective solution for next&#8208;generation energy storage.

         <title>Sustained Continuous&#8208;Wave Lasing in Quantum Dot Microfluids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sustained continuous&#8208;wave lasing in colloidal quantum dots is achieved by leveraging a novel microfluidic dot&#8208;in&#8208;matrix strategy. The novel QD microfluidic platform enables the first demonstration of 6 excitons per QD under cw excitation and hence simultaneous two&#8208;band cw stimulated emission from both the 1S and 1P states. These results open the first&#8208;ever cw QD laser device relevant for practical applications.








Abstract
Sustained amplified stimulated emission (ASE) under continuous&#8208;wave (cw) excitation is a prerequisite for any new gain material being developed for lasing applications. Despite the great success achieved in colloidal quantum dot (QD) lasers, the cw light amplification is hampered by the high pump threshold and thermal effects of QD solids. Herein, the first&#8208;ever cw ASE and lasing from QDs relevant for practical implementations are realized by adopting the microfluidic dot&#8208;in&#8208;matrix design. Leveraging on the transient and steady&#8208;state gain spectroscopy, it is demonstrated that the high&#8208;concentration dispersed QDs with a gain feature customized for cw pumping render the low pump threshold (&#8776;340 W&#160;cm&#8722;2). Meanwhile, the QD micro&#8208;liquids effectively dissipate the heat arising from the nonradiative multi&#8208;carrier recombination. As such, the unprecedented two&#8208;band cw ASE and long&#8208;lasting cw lasing with coherent output beam are realized. The findings open the door to practical QD lasers and may unlock new possibilities in optofluidics and optoelectronics.

         <title>p&#8208;Block Metal&#8208;Based Catalysts: Hidden Gems for Hydrogen Peroxide Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advances in p&#8208;block metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for H2O2 synthesis, covering catalyst design, performance optimization, and comparison to noble and transition metals, outlining reaction mechanisms by a synthesis of DFT calculations reported in the literature. Considering the merits and limitations of different metals, it outlines key challenges, actionable strategies, and future prospects for the field.








Abstract
Electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) offers a sustainable alternative for the traditional anthraquinone method. p&#8208;block metals exhibit unique electronic structures and tunable surface properties, showing great potential in 2e&#8722; ORR. However, a systematic review focusing on recent progress in p&#8208;block metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for H2O2 synthesis is lacking. To fill the gap, this work first shows a marked increase in p&#8208;block metal research over the past decade by bibliometric analysis of over 300 publications. Research on 2e&#8722; ORR has surged since 2019, while research on 2e&#8210; water oxidation reaction (WOR) has declined. Strategies for the synthesis and optimization of various p&#8208;block metal&#8208;based catalysts are discussed in detail. Based on a synthesis of DFT calculations in the literature, the reaction mechanisms of p&#8208;block metal catalysis proceeding are summarized via a 2e&#8722; pathway. Finally, considering the merits and limitations of different metals, this review outlines the primary challenges and future directions in this area, emphasizing the importance of improving catalyst stability, deepening mechanistic understanding, and developing cost&#8208;effective synthesis methods. It also offers novel perspectives on the engineering of p&#8208;block metal&#8208;based catalysts and promotes the development of sustainable H2O2 electrosynthesis technologies.

         <title>Inverted Device Engineering for Efficient and Bright Quantum Rod LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Equivalent circuit model and micro&#8208;surface analysis prove that horizontally aligned rod&#8208;in&#8208;rod quantum rods films (82% in&#8208;plane dipoles) enable high outcoupling yet suffer from carrier leakage within the conventional device structure. An inverted device structure suppresses carrier leakage and achieves 31% and 20.2 % EQE in red and green QR&#8208;LEDs, respectively, unlocking the potential of anisotropic nanocrystals.








Abstract
Quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QD&#8208;LEDs) have approached the theoretical limit of external quantum efficiency (EQE) determined by outcoupling efficiency. To achieve further improvements, novel optical designs must be explored, such as constructing optical microcavities, utilizing light scattering, or tuning the orientation of transition dipole moments (TDM). This study reports advances in red rod&#8208;in&#8208;rod quantum rods (QRs) film that exhibits a high in&#8208;plane dipole orientation of 82%, achieved through shape&#8208;induced horizontal self&#8208;alignment. Also a critical issue is discovered: the carrier leakage through irregular quantum rod films, which hinders the EQE of quantum rod light&#8208;emitting diodes (QR&#8208;LEDs) and limits its competitiveness with QD&#8208;LEDs. An equivalent circuit model comprising two diodes clearly illustrates the impacts of the leakage current within conventional QR&#8208;LED structures. By transforming the QR&#8208;LEDs device structure, balanced carrier injection and suppressed leakage current are simultaneously enhanced, achieving a red QR&#8208;LEDs with a peak EQE of 31% and a peak brightness of 110&#8201;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. Additionally, these strategies are applied to green dot&#8208;in&#8208;rod QRs, demonstrating a peak EQE of 20.2% with ultra&#8208;high luminance of 250&#8201;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. This work is expected to pave the way for further improvements in the LED performance based on anisotropic nanocrystals.

         <title>Electrically&#8208;Driven 2D Semiconductor Microcavity Laser</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first electrically&#8208;driven 2D semiconductor microcavity laser is achieved at room temperature under AC voltage driving conditions. The demonstration of the compact 2D TMDC laser establishes a new area of research to assist with the implementation of diverse 2D material&#8208;based practical photonic devices and integrated circuits in the future.








Abstract
2D monolayered transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are promising materials for realizing ultracompact, low&#8208;threshold semiconductor lasers. And the development of the electrical&#8208;driven TMDC devices is crucial for enhancing the integration potential of practical optoelectronic systems. However, at the current stage, the electrically&#8208;driven 2&#8208;D TMDC laser has never been realized. Herein, the first electrically&#8208;driven 2&#8208;D TMDC microcavity laser have been developed. In this device, an alternating current (AC) generates electroluminescence lasing in suspended monolayered WSe2 integrated on a microdisk cavity. The input&#8211;output curve, bandwidth narrowing, and second&#8208;order coherence is analyzed to confirm the lasing characteristics at room temperature. The realization of the room&#8208;temperature AC&#8208;driven 2&#8208;D TMDC laser establishes a new area of research on electrically pumped compact lasers and is likely to assist with the implementation of diverse TMDC&#8208;based practical photonic devices in the future.

         <title>Two&#8208;Stage Bipolaron Formation in Molecularly Doped Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work investigates bipolaron formation in 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ)&#8208;doped conjugated polymer P(g32T&#8208;T) films with glycol sidechains at two stages of both low and high doping levels. At the early stage, bipolarons mainly form from double doping, enhancing structural ordering, and carrier transport. In contrast, late&#8208;stage bipolarons, mostly generated by polaron combination, exhibit adverse effects on those properties.








Abstract
The formation and dynamics of bipolarons are crucial in determining the electrical properties of molecularly doped conjugated polymers. Traditionally, bipolarons are known to form at very high doping levels through the combination of two adjacent polarons, a process that is generally accompanied by structural disorder and impaired carrier transport. Here, it is demonstrated that bipolaron formation can occur at both the early stage with low doping levels and the late stage with high doping levels in 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) dip&#8208;doped conjugated polymer films with glycol sidechains. Bipolaron formation at the early stage is discovered to be mainly associated with double doping, which is uncommon in conventional doped polymer systems. In contrast, bipolaron formation at the late stage is dominated by combining two polarons. Furthermore, these bipolarons are observed to behave differently: early&#8208;stage bipolarons generated through double doping enhance both the molecular ordering and carrier transport, whereas late&#8208;stage bipolarons resulting from polaron combination occur alongside detrimental effects in structural and transport properties. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of bipolaron formation across different doping levels and underscore the potential for optimizing doping strategies. A deeper understanding of bipolarons can guide the design of next&#8208;generation molecularly doped conjugated polymers with improved performance.

         <title>Reversing the Reaction Order Between FA+ and Rb+ Enhances the Photovoltaic Performance of Blade&#8208;Coated Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
5&#8208;hydroperoxy&#8208;1&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidinone (HMP) retards Rb+ reaction with the Pb&#8208;I framework, enabling Rb&#8314; occupation at the A&#8208;site cation position. This allows Rb&#8314; to alloy with formamidinium (FA), stabilizing the perovskite lattice and reducing strain. HMP boosts perovskite photovoltaic cell efficiency to a record 25.8% and enhances harsh&#8208;environment stability, offering a novel approach to regulate crystallization kinetics. 








Abstract
Manipulating the kinetics of the reaction between A&#8208;site cations and Pb&#8208;I frameworks holds paramount importance for achieving high&#8208;quality, phase&#8208;homogeneous FA&#8208;dominant perovskites. It has been observed that when rubidium (Rb) serves as an A&#8208;site cation dopant, it tends to accumulate in the bulk region of the perovskite structure due to its pronounced affinity for Pb&#8208;I frameworks compared to FA+. Consequently, Rb+ ions struggle to alleviate the exaggerated tensile strain induced by the bulky FA cations on the perovskite surface. To mitigate this challenge, 5&#8208;hydroperoxy&#8208;1&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidinone (HMP) is introduced as an additive to invert the sequence between FA+ and Rb+ in reaction with the Pb&#8208;I frameworks. The introduction of HMP effectively stabilizes Rb+ cations within the perovskite lattice, leading to a surface enriched with Rb that exhibits diminished lattice strain and defects. Finally, a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.8% for 0.09 cm2 perovskite solar cells and 19.8% for 52 cm2 mini&#8208;module is achieved, which are fabricated via blade coating under ambient conditions with a relative humidity of &#8804;55%. Notably, these cells exhibit minimal hysteresis and demonstrate significantly enhanced resilience against illumination, dampness, and heat.

&lt;p&gt;5-hydroperoxy-1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (HMP) retards Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; reaction with the Pb-I framework, enabling Rb&#8314; occupation at the A-site cation position. This allows Rb&#8314; to alloy with formamidinium (FA), stabilizing the perovskite lattice and reducing strain. HMP boosts perovskite photovoltaic cell efficiency to a record 25.8% and enhances harsh-environment stability, offering a novel approach to regulate crystallization kinetics.

         <title>Permeable, Wet&#8208;Adhesive, and EMI&#8208;Resistant Liquid Metal Electronic Skin for High&#8208;Fidelity Electrophysiological Monitoring in Sweaty and Electromagnetic Environments</title>

         <dc:description>
A breathable, wet&#8208;adhesive, and EMI&#8208;resistant textile&#8208;based e&#8208;skin is developed to enable stable, high&#8208;fidelity electrophysiological monitoring under humid and high&#8208;interference conditions. By integrating oxidation&#8208;resistant liquid metal inks, a conductive sandwich textile structure, and a permeable adhesive layer, the e&#8208;skin offers a promising solution to the adhesion&#8211;breathability trade&#8208;off in next&#8208;generation wearable bioelectronics.








Abstract
Textile&#8208;based e&#8208;skins possess outstanding permeability, flexibility, and biocompatibility, making them ideal for wearable health monitoring and human&#8211;machine interfaces. However, the intrinsic trade&#8208;off between breathability and adhesiveness poses a major challenge to maintaining a stable and comfortable skin&#8211;electrode interface. This often results in elevated interfacial impedance, signal artifacts, and reduced signal fidelity under extreme conditions. Herein, a breathable, wet&#8208;adhesive, and electromagnetic interference (EMI)&#8208;resistant textile&#8208;based e&#8208;skin is engineered for stable and high&#8208;fidelity electrophysiological monitoring, particularly in sweaty and strong electromagnetic environments. Liquid metal particles (LMPs) are encapsulated within polysaccharide molecules to prevent surface oxidation and enhance printability. The conductive ink is directly patterned onto a sandwich&#8208;structured textile substrate, which integrates a wet&#8208;adhesive yet permeable fibrous layer, and an EMI&#8208;shielding interlayer coated with silver nanoparticles. The resulting e&#8208;skin demonstrates excellent permeability (1439.1&#160;&#177;&#160;13.3&#160;g&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;day&#8722;1), strong wet adhesion (2.1&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;2), and robust EMI shielding effectiveness (&gt;50&#160;dB in the X&#8208;band), these advantages collectively empower comfortable, stable, and high&#8208;fidelity acquisition of various electrophysiological signals including electrocardiography (ECG), electroencephalography (EEG), visual evoked potentials (VEP), and electrooculography (EOG), even in humid and EMI conditions. This functional synergy represents a key innovation that enhances long&#8208;term stability and fidelity in complex, real&#8208;world bio&#8208;monitoring scenarios.

         <title>Opto&#8208;Ion&#8208;Exchange Enabled Active Swarming System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;regulated swarm intelligence system is developed through the integration of ionic communication and photochemical regulation, successfully replicating predator&#8208;prey ecological dynamics. This platform demonstrates spatiotemporally programmable collective behaviors through light modulation, including enhanced motility, reversible aggregation, repulsion, and distinct reactive states. This intelligent swarm design paradigm opens new avenues for smart collective robotics and applications in environmental remediation and beyond.








Abstract
Swarming behavior often enables systems to achieve intelligent responses that surpass the capabilities of individual components, allowing for complex tasks to be accomplished. Despite significant advances in active swarm research, achieving precise control over swarm responsiveness remains a challenge. In this study, a light&#8208;controlled chemical communication&#8208;mediated swarming system through integrating the ion&#8208;exchange and light decomposition reactions to emulate predator&#8208;prey interactions is designed. In this system, ion exchange resin particles (acting as &#8220;predators&#8221;) actively approach and aggregate silver phosphate (Ag3PO4) nanoparticles (acting as &#8220;prey&#8221;), which in turn exhibit light&#8208;triggered escape responses driven by photodecomposition&#8208;induced ionic gradients. These swarms exhibit a range of novel, light&#8208;modulated dynamic behaviors, including enhanced motility, reversible aggregation, repulsion, and distinct reactive states. These behaviors provide valuable insights into active swarm dynamics. Furthermore, the synergistic effects of the collective swarming, active interactions, and light&#8208;induced Ag&#8314; production establish a robust antibacterial platform capable of rapid and efficient bacterial eradication. This intelligent swarm design presents new possibilities for the development of multifunctional, responsive swarms, offering valuable applications in environmental treatment and beyond.

A biphasic Ni&#8208;MXene quantum&#8208;confined nanostructure (Ni&#8208;MJQD) serves as a Janus platform, simultaneously achieving high&#8208;performance energy storage and efficient catalytic oxidation. The unique architecture enables superior energy storage performance and selective benzyl alcohol oxidation&#8208;symbolizing &#8220;one stone, two birds&#8221; for sustainable energy and catalysis.








Abstract
The demand for sustainable energy storage and ecofriendly catalysts has intensified the search for advanced multifunctional materials. Herein, this work presents the synthesis and characterization of Janus Ni&#8208;MXene quantum dot (Ni&#8208;MJQD), a novel material architecture that exhibits high performance in supercapacitor and catalytic applications. A Ni&#8208;MJQD cathode delivers an impressive gravimetric specific capacity of 168.75 mAh g&#8722;1 at 3 A g&#8722;1, and its Janus structure optimizes the balance between capacity and ion diffusion. In an asymmetric hybrid supercapacitor (AHSC) with a porous activated carbon (PAC) anode, it achieves an energy density of 54.22&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, a power density of 1599&#160;W kg&#8722;1, and 88% capacity retention over 20&#160;000 cycles. As a catalyst, the Ni&#8208;MJQD also exhibits high activity in benzyl alcohol oxidation, reaching 95% conversion and 98.4% selectivity for benzaldehyde, with the largest turnover frequency of 8.8825 &#215; 10&#8722;3 moles g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 using peroxymonosulfate (PMS) as an oxidant. Mechanistic analysis reveals contributions from both radical and nonradical pathways. These findings emphasize the unique potential of the Ni&#8208;MJQD electrodes for sustainable energy storage and green synthesis applications.

         <title>Microneedle Delivery of Small Extracellular Vesicles From Young Blood to Treat Endothelial Senescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microneedle patch loaded with extracellular vesicles derived from umbilical cord plasma (young plasma, Y&#8208;sEVs) is developed to treat endothelial senescence and aging&#8208;related vascular diseases. Among the microRNA cargos of Y&#8208;sEVs, miR&#8208;26a&#8208;5p suppresses the expression of Pak2 and NF&#8208;&#954;B, thereby reducing inflammatory cell infiltration across the endothelium and alleviating cellular senescence.








Abstract
Circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a crucial role in mediating communication between different cell populations and organs, significantly influencing inflammation and vascular diseases. To evaluate the role of EVs in regulating senescence, small EVs isolated from umbilical cord plasma (young sEVs, Y&#8208;sEVs) are compared with those from the plasma of elderly individuals (old sEVs, O&#8208;sEVs, &gt;70 years old) to identify key cargo components. To investigate their effects on senescence, Y&#8208;sEVs or O&#8208;sEVs are administered to aged mice using transdermal microneedle patches, enabling sustained EV release into the circulation. Doxorubicin is administered to induce enhanced endothelial senescence in aged mice (22&#8211;24 months old). Single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing revealed that Y&#8208;sEV treatment downregulated senescence&#8208;related genes in endothelial cells decreased the proportion of activated fibroblasts in the heart, and reduced disease&#8208;associated microglia in the brain. Delivery of Y&#8208;sEVs via microneedle patches preserved endothelial cell function, and mitigated inflammation and senescence, whereas O&#8208;sEVs exacerbated endothelial dysfunction.

To evaluate the role of EVs in regulating senescence, small EVs isolated from umbilical cord plasma (young sEVs, Y-sEVs) are compared with those from the plasma of elderly individuals (old sEVs, O-sEVs, &amp;gt;70 years old) to identify key cargo components. To investigate their effects on senescence, Y-sEVs or O-sEVs are administered to aged mice using transdermal microneedle patches, enabling sustained EV release into the circulation. Doxorubicin is administered to induce enhanced endothelial senescence in aged mice (22&#8211;24 months old). Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that Y-sEV treatment downregulated senescence-related genes in endothelial cells decreased the proportion of activated fibroblasts in the heart, and reduced disease-associated microglia in the brain. Delivery of Y-sEVs via microneedle patches preserved endothelial cell function, and mitigated inflammation and senescence, whereas O-sEVs exacerbated endothelial dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Harvesting Nanomaterials Based on Dyes for Energy Transfer and Amplified Biosensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light harvesting (LH) in plants inspires researchers to develop artificial LH nanomaterials. Here, LH nanomaterials based on organic dyes are reviewed, considering fundamental challenges on aggregation&#8208;caused quenching, excitation energy transfer, and exciton migration length. The efficient energy transfer from LH nanomaterial to an acceptor leads to signal amplification (antenna effect) important for sensing.








Abstract
Fascinating process of light harvesting (LH) in plants and bacteria leads to photosynthesis of oxygen and organic matter on the planet. It inspires researchers in the last decades to develop synthetic analogues &#8211; artificial LH nanomaterials. Here, LH nanomaterials based on dyes (organic chromophores) are reviewed. The fundamental aspects of LH include dye assembly into materials with minimal energy losses (i.e., high fluorescence quantum yield with minimized aggregation&#8208;caused quenching) and fast excitation energy transfer with large exciton migration length. The efficient energy transfer from LH nanomaterial to an acceptor leads to an amplification of acceptor emission &#8211; antenna effect, which constitutes the key performance parameter of LH nanoantenna. Individual classes of dye&#8208;based LH nanomaterials are analyzed: covalent molecular arrays of dyes (e.g., dendrimers and macrocycles), aggregates of &#8220;classical&#8221; dyes, aggregation&#8208;induced emission nanomaterials, metal&#8208;organic frameworks, ion&#8208;associated nanomaterials, and hybrid dye&#8208;based organic systems, such as dye&#8208;biomolecule hybrids, micelles and supramolecular polymers, dye&#8208;loaded silica and polymeric nanoparticles. The design principles and key performance characteristics of their selected (non&#8208;exhaustive) examples are analyzed. Due to their capacity to amplify the acceptor fluorescence signal, LH nanomaterials are particularly suitable for amplified sensing of small molecules, ions, biomolecules, which is particularly attractive for biomedical applications.

         <title>High Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells via Heteroatom&#8208;Containing Multifunctional Spiro Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel SAM is designed by introducing heteroatoms into a spiro structure, named Spiro&#8208;S, which achieves four functions: 1) the spiro structure suppresses molecular aggregation to ensure uniform substrate coverage; 2) the incorporated heteroatoms passivate buried interface defects; 3) enhancing perovskite crystallization; 4) suitable energy level. The resulting Spiro&#8208;S&#8208;based device demonstrates an exceptional PCE of 25.75% with improved stability.








Abstract
In inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the arrangement of self&#8208;assembled hole&#8208;transporting monolayers (SAMs) on substrates and their interaction with perovskite layer are critical for device efficiency and stability. Herein, two spiro SAMs are developed by introducing O and S atoms into the structure, named Spiro&#8208;O and Spiro&#8208;S, respectively. On one hand, the unique orthogonal molecular configuration of the spiro structure weakens intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, thereby inhibiting molecular aggregation. This ensures uniform coverage on the substrate and a homogeneous surface potential distribution. On the other hand, the lone pair electrons of the introduced heteroatoms can interact with the Pb2+ ions, enhancing the quality of the perovskite film and effectively passivating the defects at the perovskite/SAM interface. The experimental and theoretical results show that the S in Spiro&#8208;S strongly interacts with perovskite, resulting in the formation of a more uniform and higher&#8208;quality crystalline perovskite layer. Compared to PSCs based on Spiro&#8208;O, the device with Spiro&#8208;S shows decreased defects at the buried interface, ultimately achieving an impressive power conversion efficiency of 25.75% (certified 25.19%). Furthermore, the PSCs based on Spiro&#8208;S also exhibit better long stability; the unencapsulated champion devices retain 92% of the initial efficiency after being stored at 25&#160;&#176;C for 1200 h.

         <title>Constructing Continuously&#8208;Distributed and Crystalline&#8208;NaF&#8208;Rich SEI on Hard Carbon Anode Through Binder Chemistry for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative, continuously crystalline NaF&#8208;rich SEI is engineered on hard carbon anodes through cost&#8208;effective binder manipulation. The anion&#8208;coordination preferred LA133's functional groups synergistically promoting anion decomposition kinetics to form crystalline NaF, and homogenous LA133 coverage guides continuous NaF growth. The optimized hard carbon anodes deliver excellent storage performances regarding initial Columbic efficiency, rate capability, cycling stability, and wide temperature adaptability.








Abstract
Constructing the continuously&#8208;distributed and crystalline&#8208;NaF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (CC&#8208;NaF&#8208;SEI) is expected to greatly promote the sodium storage performance of hard carbon (HC) anodes. However, such an impressive concept remains extremely intractable to achieve and lacks an efficiently cost&#8208;less strategy. Herein, the application of the commercially available LA133 binder is pioneered to engineer such a CC&#8208;NaF&#8208;SEI. Through comparative analysis of representative binders with distinct functional groups, reveals the critical role of binder chemistry on SEI regulation. Specifically, the LA133 binder demonstrates a dual&#8208;regulation mechanism for CC&#8208;NaF&#8208;SEI formation. The anion&#8208;coordination preferred &#9472;CN bonds induce an anion&#8208;enriched interfacial solvation structure, and the &#9472;CONH/&#9472;CN groups catalytically cleave P&#9472;F bond dissociation in PF6&#8722;, synergistically promoting anion decomposition kinetics to form crystalline NaF. Furthermore, robust hydrogen bonds between multiple polar groups in LA133 and HC surface create the spatially anion&#8208;confined microenvironments to guide orderly anion decomposition and facilitate continuous NaF growth into a mechanically integrated SEI. The optimized CC&#8208;NaF&#8208;SEI endows HC anodes with exceptional sodium storage performance: an ultrahigh initial Coulombic efficiency (95.9%), remarkable reversible capacity (356.6 mAh g&#8722;1), and stable cycling under extreme conditions (&#8722;20&#8211;60&#160;&#176;C). This work provides fundamental insights into binder&#8208;SEI correlations, establishing a novel paradigm for interfacial optimization in sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>A 2D&#8208;3D Perovskite Memristor&#8208;Based Light&#8208;Induced Sensitized Neuron for Visual Information Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a 2D passivated 2D&#8208;3D OHPs memristor and explores its electronic and optical properties in detail. A neural spike circuit is designed to emulate light&#8208;induced sensitized neurons. Leveraging its frequency conversion excitation characteristics and wavelength selectivity, the visual image color filtering processing and the improved sensitized spiking neural network for computer image recognition are successfully achieved.








Abstract
Implementing Leaky Integrate&#8208;and&#8208;Fire (LIF) neurons in hardware is poised to enable the creation of efficient, low&#8208;power spiking neural networks (SNNs). This is attributed to the ability of LIF neurons to mimic the rapid response and sensitivity of biological neurons, thereby reducing unnecessary computational resources. The fixed firing frequency of conventional LIF neurons limits their adaptability to complex, dynamic environments. Existing variable&#8208;frequency LIF neurons often require additional circuitry, which increases system complexity. In this study, a 2D&#8208;3D organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OHPs) memristor is presented, incorporating 2D passivation of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) with phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI). The introduction of the 2D layer increases the migration energy barrier and restricts the diffusion of ions, thus enabling the modulation of the current decay and light responsivity. By leveraging the tunable decay and wavelength selectivity of the memristor, a light&#8208;induced sensitized neuron (LISN) with an enhanced firing frequency is developed using a fundamental circuit design. Furthermore, LISN, which exhibits improved temporal processing and long&#8208;term dependency management, are integrated into sensitized spiking neural networks (SSNNs) to demonstrate their superior classification capabilities. This study underscores the potential of LISN&#8208;based neuromorphic systems in visual information processing and offers new insights for applications in complex scenarios.

         <title>Ion Valency as a Molecular Switch for Salt&#8208;Resistant Underwater Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monovalent K+ ions weaken adhesion by forming K+&#8208;&#960; complexes with weak bridging capacity. In contrast, multivalent cations like Y3+ enhance adhesion by forming stable &#960;&#8208;cation&#8208;&#960; bridging networks, which are resistant to salt and capable of compensating for the loss of native &#960;&#8211;&#960; and NH3+&#8208;&#960; interactions. Through these contrasting effects, K+ and Y3+ function as molecular switches that regulate adhesion in cation&#8208;&#960;&#8208;based adhesive systems.








Abstract
Achieving underwater adhesion remains challenging due to the disruption of interfacial interactions by hydration layers and the ionic environment. This study shows how high adhesion in a saline environment can be achieved in adhesive peptide systems relying on &#960;&#8211;&#960; and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions using multivalent ions. Monovalent ions (K+) disrupt native peptide&#8208;peptide interactions, drastically reducing adhesion strength. Conversely, multivalent ions (Mg2+ and Y3+) enable robust interfacial adhesion by forming stable &#960;&#8208;cation&#8208;&#960; networks, effectively compensating for disrupted native pairings. The adhesion enhancement by Y3+ is particularly pronounced, highlighting its unique capability for multidentate bridging. Molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanical analyses confirm that Y3+ ions stabilize extended interfacial interactions, enabling stronger stress dissipation during tensile deformation. Additionally, NMR spectroscopy supports these observations by demonstrating significant cation&#8208;dependent perturbations of aromatic (Phe) and cationic (Lys) peptide residues. A thermodynamic model further elucidates the competitive binding dynamics underpinning adhesion modulation and capturing all experimental trends. This work provides detailed molecular insights into ion valency effects on cation&#8208;&#960; mediated underwater adhesion, guiding the development of bio&#8208;inspired materials with tailored ionic responsiveness suitable for biomedical and technological applications in saline environments.

         <title>Interface Reinforced Tailoring of Quantum Dots Regulates Reaction Trajectory of CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interface&#8208;reinforced regulation strategy is proposed to tailor the activation mode of CO2 in water. The facilitation of directional electron transfer and the interface&#8208;reinforced charge difference of the catalytic site at the CdSe/S/InS QD interface greatly promotes the shift of reaction trajectory of CO2 photoreduction, i.e., the main HCOO&#8722; product for CdSe is transformed into CO for CdSe/S/InS QDs.








Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis using semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) is one of the most promising pathways toward converting CO2 into valuable chemicals. However, the multistep process of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion endows the regulation of reaction trajectory from CO2 to specific products very challenging in aqueous solution. Here, it is first disclosed that the anisotropic growth of CdSe&#8722;S&#8722;InS interface in ultrafine heterojunction QDs alters the trajectory of CO2 photoreduction in water, i.e., CdSe/S/InS QDs mainly produce CO while CdSe QDs generate HCOO&#8722;. Under optimal conditions, the CO turnover number of CdSe/S/InS QDs is &#8776;1000 (12 h; vs QDs) with a selectivity of &gt;96% in C&#8208;based products or &#8776;57.6% when considering H2. The formation of anisotropic CdSe/S/InS ultrafine heterojunction facilitates charge migration at the interface, which is confirmed by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transient absorption spectroscopy. Further DFT simulations and in situ experiments demonstrate that the interfacial lattice expansion reinforces the charge difference at the interface, thus contributing to the product shift from HCOOH to CO, which clarifies the mechanism of interface&#8208;reinforced tailoring of CO2 reaction trajectories. This work can not only provide guidance for interfacial CO2 activation mode in water but also inspire the design of novel artificial photocatalysts with new functions.

         <title>Low&#8208;Energy, Ultrafast Spin Reorientation at Competing Hybrid Interfaces with Tunable Operating Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spin reorientation transition is generated at hybrid interfaces of Pt&#8208;Co&#8208;organic molecules in the vicinity of room temperature. This spin reorientation transition happens at an ultrafast scale and is controlled either through electrical current or fs laser pulse, introducing perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in formerly planar magnetised samples through heating.








Abstract
Information can be stored in magnetic materials by encoding with the direction of the magnetic moment. A figure of merit for these systems is the energy needed to rewrite&#160;the information by changing the magnetic moment. Organic molecules offer a playground to manipulate spin order, with metallo&#8208;molecular interfaces being a promising direction for sustainable devices. Here, a spin reorientation transition is demonstrated in molecular interfaces of 3d ferromagnetic films due to a competition between a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) induced by a heavy metal that dominates at high temperatures, and an in&#8208;plane anisotropy generated by molecular coupling at low temperatures. The transition can be tuned around room temperature by varying the ferromagnet thickness (1.4 &#8211; 1.9&#160;nm) or the choice of molecular overlayer, with the organic molecules being C60, hydrogen, and metal (Cu, Co) phthalocyanines. Near the transition temperature, the magnetisation easy axis can be switched with a small energy input, either electrically with a current density of 105&#8197;A&#8197;cm&#8722;2, or optically by a fs laser pulse of fluence as low as 0.12&#8197;mJ&#8197;cm&#8722;2, suggesting heat assisted technology applications. Magnetic dichroism measurements point toward a phase transition at the organic interface being responsible for the spin reorientation transition.

         <title>A Microalgae&#8208;Probiotic&#8208;Nanozyme Robot for Alleviating Intestinal Inflammation and Microbiota Dysbiosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An orally administered micro&#8208;nano robot is developed by encapsulating Lactobacillus plantarum armed with AuCe nanozyme onto Spirulina platensis (SP@LP@AuCe) to improve gut retention, deliver antioxidant protection, and regulate microbiota composition. The SP@LP@AuCe reduces pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines, enhances probiotic viability, and restores gut microbiota balance, demonstrating superior efficacy over conventional probiotic or nanozyme therapies.








Abstract
Inflammatory bowel disease is chronic gastrointestinal disorder characterized by persistent intestinal inflammation, which can lead to severe complications such as impaired intestinal barrier function and dysbiosis. Conventional therapies have challenges such as oxidative stress and insufficient intestinal colonization that hinder the treatment efficacy. Therapeutic strategies based on micro&#8208;nano robotic delivery are promising to address the limitations of current treatments by enabling precise targeting, enhancing bioavailability, and improving therapeutic outcomes. Herein, an orally administered micro&#8208;nano robot is developed utilizing Spirulina platensis as a carrier for nanozyme&#8208;armed probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum (SP@LP@AuCe) to enhance the efficacy of oral probiotics and nanomedicine in treating intestinal diseases. SP@LP@AuCe exhibits strong fluorescence imaging capability due to its chlorophyll&#8208;rich content, allowing for non&#8208;invasive and real&#8208;time monitoring following oral administration. The helical structure of Spirulina platensis facilitates entrapment in intestinal villi that enhances intestinal retention. Importantly, SP@LP@AuCe scavenges reactive oxygen species and modulates inflammatory responses, thereby alleviating intestinal inflammation, improving bacterial viability, and restoring the balance of intestinal microbiota. This strategy integrates microalgae, probiotics, and nanozymes within a micro&#8208;nano robotic framework, presenting a promising approach to enhancing drug bioavailability and exerting potent anti&#8208;inflammatory effects in the treatment of intestinal diseases.

         <title>Volumetric 3D Printing and Melt&#8208;Electrowriting to Fabricate Implantable Reinforced Cardiac Tissue Patches</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an implantable reinforced cardiac patch (RCPatch) combining volumetrically 3D&#8208;printed metamaterials with melt&#8208;electrowritten (MEW) meshes. The design integrates tunable stiff polymer structures&#160;with soft, cell&#8208;laden hydrogels. The RCPatch withstands suturing, intraventricular pressure, and cardiac contraction in a large animal myocardial defect model. The patch prevents bleeding and enables partial hemodynamic restabilization, demonstrating its potential for myocardial repair.








Abstract
Cardiac patches to repair myocardial defects require mechanically stable materials that prevent bleeding and can be implanted via suturing. The current clinical standard, bovine pericardial patches (BPPs), serve this purpose but do not degrade or integrate with the myocardium, limiting their long&#8208;term effectiveness. Here, we present the reinforced cardiac tissue patch (RCPatch). This multimaterial patch comprises a stiffness&#8208;tuned, cardiomyocyte&#8208;infiltrated 3D metamaterial and a suturable, hydrogel&#8208;infiltrated mesh to reduce permeability and bleeding. Anisotropic metamaterials are designed and computationally optimized using a generative modeling approach and fabricated from poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (PCL) via volumetric 3D printing (VP). The metamaterial supports the infiltration of cardiomyocytes, which are viable and contract in vitro. The implantability and low blood permeability of the patch is enabled&#160;by adding a melt&#8208;electrowritten (MEW) mesh infiltrated with a fibrin hydrogel. In an acute large animal trial, the RCPatch was applied on an induced myocardial defect, where it withstood intraventricular blood pressure, prevented bleeding, and enabled hemodynamic restabilization (intraventricular pressure of 81 mmHg before, vs 66 mmHg after implantation).

&lt;p&gt;This study presents an implantable reinforced cardiac patch (RCPatch) combining volumetrically 3D-printed metamaterials with melt-electrowritten (MEW) meshes. The design integrates tunable stiff polymer structures&#160;with soft, cell-laden hydrogels. The RCPatch withstands suturing, intraventricular pressure, and cardiac contraction in a large animal myocardial defect model. The patch prevents bleeding and enables partial hemodynamic restabilization, demonstrating its potential for myocardial repair.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cardiac patches to repair myocardial defects require mechanically stable materials that prevent bleeding and can be implanted via suturing. The current clinical standard, bovine pericardial patches (BPPs), serve this purpose but do not degrade or integrate with the myocardium, limiting their long-term effectiveness. Here, we present the reinforced cardiac tissue patch (RCPatch). This multimaterial patch comprises a stiffness-tuned, cardiomyocyte-infiltrated 3D metamaterial and a suturable, hydrogel-infiltrated mesh to reduce permeability and bleeding. Anisotropic metamaterials are designed and computationally optimized using a generative modeling approach and fabricated from poly(&#949;-caprolactone) (PCL) via volumetric 3D printing (VP). The metamaterial supports the infiltration of cardiomyocytes, which are viable and contract in vitro. The implantability and low blood permeability of the patch is enabled&#160;by adding a melt-electrowritten (MEW) mesh infiltrated with a fibrin hydrogel. In an acute large animal trial, the RCPatch was applied on an induced myocardial defect, where it withstood intraventricular blood pressure, prevented bleeding, and enabled hemodynamic restabilization (intraventricular pressure of 81 mmHg before, vs 66 mmHg after implantation). These findings establish a scalable framework for fabricating cardiac tissue patches that integrate mechanical reinforcement with biological function, offering a surgically implantable&#160;and future regenerative solution for intraventricular myocardial repair.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>AI&#8208;Powered Experimental Discovery of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for n/i&#8208;Butane Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adsorption isotherms serve as descriptors which is accessible via both experiments and simulations. A training set optimization strategy based on descriptor similarity significantly reduces the training costs of AI model. The combination of AI, simulation and experiment accelerates the discovery of the high&#8208;performance MOF for separating n/i&#8208;butane.








Abstract
There are significant challenges in developing efficient adsorbents as alternatives to the energy&#8208;intensive distillation processes for n/i&#8208;butane separation. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) hold great potential in addressing this issue. However, the vast diversity of MOFs makes the discovery of high&#8208;performance materials akin to searching for a needle in a haystack. Here, the high&#8208;throughput screening based on artificial intelligence (AI)&#160;is employed to accelerate the identification of MOFs for n/i&#8208;butane separation. An integrated descriptor system, accessible via both experiments and simulations, is proposed and broadly validated, demonstrating better performance over those widely&#8208;used descriptors. In addition, an optimization strategy for training dataset is proposed based on similarity, allowing for the efficient model training with only 10% samples from the entire database and thus significantly reducing the costs. Leveraging the integrated descriptors and optimization strategy, MOFs with exceptional n/i&#8208;butane separation performance are successfully identified through neural network model. As a proof of concept, SIFSIX&#8208;3&#8208;Zn is synthesized for validation because it has the largest n&#8208;butane capacity among top 20 MOFs. The SIFSIX&#8208;3&#8208;Zn demonstrates outstanding n/i&#8208;butane separation performance with nearly zero uptake of i&#8208;butane. This work introduces a novel research paradigm integrating AI, simulation and experiment, and presents an efficient process with broad applicability for material discovery.

         <title>Dimensionality Effect of Nanocarbon Precursors on Diamond Synthesis under Extreme Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dimensionality effect of nanocarbon precursors on diamond synthesis and transformation mechanism is investigated using laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell, including 0D carbon nanocage and fullerene, 1D nanotube and 3D graphite. The critical temperature and pressure of nanocarbon precursors becomes more stringent as their dimensionalities rise up. This work can shed light on the controllable preparation of diamond and related materials.








Abstract
Diamond holds significant promise for a wide range of applications due to its exceptional physicochemical properties. Investigating the controlled diamond preparation from nanocarbon precursors with varying dimensionalities is crucial to optimize the transition conditions and even elucidate the daunting transformation mechanism, however, this remains outstanding challenge despite considerable effort. Herein, the imperative dimensionality effect of nanocarbon precursors on diamond synthesis and the physical mechanism under high temperature and high pressure is reported, by comparing the distinct transition processes of 0D carbon nanocages (CNCs) and 1D carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from conventional graphite. The optical and structural characterizations evidently demonstrate that both 0D CNCs and 1D CNTs first undergo collapse and graphitization, followed by the formation of mixed amorphous carbon with embedded diamond clusters, eventually leading to cubic diamond. The plotted pressure&#8208;temperature diagram exhibits the unique dimensionality effect of carbon nanomaterials to diamond transformation. These results provide valuable insights into the phase transition mechanisms of diamond synthesis and its derivatives under extreme conditions.

         <title>Unlocking Grotthuss Proton Energy Storage in Pyrochlore&#8208;Type Tungsten Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel trace&#8208;Ni2+&#8208;implanted pyrochlore&#8208;type tungsten oxide is developed to showcase unique Grotthuss proton conduction abilities based on hydrogen&#8208;bonding topochemistry, which has realized ultrafast and stable electrochemical proton storage performance in aqueous proton batteries up to 500C.








Abstract
It is of momentous significance to identify suitable proton&#8208;storage electrode materials inherent with Grotthuss topochemistry toward high&#8208;power aqueous proton batteries. However, currently reported oxide electrode materials have seldom conformed to the Grotthuss mechanism. Here Grotthuss mechanism&#8208;dominated proton storage is showcased in a novel 3D&#8208;tunnel&#8208;structured pyrochlore&#8208;type WO3&#183;0.5H2O (WOH), together with a reliable and effective approach to amplifying its Grotthuss conduction effect. Different from other phases of tungsten oxide (e.g., orthorhombic, monoclinic, and hexagonal), the zeolitic&#8208;water&#8208;enriched cubic pyrochlore WOH favors proton&#8208;hopping akin to &#8220;Newton's cradle&#8221; instead of traditional &#8220;vehicle&#8208;like&#8221; transport. Interestingly, introducing trace Ni(II) ions into the WOH (NWOH) is find to notably increase the content of structural water in lattice, thereby reframing the hydrogen&#8208;bonding network along with enhanced proton transfer capability as a consequence of its largely reduced activation energy as low as 0.08 eV. Hence, NWOH shows boosted reversible capacity of 71 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100C, ultrafast charging capability up to 500C, and ultralong cycling life over 30,000 cycles. Once coupled with Prussian blue analogue cathodes with identical Grotthuss conduction mechanism, the resultant high&#8208;output&#8208;voltage full&#8208;cells (&#8776;1.1 V) sustain high&#8208;rate cycling with high energy/power density and operate at a wide working temperature from &#8722;20 to 50&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Sacrificial&#8208;Agent&#8208;Triggered Mass Transfer Gating in Covalent Organic Framework for Hydrogen Peroxide Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sacrificial&#8208;agent&#8208;triggered mass transfer gating (MTG) strategy reconfigures interfacial reactions for photocatalytic H2O2 generation in COFs. This enables precise switching of the dominant photocatalytic mechanism between surface&#8208;confined directional charge transfer pathways and diffusion&#8208;dominated redox processes. Mechanistic studies elucidate the ternary role of sacrificial agents as MTG regulators, effectively addressing inherent reaction constraints.








Abstract
Covalent organic framework (COF) photocatalysts for H2O2 production remain challenging by mass transport limitations and poor charge separation efficiency. Herein, a sacrificial agent&#8208;triggered mass&#8208;transfer gating (MTG) strategy is developed to reconfigure interfacial reaction for photocatalytic H2O2 generation via synthesized benzothiazole&#8208;COFs. This enables precise switching of the dominant photocatalytic mechanism between surface&#8208;confined directional charge transfer pathways and diffusion&#8208;dominated redox processes. Notably, benzyl alcohol (BA) enhances the mass transport and the catalytic site accessibility, scavenges photogenerated holes, and supplies protons for coupling reactions, thereby increasing the H2O2 yield of Tp&#8208;BTz COF to 100.9 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and achieving the outstanding photocatalytic performance reported to date. Both Tp&#8208;BTz COF and Tp&#8208;TTz COF demonstrate durably high H2O2 production efficiency even in the high&#8208;salinity seawater and municipal tap water systems. The generated H2O2 effectively degrades organic pollutants such as methyl orange (MO) and rhodamine B (RhB), demonstrating practical potential for wastewater treatment. The proposed gating strategy by introducing BA enables three synergistic functions: i) modulating interfacial reactions, ii) acting as a sacrificial agent to scavenge holes, and iii) supplying abundant protons (H+) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to facilitate the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer. This approach establishes a generalizable paradigm for designing high&#8208;performance photocatalytic systems toward sustainable energy and environmental applications.

         <title>Electric Field&#8208;Guided Ion Orchestration for Multi&#8208;Chemistry Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electric field&#8208;guided ion orchestration (EF&#8208;IO) strategy is developed to stabilize zinc metal batteries. By leveraging cation interfacial modifiers to reconfigure electric double layers and solvation configurations, the EF&#8208;IO design enables ultra&#8208;long cyclability and wide temperature adaptability. It also unlocks new reversible anion storage in high&#8208;voltage organic cathodes, advancing multi&#8208;chemistry zinc battery designs.








Abstract
While nonaqueous cosolvents alleviate hydrogen evolution reaction and dendritic growth in aqueous zinc (Zn) metal batteries (ZMBs), persistent H2O activity at Zn|electrolyte interfaces originating from unregulated ion distribution leads to premature failure. Here, an electric field&#8208;guided ion orchestration (EF&#8208;IO) strategy is proposed, leveraging cation interfacial modifiers to reconfigure electric double layers (EDLs) and solvation configurations. Interfacial simulations combined with experimental investigations verify that the ion&#8208;orchestrated&#8208;EDL synergistically diversifies Zn2+/Na+ solvation configurations and homogenizes localized electric fields, thereby forming an organic&#8211;inorganic gradient solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) that suppresses parasitic reactions. This enables dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating with 3400&#160;h cyclability in Zn||Zn symmetric cells, while Zn||V10O24&#183;12H2O full cells exhibit exceptional durability along with wide temperature adaptability (&#8722;45 to 55&#160;&#176;C). Crucially, this EF&#8208;IO strategy unlocks ClO4&#8722;&#8208;based reversible anion storage in high&#8208;voltage organic cathodes. By bridging interfacial dynamics and multi&#8208;chemistry compatibility, this work establishes a promising paradigm for robust and versatile ZMBs.

         <title>Nonreciprocal Spin Waves in Nanoscale Hybrid N&#233;el&#8211;Bloch&#8211;N&#233;el Domain Walls Detected by Scanning X&#8208;Ray Microscopy in Perpendicular Magnetic Anisotropic Fe/Gd Multilayers</title>

         <dc:description>
Using scanning transmission X&#8208;ray microscopy, nonreciprocal spin&#8208;wave behavior is revealed in real space in Fe/Gd multilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, highlighting their functionality for magnonic logic circuits operating at GHz frequencies. Topological defects disrupt phase continuity while preserving nonreciprocity, demonstrating the potential of these domain walls as programmable magnonic waveguides for directed information flow.








Abstract
Spin wave nonreciprocity is crucial for signal processing in magnonic circuits. Domain walls (DWs) have been suggested as channels for nonreciprocal spin waves (magnons) with directional&#8208;dependent properties. However, the experimental investigations are challenging due to the low&#8208;damping magnetic material with DWs demanded and the nanoscale length scales involved. In this study, scanning transmission X&#8208;ray microscopy (STXM) is used to examine coherently&#8208;excited magnons when propagating in hybrid N&#233;el&#8208;Bloch&#8208;N&#233;el DWs in amorphous Fe/Gd multilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). Well&#8208;ordered lattices of stripe domains and DWs are created through the integration of Cobalt nanowire arrays. Their width is measured to be &#948;DW = (60 &#177; 13) nm. Near 1 GHz magnons are detected with short wavelengths down to &#955; = (281 &#177; 44)&#160;nm which were&#160;channeled in the DWs. Consistent with micromagnetic simulations, the STXM data revealed a nonreciprocal magnon band structure inside the DWs. Bloch points are identified which disrupted the phase evolution of magnons and induced different &#955; adjacent to these topological defects. These observations provide direct evidence of nonreciprocal spin waves within hybrid N&#233;el&#8211;Bloch&#8211;N&#233;el DWs in PMA materials, serving as programmable waveguides in magnonic devices with directed information&#160;flow.

         <title>Selective Crystallization Delay in Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskites Enables Initial Homogeneous Phase for Square Centimeter Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mixed&#8208;halide perovskite film with initially homogeneous phase distribution is obtained by using 3&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;fluorobenzamide additive, which selectively suppresses bromide precipitation during crystallization to mitigate halide phase segregation while demonstrating weak size dependence. The resulting 1.004&#8208;cm2 perovskite/organic tandem solar cells achieved a remarkable 25.21% power conversion efficiency, coupled with impressive operational stability maintaining &#8776;90% initial performance over 1500 h.








Abstract
Mixed halide wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskites, used in high&#8208;performance perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (TSCs), are prone to phase segregation under light irradiation. Particularly, the initial inhomogeneous halide phase distribution in WBG perovskites can accelerate the phase segregation under operational stressors, thus hindering scaling of TSCs that require high phase homogeneity. Here, a selective delayed crystallization strategy is proposed in which a functional agent (3&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;fluorobenzamide; AFBA) is used to regulate the initial halide phase distribution. The &#8208;NH2 of AFBA, with a low electron&#8208;cloud density, shows a higher binding affinity with bromide than with iodide, thus selectively delaying the rapid crystallization of bromide; this phenomenon induces a homogeneous halide distribution across the film. The initial homogeneous film is phase&#8208;stable under operational stressors. As a result, the square&#8208;centimeter WBG perovskite front cell achieves a high efficiency of 18.61%. When stacked with organic subcells, the square&#8208;centimeter perovskite/organic TSC exhibits a remarkable efficiency of 25.21%, showing a weak&#8208;dependence of efficiency on size from 0.062 to 2.000 cm2, as well as a prolonged operational lifetime with a T90 of 1500&#160;h. Perovskite/organic TSCs are also connected in series with electrochromic devices to dynamically monitor the TSC performance via the color variation, providing insights for their future applications.

         <title>Gate&#8208;Tunable Highly Linear Bipolar Photoresponse in Se@SWCNT Adaptive Neurons for Dynamically Programmable Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a dynamically programmable synaptic transistor with a Se@SWCNT 1D van der Waals heterojunction, enabling both positive and negative responses via gate&#8208;tunable modulation. The transistor achieves high symmetry and linearity (R2&#160;&gt;&#160;0.99) in weight variation, demonstrating excellent performance across complex tasks, offering promising applications in brain&#8208;inspired optical neuromorphic systems with high accuracy.








Abstract
The development of tunable and highly controllable photoconductive devices for brain&#8208;inspired optical neuromorphic systems remains challenging. Previous neuromorphic devices are limited by asymmetric and nonlinear conductive properties, which impose specific restrictions on training tasks and weight learning rules in dynamic and complex visual environments. A programmable synaptic transistor based on a Se@SWCNT 1D van der Waals heterojunction, enabling gate&#8208;controlled positive and negative responses is presented. This approach eliminates the need for multilayer heterojunctions or complex circuits, simplifying array integration and wafer&#8208;scale fabrication. This phototransistor shows improved symmetry and linearity (R2&#160;&gt;&#160;0.99) in weight variation following optical stimulation, and simultaneously achieves linear persistent photoconductivity and negative photoconductivity with over 128 memory states, which is not reported previously. By adjusting light intensity and wavelength range, consistent weight rule processing across three tasks of increasing complexity is demonstrated. Notably, different visual tasks require distinct neural structures and decay rates. The proposed transistor facilitates transitions between bio&#8208;inspired brain regions via optical hybrid programming, adapting to dynamic visual environments. This innovation contributes significantly to brain&#8208;like computing and bio&#8208;inspired vision, due to its exceptional accuracy and dynamic switch models.

         <title>Microstructural Evolution Dynamics in Rapid Joule Heating Densification of High&#8208;Nickel Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introduction of high&#8208;temperature rapid Joule heating combined with two&#8208;step sintering drives full densification while suppressing grain coarsening in high&#8208;Ni cathodes. By activating lattice and grain boundary diffusion over surface diffusion, this approach achieves dense microstructures without excessive grain growth, offering insights into the relationship between sintering dynamics and microstructural evolution, and guiding the synthesis of fully densified, high&#8208;energy density materials.








Abstract
High&#8208;energy density materials are essential for the advancement of next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries, which power a wide range of applications from portable electronics to electric vehicles. Among them, high&#8208;Nickel (Ni)&#160;layered oxide cathodes have emerged as promising candidates due to their high capacity and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, pores and excessive grain growth in high&#8208;Ni layered oxides compromise energy density and mechanical integrity, while oversized grains hinder lithium&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics, necessitating a sintering strategy that promotes densification without inducing abnormal grain growth. Here, a rapid Joule heating technique combined with two&#8208;step sintering is introduced that significantly improves the microstructural integrity of high&#8208;Ni cathodes. This approach enables fast densification while suppressing grain growth, resulting in cathodes with higher density, reduced porosity, and enhanced mechanical strength. Through in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), small angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS), and 3D ptychography analysis, it is found that the rapid Joule&#8208;heated cathodes exhibit mitigated phase separation, suppressed pore evolution, and improved resistance to crack propagation. They deliver superior cycling stability, coulombic efficiency, and rate performance. These results provide insights into the relationship between sintering dynamics and microstructural evolution, offering guidelines for synthesizing fully densified, high&#8208;energy density materials.

         <title>Stacking III&#8208;Nitride Ultraviolet&#8208;B Light Emitters with High Efficiency via a Lattice&#8208;Engineered Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lattice&#8208;engineered architecture through in situ surface pretreatment is proposed, by which dense and discrete nanocrystalline graphite (NC graphite) masks, owing to the decomposition of metal organics, are introduced to bring about controllable epitaxial lateral overgrowth. Stress in AlN is then continuously modulated from a compressive state to a high tensile one of 2.51 GPa with a strain of 0.51%.








Abstract
AlGaN&#8208;based ultraviolet (UV) light emitters in the range of 280&#8211;320&#160;nm (UVB band) show irreplaceable prospects in the field of medical care, but suffer from a low&#8208;efficiency issue known as the &#8220;UVB gap.&#8221; This issue stems from the large lattice mismatch between low&#8208;Al&#8208;content AlGaN and AlN, which causes the AlGaN epilayer to endure a significant compressive stress during structural stacking, resulting in dislocation multiplication and surface roughening, and thus seriously deteriorating the device performance. Herein, a lattice&#8208;engineered architecture through surface pretreatment is proposed, by which dense and discrete nanocrystalline graphite masks, formed by the decomposition of metal organics, are introduced to bring about controllable epitaxial lateral overgrowth and consequent stress. The stress in AlN is then continuously modulated from a compressive to a tensile state of 2.51&#160;GPa with a strain of 0.51%, making its in&#8208;plane lattice constant equivalent to that of freestanding Al0.79Ga0.21N. As such, high&#8208;quality full&#8208;Al&#8208;content AlGaN epitaxy, in particular with an Al content below 50%, is realized, which brings about a significant performance improvement in 310&#8208;nm UVB LEDs, with a maximum wall&#8208;plug efficiency achieving 4.88%. This study makes a major breakthrough in the stacking of AlGaN&#8208;based UVB light emitters and definitely speeds up their further applications.

         <title>Push&#8211;Pull Electronic Effect and D&#8208;Band Center Bi&#8208;Modulated Bio&#8208;Heterojunction Enzyme Enables All&#8208;Stage Infected Wound Healing</title>

         <dc:description>
Push&#8208;pull electronic effect and d&#8208;band center bi&#8208;modulated bio&#8208;heterojunction enzyme is proposed, which is consisted of FeMoS4 and MXene. Under NIR irradiation, the heterostructure facilitates electron&#8208;hole separation with localized electron accumulation at FeMoS4 sites. The electronic push&#8208;pull effect induced by Mo polarizes oxygen&#8208;containing reactants toward Fe active centers, enabling sequential electron capture for ROS generation. It provides an efficient approach in infected wound healing.








Abstract
Pathogenic infections pose a persistent threat to global public health, necessitating innovative antibacterial strategies with well&#8208;defined disinfection pathway. The antibacterial efficiency is confined in the contradiction between reactants adsorption and intermediates desorption. Here, the FeMoS4/MXene bio&#8208;heterojunction enzyme (FM BioHJzyme) is proposed and constructed. Under the inspiration of near&#8208;infrared light (NIR), the heterostructures between the FeMoS4 and MXene facilitates efficient electron&#8208;hole separation with localized electron accumulation at FeMoS4 sites. Crucially, the electronic push&#8208;pull effect induced by Mo polarizes oxygen&#8208;containing reactants (H2O2, H2O, O2) toward Fe active centers, enabling sequential electron capture for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. The results also reveal an enhancement in electron density at Fe sites compared to FeS/MXene controls, which is accompanied by a downshift in the Fe d&#8208;band center that reduces intermediates adsorption energy. The therapeutic efficacy is systematically evaluated using an S. aureus&#8208;infected full&#8208;thickness skin defect model. The bi&#8208;modulated FM BioHJzyme exhibits favorable antibacterial efficiency under NIR irradiation, while subsequent wound healing is facilitated through collagen deposition and angiogenesis in the following absence of NIR irradiation. This work offers a deep insight into the intricate mechanism&#8208;performance relationship of BioHJzyme platform in catalytic anti&#8208;bacterial application and proposes a sustainable approach of mechanism&#8208;guided materials design.

         <title>Crystallization Modulation Through Electron Transport Layer Surface Reconstruction Enables High&#8208;Performance Full&#8208;Air&#8208;Processed Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homogenization strategy for SnO2 ETL based on surface reconstruction is developed by introducing natural molecule L&#8208;carnosine (LC) at the buried interface. LC not only achieves more homogeneous photon and electron transport, but also manipulates crystallization dynamics. The optimized device achieves a remarkable PCE of 25.30%, which is among the highest values reported for air&#8208;processed n&#8208;i&#8208;p structured PSCs.








Abstract
The quality of the buried interface critically determines the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a homogenization strategy for the tin oxide (SnO2) electron transport layer (ETL) based on surface reconstruction is developed to enable mesoscale interface manipulation. By introducing the natural L&#8208;carnosine (LC) at the buried interface, we achieve homogenized photon and electron transport through surface optimization of the SnO2 ETL. Additionally, the multi&#8208;active sites in LC establish interlayer bridging and optimize interfacial contact, simultaneously passivating interfacial defects, mitigating residual stress, and improving carrier dynamics. Furthermore, LC modification regulates perovskite crystallization kinetics through multiple bonding mechanisms, facilitating the growth of high&#8208;quality perovskite films. Ultimately, the champion device fabricated entirely in air achieves a power conversion efficiency of 25.30%, one of the highest efficiencies reported for air&#8208;processed n&#8208;i&#8208;p structured PSCs. The optimized device without encapsulation exhibits enhanced stability under ISOS protocols, retaining 91.03% of its initial efficiency after 3192 h at 30 &#177; 5% relative humidity, 90.71% after 1512 h of thermal aging at 65&#160;&#176;C, and 90.17% after 1000 h of continuous maximum power point tracking under one&#8208;sun illumination.

         <title>Near&#8208;Quantitative Photothermal Conversion in Non&#8208;Fluorescent Diradicaloid Organic Molecules for Efficient Solar Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a strategy to achieve near&#8208;quantitative photothermal conversion efficiency of 94.3% in organic molecules by incorporating electron&#8208;donating substituents in non&#8208;fluorescent diradicaloid. These molecules exhibit broadband absorption across 300&#8211;2000&#160;nm, and can be elevated to 103&#160;&#176;C under one sun irradiation when loaded into polyurethane, enabling a high solar water evaporation efficiency of 98.52%.








Abstract
Organic small molecules have emerged as promising photothermal materials for solar energy harvesting due to their structural tunability and diverse optoelectronic properties. However, achieving photothermal conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 90% in such systems remains a significant challenge, largely limited by residual fluorescence and suboptimal non&#8208;radiative decay pathways. Here, a molecular design strategy is reported that combines inherently non&#8208;fluorescent diradicaloid cores with electron&#8208;donating substituents to facilitate non&#8208;radiative decay and enhance PCE. It is demonstrated that the PCE can be effectively tuned from 64.9% (nitro&#8208;substituted) to a near&#8208;quantitative 94.3% (dimethylamine&#8208;substituted). Moreover, the equilibrium temperature of dimethylamine functionalized diradicaloid can be elevated to record breaking 350&#160;&#176;C in organic materials under 1&#160;W cm&#8722;2 808&#160;nm laser, and lifted to 103&#160;&#176;C under one sun irradiation when loaded into polyurethane. This exceptional performance is attributed to a small energy gap, strong donor&#8211;acceptor interaction, and active molecular motion that together promote efficient vibronic relaxation and internal conversion. Furthermore, these molecules exhibit broadband absorption across 300&#8211;2000&#160;nm, enabling a high water evaporation efficiency of 98.52% under one sun and facilitating high&#8208;voltage output in solar thermoelectric generators. This work presents a robust design strategy for high&#8208;efficiency organic photothermal materials, offering new opportunities for solar&#8208;driven thermal energy harvesting and conversion technologies.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic small molecules have emerged as promising photothermal materials for solar energy harvesting due to their structural tunability and diverse optoelectronic properties. However, achieving photothermal conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 90% in such systems remains a significant challenge, largely limited by residual fluorescence and suboptimal non-radiative decay pathways. Here, a molecular design strategy is reported that combines inherently non-fluorescent diradicaloid cores with electron-donating substituents to facilitate non-radiative decay and enhance PCE. It is demonstrated that the PCE can be effectively tuned from 64.9% (nitro-substituted) to a near-quantitative 94.3% (dimethylamine-substituted). Moreover, the equilibrium temperature of dimethylamine functionalized diradicaloid can be elevated to record breaking 350&#160;&#176;C in organic materials under 1&#160;W cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; 808&#160;nm laser, and lifted to 103&#160;&#176;C under one sun irradiation when loaded into polyurethane. This exceptional performance is attributed to a small energy gap, strong donor&#8211;acceptor interaction, and active molecular motion that together promote efficient vibronic relaxation and internal conversion. Furthermore, these molecules exhibit broadband absorption across 300&#8211;2000&#160;nm, enabling a high water evaporation efficiency of 98.52% under one sun and facilitating high-voltage output in solar thermoelectric generators. This work presents a robust design strategy for high-efficiency organic photothermal materials, offering new opportunities for solar-driven thermal energy harvesting and conversion technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Proteolysis&#8208;triggered RNA Interference for Mitochondrial Iron Dyshomeostasis to Activate Antitumor Immunity in Hepatic Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;triggering proteolysis RNA interference system (namely cRGD&#8208;VFs) is elaborately designed. Specifically, cRGD&#8208;VFs release abundant Fe2+ by self &#8208;triggering proteolysis of the ferritin shell and ENO1&#8208;targeted siRNA for the regulation of ENO1&#8208;IRP1&#8208;Mfrn1 pathway, which synergistically induce severe mitochondrial iron dyshomeostasis, resulting in immunogenic tumor cell death and activating strong antitumor immunity to eliminate hepatic carcinoma.








Abstract
Although the disturbance of iron metabolism holds significant promise for antitumor therapy, the specific regulation of the precise acting site remains challenging. Here, a self&#8208;triggering proteolysis RNA interference system (cRGD&#8208;VFs) is elaborately constructed to precisely disturb mitochondrial iron homeostasis, the core hub of cellular iron regulation, for evoking antitumor immunity. Specifically, ferritin is conjugated with E3 ligase ligand VH032 and tumor&#8208;targeting cRGD peptide through click chemistry, and further loaded with ENO1&#8208;targeted siRNA to prepare cRGD&#8208;VFs. Following the targeted uptake by tumor cells, cRGD&#8208;VFs recruits E3 ligase to initiate the ubiquitination process to trigger the proteolysis of ferritin, resulting in the release of abundant Fe2+ and the loaded siRNA. siRNA&#8208;mediated ENO1&#8208;targeted knockdown would upregulate the mitochondrial iron transport channel through the ENO1&#8208;IRP1&#8208;Mfrn1 pathway, which subsequently leads to mitochondrial iron overload and the increase of detrimental mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby triggering severe mitochondria destruction and causing mass death of tumor cells. Noteworthily, it is found that cRGD&#8208;VFs&#8208;mediated mitochondrial iron overload can activate powerful antitumor immunity by upregulating immune&#8208;related pathways to eliminate tumors, achieving notable tumor suppression in multiple murine liver cancer models, which represents a promising strategy of disturbing mitochondrial iron homeostasis for potentiating antitumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Defect Engineering toward High&#8208;Performance Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review aims to offer an in&#8208;depth comprehension of defect properties in Sn&#8208;based perovskites and to summarize the latest advancements in passivation strategies toward high&#8208;performance of Sn&#8208;based perovskite field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs), which provides critical insight into the relationships between defect properties and FET device performance in Sn&#8208;based perovskites.








Abstract
Tin (Sn)&#8208;based perovskite field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) have garnered considerable attention as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation electronics and optoelectronics due to their exceptional charge transport properties, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and eco&#8208;friendly nature. However, owing to facile Sn vacancy formation, serious oxidation as well as uncontrollable crystallization, Sn&#8208;based perovskites generally suffer from inferior film quality with high&#8208;density defects, resulting in unfavorable self&#8208;doping effects with high hole concentrations. Furthermore, defects within the relatively thin films (tens of nanometers) of these FETs, primarily located at the surface and grain boundaries (GBs) of perovskite films, significantly impact the charge transport, ion migration, and structural stability during device operation, thereby impeding the achievement of high&#8208;performance Sn&#8208;based perovskite FETs. Herein, a comprehensive overview of defect properties, origins, and their influence on the performance of Sn&#8208;based perovskite FETs is present. In particular, the advanced defect passivation strategies, including compositional engineering, dopant modification, dimensional engineering, interface passivation, and crystallization regulation are summarized systematically. Lastly, the existing challenges and potential future prospects regarding defect engineering are proposed to achieve high&#8208;performance Sn&#8208;based perovskite FETs, which will pave the way for further large&#8208;scale integration applications.

         <title>Decoupling the Exciton&#8208;Carrier Interaction for Highly Efficient Pure Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Exceeding 20%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel De&#8208;EML, which can decouple the interaction between excitons and charge carriers and anchor the recombination zone to the center of the EML, is fabricated, perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) based on the De&#8208;EML exhibit the pure blue emission at 469nm and record an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 20.3%, a record lifetime of 184.7 h.








Abstract
Pure blue emission (wavelength &#8804; 470&#160;nm) is essential for perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) in the application of future displays. However, the performance of the pure blue PeLEDs is far away from the application requirement and theoretical values. The charging of excitons plays a crucial role in the non&#8208;radiative decay of the high&#8208;energy blue perovskite emitters under electric fields. Here, a designed exciton&#8208;carrier decoupling emitting layer (De&#8208;EML) is reported which can simultaneously suppress the formation of charged excitons and facilitate the injection of carriers. By tuning the energy levels of each QD layer in the De&#8208;EML, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) reached 83.7%, and the Auger recombination related to exciton&#8208;carrier coupling in high excitation intensities is suppressed. Based on the designed De&#8208;EML, high&#8208;performance pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs (emission at 469&#160;nm) with an EQE of 20.3% and an operational lifetime (T80) of 4.8 h at 1070&#160;cd m&#8722;2 is demonstrated. A record maximum brightness of 31&#8201;407&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 is also achieved.

         <title>Dynamic Dissolution&#8208;Deposition Equilibrium Enables Unprecedented HER Stability in Acidic PEMWE</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen energy is key to achieving carbon neutrality. Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) enables efficient green hydrogen production but faces catalyst instability issues. This work introduces a low&#8208;platinum catalyst with a dynamic equilibrium mechanism, balancing durability and activity. The catalyst achieves industrial&#8208;grade stability (&gt;2&#160;200&#160;h) and high performance, offering a scalable solution for cost&#8208;effective, durable electrolyzers and advancing renewable energy storage.








Abstract
Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) holds substantial promise for effectively utilizing renewable energy to produce green hydrogen. However, it faces critical durability challenges due to acid&#8208;driven catalyst degradation under intermittent renewable power. Here, this study reports a dynamic dissolution&#8208;deposition equilibrium that achieves exceptional hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) stability through rational design of a high&#8208;entropy alloy&#8208;derived architecture. Dealloying FeCoNiNbPt HEA creates a porous scaffold with dual&#8208;functional components: an amorphous NbOx buffer suppressing metal dissolution, while multicomponent Pt3(FeCoNi) nanocrystals synergistically enhancing HER activity (137 mV@1 A cm&#8722;2, 2.5 &#215; lower than Pt/C) that thermodynamically favors redeposition. This dynamic self&#8208;adaptive mechanism maintains equilibrium under harsh operating conditions, demonstrating exceptional durability (&gt;2200&#160;h @1 A cm&#8722;2 and 1&#160;000&#160;000 cycles). The self&#8208;supported catalysts can be easily mass&#8208;produced with 8.87&#160;wt.% Pt loading (60% reduction vs Pt/C), indicating its industrial applicability. The equilibrium&#8208;driven design paradigm opens new avenues for industrial proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane devices operating under fluctuating power.

         <title>High&#8208;Precision 3D Doping of Fused Silica Glass Derived from Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The local integration of dopants enables the selective modification of color, luminescence or refractive index within a three&#8208;dimensionally shaped glass with micron resolution. Following the fabrication of porous glass preforms and infusion with a dopant mixture, the dopant is immobilized by lithographic techniques and subsequently debinded and sintered. This enables to integrate functions in complex&#8208;shaped glass components.








Abstract
Glasses are utilized for their outstanding optical, mechanical, and thermal properties. However, conventional production methods mostly yield in glasses with uniform compositions and material properties. Here a novel lithographic approach is presented for high&#8208;resolution 3D dopant integration at defined positions, which enables property modifications in specific regions. For this, a porous glass matrix derived from nanocomposites is shaped using 3D printing or injection molding. Using volumetric 3D printing like computed axial or two&#8208;photon lithography, doping is performed within the porous glass using photocurable metal oxide precursors. The dopant is then permanently integrated within the glass during a final sintering step. The local integration of dopants like Ti4+, Co2+, Eu3+ or Tb3+ allow to selectively change the color, luminescence or refractive index within a 3D&#8208;shaped glass with micron resolution. The process enables a wide range of novel applications from integrated optics and photonics to mass customization, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and information storage.

         <title>Fully Reshapeable and Recyclable Protein Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By taking advantage of the substantial stiffness contrast between protein hydrogels in their folded and unfolded protein states as well as reversible disulfide crosslinking, a robust and general strategy is reported to engineer fully reshapeable and recyclable protein hydrogels. These protein hydrogels can be reversibly reshaped across one&#8208;, two&#8208;, and three&#8208;dimensional geometries, and be fully recycled for material circularity.








Abstract
Hydrogels have emerged as a new generation of functional materials with a broad range of applications in diverse fields. They usually cannot be reshaped or recycled, restricting their ability to respond to evolving demands and emerging applications, and contributing to the accumulation of synthetic polymer waste and associated environmental concerns. Here, a robust and general strategy is reported to engineer fully reshapeable and recyclable protein hydrogels by integrating protein folding&#8208;unfolding with reversible disulfide crosslinking. Taking advantage of the substantial stiffness contrast between protein hydrogels in their folded and unfolded protein states, protein hydrogels are reversibly reshaped across one&#8208;, two&#8208;, and three&#8208;dimensional geometries. Due to the denaturant concentration dependency and reversibility of the protein folding&#8208;unfolding process, the resulting reshaping is highly tunable, reproducible, and chemically erasable, enabling consecutive shape transformations from a single hydrogel precursor. To impart full recyclability, irreversible crosslinking chemistry is replaced with a dynamic disulfide&#8208;based one. The resulting hydrogels can be fully recycled, and the recovered proteins can be reused to form new hydrogels, allowing for complete recycling and repeated remolding of hydrogels into new shapes without compromising their mechanical properties. This approach establishes a robust platform for developing next&#8208;generation protein&#8208;based materials with dynamic formability and true material circularity.

         <title>Inverted PAINT for Material&#8208;Specific Super&#8208;Resolution Fluorescence Imaging of Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents Inverted PAINT, a label&#8208;free super&#8208;resolution fluorescence imaging method optimized for thick and non&#8208;transparent semiconductor materials. By employing electrostatic dye&#8211;surface interactions in an inverted geometry, the technique enables material&#8208;specific, multicolor, and 3D nanoscale imaging, with applications in semiconductor metrology, defect detection, and analysis of various inorganic nanomaterials.








Abstract
Recent advances in super&#8208;resolution fluorescence microscopy have extended its application beyond traditional biological samples to include various organic materials such as polymers and lipid layers. However, its application to inorganic materials, including semiconductor substrates, still remains limited due to technical challenges associated with their thickness, optical opacity, and the lack of effective fluorophore labeling methods. To overcome these challenges, a label&#8208;free Inverted point accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (PAINT) imaging method is developed for thick and non&#8208;transparent inorganic nanomaterials by addressing the limitations of conventional PAINT imaging. By placing the sample in an inverted orientation and utilizing electrostatic interactions to control dye movement against gravity, silica&#8208;specific and silicon&#8208;specific nanoimaging of silica&#8211;silicon line&#8208; and hole&#8208;patterned semiconductor wafers, respectively is achieved. Through systematic optimization of polymer coating, dye charge, pH, refractive index, and dye concentration, it is demonstrated that the Inverted PAINT imaging method successfully visualizes sub&#8208;100&#160;nm line patterns with a resolution of &#8776;12&#160;nm, as well as enables multi&#8208;color and 3D nanoimaging. The method is anticipated to serve not only as a non&#8208;destructive and material&#8208;specific nanoimaging technique for a variety of inorganic nanomaterials, but also as a next&#8208;generation tool for semiconductor metrology and defect inspection.

         <title>Oxygen Spillover: Revolutionizing Catalytic Performance and Disrupting Mechanistic Paradigms in Sustainable Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review illuminates oxygen spillover as a transformative interfacial phenomenon that decouples adsorption/desorption energetics and reconfigures reaction pathways. It systematically details mechanistic principles, characterization advances, and rational catalyst design strategies across energy&#8208;critical reactions. By overcoming scaling relationships and stability limitations, oxygen spillover provides a universal framework for optimizing efficiency, selectivity, and durability in sustainable catalysis.








Abstract
Oxygen spillover, a dynamic interfacial phenomenon in catalysis, enables the migration of active oxygen species (*O, *OH) across catalyst interfaces, overcoming the limitations of traditional static active sites and establishing a new paradigm for optimizing catalytic performance in sustainable chemistry. This review systematically examines mechanistic advances in oxygen spillover and its applications in energy&#8208;related catalytic reactions (e.g., oxygen evolution reactions, oxygen reduction reactions, hydrogen evolution reactions, hydrogen oxidation reactions, organics oxidation reactions), highlighting its core advantage in decoupling intermediate adsorption/desorption energetics and reconstructing reaction kinetic pathways. By integrating in situ characterization and theoretical simulations, the regulatory mechanisms of electronic structure gradients, defect engineering, and heterojunction design on spillover kinetics are elucidated, along with rational design strategies for atomically precise catalysts. The oxygen spillover mechanism not only addresses the trilemma of catalytic efficiency&#8208;selectivity&#8208;stability but also provides unified design principles for cross&#8208;disciplinary catalytic systems, driving the paradigm shift in catalysis science from phenomenological description to predictive design.

         <title>A Noninvasive and Highly Effective Inhaled Nanovaccine Based on Natural Polysaccharide for Lung Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dextran&#8208;modified cationic vector is optimized for delivery Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) antigens. The assembled nanovaccine (dextran with N,N&#8208;dimethylethylenediamine and 4&#8208;(bromomethyl)phenylboronic acid (DDP/LLC) demonstrates potent adjuvant effects in promoting dendritic cell maturation. Remarkably, such nanovaccine demonstrates significant advantages over subcutaneous vaccination in activating of thoracic lymph node B cells and T follicular helper cells, as well as upregulation of tissue&#8208;resident memory T cells.








Abstract
Lung cancer is the most widespread malignancy globally and the leading cause of cancer&#8208;related deaths, highlighting the need for innovative treatments. Herein, a novel inhaled vaccine carrier is presented by modifying dextran (Dex) with N,N&#8208;dimethylethylenediamine (DMEN) and 4&#8208;(bromomethyl)phenylboronic acid (PBA) (Dex&#8211;DMEN&#8211;PBA, DDP). The optimized DDP demonstrates a potent adjuvant effect in promoting dendritic cell (DC) maturation by multiple signaling pathways. Moreover, the nanovaccine (DDP/Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC)) forms through electrostatic interactions between DDP and protein antigens derived from LLC cells. Upon inhalation, it induces DC maturation, T cell activation, and germinal center B cell activation in the thoracic lymph node. In the mouse model, the inhaled DDP/LLC nanovaccine displays impressive prophylactic effects against lung cancer, with 50% of mice alive after six months and 33% surviving a subsequent challenge, indicating strong long&#8208;term immune memory. Remarkably, it surpasses subcutaneous vaccination, particularly in activating germinal center B cells and follicular helper T (Tfh) cells, and upregulating tissue&#8208;resident memory T (TRM) cells in the lung. This self&#8208;adjuvant nanovaccine effectively prevents tumor growth and induces robust immune memory, offering valuable insight for treating lung cancer and related diseases.

&lt;p&gt;Dextran-modified cationic vector is optimized for delivery Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) antigens. The assembled nanovaccine (dextran with &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-dimethylethylenediamine and 4-(bromomethyl)phenylboronic acid (DDP/LLC) demonstrates potent adjuvant effects in promoting dendritic cell maturation. Remarkably, such nanovaccine demonstrates significant advantages over subcutaneous vaccination in activating of thoracic lymph node B cells and T follicular helper cells, as well as upregulation of tissue-resident memory T cells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lung cancer is the most widespread malignancy globally and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, highlighting the need for innovative treatments. Herein, a novel inhaled vaccine carrier is presented by modifying dextran (Dex) with &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-dimethylethylenediamine (DMEN) and 4-(bromomethyl)phenylboronic acid (PBA) (Dex&#8211;DMEN&#8211;PBA, DDP). The optimized DDP demonstrates a potent adjuvant effect in promoting dendritic cell (DC) maturation by multiple signaling pathways. Moreover, the nanovaccine (DDP/Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC)) forms through electrostatic interactions between DDP and protein antigens derived from LLC cells. Upon inhalation, it induces DC maturation, T cell activation, and germinal center B cell activation in the thoracic lymph node. In the mouse model, the inhaled DDP/LLC nanovaccine displays impressive prophylactic effects against lung cancer, with 50% of mice alive after six months and 33% surviving a subsequent challenge, indicating strong long-term immune memory. Remarkably, it surpasses subcutaneous vaccination, particularly in activating germinal center B cells and follicular helper T (Tfh) cells, and upregulating tissue-resident memory T (T&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt;) cells in the lung. This self-adjuvant nanovaccine effectively prevents tumor growth and induces robust immune memory, offering valuable insight for treating lung cancer and related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Ruthenium&#8211;Amino Acid Conjugates Enable Endoplasmic Reticulum&#8211;Nucleus Cascade Targeting for Cell Pyroptosis and DNA Destruction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel self&#8208;assembly delivery nanoplatform based on the direct coordination of amino acids with a Ru(II) center is developed, enabling targeting from the endoplasmic reticulum to the nucleus to induce pyroptosis and DNA damage. This distinctive conjugate achieved high therapeutic efficacy through combined photodynamic therapy and photoactivated chemotherapy, providing a transformative framework for the rational design of metallodrugs.








Abstract
The distinct photophysical and photochemical properties of ruthenium (Ru) complexes have made them potent therapeutic agents in photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT) for tumors. Simple synthesis, precise self&#8208;assembly delivery and specific subcellular distribution are essential for Ru complexes but remain significant challenges. Herein, a simple building block, Fmoc&#8211;methionine (Fmoc&#8211;M), is directly coordinated with a Ru center to construct a pH and light responsive Ru&#8211;amino acid conjugate (FmocRu), which directly self&#8208;assembles into nanoparticles, thus avoiding using polymeric and inorganic nanocarriers. Upon accumulation at the tumor site, the acidic microenvironment protonated the carboxyl groups in the amino acids, disrupting the supramolecular force balance and reducing particle size to enhance tumor penetration. The newly&#8208;formed small nanospheres exhibit programmable cascade targeting by first accumulating in the endoplasmic reticulum, then rapidly disassembling upon light irradiation to enable nuclear delivery of the released Ru complexes. This feature enabled FmocRu to induce cell death via the pyroptosis pathway and DNA damage. As a result, the Ru conjugate eliminated subcutaneous tumors and suppressed orthotopic breast tumor growth and metastasis in tumor&#8208;bearing mice model, offering a valuable platform to develop Ru complexes for anticancer research in PDT and PACT.

Rapid Formation of Core@Shell Heterostructures
In article number 2419790, Il&#8208;Doo Kim and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that ultrafast photothermal annealing enables the synthesis of metastable transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and carbides (TMCs) with precise structural and phase control. By reaching temperatures above 3000 K within milliseconds under ambient conditions, the method facilitates the formation of core@shell heterostructures and phase&#8208;transformed nanomaterials, which exhibit excellent catalytic performance for energy and environmental applications. Based on this concept, the proposed image visually captures the central concept of the study: the rapid formation of core@shell heterostructures comprising TMD shells and diverse core materials via millisecond&#8208;scale thermal shock.

         <title>Recent Progress on Liquid Superspreading and Its Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes current analysis on superspreading mechanisms through multiscale experiments/simulations/modeling, compares superspreading performance according to different scales of small structures, and highlights applications of superspreading in thermal management, functional films/membrane fabrication, real&#8208;time medical diagnostics, desalination, and liquid separation, etc.








Abstract
The dynamic spreading of liquids on solid surfaces is essential across numerous daily and industrial processes. Surfaces that enable liquid superspreading, characterized by rapid or extensive spreading, are particularly valuable due to their implications in functional film fabrication, heat management, liquid/liquid separation, and more. Recently, significant research is conducted on liquid superspreading surfaces, with microstructure&#8208;regulated surfaces gaining increasing attention. However, the deeper correlations between microstructural physical factors and the superspreading behaviors, along with the relevant applications, remain inadequately understood. This review aims to consolidate the existing knowledge from published results and stimulate further investigation by detailing structures, functionalities, and principles for constructing liquid superspreading surfaces. Examining is began by the energy balance between input and dissipation that underpins droplet spreading dynamics. Then current designs are reviewed for superspreading surfaces, with a focus on chemical and physical aspects, giving greater emphasis to the physical perspective. Additionally, several typical applications are categorized based on liquid superspreading behaviors across various fields. Finally, the prevailing challenges are highlighted and provide insights into future research directions.

Abstract
Achieving high&#8208;performance catalysts is imperative for clean energy and environmental applications. In this context, an expanding body of research underscores the critical significance of structural modifications, with lattice distortion emerging as an intrinsic reconfiguration of atomic arrangements that profoundly influences catalytic processes. By contrast, strain typically arises from interfacial mismatches or external forces. Building on these distinctions, this review systematically compares these concepts, examining their definitions, origins, criteria, characterization methods, and impacts on catalytic activity. Special emphasis is placed on the mechanistic roles of lattice distortion in catalysis, particularly its ability to enhance function through intrinsic structure modification, carrier migration dynamics modulation, surface chemistry modulation, and enhanced catalyst stability. Furthermore, the impact of lattice distortion on enhancing catalytic reactivity is elucidated by influencing molecular adsorption and activation, optimizing reaction pathways, tailoring active sites, and coupling with spin polarization effects to promote efficient catalytic performance. Finally, the remaining challenges and future outlook in the synergistic regulation of local distortion and strain, multi&#8208;scale dynamic in&#8208;situ characterization, and sustainable strategies for practical applications are discussed, offering valuable insights for advancing efficient and scalable chemical and energy transformation technologies.

         <title>Synchronization Strategy for Activity and Stability in Fenton&#8208;Like Single&#8208;Atom Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically summarizes recent advances in synchronization strategies for improving the activity and stability of Fenton&#8208;like single&#8208;atom catalysis, with a focus on the design principles and mechanisms of four key strategies: coordination engineering, confinement effects, carrier substitution, and catalytic module design. In addition, the auxiliary role of machine learning is evaluated in advancing these synchronization strategies. Key factors governing the stability/activity of SACs are highlighted, and future directions are proposed for developing next&#8208;generation catalysts with high efficiency and long&#8208;term durability for practical environmental remediation.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have garnered significant attention in the applications of environmental remediation based on Fenton&#8208;like systems. Current research on Fenton&#8208;like single&#8208;atom catalysis often emphasizes catalytic activity and mechanism regulation, while paying limited attention to the simultaneous enhancement of both activity and stability&#8212;a critical factor for the practical and scale&#8208;up applications of SACs. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in synchronization strategies for improving the activity and stability of Fenton&#8208;like single&#8208;atom catalysis, with a focus on the design principles and mechanisms of four key strategies: coordination engineering, confinement effects, carrier substitution, and catalytic module design. To the best of knowledge, this represents the first comprehensive review of Fenton&#8208;like single&#8208;atom catalysis from the perspective of concurrent optimization of activity and stability. Additionally, the auxiliary role of machine learning and lifecycle assessment (LCA) is evaluated in advancing these synchronization strategies. By investigating the interplay among different support materials, coordination configurations, and reaction environments, as well as enlarged modules, key factors governing the stability/activity of SACs are highlighted, and future directions are proposed for developing next&#8208;generation catalysts with high efficiency and long&#8208;term durability for practical environmental remediation.

A gel microneedle bioelectrodes device, with the enzymatic biofuel cells&#8208;based monitor strategy, wireless data capture and visualization model. This&#160;devices can track the physiological activities of diabetic rats within 180&#160;min. This device has potential in the fields of vital signs observation and AI&#8208;assisted monitoring and treatment integration equipment, opens new avenues for proactive disease management and personalized treatment strategies.








Abstract
Implementation of an enzymatic biofuel cell&#8208;based wearable device for the self&#8208;powered monitoring of dynamic biomarkers in interstitial fluid is crucial for precision medicine. Such devices are mainly limited by unimpaired immobilization and electron transformation of enzymes on electrode. Here, a gel microneedles bioelectrode utilized is designed by interfacial enzymatic polymerization from the aligned carbon fibers for initiating rigid gel shell array on surface, ensuring intact encapsulation of three oxidases with efficient substrate osmosis. Carbon nanotubes are employed to bridge each carbon fiber with the oxidase, accelerating the electrons transfer from active center of enzyme to external circuit. This strategy, which achieves a maximum power density of 1.98&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 at 20&#160;mm glucose as biofuel cell, with glucose detection limits as low as 0.2&#160;mm. Similarly, the detection limits for lactic acid and uric acid can be as low as 0.2 and 0.05&#160;mm. Validation in diabetic rats with the integration of data capture and an AI&#8208;assisted analyst system, enables precise detection of stimuli, such as food intake and exercise, allowing for the accurate prediction of biomarker dynamics in the next 20&#160;min. This integrated system marks a significant stride toward the realization of truly personalized and responsive healthcare solutions.

         <title>High Entropy Alloy Thin Films as Efficient Spin&#8208;Orbit Torque Sources for Spintronic Memories</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy alloys with significantly diluted heavy metal content are found to be a very efficient source of spin&#8208;orbit torques for spintronic applications. Epitaxially&#8208;grown 4&#8208;, 5&#8208;, 6&#8208;element alloy thin films are successfully integrated in magnetic racetrack memory devices, showing efficient domain wall motion, thereby adding a large family of materials to those that can be exploited for spin current generation.








Abstract
High entropy alloys (HEAs) containing multiple elements are emerging as advanced materials with enhanced functionalities. However, their use for spintronic applications remains elusive. Here, it is demonstrated that iridium based HEAs, grown by magnetron sputtering at room temperature, can be used as spin Hall layers. These films display highly efficient conversion of charge current into spin current. They also allow for the epitaxial growth of magnetic multilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy as well as synthetic antiferromagnets using a ternary RuAlGa antiferromagnetic coupling layer. It is demonstrated that iridium&#8208;based HEAs serve as effective sources of spin&#8208;orbit torque, as quantified by spin&#8208;torque ferromagnetic resonance and harmonic Hall measurements, enabling current&#8208;induced magnetization reversal and domain wall motion. The threshold current density for current&#8208;induced magnetization switching is found to be as low as &#8764;10 MA cm&#8722;2 with reproducible deterministic switching, and that domain walls in HEA&#8208;based racetracks can be driven at speeds of up to 300 m s&#8722;1 at a current density of 65 MA cm&#8722;2. These results show that HEAs should be considered for high&#8208;performance spintronic applications.

         <title>Decoding Chemo&#8208;Mechanical Failure Mechanisms of Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Battery Under Low Stack Pressure via Optical Fiber Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By FBG sensing the Li/electrolyte interfacial stress in solid&#8208;state battery, the Li metal anode failure reasons as dendrite&#8208;induced uneven stress distribution at electrode/electrolyte interface are disclosed. A Li&#8211;Sn composite anode is demonstrated effective in stabilizing the interface mechanics and the solid&#8208;state full cell performance at low stack pressures.








Abstract
All solid&#8208;state lithium (Li) metal batteries (ASSLBs) using ceramic&#8208;polymer hybrid solid electrolytes hold the promise for high&#8208;performance energy storage application, but they still suffer from the interfacial deterioration and dendritic Li penetration issues, particularly under low stack pressures. Therefore, understanding and mastering the underlying chemo&#8208;mechanical failure mechanisms become essential. Herein, the chemo&#8208;mechanical evolutions by operando monitoring the amplitude and heterogeneity of interfacial stress through an embedded optical fiber sensor are revealed. It is found that the uneven stripping/deposition of Li metal induces rapid and non&#8208;uniform stress growth at the interface, deteriorating interfacial contact with the Li&#8208;filament growth. Based on these insights, Li metal is replaced with an architectural lithium&#8208;tin anode, which demonstrates uniform stress and improved performance even under low stack pressure. This work not only offers a quantitative way to operando track the uniformity of interfacial stress but also provides critical insights into mastering the chemo&#8208;mechanics of ASSLBs.

         <title>Scaling Up Purcell&#8208;Enhanced Self&#8208;Assembled Nanoplasmonic Perovskite Scintillators into the Bulk Regime</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a scalable approach to enhancing bulk scintillators using nanoplasmonics. By integrating 100&#8208;nm silver nanoparticles with perovskite scintillator nanocrystals in a polymer matrix, significant improvements in light yield and decay rates via the Purcell effect are achieved. Experiments confirm up to 4.2&#8208;fold enhancements, offering a pathway for advanced radiation detection in medical imaging and security applications.









Abstract
Scintillators convert high&#8208;energy radiation into detectable photons and play a crucial role in medical imaging and security applications. The enhancement of scintillator performance through nanophotonics and nanoplasmonics, specifically using the Purcell effect, has shown promise but has so far been limited to ultrathin scintillator films because of the localized nature of this effect. This study introduces a method to expand the application of nanoplasmonic scintillators to the bulk regime. By integrating 100&#8208;nm&#8208;sized plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles with perovskite scintillator nanocrystals, nanoplasmonic scintillators are enabled to function effectively within bulk&#8208;scale devices. Power and decay rate enhancements of up to (3.20 &#177; 0.20) and (4.20 &#177; 0.31) folds are experimentally demonstrated for plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles, respectively, in a 5&#8208;mm thick CsPbBr3 nanocrystal&#8208;polymer scintillator at RT. Theoretical modeling also predicts similar enhancements of up to (2.26 &#177; 0.31) and (3.02 &#177; 0.69) folds for the same nanoparticle shapes and dimensions. Moreover, a (2.07 &#177; 0.39) fold increase in light yield under 241Am &#947;&#8208;excitation is demonstrated. These findings provide a viable pathway for utilizing nanoplasmonics to enhance bulk scintillator devices, advancing radiation detection&#160;technology.

         <title>Site Specific In3&#8314;&#8208;Alloying Unlocks Intense Photoluminescence and High Stability in Antimony Halide Hybrids for WLED and Anticounterfeiting Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, an In3+ alloyed antimony halide hybrid (C4H12N2)5[(SbCl5)2(InCl6)Cl4] exhibiting high stability, large stokes shift, and near unity photoluminescence quantum yield is successfully prepared, which is an excellent yellow phosphor for applications such as WLED lighting and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.








Abstract
While metal doping strategies have proven effective in regulating the bandgap and enhancing the photophysical properties of hybrid metal halides, site&#8208;specific atom alloying by mixing metals of different elements offers a new route for material modification. Here an antimony halide hybrid material with the formula of (C&#8324;H&#8321;&#8322;N&#8322;)&#8325;[(SbCl&#8325;)&#8322;(SbCl&#8326;)Cl&#8324;] (Py&#8208;SbCl) is shown with crystallographically independent alternating square pyramidal [SbCl&#8325;] and octahedral [SbCl&#8326;] sites sandwiched by organic layers. Interestingly, the octahedral site of the [SbCl&#8326;] can be fully replaced by the In3+ ions, forming the alloyed compound (C&#8324;H&#8321;&#8322;N&#8322;)&#8325;[(SbCl&#8325;)&#8322;(InCl&#8326;)Cl&#8324;] (Py&#8208;SbInCl). More importantly, the latter shows a near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield of 97%, which is &#8776;7 times of enhancement compared to the pristine Py&#8208;SbCl compound. This is mainly due to the much&#8208;enhanced Young's modulus, higher radiative decay rates and longer electron transient rates, presumably stemming from shorter In&#9472;Cl bond distances and higher dipole moments, as revealed by a cocktail study of X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal crystallography, density functional theory, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and so on. In addition, it is shown that Py&#8208;SbInCl is an excellent yellow phosphor that can be used for white light&#8208;emitting diodes and other applications such as counterfeiting. Therefore, making site&#8208;specific alloying compounds may open a new design approach for functional bimetallic hybrid materials.

         <title>Quaternary Layered Boride Ti4MoSiB2: A Structure&#8208;Function Integrated High&#8208;Temperature Self&#8208;Lubricating and Negative&#8208;Wear Material</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Out&#8208;of&#8208;plane chemically ordered Ti4MoSiB2 MAB materials with high phase content are synthesized. This material shows desirable comprehensive mechanical properties over a wide temperature range and excellent lubricating and wear resistance performance at high temperatures, since the typical crystal structure and tribological chemical reactions. This discovery opens a door to high&#8208;temperature wear&#8208;resistant structural materials.









Abstract
As a newly emerging class of materials, quaternary layered borides are promising structural&#8211;functional integration materials. However, there have been very few systematic and in&#8208;depth studies in many areas of these materials, including high&#8208;temperature lubrication. In this study, a novel out&#8208;of&#8208;plane chemically ordered Ti4MoSiB2 MAB phase material is synthesized and its mechanical and tribological properties are investigated over a wide temperature range. Experiments and calculations are conducted to determine its mechanical failure, friction, and wear mechanisms. The results indicate that the synthesized material maintains desirable comprehensive mechanical properties from room temperature to 1273 K and exhibits excellent lubricating and wear resistance performance at high temperatures. In this study, the operating principles of the anisotropic thermal expansion of crystals on the fracture behaviors, and the tribological chemical reactions and oxygen vacancies on tribological properties, are explained. This study is expected to provide a foundation for future practical applications in high&#8208;temperature environments.

         <title>Biomimetic Dynamics of Nanoscale Groove and Ridge Topography for Stem Cell Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic nanoscale groove&#8208;ridge structures are engineered by flexibly conjugating RGD&#8208;magnetic nanoparticles to nanogroove templates with variable groove widths at the molecular scale. Magnetic control enables cyclic switching between nanoscale groove and ridge states that modulates ligand accessibility of cellular integrins. The ligands in the ridge state reversibly promote integrin recruitment, adhesion, and differentiation of stem cells in vivo.








Abstract
Native extracellular matrix exhibits multiscale groove and ridge structures that continuously change, such as collagen fibril&#8208;based nanogrooves in bone tissue, and regulate cellular responses. However, dynamic switching between groove and ridge nanostructures at the molecular level has not been demonstrated. Herein, materials capable of dynamic groove&#8208;ridge switching at tens&#8208;of&#8208;nanometers scale are developed by flexibly conjugating RGD&#8208;magnetically activatable nanoridges (MANs) to non&#8208;magnetic nanogrooves with independently tuned widths comparable to the sizes of integrin&#8208;presenting filopodia by modulating hydrophobicity in bicontinuous microemulsion, allowing for cyclic modulation of RGD accessibility and cellular adhesion. Nanogrooves with medium width restrict RGD accessibility in the &#8220;groove&#8221; state in which the RGD&#8208;MANs are buried, which is reversed by magnetically raising them to protrude and form the &#8220;ridge&#8221; state that fully exposes the RGDs. This reversibly stimulates integrin recruitment, focal adhesion complex assembly, mechanotransduction, and differentiation of stem cells in vivo. This is the first demonstration of molecular&#8208;level groove and ridge nanostructures that exhibit unprecedented switchability between groove and ridge nanostructures. Versatile tuning of the width, height, pitch, and shape of intricate nanogroove structures with remote manipulability can enlighten the understanding of molecular&#8208;scale cell&#8211;ligand interactions for stem cell engineering&#8208;based treatment of aging, injuries, and stress&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Flash Thermal Shock Synthesis of Heterostructured Transition Metal Dichalcogenides and Carbides in Milliseconds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly active metastable transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and carbides (TMCs) face significant challenges in achieving precise control over their structure and phase. Here, ultrafast photothermal annealing is presented as an effective approach forsynthesizing TMDs and TMCs with precise structural and phase control. This process achieves temperatures exceeding 3000 K within milliseconds, enabling ambient&#8208;air synthesis of metastable nanomaterials featuring phase transition, core@shell heterostructures, and carbothermic reactions. The resulting materials exhibit high catalytic activity, opening avenues for customized applications in energy and environmental fields.








Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer remarkable potential for next&#8208;generation functional devices, but achieving ultrafast synthesis with precise structural and phase control under ambient conditions remains a significant challenge. Here, ultrafast photothermal annealing assisted by graphene oxide is introduced for precise phase control of TMDs forming a heterostructure. This process reaches adjustable temperatures between 1&#160;768 and 3&#160;162 K within 10&#160;ms, featuring rapid kinetics, enabling the synthesis of various metastable nanomaterials in ambient air. The TMDs form directly from precursors above 1&#160;700 K, while temperatures above 2&#160;300 K induce carbothermic reactions, producing metastable transition metal carbides (TMCs) and core@shell heterostructures (TMC@TMD and TMC@carbon). Introducing seed materials like single metals, metal oxides, and multielement/high&#8208;entropy alloys enables the formation of core(seed)@shell (TMD) heterostructures. The resulting composites demonstrated significantly enhanced catalytic performance in gas sensing and hydrogen production. This robust and versatile photothermal annealing method holds broad potential for designing advanced heterostructure&#8208;engineered TMD and/or TMC composites tailored for targeted applications.

         <title>Heat&#8208;Triggered Dynamic Self&#8208;Healing Framework for Variable&#8208;Temperature Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heat&#8208;triggered dynamic self&#8208;healing framework (HDSF) is developed to repair defects at grain boundaries, improving temperature stability in PSCs. HDSF, mainly located at the grain boundaries, stabilizes the perovskite lattice and relieves crystal stress through dynamic sulfide bond exchange. This approach led to a PCE of 26.32% (certified 25.84%) with enhanced thermal stability.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are promising as the next&#8208;generation photovoltaic technology. However, the inferior stability under various temperatures remains a significant obstacle to commercialization. Here, a heat&#8208;triggered dynamic self&#8208;healing framework (HDSF) is implemented to repair defects at grain boundaries caused by thermal variability, enhancing PSCs' temperature stability. HDSF, distributed at the grain boundaries and surface of the perovskite film, stabilizes the perovskite lattice and releases the perovskite crystal stress through the dynamic exchange reaction of sulfide bonds. The resultant PSCs achieved a power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.32% (certified 25.84%) with elevated temperature stability, retaining 88.7% of the initial PCE after 1000 h at 85&#160;&#176;C. In a variable temperature cycling test (between &#8722;40 and 80&#160;&#176;C), the HDSF&#8208;treated device retained 87.6% of its initial PCE at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C and 92.6% at 80&#160;&#176;C after 160 thermal cycles. This heat&#8208;triggered dynamic self&#8208;healing strategy could significantly enhance the reliability of PSCs in application scenarios.

         <title>Differential Optical Imaging of Antigen Presentation Machinery Using Molecular Optical Reporters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular optical reporters with fluorescence or chemiluminescence are synthesized to dynamically and noninvasively detect major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC&#8208;I) and MHC&#8208;II antigen presentations in lymph nodes. They are validated across cancer, bacterial, and viral models with high sensitivity and minimal signal crosstalk.








Abstract
Detection of antigen presentation is central to understanding immunological processes and developing therapeutics for cancer, infectious diseases, and allergies. However, methods with the ability to dynamically and noninvasively distinguish between major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC&#8208;I) and MHC&#8208;II antigen presentations remain lacking. Herein, we develop activatable molecular optical reporters (MORs) for real&#8208;time differential imaging of antigen presentations in lymph nodes (LNs). These MORs are engineered to passively target LNs and activated through proteolytic cleavage by key enzymes in the MHC&#8208;I and MHC&#8208;II pathways, the immunoproteasome (iP) and cathepsin S (CTSS), respectively, triggering their chemiluminescent or fluorescent signals. Coupled with minimized signal crosstalk and high sensitivity, MORs delineate the subtle differences in the antigen presentation machinery across various disease models, including cancer and bacterial or viral infection, a feat unattainable for existing imaging methods. After systemic administration, MORs also allow real&#8208;time visualization of antigen presentation in the tumor microenvironment. Besides, MORs are validated to have potential for preclinical application in immunotherapeutics screening and clinical application in tissue biopsy. Thus, our study not only presents the first example of real&#8208;time, in vivo differential imaging of antigen presentation pathways but also opens new avenues for optical probes in immune contexture analysis.

         <title>Multiplex Methionine Modulating Hydrogel for Cancer Metabolic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiplex methionine modulating hydrogel (3 M Gel) is fabricated as a type of dual&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive drug delivery system, enabling in situ triple intervention of intracellular methionine metabolism and extracellular methionine uptake. This multilayered methionine blockade strategy achieves superior antitumor efficacy without systemic side effects in breast, liver, and colorectal cancers, and effectively overcomes tumor resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy.








Abstract
The reliance on high levels of methionine by tumor cells provides an attractive target for cancer treatment. However, systemic methionine blockade may raise concerns about potential side effects given the broad and essential functions of methionine in cellular metabolism. Here, a combined drug delivery platform for multilayered constraint of methionine within tumor lesions is developed. Small molecule inhibitors PF9366 and adenosine dialdehyde are encapsulated by tumor cell&#8208;targeting nanoparticles (NPs) to achieve a cascaded blockage of intracellular methionine metabolism. These NPs are further co&#8208;loaded with the extracellular methionine uptake inhibitor JPH203 into a type of reactive oxygen species&#8208;sensitive hydrogel, assembling the multiplex methionine modulating hydrogel (3&#160;M Gel). In murine models of triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC), hepatocellular carcinoma, and colorectal cancer, the in situ formed 3&#160;M Gel exhibits superior efficacy in restricting S&#8208;adenosyl methionine generation and histone methylation, stimulating immunogenic cell death in tumor cells, thereby eliciting potent innate and adaptive immune responses to restrain tumor progression. Moreover, remodeling of the tumor microenvironment by 3&#160;M Gel overcomes immune checkpoint blockade resistance in TNBC.

     alt="Multiplex Methionine Modulating Hydrogel for Cancer Metabolic Therapy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiplex methionine modulating hydrogel (3 M Gel) is fabricated as a type of dual-stimuli-responsive drug delivery system, enabling in situ triple intervention of intracellular methionine metabolism and extracellular methionine uptake. This multilayered methionine blockade strategy achieves superior antitumor efficacy without systemic side effects in breast, liver, and colorectal cancers, and effectively overcomes tumor resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reliance on high levels of methionine by tumor cells provides an attractive target for cancer treatment. However, systemic methionine blockade may raise concerns about potential side effects given the broad and essential functions of methionine in cellular metabolism. Here, a combined drug delivery platform for multilayered constraint of methionine within tumor lesions is developed. Small molecule inhibitors PF9366 and adenosine dialdehyde are encapsulated by tumor cell-targeting nanoparticles (NPs) to achieve a cascaded blockage of intracellular methionine metabolism. These NPs are further co-loaded with the extracellular methionine uptake inhibitor JPH203 into a type of reactive oxygen species-sensitive hydrogel, assembling the multiplex methionine modulating hydrogel (3&#160;M Gel). In murine models of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), hepatocellular carcinoma, and colorectal cancer, the in situ formed 3&#160;M Gel exhibits superior efficacy in restricting S-adenosyl methionine generation and histone methylation, stimulating immunogenic cell death in tumor cells, thereby eliciting potent innate and adaptive immune responses to restrain tumor progression. Moreover, remodeling of the tumor microenvironment by 3&#160;M Gel overcomes immune checkpoint blockade resistance in TNBC. This study presents a localized triple regulation strategy and paves a new path for amino acid starvation-based cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Explainable Artificial Intelligence Elucidates Synthesis&#8208;Structure&#8208;Property&#8208;Function Relationships in Nanostructured Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated data&#8208;driven and experimental workflow that maps synthesis&#8208;structure&#8208;property&#8208;function relationships in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions is presented. The framework uncovers structural insights that reinforce established chemical principles and reveal properties beyond conventional understanding, highlighting the power of data science to find novel trends in catalytic data and guide experiments.








Abstract
Designing high&#8208;performance catalysts based on supported metal atoms and nanoparticles necessitates rigorous assembly control, which affects reactivity. Yet, attaining synthesis precision to discern catalyst speciation and properties remains challenging. This limitation is tackled by pioneering an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methodology that combines a decision tree classifier and a random forest regressor sequentially to elucidate synthesis&#8208;structure&#8208;property&#8208;function relationships in nanostructured catalysts, exemplified for the oxygen evolution (OER) and hydrogen evolution (HER) reactions. The decision tree accurately predicts the formation of single atoms versus nanoparticles for 37 metals anchored on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon, identifying the metal's standard reduction potential and cohesive energy as determinants of speciation. The random forest regressor correlates the electrocatalytic performance of synthesized single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) to intrinsic properties, revealing a volcano&#8208;like relationship of current density with the electronegativity of the active site and metal&#8208;support interaction, providing insights beyond traditional adsorption energy descriptors. The integrated models are validated experimentally with an overall accuracy of over 80%, establishing user confidence. This XAI framework, adaptable to diverse synthetic protocols and material classes is a powerful tool to understand synthesis&#8208;structure&#8208;property&#8208;function relationships and promote data&#8208;informed experiments with reduced characterization efforts.

         <title>Cleanly Removable and Degradable Bio&#8208;Based Adhesive for Flexible Displays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sustainable acrylic optically clear adhesives (OCAs) for foldable displays are developed by incorporating ultraviolet (UV)&#8208;triggered debondability and lipoic acid&#8211;based degradability through visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced bulk polymerization. These OCAs enable residue&#8208;free removal and degrade into small oligomers or recoverable monomers under mild conditions, supporting substrate recycling and adhesive recovery in next&#8208;generation flexible electronics.








Abstract
In advanced applications such as flexible displays, reusing components is essential for achieving sustainability. However, the removal of acrylic pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives (PSAs), which bond these components, remains a major challenge due to residue formation and the non&#8208;degradable C&#9472;C backbone. Here, the development of new acrylic PSA alternatives for foldable displays is reported by introducing ultraviolet (UV)&#8208;triggered debondability, degradability through lipoic acid analogs, and a visible&#8208;light&#8208;curing process. PSAs composed of 60 mol% lipoic acid ethyl ester (LpEt)&#160;and 3 mol% UV&#8208;cross&#8208;linkable benzophenone&#8208;functionalized acrylic monomers exhibit viscoelastic properties comparable to those of conventional acrylic PSAs, while also enable clean removal from substrates after use. Following removal, the PSAs efficiently degrade into small molecular units in the presence of a green reductant or can be recovered as monomers under controlled conditions. This strategy offers a promising pathway toward sustainable PSAs, enables the recycling of valuable substrates from flexible display modules while simultaneously allows adhesive recovery, thus presents a viable alternative to conventional acrylic adhesives.

         <title>Control of Chemical Doping&#8208;Mediated Space Charge for Energetic Band&#8208;Switching Modulation in Low&#8208;Noise Shortwave&#8208;Infrared Organic Photodetector</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates chemical doping effects on spatial charge distributions in SWIR organic photodetectors (OPDs). Defect control through doping concentration enables energetic band modulation, reducing dark current and lowering noise&#8208;equivalent power to pico&#8208;scale levels. The findings advance low&#8208;noise SWIR OPDs, highlighting spatial defect engineering as a key strategy for improving carrier dynamics and device performance.








Abstract
This study investigates the influence of chemical doping on the spatial&#8208;charge distributions and carrier&#8208;tunneling mechanisms in single&#8208;polymer shortwave&#8208;infrared (SWIR) photomultiplication (PM)&#8208;organic photodetectors (OPDs). By systematically analyzing the optical and photoelectric properties influenced by chemical doping, it is identified that dopant&#8208;induced defects as space charges significantly contribute to Fowler&#8211;Nordheim (FN) tunneling, thereby impacting the performance of SWIR OPDs. At a doping concentration of 0.5&#160;mm, the formation of positively charged carriers (polarons and/or bipolarons) within the polymer matrix initiates, thereby facilitating SWIR absorption and contributing to the balance between photocurrent and noise by mitigating FN tunneling through the reduction of defect density (ND). However, as the doping concentration exceeds 5&#160;mm, the increased ND accumulates more space charge, accelerating FN tunneling. This enhances photocurrent generation and amplifies noise disproportionately, ultimately limiting OPD performance. Under ND&#8208;minimized optimum doping concentration (at 0.5&#160;mm), the OPD exhibited a noise equivalent power of 9.85 pW (at &#8722;8&#160;V, bandwidth = 1&#160;Hz, and wavelength = 1490&#160;nm), and a linear dynamic range of 42&#160;dB. These findings demonstrate the role of chemical doping in enhancing the performance of SWIR PM&#8208;OPDs, paving the way for advanced photonic sensors.

         <title>Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries with Superlong Cycle&#8208;Life in Wide Temperature Range via Interfacial Alkyl&#8208;Chain Sway</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work has designed a wide&#8208;temperature lithium&#8208;ion battery with a bionic&#8208;drive cathode interphase. The 15 nm ultrafine nano&#8208;Mg(OH)2 with Tween80 (nano&#8208;MHs@Tween80) are introduced into the LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2. The nano&#8208;MHs accelerate to form a stable inorganic CEI. The Tween80 molecules improve electrolyte flow and facilitate efficient lithium&#8208;ion transport by the alkyl&#8208;chain sway. The cycle&#8208;life of the battery is significantly prolonged in a wide temperature range.








Abstract
The cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase directly influences the wide&#8208;temperature performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, particularly long&#8208;term cycle performance. However, improving both high&#8208; and low&#8208;temperature properties of cathode often requires distinct approaches, making it challenging to unify these strategies. In this work, an interfacial&#8208;driven strategy on the cathode surface is designed with nano&#8208;Mg(OH)2 with Tween80 (nano&#8208;Mg(OH)2@Tween80). Tween80 serves as the framework of the weak&#8208;linked flexible confined space for preparing ultrafine nano&#8208;Mg(OH)2 and then adsorbs in situ onto the nano&#8208;Mg(OH)2. In the cell assembled with nano&#8208;Mg(OH)2@Tween80 modified LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2, the alkyl&#8208;chain sway of Tween80 molecules accelerates electrolyte diffusion on cathode surface. Hence, both the timely formation of a stable and conductive Mg&#8208;rich interphase layer and rapid lithium&#8208;ion transfer are achieved, leading to the co&#8208;improvement of high/low&#8208;temperature performances. The half&#8208;cell with the addition of nano&#8208;Mg(OH)2@Tween80, maintains over 70 mAh&#183;g&#8722;1 and 90% Coulombic efficiency after 1000 cycles at 60&#160;&#176;C, and keeps 80 mAh&#183;g&#8722;1 with 99% Coulombic efficiency after 500 cycles at &#8722;5&#160;&#176;C, even still very stable at &#8722;15&#160;&#176;C.

In the cell assembled with nano-Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@Tween80 modified LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the alkyl-chain sway of Tween80 molecules accelerates electrolyte diffusion on cathode surface. Hence, both the timely formation of a stable and conductive Mg-rich interphase layer and rapid lithium-ion transfer are achieved, leading to the co-improvement of high/low-temperature performances. The half-cell with the addition of nano-Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@Tween80, maintains over 70 mAh&#183;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 90% Coulombic efficiency after 1000 cycles at 60&#160;&#176;C, and keeps 80 mAh&#183;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with 99% Coulombic efficiency after 500 cycles at &#8722;5&#160;&#176;C, even still very stable at &#8722;15&#160;&#176;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Functionally Segregated Ion Regulation Enables Dual Confinement Effect for Highly Stable Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A functionally segregated ion regulation strategy is developed, incorporating ion&#8208;functional groups into the hydrogel electrolyte to achieve a dual confinement effect and regulate Zn2+ flux. This approach effectively suppresses the polyiodide shuttle effect and strengthens the electrochemical stability of Zn anodes, enabling aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries with high areal capacity and a record&#8208;long lifespan.








Abstract
Conventional electrolytes in aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries struggle to suppress the shuttle effect and enhance interfacial stability, resulting in high self&#8208;discharge rate, low areal capacity, and short cycle life. To address these issues, a dual&#8208;confinement hydrogel electrolyte (DCHE) is designed to simultaneously stabilize the iodine cathode and zinc anode at high areal capacities via a functionally segregated ion regulation strategy. As for the cathode, anion&#8208;functional groups in the DCHE repel polyiodides, while cation&#8208;functional groups adsorb those that escape repulsion, thereby reinforcing the suppression of polyiodide migration toward the zinc anode. This dual confinement effect, validated by theoretical simulations and in situ characterization, effectively mitigates the shuttle effect. Additionally, hydrophilic and zincophilic functional groups regulate the hydrogen&#8208;bond network and Zn2+ flux, strengthening the electrochemical stability of the zinc anode. As a result, a Zn//ZnI2 cell assembled with DCHE delivers a practical areal capacity of 4.5&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 and achieves a record&#8208;long lifespan exceeding 6000&#160;h with 88.9% capacity retention at 100&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1. Furthermore, the single&#8208;layer pouch cell exhibits good mechanical stability, retaining 80% of its capacity after 100 cycles of 90&#176; bending. This work highlights the importance of functionally segregated ion regulation in advancing high&#8208;performance aqueous batteries.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Engineered Modular Nanovaccines Featuring Precise Topology for Enhanced Immunogenicity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA&#8208;programmed topological assembly approach to prescribe the receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) from SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 with line&#8208;shaped and branched connection. It is found that branching&#8208;connected RBDs induced stronger humoral immunity than linear&#8208;connected RBDs, potentially due to enhanced antigen&#8208;B cell receptor synergistic interactions.








Abstract
Multivalent display of antigens can boost subunit vaccine immunogenicity. However, owing to the inherent difficulty in programmatically controlling the topology of multivalent antigens, its impact on antigen immunogenicity remains elusive. In this study, DNA&#8208;mediated modular precision assembly is employed to organize SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 receptor&#8208;binding domains (RBDs) with different topological connections while preserving their epitopes. It is found that branching&#8208;connected RBDs induced significantly higher IgG titers than linear&#8208;connected RBDs at higher antigen valency (&#8805;4). This increase in IgG response is associated with stronger B cell proliferation, likely due to enhanced antigen&#8208;receptor synergistic interactions leading to enhanced B cell receptor signaling. Branching&#8208;connected RBDs also provided superior humoral immunity in mice and stronger protection in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;infected hamsters compared to adjuvanted RBD. This work highlights the role of antigen topology in vaccine design and offers a universal modular platform for producing more effective subunit vaccines.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Ocular Delivery of Brain&#8208;Derived Neurotrophic Factor and Oligomycin for Neuroprotection in Glaucoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional gene&#8211;drug co&#8208;delivery nanoplatform targeting M&#252;ller cells is developed to safeguard retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and restore optic nerve function in glaucoma. Multifunctional PPOB nanoparticles achieve high&#8208;efficiency (64.26%) and sustained (14.5 days) gene expression of BDNF. Combined with oligomycin, they effectively inhibit &#160;the apoptosis of RGCs and confer superior optic nerve protection in an 8&#8208;week treatment.








Abstract
Glaucoma is a retinal neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and irreversible visual impairment. Current therapies rarely offer direct&#160;protection for RGCs, highlighting the need for new neuroprotective approaches. Although viral delivery of brain&#8208;derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has shown potential, concerns about retinal inflammation and limited applicability persist. Meanwhile, non&#8208;viral vectors remain inefficient for in vivo ocular gene delivery. Here, a highly biocompatible nanoplatform&#8212;PBAE&#8208;PLGA&#8208;Oligomycin&#8208;pBDNF nanoparticles (PPOB NPs) is reported&#8212;that co&#8208;delivers oligomycin (an ATP inhibitor) and a BDNF plasmid to M&#252;ller cells in vivo. This nanoplatform attains an unprecedented transfection efficiency of 64.26% in M&#252;ller cells, thereby overcoming the limitations of monotherapeutic neurotrophic approaches that fail to inhibit ATP overproduction and attendant inflammatory responses. In a chronic ocular hypertension rat model, oligomycin effectively mitigated RGC damage by suppressing M&#252;ller cell&#160;hyperactivation and excessive ATP production under elevated intraocular pressure. Concurrently, it synergistically enhanced BDNF expression in M&#252;ller cells, achieving robust protection of RGCs and preservation of optic nerve function. These findings underscore the promise of PPOB NPs as a dual&#8208;functional platform, featuring high biocompatibility and efficient gene delivery, for multifaceted therapies against glaucoma and other ocular diseases.

         <title>3D Printing of Ultrahigh Filler Content Composites Enabled by Granular Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for directly printing ultrahigh filler content composites is presented, whereby granular hydrogels are incorporated into rigid filler particle flow, leading to polymer&#8208;based composites with a filler content of up to 99.2&#160;wt.%. Granular hydrogels weaken the stability of arches through elastic deformation, thus mitigating clogging caused by bridging. This strategy offers a promising route for manufacturing 3D composites with exceptionally high filler content.









Abstract
Ultrahigh filler content composites have exhibited distinctive properties in various areas, such as structural materials, electrical insulation, thermal management, and energy storage devices. However, manufacturing 3D composites with ultrahigh filler content is challenging because excessive fillers have compromised the processing flowability of the composite. Here, using hollow glass microspheres (HGMs) as an example filler, a 3D printing strategy for fabricating particulate composites with ultrahigh HGM content (up to 99.2&#160;wt.%) is reported. By incorporating the highly swollen granular hydrogel as the shear sliding phase between HGMs, the probability of clogging during extrusion of the composite ink with ultrahigh HGM content is substantially reduced. A quantitative phase diagram is developed to optimally choose the ink compositions with the maximum HGM content, as well as printing parameters. The resulting composite with ultrahigh HGM content shows ceramic&#8208;foam&#8208;like brittle fracture behavior, high wave&#8208;transparent properties (0.996), and low thermal conductivity (0.045&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1). Further, a thermal shield with high HGM content on a microcircuit board to validate the localized thermal protection is fabricated. It is believed that incorporating hydrogel matrix into the printing ink will unlock the capabilities of 3D printed ultrahigh filler content composites in creating more intricate structures with advanced functionalities.

         <title>Co&#8208;Implementing Optimized Volmer and Heyrovsky Reactions in Hydrogen Production via Composite Active Sites on Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Carriers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Comprehensive optimization of both Volmer and Heyrovsky steps in alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction has been achieved by the synergistic catalysis of composite active sites combined Pt single&#8208;atoms with Pt nanoclusters on an electron&#8208;withdrawing defective boron nitride carrier, which results in superior intrinsic activity with an impressive turnover frequency and a remarkable long&#8208;term durability.








Abstract
The trade&#8208;off of the Volmer reaction for *H formation and the Heyrovsky/Tafel Reaction for *H desorption is a crucial challenge in alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Thus, aside from the conventional construction of bifunctional active sites to accelerate the water dissociation step, the electronic retrimming of each metal site is also non&#8208;negligible. Herein, an efficient HER electrocatalyst combining Pt single&#8208;atoms and Pt nanoparticles on the etched boron nitride (eBN) coated carbon nanotube (Pt&#8208;eBN@CNT) is synthesized, where both the Volmer and Heyrovsky steps are promoted by the synergistic adsorption of the composite active sites and the electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of eBN carrier, respectively. The proposed catalyst shows impressive performance in alkaline media with an overpotential of 25.1&#160;&#177; 1.7 mV at 10 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, and a TOF of 17.1 &#177; 1.3 s&#8722;1 at 0.15 V vs RHE under extremely low metal loading of 6 &#181;gPt&#160;cm&#8722;2 (catalyst loading of 0.77 mg&#160;cm&#8722;2), significantly better than those for the commercial benchmark Pt/C (44.2 &#177; 4.1 mV, 0.9 &#177; 0.1 s&#8722;1 at catalyst loading of 0.77 mg&#160;cm&#8722;2; 156.1 &#177; 0.6 mV, 1.6 &#177; 0.1 s&#8722;1 at metal loading of 6 &#181;gPt&#160;cm&#8722;2) under the same conditions. Moreover, a membrane&#8208;electrode&#8208;assembly (MEA) electrolyzer with Pt&#8208;eBN@CNT as the cathodic catalyst exhibits a notable charge transfer amount (stands for a long service life) of 2.0 &#215; 106 C&#183;cm&#8722;2 within high&#8208;temperature electrocatalysis at 1.0 A&#183;cm&#8722;2, significantly higher than those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts. This work demonstrates the important role of active&#8208;site combination coupled with carrier effect in optimizing the kinetics of multi&#8208;step electrocatalytic reaction.

         <title>Strong MXene Induced Conductive Silk Fibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong MXene induced conductive silk fibers (MCSFs) are fabricated from inspiration of the core&#8208;sheath structure of Bombyx mori silks. The MCSFs with tensile strength of 1037.9 MPa and excellent electrical conductivity of 6400 S m&#8722;1, demonstrate multifunctional performance to monitor human pulse, body movements, and changes of ambient humidity in real time.








Abstract
Conductive silk fibers (CSFs) are attractive in the field of flexible wearable electronics and textiles, but it still exists a great challenge to simultaneously enhance the electrical conductivity and mechanical properties. Inspired by the core&#8208;sheath structure of Bombyx mori silks, a continuous strategy is demonstrated for the fabrication the strong MXene induced conductive silk fibers (MCSFs). The sericin sheath of silk fibers (SFs) is replaced by MXene/sodium alginate (MSA) layer, and the ultrathin sheath layer is tightly bridged with the core through strong interfacial interactions, including hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions. Therefore, the MCSFs show extraordinary tensile strength of 1037.9&#160;MPa and outstanding electrical conductivity of 6400 S m&#8722;1, which exhibits obvious advantages compared with the previous reported silk fibers modified by other methods. In addition, the MCSFs also have a high toughness of 194.9&#160;MJ m&#8722;3 and an ultra&#8208;sensitive gauge factor of 2269.3, resulting in their ability to monitor human pulse, body movements, and changes of ambient humidity in real time. The proposed bioinspired strategy for continuously fabricating ultra&#8208;strong and tough MCSFs provides an avenue for implementing functionalized silk fibers in next&#8208;generation wearable technologies, intelligent textiles, and human&#8208;machine interaction etc.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Conjugated Microporous Hydrocarbon Electrodes for High&#8208;Capacity and High&#8208;Voltage Lithium&#8208;Ion Capacitors</title>

High&#8208;capacity and high&#8208;voltage &#960;&#8208;conjugated microporous hydrocarbon electrodes are designed and prepared for lithium&#8208;ion capacitors, featuring a large &#960;&#8208;conjugated planar structure with sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms to facilitate rapid electron migration; abundant oxygen&#8208;free edge C(sp2)&#8211;H sites for efficient ion storage within nanopores; and a well&#8208;developed internal nanopore structure to enhance ion diffusion. Accordingly, the symmetric capacitor achieved unprecedented energy density and power density.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based cathodes are widely utilized in lithium&#8208;ion capacitors due to their superior cycle stability, safety, and tolerance to overcharging compared to oxide&#8208;based cathodes. However, the limited capacity of carbon cathodes, primarily governed by the electric double&#8208;layer capacitance mechanism, constrains their energy storage potential. Conventional strategies like increasing surface area and pore volume have provided marginal improvements, while heteroatom doping has been restricted by low working voltage and compromised conductivity. To overcome these limitations, a novel class of &#960;&#8208;conjugated microporous hydrocarbons (CMHs) is developed using sub&#8208;graphitic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) as building blocks. These materials PPe, PPy, and PAn feature carbon&#8208;like large &#960;&#8208;conjugated surfaces, abundant oxygen&#8208;free edge C(sp2)&#8211;H sites, and well&#8208;defined microporous structures, facilitating anion adsorption and ion transport. Among them, PPe demonstrates exceptional performance with a high voltage of 3.13 V vs Li+/Li, a remarkable capacity of 241 mAh g&#8722;1 2.5 times of commercial activated carbon (YP50), and exceptional rate performance (up to 50 A g&#8722;1), far surpassing all other reported LIC cathode materials. These findings provide a fundamental design strategy for carbon&#8208;based cathodes in LICs that highlighting the role of &#960;&#8208;conjugation and edge chemistry in electrochemical performance, paving the way for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;capacity, high&#8208;voltage energy storage devices.

         <title>Ultrabroadband (Vis&#8208;NIR) Emission in Single&#8208;Component Perovskite LEDs via Tailored Multi&#8208;Exciton Energy Transfer Pathways</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A promising strategy is introduced by tailoring multi&#8208;exciton energy transfer pathways in Sb3&#8314;/Ln3&#8314; co&#8208;doped Cs&#8322;HfCl&#8326; nanocrystals to achieve ultrabroadband Vis&#8208;to&#8208;NIR emission. The resulting single&#8208;component Sb3&#8314;/Pr3&#8314; LED exhibits broadband emission up to &#8776;1200 nm, spectral quality (CRI &#8764;98.1, R9 &#8764;98), high PLQY (&gt;80%), and stable operation over 50 h.








Abstract
The development of ultrabroadband light sources spanning the visible (Vis) to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) range is of fundamental importance for cutting&#8208;edge applications in communication, metrology, and quantum technologies. Although phosphor&#8208;converted LEDs have extended emission, they still suffer from spectral gaps, inadequate color rendering, and constrained NIR output. Here, a promising approach is introduced by tailoring multi&#8208;exciton energy transfer pathways to realize ultrabroadband Vis&#8208;to&#8208;NIR emission in Sb3&#8314;/Ln3&#8314; co&#8208;doped vacancy&#8208;ordered Cs&#8322;HfCl&#8326; perovskite nanocrystals. By systematically optimizing Sb3&#8314; and Ln3&#8314; doping concentrations, excitation wavelengths, and lanthanide ion selection, the energy transfer pathways between singlet and triplet self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) states and lanthanide energy levels are modulated. This design facilitates broad spectral tunability through energy distribution control among emission centers, improves radiative efficiency by reducing energy losses during transfer processes, and promotes stable performance by mitigating excessive energy accumulation. The resulting single&#8208;component LED based on Sb3&#8314;/Pr3&#8314; co&#8208;doped NCs delivers broadband emission extending to &#8776;1200 nm, high spectral quality (CRI &#8764; 98.1, R9 &#8764; 98), strong visible/NIR PLQY (&#8776;80%), and steady operation over 50 h. The findings provide insight into energy transfer engineering in low&#8208;dimensional perovskites and offer a viable route toward emerging ultrabroadband solid&#8208;state light sources.

&lt;p&gt;A promising strategy is introduced by tailoring multi-exciton energy transfer pathways in Sb&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314;/Ln&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314; co-doped Cs&#8322;HfCl&#8326; nanocrystals to achieve ultrabroadband Vis-to-NIR emission. The resulting single-component Sb&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314;/Pr&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314; LED exhibits broadband emission up to &#8776;1200 nm, spectral quality (CRI &#8764;98.1, R9 &#8764;98), high PLQY (&amp;gt;80%), and stable operation over 50 h.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of ultrabroadband light sources spanning the visible (Vis) to near-infrared (NIR) range is of fundamental importance for cutting-edge applications in communication, metrology, and quantum technologies. Although phosphor-converted LEDs have extended emission, they still suffer from spectral gaps, inadequate color rendering, and constrained NIR output. Here, a promising approach is introduced by tailoring multi-exciton energy transfer pathways to realize ultrabroadband Vis-to-NIR emission in Sb&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314;/Ln&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314; co-doped vacancy-ordered Cs&#8322;HfCl&#8326; perovskite nanocrystals. By systematically optimizing Sb&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314; and Ln&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314; doping concentrations, excitation wavelengths, and lanthanide ion selection, the energy transfer pathways between singlet and triplet self-trapped exciton (STE) states and lanthanide energy levels are modulated. This design facilitates broad spectral tunability through energy distribution control among emission centers, improves radiative efficiency by reducing energy losses during transfer processes, and promotes stable performance by mitigating excessive energy accumulation. The resulting single-component LED based on Sb&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314;/Pr&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314; co-doped NCs delivers broadband emission extending to &#8776;1200 nm, high spectral quality (CRI &#8764; 98.1, R9 &#8764; 98), strong visible/NIR PLQY (&#8776;80%), and steady operation over 50 h. The findings provide insight into energy transfer engineering in low-dimensional perovskites and offer a viable route toward emerging ultrabroadband solid-state light sources.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cyclable Micron&#8208;Sized Silicon&#8208;Based Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries at &#8722;40 &#176;C Enabled by Temperature&#8208;Dependent Solvation Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low&#8208;temperature cyclability of micron&#8208;sized silicon anodes is successfully achieved by leveraging temperature&#8208;adaptive ion&#8208;dipole interactions, where the remarkable CIPs&#8208;dominated solvation structure at low temperatures facilitates Li+ desolvation and the formation of a thin, robust SEI, thereby enabling an unprecedentedly high capacity of 786 mAh g&#8315;1 after 100 cycles at &#8211;40 &#176;C under 0.1 A g&#8315;1.









Abstract
Micron&#8208;sized silicon (&#181;Si) anodes hold great promise for high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, the rechargeable cyclability of &#181;Si anodes at sub&#8208;zero Celsius, especially below &#8722;20 &#176;C remains challenging, caused by the severe volume change and cracking of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) during cycling. Here, the low&#8208;temperature cyclability of &#181;Si&#8208;based LIBs is realized by using an electrolyte featured with temperature&#8208;adaptive ion&#8208;dipole interactions. The synergistic effect of the methyl group as a weak electron donor and the electronegative fluorine atoms endows methyl difluoroacetate (MDFA) with a weak binding affinity for Li+. Moreover, the affinity between Li+ and the oxygen atoms in both MDFA and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) decreases at lower temperatures, accompanied by a temperature&#8208;responsive enhancement of Li+&#8208;anion coordination. Thus, the MDFA/FEC electrolyte exhibits an extraordinary contact ion pairs&#8208;dominated solvation structure at subzero temperatures, which facilitates Li+ desolvation and the formation of a thin, robust inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. As expected, &#181;Si anodes show a record&#8208;breaking capacity of 786 mAh g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles at &#8722;40 &#176;C under 0.1 A g&#8722;1, and &#181;Si&#8208;based full cells display impressive rechargeability at &#8722;40 &#176;C. This work paves the way for extending the applications of &#181;Si anodes to extreme cold conditions.

         <title>Untying the Knot: A Fully Recyclable, Solvent&#8208;Free, Wide&#8208;Spectral Photocurable Thermoset Adhesive</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a solvent&#8208;free, recyclable adhesive that cures rapidly under visible light (400&#8211;650 nm) while maintaining robust adhesion across diverse substrates. Recyclable via simple microwave irradiation, it combines high performance with optical and bioadaptive potential, representing a significant advancement toward sustainable, circular&#8208;economy&#8208;compatible adhesive technologies.








Abstract
Adhesives are vital in industries ranging from aerospace to consumer electronics. However, their reliance on non&#8208;recyclable polymers makes them suitable for one&#8208;time use and results in significant economic and environmental challenges. Reversible adhesives, based on covalent adaptable networks, address these issues and open possibilities for applications, including recyclable multi&#8208;layer packaging, removable labels, and fully recyclable electronics &#8211; batteries, smartphones, etc. Despite progress in dynamic and reversible bonds, current solutions often compromise performance or the ability to detach from substrates. This study proposes reversible high&#8208;performance adhesives that can undergo cycles of bonding&#8208;debonding without commonly reported need to add solvent, high&#8208;temperature processing or use deep&#8208;UV irradiation while maintaining adhesives' functionality and reducing environmental impact. The bonding is done by rapid photocuring, which occurs within 30 seconds&#160;under irradiation at a wide range of visible wavelengths (400&#8211;650&#160;nm) while achieving constant adhesion strength across diverse substrates, including underwater adhesion. De&#8208;bonding is achieved using a simple household microwave. Furthermore, the adhesive's transparency and high refractive index enable its use in various optical applications, whereas its robustness in wet conditions expands its potential for bioadaptive or underwater systems. This adhesive represents a significant step toward sustainable adhesives that seamlessly integrate high performance with circular&#8208;economy principles.

An electrocatalyst (HSCo/TiO2&#8208;x) for Li&#8208;S batteries is reported, featuring undercoordinated TiO2&#8208;x nanosheets anchoring high&#8208;spin Co atoms. The unpaired 3d electrons of Co promote orbital hybridization with polysulfides, enhancing conversion kinetics, suppressing shuttle effects, and improving cycling stability under practical conditions.








Abstract
The development of electrocatalysts to mitigate polysulfide shuttling and enhance the kinetics of sulfur species conversion is pivotal for the advancement of lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. In this study, the fabrication of porous, undercoordinated titanium dioxide nanosheets adorned with high&#8208;spin state cobalt atoms (HSCo/TiO2&#8208;x) as efficient electrocatalysts is presented. The undercoordinated TiO2&#8208;x nanosheets provide a profusion of edge active sites conducive to Co atom attachment, firmly embedded within the lattice structure, thereby ensuring heightened structural stability throughout repetitive cycling processes. Furthermore, the high&#8208;spin state Co atoms contribute abundant unpaired electrons, occupying distinct 3d orbitals. This configuration facilitates electron transfer and orbital hybridization upon interaction with polysulfides, leading to suppressed shutting effect and enhanced polysulfide conversion kinetics. Consequently, the Li&#8208;S cell equipped with an HSCo/TiO2&#8208;x modified separator exhibits an impressive capacity of 8.05 mAh cm&#8722;2 under elevated sulfur loading of 10.9 mg cm&#8722;2. Additionally, the fabricated Li&#8208;S pouch cell delivers a substantial initial discharge capacity of 0.47 Ah with a high energy density of 379.3 Wh kg&#8722;1. This study serves as a valuable reference for exploring the intricate relationship between spin state regulation and electrochemical performance, and holds great promise for the design of highly efficient future electrocatalysts.

         <title>Anisotropy Engineering for Constructing Gradient Electrodes with High&#8208;Efficiency Bi/C Catalyst In Situ for Iron&#8208;Chromium Flow Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work found the current density anisotropy at the negative electrode in the ICFB by multi&#8208;physical field simulation. Therefore, a strategy of anisotropy engineering for constructing gradient electrodes is carried out successfully. A high&#8208;efficiency carbon&#8208;loaded bismuth catalyst is fabricated and introduced on the electrode in situ with the assistance of PVP.








Abstract
Iron&#8208;chromium flow batteries (ICFBs) are regarded as one of the most potential large&#8208;scale energy storage devices. Nevertheless, the slow dynamics of the Cr3+/Cr2+ redox couples hinder the development of ICFBs. Here, a high&#8208;efficiency carbon&#8208;loaded bismuth (Bi/C) catalyst is fabricated and introduced on the electrode in situ to improve the dynamics with the assistance of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). To derive the greatest value, we explore the current density anisotropy in ICFB and design a strategy of anisotropy engineering to meet the requirements of the anisotropy for catalysts.

     alt="Anisotropy Engineering for Constructing Gradient Electrodes with High-Efficiency Bi/C Catalyst In Situ for Iron-Chromium Flow Battery"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work found the current density anisotropy at the negative electrode in the ICFB by multi-physical field simulation. Therefore, a strategy of anisotropy engineering for constructing gradient electrodes is carried out successfully. A high-efficiency carbon-loaded bismuth catalyst is fabricated and introduced on the electrode in situ with the assistance of PVP.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron-chromium flow batteries (ICFBs) are regarded as one of the most potential large-scale energy storage devices. Nevertheless, the slow dynamics of the Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;/Cr&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; redox couples hinder the development of ICFBs. Here, a high-efficiency carbon-loaded bismuth (Bi/C) catalyst is fabricated and introduced on the electrode in situ to improve the dynamics with the assistance of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). To derive the greatest value, we explore the current density anisotropy in ICFB and design a strategy of anisotropy engineering to meet the requirements of the anisotropy for catalysts. In the work, the gradient electrode (G-PBiC/TCF) with a high-efficiency Bi/C catalyst is successfully prepared. In addition, the ICFB assembled with the G-PBiC/TCF(M/m, the side of more catalysts facing the Membrane side) shows excellent battery performance. It can run over 500 cycles with EE of 81.36% at 120 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is the longest cycle life reported. Furthermore, the catalytic mechanism and the effect of the catalyst distribution on the performance are explained by the DFT calculation and multi-physical field simulation. This work provides a novel pathway to design that catalyst-supported gradient electrode with high performance and low cost.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Traceless Photopolymerization with Non&#8208;Pulsed Red Light Enables 3D&#8208;Printable Cell&#8208;Laden Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The paper presents a red&#8208;light&#8208;induced polymerization process, initiated by the FDA&#8208;approved dye methylene blue and the cytocompatible co&#8208;initiator triethanolamine, for fabricating hydrogels. This photopolymerization process is oxygen&#8208;tolerant, cytocompatible, and, most importantly, leaves no color traces, resulting in completely transparent scaffolds. The photoinitiating system is successfully applied for extrusion&#8208;based 3D (bio)printing of cell&#8208;laden hydrogels.








Abstract
Photocrosslinking of hydrogels with non&#8208;pulsed red light offers improved biocompatibility and deep tissue penetration in contrast to traditional UV&#8208;initiated methods. However, hydrogels fabricated upon red&#8208;light excitation are always colored by a photoinitiator, limiting their use in applications requiring high optical transparency, such as (bio)sensors, ophthalmological applications, or wound dressings. Additionally, the cytotoxicity of a photoinitiator is always a concern, especially in bioapplications. Herein, a photoinitiating system composed of an FDA&#8208;approved methylene blue photosensitizer and cytocompatible triethanolamine is introduced. The system can induce photopolymerization upon 625 nm irradiation and leaves no visible trace of the methylene blue color afterward, thus named &#8220;traceless&#8221;. With this approach, gelatine methacrylate hydrogel is successfully polymerized under ambient conditions. The hydrogel is permanently colorless with well&#8208;controlled stiffness due to the light&#8208;dependent nature of the polymerization process. The system is further successfully applied in extrusion&#8208;based 3D&#8208;bioprinting with NIH&#8208;3T3 fibroblasts, followed by photocuring to produce cell&#8208;laden 3D structures, indicating its potential for tissue engineering. Upon culturing the cell&#8208;laden constructs, the fibroblasts are able to proliferate and adhere to the hydrogel material. The red&#8208;light excitation enables polymerization through at least 5&#160;mm of biological tissue, projecting, inter alia, its use for transdermal photopolymerization in minimally invasive implantation.

         <title>Tailoring Protein Adsorption at the Solid&#8211;Liquid Interface for Long&#8208;Term Superhemophobicity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional superhydrophobic surfaces struggle to repel blood long&#8208;term due to protein adsorption, disrupting the Cassie&#8211;Baxter state. Inspired by Salvinia, a heterogeneous superhemophobic surface is engineered by integrating protein&#8208;resistant hydrophilic molecules, significantly extending blood&#8208;repellency time&#8212;over 10 times longer than conventional superhydrophobic surfaces&#8212;thus maintaining robust superhemophobicity.








Abstract
Super&#8208;repellent surfaces with micro/nanoscale roughness can sustain blood in the Cassie&#8211;Baxter state and minimize the solid&#8211;liquid contact area, exhibiting potential for biomedical applications. Conventional superhydrophobic surfaces with hydrophobic solid&#8211;liquid interface are susceptible to protein adsorption under blood flow, leading to a transition to the Wenzel state and increasing the risk of thrombosis. Inspired by Salvinia, hydrophilic molecules are incorporated at the solid&#8211;liquid contact area based on the interaction between blood and the surface topography as well as chemistry, thereby engineering a chemically heterogeneous superhemophobic surface which effectively prevents protein adsorption and maintains a long&#8208;term Cassie&#8211;Baxter state. The blood&#8208;repellent time of the heterogeneous surface is greater than tenfold those of conventional superhydrophobic surfaces. In vivo rabbit blood circulation confirms sustained hemocompatibility and effective thrombosis resistance, demonstrating prolonged superhemophobicity for over 55&#160;h. The heterogeneous design ensures extended resistance to complex biological fluids and is promising for the development of blood&#8208;contacting devices, such as the gas&#8208;permeable blood&#8208;repellent membranes for extracorporeal membrane oxygenators.

         <title>Optogenetics&#8208;Inspired Nanofluidic Artificial Dendrite with Spatiotemporal Integration Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The optical&#8208;controlled nanofluidic artificial dendrite is demonstrated by embedding layered graphene oxide within polydimethylsiloxane elastomer. The dendritic spatial and temporal integrations are reproduced by applying light spike at different position and with varying temporal sequences, respectively. The hand withdrawal reflex neuromorphic system is demonstrated, which integrates pain sensing and brain controlling information for modulating&#160;different withdrawal state of mechanical arm.








Abstract
Dendrites play an essential role in processing functions by facilitating the integration of spatial and temporal information in biological system. Nanofluidic memristors, which harness ions for signal transmission within electrolyte solutions, closely resemble biological neuronal ion channels and hold the potential for the development of biorealistic neuromorphic devices. Herein, inspired by the optogenetic technique that utilized light to tune the ions dynamic, an optical&#8208;controlled nanofluidic artificial dendrite by embedding layered graphene oxide (GO) within a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer is developed. Taking advantage of the confinement effect of ions in the nanochannel, it has demonstrated optically&#8208;modulated ionic currents, which can effectively replicate dendritic functions. The mechanism can be attributed to the migration of Na+ ions, driven by the electric potential difference light illumination. The dendritic spatial and temporal multiport integrations are realized, including the dendritic sublinear/superlinear integrations and spike&#8208;rate&#8208;dependent plasticity (SRDP). Moreover, the hand withdrawal reflex, as a crucial mode of neuroregulation governed by central nerve and brain control signals, is replicated in the nanofluidic dendrite&#8208;based neuromorphic system, capable of managing a range of withdrawal states of a mechanical arm. This work offers a new strategy for developing nanofluidic artificial dendrite and paves the way toward developing advanced neuromorphic sensorimotor systems.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Blue Narrowband OLEDs Achieve External Quantum Efficiency Over 40% and Blue Index of 422 by Synergistic &#960;&#8208;Extension and Heavy&#8208;Atom Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#960;&#8208;extended, heavy&#8208;atom design enables multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters with an ultrafast reverse intersystem crossing rate of 3.0 &#215; 106 s&#8722;1 while preserving narrowband emission in the deep&#8208;blue region. The best&#8208;performing device achieves an emission maximum at 456 nm, a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 18 nm, a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 40.5%, and a Blue Index of 422, charting a promising route toward next&#8208;generation deep&#8208;blue display technologies.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters hold great promise for high&#8208;resolution OLEDs, yet achieving both ultranarrow emission and efficient triplet utilization in the deep&#8208;blue region remains challenging. Here, a synergistic molecular design is reported that combines &#960;&#8208;extension and heavy&#8208;atom incorporation to effectively reconcile the trade&#8208;off between color purity and fast reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). In this approach, &#960;&#8208;extension narrows the emission bandwidth and reduces the singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap, while the strategic introduction of chalcogen atoms selectively enhances spin&#8211;orbit coupling with minimal impact on the emission spectrum. As a result, the new emitter exhibits a peak emission at 453&#160;nm with an exceptionally narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 17&#160;nm and a high RISC rate constant of 3.0 &#215; 106&#8201;s&#8722;1. When incorporated into a non&#8208;sensitized OLED, the emitter meets the European Broadcast Union (EBU) deep&#8208;blue standard with CIE coordinates as low as (0.140,&#8201;0.059), and sustains a brightness exceeding 30,000&#8201;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. Notably, the device achieves a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 40.5% with minimal roll&#8208;off&#8212;retaining 38.4% and 28.2% at 100 and 1,000&#160;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, respectively&#8212;and attains a Blue Index (BI) of 422&#160;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1&#8201;CIEy&#8722;1. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our tactic in overcoming prior limitations where heavy&#8208;atom doping often compromises color purity, paving the way for next&#8208;generation emitters in advanced display and lighting applications.

     alt="Deep-Blue Narrowband OLEDs Achieve External Quantum Efficiency Over 40% and Blue Index of 422 by Synergistic &#960;-Extension and Heavy-Atom Effect"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &#960;-extended, heavy-atom design enables multi-resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters with an ultrafast reverse intersystem crossing rate of 3.0 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; while preserving narrowband emission in the deep-blue region. The best-performing device achieves an emission maximum at 456 nm, a full-width at half-maximum of 18 nm, a record-high external quantum efficiency of 40.5%, and a Blue Index of 422, charting a promising route toward next-generation deep-blue display technologies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multi-resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR-TADF) emitters hold great promise for high-resolution OLEDs, yet achieving both ultranarrow emission and efficient triplet utilization in the deep-blue region remains challenging. Here, a synergistic molecular design is reported that combines &#960;-extension and heavy-atom incorporation to effectively reconcile the trade-off between color purity and fast reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). In this approach, &#960;-extension narrows the emission bandwidth and reduces the singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap, while the strategic introduction of chalcogen atoms selectively enhances spin&#8211;orbit coupling with minimal impact on the emission spectrum. As a result, the new emitter exhibits a peak emission at 453&#160;nm with an exceptionally narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 17&#160;nm and a high RISC rate constant of 3.0 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. When incorporated into a non-sensitized OLED, the emitter meets the European Broadcast Union (EBU) deep-blue standard with CIE coordinates as low as (0.140,&#8201;0.059), and sustains a brightness exceeding 30,000&#8201;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Notably, the device achieves a record-high external quantum efficiency (EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) of 40.5% with minimal roll-off&#8212;retaining 38.4% and 28.2% at 100 and 1,000&#160;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively&#8212;and attains a Blue Index (BI) of 422&#160;cd&#8201;A&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;CIE&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our tactic in overcoming prior limitations where heavy-atom doping often compromises color purity, paving the way for next-generation emitters in advanced display and lighting applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spatiotemporal Targeted Delivery of Biomimetic Bacterial Outer Membrane Nanoparticles for Enhanced Spinal Cord Injury Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
BM&#8208;NPs provide a dynamic and spatiotemporally targeted solution for post&#8208;spinal cord injury challenges. By mitigating foam cell formation, regulating inflammation, enhancing autophagy, and promoting cholesterol efflux, BM&#8208;NPs effectively preserve myelin integrity, reshape the inflammatory microenvironment, and facilitate neural function recovery. This versatile platform offers innovative potential for addressing the complexities of spinal cord injury treatment.








Abstract
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a complex and dynamic pathological condition characterized by disrupted lipid metabolism and neuroinflammatory responses, posing significant therapeutic challenges. To address these, biomimetic bacterial outer membrane nanoparticles (BM&#8208;NPs) are designed by integrating the precise targeting capability of detoxified outer membrane vesicles (dOMVs) with the efficient drug&#8208;loading properties of liposomes. BM&#8208;NPs exhibit superior targeting efficiency toward peripheral neutrophils and macrophages, enabling spatiotemporal drug delivery via immune cells. An innovative &#8220;Tortoise and Hare&#8221; dynamic adaptive delivery strategy is introduced, where neutrophils facilitate rapid drug transport during the acute phase of SCI, while macrophages ensure sustained delivery during the subacute phase. This strategy aligns with the dynamic pathological progression of SCI, offering precision targeting tailored to different stages of injury. BM&#8208;NPs demonstrate multifaceted therapeutic effects, including the suppression of foam cell formation through coordinated enhancement of lipid droplet autophagy and cholesterol efflux. Furthermore, they modulate the inflammatory microenvironment, preserve myelin integrity, and significantly promote neural functional recovery post&#8208;SCI. By overcoming the limitations of conventional delivery systems in targeting and timeliness, BM&#8208;NPs offer an innovative, highly efficient, and clinically translatable platform for SCI treatment and other acute inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system.

         <title>Structurally Colored Sustainable Sea Silk from Atrina pectinata</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research, highlighting i) the hierarchical assembly of Photonins, ii) the sugar&#8211;lectin binding which modulates structural stability and mechanical properties of sea silk, and iii) the use of golden sea silk as a photonic protein fiber.








Abstract
The harvesting of sea silk, a luxurious golden textile traditionally obtained from the endangered mollusk Pinna nobilis, faces severe limitations due to conservation efforts, driving the search for sustainable alternatives. Atrina pectinata, a phylogenetically close relative within the Pinnidae family is identified, as a viable source of biomimetic sea silk. The byssal threads of A. pectinata can be processed using existing methods, providing a way to continue producing this historically significant textile. These threads exhibit a remarkable hierarchical structure with globular proteins organized across multiple scales and stabilized by supramolecular sugar&#8208;lectin interactions that influence their mechanical properties. Moreover, the threads display a brilliant golden hue arising from structural coloration, ensuring exceptional lightfastness, retaining their color for millennia. This discovery elucidates the biomolecular foundations of sea silk's unique properties and establishes A. pectinata as a sustainable candidate for producing exquisite golden textiles and bioinspired pigments, thereby addressing the growing demand for eco&#8208;friendly and long&#8208;lasting colored materials in the textile and pigment industries.

         <title>Engineering Organic Photochromism with Photoactivated Phosphorescence: Multifunctional Smart Devices and Enhanced Four&#8208;Channel Data Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By engineering the interactions between the photochromic and phosphorescent components through covalent linking, the multifunctional device significantly enhances data storage density. Based on a pure organic film, the device exhibits exceptional flexibility and multifunctionality, enabling remote monitoring of acid gases and blue light radiation as well as the automatic control of blue light exposure.








Abstract
The development of organic photoresponsive materials with multiple responses is essential for advancing multichannel data storage systems. In this study, interactions between photochromic and phosphorescent components are engineered by covalently linking them to obtain NMC&#160;(the compound containing naphthalimide and merocyanine units), which converted into NSP (the compound containing naphthalimide and spiropyran units) upon blue light irradiation, resulting in a maximum decrease in absorption of more than 90%, a blueshift of the fluorescent emission peaks from 605 to 490&#160;nm, and an 84 fold enhancement in phosphorescence emission intensity. These significant optical changes across the three modes upon exposure to blue light are unprecedented. The conversion of optical signals to electrical signals enables the successful implementation of devices for remote monitoring of acid gas and blue light, as well as automatic control of blue light exposure. Furthermore, the data storage capacity of the device is significantly enhanced, increasing from 1 bit to log2(4n) bits per point in a four&#8208;channel data storage system. The design and synthesis of this compound present a promising approach for the development of sustainable, efficient, and flexible smart optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Hierarchical Engineering of Amphiphilic Peptides Nanofibrous Crosslinkers toward Mechanically Robust, Functionally Customable, and Sustainable Supramolecular Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic hierarchical engineering approach is reported for constructing mechanically robust yet structurally dynamic hydrogels through the integration of amphiphilic peptide nanofibers as multifunctional supramolecular crosslinkers. The synergistic combination of molecular amphiphilicity and sequence&#8208;programmable design enables precise customization of hydrogel functionality, while the fully dynamic supramolecular network facilitates efficient material recycling and reprocessing for sustainable environmental practices.








Abstract
Hierarchical architectures spanning multiple length scales are ubiquitous in biological tissues, conferring them with both mechanical robustness and dynamic functionalities via structural reorganization under loads. The design of hierarchical architectures within synthetic hydrogels to concurrently achieve mechanical reinforcement and functional integration remains challenging. Here, a biomimetic hierarchical engineering approach is reported to develop mechanically robust and function&#8208;customizable supramolecular hydrogels by utilizing strong yet dynamic fibrous nanoarchitectures of amphiphilic peptides as crosslinkers. This design, on one hand, resolves the strength&#8208;toughness trade&#8208;off in hydrogel design through energy&#8208;dissipative mechanisms involving dynamic detachment and reinsertion of peptides within their assembled nanostructures upon loading. On the other hand, the amphiphilicity and sequence programmability of peptides allow spatially orthogonal integration of multiple dynamic functionalities across distinct structural domains, including lipophilic fluorophore encapsulation, photopatterning capability, and anisotropic contraction. Capitalizing on its ultralow hysteresis and rapid recovery properties, the hydrogel's effectiveness is demonstrated as high&#8208;sensitivity strain sensors. Moreover, the fully noncovalent crosslinking strategy permits closed&#8208;loop recycling and reprocessing via reversible crosslinker disassembly&#8208;reassembly processes. Through systematic extension of this principle across diverse peptide systems, a generalized platform is demonstrated for creating advanced soft materials that synergistically integrate traditionally incompatible attributes of mechanical robustness, customable dynamic functionality, and environmental sustainability.

         <title>Programmable Wire Metamaterials for Visible and Self&#8208;Adaptive Infrared Camouflage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmable metamaterial&#8208;based camouflage system is developed to seamlessly blend objects into their surroundings, not only hiding them from the human eye but also automatically adapting to thermal environments without human intervention. It provides effective concealment throughout day and night cycles, across diverse terrains like deserts, forests, and roads. This innovative approach advances diverse self&#8208;adaptive materials design.








Abstract
Adaptive infrared (IR) radiation management that can autonomously adjust IR radiation on demand while maintaining independent visible compatibility has been long pursued for practical applications, such as camouflage. Here, an integrated programmable wire metamaterial is developed that enables programmable autonomy and dual&#8208;band compatibility for non&#8208;interference visible and self&#8208;adaptive IR camouflage. This system allows automatic and intelligent concealment of targets in complex and dynamic thermal environments without human intervention. The self&#8208;adaptive IR camouflage is facilitated by the manipulation of the metamaterial's tilt angle for continuous tunability of emissivity, which is attributed to the tilt angle&#8208;dependent broadband impedance matching mechanisms. Equipped with programmable feedback algorithm commands, the integrated system dynamically adapts to varying thermal backgrounds, achieving apparent temperature modulation of up to 27&#160;&#176;C (ranging from 14 to 41&#160;&#176;C) while minimizing thermal imaging contrast to within 1&#160;&#176;C. These capabilities ensure that the target remains undetected by both visible and thermal detectors throughout the day. This work opens up new opportunities for the next&#8208;generation multispectral camouflage technologies and advances in spatiotemporal and programmable self&#8208;adaptive systems.

         <title>Inorganic Hydrogels can be Flexible and Highly Extensible</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional inorganic hydrogels are usually rigid or fragile, which limits their applications. By crosslinking long&#8208;chain polyphosphate (LPP) with M2+ ions (Ni2+, etc.), flexible and extensible inorganic polymer hydrogels can be obtained. It is found that the Ni&#8208;LPP hydrogel is highly extensible, conductive, self&#8208;healing, and arbitrarily shapeable. The Ni2+&#8208;phosphate motif can be applied to other hydrogels as an extension enhancement factor.









Abstract
Inorganic hydrogels have great potential in many applications as sustainable materials, but lack flexibility due to rigid network structures. Here, a novel strategy is proposed&#8212;an inorganic polymer hydrogel, prepared by crosslinking long&#8208;chain polyphosphate (LPP) with M2+ ions (Ca2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, Ni2+), which effectively address the rigidity and fragility issues commonly associated with traditional inorganic gels. With the most stable hydration shell among those ions, Ni2+ tends to interact indirectly with LPP through hydrogen bonds rather than coordination bonds. The unique Ni2+&#8208;phosphate interaction endows the Ni&#8208;LPP hydrogels with ultrahigh elongation at break (&#8776;15&#8201;000&#215;). Further experiments reveal that the Ni2+&#8208;phosphate motif can be applied to other hydrogels as an extension enhancement factor. The highly extensible, good conductive (1.06 &#177; 0.08 S m&#8722;1), self&#8208;healing (within 30 s and without stimulation), arbitrarily shapeable, and nonflammable Ni&#8208;LPP inorganic hydrogel indicates a bright future in flexible electronics, environmental remediation, and beyond.

         <title>Versatile Superlubricity via Boronizing on Engineering Alloys: Insights into In Situ Passivation Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust and versatile solid&#8211;liquid superlubricity strategy for engineering alloys is achieved via the synergistic chemical of surface boronization and polyols lubricant. Experiments and MD simulations indicate that weak interactions between the polyol lubricant and the in situ generated &#8211;CxHy passivation layer minimize friction and heat dissipation. Experiments on OTS&#8208;modified surfaces further highlight the critical role of surface passivation in achieving superlubricity, and a &#8216;Passivation Driven SuperLubricity&#8217; (PDSL) design principle is proposed to describe this mechanism.








Abstract
Superlubricity with a friction coefficient &lt;0.01 holds great promise for reducing energy consumption and global CO2 emissions. However, current numerous innovative superlubricity techniques have persisted in specific materials, inert atmosphere or nano/micro&#8208;scale conditions. Here, a versatile and universal superlubricity strategy is demonstrated for common engineering alloys under atmospheric environment, and emphasize an innovative superlubricity design principle through surface passivation. Such superlubricity behavior is achieved by employing electrochemical boronizing surface treatment combined with liquid polyol/water mixture lubricants, revealing significant advances in terms of wide adaptability to traditional and newly&#8208;emerged alloy materials, high load capacity and high&#8208;temperature resistance (&#8776;125&#160;&#176;C). The atomistic simulations and experimental results demonstrate that the energy dissipation reduction and superlubricity are driven by the weak interaction between the confined lubricant molecules and &#9472;CxHy&#8208;terminated passivation tribofilm, which is in situ generated by the mechanochemical reaction between the boronized layer and the liquid lubricant. The role of passivation layer on driving superlubricity is further supported by the exceptionally super&#8208;low friction coefficient (COF&#8776;0.008) observed in octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) molecular layer coated surfaces. This advancement opens the door for developing industrial&#8208;scale superlubricity techniques and has the potential to accelerate their practical applications in engineering area.

         <title>Guideline of Dynamic Tunnel Structural Evolution for Durable Sodium&#8208;Ion Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tunnel&#8208;type Na0.44MnO2 cathode dynamically evolves into different crystal structures upon Mn substitution by other elements, a process that can be rationally regulated to achieve both high capacity and high stability. This study addresses a critical challenge in the development of sodium&#8208;ion oxide cathodes by elucidating the design principles governing their dynamic tunnel structural evolution.








Abstract
Mn&#8208;based oxide cathodes hold great promise for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to their cost&#8208;effectiveness and environmental compatibility. In this study, using tunnel&#8208;type Na0.44MnO2 as a prototype, a systematic investigation is conducted to examine how different element substitutions affect structural evolution and found that these element substitutions alter the total energy of the pristine system, driving the structure to evolve gradually from a tunnel to a different crystal configuration. Notably, using advanced scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), the transition zone is captured from tunnel to layered structure for the first time, providing direct evidence of phase evolution. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Mg substitution uniquely facilitates the formation of layered/spinel heterostructures, enabling intimate interfacial integration that reduces Na&#8314; transport barriers and enhances structural integrity. COMSOL simulations further demonstrate that the layered/spinel configuration effectively mitigates stress accumulation, achieving high rate and long cycle performance. These findings provide comprehensive design principles of dynamic tunnel structural evolution of Mn&#8208;based oxide cathodes, thereby advancing the design of high&#8208;performance SIBs.

Abstract
Macrocycle&#8208;based adaptive crystals have gained significant attention for their precise adsorption and separation capabilities. However, achieving controlled analyte release under nonthermal stimuli remains a major challenge. Here, a relay&#8208;type solid&#8208;state host&#8211;guest system based on a fluorinated pillararene derivative, EtFLP6, is presented, which enables selective adsorption of 1&#8208;/2&#8208;bromoalkane isomers, room&#8208;temperature&#8208;controlled desorption, and turn&#8208;on colorimetric sensing. Activated EtFLP6 crystals selectively adsorb 1&#8208;bromoalkanes from mixtures of 1&#8208;/2&#8208;positional isomers and release them at room temperature upon introduction of electron&#8208;deficient aromatic acceptors (4&#8208;nitrobenzonitrile and 1,5&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2,4&#8208;dinitrobenzene), triggering a distinct color change from colorless to orange. Single&#8208;crystal structures incorporating X&#8208;ray powder diffraction and spectral analyses reveal that the desorption and color change result from the disassembly of solid&#8208;state host&#8211;guest complexes, driven by competitive binding with acceptors. This process is governed by the dynamic intermolecular interactions and selective molecular recognition of EtFLP6 in the solid state. This work bridges traditional macrocyclic adsorbents with functional organic cocrystals, offering a novel strategy for designing intelligent supramolecular materials.

&lt;p&gt;A macrocycle-based multifunctional solid-state host&#8211;guest system is constructed for selective adsorption and separation of 1-/2-bromoalkane isomers, controlled release at room temperature, and colorimetric sensing. Utilizing a competitive binding strategy, the system enables dynamic guest exchange and donor&#8211;acceptor assembly, offering new insights into stimuli-responsive supramolecular crystalline materials and advanced molecular separation technologies.

         <title>CO2&#8208;Responsive Smart Wood Scaffold for Natural Organic Matter Removal without Secondary Pollution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CO2&#8208;responsive smart wood scaffold is developed for sustainable water purification, achieving efficient natural organic matter (NOM) removal and microbial disinfection without secondary pollution. The CO2&#8208;responsive polymer coating undergoes protonation upon CO2 exposure, enabling strong cation&#8722;&#960; interactions with NOM. This scalable and eco&#8208;friendly strategy provides a breakthrough solution for high&#8208;performance, chemical&#8208;free water treatment across diverse environmental conditions.








Abstract
Ensuring drinking water safety remains a critical challenge, particularly when treating complex water sources, due to secondary pollution caused by active chemical additives. Herein, a novel CO2&#8208;responsive smart wood scaffold that leverages non&#8208;toxic CO2 activation is developed to achieve highly efficient removal of carcinogenic natural organic matter (NOM) and broad&#8208;spectrum microbial disinfection without requiring additional chemical agents. Unlike conventional water purification techniques that face a safety&#8208;efficacy trade&#8208;off, the multi&#8208;stage CO2&#8208;responsive wood scaffold offers exceptional tunability in NOM abatement across diverse environmental conditions, including variable water chemistry, NOM composition, high salinity, and real&#8208;world water sources. The purified water meets stringent drinking water standards (e.g., UV254 reduction, dissolved organic carbon removal, and bacterial elimination). It is found that the highly efficient NOM adsorption mainly originates from the strong and stable CO2&#8208;triggered cation&#8722;&#960; interaction between the scaffold surface and aromatic NOM groups, as revealed via high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry and direct intermolecular force measurements. This ecofriendly and contamination&#8208;free CO2&#8208;responsive strategy provides a transformative approach to overcoming secondary pollution challenges in water purification, offering a scalable and sustainable platform for environmental applications and beyond.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Generational Frontal Curing and Chemical Recycling of Polydicyclopentadiene Thermosets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Frontal polymerization meets chemical recycling: repeated rapid frontal curing, deconstruction, and chemical regeneration of polydicyclopentadiene thermosets are enabled by a small amount of a cleavable additive, a &#8220;fuel&#8221; additive, and a one&#8208;pot deconstruction&#8208;functionalization method. High thermomechanical performance and recyclability are preserved across five life cycles, offering a scalable pathway toward sustainable high&#8208;performance thermoset materials.








Abstract
Polydicyclopentadiene (pDCPD) is a high&#8208;performance thermoset with lightweight and exceptional thermomechanical properties. However, its traditional thermal curing process is energy&#8208;intensive and lacks chemical recyclability. Frontal Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization (FROMP) is an energy&#8208;efficient curing process and allows additive manufacturing of pDCPD. 2,3&#8208;Dihydrofuran (DHF) has been shown as an effective comonomer to allow the deconstruction of pDCPD thermosets when incorporated at a small fraction in pDCPD. Herein, a simple strategy for chemical recycling of pDCPD thermosets is reported, and maintaining FROMP characteristics and thermomechanical properties of the thermosets over five life cycles. Norbornadiene (NBD) is a key additive in resins containing recycled pDCPD to enhance polymerization kinetics and sustain FROMP characteristics. A one&#8208;pot strategy is also developed to deconstruct pDCPD thermosets and simultaneously functionalize the chain ends with norbornenes for reincorporating deconstructed oligomers back to the next generation thermoset. Using these strategies, five generations of recycling pDCPD thermosets with invariable thermomechanical properties are demonstrated. This work highlights a scalable and energy&#8208;efficient process to produce chemically recyclable pDCPD thermosets, significantly improving the circularity of this class of high&#8208;performance thermosets.

         <title>Steering Yolk&#8211;Shell Nanostructures of 1D Unit&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks as Binder Modulators</title>

A kind of 1D unit&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks with yolk&#8211;shell nanomorphology is prepared via a solvent&#8208;induced strategy that can be applied as binder modulators for Li&#8208;S batteries.








Abstract
Induced by their weak chain interactions, 1D unit&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (1D COFs) are favorable in molecular assembly, yet their exploration in morphology engineering and related energy storage applications are still rare. Here, a series of 1D COFs based nano&#8208;structures (i.e. yolk&#8211;shell spheres (YS&#8208;COF), hollow spheres (HS&#8208;COF) and solid spheres (SS&#8208;COF)) is prepared via a solvent&#8208;induced strategy that can be applied as binder modulators for Li&#8208;S batteries. Specifically, they can impart enhanced mechanical properties, more adaptability to volume change, and better ability in adsorbing/catalyzing lithium polysulfide intermediates (LiPSs) to traditional PVDF binder. Remarkably, the thus&#8208;assembled YS&#8208;COF&#8208;based cell displays an initial specific capacity of up to 1011 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 C, which is much higher than that of HS&#8208;COF, SS&#8208;COF, and PVDF&#8208;based Li&#8208;S batteries. Even at 4 C, it still maintains a discharge specific capacity of 962 mAh g&#8722;1 and can cycle for &gt;600 cycles. DFT calculations and finite element simulation reveal the important roles of nanomorphology and functional groups of YS&#8208;COF in promoting electrochemical redox kinetics to boost battery performances. This strategy might provide in&#8208;depth insights in the morphology engineering and performance optimization of 1D COFs for Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Self&#8208;Trapped Excitons Activate Pseudo&#8208;Inert Basal Planes of 2D Organic Semiconductors for Improved Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D organic semiconductors are widely believed to have uniformly active surfaces. This study reveals that their basal planes can be pseudo&#8208;inert due to anisotropic exciton migration. By inducing exciton self&#8208;trapping through dimensional reduction, these inert planes are activated, boosting hydrogen peroxide production by over 350%. The work uncovers key structure&#8211;property relationships for advanced photocatalyst design.









Abstract
2D organic semiconductors are widely considered superior photocatalysts due to their large basal planes, which host abundant and tunable reaction sites. However, here, it is discovered that these basal planes can be pseudo&#8208;inert, fundamentally challenging conventional design strategies that assume uniform activity on the surface of 2D organic semiconductors. Using 2D potassium&#8208;poly (heptazine imide) (KPHI) for hydrogen peroxide photocatalysis as a model, it is demonstrated that the pseudo&#8208;inertness of basal planes stems from preferential exciton transport to edges, instead of interlayer transport in highly ordered structures. Thus, their dimension reduction enables controlled localization of exciton due to the self&#8208;trapping mechanism, whereby the basal planes can transform from pseudo&#8208;inert state into active catalytic sites. With this knowledge, a modified 2D KPHI capable of generating 35 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 of H2O2, which is over 350% increase compared to pristine KPHI, is reported. More interestingly, the activated basal planes promote H2O2 production through a reaction pathway distinct from that of pseudo&#8208;inert basal planes. These findings establish fundamental principles connecting crystal structure, exciton dynamics, and reactive site distribution, providing new insights into the design of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts.

By inducing exciton self-trapping through dimensional reduction, these inert planes are activated, boosting hydrogen peroxide production by over 350%. The work uncovers key structure&#8211;property relationships for advanced photocatalyst design.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D organic semiconductors are widely considered superior photocatalysts due to their large basal planes, which host abundant and tunable reaction sites. However, here, it is discovered that these basal planes can be pseudo-inert, fundamentally challenging conventional design strategies that assume uniform activity on the surface of 2D organic semiconductors. Using 2D potassium-poly (heptazine imide) (KPHI) for hydrogen peroxide photocatalysis as a model, it is demonstrated that the pseudo-inertness of basal planes stems from preferential exciton transport to edges, instead of interlayer transport in highly ordered structures. Thus, their dimension reduction enables controlled localization of exciton due to the self-trapping mechanism, whereby the basal planes can transform from pseudo-inert state into active catalytic sites. With this knowledge, a modified 2D KPHI capable of generating 35 mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is over 350% increase compared to pristine KPHI, is reported. More interestingly, the activated basal planes promote H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production through a reaction pathway distinct from that of pseudo-inert basal planes. These findings establish fundamental principles connecting crystal structure, exciton dynamics, and reactive site distribution, providing new insights into the design of high-performance photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Topology fortified anode (TFA) materials, featuring a 3D lithiophilic Li5B4 skeleton combined with an ingeniously optimized fraction of electroactive lithium phase, along with broadened external pressure tolerance to enhance the electrochemical performance of ASSLBs. The TFA materials exhibit robust mechanical stability and fast lithium diffusivity, achieving near&#8208;zero volume changes along with a fivefold improvement in external pressure tolerance compared to Li&#176;.








Abstract
Despite its high theoretical capacity and the lowest electrode potential, the lithium metal (Li&#176;) anode possesses significant volume changes and narrow external pressure tolerance upon cycling, hindering its commercial applications in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). Herein, the concept of topology fortified anode (TFA) materials is introduced, featuring a 3D lithiophilic Li5B4 skeleton combined with an ingeniously optimized fraction of electroactive lithium phase, along with broadened external pressure tolerance to synergistically enhance the electrochemical performance of ASSLBs. The unique topological design of the TFA materials empowers them with robust mechanical stability and fast lithium diffusivity, achieving near&#8208;zero volume changes along with a fivefold improvement in external pressure tolerance compared to Li&#176;. An archetypal TFA&#8208;based symmetric cell demonstrates 3.6&#8208;fold higher critical current density than its Li&#176;&#8208;based counterpart, sustaining stable cycling for &gt;6,000&#160;h at 2 mAh cm&#8722;2. When paired with a high&#8208;capacity of FeS2 cathode, the archetypal TFA&#8208;based full cells achieve 62% active lithium utilization (9.5 mAh cm&#8722;2), and &#8776;70% capacity retention after 800 cycles at a high current density of 3.07 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The findings provide a revolutionary design approach for high&#8208;energy anodes in ASSLBs, advancing not only their development but also battery technologies beyond lithium chemistry.

         <title>Interface Engineering p&#8208;n Heterostructured Core&#8211;Shell Mesoporous Particles for Cascade Catalysis Promoted Gas Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by enzyme cascade catalysis and architectural features of living cells, a single&#8208;particle core&#8211;shell cascade catalysis promoted gas sensing platform is delicately designed by positionally assembling n&#8208;type mesoporous CeO2 catalytic shell on p&#8208;type nanocubic CoSnO3 sensitive core, which exhibits a superior sensing performance toward acetone due to the unique catalytic reforming&#8208;oxidation sensing behavior of the well&#8208;engineered CoSnO3@CeO2 heteroconfiguration.








Abstract
Cells have greatly inspired advancements in chemical processes, including leveraging the idea of cascade catalysis to drive thermodynamically unfavorable reactions and mimicking the compartmentalized architecture to design novel nanostructures. Here, a single&#8208;particle cascade catalysis promoted gas sensing platform is inspired to be designed (denoted as CoSnO3@mCeO2) by positionally assembling n&#8208;type mesoporous CeO2 catalytic shell on p&#8208;type CoSnO3 gas sensitive core. Uniform CoSn(OH)6@mCe(OH)x core&#8211;shell particles with tailored mesostructures, tunable large mesopores, and adjustable shell thicknesses are first constructed. After thermal treatment, CoSnO3@mCeO2 particles are obtained, which serve as cascade catalysis enhanced sensitive layer for fabricating gas sensors with independent catalytic and sensing control. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the CoSnO3@mCeO2 gas sensors exhibit nearly three times higher acetone sensitivity (Rg/Ra = 26.81&#8211;50&#160;ppm) than individual CoSnO3 sensors with an ultralow limit of detection of 5.22 ppb. The enhanced sensitivity is achieved through a tandem catalytic reforming&#8208;oxidation sensing procedure, which begins with the primary catalytic reforming of acetone to acetic acid in the mCeO2 shell, followed by the secondary sensing reaction of acetic acid in the CoSnO3 core. The design concept of cascade catalysis promotes gas sensor can serve as a paradigm for developing single&#8208;particle functional nanodevices for various applications.

         <title>A Smart DNA Nanoframework Enables Synergistic Photodynamic Therapy of Pancreatic Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart DNA nanoframework is constructed by precipitation polymerization and hybridization chain reaction, which enables the controlled co&#8208;delivery of Cas9 ribonucleoprotein, hemin, and Ce6 for synergistic PDT. The integrated functions of gene editing and PDT allow the substantial accumulation of 1O2 in cancer cells for enhanced cell apoptosis and inhibit tumor growth in a pancreatic cancer mouse model.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) holds great promise for treating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), one of the most lethal cancers, but its clinical application is hindered by limited generation and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to tumor hypoxia and the organism's antioxidant defense mechanisms. To address this challenge, a smart DNA nanoframework capable of controlled co&#8208;delivery of Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP), hemin, and chlorin e6 (Ce6) to enable synergistic PDT for PDAC is developed. This nanoframework employs a hybridization chain reaction and phase transition to achieve high payload loading capacity while overcoming steric hindrance. The G&#8208;quadruplex/hemin complex mimics horseradish peroxidase activity to convert endogenous H2O2 to O2, alleviating tumor hypoxia. Additionally, Cas9 RNP targets the nuclear factor E2&#8208;related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway, downregulating Nrf2 expression and diminishing the antioxidant response, thereby enhancing ROS accumulation. The synergistic effect of O&#8322; generation and Nrf2 suppression significantly enhances ROS&#8208;induced apoptosis in PDAC cells. In vitro, the system demonstrates efficient gene editing and robust downregulation of Nrf2, while in vivo studies in a PDAC mouse model reveal remarkable antitumor efficacy. This smart DNA nanoframework represents a promising strategy for enhancing PDT through precise genetic and biochemical modulation.

         <title>Synergistic Genetic and Chemical Engineering of Probiotics for Enhanced Intestinal Microbiota Regulation and Ulcerative Colitis Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel concept, &#8220;precise regulation of intestinal flora,&#8221; is introduced, integrating genetic and chemical engineering methods to transform probiotics for targeted modulation and effective treatment of UC. This approach, combining engineered bacteria with a polyelectrolyte coating, improves oral bioavailability, inflammation modulation, and flora regulation, offering a safer, more effective treatment option.








Abstract
Live bacterial therapeutics (LBT) hold significant promise for treating ulcerative colitis (UC) by utilizing engineered microorganisms to restore mucosal barrier function, modulate microbiota imbalances, and enhance immunity. However, challenges such as low bacterial survival under harsh gastrointestinal conditions, difficulties in achieving long&#8208;term colonization, and unclear therapeutic targets limit their effectiveness. To address these issues, a novel approach is proposed that integrates genetic and chemical engineering for intestinal flora regulation in UC treatment. This strategy employs bacterial programmability and gene editing to produce bactericidal agents that dynamically modulate the intestinal microecology and utilize controlled chemical modifications to enhance bacterial resistance. Using Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) as a model, a polyelectrolyte composite coating is developed that significantly increased bacterial survival in the gastrointestinal tract&#8212;40&#8208;fold in the stomach and 74&#8208;fold in the small intestine. Additionally, EcN::mcmA is engineered to overproduce iron&#8208;carrier microcins (MccM) with a &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; mechanism to target and disrupt pathogenic bacteria. In a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)&#8208;induced mouse UC model, EcN::mcmA@P/O treatment effectively reduced inflammation and improved intestinal flora regulation, presenting a promising and potentially safer long&#8208;term solution for UC.

&lt;p&gt;A novel concept, &#8220;precise regulation of intestinal flora,&#8221; is introduced, integrating genetic and chemical engineering methods to transform probiotics for targeted modulation and effective treatment of UC. This approach, combining engineered bacteria with a polyelectrolyte coating, improves oral bioavailability, inflammation modulation, and flora regulation, offering a safer, more effective treatment option.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live bacterial therapeutics (LBT) hold significant promise for treating ulcerative colitis (UC) by utilizing engineered microorganisms to restore mucosal barrier function, modulate microbiota imbalances, and enhance immunity. However, challenges such as low bacterial survival under harsh gastrointestinal conditions, difficulties in achieving long-term colonization, and unclear therapeutic targets limit their effectiveness. To address these issues, a novel approach is proposed that integrates genetic and chemical engineering for intestinal flora regulation in UC treatment. This strategy employs bacterial programmability and gene editing to produce bactericidal agents that dynamically modulate the intestinal microecology and utilize controlled chemical modifications to enhance bacterial resistance. Using &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; Nissle 1917 (EcN) as a model, a polyelectrolyte composite coating is developed that significantly increased bacterial survival in the gastrointestinal tract&#8212;40-fold in the stomach and 74-fold in the small intestine. Additionally, EcN::mcmA is engineered to overproduce iron-carrier microcins (MccM) with a &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; mechanism to target and disrupt pathogenic bacteria. In a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced mouse UC model, EcN::mcmA@P/O treatment effectively reduced inflammation and improved intestinal flora regulation, presenting a promising and potentially safer long-term solution for UC.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photosensitive Biomimetic Nanomedicine&#8208;Mediated Recombination of Adipose Microenvironments for Antiobesity Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a novel dual&#8208;targeted photosensitive biomimetic nanodelivery system is developed to accurately deliver astaxanthin and rosiglitazone to inflamed regions of the WAT, where it can correct lipid metabolism disorders while facilitating the reprogramming of M1&#8208;like macrophages for dual regulatory functions.








Abstract
Obesity&#8208;induced insulin resistance is a hallmark of metabolic syndrome, and chronic low&#8208;grade inflammation links obesity to insulin resistance through the activation of tissue&#8208;infiltrating immune cells. Current treatments are lacking in efficacy and immunosuppression. Therefore, novel therapies are needed to prevent chronic inflammation and alleviate obesity&#8208;related insulin resistance. In this work, novel red light&#8208;responsive biomimetic nanoparticles (RSCP NPs) are reported to perform targeted delivery of multiple drugs and effectively reduce nonspecific enrichment. These results showed that the dual&#8208;targeting and multiple&#8208;signaling response (red light signaling and different pH microenvironments) of the RSCP NPs enabled the precise delivery of astaxanthin (Asta) and rosiglitazone (Rosi) to M1&#8208;like macrophages and white adipocytes, respectively, to alleviate the low&#8208;grade inflammation of white adipose tissue (WAT) and promote white adipocyte browning. Moreover, RSCP NPs&#8208;mediated Asta and Rosi treatment robustly alleviated insulin resistance and other metabolic disorders in the obese animal models (high&#8208;fat diet (HFD)&#8208;induced or genetically obese mice). Overall, this study provides a theoretical and practical basis for the development and application of novel drug delivery systems for metabolic diseases by elucidating the synergistic long&#8208;term targeting mechanism and target molecule stability of red light&#8208;sensitive bionic nanodrug delivery systems.

         <title>Colorful and Semitransparent Organic Solar Modules via Air&#8208;Blade Assisted Coating of Active Layers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature air&#8208;blade coating facilitated the fabrication of large&#8208;area organic solar modules using eco&#8208;friendly solvents via controlling liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition with directional gas flow, achieving efficient opaque and colorful semitransparent modules.








Abstract
Organic solar modules (OSMs) hold potential for building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics, yet facing challenges to fabricate uniform and large&#8208;area active layers over non&#8208;halogenated solvent coating. In this work, room&#8208;temperature air&#8208;blade assisted (RT/A) coating is presented that helps obtaining uniform active layers under ambient and non&#8208;halogenated solvent processing. It is revealed that RT/A coating mitigates the film inhomogeneity that is commonly observed during hot&#8208;substrate coating. Different to the thermal gradients&#8208;induced inhomogeneous liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition of hot&#8208;substrate coating, RT/A strategy enables the control of transition time on film formation via directional gas flow to yield high&#8208;quality active layer blends at ambient coating. Large&#8208;area active layers from RT/A coating exhibit good consistency and uniformity. The resultant OSMs achieve high efficiencies with the certified PCE of 14.5% at 19.31 cm2 area (recorded in solar cell efficiency tables, version 60). By further integrating Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot transparent electrodes, colorful and semitransparent modules with PCEs of 12.80% are successfully developed. Overall, this work provides a promising method on the scalable fabrication of organic photovoltaics.

         <title>Engineered Nanozymes with Asymmetric Mn&#9472;O&#9472;Ce Sites for Intratumorally Leveraged Multimode Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biodegradable dual&#8208;atom nanozymes with highly asymmetric O&#8208;bridged Ce&#8208;Mn diatomic catalytic centers embedded in the oxygen vacancy&#8208;engineered bimetallic silicate nanospheres is massively produced by a facile hydrothermal method. After loading epigallocatechin&#8208;3&#8208;gallate (EGCG) and modifying with hyaluronic acid, the innovated nanoplatform is used for achieving O2 self&#8208;sufficient photodynamic therapy, tumor glutathione&#8208;depletion/EGCG&#8208;field&#8208;effect enhanced chemdynamic therapy, as well as mild photothermal therapy.








Abstract
Due to the enhanced flexibility of catalytic sites and synergistic effects between dual&#8208;atom active centers, dual&#8208;atom nanozymes stand out in the tumor catalytic therapy. However, precisely regulating the d&#8208;band centers of diatomic sites to break the linear&#8208;scaling relationship between intermediates remains a challenge. Herein, the hydrothermally mass&#8208;produced oxygen vacancies&#8208;engineered bimetallic silicate bio&#8208;nanoplatform with highly asymmetric O&#8208;bridged cerium&#9472;manganese (Ce&#9472;Mn) diatomic catalytic centers (CeMn&#8208;V DAs/EGCG@HA) is meticulously constructed by loading epigallocatechin&#8208;3&#8208;gallate (EGCG) and modifying with hyaluronic acid (HA) for multimodal synergistic cancer therapy. Theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of Ce sites serves as secondary catalytic centers and upshifts d&#8208;band center of the Mn sites, thereby optimizing the adsorption/desorption of oxygen intermediates. The asymmetric Mn&#9472;O&#9472;Ce moiety facilitates electron transport within CeMn&#8208;V DAs, significantly enhancing peroxidase&#8208;like activities (Km = 27.7&#160;mM and Vmax = 3.21&#215;10&#9472;7&#160;M s&#9472;1). Upon 650&#160;nm laser irradiation, CeMn&#8208;V DAs/EGCG inhibits heat shock protein expression, enabling mild&#8208;photothermal (&#951; = 36.1%) therapy, which can productively inhibit tumor growth in vivo, with an inhibition rate of up to 96.2%. Due to the ligand&#8208;field effect of EGCG&#8208;Mn/Ce complexes, high&#8208;valent metal ions are effectively reduced, sustaining an intrinsic self&#8208;driven cocatalytic cycle reaction. Overall, the construction of highly asymmetric bridged diatomic nanozymes will further promote the deep integration of nanotechnology and biology.

         <title>Highly Efficient Narrowband Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Discrete Supramolecular Aggregates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes a discrete supramolecular dimerization strategy for achieving efficient chiral multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters featuring aggregation&#8208;induced circularly polarized luminescence enhancement. The resulting electroluminescence devices achieve narrowband emission with full width at half maximum down to 26 nm and a record&#8208;breaking figure of merit (|gEL| &#215; EQE) of 4.12 &#215; 10&#8722;3.








Abstract
Achieving narrowband emission, high efficiency, and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) remains a significant challenge. In this study, a discrete supramolecular dimerization strategy is presented to overcome this limitation. By incorporating a helical arylamine with a sterically demanding configuration into a multi&#8208;resonance narrowband emitter, the formation of a unique dimeric structure in the solid state is enabled. Unlike conventional multi&#8208;resonance emitters prone to aggregation&#8208;caused quenching and continuous stacking, the CPL emitters form discrete, well&#8208;separated dimers. This distinct supramolecular arrangement not only preserves high photoluminescence quantum yield and narrowband emission but also amplifies CPL signals by optimizing intermolecular electronic coupling. OLEDs incorporating these enantiomers at a 10&#160;wt.% doping level exhibit outstanding performances, including a narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 30&#160;nm, maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of 33.5% and 32.4%, and impressive electroluminescence dissymmetry factors (gEL) of +8.7 &#215; 10&#8722;3 and &#8722;9.1 &#215; 10&#8722;3, respectively. Remarkably, increasing the doping concentration to 20&#160;wt.% further boosts the gEL values to +1.6 &#215; 10&#8722;2 and &#8722;1.8 &#215; 10&#8722;2. This enhancement leads to Figures of Merit (EQE &#215; |gEL|) of 3.71 &#215; 10&#8722;3 and 4.12 &#215; 10&#8722;3, among the highest values for CPL devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving narrowband emission, high efficiency, and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) remains a significant challenge. In this study, a discrete supramolecular dimerization strategy is presented to overcome this limitation. By incorporating a helical arylamine with a sterically demanding configuration into a multi-resonance narrowband emitter, the formation of a unique dimeric structure in the solid state is enabled. Unlike conventional multi-resonance emitters prone to aggregation-caused quenching and continuous stacking, the CPL emitters form discrete, well-separated dimers. This distinct supramolecular arrangement not only preserves high photoluminescence quantum yield and narrowband emission but also amplifies CPL signals by optimizing intermolecular electronic coupling. OLEDs incorporating these enantiomers at a 10&#160;wt.% doping level exhibit outstanding performances, including a narrow full-width at half-maximum of 30&#160;nm, maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of 33.5% and 32.4%, and impressive electroluminescence dissymmetry factors (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;EL&lt;/sub&gt;) of +8.7 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; and &#8722;9.1 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Remarkably, increasing the doping concentration to 20&#160;wt.% further boosts the &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;EL&lt;/sub&gt; values to +1.6 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and &#8722;1.8 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This enhancement leads to Figures of Merit (EQE &#215; |&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;EL&lt;/sub&gt;|) of 3.71 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; and 4.12 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, among the highest values for CPL devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Fine 3D Bioprinting of Dynamic Hyaluronic Acid Hydrogel for in Vitro Modeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D bioprinting merges tissue engineering and additive manufacturing to create biological structures. A bioink is developed by modifying hyaluronic acid, a natural extracellular matrix polymer, with cysteine. Potassium iodide is later added to tune gelation kinetics, enabling fine printing with a 32G needle. This innovation supports precise 3D in vitro models for studying cell interactions, disease mechanisms, and advancing therapeutics.









Abstract
3D bioprinting bridges tissue engineering and additive manufacturing, however developing bioinks with balanced biological and physical properties remains a challenge. Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a promising base material due to its biocompatibility and cell&#8208;recognition features. An HA&#8208;based bioink is designed using dynamic disulfide&#8208;crosslinking at physiological pH by modifying HA with cysteine moieties. To overcome the slow gelation kinetics typical of disulfide&#8208;crosslinked hydrogels, potassium iodide (KI) is introduced, accelerating gelation in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner. KI not only enhances gelation but also provides radical scavenging properties while maintaining hydrogel integrity. A low KI concentration (50&#160;mm) offers more than a 3&#160;h printing window, ensures cell viability, and facilitates the use of fine needles (32G, 108&#160;&#181;m inner diameter). This enables the fabrication of large (&gt;3&#160;cm) and complex 3D structures. Using this bioink, an osteoarthritis disease model is developed to investigate interactions between human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) and chondrocytes, demonstrating the immunomodulatory effect of hMSCs on inflammation&#8208;induced chondrocytes. Overall, the HA&#8208;based bioink addresses critical challenges in 3D bioprinting, providing a robust platform for constructing innovative in vitro models and supporting advancements in disease modeling and precision medicine.

         <title>Full Wafer Scale Manufacturing of Directly Printed TiO2 Metalenses at Visible Wavelengths with Outstanding Focusing Efficiencies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highest experimentally determined focusing efficiency is reported here by using the direct imprinting of all&#8208;inorganic TiO2 metalens arrays. Absolute efficiency greater than 80% and relative efficiency greater than 90% are achieved by optimization of all fabrication parameters controllable in the additive manufacturing process. The highest refractive index of 2.3 is demonstrated by a short post&#8208;imprint ALD process.








Abstract
Highly efficient metalens arrays designed for 550&#160;nm are directly printed using UV&#8208;assisted nanoimprint lithography (UV&#8208;NIL) and a TiO2 nanoparticle (NP)&#8208;based ink on 8&#8243; optical wafers with imprint times less than 5&#160;min. Approximately one&#8208;thousand 4&#8208;mm metalenses are fabricated per wafer with uniform optical performance using a reusable PDMS&#8208;based elastomeric stamp. The absolute and relative focusing efficiencies are as high as 81.2% and 90.4%, respectively, matching closely with the simulated maximum efficiencies of 83% and 91% achievable with the given master design, indicating that future improvements are possible, and efficiencies are not limited by materials or process. The imprinted metalenses are free from organics due to a post&#8208;imprint calcination step and exhibit outstanding dimensional and optical stabilities. The highest efficiencies are attained using imprint formulations comprised of mixtures of 10 and 20&#160;nm TiO2 NPs, whose denser packing not only increases the refractive index (RI) of the calcined lenses up to 2.0 but also reduces the feature shrinkage relative to the master. 25 cycles of atomic layer deposition of TiO2 following imprinting increase the RI up to 2.3 without changing dimensions by uniform gap filling between NPs. This work opens a path for true, full&#8208;scale additive manufacturing of metaoptics.

         <title>Nonlinear Metasurfaces for Completed Control of Amplitude, Phase, and Polarization in Broadband Terahertz Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generic designing approach of nonlinear metasurfaces is proposed for achieving complete amplitude, phase, and polarization control of broadband terahertz generation. The design combines coupling, nonlinear PB phase, and supercell diffraction, making it free from complex nonlinear simulation. Broadband terahertz spatial&#8208;polarization separable and nonseparable beams are experimentally demonstrated. This approach holds potential in developing integrated terahertz sources with customizable functionalities.








Abstract
Terahertz (THz) generation is a crucial initial step in THz applications. However, the current THz sources face challenges in fully controlling the propagation properties of generated THz waves without the use of external devices. This limitation leads to bulky systems with unavoidable insertion losses and bandwidth constraints. To overcome these challenges and facilitate compact and versatile THz applications, a novel approach using nonlinear metasurfaces is proposed to control the amplitude, phase, and polarization of broadband THz waves directly and simultaneously at the emission stage. The basic design features an elaborated coupling&#8208;controlled chiral meta&#8208;atom, providing adjustable chirality and allowing an independent amplitude and phase control strategy under a circularly polarized (CP) pump. Furthermore, the polarization state of emitted THz wave can be arbitrarily customized by designing the superposition of the generated left&#8208;handed circularly polarized (LCP) and right&#8208;handed circularly polarized (RCP) components. This control is linearly predictable, eliminating the need for complex nonlinear simulations and interleaved supercell arrangements. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by experimentally generating two types of unique vectorial THz fields: spatial&#8208;polarization separable and nonseparable states. The proposed approach significantly enhances the capabilities of nonlinear metasurfaces, paving the way for versatile THz generation devices.

         <title>Thermoelectric Field Enhanced Sulfur Evolution Kinetics for High Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>

Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3/carbon nanotubes (BST/CNT) interlayer is designed to enhance the durability of Li&#8208;S batteries by providing extensive adsorption sites and generating a thermoelectric field from the BST thermoelectric material. This research not only demonstrates the effectiveness of the thermoelectric field in enhancing the conversion kinetics of LiPSs but also reveals its potential to boost the performance of Li&#8208;S batteries.








Abstract
The practical deployment of lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries has been impeded by the shuttle effect and sluggish kinetics of lithium polysulfide (LiPSs) conversion. Here, Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3/carbon nanotubes (BST/CNT) interlayer is designed to enhance the durability of Li&#8208;S batteries by providing extensive adsorption sites and generating a thermoelectric field from BST thermoelectric material. Experimental and density functional theory investigations confirm the superior adsorption properties of BST. Additionally, analyses using Gibbs free energy and cyclic voltammetry robustly demonstrate that the thermoelectric field significantly accelerates the conversion kinetics of LiPSs. The electrochemical performance of cells equipped with a 20% BST interlayer is exceptional, showing remarkable stability over 500 cycles at 1 C with a minimal capacity decay rate of 0.05% per cycle. Most importantly, the thermoelectric field substantially improves the conversion kinetics of LiPSs, allowing the cell to maintain a discharge capacity of 594 mAh g&#8722;1 even at 10 C. Furthermore, under conditions of high sulfur loading (7.0 mg cm&#8722;2) and low electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;sulfur ratio (6.1 &#181;L mg&#8722;1), the cell achieves an areal capacity of 5.9 mAh cm&#8722;2. This research not only evidences the effectiveness of the thermoelectric field in enhancing the conversion kinetics of LiPSs but also shows its potential to boost the performance of Li&#8208;S batteries.

Furthermore, under conditions of high sulfur loading (7.0 mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and low electrolyte-to-sulfur ratio (6.1 &#181;L mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), the cell achieves an areal capacity of 5.9 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This research not only evidences the effectiveness of the thermoelectric field in enhancing the conversion kinetics of LiPSs but also shows its potential to boost the performance of Li-S batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Observation of Nonlinear Topological Corner States Originating from Different Spectral Charges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of higher&#8208;order topological insulator with hybrid edges supporting zero&#8208;dimensional corner states originating from different spectral charges is reported. Different spectral charges are manifested in different internal structure and localization properties of topological states, as we demonstrate experimentally in fs&#8208;laser written waveguide arrays. Such topological states give rise to rich families of topological corner solitons at high powers.









Abstract
Higher&#8208;order topological insulators (HOTIs) are unique topological materials supporting edge states with the dimensionality at least by two lower than the dimensionality of the underlying structure. HOTIs are observed on lattices with different symmetries, but only in geometries, where truncation of HOTI produces a finite structure with the same order of discrete rotational symmetry as that of the unit cell, thereby setting the geometry of insulator edge. Here, a new type of 2D HOTI based on the Kekul&#233;&#8208;patterned lattice is experimentally demonstrated, whose order of discrete rotational symmetry differs from that of the unit cells of the constituent honeycomb lattice, with hybrid boundaries that help to produce all three possible corners that support effectively 0D corner states of topological origin, especially the one associated with spectral charge 5/6. It is also shown that linear corner states give rise to rich families of stable hybrid nonlinear corner states bifurcating from them in the presence of focusing nonlinearity of the material. Such new types of nonlinear corner states are observed in hybrid HOTI inscribed in transparent nonlinear dielectric using fs&#8208;laser writing technique. The results complete the class of HOTIs and open the way to observation of topological states with new internal structure and&#160;symmetry.

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Cation Disorder Enhances Comprehensive Performance in Mn&#8208;Rich Layered Sodium Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a tailored annealing strategy to disrupt long&#8208;range cation ordering in Mn&#8208;rich layered oxides (MRLOs), enhancing their electrochemical performance for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Through multiscale structural analyses, including neutron techniques and maximum entropy simulations, improved Na+ diffusion, reduced distortions, and long&#8208;cycle stability, highlighting MRLO as a sustainable, high&#8208;performance cathode material for energy storage applications, are revealed.








Abstract
Mn&#8208;rich layered oxides (MRLOs) are promising low&#8208;cost cathode materials for sustainable sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, the low Mn4+/Mn3+ redox potential limits their energy densities, and the Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion that occurs surrounding Mn3+ at low voltages destabilizes the structure. Additionally, complex ordered structures inherently present in MRLOs hinder Na+ migration. In this study, new types of cation ordering structures are discovered in common MRLOs. By regulating oxygen vacancy formation, the transition from short&#8208;range to long&#8208;range cation ordering is disrupted, effectively mitigating cooperative Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion and achieving a 95.3% capacity retention over 1&#160;000 cycles at 8&#160;C. The maximum entropy method (MEM) analysis is performed based on neutron diffraction data, which visualizes significantly optimized Na+ diffusion pathways in long&#8208;range disordered cathode with enhanced Na+ diffusion kinetics. Furthermore, the formation of oxygen vacancy elevates the Mn4+/Mn3+ redox potential, resulting in a competitive energy density of 626&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 within 1.5&#8211;4.5&#160;V in a half&#8208;cell configuration. This work offers a multiscale approach to precise elucidation of the cathode crystal structure and provides a feasible pathway to optimize sodium&#8208;ion cathodes by disrupting long&#8208;range cation ordering, ultimately facilitating substantial improvements in electrochemical performance.

         <title>Nucleation&#8208;Layer Assisted Quasi&#8208;2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Tin Perovskite Solar Cells with High Oxygen Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleation&#8208;layer assisted strategy is developed to achieve quasi&#8208;2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Sn&#8208;based perovskite film with an intermediate&#8208;n&#8208;value dominated narrow phase distribution, vertical crystal orientation, and superior morphology, which enables device with champion efficiency of 11.18% and a record oxygen stability for Sn&#8208;based perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Tin (Sn)&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are extremely vulnerable to oxygen. Nevertheless, mechanism understanding and fundamental strategies to achieve oxygen&#8208;stable Sn&#8208;based PSCs are lacking. Here a nucleation&#8208;layer assisted (NLA) strategy by forming nucleation layer at the interface of hole transport layer and perovskite to attain highly oxygen&#8208;stable quasi&#8208;2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (RP) Sn&#8208;based PSCs is reported. The formation process of nucleation layer consists of washing off the prepared perovskite film and annealing the residue on the substrate, which produces a new substrate for perovskite film fabrication. Such nucleation layer can transform the subsequently deposited perovskite film from a small&#8208;n&#8208;value dominated wide phase distribution with random crystal orientation into an intermediate&#8208;n&#8208;value dominated narrow phase distribution with vertical crystal orientation. This nucleation layer also improves the perovskite film morphology with highly coadjacent flake&#8208;like grains, leading to reduced grain boundaries and pinholes. The resultant NLA perovskite film shows more efficient carrier transport capability, lower exciton&#8208;binding energy, weakened electron&#8208;phonon coupling, and significantly decreased oxygen diffusion rate upon oxygen exposure. Consequently, a quasi&#8208;2D RP Sn&#8208;based PSC with a champion efficiency of 11.18% is obtained. The unencapsulated device preserves 95% of its initial efficiency after a 2700&#8208;h oxygen aging test, creating a record oxygen stability for Sn&#8208;based PSCs.

         <title>Radical TADF: Quartet&#8208;Derived Luminescence with Dark TEMPO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of luminescent organic quantum materials is introduced, formed by attaching a stable radical to TADF chromophores. Due to ferromagnetic exchange coupling, a high&#8208;spin quartet state forms upon excitation, which can thermally access a bright state. &#8776;200&#160;nm tunability of the emission color is reported, and coherent spin manipulations with microwaves are achieved.








Abstract
High&#8208;spin states in organic molecules offer promising tuneability for quantum technologies. Photogenerated quartet excitons are an extensively studied platform, but their applications are limited by the absence of optical read&#8208;out via luminescence. Here, a new class of synthetically accessible molecules with quartet&#8208;derived luminescence is demonstrated, formed by appending a non&#8208;luminescent TEMPO radical to thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) chromophores previously used in OLEDs. The low singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of the chromophore opens a luminescence channel from radical&#8208;triplet coupled states. A set of design rules is established by tuning the energetics in a series of compounds based on a naphthalimide (NAI) core. Generation of quartet states is observed and the strength of radical&#8208;triplet exchange is measured. In DMAC&#8208;TEMPO, up to 72% of detected photons emerge after reverse intersystem crossing from the quartet state repopulates the state with singlet character. This design strategy does not rely on a luminescent radical to provide an emission pathway from the high&#8208;spin state. The large library of TADF chromophores promises a greater pallet of achievable emission colours.

         <title>Mitigating Mobile&#8208;Ion&#8208;Induced Instabilities and Performance Losses in 2D Passivated Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study addresses the challenges of mobile&#8208;ion&#8208;induced instability in perovskite solar cells. Introducing bilayer passivation with ammonium salts (EDAI&#8322;/PEAI and ABS/PEAI) significantly reduces ion density and improves device stability. The approach mitigates the detrimental effects of PEAI&#8208;induced ionic losses, enhancing both performance and operational lifetime under continuous illumination.








Abstract
Bulky ammonium salt&#8208;based passivation is an effective strategy for enhancing the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Especially, phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) is known to greatly improve open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF). Despite these benefits, PEAI passivation leads to substantial short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC) losses and rapid degradation under operational conditions. In this work, it is revealed that the&#160;JSC loss as well as the accelerated degradation in PEAI&#8208;passivated devices is caused by an increased mobile ion density. To mitigate this performance and stability&#8208;limiting mechanism, ultrathin layers of ammonium benzenesulfonate (ABS) and/or ethylenediammonium diiodide (EDAI2) salts are then introduced between the PEAI and the perovskite, which stabilize the 2D perovskite layer and impede diffusion even under upon prolonged illumination. This leads to a reduced mobile ion density both in fresh devices and in the long term, lowering losses&#160;JSC, and thus enables power conversion efficiencies of &#8776;25% with enhanced stability. Overall, this study not only addresses the limitations of PEAI&#8208;based 2D passivation but also paves the way for understanding 2D&#8208;induced ionic&#160;JSC losses.

         <title>Uni&#8208;Axial Densification of Slurry&#8208;Casted Li&#8326;PS&#8325;Cl Tapes: The Role of Particle Size Distribution and Densification Pressure</title>

         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state batteries&#160;promise high energy density and safety for electric vehicles. This study examines the densification of slurry&#8208;casted Li&#8326;PS&#8325;Cl separator tapes, highlighting the role of particle size distribution&#160;and uni&#8208;axial pressure. Wet milling refines particles while preserving conductivity, and a critical compaction threshold leads to superior performance. Structural defects, however, impact cycling stability, underscoring processing optimization needs.









Abstract
Solid&#8208;state batteries&#160;are transformative solutions for electric vehicles, offering superior energy density and safety. Sulfide&#8208;based solid electrolytes&#160;like Li&#8326;PS&#8325;Cl (LPSCl) combine high ionic conductivity and mechanical adaptability, but challenges remain in scaling up high&#8208;performance separator tapes due to particle size distribution (PSD) and processing constraints. This study investigates the uni&#8208;axial densification of slurry&#8208;casted LPSCl tapes, focusing on PSD refinement and compaction pressure. Wet milling has been identified to effectively reduce PSD to submicron levels while preserving structural integrity and near&#8208;pristine conductivity. A critical pressure threshold (&#8776;350&#160;MPa) for tape&#8208;casted LPSCl slurries (2.5% hydrated poly(acrylonitrile&#8208;co&#8208;butadiene)) is identified, where ionic conductivity peaks due to particle fusion and the formation of conductive networks. However, open porosity (&#8776;30%), particularly along the densification direction, and surface irregularities persist. These structural issues have significant implications for battery performance. For example, surface roughness and interfacial voids lead to localized current focusing, with current densities exceeding applied values by over 20 times. Percolating porosity accelerates dendritic failure modes, undermining stability and limiting cycling rates. This work underscores the need for optimized powder processing and densification techniques to enhance scalability and performance, advancing LPSCl&#8208;based separators for the practical adoption of solid&#8208;state batteries&#160;in electric vehicles&#160;and other high&#8208;energy applications.

         <title>Photothermal&#8208;Responsive Aerogel&#8208;Hydrogel Binary System for Efficient Water Purification and All&#8208;Weather Hydrovoltaic Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work develops a binary aerogel&#8208;hydrogel system (SHA&#8208;HVG), achieving efficient water desalination (2.75 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) and high power density (56.86 &#181;W cm&#8722;2) through enhanced interfacial evaporation and ionic concentration gradients. This study presents a cost&#8208;effective HVG strategy for water desalination and electrical energy harvesting, which is expected to promote the development of distributed energy, smart agriculture, and offshore ecosystems.








Abstract
Hydrovoltaic generators (HVGs) convert abundant water energy into distributed electricity to promote the Internet of Things. Realizing low&#8208;cost yet high&#8208;performance HVG remains challenging, hindering its commercialization and application. Inspired by the xylem conduits in plants, which transport water and nutrients, an aerogel&#8208;hydrogel binary&#8208;component system (SHA&#8208;HVG) is developed. It consists of a photothermal graphite&#8208;doped polyvinylidene fluoride (G&#8208;PVDF) aerogel, infilled with a thermosensitive wettability&#8208;switchable sulfonic acid&#8208;modified polyisopropylacrylamide hydrogel (S&#8208;PNIPAM) by in situ polymerization, which significantly promotes water/ion transporting and boosts electricity output. SHA&#8208;HVG demonstrates all&#8208;weather high output by cooperating power generation mechanisms of thermosensitive hydrogel&#8208;promoted surface photothermal evaporation during the daytime and sulfonic group&#8208;enhanced ion concentration gradient at nighttime, resulting in efficient water desalination (2.75 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) and a 2669% increase in power density (56.86 &#181;W cm&#8722;2) compared to single&#8208;component HVG of G&#8208;PVDF. SHA&#8208;HVG is chemically stable and can be reactivated/recycled to improve its power generation efficiency to &#8764;130% by increasing its built&#8208;in ionic environment. A marine/offshore cultivation system is demonstrated using an SHA&#8208;HVG array, realizing an autonomous greenhouse for water desalination, self&#8208;irrigation, and self&#8208;powered environment monitoring. This work presents a cost&#8208;effective HVG strategy for efficient seawater desalination and electricity harvesting, envisioning the development of distributed energy, smart agriculture, and offshore planting.

         <title>Interlayer Design for Halide Electrolytes in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide solid electrolytes, an emerging family of materials, encounter anodic stability challenges that limit their application. By synthesizing Li3YbCl6 and Li3LuCl6 and incorporating a Li6PI3 interlayer, this study achieves lithium&#8208;stable halide electrolytes with reduced interface resistance and enhanced critical current density. These advancements pave the way for safer, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries for electric transportation.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries (ASSLMBs) are promising for transportation electrification due to their superior safety and high energy density. Lithium halide electrolytes provide excellent processing flexibility, high ionic conductivity, and anodic stability (&gt;4.1&#160;V), making them highly compatible with high&#8208;voltage cathodes, surpassing sulfide electrolytes (&lt;2.1&#160;V). Nevertheless, halide electrolytes suffer from low cathodic stability and form an electronically conductive interphase with lithium, resulting in a critical current density (CCD) of nearly zero. Herein, Li3YbCl6 electrolytes are synthesized that are kinetically stable with lithium by forming an electronic insulating solid electrolyte interphase. Guided by critical overpotential criteria, a PI3 interlayer is designed that transforms into Li6PI3 upon contact with lithium, substantially reducing the interfacial resistance of Li3YbCl6 against lithium to 34 &#937; and achieving a high critical overpotential of 114&#160;mV. By substituting Yb with Lu, Li3LuCl6 electrolytes with Li6PI3 interlayers reach a CCD of 1.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a capacity of 1.0 mAh cm&#8722;2, comparable to sulfide electrolytes but with higher oxidation stability. Additionally, Li6PI3 enables stable cycling of Li//Li cells with Li3LuCl6 electrolytes at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 400 cycles and maintains 86.5% capacity in Li//LiCoO2 cells after 220 cycles at 30&#160;&#176;C, paving the way for high&#8208;performance ASSLMBs.

Guided by critical overpotential criteria, a PI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; interlayer is designed that transforms into Li&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;PI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; upon contact with lithium, substantially reducing the interfacial resistance of Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;YbCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; against lithium to 34 &#937; and achieving a high critical overpotential of 114&#160;mV. By substituting Yb with Lu, Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;LuCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; electrolytes with Li&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;PI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; interlayers reach a CCD of 1.0&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at a capacity of 1.0 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, comparable to sulfide electrolytes but with higher oxidation stability. Additionally, Li&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;PI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; enables stable cycling of Li//Li cells with Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;LuCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; electrolytes at 0.5&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 400 cycles and maintains 86.5% capacity in Li//LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cells after 220 cycles at 30&#160;&#176;C, paving the way for high-performance ASSLMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Iron Balance Dual&#8208;Drive Strategy (IBDS) Promotes Bone Regeneration in Smokers by Regulating Mitochondrial Iron Homeostasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cigarette smoke disrupts cellular iron balance, impairing bone healing in smokers. An iron balance dual&#8208;drive strategy combats this by removing harmful excess iron from &#8220;cell powerhouses&#8221; and boosting natural iron storage. This dual&#8208;action restores energy production, blocks cell death, and accelerates bone repair&#8212;a breakthrough approach for treating smoking&#8208;related bone defects and iron&#8208;overload diseases.








Abstract
Cigarette smoke (CS) disrupts mitochondrial iron homeostasis, causing excess free iron to generate reactive oxygen species, leading to oxidative stress and impairing tissue repair. For smokers undergoing bone defect repair, achieving precise control over the balance between mitochondrial free iron and stored iron, while simultaneously enhancing endogenous iron homeostasis, poses a considerable challenge. This study introduces the iron balance dual&#8208;drive strategy (IBDS), which efficiently chelates mitochondrial free iron and promotes ferritin synthesis to create a FerritinBank for iron deposition, thus optimizing endogenous iron homeostasis. IBDS is delivered through an injectable, biodegradable iron&#8208;capturing hydrogel (SilMA/gelMA/DPT). The released DPT selectively targets and chelates free iron within mitochondria, modulating mitochondrial dynamics to restore their function. This action is complemented by the promotion of ferritin synthesis, which serves to bolster endogenous iron homeostasis and suppress ferroptosis. Transcriptomic sequencing and experimental data suggest that DPT corrects energy metabolism abnormalities and promotes mitochondrial macromolecule synthesis. In vivo studies confirm that the iron&#8208;capturing hydrogel significantly improves the healing of smoking&#8208;induced calvarial bone defects. This is the first report of nanoparticles promoting ferritin synthesis to build an endogenous iron reservoir, highlighting the potential of the IBDS strategy for bone regeneration in smokers and other iron&#8208;overload&#8208;related conditions.

         <title>Efficient Sn&#8208;Pb Perovskite Solar Cells Through Inhibiting Hole Accumulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here this study discovers that hole accumulation is an inevitable reason for Sn2+ oxidation in Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Basing on this, a non&#8208;planar hole transport layer of P3CT/Me&#8208;4PACz is designed. P3CT/Me&#8208;4PACz will form non&#8208;planar films with spikes penetrating perovskite bulk, inhibiting holes accumulation. Resulted PSCs exhibit &gt;24% efficiency with good stability, retaining 82% of initial efficiency after MPP tracking for 1000 h.








Abstract
Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite solar cells (PSCs) own the highest theoretical efficiency due to their ideal bandgap. However, the efficiency of Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs remains 22&#8211;23% at present, which is much lower than Pb&#8208;based PSCs. One key reason lies in the Sn2+ oxidation issue. Here, this study demonstrates that apart from well&#8208;known chemical environmental oxidation, photo&#8208;generated holes and their accumulation are also a critical factor for Sn2+ oxidation in Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs. To address this issue, a non&#8208;planar hole transport layer (HTL) of P3CT/Me&#8208;4PACz is designed through solution micelle regulation. P3CT/Me&#8208;4PACz will form a 3D HTL film with a spike&#8208;like structure penetrating Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite bulk to accelerate hole extraction, thus inhibiting holes accumulation and Sn2+ oxidation. Resulted Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs exhibit the highest efficiency of over 24% with good operational stability, retaining 82% of initial efficiency after continuous MPP tracking for 1000 h at an elevated temperature of 55&#160;&#176;C.

A new family of Na&#8208;Zr&#8208;S&#8208;Cl sulfide&#8208;chloride Na SSEs with tailored anion compositions is explored. A high ionic conductivity is realized for both Cl&#8208;rich and Cl&#8208;deficient structures, attributed to the unique chloride bridging structure and low Na&#8208;ion migration barrier. The Cl&#8208;deficient structure demonstrates excellent stability for solid&#8208;state Na&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state Na batteries (SSNBs) are among the most promising next&#8208;generation energy storage devices due to their high energy density, enhanced safety, and cost&#8208;efficiency. Achieving high&#8208;performance SSNBs depends on the development of solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with excellent ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical windows, and robust mechanical properties. Sulfide and halide&#8208;based Na SSEs have been widely studied in recent years with their respective strengths and limitations. Herein for the first time, a new family of Na&#8208;Zr&#8208;S&#8208;Cl sulfide&#8208;chloride Na SSEs with tailored anion compositions is explored. A high ionic conductivity of 4.89 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 is realized with a Cl&#8208;rich structure, attributed to the unique chloride bridging structure and low Na&#8208;ion migration barrier. Furthermore, by tuning the ratio between sulfur and chloride anions, two different unique structures are obtained with different surface morphology, thermal stability, mechanical properties, and electrochemical stability. The Cl&#8208;deficient structure of Na2S&#8208;1.3ZrCl4 SSEs demonstrates excellent stability for solid&#8208;state Na&#8208;ion batteries, maintaining a high reversible capacity of over 90 mAh g&#8722;1 after 600 cycles at 0.1 C. This study offers insights into the design of new Na SSEs, advancing the development of safer and high&#8208;performance SSNBs.

         <title>Photothermal Nanotrigger Enables Rapid Gelation and Spatially&#8208;Programmable Printability Under Broad&#8208;Spectrum Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An original and generic concept of photothermal nanotrigger is proposed to transform inherently uncontrollable thermal initiation into spatially&#8208;programmable photoinitiation via the classic photothermal effect, conferring rapid gelation and spatially&#8208;programmable printability under broad&#8208;spectrum light. Unlike conventional small&#8208;molecule initiators that are normally consumed, photothermal nanotrigger can parasitize hydrogel networks as an additional functional medium to give some new functions or intensify the performance of hydrogels.








Abstract
Controllable and versatile manufacturing of nanocomposite hydrogels is highly desirable for attaining preferential performance and pushing their applications. However, the conventional thermal&#8208;initiated method suffers from sluggish and uncontrollable bulky gelation, whereas the photo&#8208;initiated method is controllable yet is limited by a special wavelength of light and is ineffective for hydrogel precursors containing light&#8208;absorbing conductive/magnetic nanomaterials. Herein, these limitations are fundamentally overcome, and a new concept of photothermal nanotrigger (PTNT) is discovered that leverages the classic photothermal effect of light&#8208;absorbing nanomaterials to transform uncontrollable thermal initiation into a new photo&#8208;controlled initiation. The design of PTNT is universal and can be extended for arbitrary photothermal nanomaterials from 2D nanosheets to 1D nanotubes and 0D nanoparticles, exhibiting high gelation efficiency and superior compatibility to broad&#8208;spectrum light from visible to ultraviolet and near&#8208;infrared. Intriguingly, the PTNT approach can be imparted with excellent spatially&#8208;programmable printability by introducing viscous and low thermally&#8208;conductive glycerol to confine the photothermal&#8208;generated heat and eliminate the diffusion of the formed free radicals to the unexposed region, enabling the manufacturing of high&#8208;resolution and heterogenous architecture. Moreover, in addition to the basic initiation function, the PTNT can parasitize the hydrogel network to find many additional applications in the fields of flexible electronics, light/magnetic&#8208;manipulated soft robotics, and beyond.

Intriguingly, the PTNT approach can be imparted with excellent spatially-programmable printability by introducing viscous and low thermally-conductive glycerol to confine the photothermal-generated heat and eliminate the diffusion of the formed free radicals to the unexposed region, enabling the manufacturing of high-resolution and heterogenous architecture. Moreover, in addition to the basic initiation function, the PTNT can parasitize the hydrogel network to find many additional applications in the fields of flexible electronics, light/magnetic-manipulated soft robotics, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ice&#8208;Confined Cryo&#8208;Polymerization of Sponge&#8208;Like Hydrogels with Self&#8208;Adapting Channel for Solar Water Purification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ice&#8208;confined cryo&#8208;polymerization method is proposed for the preparation of sponge&#8208;like hydrogels. By this method, strong interactions between polymer chains and orientation can be realized, and the hydrogels are endowed with ultrafast water transport capability. The spongy hydrogels are also able to self&#8208;regulate the pore size under different light intensities achieving ultra&#8208;high water evaporation rates.








Abstract
Polymer hydrogels are widely used in solar&#8208;driven water evaporation due to their controllable vaporization enthalpy, but the low water transport rates restrict their application. Here, a sponge&#8208;like polyacrylamide/carbon nanotube hydrogel is prepared by ice&#8208;confined cryo&#8208;polymerization, which possesses micro&#8208;size and non&#8208;swelling skeleton, and exhibits both hydrogel and sponge behaviors such as excellent squeezability and superior water transport capabilities about three orders of magnitude higher than that of conventional hydrogels. Moreover, the hydrogels can spontaneously regulate the size of internal channels to adjust the capillary force and thus they can support a water evaporation rate as high as 36.11&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 under collecting lens. Furthermore, the hydrogels show high water collection rate of 5.55&#160;g g&#8722;1 under fog flow and the collected water can be quickly released by squeezing. The ice&#8208;confined cryo&#8208;polymerization provides a new way to develop distinctive materials combining the advantage of both hydrogel and sponge.

         <title>Amidinium&#8208;Based 2D Spacer Cations Enhance Efficiency and High&#8208;Temperature Photostability of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D/3D heterostructures have significantly advanced the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but their long&#8208;term photostability at elevated temperatures remains a major challenge. This study introduces amidinium&#8208;based 2D spacer cations with high pKa values to improve both the photostability and efficiency of PSCs. Unlike traditional ammonium&#8208;based passivators, amidinium cations effectively prevent detrimental deprotonation reactions that occur at high temperatures, ensuring a stable interface between 2D and 3D perovskite phases. As a result, PSCs with amidinium passivation retain 90.6% of their initial efficiency after 1000&#160;h of operation at 85&#160;&#176;C. Furthermore, amidinium&#8208;based 2D perovskite films provide excellent bulk and surface passivation effects, enabling the highest PCE of 26.52% among all reported 2D/3D PSC devices. These findings offer a promising route toward developing more durable and efficient PSCs.








Abstract
2D/3D perovskite heterojunctions represent a promising approach to enhance the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the photostability at elevated temperatures of conventional 2D/3D heterostructures, employing ammonium&#8208;based spacer cations, is severely limited by deprotonation reactions, hindering their practical application. In this study, amidinium&#8208;based 2D spacer cations as an alternative, leveraging their higher acid dissociation constants, to mitigate deprotonation&#8208;induced instability while providing excellent defect passivation effect is introduced. Amidinium passivation not only facilitates formation of thermally stable 2D/3D heterostructures but also suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination and enhances carrier transport dynamics. PSCs with amidinium&#8208;based bulk and surface passivation achieve a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art power conversion efficiency of 26.52% for 2D/3D PSCs and exhibit outstanding high&#8208;temperature photostability, retaining 90.6% of initial efficiency after 1000&#160;h of continuous illumination at maximum power point at 85&#160;&#176;C. This work offers valuable insights into designing high&#8208;performance, durable PSCs under challenging conditions.

         <title>4D&#8208;Printed Adaptive and Programmable Shape&#8208;Morphing Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adaptive programmable shape&#8208;morphing batteries are presented by chemically integrating covalently crosslinked zinc&#8208;ion microbatteries with shape&#8208;programmable liquid crystal elastomers through sequentially direct&#8208;ink&#8208;writing printing. Advanced shape&#8208;morphing battery systems capable of interactive communication and adaptive sensing can autonomously modulate their deployable configuration in response to environmental variations, which enables them to adaptively reconfigure morphology to accommodate different functionalities.









Abstract
Shape&#8208;morphing batteries that can reconfigure their shape to adapt to different tasks are highly desirable for emerging soft electronics in diverse fields. However, it is a challenging task to develop advanced shape&#8208;morphing batteries with on&#8208;demand programmability and adaptive responsiveness. Here, 4D&#8208;printed programmable shape&#8208;morphing batteries by sequentially direct&#8208;ink&#8208;writing of shape&#8208;programmable liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) and in&#8208;situ covalent crosslinked flexible zinc&#8208;ion microbatteries, where tough covalent bonding is built at the interface, are reported. The resulting shape&#8208;morphing batteries exhibit controllable, reversible, and programmable shape&#8208;morphing by controlling sophisticated molecular alignment of LCEs, which enables them to adaptively alter configurations to accommodate different functionalities. Importantly, diverse origami batteries with excellent spatiotemporal controllability are demonstrated by precisely designing active hinges to achieve adaptive transformations from folded to deployed configurations. The programmable shape&#8208;morphing mechanisms of the batteries are revealed by finite element analyses. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept illustration, adaptive shape&#8208;morphing battery systems capable of interactive communication and controllable sensing are developed through the incorporation of an elaborate all&#8208;MXene&#8208;printed near&#8208;field&#8208;communication antenna, which can adaptively tune its deployment configuration according to variations in environmental humidity or dust content. This work brings new insights for the development of next&#8208;generation shape&#8208;morphing power sources, human&#8208;machine interactive electronics, and swarm intelligence.

         <title>Controlled Solution Flow via Patterned Meniscus Assist for Elongated Exciton Diffusion Length to Approaching 20% Efficiency in Pseudo&#8208;Planar Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Patterned meniscus assisted sequential blade&#8208;coated strategy is applied in fabricating pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction organic solar cells, which can stretch polymer chains and facilitate donor/acceptor inter&#8208;penetration to extend exciton diffusion length (from &#8776;45 to &#8776;56 nm) and mitigate Marangoni flow to promote film uniformity by improving solution flow, thus achieving champion efficiency of 19.91% (certified as 19.63%) with one of the minimum efficiency losses during area expansion.








Abstract
Precisely controlling the ideal vertical phase morphology of blade&#8208;coated pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction (PPHJ) organic photovoltaics presents a key challenge due to Marangoni flow and coffee&#8208;ring effect, which further limits large&#8208;area film uniformity and shortens exciton diffusion length. Here, the patterned meniscus assist (PMA) strategy is used to stretch polymer chains and construct regular micropatterns to facilitate donor/acceptor inter&#8208;penetration, resulting in a high&#8208;performance printable PPHJ device with extended exciton diffusion length (from &#8776;45 to &#8776;56&#160;nm). More importantly, micropatterns can mitigate Marangoni flow and promote film uniformity by enhancing solution flow. Consequently, the PPHJ device via PMA strategy exhibits one of the highest power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 19.91% (certified as 19.63%) for the D18/BO&#8208;4Cl:L8&#8208;BO ternary system. Furthermore, the enlarged&#8208;area (1 and 16.94 cm2) devices show competitive PCEs of 18.90%/17.05% with one of the minimum PCE losses (5.07%/14.36%) during area expansion. This PMA strategy provides a feasible guiding avenue for realizing ideal active layer morphology to obtain large&#8208;scale, high&#8208;efficiency PPHJ devices.

         <title>Reinforced Perovskite&#8208;Substrate Interfaces via Multi&#8208;Sited and Dual&#8208;Sided Anchoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The perovskite&#8208;substrate interfaces are reinforced by using a dual&#8208;sided anchoring polymeric hole transporter, which enables significantly enhanced interfacial adhesion and defect passivation. The resulting inverted structured perovskite solar cells achieve 26.8% efficiency with excellent operational stability at 85&#160;&#176;C. This work demonstrates the critical role of interfacial stabilization for high&#8208;performance and stable perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Interfacial reliability is critical for the long&#8208;term stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), yet the perovskite&#8208;substrate interface represents the most vulnerable part in high&#8208;efficiency devices. Here, this interface, by incorporating a dual&#8208;sided anchoring polymeric hole&#8208;transporting interlayer is reinforced with abundant coordinating pyridyl units as side chains, which induces strong adhesion between the perovskite and substrate by forming multidimensional interactions with adjacent layers. This simultaneously enhances the mechanical strength through effective distribution and dissipation of mechanical stress and the electronic quality of the perovskite&#8208;substrate interface through defect passivation. The resulting PSCs exhibit a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.8% (certified at 26.6%). With a more robust perovskite composition, devices maintain 98% of their initial PCE of &#8776;26% after maximum&#8208;power&#8208;point tracking at 85&#160;&#176;C for 1500&#160;h. These devices exhibit excellent fatigue resistance under thermal cycling (&#8208;40 to 85&#160;&#176;C), retaining 93% efficiency after undergoing 900 cycles.

         <title>CO2 Laser&#8208;Stabilized Ni&#8208;Co Dual Single&#8208;Atomic Sites for Energy Generation and Ammonia Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid, scalable CO2&#8208;laser irradiation method is reported to anchor Ni and Co as dual single atoms on L&#8208;tryptophan&#8208;modified Ti3C2Tx MXene (DSAC). The resulting DSAC enables efficient NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208; NH3 conversion in a Zn&#8211;NO3&#8722; battery, achieving simultaneous nitrate removal, energy generation, and ammonia synthesis via a potential&#8208;resolved reaction pathway.








Abstract
Dual single&#8208;atom catalysts (DSACs) hold immense potential in electrochemical nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction (EcNR) as a sustainable replacement to the Haber&#8211;Bosch process for the production of ammonia (NH3). However, challenges such as synthesis complexity, low purity, scalability, and stability have hindered their practical application. Herein, a rapid and scalable method is introduced to stabilize low&#8208;cost 3d transition metals (Ni and Co) as DSACs on Ti3C2Tx MXene in 10&#160;min using continuous&#8208;wave CO2&#8208;laser irradiation. Ni2+ and Co2+ ions are chelated and stabilized as single atoms onto an L&#8208;tryptophan&#8208;modified Ti3C2Tx surface via metal&#9472;O and metal&#9472;N bonds, forming Ni&#8208;single atom catalyst (SAC)/MXene, Co&#8208;SAC/MXene, and NiCo&#8208;DSAC/MXene. This approach enhances MXene properties, enabling the synthesis of efficient atomic&#8208;level electrocatalysts. Potential&#8208;resolved in situ Raman spectroelectrochemistry and density functional theory reveal that EcNR proceeds through NO3&#8722; reduction to *NO2, *NO, *NH, and *NH2 intermediates, ultimately forming NH3 via final protonation step. This process exhibits a low limiting potential of &#8722;0.37&#160;V, with *NO2 protonation identified as the critical step. NiCo&#8208;DSAC/MXene exhibited superior EcNR performance for NH3 production in 1.0&#160;M potassium hydroxide with sustained multiple cyclic stability. Furthermore, this catalyst is integrated into a Zn&#8211;NO3&#8722; a battery that simultaneously removes NO3&#8722;, generates energy, and synthesizes NH3.

         <title>An Interlayer Anchored NiMo/MoO2 Electrocatalyst for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis at High Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cost&#8208;effective and scalable method is developed to construct an interlayer&#8208;anchored heterostructured electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution at ampere&#8208;scale current densities. The noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free anion&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolysis device, utilizing this catalyst as the cathode, exhibits superior activity and stability. This study offers insights into the design of efficient and robust HER catalysts for industrial&#8208;scale hydrogen generation.








Abstract
Noble metal&#8208;free electrodes for anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEM&#8208;WE) operating at high current densities are critical for sustainable hydrogen production. However, the massive amount of bubbles resulted in insufficient mass transfer and unevenly distributed local stress, which poses a major challenge in designing an efficient and robust hydrogen evolution catalyst. Herein, a facile chemical corrosion method is developed to synthesize an interlayer&#8208;anchored NiMo/MoO2 catalyst on a nickel foam (NF) substrate (NiMo/Int/NF) with high hydrogen evolution activity (overpotential of 80.2 &#177; 3.53&#160;mV) and durability (stable for 5000&#160;h) at 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 1&#160;m KOH. The interlayer tightly anchors the catalytic layer to the substrate, providing high compressive strength and strong adhesion to mitigate the bubble shock at a high current density. In situ Raman and X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses reveal that the heterostructural catalytic layer can accelerate the hydrogen evolution reaction with increased local pH and high component utilization. Using NiMo/Int/NF as the cathode, the assembled noble metal&#8208;free AEM&#8208;WE device exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.78&#160;V at 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 (significantly lower than that of a Pt/C&#8208;catalyzed cell (1.94&#160;V)) while also showing excellent stability for 3000&#160;h.

         <title>Synthesis of Ultrathin Mesoporous CuxRu Nanomeshes for Efficient Kilowatt&#8208;Level Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 30, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under the guidance of theoretical calculations, a mesoporous CuxRu nanomesh structure is synthesized, with a thickness of 2&#8211;3&#160;nm and a pore distribution ranging from 2 to 10&#160;nm. An anion exchange membrane electrolyzer assembled with this catalyst demonstrates kilowatt&#8208;level nitrate reduction performance.








Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of abundant nitrate ions from industrial wastewater and polluted groundwater into value&#8208;added ammonia represents an important route for the sustainable development of human society. However, developing efficient and stable catalysts remains a huge challenge. Herein, the synthesis of ultrathin mesoporous CuxRu nanomeshes is reported via a theory&#8208;guided ion exchange method for efficient nitrate reduction to ammonia. The prepared CuxRu nanomeshes are composed of Cu atoms anchored ultrathin mesoporous Ru nanomeshes, with a thickness of &#8776;2&#8211;3&#160;nm and a pore distribution between 2 and 10&#160;nm. It offers a high nitrate reduction performance, including a positive onset potential (0.41&#160;V), a high ammonia Faradaic efficiency (94.5%) and a highest ammonia mass activity (0.7 A mg&#8722;1) at 0&#160;V up to date. Moreover, a kilowatt&#8208;level nitrate reduction is first verified in a flow electrolyzer, with the fastest reported NO3&#8722; removal velocity of 12.4&#160;mmol min&#8722;1. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations clearly reveal that Cu atoms can balance the energy barriers in nitrate reduction and competitive hydrogen evolution reactions, leading to improved catalytic performance.

Herein, the synthesis of ultrathin mesoporous Cu&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Ru nanomeshes is reported via a theory-guided ion exchange method for efficient nitrate reduction to ammonia. The prepared Cu&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Ru nanomeshes are composed of Cu atoms anchored ultrathin mesoporous Ru nanomeshes, with a thickness of &#8776;2&#8211;3&#160;nm and a pore distribution between 2 and 10&#160;nm. It offers a high nitrate reduction performance, including a positive onset potential (0.41&#160;V), a high ammonia Faradaic efficiency (94.5%) and a highest ammonia mass activity (0.7 A mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) at 0&#160;V up to date. Moreover, a kilowatt-level nitrate reduction is first verified in a flow electrolyzer, with the fastest reported NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; removal velocity of 12.4&#160;mmol min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations clearly reveal that Cu atoms can balance the energy barriers in nitrate reduction and competitive hydrogen evolution reactions, leading to improved catalytic performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Mechanical Metamaterials
In article number 2420063, Horacio D. Espinosa and co&#8208;workers introduce a data&#8208;efficient inverse design framework using neural operators trained on sparse experimental data to predict and tailor the nonlinear mechanical behavior of spinodal metamaterials. The approach enables accurate, application&#8208;driven design of architected materials for extreme environments&#8212;paving the way for next&#8208;generation aerospace and multifunctional systems.

Polarization Sensitive Vacuum&#8208;Ultraviolet Photodetectors
In article number 2503846, Le Chen, Hongwei Liang, Hong Yin, and colleagues develop wafer&#8208;scale low&#8208;symmetry m&#8208;plane h&#8208;BN epitaxial films with strong anisotropy, achieving polarization detection in the VUV region. The anisotropic m&#8208;plane h&#8208;BN harvests a polarization ratio of 6.2 for 188 nm polarized light, reaching the short&#8208;wavelength limit of existing direct detection technologies. This work demonstrates a novel strategy for polarized VUV photodetectors and paves the way for novel integrated optoelectronics based on traditional 2D materials.

Concentric Supraparticle Architecture
Precise concentric layers define self&#8208;assembled multilayered supraparticles (SAMS), a novel architecture achieved through a three&#8208;way interaction of gold nanoparticles, gelatin, and lipidoid. This unique design facilitates environmentally triggered disassembly and efficient in vivo siRNA delivery for gene silencing. SAMS represent an efficient integration of structural control and therapeutic function, marking a significant step forward in nanomedicine and complex supraparticle synthesis. More details can be found in article number 2502055 by Raghuraman Kannan and co&#8208;workers.

Multiferroic Materials
Electric&#8208;field driven reversal of magnetization in (110)&#8208;oriented Co&#8208;substituted BiFeO3 thin films at room temperature is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated by Takuma Itoh, Kei Shigematsu, Hena Das, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2419580. The frontispiece shows that an in&#8208;plane electric field through the thin film leads to the reversal of the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane component of magnetization, which is particularly desirable for memory device applications.

&lt;p&gt;Electric-field driven reversal of magnetization in (110)-oriented Co-substituted BiFeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; thin films at room temperature is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated by Takuma Itoh, Kei Shigematsu, Hena Das, and co-workers in article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202419580"&gt;2419580&lt;/a&gt;. The frontispiece shows that an in-plane electric field through the thin film leads to the reversal of the out-of-plane component of magnetization, which is particularly desirable for memory device applications.

Magnetic Properties
Ultrasensitive mechanical detection of antiferromagnetic spin texture in a 2D magnetic crystal MnPS3 is achieved through nanomechanical resonators. Collective magnetic domain transitions were observed from the abrupt frequency jumps in both the linear and nonlinear resonator responses. The results indicate rich and fluid&#8208;like dynamics between the coupled spin and lattice at the transition field, and will inspire the next&#8208;generation nanomechanical devices coupled with spin textures for both classical and quantum information technologies. More details can be found in article number 2420168 by Elton J. G. Santos, Philip X.&#8208;L. Feng, Xiao&#8208;Xiao Zhang, and co&#8208;workers.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent progress of all&#8208;inorganic Sn&#8208;containing PSCs in the aspects of efficiency and stability, including the basic properties and degradation mechanisms/pathways of pristine Sn and mixed Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites, as well as various strategies to improve the photovoltaic performance of devices, discuss the existing challenges in this field, and look forward to the prospects for further improvement.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic tin (Sn)&#8208;containing perovskites have emerged as highly promising photovoltaic materials for single&#8208;junction and tandem perovskite solar cells (PSCs), owing to their reduced toxicity, optimal narrow bandgap, and superior thermal stability. Since their initial exploration in 2012, significant advancements have been achieved, with the highest efficiencies of single&#8208;junction and tandem devices now surpassing 17% and 22%, respectively. Nevertheless, the intrinsic challenges associated with the oxidation susceptibility of Sn2+ and the uncontrolled crystallization dynamics impede their further development. Addressing these issues necessitates a comprehensive and systematic understanding of the degradation mechanisms inherent to all&#8208;inorganic Sn&#8208;containing perovskites, as well as the development of effective mitigation strategies. This review provides a detailed overview of the research progress in all&#8208;inorganic Sn&#8208;containing PSCs, with a particular focus on the basic properties and degradation pathways of both pristine Sn and mixed Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites. Furthermore, various strategies to improve the efficiency and stability of Sn&#8208;containing PSCs are thoroughly discussed. Finally, the existing challenges and perspectives are provided for further improving the photovoltaic performance of eco&#8208;friendly PSCs.

         <title>Mechanostimulatory Platform for Improved CAR T Cell Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel T&#8208;cell mechanostimulatory platform with controlled elasticity and nanotopography optimize T&#8208;cell activation by reducing T&#8208;cell exhaustion and enhancing central memory T&#8208;cell differentiation. This platform is utilized for the generation of Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cells, demonstrating improved antitumor efficacy, as validated through ex vivo and in vivo studies.








Abstract
Chimeric Antigen Receptor T (CAR T) cell immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, yet it is hindered by rapid T&#8208;cell exhaustion caused by uncontrolled activation during CAR generation. Leveraging insights into T&#8208;cell mechanosensing, a novel mechanostimulatory platform is engineered for T&#8208;cell activation based on an antigen&#8208;carrying surface with controlled elasticity and nanotopography. The platform is designed to optimize and balance T&#8208;cell exhaustion, proliferation, and CAR expression. It enhances the differentiation of T cells into the central memory subset, which is crucial for the persistence of CAR T cell therapy's anticancer effects. The platform produces CAR T cells with higher antitumor efficacy, as validated through ex vivo experiments, and with higher in vivo persistence and ability to suppress tumor proliferation, as compared to CAR T cells generated by standard protocols. RNA&#8208;seq analysis confirmed an increased transcriptional signature of central memory T cells. Furthermore, this platform completely eliminates T&#8208;cell toxicity associated with the non&#8208;viral transfection process typically observed with standard activation methods. This platform presents a promising pathway for improving the efficiency and safety of CAR T cell therapy.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Photodetectors Based On Band Engineering and Ferroelectric Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>

Ga2O3&#8208;based deep&#8208;ultraviolet photodetectors achieve high&#8208;sensitivity detection under low operating voltage and ultraweak light intensity conditions, enabled by effective carrier separation and transport through BaTiO3 interlayer modulation.








Abstract
Wide bandgap semiconductors have emerged as a class of deep&#8208;ultraviolet sensitive materials, showing great potentials for next&#8208;generation integrated devices. Yet, to achieve a high photoresponse of deep&#8208;ultraviolet detector without complicated designs at low supply voltage and weak light intensity is challenging. Herein, a new way is designed to fabricate an ultrasensitive vertical&#8208;structured photodetector with epitaxial 7&#160;nm BaTiO3 interlayer and 10&#160;nm Ga2O3 photosensitive layer, realizing the detection to a rare weak deep UV light intensity (0.1&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2) at a voltage under 4.8&#160;V and demonstrating a surge in responsivity up to 1.1&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 with ultrafast response of 0.24 &#181;s/33.4 &#181;s (rise/decay). A responsivity of 3.8&#160;mA&#160;W&#8722;1 at 0&#160;V also has been reached. The dark current is suppressed by enlarged conduction band offset and meanwhile the photocurrent is enhanced by unidirectional conducting valance band offset, which formed by BaTiO3 interlayer. BaTiO3 also contributes most to the photoresponse at 0&#160;V through its ferroelectric depolarization electric field. These results provide a path toward high&#8208;sensitive, low&#8208;power&#8208;consumption, and highly&#8208;integrated deep&#8208;ultraviolet detection, beyond conventional ones.

         <title>Ultrafast Laser Synthesis of Zeolites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study presents a novel ultrafast laser&#8208;driven synthesis technique for zeolites directly in liquid. Laser pulses create a microscopic reactor that controls reaction kinetics at femto&#8208; and picosecond timescales. Nonlinear light&#8208;matter interactions drive nucleation and growth, allowing the process to be paused at any stage of self&#8208;assembly.








Abstract
Research demonstrates that zeolite nucleation and growth can be controlled by fine&#8208;tuning chemical composition, temperature, and pressure, resulting in structures with diverse porosities and functionalities. Nevertheless, current energy delivery methods lack the finesse required to operate on the femto&#8208; and picosecond timescales of silica polymerization and depolymerization, limiting their ability to direct synthesis with high precision. To overcome this limitation, an ultrafast laser synthesis technique is introduced, capable of delivering energy at these timescales with unprecedented spatiotemporal precision. Unlike conventional or emerging approaches, this method bypasses the need for specific temperature and pressure settings, as nucleation and growth are governed by dynamic phenomena arising from nonlinear light&#8211;matter interactions, such as convective flows, cavitation bubbles, plasma formation, and shock waves. These processes can be initiated, paused, and resumed within fractions of a second, effectively &#8220;freezing&#8221; structures at any stage of self&#8208;assembly. Using this approach, the entire nucleation and growth pathway of laser&#8208;synthesized TPA&#8208;silicate&#8208;1 zeolites is traced, from early oligomer formation to fully developed crystals. The unprecedented spatiotemporal control of this technique unlocks new avenues for manipulating reaction pathways and exploring the vast configurational space of zeolites.

         <title>Multifunctional Logic Gates via Coexistent Positive and Negative Photoconductivity of a Single Bi2Se3 Photodetector</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional optoelectronic logic gate is presented based on the coexistence of PPC (Positive Photoconductivity) and NPC(Negative Photoconductivity) in the 2D material Bi2Se3 at different wavelengths. Five logic gate signals (OR, AND, NOT, NOR, and NAND) can be modulated by inputting different wavelengths of light through a single Bi2Se3 photodetector, offering a new method for simple&#8208;structured OELGs.








Abstract
Because existing electronic logic gates have some limitations in the era of information explosion, the demand for substantial amounts of data processing has aroused interest in new types of logic gates. The use of optoelectronic materials to prepare logic gates is popular; however, they often have complex structures, high power consumption, and low reliability. Herein, a new optoelectronic logic gate (OELG) is presented based on the coexistence of positive and negative photoconductivities in the 2D material Bi2Se3 at different wavelengths. Five logic gate signals (OR, AND, NOT, NOR, and NAND) can be modulated by inputting different wavelengths of light (405 and 808 nm) through a single Bi2Se3 photodetector, offering a new method for simple&#8208;structured OELGs. For practical applications, five logic gate output signals are modulated with 100% accuracy on an 8 &#215; 8 pixel array, and simple imaging and logical processing of the images are demonstrated.

         <title>Acid/Base&#8208;Responsive Circularly Polarized Luminescence Emitters with Configurationally Stable Nitrogen Stereogenic Centers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly Polarized Luminescence (CPL) emitters based on Tr&#246;ger's base analogues bearing two peripheral fluorophores (anthracene, pyrene or 9,9&#8208;dimethylfluorene) are prepared following a straightforward and versatile synthetic approach from common precursors. The use of configurationally stable ethano&#8208;bridged Tr&#246;ger's base analogs leads to an acid/base&#8208;driven CPL switch.








Abstract
A way to prevent the fast configurational interconversion of tertiary amines is to invoke Tr&#246;ger's base analogs, which display methano&#8208; or ethano&#8208;bridged diazocine cores fused to aromatic rings. These derivatives are configurationally stable, even in acidic media when their structures bear ethylene bridges. Here, a two&#8208; to three&#8208;step synthesis is presented of methano&#8208; and ethano&#8208;bridged Tr&#246;ger's base analogs with two peripheral fluorophores, i.e., anthracene, pyrene, and 9,9&#8208;dimethylfluorene units. These compounds, possessing two nitrogen stereogenic centers, exhibit good circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) dissymmetry factors (|glum| up to 1.2 &#215; 10&#8722;3) and brightnesses (BCPL up to 26.3 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1), as well as excellent fluorescence quantum yields, demonstrating the Tr&#246;ger&#180;s base core to be a convenient scaffold to prepare CPL emitters upon functionalization with simple achiral fluorophores. Furthermore, the configurationally stable ethano&#8208;bridged Tr&#246;ger's base analogs are employed to modulate their CPL response, generating a CPL switch through their protonation/deprotonation by consecutive additions of acid and base. The reversibility of the switching process is demonstrated for two cycles without altering the CPL performance of the molecule. It is believed that this straightforward and efficient approach to building CPL emitters employing the Tr&#246;ger's base core could lead to its incorporation in CPL&#8208;based sensors and materials.

         <title>Acoustic Moir&#233; Flat Bands in Twisted Heterobilayer Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research proposes a heterobilayer moir&#233; acoustic metasurface using two distinct lattice structures. The heterobilayer design contributes to divergent dispersion curves for the upper and lower layers and allows for greater flexibility in tuning their hybridization through interlayer twisting. This metasurface enables tunable magic angles and topological states, significantly broadening the potential applications of acoustic wave manipulation.








Abstract
Twisted bilayer systems enable a fundamental platform for engineering novel physical phenomena, such as topological phase transitions, polaritons, flat bands, and superconductivity. However, previous reports mainly focused on homobilayer structures, where each layer has identical configurations. In this work, a twisted heterobilayer (tHB) metasurface with strong anisotropy is presented. It is shown that hybridizing the dispersion curves of two different profiles significantly enhances the application potential of bilayer structures. It is observed that when two stacked heterogeneous metasurfaces are rotated to a specific angle, a topological phase transition occurs, which is accompanied by hyperbolic to elliptical wave propagation characteristics. At a specific &#8220;magic angle&#8221;, the dispersion curves of the two layers merge into a flat band with drastically reduced diffraction, enabling sound waves to propagate with minimal energy dissipation. Furthermore, the performance of the tHB system is robust to defects or disorders, manifested by minimal changes before and after introducing line defects into the layers. Our findings overcome the limitations of homogeneous metasurface and provide new ideas for controlling sound&#8208;material interactions.

         <title>Mechanochromic, Low&#8208;Cost, and Structurally Colored Displays Using Biodegradable Hydroxypropyl Cellulose</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochromic hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) integrated with microfluidic devices creates scalable, eco&#8208;friendly reflective color displays. We demonstrate mechanochromic displays with 500 &#181;m pixel size and 5Hz switching rates with room for optimisation. The proposed mechanochromic HPC displays are an initial step toward more environmentally responsible color display and pixel technologies.








Abstract
Mechanochromic materials have garnered significant interest over the past decade due to their ability to change color in response to mechanical cues. While it is known that hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) self&#8208;assembles into biodegradable and low&#8208;cost mechanochromic materials, with a wide range of applications from edible colorants to optical strain sensors, mechanochromic HPC displays themselves are not reported. Here we address this challenge by combining thin mechanochromic HPC films with microfluidic arrays of inflatable microactuators that exert controlled forces. With these devices, the mechanochromic strain sensitivity, color resolution, response times, and operating frequencies of photonic aqueous HPC films are measured at decreasing length scales for the first time. Various pixel sizes, geometry, and input frequencies are also assessed to investigate mechanochromic HPC as a potential low&#8208;cost, biodegradable display. Potential applications range from dynamic color pixels for soft robotics to more environmentally responsible RGB display technology.

         <title>Electric&#8208;Field&#8208;Driven Reversal of Ferromagnetism in (110)&#8208;Oriented, Single Phase, Multiferroic Co&#8208;Substituted BiFeO3 Thin Films</title>

         <dc:description>
Electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced magnetization reversal is a long&#8208;sought&#8208;after achievement in materials engineering for use in next&#8208;generation, ultra&#8208;low power consumption memory devices. This work demonstrates fully electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven switching of the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane component of magnetization in (110)&#8208;oriented Co&#8208;substituted BiFeO3 thin films at room temperature, enabled through careful engineering of thin film boundary conditions and crystallography.








Abstract
While multiferroic materials are attractive systems for the promise of ultra&#8208;low&#8208;power&#8208;consumption computational technologies, electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced magnetization reversal is a key challenge for realizing devices at scale. Though significant research efforts have been working toward the realization of a material which couples ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism, there are few, even composite, systems which are practical for device scale applications at room temperature. Co&#8208;substituted multiferroic BiFe0.9Co0.1O3 is a promising candidate system, due to coupled ferroelectricity and weak ferromagnetism at room temperature. Here, it is theoretically indicated that the ferroic orders in this material are statically coupled, where an in&#8208;plane 109&#176; ferroelectric switching event can result in the reversal of this out&#8208;of&#8208;plane component of magnetization, and the electric field&#8208;induced magnetization reversal is experimentally observed. Such an in&#8208;plane poling configuration is particularly desirable for device applications.

         <title>Characterization and Inverse Design of Stochastic Mechanical Metamaterials Using Neural Operators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a DeepONet&#8208;based machine learning framework for designing stochastic mechanical metamaterials with tailored nonlinear mechanical properties. By leveraging sparse but high&#8208;quality experimental data from in situ micro&#8208;mechanical tests, high predictive accuracy and enable efficient inverse design are achieved. This approach integrates experimental mechanics and AI, advancing next&#8208;generation metamaterials for aerospace, healthcare, and energy applications.








Abstract
Machine learning (ML) is emerging as a transformative tool for the design of mechanical metamaterials, offering properties that far surpass those achievable through lab&#8208;based trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methods. However, a major challenge in current inverse design strategies is their reliance on extensive computational and/or experimental datasets, which becomes particularly problematic for designing micro&#8208;scale stochastic architected materials that exhibit nonlinear mechanical behaviors. Here, a comprehensive end&#8208;to&#8208;end scientific ML framework, leveraging deep neural operators (including DeepONet and its variants) is introduced, to directly learn the relationship between the complete microstructure and mechanical response of architected metamaterials from sparse but high&#8208;quality in situ experimental data. Various neural operators and standard neural networks are systematically compared to identify the model that offers better interpretability and accuracy. The approach facilitates the efficient inverse design of structures tailored to specific nonlinear mechanical behaviors. Results obtained from stochastic spinodal microstructures, printed using two&#8208;photon lithography, reveal that the prediction error for mechanical responses is within a range of 5 &#8208; 10%. This work underscores that by employing neural operators with advanced nano&#8208; and micro&#8208;mechanical experiments, the design of complex micro&#8208;architected materials with desired properties becomes feasible, even in scenarios constrained by data scarcity. This work marks a significant advancement in the field of materials&#8208;by&#8208;design, potentially heralding a new era in the discovery and development of next&#8208;generation metamaterials with unparalleled mechanical characteristics derived directly from experimental&#160;insights.

         <title>Mechanical Resonant Sensing of Spin Texture Dynamics in a 2D Antiferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detection of antiferromagnetic spin texture in a 2D magnetic crystal is achieved through nanomechanical resonators at radio frequencies. Sharp magnetic transitions that lead to abrupt changes in mechanical linear and nonlinear responses are assigned to antiferromagnetic domain motions. The results indicate rich and fluid&#8208;like dynamics between the coupled spin and lattice at the transition field.








Abstract
The coupling between the spin degrees of freedom and macroscopic mechanical motions, including striction, shearing, and rotation, has attracted wide interest with applications in actuation, transduction, and information processing. Experiments so far have established the mechanical responses to the long&#8208;range ordered or isolated single spin states. However, it remains elusive whether mechanical motions can couple to a different type of magnetic structure, the non&#8208;collinear spin textures, which exhibit nanoscale spatial variations of spin (domain walls, skyrmions, etc.) and are promising candidates to realize high&#8208;speed computing devices. Here, collective spin texture dynamics is detected with nanoelectromechanical resonators fabricated from&#160;2D antiferromagnetic (AFM) MnPS3 with 10&#8722;9 strain sensitivity. By examining radio frequency mechanical oscillations under magnetic fields, new magnetic transitions are identified with sharp dips in resonant frequency. They are attributed to collective AFM domain wall motions as supported by the analytical modeling of magnetostriction and large&#8208;scale spin&#8208;dynamics simulations. Additionally, an abnormally large modulation in the mechanical nonlinearity at the transition field infers a fluid&#8208;like response due to ultrafast domain motion. The work establishes a strong coupling between spin texture and mechanical dynamics, laying the foundation for electromechanical manipulation of spin texture and developing quantum hybrid devices.

Here, collective spin texture dynamics is detected with nanoelectromechanical resonators fabricated from&#160;2D antiferromagnetic (AFM) MnPS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;9&lt;/sup&gt; strain sensitivity. By examining radio frequency mechanical oscillations under magnetic fields, new magnetic transitions are identified with sharp dips in resonant frequency. They are attributed to collective AFM domain wall motions as supported by the analytical modeling of magnetostriction and large-scale spin-dynamics simulations. Additionally, an abnormally large modulation in the mechanical nonlinearity at the transition field infers a fluid-like response due to ultrafast domain motion. The work establishes a strong coupling between spin texture and mechanical dynamics, laying the foundation for electromechanical manipulation of spin texture and developing quantum hybrid devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlled Formation of Skyrmion Bags</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates stabilization of complex magnetic skyrmion bags in ferromagnetic thin films through precisely engineered anisotropy defects using ion irradiation. The researchers achieve controlled field&#8208; and laser&#8208;induced generation of skyrmionia, target skyrmions, and higher&#8208;order skyrmion bags at room temperature. This reliable platform opens opportunities for studying the dynamics of these topological textures and their implementation in advanced spintronic devices.








Abstract
Topologically non&#8208;trivial magnetic solitons are complex spin textures with a distinct single&#8208;particle nature. Although magnetic skyrmions, especially those with unity topological charge, have attracted substantial interest due to their potential applications, more complex topological textures remain largely theoretical. In this work, the stabilization of isolated higher&#8208;order skyrmion bags beyond the prototypical &#960;&#8208;skyrmion in ferromagnetic thin films is experimentally demonstrate, which has posed considerable challenges to date. Specifically, controlled generation of skyrmionium (2&#960;&#8208;skyrmion), target skyrmion (3&#960;&#8208;skyrmion), and skyrmion bags (with variable topological charge) are achieved through the introduction of artificially engineered anisotropy defects via local ion irradiation. They act as preferential sites for the field&#8208; or laser&#8208;induced nucleation of skyrmion bags. Remarkably, ultrafast laser pulses achieve a substantially higher conversion rate transforming skyrmions into higher&#8208;order skyrmion bags compared to their formation driven by magnetic fields. High&#8208;resolution x&#8208;ray imaging enables direct observation of the resulting skyrmion bags. Complementary micromagnetic simulations reveal the pivotal role of defect geometry&#8211;particularly diameter&#8211;in stabilizing closed&#8208;loop domain textures. The findings not only broaden the experimental horizon for skyrmion research, but also suggest strategies for exploiting complex topological spin textures within a unified material platform for practical&#160;applications.

         <title>In Situ Tailored Frustrated Lewis Pairs on Asymmetric Bi&#9472;Ov&#9472;In Motifs Domino&#8208;Direct High&#8208;Efficiency Urea Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A domino&#8208;oriented electrosynthesis strategy to access urea of unprecedented selectivity from CO2 and NO3&#8722; is implemented over a Bi&#8208;doped In2O3 catalyst with asymmetric Bi&#9472;Ov&#9472;In sites. The kinetically preferred NO3RR driving the tandem CO2 activation and C&#9472;N coupling by in situ tailored controllable SFLPs (Bi&#9472;Ov&#9472;In&#9472;NH2) to complete urea electrosynthesis does not involve CO2RR.








Abstract
The green urea synthesis via co&#8208;electrolysis of waste nitrate and CO2 is alluring but challenging, especially with insufficient selectivity caused by thermodynamic differences and kinetic mismatch between multi&#8208;step conversion processes. Here, a domino effect&#8208;oriented electrosynthesis strategy is showcased to steer cascade reactions in upgrading nitrate and CO2 toward urea of high selectivity on Bi&#8208;doped In2O3 with asymmetric oxygen vacancies (Ov). The conventionally arbitrary reaction mode can be vectored and re&#8208;customized by stable and cumulative *NH2 intermediates in situ derived from priority nitrate reduction reaction, which not only form surface frustrated Lewis pairs (SFLPs, Bi&#9472;Ov&#9472;In&#9472;NH2) with Bi Lewis acid sites to synergistically adsorb and activate CO2 but also provide more opportunities for sluggish C&#9472;N coupling, delivering an unprecedented urea Faradic efficiency of 80.2% and an impressive urea yield of 2.38 &#215; 103&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.4&#160;V versus RHE. The atomically dispersed Bi sites promote the protonation of *NO to form nucleophilic *NH2 intermediates, which can be stabilized in the electrophilic region mediated by asymmetric Ov, permitting two nucleophilic attacks to complete the C&#9472;N coupling. The domino modeling protocol via positioning a specific intermediate in situ tailors the parallel conversion process and may guide selectivity control of electrosynthesis.

         <title>Strain Gradient Induced Skyrmion in a van der Waals Magnet by Wrinkling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 enables field&#8208;free skyrmion generation via wrinkling&#8208;induced deformation. The opposing in&#8208;plane strain gradients across the wrinkle's peak/valley drive asymmetric domain evolution: skyrmion nucleation occurs on one flank while labyrinthine domain patterns persist on the counterpart. This asymmetry originates from strain&#8208;gradient&#8208;mediated differential modulation of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction.








Abstract
Magnetic structures are profoundly influenced by mechanical deformation. In particular, strain has been employed to achieve the reconstruction of magnetic domains, paving a mechanical pathway to manipulate magnetic domains. However, experimentally applied strains typically exhibit non&#8208;uniform distributions. Therefore, how to distinguish the role of non&#8208;uniform strains (strain gradients) and uniform strains is crucial for understanding the mechanical manipulation of magnetic structures. Here, by directly comparing to strain tuning, it is revealed that strain gradient induced by mechanical wrinkles is critical for magnetic domain manipulation in van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2. A ground&#8208;state labyrinthine domain transforms into a skyrmion state in the presence of an in&#8208;plane strain gradient. Additionally, an asymmetric evolutionary behavior of the magnetic domain occurs on both sides of wrinkle peaks. Theoretical simulations uncover that though opposite in&#8208;plane strain gradient hosts C2 rotational symmetry, this asymmetric domain evolution can be achieved through the coupling of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction. The finding highlights the vital role of strain gradient in manipulating magnetic properties, and also offers a new mechanism for generating field&#8208;free skyrmion.

         <title>Suppression of Tin Oxidation via Sn&#8594;B Bonding Interactions for High&#8208;Resolution Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Neuromorphic Imaging Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boric acid&#8208;added 2D layered tin&#8208;based perovskite ((4&#8208;Cl&#8208;PEA)2SnI4) films utilize new Sn&#8594;B donor&#8208;acceptor interactions to suppress Sn2+ oxidation, resulting in reduced nonradiative recombination, low trap density, and high uniformity. This enables a vertical optoelectronic synapse with excellent synaptic performance. Finally, a high&#8208;resolution neuromorphic imaging array for image recognition, memory, and processing surpasses traditional image sensors.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;free tin&#8208;based perovskites, specifically (4&#8208;Cl&#8208;PEA)2SnI4, possess significant potential for the development of high&#8208;performance, robust neuromorphic imaging sensors, owing to their superior optoelectronic properties and compatibility with conventional complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor fabrication techniques and silicon&#8208;based readout circuits. However, the excessive oxidation of Sn2+ remains a significant obstacle, leading to suboptimal synaptic performance and low resolution in the neuromorphic imaging sensors due to increased recombination losses and poor film uniformity. This study first demonstrates that the introduction of novel Sn&#8594;B donor&#8211;acceptor bonding interactions effectively suppresses Sn2+ oxidation, enhancing uniformity, reducing nonradiative recombination, and improving synaptic plasticity. A vertical optoelectronic synapse demonstrates diverse synaptic behaviors, attributed to hole trapping and detrapping at the device interface. Additionally, the device enables applications in associative learning, neuromorphic computation, letter encoding, and handwritten digit recognition. Ultimately, integration with silicon circuits results in a high&#8208;resolution (32 &#215; 32) neuromorphic imaging array, one of the highest reported resolutions for perovskite optoelectronic synapse arrays. The improved uniformity of boric acid&#8208;added (4&#8208;Cl&#8208;PEA)2SnI4 perovskite films significantly reduces photo response non&#8208;uniformity, enhances resolution, and improves memory capabilities. This neuromorphic imaging array successfully integrates sensing, storage, and computation, enabling advanced functionalities like letter recognition, memory, and processing, surpassing conventional image sensors.

&lt;p&gt;Boric acid-added 2D layered tin-based perovskite ((4-Cl-PEA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SnI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) films utilize new Sn&#8594;B donor-acceptor interactions to suppress Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oxidation, resulting in reduced nonradiative recombination, low trap density, and high uniformity. This enables a vertical optoelectronic synapse with excellent synaptic performance. Finally, a high-resolution neuromorphic imaging array for image recognition, memory, and processing surpasses traditional image sensors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead-free tin-based perovskites, specifically (4-Cl-PEA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SnI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, possess significant potential for the development of high-performance, robust neuromorphic imaging sensors, owing to their superior optoelectronic properties and compatibility with conventional complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor fabrication techniques and silicon-based readout circuits. However, the excessive oxidation of Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; remains a significant obstacle, leading to suboptimal synaptic performance and low resolution in the neuromorphic imaging sensors due to increased recombination losses and poor film uniformity. This study first demonstrates that the introduction of novel Sn&#8594;B donor&#8211;acceptor bonding interactions effectively suppresses Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oxidation, enhancing uniformity, reducing nonradiative recombination, and improving synaptic plasticity. A vertical optoelectronic synapse demonstrates diverse synaptic behaviors, attributed to hole trapping and detrapping at the device interface. Additionally, the device enables applications in associative learning, neuromorphic computation, letter encoding, and handwritten digit recognition. Ultimately, integration with silicon circuits results in a high-resolution (32 &#215; 32) neuromorphic imaging array, one of the highest reported resolutions for perovskite optoelectronic synapse arrays. The improved uniformity of boric acid-added (4-Cl-PEA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SnI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite films significantly reduces photo response non-uniformity, enhances resolution, and improves memory capabilities. This neuromorphic imaging array successfully integrates sensing, storage, and computation, enabling advanced functionalities like letter recognition, memory, and processing, surpassing conventional image sensors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Multilayered Concentric Supraparticle Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces Self&#8208;Assembled Multilayered Supraparticle (SAMS), the first concentric lamellar spherical structures formed from synergistic interactions between gold nanoparticles, lipidoid, and gelatin. SAMS exhibits unique interlayer spacing, enabling efficient environment responsive delivery of labile payloads like siRNA and mRNA. This work advances complex supraparticle design leveraging self&#8208;limiting self&#8208;assembly and demonstrates potential applications in nanomedicine.








Abstract
Supraparticles (SPs) with unique properties are emerging as versatile platforms for applications in catalysis, photonics, and medicine. However, the synthesis of novel SPs with complex internal structures remains a challenge. Self&#8208;Assembled Multilayered Supraparticles (SAMS) presented here are composed of concentric lamellar spherical structures made from metallic nanoparticles, formed from a synergistic three&#8208;way interaction phenomenon between gold nanoparticles, lipidoid, and gelatin, exhibiting interlayer spacing of 3.5&#160; &#177;&#160;0.2&#160;nm within a self&#8208;limited 156.8&#160; &#177;&#160;56.6&#160;nm diameter. The formation is critically influenced by both physical (including nanoparticle size, lipidoid chain length) and chemical factors (including elemental composition, nanoparticle cap, and organic material), which collectively modulate the surface chemistry and hydrophobicity, affecting interparticle interactions. SAMS can efficiently deliver labile payloads such as siRNA, achieving dose&#8208;dependent silencing in vivo, while also showing potential for complex payloads such as mRNA. This work not only advances the field of SP design by introducing a new structure and interaction phenomenon but also demonstrates its potential in nanomedicine.

         <title>Fluoroethylene Carbonate&#8208;Enabled Gel Polymer Electrolyte for Stable High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The triangular synergistic strategy employed in the designed hybrid gel polymer electrolyte (HGPE) enhances Li+&#160;transport in FEC, inhibits electrolyte oxidation and decomposition on the NCM811 cathode, and facilitates the formation of a LiDFOB&#8208;derived mixed cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase (CEI) layer at the interface, thereby enabling stable cycling of Li||NCM811 quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state cells for 400 cycles at 4.5 V.








Abstract
The stable operation of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) at high voltages is currently limited by&#160;the performance of conventional electrolytes. Fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) exhibits unique physicochemical properties that positively impact interfacial chemistry, positioning it as a promising candidate to enhance the performance of LMBs. However, FEC is prone to the formation of corrosive HF under high voltage, which leads to the degradation of&#160;electrode interface. In this study, a hybrid gel polymer electrolyte (HGPE) based on pure FEC solvent with pentafluorophenyl methacrylate (PFPMA) monomer is presented to extend the voltage operating range. The PFPMA monomer forms a mixed&#8208;layer solid electrolyte interphase with lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB) on electrode surface, effectively inhibiting the decomposition of FEC. The triangular synergistic strategy involving FEC, PFPMA, and polymer segments improves the transport of&#160;Li ions&#160;in FEC, achieving&#160;a high Li+&#160;transference number of 0.87. The designed electrolyte demonstrates good compatibility with Li metal and stabilizes&#160;LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2&#160;(NCM811) cathodes. As&#160;a result, the Li||NCM811 battery based&#160;HGPE exhibits a capacity retention of 83.4% after 300 cycles and 74.2% after 400 cycles, under a cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5&#160;V. This study provides a promising strategy for the development of GPE for high&#8208;voltage LMBs applications.

         <title>Effects of Interfacial Adhesion on Lithium Plating Location in Solid&#8208;State Batteries with Carbon Interlayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon interlayers can promote the stable cycling of anode&#8208;free solid&#8208;state batteries, but their underlying mechanisms have remained elusive. In this study, a direct correlation is observed between the interfacial adhesion of the carbon interlayer and the location of lithium plating. By conducting quantitative peel tests, a threshold interfacial toughness is found to be a determining factor that directs plating toward specific interfaces.








Abstract
Carbon interlayers have been implemented in &#8220;anode&#8208;free&#8221; solid&#8208;state batteries to improve the uniformity and reversibility of lithium deposition by controlling the location of Li plating. However, there remains a lack of fundamental understanding of the detailed role of how these interlayers function during in situ Li formation. In this study, the relationships between the interfacial adhesion of the carbon interlayer to the solid electrolyte and the location of Li plating are investigated. By varying the lamination pressure used during manufacturing, the ability to systematically tune the resulting interfacial adhesion is demonstrated. Mechanical peel tests are performed, and a 4&#8208;fold increase in interfacial toughness is measured as the lamination pressure increases from 100 to 400&#160;MPa. Post&#8208;mortem electron microscopy revealed that the location of Li plating with respect to the carbon interlayer transitions from the interface with the solid electrolyte to the current collector above a threshold interfacial toughness, which is consistent when the interlayer material is changed from amorphous to hard carbon. These findings highlight the role of electro&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical relationships in systematically controlling Li deposition in solid&#8208;state batteries when interlayers are present.

         <title>All&#8208;Optically Modulated In&#8208;Sensor Computing Device Based on Ionic&#8208;Conducting CuInP2Se6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;optical in&#8208;sensor computing device is presented based on the unique optoelectronic and ion&#8208;conducting properties of two&#8208;dimensional material CuInP2Se6. Light intensity&#8208;adaptive modulation of ionic conductivity is achieved within the 400 to 700 nm wavelength range. This architecture provides a novel solution in RGB&#8208;noise image processing and recognition by leveraging the intricate ion&#8208;electron coupling effect.








Abstract
Inspired by the human visual system, in&#8208;sensor computing has emerged as a promising approach to address growing demands for real&#8208;time image processing while overcoming constraints in computational resources. However, existing in&#8208;sensor computing optoelectronic devices still face challenges such as complex heterostructures or limited optical modulation for operational efficiency, restricting their practical use. Here, a simple two&#8208;terminal optoelectronic device has been fabricated using the 2D material CuInP2Se6, achieving neuromorphic functionalities through all&#8208;optical modulation. The device exhibits a tunable photoresponse across the visible spectrum (400 to 700 nm) and enables bidirectional conductance modulation in response to light stimuli, driven by the interaction between Cu&#8314; ions and photogenerated electrons. It shows high linearity with 300 discrete conductance states under red, green, and blue light, enabling color&#8208;specific image feature extraction, processing, and recognition across three channels. This approach significantly enhances color image recognition accuracy by 4.6% when integrated with a three&#8208;channel convolutional neural network. Additionally, the bidirectional photoresponse allows for efficient noise suppression during color image preprocessing, leading to a 490% improvement in signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. These findings highlight the potential of CuInP2Se6&#8208;based architecture for robust performance, paving the way for in&#8208;sensor neuromorphic vision systems in artificial intelligence and biomimetic computing.

It shows high linearity with 300 discrete conductance states under red, green, and blue light, enabling color-specific image feature extraction, processing, and recognition across three channels. This approach significantly enhances color image recognition accuracy by 4.6% when integrated with a three-channel convolutional neural network. Additionally, the bidirectional photoresponse allows for efficient noise suppression during color image preprocessing, leading to a 490% improvement in signal-to-noise ratio. These findings highlight the potential of CuInP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-based architecture for robust performance, paving the way for in-sensor neuromorphic vision systems in artificial intelligence and biomimetic computing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

LIBs used for aviation exhibit rapid aging and shortened service life due to the harsh conditions of aviation, posing significant risks to flight safety. This study reveals the degradation mechanisms and quantifies the relative impact of temperature and pressure factors, providing critical insights for optimizing future electric aircraft battery designs.








Abstract
The widespread adoption of electric vehicles has spurred the exploration of airworthy lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) for electric&#8208;powered aircraft. However, LIBs used for aviation exhibit rapid aging and shortened service life due to the harsh conditions of aviation, posing significant risks to flight safety. In this study, a comprehensive analysis is conducted under simulated flight conditions to reveal the degradation mechanism of aviation batteries. Low&#8208;temperature and low&#8208;pressure lead to a sluggish kinetics and hinder thermodynamic process. As the reversibility of Li&#8208;ions insertion and extraction is deteriorates, residual Li&#8208;ions accumulate and plated&#8208;Li on the anode, accelerating the aging process and arising the issue of internal short circuits. Additionally, the interatomic distance of Ni&#8208;coordination induces significant stress variations, which drives an expanded occupation of porosity in the electrode under flight conditions, with 2.13% void spaces of cathode and 13.39% of anode. The formation and growth of cracks elongate the charge transfer pathway, increasing resistance and reducing rate capability. As a result, this study quantifies the degradation mechanisms of aviation batteries and establishes the relative impact weights of temperature and pressure factors, offering critical insights for optimizing future electric aircraft power battery designs.

         <title>Icing on the Cake: Integrating Optical Fiber with Second Near&#8208;Infrared Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogen for Exceptional Phototheranostics of Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By elaborate electron donor/&#960;&#8208;bridge manipulation, a versatile NIR&#8208;II AIE luminogen is constructed. Experimental and theoretical studies both demonstrate that the AIE luminogen is unambiguously advantageous to implement optical fiber&#8208;mediated treatment of bladder cancer under the guidance of NIR&#8208;II fluorescent&#8208;photoacoustic&#8208;photothermal trimodal imaging.








Abstract
Bladder cancer is a common urological malignancy characterized by high morbidity, high recurrence rate and high mortality, imposing heavy burdens on patients mentally and financially. The research pioneers a diagnostic and therapeutic approach that integrates a second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) multimodal phototheranostic platform with optical fiber&#8208;mediated interventional phototherapy strategy, to implement a comprehensive diagnosis and &#8220;inside&#8208;out&#8221; treatment of bladder cancer. The proposed molecule, namely BTO&#8208;TTQ, is elaborately designed through electron donor/&#960;&#8208;bridge engineering and demonstrates satisfying NIR&#8208;II emission with aggregation&#8208;induced emission features, high photothermal conversion efficiency, and prominent generation of type I reactive oxygen species. Quantum chemical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations are employed to deeply elucidate the energy dissipation pathways of the excited state and the impact of intramolecular motion on their photophysical properties. Furthermore, under the guidance of NIR&#8208;II fluorescent&#8208;photoacoustic&#8208;photothermal trimodal imaging, hyaluronic acid&#8208;modified BTO&#8208;TTQ nanoparticles exhibit exceptional performance in optical fiber&#8208;mediated interventional phototherapy for air&#8208;pouch bladder cancer models. This study thus brings a new insight into the development of superior versatile phototheranostics for clinical theranostics of bladder cancer.

         <title>Electrochromic Smart Windows with On&#8208;Demand Photothermal Regulation for Energy&#8208;Saving Buildings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
WO3//MnO2&#8208;based electrochromic smart windows with highly selective visible and near&#8208;infrared regulation are achieved by decoupling the mechanisms of reversible deposition and ion adsorption. It is found that the hybrid Cu2+/Mn2+ ions promote proton adsorption while hampering proton insertion on the WO3 surface for the first time, endowing the windows with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art properties.








Abstract
Electrochromic smart windows with dynamic photothermal management can enhance living comfort and reduce building energy consumption. However, they usually suffer from low selectivity and optical modulation in visible (VIS) and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) regions owing to the coupled mechanism restriction. Here, the reversible deposition and ion adsorption in WO3//MnO2&#8208;based smart windows are decoupled using a hybrid electrolyte, realizing their independent and efficient VIS&#8211;NIR regulation. The Cu2+/Mn2+ ions in the hybrid electrolyte enhance proton adsorption on the WO3 surface while impeding proton insertion, imparting state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NIR regulation to the WO3 electrode. Moreover, the synergy of protons and Cu2+/Mn2+ ions facilitates reversible MnO2 electrodeposition on the electrode, triggering independent tuning of VIS light with an optical modulation of 94%. The outdoor test and simulation reveal that the smart window achieves cooling at 5&#8211;10&#160;&#176;C, an energy savings of 73.2&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;2 and a reduction of 14.4&#160;kg of CO2 emissions per square meter of the building annually. This work would contribute to energy&#8208;saving and emission&#8208;reduction solutions in widespread applications.

         <title>Ultrafast Light&#8208;Driven Electronic and Structural Changes in LaFeO3 Perovskites Probed by Femtosecond X&#8208;Ray Absorption Spectroscopy</title>

Femtosecond X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (fs&#8208;XAS) at PAL&#8208;XFEL captures ultrafast electronic and structural dynamics in epitaxial LaFeO3 thin films. Combined with DFT and multiplet calculations, the study reveals photoinduced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer, followed by polaron formation and reduced oxygen 2p&#8208;iron 3d hybridization, explaining key spectral changes.








Abstract
Conducting real&#8208;time, element&#8208;specific studies of photo&#8208;excited systems is a long&#8208;standing challenge. The development of X&#8208;ray free&#8208;electron lasers (XFELs) has paved the way for the emergence of a promising technique: femtosecond X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (fs&#8208;XAS). This powerful technique reveals electronic and geometric characteristics, providing unprecedented insight into their dynamic interactions under nonequilibrium conditions. Herein, the&#160;fs&#8208;XAS technique is employed at PAL&#8208;XFEL to unravel light&#8208;driven ultrafast electronic and structural changes in epitaxial lanthanum iron oxide (LaFeO3) thin films. Density functional theory (DFT) and multiplet calculations are utilized to expound on the experimental results. The analyses reveal that photoexcitation initially induces high&#8208; and intermediate&#8208;spin Fe2+ states through ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT), followed by polaron formation. It is demonstrated that the reduced overlap between the oxygen 2p and iron 3d orbitals accounts for all experimental observations, including 1) the XAS shifts to lower energies, 2) the decrease in the crystal field splitting, and 3) the relatively larger shifts observed in the oxygen 1s XAS.

         <title>Friction Tuning of Interlayer Exciton Recombination in Van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is revealed how friction alters exciton dynamics in MoS&#8322;/WS&#8322; heterostructures. Using time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence combined with atomic force microscope, it is shown that friction&#8208;induced defects shorten interlayer exciton lifetimes by trapping electrons, which increases friction by affecting charge density evolution in turn. Density functional theory calculations confirm this mechanism, offering new insight into energy dissipation in nano&#8208;opto&#8208;electromechanical systems.








Abstract
Van der Waals heterostructures combine low friction with excellent optoelectronic properties, making them suitable for opto&#8208;nano&#8208;electromechanical systems. While the long lifetime of interlayer excitons in these materials helps reduce energy loss, friction in mechanical systems is unavoidable and can shorten the exciton recombination lifetime, undermining the low&#8208;friction benefits. Despite its importance, the fundamental mechanism underlying friction&#8208;induced changes in exciton recombination remains unexplored, mainly due to the difficulty of probing long&#8208;lifetime exciton recombination at friction interfaces. Here, time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence combined with an atomic force microscope is used to detect exciton recombination at the friction interface of MoS2/WS2 heterostructures. The findings show that friction generates defects, which trap electrons and create additional recombination pathways, shortening exciton recombination lifetimes. This, in turn, increases friction by altering charge density evolution and raising the friction sliding barrier. Density functional theory calculations confirm this mechanism. These results reveal how friction influences exciton recombination, paving the way for advancements in low&#8208;friction nano&#8208;opto&#8208;electromechanical devices.

         <title>Sandwich Engineering Advances Ductile Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative sandwich engineering is developed to realize n&#8208;type Ag2(S, Se)&#8208;Ag2Se ductile thermoelectric films, exhibiting a record&#8208;high thermoelectric performance near room&#8208;temperature among n&#8208;type ductile semiconductors. The as&#8208;fabricated in&#8208;plane F&#8208;TED achieves an exceptional power density of 26.5&#160;W m&#8722;2 at a temperature difference of 50 K, ranking among the highest for ductile TEDs, demonstrating promising application potential.








Abstract
Flexible thermoelectrics offer the possibility of utilizing human body heat to generate electricity, enabling self&#8208;powered wearable electronics. Ductile and plastic semiconductors are promising materials for flexible thermoelectrics due to their inherent ductility and tunable electrical properties. However, balancing ductility with high thermoelectric performance remains challenging, especially for n&#8208;type materials. Here, a novel n&#8208;type ductile Ag2(S, Se)&#8208;Ag2Se sandwich&#8208;like thermoelectric film is designed with different functional layers, where the Ag2(S, Se) core layer provides ductile deformation ability and low thermal conductivity, while epitaxially grown highly oriented Ag2Se shell layers ensure superior electrical transport performance. This architecture achieves a record high figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit near room&#8208;temperature range, 0.91 at 323 K, among n&#8208;type ductile semiconductors while preserving excellent flexibility. Additionally, a flexible in&#8208;plane device fabricated from this material delivers an exceptional power density of 26.5&#160;W m&#8722;2 at a temperature difference of 50 K, demonstrating its great application potential for wearable electronics. Importantly, such novel sandwich engineering can pave the way to alleviate the compromise between thermoelectric performance and ductility in inorganic semiconductors.

         <title>Ionic Liquid&#8208;Reinforced Multifunctional Hydrogel for the Treatment of Enterocutaneous Fistula</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ECFGel is a multifunctional hydrogel engineered to treat infection&#8208;associated ECFs. ECFGel demonstrates outstanding mechanical and biological properties, facilitating easy application, reliable occlusion, and sterilization, while promoting effective healing of infected fistula tracts. A choline and geranate&#8208;based ionic liquid hydrogel is used to concurrently enhance mechanical performance and confer antimicrobial functionality.








Abstract
Enterocutaneous fistulas (ECFs) profoundly impact patients&#8217; quality of life, contributing to high morbidity rates and increased mortality due to ineffective treatment options. To address this challenge, ECFGel, a multifunctional, tissue adhesive injectable hydrogel, designed to occlude, sterilize, and promote healing of ECF tracts, is developed. ECFGel is formulated using gelatin and oxidized dextran (O&#8208;Dex) as base components, which form chemical crosslinks within the hydrogel and with surrounding biological tissues, ensuring tissue adhesiveness. A choline and geranate&#8208;based ionic liquid (IL) is incorporated to provide dual functionality, potent antimicrobial activity, and mechanical enhancement. By optimizing IL concentration, ECFGel achieves rapid gelation, enhanced mechanical strength, and improved elastic recoverability. Additionally, iohexol (IOH) is added for radiopacity, enabling real&#8208;time imaging and further strengthening the hydrogel's mechanical properties. ECFGel demonstrates antiswelling properties, biodegradability, and effective tract occlusion in porcine soft tissues. It shows strong antimicrobial activity against highly resistant, patient&#8208;derived pathogens isolated from clinical ECF cases. In a porcine perianal fistula model, ECFGel enables rapid occlusion and complete healing, promoting tissue maturation, reducing bacterial load, and increasing markers of cell proliferation and vascularization compared to untreated controls. These promising results highlight ECFGel's potential as a new therapeutic option for treating infected ECFs.

         <title>Built&#8208;in Electric Field in Ru/CoP Bifunctional Electrocatalyst Enhances Hydrazine&#8208;Assisted Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of Ru/CoP heterostructure induces interfacial interaction, which mitigates the strong adsorption of *H on Ru sites while promoting hydrogen spillover and enhancing *H coverage on Co sites. Moreover, the adsorption of N2H4 is improved on Ru sites. This Ru/CoP heterostructure greatly improves the bifunctional electrocatalytic activity of HER and HzOR and realizes efficient and energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic hydrazine&#8208;assisted water splitting, incorporating the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR), offers a promising avenue for hydrogen production. Herein, a Ru/CoP heterostructure is introduced, which enhances bifunctional catalytic activity through interfacial interaction induced by the built&#8208;in electric field between Ru nanoparticles and CoP nanosheets. This interaction optimizes the adsorption of intermediates and facilitates improved HER performances by weakening the strong adsorption of active hydrogen species (*H) on Ru and enhancing *H coverage on CoP through hydrogen spillover. Additionally, this electron interaction promotes the adsorption of N2H4 and its subsequent dehydrogenation, vital for HzOR activity. The heterostructure's significant reduction in required potentials for both reactions underscores its efficiency and potential economic benefits over traditional systems. Furthermore, the study validates the feasibility of using this approach for practical applications in sustainable hydrogen production, emphasizing its lower operational costs and enhanced catalytic stability and activity. This work not only showcases the practical applications of Ru/CoP but also underscores the broader applicability of heterostructure strategy in designing efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome lysosomal barriers, an OVDS framework is provided features a fluorescence visualization unit, a drug&#8208;loading unit, and a mitochondria localization unit to switch HCPT from the lysosomal&#8208;to&#8208;mitochondrial localization, achieving targeted subcellular drug distribution and fundamentally solving the technical problem of tumor drug resistance, offering a promising tool for overcoming lysosome&#8208;mediated drug resistance in clinical oncology.








Abstract
The power of drugs lies in their ability to reach their target sites and remain in place for a sufficient duration to exert their therapeutic effects. However, for some drugs, lysosomal phagocytosis presents ongoing challenges. In this study, an engineered organelles visualization drug&#8208;delivery system (OVDS) is introduced as a subcellular drug visualization and redistribution framework that facilitates the movement of drug molecules from one organelle, specifically lysosomes, to another, such as the mitochondria. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, an OVDS is developed to facilitate the translocation of 10&#8208;hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) from the lysosomes to mitochondria. This modification of subcellular HCPT distribution allows the evasion of lysosome&#8208;mediated HCPT resistance in cancer cells. Unlike traditional chemotherapeutic approaches, when HCPT is incorporated into the OVDS framework (HCPT&#8208;OVDS), the positive charge of the OVDS facilitates protonation, thereby enabling HCPT to escape lysosomes and enter mitochondria. Using HCPT&#8208;OVDS, substantial drug accumulation is achieved at the target sites in HCPT&#8208;resistant cells, with up to 70 &#177; 6% efficient subcellular translocalization and a 12.8 fold enhancement in cytotoxicity. Overall, the HCPT&#8208;OVDS represents an innovative engineering framework for subcellular spatial redistribution and offers a promising solution for addressing cancer drug resistance.

         <title>Realizing Uniform Defect Passivation via Self&#8208;Polymerization of Benzenesulfonate Molecules in Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzenesulfonate monomers undergo&#160;in situ self&#8208;polymerization during the crystallization process of perovskite, providing more uniform passivation for perovskite defects than single molecules. The in situ formed polymer also facilitates the growth of large grain domains and the charge transport, offering an efficiency of 25.34% for small&#8208;area perovskite solar cells and 21.54% for mini&#8208;modules with an active area of 14.0 cm2.








Abstract
Realizing high&#8208;quality perovskite films through uniform defect passivation and crystallization control is pivotal to unlocking the potential of scalable applications. However, prevalent small&#8208;molecule additives are inherently susceptible to the crystallization dynamics of perovskites, resulting in non&#8208;uniform distribution within the crystalline film and impeding consistent passivation and precise crystallization control. While polymers offer improved uniformity, their poor solubility restricts practical applications. To overcome this limitation, an in situ self&#8208;polymerization strategy is employed, enabling homogeneous coordination between sulfonate&#8208;containing additives and undercoordinated lead cations. This approach enhances perovskite film quality, promotes larger crystalline grain domains, and facilitates more efficient charge transport across grain domain boundaries. As a result, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) achieve a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 25.34% in small&#8208;area devices and 21.54% in 14.0 cm2 mini&#8208;modules, accompanied by exceptional operational stability. These findings highlight in situ polymerization as an effective strategy for leveraging sulfonate additives to overcome distribution challenges, advancing the scalable fabrication of efficient and stable PSCs.

         <title>Formation Mechanism and Molecular Structure of Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation mechanism of SPAN begins with the production of the S2 diradical, followed by the dehydrogenation and cyclization of PAN, resulting in the formation of SPAN. Its molecular structure is multilayered, featuring two twisted layers (&#8776;30&#8211;40&#176;) interconnected by C&#9472;Sx&#9472;N bonds. This structure has the potential to chemically confine sulfur up to 63.5 wt.% (&#8776;1000 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1).








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries have attracted considerable attention due to their high theoretical energy density and abundant sulfur resources. Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) effectively suppresses polysulfide dissolution and demonstrates excellent cycling stability, making it a promising candidate for cathode materials in practical Li&#8208;SPAN batteries. This study elucidates the formation mechanism, chemical bonds, and spatial structures of SPAN. The reaction begins with the generation of &#183;S2&#183; diradicals, followed by the dehydrogenation and cyclization of polyacrylonitrile (PAN), ultimately resulting in the formation of C&#9472;S and N&#9472;S bonds. The multilayered structure of SPAN, characterized by C&#8208;S and N&#8208;S layers twisted at angles of &#8776;30 to 40 degrees and interconnected by C&#9472;Sx&#9472;N bonds, has the potential to chemically confine sulfur up to a maximum of 63.5 wt.%, corresponding to a theoretical capacity exceeding 1000 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1. These findings provide fundamental insights for the design of SPAN materials for advanced X&#8208;SPAN batteries.

The development of ultra&#8208;soluble 1&#8208;azaphenothiazine (1&#8208;APT) marks a significant advancement in additive chemistry for high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2 cathodes, surpassing traditional additives and facilitating large&#8208;scale battery production. Li||LiCoO2&#8208;1&#8208;APT pouch cells demonstrate impressive performance with specific energies of 515.7, 497.4, and 484.9 Wh kg&#8722;1 at discharge rates of 0.5C, 1C, and 2C, respectively.








Abstract
High&#8208;voltage LiCoO2 is a promising cathode candidate for achieving high&#8208;energy lithium metal pouch cells. However, further application is still hindered by irreversible structural degradation and severe interfacial side reactions that accelerate capacity decay. Herein, 1&#8208;Azaphenothiazine (1&#8208;APT) is incorporated as a cathode slurry additive (1&#160;g mL&#8722;1 in N&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidone) to promote the optimization of the LiCoO2 interface during the electrode coating process. The ultra&#8208;soluble 1&#8208;APT promotes the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich components within the cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI), mitigates the reaction of Co4+ with the electrolyte, and enhances the interfacial stability of LiCoO2, thereby enabling 4.7&#160;V LiCoO2 with an initial capacity of 229.8 mAh g&#8722;1 and 73.2% capacity retention after 200 cycles. More importantly, Li||LiCoO2&#8208;1&#8208;APT pouch cells exhibit remarkable electrochemical performance, achieving specific energies of 515.7&#160;, 497.4&#160;, and 484.9&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at discharge rates of 0.5C, 1C, and 2C, respectively. Notably, the 5 Ah pouch cell exhibited the capability to maintain an energy density of 411.4&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 after 100 cycles at 0.5C. This work presents a practical and effective strategy for optimizing cathode interfaces, thereby enabling the stabilization of high&#8208;voltage cathodes.

The results are enabled by synergistic co&#8208;additives, which can manipulate nanograin crystallization and mitigate crystal defects effectively.








Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) compliant with Rec. 2020 standards have raised increasing attention for next&#8208;generation displays. As a class of pure&#8208;green emitters, the mixed&#8208;cation FAxCs1&#8208;xPbBr3 perovskites exhibit compatible band emission, but suffer from inferior luminescence performance. The approach to tackling this issue is hindered by a lack of in&#8208;depth understanding of their crystallization manipulating mechanism. This work unveils the crystallization process of mixed&#8208;cation FA0.7Cs0.45GA0.1PbBr3 perovskites, demonstrating the fast spontaneous growth readily induces severe crystal defects accompanied by poor charge confinement. This motivates us to introduce additional kinetic barriers to manipulate the perovskite crystallization via the synergistic co&#8208;additives of 3&#8208;((2&#8208;(methacryloyloxy)ethyldimethyl)ammonio)&#8208;propane&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonate (DMAPS) and 1,4,7,10,13,16&#8208;hexaoxacyclooctadecane (crown). The multifunctional groups in the co&#8208;additives afford robust chemical affinities with the diverse organic and inorganic precursor ions simultaneously, which enable decent nanograin growth with effective crystal defect healing and charge confinement. Ultimately, mixed&#8208;cation FA0.7Cs0.45GA0.1PbBr3 perovskites with a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 96% are achieved. The resultant pure&#8208;green PeLEDs with the Rec. 2020 compliance exhibit a champion external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 31.89%, average EQE of 29.5%, maximum luminance of 2 &#215; 105 cd&#160;m&#8722;2 and operational half&#8208;lifetime of 3.2 h at an initial luminance of 7000 cd&#160;m&#8722;2 (extrapolated: &#8776;3500 h at 100 cd&#160;m&#8722;2).

         <title>Linear Annulation Engineering of Indolocarbazole Multiple Resonance Emitter to Overcome Efficiency&#8208;Stability&#8208;Color Purity Trilemma in Deep&#8208;Blue OLEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An indolocarbazole emitter employing a linear annulation strategy is developed, not only narrowing spectral bandwidth with redshifted emission through multiple resonance framework extension to afford ultrapure electroluminescence peaking at 458&#160;nm with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 19&#160;nm, but also enhancing device longevity and efficiency with a long LT80 of 101&#160;h and high maximum external quantum efficiency of 34.3%.








Abstract
Deep&#8208;blue emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) still confront the critical challenge of balancing high efficiency, operational stability, and color purity, particularly for the ones with peak wavelengths (&#955;max) &#8804; 460&#160;nm. Here, the study demonstrates deep&#8208;blue devices featuring ultrapure emission (&#955;max = 458&#160;nm, full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum = 19&#160;nm), high maximum external quantum efficiency of 34.3% with small roll&#8208;off (26.9% at 1&#8201;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2; 20.9% at 5&#8201;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2), and long operational LT80 (time to 80% of the initial luminance) of 101 hours at 1,000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, being one of the longest lifetime among OLEDs with &#955;max &#8804; 460&#160;nm and EQE &gt;20%. This breakthrough stems from an indolocarbazole narrowband emitter employing a linear annulation strategy, which not only narrows spectral bandwidth while red&#8208;shifting emission peak through multiple resonance framework extension, but also energetically and dynamically enhances device longevity via triplet energy reduction. Furthermore, strategic integration of steric hindrance on the emitting backbone suppresses intermolecular interactions and directs reactivity pathways. This emitter concurrently achieves a &#955;max of 456&#160;nm, FWHM of 15&#160;nm and photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield of 98% in dilute toluene. The work highlights linear annulation engineering as a potential approach to resolve the efficiency&#8208;stability&#8208;color purity trilemma in deep&#8208;blue OLEDs.

         <title>Polarization Sensitive Vacuum&#8208;Ultraviolet Photodetectors Based on m&#8208;Plane h&#8208;BN</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The wafer&#8208;scale hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) epitaxial film exhibits pronounced anisotropy in optical absorption and carrier transport stemming from its distinct m&#8208;plane surfaces, greatly favoring its polarized vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) detection. The device demonstrates excellent polarization&#8208;sensitive performance under 188 nm linearly polarized light, along with a remarkable polarization ratio, thus extending the short&#8208;wavelength limit of existing lensless polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetection technologies based on anisotropic semiconductor materials.








Abstract
Vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) detection plays an essential role in space science, radiation monitoring, electronic industry, and fundamental research. Integrating polarization characteristics into VUV detection enriches the comprehension of the target attributes and broadens the signal dimensionality. Polarization detection has been widely developed in visible and infrared regions; however, it is still relatively unexplored in VUV light due to the lack of photoactive materials with low&#8208;symmetry structures, VUV selective response and radiation resistance. Here, the wafer&#8208;scale hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) epitaxial films with the distinct m&#8208;plane surfaces are demonstrated that exhibit significant anisotropy due to space symmetry breaking, instead of the routinely obtained high&#8208;symmetry c&#8208;planes governed by the most thermodynamically stable growth mode. This results in notable anisotropy in light absorption and charge density distributions, yielding a dichroic ratio greater than 10 and a carrier transport efficiency ratio (&#956;&#964;a&#8208;axis/&#956;&#964;c&#8208;axis) of 24. The h&#8208;BN based detector achieves a high polarization ratio of 6.2 for 188 nm VUV polarized light, reaching the short&#8208;wavelength limit of the reported polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors. This work presents an effective strategy for designing polarized VUV photodetector from h&#8208;BN, and paves the road towards the novel integrated optoelectronics, photonics and electronics based on traditional 2D materials.

         <title>Detecting Cr6+ at &#8776;100 pM Concentration with Fluorescence Enhancement Signatures in a Novel Eco&#8208;Fluorophore: Matching WHO's 96 pM Recommended Standard for Drinking Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a dual&#8208;functionalization strategy, carbon quantum dots (CQD) with exceptional fluorescence properties are engineered. These CQD are integrated with graphitic carbon nitride to form a 2D/2D heterostructure via both covalent and non&#8208;covalent modification. This integration enables ultra&#8208;trace Cr&#8310;&#8314; detection with a limit of detection &#8776;70 pM&#8212;surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Cr&#8310;&#8314; sensors.








Abstract
Hexavalent chromium (Cr6+) ions in drinking water pose a significant risk to human health, being a leading cause for neurological disorders, organ damage, and infertility. This study introduces an ultrasensitive method for detecting trace Cr6+ over a wide concentration range (&#8776; 100 pM &#8211; 100&#160;&#181;M) through fluorescence enhancement signatures via integration of both covalent and non&#8208;covalent interaction strategies on carbon quantum dots (CQD). The covalent functionalization is achieved from dual&#8208;functionalized CQD (CQD&#8208;(NH2, COOH)) derived from coffee&#8208;waste. Additionally, the covalent and non&#8208;covalent approach integrates CQD&#8208;(NH2, COOH) with graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) to form a 2D/2D heterostructure. The synergy between CQD&#8208;(NH2, COOH) and g&#8208;C3N4 introduces a mid&#8208;gap band in their band structure, allowing multiple carrier excitation and recombination states, significantly&#160;enhancing the fluorescence quenching signal. This combination allows to achieve Cr6+ detection sensitivity down to &#8776;100 pM concentration&#8212;matching the World Health Organization's 96 pM permissible limit of total Cr in drinking water. Furthermore, a 70 pM detection limit is reported for Cr6+ in a mixture of twelve ions, including cations and anions, surpassing current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art detection limits. These results highlight the potential of dual covalent and non&#8208;covalent modification strategy in nanomaterials to set new standards in ultrasensitive and wide&#8208;range fluorescent sensing applications.

This study introduces an ultrasensitive method for detecting trace Cr&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt; over a wide concentration range (&#8776; 100 pM &#8211; 100&#160;&#181;M) through fluorescence enhancement signatures via integration of both covalent and non-covalent interaction strategies on carbon quantum dots (CQD). The covalent functionalization is achieved from dual-functionalized CQD (CQD-(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, COOH)) derived from coffee-waste. Additionally, the covalent and non-covalent approach integrates CQD-(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, COOH) with graphitic carbon nitride (g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) to form a 2D/2D heterostructure. The synergy between CQD-(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, COOH) and g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; introduces a mid-gap band in their band structure, allowing multiple carrier excitation and recombination states, significantly&#160;enhancing the fluorescence quenching signal. This combination allows to achieve Cr&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt; detection sensitivity down to &#8776;100 pM concentration&#8212;matching the World Health Organization's 96 pM permissible limit of total Cr in drinking water. Furthermore, a 70 pM detection limit is reported for Cr&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt; in a mixture of twelve ions, including cations and anions, surpassing current state-of-the-art detection limits. These results highlight the potential of dual covalent and non-covalent modification strategy in nanomaterials to set new standards in ultrasensitive and wide-range fluorescent sensing applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Decoupling Interlayer Interactions Boosts Charge Separation in Covalent Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Efficiency Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The weak interlayer coupling suppresses the recombination of photogenerated electron and hole, facilitating charge separation. The optimized PY&#8208;CN&#8208;BIP&#8208;Ni achieves 553.3&#160;&#181;mol g&#8315;&#185; h&#8315;&#185; CO production (94% selectivity), eightfold faster than its isomer with strong interlayer interactions under visible light.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising photocatalysts owing to their structural diversity, tunable bandgaps, and exceptional light&#8208;harvesting capabilities. While previous studies primarily focus on developing narrow&#8208;bandgap COFs for broad&#8208;spectrum solar energy utilization, the critical role of interlayer coupling in regulating charge transfer dynamics remains unclear. Conventional monolayer&#8208;based theoretical models inadequately address interlayer effects that potentially hindering intralayer electron transport to catalytic active sites. This work employs density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the influence of interlayer interactions on intralayer charge transfer in imine&#8208;based COFs. Theoretical analyses reveal that bilayer architectures exhibit pronounced interlayer interference in intramolecular charge transfer processes which has not been observed in monolayer models. Based on these mechanistic insights, this work designs two isomeric pyrene&#8208;based COFs incorporating identical electron donor (pyrene) and acceptor (nickel bipyridine) units but with distinct interlayer coupling strengths. Strikingly, the optimized COF with weakened interlayer interactions demonstrates exceptional photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance, achieving a CO evolution rate of 553.3&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 with 94% selectivity under visible light irradiation without additional photosensitizers or co&#8208;catalysts. These findings establish interlayer engineering as a crucial design principle for developing high&#8208;performance COF&#8208;based photocatalysts for solar energy conversion applications.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Triggered Nanoparticles Induce Cuproptosis for Enhancing Immunogenic Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphiphilic polymers Poly RA and Poly MPN are self&#8208;assembled into biodegradable nanocarriers (RC NPs), which are evaluated for their antitumor performance in pancreatic cancer models. Upon accumulation at the tumor site, the RC NPs can be activated by ultrasound for SDT, generating ROS capable of killing cancer cells and promoting the release of Cu2+, which in turn induces cuproptosis and suppresses tumor progression. Notably, both processes are capable of inducing ICD and enhancing antitumor immune responses.








Abstract
Cuproptosis, as a novel mechanism of cell death, holds significant promise for tumor therapy. However, existing studies typically employ methods to induce cuproptosis through endogenous or exogenous pathways, which often fail to achieve precise control in both space and time. Herein, polymeric nanoparticles (RC NPs) are developed that enable precise activation of cuproptosis through acoustic control for tumor&#8208;specific treatment. The nanoparticles are fabricated via self&#8208;assembly of a degradable, acoustic&#8208;sensitive polymer (Poly RA) and a metal&#8208;ion&#8208;loadable polyphenol&#8208;structured polymer (Poly MPN). Ultrasound stimulation cleaved the RC NPs, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and promoting the release of copper ions from Poly MPN, leading to the aggregation of lipoylated proteins and depletion of iron&#8208;sulfur cluster proteins to introduce cuproptosis. Subsequently, the RC NPs successfully activated the immune system of mice, promoting the maturation of antigen&#8208;presenting cells and the activation of T lymphocytes. The nanoparticles exhibited good biosafety and significant tumor inhibition in both orthotopic and patient&#8208;derived xenograft (PDX) models. These novel nanoparticles provide a promising modality for the treatment of highly aggressive cancers and a valuable avenue for future clinical applications.

         <title>Fast&#8208;Charging Phosphorus Anodes Enabled by Fluorinated Weakly Solvated Electrolytes for Stable and High&#8208;Rate Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal weakly&#8208;solvated electrolyte design principle is established for phosphorus&#8208;based anodes through systematic evaluation. Based on this criterion, the fluorinated solvent of FEC emerges as the optimal co&#8208;solvent, effectively suppressing the dissolution of lithium polyphosphides while enhancing desolvation/charge&#8208;transfer kinetics and simultaneously fostering a stable inorganic&#8208;rich SEI layer. This rational strategy addresses critical interfacial challenges in high&#8208;performance phosphorus&#8208;based battery systems.








Abstract
Phosphorus&#8208;based anodes hold promise for energy storage due to their high theoretical capacity and favorable lithiation potential. However, their practical application is hindered by sluggish reaction kinetics and irreversible capacity loss, primarily attributed to multiphase lithiation/delithiation reactions and the dissolution of lithium polyphosphide intermediates. Herein, a universal design principle of weakly solvated electrolytes (WSEs) tailored for phosphorus&#8208;based anodes is proposed. Combined with a high dielectric constant, and significant dipole moment, a fluorinated cosolvent is incorporated into a WSE to effectively suppress the dissolutions of lithium polyphosphides, enhance interfacial stability, and accelerate reaction kinetics. With this electrolyte, a phosphorus&#8208;based anode achieves a remarkable capacity of 2615.2 mAh g&#8315;&#185; at 1C, maintaining 91.7% capacity retention over 1000 cycles. Even at a high rate of 4 C, it delivers 2210.7 mAh g&#8315;&#185; with an exceptional retention of 96.7% after 1500 cycles. Furthermore, at 0 &#176;C, the anode sustains a capacity of 2016.7 mAh g&#8315;&#185;, with 97% retention after 300 cycles at 1C. This study provides a novel electrolyte design strategy to regulate the solvation sheath, paving the way for high&#8208;rate, long&#8208;cycle phosphorus&#8208;based anodes suitable for fast&#8208;charging applications.

         <title>Biomimetic Hybrid PROTAC Nanovesicles Block Multiple DNA Repair Pathways to Overcome Temozolomide Resistance Against Orthotopic Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic nanotechnology, drug delivery, glioblastoma, PROTAC, temozolomide resistance. A biomimetic PROTAC nanovesicle (M@TP) combining temozolomide (TMZ) with GSH&#8208;activatable prodrug (PC&#8208;ss&#8208;Pro) has been developed, which can penetrate the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) and target glioblastoma (GBM) through homotypic recognition, and restore sensitivity to TMZ by inducing BRD4 degradation. M@TP effectively inhibits the growth of TMZ&#8208;resistant GBM and postoperative GBM, offering a feasible strategy to overcome TMZ resistance and improve the prognosis of GBM.








Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) remains one of the deadliest forms of cancer due to its high rates of postoperative recurrence and resistance to treatment. Temozolomide (TMZ) is the standard chemotherapy for GBM. However, the therapeutic efficacy of TMZ is significantly compromised by the activation of various intracellular DNA repair mechanisms that facilitate TMZ resistance. Herein, the upregulation of bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4 (BRD4) expression is demonstrated to be a key contributor to TMZ resistance in GBM. To address this challenge, a biomimetic hybrid PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTAC) liposome delivery system (M@TP) is developed. This system efficiently penetrates the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) and specifically targets GBM cells through homotypic recognition. Once within TMZ&#8208;resistant GBM cells, the released PROTAC from M@TP can specifically degrade BRD4, effectively inhibiting multiple DNA repair pathways and restoring sensitivity to TMZ treatment. In vivo, studies showed that M@TP demonstrated significant efficacy in suppressing tumor growth in both TMZ&#8208;resistant and postoperative GBM, with prolonged mouse survival times. These findings highlight the potential of M@TP as a promising strategy to overcome TMZ resistance and improve therapeutic outcomes in GBM.

         <title>Luminescent Liquid Crystalline Elastomer Promoted Self&#8208;Adaptive Smart Active Optical Waveguide with Ultra&#8208;Low Optical Loss</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart optical waveguides with ultra&#8208;low optical loss have been fabricated using luminescent liquid crystalline elastomers. These waveguides exhibit excellent self&#8208;adaptive properties, making them promising for integrated photonic systems enabling low&#8208;loss, high&#8208;speed data transmission.








Abstract
Currently, optical waveguides show extensive application in photonics and optoelectronic devices due to their high information capacity and transmission capabilities. However, developing self&#8208;adaptive, smart optical waveguide materials with ultra&#8208;low optical loss remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, luminescent liquid crystalline elastomers (LLCEs) with remarkable flexibility and minimal optical loss through one&#8208;pot synthetic method is synthesized, marking the first example of such an approach. The resultant organic optical waveguide materials (OOWMs) demonstrate exceptional mechanical performance and low optical loss, even under significant deformation. An optical loss coefficient of 0.0375&#160;dB&#160;mm&#8722;1 has been achieved in LLCE&#8208;based OOWMs through synergistic F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer. Additionally, these flexible OOWMs can endure large deformations and be shaped into arbitrary forms within macro&#8208;scale dimensions. Notably, LLCE&#8208;based OOWMs demonstrate smart, self&#8208;adaptive behavior with ultra&#8208;low optical loss when exposed to heat or light. Consequently, these OOWMs can be used to fabricate photo switches of various shapes. This work provides a feasible approach to achieving integrated photonic systems with low optical loss for intelligent high&#8208;speed data transmission.

         <title>Improving the Dynamic Stability of High&#8208;Efficiency Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes by Core&#8211;shell Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism behind the poor dynamic stability of quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes is revealed, and their dynamic stability is significantly improved through core&#8211;shell engineering of quantum dots. With over 10 000 voltage scanning cycles in the range of 0&#8211;2.6&#160;V, this advancement brings quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes closer to commercialization.








Abstract
Quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QD&#8208;LEDs) hold great potential for enabling ultra&#8208;clear and ultra&#8208;bright display technologies. Although the operational life of QD&#8208;LEDs under static conditions has reached commercial standards, their dynamic stability, i.e., performance consistency while being switched on and off, remains largely behind that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art III&#8208;V inorganic LEDs. In this work, the degradation mechanism of red&#8208;emitting CdZnSe/ZnSe QD&#8208;LEDs with high external quantum efficiency (EQE) and long static operating lifetime is studied. Surprisingly, it is found that the accelerated EQE decline is mainly due to the fast&#8208;increasing electron leakage into the organic hole transport layer (HTL) under continuous voltage scans. To improve the dynamic stability of QD&#8208;LEDs, these findings inspired us to refine the size and architecture of CdZnSe/ZnSe QDs by introducing a ZnSeS/ZnS outer shell, where the ZnS shell improves the electron confinement and the ZnSeS mitigates the lattice mismatch between ZnSe and ZnS. Consequently, the electron leakage into the HTL is significantly inhibited, leading to QD&#8208;LEDs with minimal EQE drop of &lt;4% after &gt;5000 voltage cycles within a 0&#160;&#8722;&#160;4.5&#160;V voltage range, while the devices still possessed excellent static stability, as their T95 at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 for over 61 000&#160;h.

         <title>Topology&#8208;Sensitive Spin&#8208;Selecting Super&#8208;Exchange Interactions at Half&#8208;Antiperovskites with Orderly&#8208;Oxidized Semimetals for Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intriguing orderly&#8208;oxidization strategy is proposed to construct semi&#8208;metallic catalytic units in the topology&#8208;sensitive half&#8208;antiperovskites, in which the spin renormalization from low&#8208;spin state to high&#8208;spin state of active sites can simultaneously improve spin&#8208;dependent acidic OER reactivity and stability. These findings provide new inspirations for steering the spin&#8208;related acidic OER pathway and further promoting the application of topological materials in energy/environmental science.








Abstract
Developing inexpensive catalysts for acidic water oxidation plays a critical role in energy conversions and storages, but which have to trade off their catalytic activity and electrochemical stability. Different from traditional nano&#8208;engineering, herein we focus onto manipulating the spin&#8208;dependent topological quantum interactions to facilitate acidic water splitting at half&#8208;antiperovskite (Ni2Co1In2S2) with orderly&#8208;oxidized Kagome lattices, in which spatial wave functions of the triangular metal units (M3) are spontaneously converted to the anti&#8208;symmetry feature due to the symmetry breaking from controllable bridged&#8208;oxygen decorations (M3O), leading to a spin&#8208;selecting&#8208;dependent electronic reconfiguration. This topology&#8208;sensitive symmetry breaking makes the super&#8208;exchange interactions among neighboring metal sites switch to the indirect out&#8208;plane configuration (M&#9472;O&#9472;M) from the direct in&#8208;plane form (M&#9472;M), meanwhile the spin&#8208;dependent transformation from antiferromagnetic states to ferromagnetic states causes these metal sites to demonstrate a semi&#8208;metallic property for optimizing their bonding interactions with reactants. As a result, the capacity of carrier migration and intermediate diffusion in the inner Helmholtz region is significantly improved, which makes mass activity increase to 20.5 A g&#8722;1 at an overpotential of &#8776;356&#160;mV, demonstrating an obvious superiority over the other state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts without noble metals. This work provides a new insight for designing topology&#8208;dependent catalysts to better understand spin&#8208;related reaction kinetics.

         <dc:description>
In situ polymerized polyfluorinated crosslinked polyether electrolytes are engineered for high&#8208;voltage Li metal batteries. Electron&#8208;withdrawing fluorinated groups enhance oxidative stability, improve interfacial compatibility, and promote inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase formation for uniform Li deposition. Ah&#8208;level Li||NCM811 pouch cells achieve&#160;401.8&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 specific energy, showcasing promise for practical high&#8208;energy&#8208;density solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries.








Abstract
In situ polymerized polyether electrolytes are promising for solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries due to their high ionic conductivity and excellent interfacial contact. However, their practical application is hindered by Li dendrite formation, interfacial degradation, and limited oxidative stability. Herein, we propose an in situ polymerized polyfluorinated crosslinked polyether electrolyte (PDOL&#8208;OFHDBO), synthesized by copolymerizing 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (DOL) with 2,2&#8242;&#8208;(2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5&#8208;octafluorohexane&#8208;1,6&#8208;diyl)bis(oxirane) (OFHDBO) as a polyfluorinated crosslinker. The electron&#8208;withdrawing polyfluorinated groups endow PDOL&#8208;OFHDBO with enhanced oxidative stability and interfacial compatibility, while reducing the solvation power of the polymer matrix to promote an anion&#8208;derived inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase for uniform Li deposition. Consequently, PDOL&#8208;OFHDBO exhibits a wide electrochemical stability window (&gt;5.6&#160;V) and enables long&#8208;term stable Li plating/stripping for over 1100&#160;h. Furthermore, Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) full cells utilizing PDOL&#8208;OFHDBO demonstrate outstanding cycling stability with high&#8208;loading cathodes (&#8776;3.8 mAh cm&#8722;2) and thin Li anodes (50&#160;&#181;m), achieving capacity retention of 95.5% and 89.1% over 100 cycles at cut&#8208;off voltages of 4.3 and 4.5&#160;V, respectively. Remarkably, Ah&#8208;level Li||NCM811 pouch cells deliver an impressive specific energy of 401.8&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, highlighting their potential for practical solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries.

Furthermore, Li||LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NCM811) full cells utilizing PDOL-OFHDBO demonstrate outstanding cycling stability with high-loading cathodes (&#8776;3.8 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and thin Li anodes (50&#160;&#181;m), achieving capacity retention of 95.5% and 89.1% over 100 cycles at cut-off voltages of 4.3 and 4.5&#160;V, respectively. Remarkably, Ah-level Li||NCM811 pouch cells deliver an impressive specific energy of 401.8&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, highlighting their potential for practical solid-state Li metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanical Homogenization Promoting Dual&#8208;Directional Upcycling of Layered Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces an efficient dual&#8208;directional upcycling scheme enabled through a mechanical homogenization pretreatment. It enables various layered oxide cathodes to be reprocessed into fresh NCM cathodes with tailored Ni contents through boosted atomic diffusion in just 4&#160;h of solid&#8208;state sintering. Delivering upcycled cathodes with comparable electrochemical performances to their commercial counterparts, this approach excels itself from the cost&#8208;effectiveness over conventional acid&#8208;leaching resynthesis approaches.








Abstract
Upcycling is regarded as a sustainable and promising recycling solution for spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, current upcycling strategies such as converting Ni&#8208;lean to Ni&#8208;rich cathodes struggle to change the composition of the spent cathodes to meet the diverse market demands. In addition, the commonly employed molten&#8208;salts method requires tens of&#160;hours of high&#8208;temperature treatment, restricting its sustainability. Herein, this study reports an efficient, flexible dual&#8208;directional upcycling strategy to upcycle a broad family of layered oxide cathodes into fresh LiNixCoyMnzO2 (NCM) cathodes with tailored Ni&#8208;contents&#8212;either increased or decreased&#8212;in just 4&#160;h via mechanical homogenization pretreatment. This study confirms that the bulk diffusion of transition metals (TMs) is the rate&#8208;determining step in the resynthesis process, and the mechanical homogenization can shorten the diffusion pathway of TMs, thus reducing the sintering duration effectively. The as&#8208;upcycled NCM cathodes can deliver electrochemical performance on par with commercial counterparts. Notably, a systematic technoeconomic analysis shows that upcycling spent LiCoO2 into NCM622 can yield a profit up to 35 US$/kg, 30% higher than the conventional acid&#8208;leaching resynthesis approach. This work provides an energy&#8208;saving, widely adaptable, flexible, and cost&#8208;efficient method for regenerating spent cathode materials, paving the way for the sustainable recycling of LIBs.

         <title>Monitoring &#945;/&#946; Particles Using a Copper Cluster Scintillator Detector</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper cluster scintillator with excellent stability and scintillation performance, which shows high sensitivity response to &#945;/&#946; particles, is constructed. By coupling it with PMT and nuclear electronics system, a surface contamination monitor for precise detection of &#945;/&#946; particles is successfully fabricated.








Abstract
High&#8208;energy radiation is widely used in medicine, industry, and scientific research. Meanwhile, the detection of environmental ionizing radiation is essential to ensure the safe use of high&#8208;energy radiation. Among radiation detectors, scintillator detectors offer multiple advantages, including simple structure, high sensitivity, excellent environmental adaptability, and a favorable performance&#8208;to&#8208;price ratio. However, the development of high&#8208;performance scintillators that can provide highly sensitive responses to environmental radiation, especially &#945;/&#946; particles, remains a challenge. In this work, a copper cluster (Cu4I4(DPPPy)2) with excellent water&#8208;oxygen stability is prepared using a simple one&#8208;pot method at room temperature. Cu4I4(DPPPy)2 not only exhibits excellent X&#8208;ray excited luminescence (XEL) under X&#8208;ray irradiation but also demonstrates a highly sensitive scintillation response to &#945;/&#946; particles. By integrating Cu4I4(DPPPy)2 with a photomultiplier tube (PMT) and nuclear electronics, an &#945;/&#946; surface contamination monitor is successfully developed. This monitor enables the sensitive detection of excessive &#945;/&#946; particles in real&#8208;world environments. The detection frequency and signal intensity of Cu4I4(DPPPy)2 significantly surpass those of commercial scintillator of YAP:Ce, BGO, PbWO4, and anthracene under identical conditions, highlighting the promising application of metal clusters in low&#8208;dose environmental radiation detection.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Sintering Ni&#8208;W Catalytic Layer on Reductive Tungsten Carbides for Superior High&#8208;Temperature CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance anti&#8208;sintering catalyst with efficient and ultra&#8208;stable Ni&#8208;W catalytic layer on reductive WC (NiAWC) with stabilized Ni&#948;+ sites for superior high&#8208;temperature RWGS reaction. Here the concept of design of high&#8208;performance catalysts through metal&#8208;substrate synergistic effects offers a promising path to engineering superior high&#8208;temperature thermal catalysis.








Abstract
The reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction stands out as a promising approach for selectively converting CO2 into CO, which can then be upgraded into high&#8208;value&#8208;added products. While designing high selectivity and stability catalysts for RWGS reaction remains a significant challenge. In this study, an efficient and ultra&#8208;stable Ni&#8208;W catalytic layer on reductive WC (NiAWC) is designed as an anti&#8208;sintering catalyst for superior high&#8208;temperature RWGS reaction. Benefiting from the unique structures, the NiAWC catalyst exhibits exceptionally high performances with a CO production rate of 1.84 molCO&#160;gNi&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and over 95% CO selectivity, maintaining stability for 120 h at 500&#160;&#176;C. Even after 300 h of continuous testing at 600&#160;&#176;C and five aging cycles at 800&#160;&#176;C, the activity loss is only 0.34% and 0.83%, respectively. Unlike the conventional mechanism in RWGS reaction, it is demonstrated that the Ni&#8208;W limited coordination can stabilize the Ni sites and allow a pre&#8208;oxidation of Ni&#948;+ by CO, which produces an O* electronic reservoir and hinders the charge transfer from Ni to W&#8208;O, thereby avoiding the dissolution of Ni atoms. The design of new, efficient, and selective catalysts through metal&#8208;substrate synergistic effects is suggested to offer a promising path to engineering superior thermal catalysts.

         <title>Chiral Aluminum Oxyhydroxide Supraparticles as Adjuvants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral flower&#8208;like aluminum oxyhydroxide (AlOOH) supraparticles (SPs) are fabricated as an adjuvant, indicating that that L&#8208;SPs enters dendritic cells (DCs) via Toll&#8208;like receptor 2 (TLR2) to enhance NOD&#8208;like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation.








Abstract
Aluminum&#8208;based adjuvants dominate global vaccine formulations owing to their proven efficacy in humoral immunity induction. However, their inherent limitations in activating cellular immunity pose critical challenges for vaccine development. In this study, chiral flower&#8208;like aluminum oxyhydroxide (AlOOH) supraparticles (SPs) are synthesized via a one&#8208;pot hydrothermal method using cysteine (Cys) enantiomers as chiral ligands, achieving a g&#8208;factor of 0.004. L&#8208;AlOOH SPs (L&#8208;SPs) demonstrate significantly greater enhancement in dendritic cell (DC) maturation and antigen cross&#8208;presentation efficiency compared to D&#8208;AlOOH SPs (D&#8208;SPs), indicating its potential as an adjuvant. Mechanistic studies reveal that L&#8208;SPs enter DCs via Toll&#8208;like receptor 2 (TLR2), thereby enhancing NOD&#8208;like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation. In vivo experiments show that L&#8208;SPs generate 21.59&#8208;fold higher OVA&#8208;specific antibody titers than commercial aluminum adjuvants. Further studies show that L&#8208;SPs, after mixed with H9N2 virus proteins, enhance influenza virus antibody titers by 15.28&#8208;fold, with sustained protection, confirming its translational potential. This study demonstrates the performance of chiral AlOOH SPs to simultaneously amplify humoral and cellular immunological responses, entering it as a promising next&#8208;generation adjuvant for cancer immunotherapy and pandemic preparedness.

&lt;p&gt;Chiral flower-like aluminum oxyhydroxide (AlOOH) supraparticles (SPs) are fabricated as an adjuvant, indicating that that L-SPs enters dendritic cells (DCs) via Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) to enhance NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aluminum-based adjuvants dominate global vaccine formulations owing to their proven efficacy in humoral immunity induction. However, their inherent limitations in activating cellular immunity pose critical challenges for vaccine development. In this study, chiral flower-like aluminum oxyhydroxide (AlOOH) supraparticles (SPs) are synthesized via a one-pot hydrothermal method using cysteine (Cys) enantiomers as chiral ligands, achieving a g-factor of 0.004. L-AlOOH SPs (L-SPs) demonstrate significantly greater enhancement in dendritic cell (DC) maturation and antigen cross-presentation efficiency compared to D-AlOOH SPs (D-SPs), indicating its potential as an adjuvant. Mechanistic studies reveal that L-SPs enter DCs via Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), thereby enhancing NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation. In vivo experiments show that L-SPs generate 21.59-fold higher OVA-specific antibody titers than commercial aluminum adjuvants. Further studies show that L-SPs, after mixed with H9N2 virus proteins, enhance influenza virus antibody titers by 15.28-fold, with sustained protection, confirming its translational potential. This study demonstrates the performance of chiral AlOOH SPs to simultaneously amplify humoral and cellular immunological responses, entering it as a promising next-generation adjuvant for cancer immunotherapy and pandemic preparedness.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioactive Glass Microscaffolds Fabricated by Two&#8208;Photon Lithography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microstructuring of bioactive glasses offers great potential to influence cell behavior for bone tissue engineering. By utilizing two&#8208;photon lithography of a nanocomposite and thermal post&#8208;processing, single&#8208;micron features and complex structures are achieved. The processed glass showed in vitro bioactivity and cytocompatibility toward human mesenchymal stem cells, making it suitable for culturing such cell types.








Abstract
Porous scaffolds made of bioactive glass (BG) are of great interest for tissue engineering as they can bond to bone rapidly and promote new bone formation. Pores and channels between 100 and 500&#160;&#181;m provide space for cell intrusion and nutrient supply, facilitating bone ingrowth and vascularization. Furthermore, smaller pores and structural features of a few microns in size influence cell behavior, such as adhesion and osteogenic differentiation. Additive manufacturing (AM) is well suited to fabricate such geometries. However, microstructuring BG is demanding and common AM techniques are unable to achieve features below 100&#160;&#181;m. In this work, two&#8208;photon lithography (TPL) is used for the first time to structure BG with single&#8208;micron features. A composite containing BG nanoparticles is structured using TPL and thermally processed to receive glass scaffolds. The glass used in this study demonstrates in vitro bioactivity in simulated body fluid (SBF) and cytocompatibility toward human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), making it a suitable material for tissue engineering. This process will open a toolbox for a variety of existing BG particles to be shaped with features as small as 6&#160;&#181;m and will broaden the understanding of the influence of scaffold design on cell behavior.

         <title>Harnessing Spin&#8208;Lattice Interplay in Metal Nitrides for Efficient Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>

The incorporation of Mo triggers a high&#8208;spin to low&#8208;spin transition in Co centers, achieving efficient nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion. This spin&#8208;engineered catalytic system establishes a transformative platform for sustainable energy technologies, advancing frontier applications in electrocatalysis.








Abstract
Metal nitrides, renowned for their spin&#8208;lattice&#8208;charge interplay, offer vast potential in catalysis, electronics, and energy conversion. However, spin polarization manipulation in these nitrides remains a challenge for multi&#8208;electron electrocatalytic processes. This study introduces Co3Mo3N with a low&#8208;spin polarization configuration, achieved by incorporating spin&#8208;free lattice Mo with 4d orbitals into high&#8208;spin polarization Co4N. This innovation delivers outstanding nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia electrosynthesis, ranking among the best to date. Mo inclusion induces competing magnetic exchange interactions, reducing the spin polarization degree and enabling rate&#8208;determining step of NO2* to NO&#8208;OH* conversion via vertex&#8208;sharing NMo6 octahedra. A paired electro&#8208;refinery with a Co3Mo3N cathode achieves 2&#8201;000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 2.28&#160;V and sustains an industrial&#8208;scale current of 1&#8201;000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for 2,100&#160;h, with an NH3 production rate of &#8776;70&#160;mg NH3&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2. This work establishes a transformative platform for spin polarization degree&#8208;engineered electrocatalysts, driving breakthroughs in energy conversion technologies.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer Interface with Reconstructed Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Network for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) with reconstructed hydrogen&#8208;bond network to form an efficient three&#8208;phase interface that facilitates CO2 mass transport and maintained an ideal H+/e&#8722; transfer pathway. The optimized catalyst maintains a high current density of 502.5 mA cm&#8722;2 with over 85% C2+ Faradaic efficiency and operated very stably.








Abstract
CO2 electrolysis is a promising approach to reduce CO2 emissions while achieving high&#8208;value multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products. Except for the key role of electrocatalyst for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), Reaction microenvironment is another critical factor influencing catalytic performance for these catalysts. Herein, a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) is proposed with reconstructed hydrogen&#8208;bond network to form an efficient three&#8208;phase interface that admins mass transport and ion&#8208;electron transfer. This approach is realized by co&#8208;assembly of the fluorinated SAM (F&#8208;SAM) and siloxane on commercial Cu catalyst (Cu@F&#8208;Si composite catalyst). Molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) and interfacial species analysis show that the F&#8208;SAM effectively facilitates CO2 mass transport,&#160;while the siloxane hydrogen bond network maintains an ideal H+/e&#8722; transfer pathway. Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, this strategy reveals the mechanism by which optimizing *H/*CO coverage enhances C2+ product selectivity. Ultimately, the Cu@F&#8208;Si catalyst maintains a high current density of 502.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with over 85% C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FE) and operates stably for more than 100&#160;h at &#8776;300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This interface engineering strategy offers a promising solution for improving the efficiency of CO2RR, with broader applications in multiphase catalytic systems.

         <title>Bifacially Reinforced Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer Interfaces for Minimized Recombination Loss and Enhanced Stability in Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric &#960;&#8208;extended self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM), 4&#8208;PhCz, is designed to bifacially reinforce transparent conductive electrode/SAM and SAM/perovskite interfaces. It exhibits enhanced surface coverage on indium tin oxide (ITO) and excellent energy&#8208;level alignment with 1.67&#160;eV perovskite, ultimately achieving a 31.26% power conversion efficiency in perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells, retaining 92% of its initial efficiency after 1000 h of maximum power point tracking (MPPT).








Abstract
Perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells have shown higher power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) than single&#8208;junction cells. However, their record PCE still falls short of the theoretical maximum, and their stability is significantly lower than that of crystalline silicon solar cells. These challenges stem from the substantial losses in open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) and the instability of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite devices, which are mainly caused by nonradiative recombination and degradation at the heterojunction interfaces, respectively. Specifically, the weak adhesion between indium tin oxide (ITO) and self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs), along with inadequate interactions between the SAMs and the perovskite, contributes to this instability. Herein, a novel SAM material, 4&#8208;(11H&#8208;benzo[a]carbazol&#8208;11&#8208;yl)butyl (4&#8208;PhCz), has been developed to bifacially reinforce interfaces by enhancing SAM coverage on ITO and strengthening the interactions between SAM and perovskites. The resulting 1.67&#160;eV perovskite solar cell (PSCs) achieves a VOC of 1.273&#160;V with a low voltage loss of 0.397&#160;V relative to the bandgap and a PCE of 22.53%. The 4&#8208;PhCz&#8208;based perovskite/silicon tandem cell achieves a VOC of 1.96&#160;V and a PCE of 31.26%, retaining 92% of its initial efficiency after 1000 h of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under 1&#8208;sun illumination in a nitrogen atmosphere at 25 &#176;C.

&lt;p&gt;An asymmetric &#960;-extended self-assembled monolayer (SAM), 4-PhCz, is designed to bifacially reinforce transparent conductive electrode/SAM and SAM/perovskite interfaces. It exhibits enhanced surface coverage on indium tin oxide (ITO) and excellent energy-level alignment with 1.67&#160;eV perovskite, ultimately achieving a 31.26% power conversion efficiency in perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells, retaining 92% of its initial efficiency after 1000 h of maximum power point tracking (MPPT).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells have shown higher power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) than single-junction cells. However, their record PCE still falls short of the theoretical maximum, and their stability is significantly lower than that of crystalline silicon solar cells. These challenges stem from the substantial losses in open-circuit voltage (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;) and the instability of wide-bandgap perovskite devices, which are mainly caused by nonradiative recombination and degradation at the heterojunction interfaces, respectively. Specifically, the weak adhesion between indium tin oxide (ITO) and self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), along with inadequate interactions between the SAMs and the perovskite, contributes to this instability. Herein, a novel SAM material, 4-(11H-benzo[a]carbazol-11-yl)butyl (4-PhCz), has been developed to bifacially reinforce interfaces by enhancing SAM coverage on ITO and strengthening the interactions between SAM and perovskites. The resulting 1.67&#160;eV perovskite solar cell (PSCs) achieves a &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; of 1.273&#160;V with a low voltage loss of 0.397&#160;V relative to the bandgap and a PCE of 22.53%. The 4-PhCz-based perovskite/silicon tandem cell achieves a &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; of 1.96&#160;V and a PCE of 31.26%, retaining 92% of its initial efficiency after 1000 h of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under 1-sun illumination in a nitrogen atmosphere at 25 &#176;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ionic Liquid MPII3 Elevates Electrochromic Battery Capacity to Practical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionic liquid 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;propylimidazolium triiodide (MPII3) based electrochromic battery is developed, achieving a high areal capacity of 56&#160;396&#160;mAh&#160;m&#8722;2, which is substantially higher than those of previously reported electrochromic batteries.








Abstract
Electrochromic batteries are multifunctional devices that integrate optical modulation with energy storage capabilities through electrochemical reactions. Traditional electrochromic batteries rely on solid&#8208;state thin films, but their limited material loading constrains capacity to &#8776;100&#8211;300&#160;mAh&#160;m&#8722;2, failing to meet practical demands. Herein, an electrochromic battery based on ionic liquid 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;propylimidazolium triiodide (MPII3) is proposed, where the color&#8208;changing mechanism is based on the reversible redox reaction of I&#8722;/I3&#8722; in solution, with 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;propylimidazolium cation (MPI+) forming a complex with I3&#8722; to suppress its shuttle effect. More importantly, the resulting ionic liquid MPII3 demonstrates exceptional reaction kinetics, enabling rapid and extensive charge transfer, thereby significantly enhancing the energy storage potential of electrochromic batteries. The fabricated devices achieve a high capacity of 56396&#160;mAh&#160;m&#8722;2 at a current density of 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Additionally, these MPII3 electrochromic batteries exhibit an optical modulation as high as 68.1% and excellent cycling stability, with 92.3% capacity retention after 20&#160;000 cycles. These findings represent a significant advancement and are expected to promote the practical application of electrochromic batteries in smart windows, energy&#8208;efficient buildings, and other fields.

         <title>A High&#8208;Throughput Approach to Identifying Environment&#8208;Friendly Artificial Antisolvents for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;throughput approach is used to screen 40 perovskite antisolvents and pinpoint specific regions favorable for the formation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films based on Hansen solubility parameters (HSPs). The low&#8208;toxicity candidates are obtained by adjusting the HSPs and validated for different perovskite compositions.








Abstract
Rapid crystallization facilitated by antisolvents is widely employed for producing high&#8208;quality perovskite films, but constrained by the limited variety and high toxicity of conventional solvents, underscoring the need for sustainable and low&#8208;toxicity solvent systems for large&#8208;scale production. In this study, a systematic screening of over 40 antisolvents is conducted using a high&#8208;throughput platform, uncovering a significant correlation between the antisolvent properties within Hansen solubility space and the structural and optoelectronic characteristics of the resultant perovskite films. A Hansen solubility sphere is subsequently constructed, pinpointing a specific region within this space that is most conducive to the formation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films. The underlying mechanism is further elucidated: antisolvents situated outside this optimal region either induce a rapid extraction of N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF), thereby limiting grain growth due to insufficient crystallization time or fail to adequately extract DMF. Since no ideal low&#8208;toxicity single antisolvent is found, a general concept based on solvent combinations with ultra&#8208;low&#8208;toxicity is introduced to solve the issues. The design rule for environment&#8208;friendly &#8220;artificial&#8221; solvents, which is validated for different perovskite compositions, paves the way for sustainable development and production of perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic technologies.

         <title>An Atomically Dispersed Pd Sub&#8208;Metallene: Intermediate State of Single Atoms and Metal Bonds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work fabricates abundant vacancy defects on the MXene surface for anchoring neighboring metal single atoms, to construct atomically dispersed sub&#8208;metallene (Pd ADSM) on the nanoscale. Pd ADSM combines the advantages of 2D structures, single atoms, and metal bonds, which makes it excellent and active in alkaline hydrogen evolution reactions and room&#8208;temperature hydrogen sensing.









Abstract
Despite the metal coordination and single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) have been extensively investigated in surface science over the past decade, their overall activity in involving multi&#8208;step reactions remains unsatisfactory owing to the metal bond and single atom being irreconcilable. Here, a stable atomically dispersed Pd sub&#8208;metallene (Pd ADSM) layer supported on the 2D MXene (Mo2TiC2) is reported, which combines the advantages of 2D structures, single atoms, and metal bonds. Pd ADSM shows covalent structures along the z&#8208;coordination and highly coordinated metal bonds in the 2D direction. During the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), Pd ADSM shows 7&#8208; and 112&#8208;times higher mass activity than the SAC (Pd SAC) and commercial Pt/C at the overpotential of &#8722;108 mV, respectively. Operando characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the Pd&#9472;Pd interface not only makes the adsorbed water form a flexible hydrogen&#8208;bonded skeleton closer to the catalytic center but also reduces the energy barrier for the HER rate&#8208;determining step. Moreover, the moderate adsorption energy of Pd&#9472;Pd bonds in ADSM can rapidly activate, dissociate, and desorb hydrogen molecules at room temperature, resulting in record&#8208;high hydrogen sensing performances (Response time, Recovery time, and Sensitivity for 100 ppm H2 are 4.8, 1.6 s, and 43.5%, respectively).

         <title>Toward the Ideal Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalyst: a Noble Metal&#8208;Free Antiperovskite Optimized with A&#8208;Site Tuning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free antiperovskite CdNNi3 is for the first time reported to fulfill the essential criteria for an ideal alkaline HER electrocatalyst with excellent performance, benefiting from the inherent metallic characteristics and unique multifunction&#8208;site synergy whereby Ni sites facilitate the H2O dissociation/OH&#8722; desorption and Cd&#8211;Ni bridge sites are active for the optimal H* adsorption and H2 evolution.








Abstract
To achieve the ideal non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal HER electrocatalyst in alkaline media, developing conductive systems with multiple active sites targeting every elementary step in the alkaline HER, is highly desirable but remains a great challenge. Herein, a conductive noble metal&#8208;free antiperovskite CdNNi3 is reported with intrinsic metallic characteristics as a highly efficient alkaline HER electrocatalyst, which is designed by the facile A&#8208;site tuning strategy with the modulation the electronic structures and interfacial water configurations of antiperovskites. Impressively, the HER performance of CdNNi3 antiperovskite is superior to various state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art non&#8208;noble metal catalysts ever reported, and also outperforms the commercial Raney Ni catalyst when assemble as the cathode in the practical anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) device. With insights from comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations, the CdNNi3 can create synergistic dual active sites for catalyzing different elementary steps of the alkaline HER; namely, the Ni site can effectively facilitate the H2O dissociation and OH&#8722; desorption, while the unusual Cd&#8211;Ni bridge site is active for the optimal H* adsorption and H2 evolution. Such multifunction&#8208;site synergy, together with inherent high electrical conductivity, enables the CdNNi3 antiperovskite to fulfill the essential criteria for an ideal non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal alkaline HER electrocatalyst with excellent performance.

&lt;p&gt;A noble-metal-free antiperovskite CdNNi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is for the first time reported to fulfill the essential criteria for an ideal alkaline HER electrocatalyst with excellent performance, benefiting from the inherent metallic characteristics and unique multifunction-site synergy whereby Ni sites facilitate the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O dissociation/OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; desorption and Cd&#8211;Ni bridge sites are active for the optimal H&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; adsorption and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve the ideal non-noble-metal HER electrocatalyst in alkaline media, developing conductive systems with multiple active sites targeting every elementary step in the alkaline HER, is highly desirable but remains a great challenge. Herein, a conductive noble metal-free antiperovskite CdNNi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is reported with intrinsic metallic characteristics as a highly efficient alkaline HER electrocatalyst, which is designed by the facile A-site tuning strategy with the modulation the electronic structures and interfacial water configurations of antiperovskites. Impressively, the HER performance of CdNNi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; antiperovskite is superior to various state-of-the-art non-noble metal catalysts ever reported, and also outperforms the commercial Raney Ni catalyst when assemble as the cathode in the practical anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) device. With insights from comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations, the CdNNi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can create synergistic dual active sites for catalyzing different elementary steps of the alkaline HER; namely, the Ni site can effectively facilitate the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O dissociation and OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; desorption, while the unusual Cd&#8211;Ni bridge site is active for the optimal H&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; adsorption and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution. Such multifunction-site synergy, together with inherent high electrical conductivity, enables the CdNNi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; antiperovskite to fulfill the essential criteria for an ideal non-noble-metal alkaline HER electrocatalyst with excellent performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Thermodynamically Self&#8208;Assembly Hydration&#8208;Cycle Crystals for Multidimensional Off&#8208;Grid Water&#8208;Energy Nexus</title>

         <dc:description>
Recyclable hydrophilic coordination scaffolds (RHCS) for sustainable water&#8208;energy systems are presented. The Ca2+&#8208;SO42&#8722; bilayer, stabilized by dynamic hydrogen bonds, enables: 1) 44% lower evaporation enthalpy via asymmetric hydration, 2) ambient self&#8208;assembly of superhydrophilic substrates, and 3) temperature&#8208;responsive regeneration. RHCS reduces energy use by 1&#8211;2 orders versus conventional systems, which offer a closed&#8208;loop solution to global water&#8208;energy challenges.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation (SDIE) technology shows water&#8208;energy solution potential but faces industrialization barriers from substrate scalability limits. Here, a regenerative hydrated coordination scaffold (R&#8208;HCS) is presented that redefines material design by leveraging water molecules as dynamic structural directors throughout the material lifecycle. Unlike conventional hydrogel/aerogel systems requiring energy&#8208;intensive crosslinking (&#8722;&#916;E = 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude) or freeze&#8208;drying processes, R&#8208;HCS forms spontaneously through water&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly of calcium sulfate under ambient conditions. Hydration shells drive hierarchical crystallization while fundamentally restructuring hydrogen&#8208;bond networks, achieving a 44% reduction in water evaporation enthalpy. The framework demonstrates unique thermal reconfiguration, exhibiting reversible dissociation&#8208;reassembly behavior (&gt;100 &#176;C threshold) that enables full material regeneration (performance decay &lt; 5%) using solar thermal energy/waste heat without chemical additives. Crucially, RHCS maintains exceptional ligand stability even when utilizing natural seawater. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, an R&#8208;HCS integrated passive evaporation module achieves 77.2% water recovery under 1 sun irradiation, coupled with 30 &#176;C thermal assembly temperature reduction at 1.5 sun intensity. Concurrently, crystallizer units maintain stable 2.31&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 evaporation rates in 3.5 wt% brine. This water&#8208;centric design paradigm establishes a new class of adaptive materials where solvent&#8211;solute interactions become the driving force for circular water&#8208;energy systems, potentially redefining sustainable infrastructure for off&#8208;grid regions.

         <title>Steric Hindrance&#8208;Induced Amorphous Lithium Sulfide Deposition Accelerates Sulfur Redox Kinetics in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strong coordination between benzo&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 and Li+ generates the steric hindrance effect, successfully enabling the amorphous deposition of lithium sulfide (Li2S). This approach restructures the energy level distribution of Li2S, synchronously optimizing its molecular orbital energies and inducing uniform nucleation and growth. Consequently, it significantly reduces the kinetic barriers along the Li2S deposition pathway.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#9472;S) batteries are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage due to their ultrahigh theoretical energy density. However, their practical application is severely hindered by the sluggish conversion kinetics, particularly during the crystalline lithium sulfide (Li2S) formation stage. Herein, a steric hindrance&#8208;mediated engineering strategy is proposed that induces an amorphous Li2S deposition process, effectively boosting the sulfur redox kinetics in Li&#9472;S batteries. By introducing benzo&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 (B15C5) as an electrolyte additive, a strong coordination between B15C5 and lithium ion (Li+) is established, which creates spatial confinement around Li2S and disrupts the crystallinity of Li2S during its deposition. Synchrotron pair distribution function analysis combined with in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals that the deposited Li2S with B15C5 exhibits significant local disorder with irregular Li&#9472;S bond oscillations, confirming the generation of an amorphous phase. This strategy not only ensures a uniform Li2S layer at the cathode/electrolyte interface but also lowers the energy barrier of sulfur species at the molecular scale, enabling the Li&#9472;S batteries with excellent cycling stability and overall enhanced sulfur reaction kinetics. This work provides a novel pathway for overcoming the intrinsic limitations of sluggish cathode conversion kinetics of Li&#9472;S batteries, paving the way for their practical deployment in high&#8208;performance energy storage applications.

         <title>eg Electron Occupancy as a Descriptor for Designing Iron Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An eg electron occupancy descriptor for Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C is proposed to link the reaction rate of the electrocatalytic reduction reaction. This descriptor provides guidelines for the rational design of single&#8208;atom catalysts for the ORR as well as various other processes, showing great promise for advancing metal&#8208;air batteries to practical applications.








Abstract
A quantitative electronic structure&#8208;performance relationship is highly desired for the design of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). The Fe single&#8208;atom catalysts supported by ordered mesoporous carbon with the eg electron occupancy from 1.7 to 0.7 are synthesized. A linear relationship has been established between the eg electron occupancy of the Fe site and the catalytic activity/activation entropy of oxygen&#8208;related intermediates. Fe SAC with an eg electron occupancy of 0.7 alters the rate determining step from *OH desorption to *OOH formation. The value of the turn&#8208;over frequency is &#8776;28 times that of the Fe SAC site with an eg electron occupancy of 1.7 e, and the mass activity is &#8776;6.3 times that of commercial Pt/C. When used in a zinc&#8211;air battery, the Fe SAC gives a remarkable power density of 196.3&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and a long&#8208;term stability exceeding 1500&#160;h. The discovery of eg electron occupancy descriptor provides valuable insights for designing single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts.

         <title>Redox Oscillation Enhanced Water&#8208;Enabled Electric Generator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the bioelectrical phenomena based on the membrane potential variations and the glucose oxidation/reduction reactions, a redox oscillation enhanced water&#8208;enabled electric generator is proposed. The oscillating redox process not only boosts the ion&#8208;electron conversion at the interface but also realizes the synergy between the non&#8208;Faraday and Faraday current. The generator achieves an impressive peak electric output of 1.20 mA cm&#8722;2 and 0.41 W m&#8722;2 for 60 days.








Abstract
The energy crisis driven by the widespread use of fossil fuels highlights the urgent need for green energy solutions. A variety of green electric generators based on interfacial ion regulation have emerged in recent years. However, conventional electricity generation methods that rely solely on ion movement at interfaces suffer from a rapid decline in electrical signals due to poor ion&#8208;electron conversion at the interface.

The oscillating redox process not only boosts the ion-electron conversion at the interface but also realizes the synergy between the non-Faraday and Faraday current. The generator achieves an impressive peak electric output of 1.20 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 0.41 W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 60 days.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The energy crisis driven by the widespread use of fossil fuels highlights the urgent need for green energy solutions. A variety of green electric generators based on interfacial ion regulation have emerged in recent years. However, conventional electricity generation methods that rely solely on ion movement at interfaces suffer from a rapid decline in electrical signals due to poor ion-electron conversion at the interface. Inspired by the bioelectrical phenomena based on the variations in membrane potential and the glucose oxidation/reduction reactions, a redox oscillation enhanced water-enabled electric generator is herein proposed. The oscillating redox process not only boosts the ion-electron conversion at the interface but also enables the synergy between the non-Faraday current and the Faraday current. As a result, the generator achieves an impressive peak electric output of 1.20 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 0.41 W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 60 days, outperforming various water-enabled electric generators. Furthermore, this generator can be integrated into a flexible unit for both portable and large-scale applications. This work presents a novel approach for enhancing the output of green energy devices based on interfacial ion migration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modularized Cathode with Neural Network Topology for High Rate and Fault&#8208;Tolerant Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>

In this study, a modular electrode system is designed by employing nanozyme&#8208;embedded microreactor units as independent reaction modules and establishing a fully connected cascaded neural network topology to enable efficient inter&#8208;module interconnection and synergistic optimization.








Abstract
Enhancing the redox kinetics of electrodes, achieving synergistic optimization of local energy conversion and overall charge transfer, and overcoming the technical bottleneck of significant performance degradation due to local unit failure in traditional electrode systems are crucial for developing high&#8208;rate lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. Here, a modular cathode system (CoB1N3&#8208;MR/FNN) with a fully connected cascade neural network topology (FNN) is designed by constructing microreactor modules (CoB1N3&#8208;MRs) with embedded nanozymes (Co&#8208;B1N3), ordering and efficiently interconnecting them. This system not only enables efficient energy conversion within individual microreactors but also significantly enhances the long&#8208;range charge transport efficiency and energy aggregation capacity of the electrodes. Furthermore, CoB1N3&#8208;MR/FNN achieves fault tolerance to local damage through its distributed energy storage units and redundant charge transport channels. This synergistically enhanced modular electrode system for energy conversion and charge transport exhibits high specific discharge capacity (0.2 C, 1211 mAh g&#8722;1) and excellent rate capability (5 C, 731.26 mAh g&#8722;1; 10 C, 471.05 mAh g&#8722;1), and shows outstanding electrochemical performances in high sulfur loading, low electrolytes, and flexible pouch batteries (0.2 C, 1165 mAh g&#8722;1), fully demonstrating its practical application value.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Out&#8208;Of&#8208;Plane Ferroelectricity in 1T&#8242;/1H MoS2 Heterophase Bilayer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectricity is observed in 1T&#8242;/1H MoS2 bilayers synthesized via chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The phenomenon is confirmed through structural analysis using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG), as well as switching behavior characterized by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ) measurements. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the ferroelectricity originates from interlayer sliding. This discovery extends the scope of 2D ferroelectrics to vertically stacked heterophase systems, offering new opportunities for exploring coupled phenomena in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs).








Abstract
The emergence of heterophase 2D materials, distinguished by their unique structures, has led to the discovery of a multitude of intriguing physical properties and a broad range of potential applications. Here, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectricity is uncovered in a heterophase structure of 1T&#8242;/1H MoS2, which is synthesized via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) by tuning the formation energies for MoS2 with varied phases. The atomically resolved structures of the obtained 1T&#8242;/1H MoS2 bilayers are captured using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and are confirmed to be non&#8208;centrosymmetric using second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) characterizations. The intrinsic out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization is visualized by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), which reveals that ferroelectric domains can be manipulated under an applied electric field. Ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ) devices fabricated on these bilayers exhibit reversible switching between a high resistance state (HRS) and a low resistance state (LRS). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidate that the intrinsic ferroelectricity in 1T&#8242;/1H bilayers is attributed to interlayer sliding and lattice mismatch. The findings not only expand the scope of 2D ferroelectrics to include vertically stacked heterophase bilayers but also open avenues for exploring the coupling effect between ferroelectricity and other phenomena such as magnetism, superconductivity, and photocatalysis in 2D heterophase TMDCs.

         <title>Retarding the Growth Kinetics of Chemical Bath Deposited Nickel Oxide Films for Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells and Minimodules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amino&#8208;alcohol ligand with strong binding affinity to Ni2+ is employed to modulate the growth kinetics of chemical bath deposited NiOx for preparing compact NiOx film with superior coverage, enhanced conductivity and reduced defect density, finally realizing the highest efficiency of 26.53% along with great operational stability and scalability for the champion device based on NiOx/SAM hole transport layer.








Abstract
The interfacial contact between the hole transport layer (HTL) and perovskite layer plays a critical role in determining the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, to address the limitations of commercial NiOx nanoparticles and realize low temperature fabrication of compact NiOx film, a chemical bath deposition (CBD) approach is employed and strategically modified. By introducing an amino&#8208;alcohol ligand of triisopropanolamine (TPA) into the precursor, the deposition process is effectively controlled. TPA binds strongly with Ni2+ ions, facilitating their gradual release and promoting the in situ formation of a compact Ni(OH)2 intermediate. This retarded growth kinetics yield high&#8208;quality NiOx films with enhanced coverage, increased conductivity, and reduced trap&#8208;state. The films also feature abundant hydroxyl groups, providing sufficient anchoring sites for MeO&#8208;2PACz. Based on this bilayer HTL, a PCE of 26.53% (certified 26.44%) with improved operational stability is achieved for the 0.09&#160;cm2 device, marking the highest efficiency for inverted PSCs based on CBD NiOx. Furthermore, the strategy demonstrates excellent scalability, delivering efficiencies of 24.75% for a 1&#160;cm2 device and 22.96% for a 12.96&#160;cm2 minimodule. This work provides a facile but effective CBD approach for preparing high&#8208;quality NiOx films, offering a promising and scalable pathway for inverted PSCs.

         <title>Interfacial Charge Transfer in ZnO/COF S&#8208;Scheme Photocatalyst via Zn&#9472;N Bond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals the role of interfacial Zn&#9472;N bonds in enhancing charge transfer and optimizing energy band alignment in S&#8208;scheme ZnO/covalent organic framework heterojunctions. Theoretical calculations, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy confirm the mechanism, providing molecular&#8208;level insights into charge transfer processes and guiding the design of efficient photocatalysts for artificial photosynthetic systems.








Abstract
Photocatalysis is a promising solution to global energy shortage and environmental problems. Inspired by photosynthesis, multicomponent heterostructured photocatalysts are extensively investigated, and step&#8208;scheme (S&#8208;scheme) heterojunction has emerged as the theoretical basis for delineating charge transfer processes in predominant heterostructured photocatalysts. However, the specific charge transfer pathway across an S&#8208;scheme heterojunction remains elusive from an atomic/molecular perspective. Herein, it is demonstrated that in S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalysts composed of imine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks and nanostructured zinc oxide, interfacial Zn&#9472;N bonds are formed between the two components and play critical roles as a charge transfer gateway in the S&#8208;scheme heterojunction, based on theoretical calculations, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Moreover, mechanisms for enhanced charge transfer across the S&#8208;scheme heterojunction are elucidated using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy.

&lt;p&gt;This work reveals the role of interfacial Zn&lt;i&gt;&#9472;&lt;/i&gt;N bonds in enhancing charge transfer and optimizing energy band alignment in S-scheme ZnO/covalent organic framework heterojunctions. Theoretical calculations, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy confirm the mechanism, providing molecular-level insights into charge transfer processes and guiding the design of efficient photocatalysts for artificial photosynthetic systems.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photocatalysis is a promising solution to global energy shortage and environmental problems. Inspired by photosynthesis, multicomponent heterostructured photocatalysts are extensively investigated, and step-scheme (S-scheme) heterojunction has emerged as the theoretical basis for delineating charge transfer processes in predominant heterostructured photocatalysts. However, the specific charge transfer pathway across an S-scheme heterojunction remains elusive from an atomic/molecular perspective. Herein, it is demonstrated that in S-scheme heterojunction photocatalysts composed of imine-based covalent organic frameworks and nanostructured zinc oxide, interfacial Zn&lt;i&gt;&#9472;&lt;/i&gt;N bonds are formed between the two components and play critical roles as a charge transfer gateway in the S-scheme heterojunction, based on theoretical calculations, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Moreover, mechanisms for enhanced charge transfer across the S-scheme heterojunction are elucidated using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. This work provides new insights into molecular-level understanding of charge transfer mechanisms in S-scheme heterojunction photocatalysts for promoting energy and environmental applications of artificial photosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fast Screening Suitable Doping Transition Metals to Na3V2(PO4)2F3 for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries with High Energy Density in Wide&#8208;Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new computational prediction&#8208;assisted chemical synthesis&#160;strategy&#160;quickly screens for Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF), and verified by experiments with dopants like Ru, Fe, Ni, and others. The mechanism follows a multi&#8208;phase and solid&#8208;solution reaction with minimal strain variation. Compromising the cost and performance, NVPF&#8208;Fe is regarded as the optimized cathode candidate for sodium&#8208;ion batteries with high energy density features for wide&#8208;temperature application.








Abstract
Screening the suitable doping elements for Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) through the traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error method to enhance its intrinsic electronic conductivity and electrochemical performance is a time&#8208;exhausted task. Here, a new strategy of theoretical prediction&#8208;assisted chemical synthesis is proposed to fast filter the suitable doping elements to NVPF by first calculating the band gaps of various transition metals doped NVPF and then verifying by the experimental results. Single crystal NVPF&#8208;M (Na3V1.85M0.15(PO4)2F3, M = Ru, Fe, Ni, Ti, and Cd, etc.) materials are synthesized to compare their electrochemical performances. Excellent cycling performance (2000 cycles with high Coulombic efficiencies), remarkable rate capacity (20 C), and wide&#8208;temperature range (&#8722;30&#8211;60&#160;&#176;C) application capability are witnessed in the NVPF&#8208;Ru/Fe cathodes in both half and full cells. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns have confirmed that they followed the consisting of multi&#8208;phase reactions (Na3 &#8596; Na2.4 &#8596; Na2.2 &#8596; Na1) and a solid&#8208;solution reaction (Na1.8 &#8596; Na1.3) with small changes of lattice volume and strains. Compromising the cost and performance, the NVPF&#8208;Fe cathode is regarded as the optimized cathode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries with a high energy density and wide temperature application features.

         <title>Selective Urea Electrosynthesis from CO2 and Nitrate on Spin&#8208;Polarized Atomically Ordered PdCuCo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomically ordered, spin&#8208;polarized Co&#8208;doped PdCu intermetallic compound is rationally synthesized. The introduction of spin&#8208;polarized Co atoms can enhance the *NO binding and hydrogenation on its N&#8208;side to form *HNO, which further produces *NH2OH. The subsequent coupling of *CO and *NH2OH leads to the efficient and stable formation of urea.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic conversion of NO3&#8722; and CO2 into urea features a potential means of reducing carbon footprint and generating value&#8208;added chemicals. Nonetheless, due to the limited efficiency of carbon&#8722;nitrogen (C&#9472;N) coupling and the competing side reaction that forms ammonia, the urea selectivity and production yield have remained low. In this work, a spin&#8722;polarized cobalt&#8722;doped, atomically ordered PdCu intermetallic compound (denoted as PdCuCo) is developed as an efficient urea electrosynthesis catalyst. The Pd and Cu serve as the adsorption sites for CO2 and NO3&#8722;, respectively, and the spin&#8722;polarized Co sites promote the adsorption of *NO intermediate, followed by hydrogenation of *NO at its N&#8722;terminal to form *HNO, instead of at its O&#8722;terminal. The difference in the hydrogenation position switches the subsequent reaction pathway to produce urea, in contrast to the PdCu or Ni&#8722;doped PdCu intermetallic compounds with main product selectivity of ammonia. The PdCuCo electrocatalyst exhibited an outstanding electrosynthesis of urea from NO3&#8722; and CO2, including a Faradaic efficiency of 81%, a high urea yield of 227&#160;mmol gcat.&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, and a notable electrochemical stability of &gt;260 h, suggesting the attractive potential of designing spin&#8722;polarized catalytic sites for carbon&#8722;nitrogen coupling processes.

         <title>Molecularly Engineered Rigid Ultra&#8208;Micropore Membranes for Ultrahigh&#8208;Power Osmotic Energy Harvesting from High&#8208;Temperature Hypersaline Brine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rigid ultra&#8208;micropores are constructed by confining the semi&#8208;rigid sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) molecules in graphene oxide nanochannels and fixing them with an amphiphilic molecule. The power density of the membrane can reach up to 371.65 W m&#8722;2 with high temperature (60 &#176;C) hypersaline brine (5M/0.5M), which can be obtained from a solar stiller.








Abstract
Osmotic energy is a promising renewable energy source for its giant reserves and can be easily harvested with ion selective membranes. However, the output power density in membrane&#8208;scale applications is always below 10 W m&#8722;2 due to the high resistance from low salinity solution and the serious concentration polarization phenomenon. Here, this study shows that rigid ultra&#8208;micropores can greatly improve the output power density of the osmotic energy conversion process with high&#8208;temperature hypersaline brine. The membrane with rigid ultra&#8208;micropores is constructed by confining the high&#8208;content semi&#8208;rigid sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) molecules in graphene oxide nanochannels and fixing them with amphiphilic molecules. The output power density of the membrane can be as high as 175.1 W m&#8722;2 with an energy conversion efficiency of 44.5% at the salinity gradient of 5 M/0.5 M, which can further increase to 371.65 W m&#8722;2 when the solution temperature is up to 60 &#176;C. This study also demonstrates that the high&#8208;temperature hypersaline brine can be obtained from a passive solar stiller. The molecular engineering of ion selective membranes and the optimization strategy of the reverse electrodialysis process will inspire the development of a next&#8208;generation osmotic energy harvesting system.

         <title>Modulating Coupled Polyhedral Distortion in Li&#8208;Rich Cathodes for Synergistically Inhibiting Capacity and Voltage Decay</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on density functional theory calculations, machine learning, and experimental validation, a general design approach is provided to suppress performance degradation by modulating coupled polyhedral distortion in layered cathode materials. The developed Li&#8208;rich cathode exhibits remarkable long&#8208;term capacity and voltage stability, with 95.8% capacity retention after 300 cycles and 0.02% voltage decay per cycle.








Abstract
Achieving significant enhancements in both capacity and voltage stability remains a formidable challenge for Li&#8208;rich layered cathodes. The severe performance degradation is attributed to large lattice strain, irreversible oxygen release and transition metal migration, but the most critical factor responsible for structural destabilization is still elusive.

&lt;p&gt;Based on density functional theory calculations, machine learning, and experimental validation, a general design approach is provided to suppress performance degradation by modulating coupled polyhedral distortion in layered cathode materials. The developed Li-rich cathode exhibits remarkable long-term capacity and voltage stability, with 95.8% capacity retention after 300 cycles and 0.02% voltage decay per cycle.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving significant enhancements in both capacity and voltage stability remains a formidable challenge for Li-rich layered cathodes. The severe performance degradation is attributed to large lattice strain, irreversible oxygen release and transition metal migration, but the most critical factor responsible for structural destabilization is still elusive. Here, based on density functional theory calculations, machine learning and experimental validation, a multi-hierarchy screening of complex multi-element doping systems is developed from electrochemical activity, lattice strain, oxygen stability and transition metal migration barrier. It is further identified that the coupled polyhedral distortion parameter D+&#963;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the substitution element is the most significant feature that affects the structural stability during cycling. The Li-rich layered cathode developed based on the predicted results exhibits remarkable long-term capacity stability (95.8% capacity retention over 300 cycles) and negligible voltage loss (0.02% voltage decay per cycle). This study provides a general approach by modulating coupled polyhedral distortion for the rational design of cathode materials and can be expanded to the discovery of other advanced electrodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Significantly Enhanced Density and Mechanical Strength of Carbon/Graphite Blocks by Waste Gas Pressurized Sintering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The waste gas generated during carbonization in an enclosed space forms a high internal pressure, thereby effectively promoting the polymerization and densification of the carbon block. This self&#8208;generated pressure, known as waste gas pressurization (WGP), ensures tighter bonding between carbon particles, lower porosity, and obviously higher mechanical strength without the participation of external gas or mechanical compression.








Abstract
Carbonization under pressure is crucial for enhancing carbon/graphite materials. However, conventional pressure sintering, relying on mechanical or external gas pressure, often results in incomplete densification and structural defects due to uncontrolled volatile gas release. Herein, high&#8208;density and high&#8208;strength self&#8208;sintered carbon block in enclosed&#8208;space (SCB&#8208;E) are produced using waste gas pressurization (WGP) derived from green petroleum coke (GPC). This method can enhance the formation of C&#9472;O&#9472;C and C&#9552;O bonds by promoting dehydration polymerization reaction, which induces interfacial bonding in the carbonization process. Consequently, a decreased mass loss, increased volume shrinkage, and reduced porosity are observed, thereby endowing the obtained SCB&#8208;E with significantly improved density and mechanical strength. Specifically, the compressive and flexural strengths of SCB&#8208;E are 6.36 and 5.77 times higher than SCB&#8208;O sintered in open&#8208;space, respectively, while the corresponding graphite block (SG&#8208;E) achieves 7.74 and 4.58 times greater compressive and flexural strengths than SG&#8208;O. Notably, WGP not only enhances the yield of crack&#8208;free carbon blocks and supports scale&#8208;up production but also integrates seamlessly with traditional kneading processes to produce high&#8208;density, high&#8208;strength carbon blocks (CB&#8208;E). The current approach offers an innovative and important platform for enhancing the density and mechanical properties of bulk materials.

         <title>Conjugated Side&#8208;Chains Optimize Giant Acceptor Compatibility with Low&#8208;Cost Polymer Donor to Overcome the Cost&#8208;Efficiency&#8208;Stability Trilemma in Polymer Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
High&#8208;efficiency and stable polymer solar cells typically rely on expensive oligomeric small&#8208;molecule acceptors and high&#8208;cost polymer donors. To overcome this limitation, conjugated side chains are strategically employed to modulate and dimerize acceptors, precisely tuning their thermodynamic properties for optimal compatibility with the low&#8208;cost polymer donor PTQ10. This approach provides a viable pathway toward sustainable and renewable energy solutions.








Abstract
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) rely on blends of small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) and polymer donors, but the thermodynamic relaxation of SMAs requires an oligomeric approach to enhance operational stability. However, high&#8208;efficiency devices often depend on the expensive synthesis of oligomeric SMAs and costly polymer donors, posing a significant barrier to achieving sustainable and renewable energy. Here, the challenge is addressed through a thermodynamically derived compatibility of giant acceptors with the low&#8208;cost polymer donor PTQ10. This is achieved by strategically employing conjugated side chains to modulate and dimerize acceptors, thereby precisely tuning their thermodynamic properties to optimize compatibility. Our synthetic&#160;route avoids toxic reagents, halogenated solvents, and harsh conditions. The dimer (DYBT) incorporating an n&#8208;type linker enhances crystallinity, absorption, and intramolecular superexchange coupling compared to its p&#8208;type counterpart, and achieves a device efficiency of 19.53%. Considering efficiency, stability, and material cost, the potential cost per kilowatt for the PTQ10:DYBT device is 0.10 $&#160;kW&#8722;1, while most systems exceed 10 $&#160;kW&#8722;1. These findings offer valuable insights for the cost&#8208;effective oligomeric acceptors, to well pair with low&#8208;cost donors and reduce the overall material cost of the photo&#8208;active layer for sustainable and durable energy.

         <title>Multidimensional Modulation via&#160;Tailored Covalent Organic Frameworks Enables Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with 26.21% Efficiency</title>

         <dc:description>
A hydrazinelinked covalent organic framework (COF) is synthesized for the first time and integrated into perovskite for multidimensional regulation of crystallization, defect states, and charge separation, synergistically. Benefiting from the oriented crystallization, which eliminates defects, together with the optimized interfacial charge transfer, the optimal device achieves an excellent efficiency of 26.21% with greatly improved humidity, thermal, and illumination stabilities.








Abstract
Despite the remarkable advancements in inverted perovskite solar cells, their commercialization remains hindered by critical bottlenecks in efficiency and stability stemming from inadequate crystallization and unfavorable interfacial states. Herein, for the first time, a judiciously designed hydrazine&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF) with long alkane phosphate branch chains, named 12&#8208;SD&#8208;COF, is synthesized and integrated into the perovskite precursor to achieve multidimensional regulation of crystallization, defect states, and charge separation synergistically. It is found that the 12&#8208;SD&#8208;COF featuring periodic pores, large planar structure, and abundant binding groups is extruded from the precursor solution onto the buried interface, surface, and grain boundaries, facilitating oriented crystallization while eliminating defects of perovskites, thereby yielding high&#8208;quality crystals with suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination. Simultaneously, the interfacial charge separation is synergistically facilitated by the p&#8208;type doping&#8208;optimized energy level alignment and the induced intramolecular electric field, ultimately achieving an exceptional power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.21%, the highest yet reported for COF&#8208;modified. Impressively, the non&#8208;encapsulated resultant device delivers greatly improved stabilities, with maintaining over 92% of initial PCE after being aged under 85&#160;&#176;C continuous heating stress for 800&#160;h, 1000&#160;h in 50&#177;3% relative humidity air, and 1200&#160;h under continuous 1&#8208;sun illumination, respectively.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Melt&#8208;Processable Polymer Semiconductors with Large&#8208;Ring Crown Ether Side Chains for High&#8208;Performance Organic Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large&#8208;ring crown ether side chain is introduced to conjugated polymers to enable low&#8208;temperature melt processing while retaining high charge transport performance. The resulting polymers form highly aligned films via melt friction transfer, achieving enhanced mobility in organic transistors. This ecofriendly strategy supports scalable fabrication of high&#8208;performance polymer electronics with reduced solvent reliance.








Abstract
Polymer semiconductors are crucial components in organic electronics and have shown remarkable progress in recent years. However, their dependence on halogenated solvents for film processing raises environmental concerns and introduces risks of defects caused by residual solvent molecules during film drying. Melt processing has emerged as a sustainable alternative for fabricating polymer semiconductor films. Despite its potential, balancing low melting temperatures with high charge transport performance remains challenging, as high&#8208;performance polymers typically exhibit high melting points due to their rigid conjugated backbones. This study introduces a molecular design strategy incorporating large&#8208;ring crown ether (LCE) side chains to enhance the melt processability of conjugated polymers. This approach reduces the melt temperature to as low as 70 &#176;C while maintaining excellent charge transport performance. Highly aligned polymer films are fabricated using melt friction transfer processing and employed in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), achieving a carrier mobility of up to 1.06 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in the channel&#8208;parallel direction, approximately 2.5 times greater than their non&#8208;oriented counterparts. Aggregation structure characterizations reveal that these LCE side chains not only enable low melting temperature but also facilitate bimodal texture formation, creating 3D pathways for efficient charge transport. This strategy offers a scalable, eco&#8208;friendly approach to produce high&#8208;performance electronics.

Despite its potential, balancing low melting temperatures with high charge transport performance remains challenging, as high-performance polymers typically exhibit high melting points due to their rigid conjugated backbones. This study introduces a molecular design strategy incorporating large-ring crown ether (LCE) side chains to enhance the melt processability of conjugated polymers. This approach reduces the melt temperature to as low as 70 &#176;C while maintaining excellent charge transport performance. Highly aligned polymer films are fabricated using melt friction transfer processing and employed in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), achieving a carrier mobility of up to 1.06 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in the channel-parallel direction, approximately 2.5 times greater than their non-oriented counterparts. Aggregation structure characterizations reveal that these LCE side chains not only enable low melting temperature but also facilitate bimodal texture formation, creating 3D pathways for efficient charge transport. This strategy offers a scalable, eco-friendly approach to produce high-performance electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailoring Cold&#8208;Resilient Electrolytes Driven by Mechanisms Underlying Ice Melting for Cryogenic Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a fresh perspective from mechanisms of chemical ice melting identifies key criteria influencing the selection of effective solutes for the development of more reliable cold&#8208;resilient electrolytes. The screened ice&#8208;melting chemical potassium formate effectively enables the realization of ultra&#8208;stable reversibility in a low&#8208;temperature environment.








Abstract
The freezing and melting behaviors of aqueous solutions are strongly influenced by the presence of chemical substances, yet the criteria for screening effective chemicals remain poorly defined. This study introduces a novel perspective to designing cold&#8208;resilient electrolytes by focusing on the mechanisms underlying ice melting and identifying the key screening criteria, providing new insights into how specific chemicals can enhance the cryogenic properties of aqueous solutions. A series of theoretical and experimental tools highlight its superior low&#8208;temperature tolerance endowed by the screened chemical solute, and the pouch full cell Zn//pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone with cathode loading up to 7.5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 delivers an impressively high capacity of 110 mAh g&#8722;1 and excellent rate performance at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. This special work would enrich the design concepts and expand the paradigms of developing water&#8208;based energy storage systems in extreme environments.

         <title>Smart Lanthanide Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Multicolor Luminescence Switching Induced by the Dynamic Adaptive Antenna Effect of Molecular Rotors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic molecular rotors are used to construct smart lanthanide metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) emitters with adaptive antenna effects for the first time and precisely regulated the energy transfer pathways of Ln&#8208;MOFs to achieve efficient multicolor luminescence switching behavior, upconversion luminescence, multiple smart anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications, purity monitoring of commercial gadolinium salts, smart photoresponsive specific antibiotics and amino acids.








Abstract
In this work, dynamic molecular rotors are used to construct smart lanthanide metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) emitters with adaptive antenna effects for the first time. The movement or distortion of the molecular rotors can be easily regulated by temperature changes, thereby inducing a dynamically changing antenna effect that can automatically match different lanthanide ions, achieving cyclic multicolor luminescence switching behavior and extremely complex multiple encryption anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology. In addition, by regulating the doping ratios of Gd(III) and Tb(III) with Eu(III) within the Ln&#8208;MOFs, differentiated energy transfer pathways are discovered, and red light emission very close to the BT.2020 color gamut standard is obtained. Gd0.99Eu0.01&#8208;MOF containing only 1% Eu(III) can show bright red luminescence, and in the range of 1&#8211;9% Eu(III) content, the characteristic emission intensity of Eu(III) ions and the content show an excellent linear relationship with a slope k as high as 2299. This can be used to identify the content of Eu(III) ions impurities in gadolinium salts from different manufacturers. Eu/Tb&#8208;MOF showed highly sensitive and visualized smart photoresponse behaviors to specific antibiotics and amino acids, respectively, with detection limits of 3.2/2.7&#160;nM (tetracycline), 1.7/15.5&#160;nM (oxytetracycline), 0.13/0.97&#160;nM (aspartic acid), and 0.26/1.16&#160;nM (glutamic acid).

         <title>Efficient Interfacial Electrical Energy Extraction of a Triboelectric Nanogenerator by the Charge Lock&#8208;Free Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charge lock&#8208;free TENG is proposed, which has excellent electrical output performance and durability. This study provides a charge&#8208;lock&#8208;free strategy to effectively release the charge locked on the interface, which realizes efficient electrical energy extraction from sliding frictional interfaces.








Abstract
Sliding&#8208;mode triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) generate electricity by utilizing dynamic friction on the surface of dielectric materials, demonstrating notable potential for low&#8208;frequency mechanical energy harvesting. However, conventional device structures are limited by interface charge locking and low inherent capacitance, which results in a relatively low power density. Herein, the charge&#8208;locking mechanism is explored, and propose an innovative strategy for the dynamic interface shift between two materials with different polarities. When the interfaces overlap in the same materials, the locked interface charges are fully released. Based on this concept, a charge lock&#8208;free TENG (LF&#8208;TENG) is constructed. The output energy of the LF&#8208;TENG is 4.44 times that of the traditional sliding TENG. The rotating LF&#8208;TENG achieves an output charge and a current of 5 &#181;C, 100 &#181;A at 60 rpm, and an average power density of 9 W m&#8722;2 Hz&#8722;1 at 70 M&#937;. Furthermore, the equivalent circuit model is analyzed and it is found that the capacitance change of the LF&#8208;TENG is twice that of traditional devices, which is the main factor for the increase in the output power. This study provides valuable insights into efficient electrical energy extraction from sliding frictional interfaces and paves the way for the development of low&#8208;frequency mechanical energy&#8208;collection technologies.

         <title>Dual Active Site Engineering in Porous NiW Bimetallic Alloys for Enhanced Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous NiW bimetallic alloy with dual active site engineering is reported as an efficient electrocatalyst for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction. The alloying of Ni with W enhances H2O dissociation and *OH desorption at the W site, while also facilitating the generation of more available H* intermediates at the Ni2W1 hollow site, thereby improving the hydrogen evolution activity of the porous NiW bimetallic alloy. Notably, a high solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency of 16.59% is achieved in a NiW&#8208;incorporated solar&#8208;driven water splitting system.








Abstract
Utilizing dual active sites in electrocatalysts creates a synergistic effect, enabling the independent optimization of H2O dissociation and intermediate adsorption/desorption, which in turn enhances the efficiency of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, a porous NiW bimetallic alloy electrocatalyst using a dynamic H2 bubble template (DHBT) strategy is fabricated. This electrocatalyst capitalizes on the synergistic effect of dual active sites, achieving industrial&#8208;level current densities of 500 and 1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for HER in 1.0&#160;M KOH, with low overpotentials of 198 and 264&#160;mV, respectively. It also demonstrates excellent stability over a 200&#160;h test. Theoretical studies reveal that alloying Ni with W shifts the d&#8208;band center (&#949;d) of the W 5d orbital downward, which enhances *OH intermediate desorption and promotes H2O adsorption and dissociation at the W site, leading to increased active site availability. Meanwhile, this shift provides more accessible H* intermediates, further enhancing H2 production at the Ni2W1 hollow site. When the porous NiW bimetallic alloy electrocatalyst is implemented in a solar&#8208;driven water splitting system, it achieves a high solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of 16.59%. This work underscores the effectiveness of dual active site electrocatalysts for sustainable H2 production.

         <title>Ultrathin Electrolyte Membranes With Reinforced Concrete Structure for Fast&#8208;Charging Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, an ultrathin solid electrolyte inspired by reinforced concrete is developed, which integrates a nanostructured ceramic conductor and crosslinked polymer chains to induce a rapid multidimensional lithium&#8208;ion transport network. The synergistic ceramic&#8208;polymer framework uniformly stabilizes the structure, enabling dendrite&#8208;free plating/stripping and excellent interfacial stability. The optimized unique ion migration hopping mechanism facilitates the rapid transport of lithium&#8208;ion within the electrolyte, resulting in both stable and fast charging/discharging performance.








Abstract
Realizing solid&#8208;state lithium (Li) metal batteries with fast charging capability and desirable energy density remains a key challenge for emerging applications for drones and consumer electronics, which require solid electrolytes to maintain good ionic conductivity and mechanical integrity with fast reaction kinetics. Herein, an 8.4&#160;&#181;m ultrathin solid electrolyte membrane is manifested with a reinforced concrete structure and expedited ion hopping migration capability, enabling the solid&#8208;state battery with fast charging capability. The rapid multi&#8208;dimensional Li&#8208;ion transportation network is well&#8208;constructed based on nanosized ceramic conductor aggregation and polymer chain induction, which allows homogenized Li+ distribution on the interface with a continuous uniform and steady plating/stripping process, thereby enhancing interfacial stability and inhibiting dendrite growth. Attributed to its structural superiorities, the assembled solid&#8208;state lithium metal battery maintains an excellent capacity retention rate of 89.2% after 1300 cycles at 10 C. A 1.2 Ah pouch cell is fabricated with a high energy density of 415.2&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and also capable of cycling at 5 C, showing great potential for the practical application of solid&#8208;state batteries for next&#8208;generation energy storage devices.

         <title>An Implantable In&#8208;Hydrogel Wireless Supercapacitor&#8208;Activated Neuron System Enables Bidirectional Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An implantable wireless supercapacitor&#8208;activated neuro (W&#8208;SCAN) system consisting of the coil, diode bridge circuit, in&#8208;hydrogel supercapacitor, and stimulation electrodes has been developed for neuronal excitation and inhibition. By applying an adjustable electric field to stimulation electrodes, a spontaneously induced ionic oscillatory stimulation within tissue fluids is generated, which enables electro&#8208;interventional therapy for brain&#8208;related neurological disorders.








Abstract
The bidirectional modulation of cerebral neurons in the brain possesses enhancement and inhibition of neural activity, which is of great interest in the treatment of motor nerve disorders and emotional disorders, and cognitive defects. However, existing approaches usually rely on electrical/electrochemical stimulations, which show low security by implanting metal probes and unidirectional currents with single modulation. Herein, an implantable in&#8208;hydrogel wireless supercapacitor&#8208;activated neuron system consisting of the coil, diode bridge circuit, in&#8208;hydrogel supercapacitor, and stimulation electrodes is fabricated, which provides a bidirectional and adjustable ion diffusion current to safely and effectively excite and inhibit brain neurons. The designed in&#8208;hydrogel supercapacitor exhibits a high storage charge ability of &#8776;90 times larger than the devices without hydrogel encapsulation, owing to the in situ radical addition mechanism. Moreover, the in&#8208;hydrogel electrodes are implanted into the thalamus, amygdala, and prefrontal lobes of the brain to evoke the corresponding changes in potential intensity and frequency through the external chargeable coil and diode bridge circuit, which verifies the potential of the multimodule supercapacitor in amelioration and treatment Parkinson's, severe depression, and Alzheimer's disease.

         <title>Spin&#8208;State Manipulation of Atomic Manganese Center by Phosphide&#8208;Support Interactions for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic configuration of Mn single&#8208;atom sites is regulated from low&#8208;spin to high&#8208;spin states by embedding well&#8208;defined molybdenum phosphide nanocrystals nearby (MoP@MnSAC&#8208;NC). The electronic phosphide&#8208;support interaction between MoP and Mn single atoms drives the electronic structure transition in Mn sites from low&#8208;spin to high&#8208;spin states, and this transition expedites both O2 adsorption and OH&#8722; desorption. The MoP@MnSAC&#8208;NC displays an outstanding alkaline oxygen reduction reaction performance.








Abstract
Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics are closely related to the electronic structure of active sites. Herein, a single&#8208;atomic Mn catalyst decorated with adjacent MoP nanocrystals (MoP@MnSAC&#8208;NC) is reported. The decoration of MoP drives the electronic structure transition of Mn sites from low&#8208;spin to high&#8208;spin states through an electronic phosphide&#8208;support interaction. The rearranged electron occupation in 3dxz&#8208;yz and 3dz2 orbitals of Mn sites leads to electrons occupying the &#963; orbital in Mn&#9472;*O2, thereby favoring O2 adsorption to initiate the ORR mechanism. In situ characterizations confirm that Mn 3dz2 orbital occupation state can activate molecular O&#8322; and optimize the adsorption of the *OOH intermediate. As a result, the MoP@MnSAC&#8208;NC displays an outstanding alkaline ORR half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2 = 0.894 V), excellent peak power densities (173/83 mW cm&#8722;2 for liquid/solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;air batteries, respectively), and long&#8208;term stability (840 h) superior to commercial Pt/C. This work provides profound insights into spintronics&#8208;level engineering, guiding the design of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance ORR catalysts.

Topological Semimetal Nanowires
TaAs2 nanowires in situ encapsulated with a SiO2 shell display giant magnetoresistance, coherent surface transport, Aharonov&#8208;Bohm oscillations, and various signatures of intertwined topological phases: a weak topological insulator with a pair of quantized surface Dirac cones, bulk Weyl cones, and a C2&#8208;protected pair of surface Dirac cones. The frontispiece shows the structure of a core&#8208;shell TaAs2&#8208;SiO2 nanowire with the topological phases as insets, and a micrograph of the real as&#8208;grown nanowires at the background. More details can be found in article number 2418279 by Anand Roy, Ernesto Joselevich, and co&#8208;workers.

Metal&#8208;Assisted Chemical Etching
This cover shows metal&#8208;assisted chemical etching as sculpture. The bust&#8212;rough on one side, precisely faceted on the other&#8212;illustrates how catalyst shape affects silicon etching. The uneven side depicts problematic dendrite catalysts causing lateral etching, while the geometric side shows results after 450&#176;C treatment, which transforms dendrites into hemispherical forms for perfect vertical etching. More details can be found in article number 2502840 by Taehyo Kim, Han&#8208;Don Um, and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Engineering Flow&#8208;Through Hollow Fiber Gas&#8208;Diffusion Electrodes for Unlocking High&#8208;Rate Gas&#8208;Phase Electrochemical Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advancing gas&#8208;phase electrolysis toward industrial&#8208;scale applications requires not only the development of advanced electrocatalysts but also the design of the electrodes to optimize gas&#8208;electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces and facilitate efficient mass transport, thereby reinforcing gas win the electrons to promote reaction kinetics and suppress side reactions. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the design criteria, fabrication methods, and design strategies for emerging flow&#8208;through hollow fiber gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes.








Abstract
Designing advanced electrodes with efficient contact with gas, electrolytes, and catalysts presents significant opportunities to enhance the accessibility of concentrated gas molecules to the catalytic sites while mitigating undesirable side reactions such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which advances the gas&#8208;phase electrochemical reduction toward industrial&#8208;scale applications. Traditional planar electrodes face challenges, including limited gas solubility and restricted mass transport. Although commercial flow&#8208;by gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes can reduce mass transfer resistance by enabling direct diffusion of gas molecules to active sites, the reliance on diffusive gas flow becomes insufficient to meet the rapid consumption demands of gas reactants at high current density. Flow&#8208;through hollow fiber gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes (HFGDEs) or hollow fiber gas penetration electrodes (HFGPEs) provide a promising solution by continuously delivering convective gas flow to active sites, resulting in enhanced mass transport and superior gas accessibility near the catalytic sites. Notably, HFGDEs have demonstrated the ability to achieve current densities exceeding multiple amperes per square centimeter in liquid electrolytes. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the design criteria, fabrication methods, and design strategies for porous metallic HFGDEs. It highlights the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advancements in HFGDEs composed of various metals (e.g., Cu, Ni, Ag, Bi, Ti, and Zn), with a particular focus on their utilization in the electrochemical conversion of CO2. Finally, future research directions are discussed, underscoring the potential of porous metallic HFGDEs as a versatile and scalable electrode architecture for diverse electrochemical applications.

         <title>Advanced Microporous Framework Membranes for Sustainable Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the latest advancements in microporous material&#8208;based membranes, focusing on their applications in hydrocarbon separation, molecular sieving, and ion separation. It highlights the innovative membrane design methods and membrane separation performance, along with current challenges and perspectives on the future directions in the field of microporous membranes.








Abstract
Advancements in membrane&#8208;based separation hinge on the design of materials that transcend conventional limitations. Microporous materials, including metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent&#8211;organic frameworks (COFs), macrocycles, and porous organic cages (POCs) offer unprecedented control over pore architecture, chemical functionality, and transport properties, making them promising candidates for next&#8208;generation membrane technologies. The well&#8208;defined and tunable micropores provide a pathway to directly address the permeability&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off inherent in conventional polymer membranes. Here, this review explores the latest advancements in these four representative microporous membranes, emphasizing their breakthroughs in hydrocarbon separation, liquid&#8208;phase molecular sieving, and ion&#8208;selective transport, particularly focusing on their structure&#8208;performance relationships. While their tailored structures enable exceptional performance, practical adoption requires overcoming hurdles in scalability, durability, and compatibility with industrial processes. By offering insights into membrane structure optimization and innovative design strategies, this review provides a roadmap for advancing microporous membranes from laboratory innovation to real&#8208;world implementation, ultimately supporting global sustainability goals through energy&#8208;efficient separation processes.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art overview of halide perovskite&#8208;based photocatalysts for hydrogen production from water and halogen acid solutions, CO2 reduction into value&#8208;added chemicals, and organic chemical transformations. Different types of halide perovskite photocatalysts and their relative efficiencies for hydrogen generation and CO2 reduction, design strategies to overcome the instability issues in polar solvents and outstanding challenges are discussed.








Abstract
The need to constrain the use of fossil fuels causing global warming is motivating the development of a variety of photocatalysts for solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel generation and chemical synthesis. In particular, semiconductor&#8208;based photocatalysts have been extensively exploited in solar&#8208;driven organic synthesis, carbon dioxide (CO2) conversion into value&#8208;added products, and hydrogen (H2) generation from water (H2O) splitting. Recently, metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have emerged as an important class of semiconductors for heterogeneous photocatalysis owing to their interesting properties. Despite key issues with long&#8208;term stability and degradation in polar solvents due to their ionic character, there has been significant progress in halide perovskite&#8208;based photocatalysts with improving their stability and performance in the gas and liquid phases. This review discusses the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art for using halide perovskite&#8208;based photocatalysts and photoelectrocatalysis in hydrogen production from water and halogen acid solutions, CO2 reduction into value&#8208;added chemicals, and various organic chemical transformations. The different types of halide perovskites used, design strategies to overcome the instability issues in polar solvents, and the efficiencies achieved are discussed. Furthermore, the outstanding challenges associated with the use of polar electrolytes and how the stability and performance can be improved are discussed.

The high&#8208;performance, multi&#8208;structured, and functionalized novel current collectors play a crucial role in advancing batteries with high performance, safety, and intelligence for next&#8208;generation energy storage devices.









Abstract
The rapid advancement of rechargeable batteries is hindered by insufficient energy density, limited design flexibility, and safety concerns, which pose significant challenges to their practical application. This review summarizes the crucial yet often overlooked role of current collectors in addressing these challenges. Recent progress across four types of current collectors, deriving from metal foils, carbonaceous substrates, conductive polymers, and organic&#8211;inorganic hybrids is systematically analyzed. Metal foils, as the most widely used current collectors, now face challenges including corrosion susceptibility and high volumetric density. Carbonaceous and polymer&#8208;based alternatives offer lightweight design and structural flexibility, but face limitations in conductivity and scalable production. Notably, organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid current collectors, leveraging material engineering and hierarchical design, offer a promising avenue to enhance battery safety and intelligence. Further, potential directions for current collector development, emphasizing 1) enhanced battery performance, 2) multiscale structural adaptability, and 3) integrated multifunctional design, providing prospective insights for next&#8208;generation energy storage devices are outlined.

Biomechanical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical energy conversion devices are uniquely suited for self&#8208;driven physiological information monitoring and powering human&#8211;computer interaction systems. These devices based on micro&#8208;/nanoarchitectured inorganic dielectric materials (MNIDMs) have shown ultrahigh electromechanical performance and thus great potential for practical deployment. This review constructs a nexus among MNIDMs and all kinds of biomechanical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical energy conversion nanogenerators in terms of material development.








Abstract
Biomechanical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical energy conversion technology rapidly developed with the emergence of nanogenerators (NGs) in 2006, which proves promising in distributed energy management for the Internet of Things, self&#8208;powered sensing, and human&#8211;computer interaction. Recently, researchers have increasingly integrated inorganic dielectric materials (IDMs) and micro&#8208;/nanoarchitectures into various types of NGs (i.e., triboelectric, piezoelectric, and flexoelectric NGs). This strategy significantly enhances the electrical performance, enabling near&#8208;theoretical energy harvesting capability and precise multiple physiological information detection. However, because micro&#8208;/nanoarchitectured IDMs function differently in each type of NG, numerous studies have focused on a single NG type and lack a unified perspective on their role across all types of biomechanical energy NGs. In this review, from an overall theoretical root of NGs, the performance enhancement mechanisms and effects of designs of IDMs coupling micro&#8208;/nanoarchitectures of various kinds of biomechanical energy NGs are systematically summarized. Next, advanced applications in human energy scavenging and physiological signal sensing are delved into. Finally, challenges and rational guidelines for designing future devices are discussed. This work provides researchers with in&#8208;depth insight into the development of high&#8208;performance personalized high&#8208;entropy power supplies and sensor networks via biomechanical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical energy conversion technologies based on IDMs coupling micro&#8208;/nanoarchitectures.

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution Patterned Delivery of Chemical Signals From 3D&#8208;Printed Picoliter Droplet Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D&#8208;printed picoliter droplet networks have been fabricated that control gene expression in bacterial populations by releasing chemical signals with precise spatial definition and high temporal resolution. This system of effector release is widely applicable, offering diverse applications in biology and medicine.









Abstract
Synthetic cells, such as giant unilamellar vesicles, can be engineered to detect and release chemical signals to control target cell behavior. However, control over the targeting of cell populations is limited due to poor spatial or temporal resolution and the inability of synthetic cells to deliver patterned signals. Here, 3D&#8208;printed picoliter droplet networks are described that direct gene expression in underlying bacterial populations by patterned release of a chemical signal with temporal control. Shrinkage of the droplet networks prior to use achieves spatial control over gene expression with &#8776;50 &#181;m resolution. Ways to store chemical signals in the droplet networks and to activate release at controlled points in time are also demonstrated. Finally, it is shown that the spatially&#8208;controlled delivery system can regulate competition between bacteria by inducing the patterned expression of toxic bacteriocins. This system provides the groundwork for the use of picoliter droplet networks in fundamental biology and in medicine in applications that require the controlled formation of chemical gradients (i.e., for the purpose of local control of gene expression) within a target group of cells.

         <title>A Microgel&#8211;Hydrogel Hybrid for Functional Compensation and Mechanical Stability in 3D Printed Cell&#8208;Dense Vascularized Liver Tissue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterogeneous microgel&#8211;hydrogel hybrid is developed&#160;to construct a multiscale vascular network through embedded bioprinting and guided vascular morphogenesis. With a high density of hepatocytes, a bioengineered thick vascularized liver tissue model achieves a rapid and&#160;promising functional compensation in rats with 85% hepatectomy via direct vascular integration, providing a theraputi paradigm for physiological&#8208;related engineered tissue in animals with acute disease.








Abstract
3D bioprinting of liver tissue with high cell density (HCD) shows great promise for restoring function in cases of acute liver failure, where a substantial number of functional cells are required to perform essential physiological tasks. Direct vascular anastomosis is critical for the successful implantation of these bioprinted vascularized tissues into the host vasculature, allowing for rapid functional compensation and addressing various acute conditions. However, conventional hydrogels used to encapsulate high&#8208;density cells often lack the mechanical properties needed to withstand the shear forces of physiological blood flow, often resulting in implantation failure. In this study, a heterogeneous microgel&#8211;hydrogel hybrid is developed to carry HCD hepatocytes and support the embedded bioprinting of hierarchical vascular structures. By optimizing the ratio of microgel to biomacromolecule, the covalently crosslinked network offers mechanical integrity and enables&#160;direct vascular anastomosis, ensuring efficient nutrient and oxygen exchange. The bioprinted thick, vascularized constructs, containing HCD hepatocytes, are successfully implanted in rats after 85% hepatectomy, leading to swift functional recovery and prolonged survival. This study presents a strategy to enhance regenerative therapy outcomes through advanced bioprinting and vascular integration techniques.

         <title>Cephalopod&#8208;Inspired Magnetic Shape&#8208;Morphing System for Complex 3D Transformations with Broad Reconfigurability in 3D Displays and Soft Robotics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emulating skin&#8208;texturing capabilities of cephalopods, a magnetic shape&#8208;morphing platform (MMP) is developed to enable systems that reversibly modulate their morphology and stiffness. The MMP, consisting of polymer composites embedded with liquid metal droplets and ferromagnetic particles, achieves complex and sophisticated 3D configurations through thermo&#8208;magnetic stimuli under programmed magnetization profiles. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstrations suggest potential applications in 3D displays and soft robotics.








Abstract
Shape&#8208;morphing systems capable of actively achieving diverse three&#8208;dimensional (3D)&#160;configurations are essential for advancements in 3D electronics and soft robotics. However, current shape&#8208;morphing technologies encounter challenges such as iterative shape reconfiguration with high geometrical complexity, mechanical stability, and slow response times. Inspired by the 3D skin texturing abilities of cephalopods, 3D magnetic shape&#8208;morphing systems are introduced, enabling reversible and continuous transformation with a broad range of complex reconfigurable shapes. This is achieved through thermo&#8208;magnetoactive actuation, guided by magnetization profiles created via a 3D magnetic encoding strategy. The system leverages magnetic shape&#8208;morphing platforms (MMPs) built with a composite containing elastomer mixed with low melting point alloy (LMPA) particles comprising ferromagnetic particles. The MMP can produce intricate, robust 3D configurations using multimodal magnetic actuation facilitated by tunable stiffness and magnetoactive reconfigurability. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstrations of 3D visio&#8208;tactile displays and light&#8208;responsive flower robots highlight the potential of bioinspired 3D magnetic shape&#8208;morphing systems, suggesting promising applications in 3D electronics, soft robotics, and visio&#8208;haptic human interfacing.

         <title>Intertwined Topological Phases in TaAs2 Nanowires with Giant Magnetoresistance and Quantum Coherent Surface Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of topological semimetal TaAs2 nanowires in situ encapsulated with a thin SiO2 shell unravel a richness of intertwined topological phases manifested by their magnetotransport features: A near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature metal&#8208;to&#8208;insulator transition, strong expressions of topologically nontrivial surface transport, giant magnetoresistance with direction&#8208;dependent sign reversal, chiral anomaly, and a unique double pattern of Aharonov&#8211;Bohm oscillations.








Abstract
Nanowires (NWs) of topological materials are emerging as an exciting platform to probe and engineer new quantum phenomena that are hard to access in bulk phase. Their quasi&#8208;1D geometry and large surface&#8208;to&#8208;bulk ratio unlock new expressions of topology and highlight surface states. TaAs2, a compensated semimetal, is a topologically rich material harboring nodal&#8208;line, weak topological insulator (WTI), C2&#8208;protected topological crystalline insulator, and Zeeman field&#8208;induced Weyl semimetal phases. We report the synthesis of TaAs2 NWs in situ encapsulated in a dielectric SiO2 shell, which enable to probe rich magnetotransport phenomena, including metal&#8208;to&#8208;insulator transition and strong signatures of topologically nontrivial transport at remarkably high temperatures, direction&#8208;dependent giant positive, and negative magnetoresistance, and a double pattern of Aharonov&#8211;Bohm oscillations, demonstrating coherent surface transport consistent with the two Dirac cones of a WTI surface. The SiO2&#8208;encapsulated TaAs2 NWs show room&#8208;temperature conductivity up to 15 times higher than bulk TaAs2. The coexistence and susceptibility of topological phases to external stimuli have potential applications in spintronics and nanoscale quantum technology.

         <title>Electrochemical Anodization for the Fabrication of Wafer&#8208;Scale p&#8208;Type Organic Permeable Base Transistors Arrays with MHz Operation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a wafer&#8208;scale fabrication method for high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type organic permeable base transistors (OPBTs) using electrochemical anodization. The anodized OPBTs achieve high on&#8208;current density, low leakage, MHz&#8208;range operation, and exceptional current gain. With a 96.3% yield in large&#8208;area arrays, these devices enable scalable organic electronics and advanced complementary circuits, demonstrating potential for future display and logic applications.








Abstract
Organic thin&#8208;film transistors (OTFTs) are promising for flexible, low&#8208;cost, and biocompatible electronics. However, conventional planar OTFTs are hindered by the large channel length limiting the transconductance and switching frequencies. Vertical OTFTs, particularly organic permeable&#8208;base transistors (OPBTs), address these challenges with short channel lengths defined by the layer thickness. While n&#8208;type OPBTs have advanced significantly, p&#8208;type OPBTs face challenges such as lower transmission, higher leakage currents, and unreliable fabrication processes. This work introduces a wafer&#8208;scale method for fabricating p&#8208;type OPBTs using electrochemical anodization of the base electrode. The anodization process applied directly atop the organic semiconductor, preserves electrical properties while suppressing base leakage. The resulting anodized OPBTs exhibit high&#8208;performance characteristics, including an on&#8208;current density of 301 mAcm&#8722;2, low leakage current of 4.32 &#215; 10&#8722;9 A, maximum transmission of 99.9999%, and a maximum current gain of 1.89 &#215; 106&#8212;a 100,000&#8208;fold improvement over prior methods. Small signal analysis reveals a cutoff frequency of 1.49 MHz, with a voltage&#8208;normalized cutoff frequency of 0.54 MHzV&#8722;1. Large&#8208;scale arrays show 96.3% fabrication yield and excellent uniformity. Complementary inverters integrating n&#8208; and p&#8208;type OPBTs exhibit superior switching, highlighting the potential of anodized OPBTs for advanced applications in displays and&#160;circuits.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Polymer Monolayer Transistors with Sub&#8208;20 nm Channel Lengths</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing the body thickness scaling and channel length scaling strategies, polymer monolayer transistors with a channel length of 18 nm are demonstrated, which exhibit good operational stability and reliability with the on&#8208;state current density of 2.4 &#215; 10&#8722;4 A mm&#8722;1 and the intrinsic gate delay of 0.79 ps. Moreover, the short channel effect is investigated by varying the dielectric thickness.








Abstract
The scaling strategy is widely used to achieve much improved performance and reduced cost in a single chip with more devices for field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) based on Si and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 2D materials. However, the downscaling of polymer FETs with high performance has not been achieved. Here both the body thickness scaling and channel length scaling strategies are employed, and demonstrate a 2.4&#8208;nm&#8208;thick polymer monolayer FET, where the shortest channel length (L) of 18&#160;nm is achieved that is comparable to the smallest technology node (&#8776;20&#160;nm) for planar Si FETs. Such short&#8208;channel FETs, with good operational stability and reliability, exhibit only slightly lower field&#8208;effect mobility than the device with micrometer&#8208;long channel, but the on&#8208;state current density reaches 2.4 &#215; 10&#8722;4 A &#181;m&#8722;1. More importantly, a high intrinsic gate delay of 0.79&#160;ps is achieved, while maintaining the on/off current ratio up to 109. Additionally, by increasing the thickness of gate dielectric a remarkable short channel effect is observed, which is in excellent agreement with natural scale length evaluated by the Scale Length Theory.

         <title>In Situ Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation of Peptides Into Droplets Targeting Membraneless Organelles for Enhanced Cancer Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS) of peptides in living cells is developed for enhancing cancer chemotherapy through targeting membraneless organelle stress granules. The peptide underwent sulfatase&#8208;induced phase separation into droplets upon sulfate hydrolysis. Decorated with protein ligands, the in situ&#8208;formed droplets coacervated with stress granules, thereby enhancing cancer chemotherapy with sorafenib via activating caspase&#8208;dependent apoptosis.








Abstract
Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) of proteins and nucleic acids into membraneless organelles (MLOs) plays a critical role in sustaining fundamental physiological processes. However, creating artificial coacervate droplets in living cells from exogenous molecules and modulating the functions of MLOs remain challenging. To address this concern, here we reported enzyme&#8208;induced in situ phase separation of peptides into droplets targeting MLO stress granule (SG) for enhanced cancer chemotherapy. The peptide YSO4F containing two sulfated tyrosine residues undergoes sulfatase&#8208;responsive LLPS into droplets. Cellular studies confirm in situ phase separation of YSO4F selectively in sulfatase&#8208;overexpressing cancer cells. By integrating with appropriate ligands, the in situ&#8208;formed droplets d&#8208;YF&#8208;LSG coacervate with SGs driven by association between the ligand with SG key component protein G3BP2. Mechanistic studies illustrate that the in situ&#8208;formed droplets enhance the cytotoxicity of sorafenib via activating caspase&#8208;dependent apoptosis. Furthermore, animal experiments confirm that administration of the in situ&#8208;formed droplets with sorafenib significantly inhibits tumor growth in murine models bearing tumors, accompanied by an excellent biosafety profile. The findings in this study&#160;elucidate an innovative approach for in situ formulation of coacervate droplets within tumor cells and a new material for targeting membraneless organelles, thus providing a promising new strategy for disease organelle&#8208;targeted therapy in the future.

         <title>Shape Memory Networks With Tunable Self&#8208;Stiffening Kinetics Enabled by Polymer Melting&#8208;Recrystallization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shape recovery of traditional shape memory polymers (SMPs) is often accompanied by a monotonic decrease in mechanical stiffness, thereby impacting their practical applications. Herein, a novel strategy is developed to construct the self&#8208;stiffening SMP triggered by single thermal stimulus by harnessing polymer melting&#8208;recrystallization. Conceptual application of self&#8208;stiffening SMP as a shape memory stent with self&#8208;enhancing supporting function is successfully demonstrated.








Abstract
Shape memory polymers (SMPs) are deformable materials capable of recovering from a programmed temporary shape to a permanent shape under specific stimuli. However, shape recovery of SMPs is often accompanied by the evolution of materials from a stiff to soft state, leading to a significant decrease in strength/modulus and thereby impacting their practical applications. Although some attempts are made to pursue the SMPs with self&#8208;stiffening capability after shape recovery, the modulus increase ratio is much limited. Inspired by the recrystallization process of CaCO3 during crab molting, a novel and universal strategy is developed to construct water&#8208;free self&#8208;stiffening SMPs by using a single thermal stimulus through harnessing the polymer melting&#8208;recrystallization. The shape recovery is achieved through the melting of polymer primary crystals, followed by the self&#8208;stiffening via polymer recrystallization at the same recovery temperature, in which the modulus increase rate and ratio can be programmed in a wide range. Additionally, conceptual applications of these self&#8208;stiffening SMPs as artificial stents with self&#8208;enhancing supporting function are successfully demonstrated. This work is believed to provide new insights for developing the advanced shape memory devices.

         <title>In Situ Real&#8208;Time Quantitative Characterization of Nanofiltration Membrane Pore Orientation for Enhanced Ion Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel in situ real&#8208;time fluorescence technique enables the quantitative monitoring of pore arrangement in nanofiltration membranes and provides design guidance. The membrane is guided to achieve a Mg2+/Li+ separation factor of 15.55 and a permeate flux of 35.85 L m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 bar&#8722;1 through optimization of the membrane structure.








Abstract
Nanofiltration membranes hold great promise for ion separation but often suffer from a trade&#8208;off between selectivity and flux, limiting their use in precise separation processes. A key challenge is achieving precise control over pore orientation, as existing methods fail to provide real&#8208;time, quantitative insights for optimizing membrane structure and performance. To address this, an innovative in situ, real&#8208;time quantitative technique is developed that links pore alignment directly to separation efficiency. Using &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin as a model pore&#8208;forming compound, fluorescent labeling enables continuous monitoring of pore orientation and distribution during membrane fabrication. This method enables the capture of the complete distribution of pore orientation across the entire membrane surface, allowing for precise adjustments in membrane design. This approach provides the real&#8208;time quantification of pore alignment, facilitating the design of NF membranes with enhanced ion selectivity and permeability. The optimized membranes demonstrate exceptional Mg2+/Li+ separation efficiency, with a separation factor of 15.55 and permeance of 35.85 L m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 bar&#8722;1, representing a significant step forward in high&#8208;performance nanofiltration membranes with broad applications in resource recovery, environmental remediation, and water treatment.

         <title>Ultrapure Graphite from Solid Refining</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;purity graphite serves as a fundamental material for scientific research and technological applications. Here, an effective solid refining process is developed utilizing the nickel (Ni) atomic lattice to eliminate both intrinsic and extrinsic impurities, producing ultrapure graphite. The resultant graphite exhibits the highest elemental, structural, and doping purity among all the known natural and artificial graphite, enabling its excellent transport properties.








Abstract
Graphite has sparked extensive quantum physical discoveries and demonstrated numerous cutting&#8208;edge applications. However, existing graphite typically contains considerable impurities, and effective purification is still lacking. Here, a solid refining purification method is reported for obtaining ultrapure graphite. Through this design, impurities are filtered by the atomic lattice of a solid&#8208;state nickel (Ni). Suitable absorption, diffusion, and precipitation energy barriers are utilized in this method, allowing only carbon (C) atoms to effectively migrate through the Ni lattice to form high&#8208;quality graphite. The obtained ultrapure graphite shows the lowest elemental impurity density (&lt;10 parts per million (ppm), which is one order of magnitude lower than that of the best available graphite), the highest structural purity (&lt;0.2 parts per billion (ppb) of in&#8208;plane structural defect density and &gt;99% Bernal stacking), and the highest doping purity (carrier doping density &lt;2.0 &#215; 1010 cm&#8722;2). Such superior purity of graphite facilitates the all&#8208;integer visible Landau levels and the ultralow quantum transition magnetic field in the fabricated graphene device. This solid refinement technique should inspire the purification of various layered crystals, leading to the discovery of new phenomena and the development of advanced applications.

         <title>Interphasial Chemistry Design for Seamless Lithium Deposition in Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces an ultrathin ion&#8208;conducting membrane (ICM) to enhance interfacial stabilization in anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries (AFLMBs). This ICM enhances charge separation, builds stable anion&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interphases (SEI), and inhibits dendritic growth by guiding lithium lateral deposition through ionic nano&#8208;channels. Therefore, this design achieves exceptional Coulombic efficiency (99.82%) in Li||Cu cells and long&#8208;term stability (80.72% capacity retention over 100 cycles) in Li||NCM811 cells, offering a promising path for high&#8208;performance, safe battery systems.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries (AFLMBs) are promising due to ultrahigh energy density, reduced manufacturing costs, and enhanced safety through active lithium elimination. However, their practical implementation remains challenged by unstable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces and the resulting rapid active species depletion. Herein, an ultrathin ion&#8208;conducting membrane (ICM) is designed, featuring uniformly distributed rigid benzenesulfonimide anionic groups and flexible lithiophilic groups containing ether oxygen groups. The constrained benzenesulfonimide anions enable exceptional charge separation and reduced spatial resistance, boosting lithium&#8208;ion mobility, while the integrated lithophilic network directs lateral lithium deposition through ionic nanochannels. This ICM layer effectively promotes the enrichment of anions at the interface and constructs stable anion&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interphases (SEI). Meanwhile, ICM layers with electron&#8208;insulating and ion&#8208;conducting properties can further prevent side reactions, and suppress dendritic Li growth acting as a natural shield, resulting in seamless lithium deposition. Specifically, the Li||Cu coin cells with ICM achieve 99.82% Coulombic efficiency. The AFLMBs assembled with ICM&#8208;coated copper foil (ICM Cu) and NCM811 deliver an energy density of 495&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 with 80.72% capacity retention after 100 cycles. The interphasial chemistry design strategy provides insights into the precise interfacial engineering to realize high&#8208;performance, high&#8208;safety battery systems and facilitates their development for practical applications.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A record spin lifetime of 106 &#181;s at room temperature has been observed in reg&#8208;PAzE with a regular dipole orientation. Integrated theoretical and experimental results reveal that the extended spin lifetime arises from variations in the hyperfine interaction strength induced by intramolecular dipole orientations. The findings will provide valuable insights for designing molecular materials with long spin lifetimes.








Abstract
In spintronics, achieving long spin lifetimes, particularly at room temperature (RT), is a key objective for spin transport materials. Molecular semiconductors (MSCs), with their inherently weak spin relaxation mechanisms, have emerged as promising candidates for realizing long RT spin lifetimes. However, effective strategies to suppress spin relaxation through the design of molecular structures in MSCs are still not well understood, and as a result, spin lifetimes remain limited (&#8776; 10&#8208;&#181;s level at RT). In this study, the impact of intramolecular dipole orientations on spin lifetimes in MSCs has been explored for the first time. Both theoretical and experimental results have demonstrated that dipole orientation influences the hyperfine interaction (HFI) effect (a main causation for spin relaxation), and thus, spin lifetime. By adjusting dipole arrangements through molecular design, it is demonstrated that the poly(2,6&#8208;azuleneethynylene) with a regular dipole orientation served to reduce the HFI strength and ultimately extended the spin lifetime to 106 &#181;s in a spintronic device, much higher than that of the random arrangement, setting a new RT record. This work provides new insights into the spin relaxation mechanism and offers a valuable strategy for extending spin lifetimes in MSCs for future RT spintronic applications.

         <title>Double&#8208;side Interfacial Engineering of Hole Transport Layer Enables Efficient and Operationally Stable Colloidal Quantum Dot Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;side interfacial engineering of the hole transport layer (HTL) is presented for lead sulfide colloidal quantum dot solar cells. This strategy achieves a record efficiency of 14.28% by using classic P3HT as HTL and exhibits exceptional stability with unencapsulated devices retaining 90% initial efficiency for over 520 hours at maximum power point in ambient air, doubling the previous best 260 hours.








Abstract
Although lead sulfide (PbS) colloidal quantum dot (CQD) solar cells demonstrate excellent storage stability under ambient conditions, the operational stability is still rather poor for devices based on both organic or inorganic hole transport layer (HTL), seriously limiting their practical applications. In this work, it is find that both the CQD/polymer HTL bottom interface and the polymer HTL/electrode top interface are critical factors limiting device performance and operational stability. By proposing a double&#8208;side interfacial engineering strategy to achieve surface energy matching and energy level grading, a high efficiency of 14.28% is realized using the classic P3HT HTL material, which is the highest reported efficiency for PbS CQD solar cells with organic HTLs. More importantly, the unencapsulated device can maintain 90% of its initial power (T90) after &#8776;520 hours at the maximum power point (MPP) in ambient air, far exceeding the highest value previously reported in the literature (260 hours). This work provides new insights into the development of stable CQD&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Evolving Structured Liquids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic system mimics essential functions of living cells&#8212;migration, division, and reconfiguration&#8212;by encapsulation of active magnetic particles within a nanoparticle&#8212;surfactant membrane. This membrane preserves its shape after deformations, which can be tuned with surfactant concentrations. The resulting biomimetic, reconfigurable, and responsive material paves the way for autonomous synthetic machines.








Abstract
Migration, division, and reconfiguration &#8211; functions essential to living systems &#8211; are driven by active processes. Developing synthetic mimics is an outstanding challenge. Lipid bilayers that bound natural systems are locally deformed by active species, e.g., microtubules, but the resulting non&#8208;equilibrium shapes relax when active species motion ceases, and the shape changes lack immediate control. A fully synthetic system is described, driven by active particles encapsulated by a reconfigurable nanoparticle&#8208;surfactant membrane that undergoes shape fluctuations reminiscent of living cells. These shape changes are preserved after particle activity stops. Surfactant concentration tunes the interfacial tension over three orders of magnitude, making on&#8208;demand shape evolution possible. Directional migration, division, and reconfiguration across multiple scales are possible, leading to a new class of biomimetic, reconfigurable, and responsive materials, paving the way for autonomous synthetic machines.

         <title>Golden Single&#8208;Atom Alloys Selectively Boosting Oxygen Reduction and Methanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomic design and control of golden single&#8208;atom alloys (PdAu1 and PtAu1 SAAs) are achieved by taking full advantage of the intrinsically isolated Bi atoms in fully ordered PdBi and PtBi matrixes, serving as highly selective, active, and stable cathode oxygen reduction and anode methanol oxidation electrocatalysts, respectively, to trigger a direct methanol fuel cell with high power density.








Abstract
Engineering electrocatalysts at a single&#8208;atomic site can enable unprecedented atomic utilization and catalytic activity, yet it remains challenging in multimetallic active centers to simultaneously achieve high catalytic selectivity and stability. Herein, the atomic design and control of golden single&#8208;atom alloys (PdAu1 and PtAu1 SAAs) based on fully ordered PdBi and PtBi matrixes is presented, serving as highly selective, active, and stable cathode and anode electrocatalysts, respectively, to trigger direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC). The octahedral PdAu1 SAA exhibits ultrahigh mass&#8208;activity of 5.37 A mgPd + Au&#8722;1 without noticeable decay for 12&#160;0000 cycles toward oxygen reduction. While PdAu1 SAA is inactive for methanol oxidation, PtAu1 SAA exhibits an ultrahigh mass&#8208;activity of 28.59 A mgPt + Au&#8722;1. The selective electrocatalysts drive a practical DMFC with a high&#8208;power density of 155.0&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. Density functional theory calculations reveal the desired regulation of selectivity via reducing the energy barrier for potential&#8208;determining steps (PDS) of *OH to H2O and *HCOO to CO2. This work provides a general strategy to engineer multimetallic alloys at the atomic level, advancing the development of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts.

         <title>Phagocytosis&#8208;Activating Nanocomplex Orchestrates Macrophage&#8208;Mediated Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pro&#8208;phagocytic polymer&#8208;based nanocomplex, MNCCD47i&#8208;CALRt, is designed to enhance macrophage&#8208;mediated tumor cell engulfment by modulating both the pro&#8208; and anti&#8208;phagocytic signals. Comprising a PAMAM derivative to induce calreticulin exposure and an RNAi to inhibit CD47 expression, MNCCD47i&#8208;CALRt effectively delays tumor growth and prolongs survival in mice, offering a potent strategy to potentiate macrophage&#8208;mediated cancer immunotherapy.









Abstract
The phagocytosis of macrophages to tumor cells represents an alluring strategy for cancer immunotherapy; however, its effectiveness is largely hindered by the detrimental upregulation of anti&#8208;phagocytic signals and insufficient expression of pro&#8208;phagocytic signals of tumor cells. Here, a pro&#8208;phagocytic polymer&#8208;based nanocomplex is designed to promote the macrophage engulfment of tumor cells through concurrent modulation of both the &#8220;eat me&#8221; and &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signals. The nanocomplex MNCCD47i&#8208;CALRt is formed by complexing a synthetic PAMAM derivative (G4P&#8211;C7A) that is capable of intrinsically inducing the exposure of calreticulin (CALR, a crucial pro&#8208;phagocytic protein) and a small inference RNA that can inhibit the expression of CD47 (a primary anti&#8208;phagocytic protein). MNCCD47i&#8208;CALRt can significantly delay tumor growth and prolong the survival of tumor&#8208;bearing mice with negligible hematopoietic toxicity in multiple murine colorectal cancer models. Furthermore, the pro&#8208;phagocytic capacity of MNCCD47i&#8208;CALRt is validated in the patient&#8208;derived tumor organoid model. Collectively, the phagocytosis&#8208;promoting nanocomplex provides a simple and potent strategy for boosting macrophage&#8208;mediated cancer immunotherapy.

Here, a pro-phagocytic polymer-based nanocomplex is designed to promote the macrophage engulfment of tumor cells through concurrent modulation of both the &#8220;eat me&#8221; and &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signals. The nanocomplex MNC&lt;sub&gt;CD47i-CALRt&lt;/sub&gt; is formed by complexing a synthetic PAMAM derivative (G4P&#8211;C7A) that is capable of intrinsically inducing the exposure of calreticulin (CALR, a crucial pro-phagocytic protein) and a small inference RNA that can inhibit the expression of CD47 (a primary anti-phagocytic protein). MNC&lt;sub&gt;CD47i-CALRt&lt;/sub&gt; can significantly delay tumor growth and prolong the survival of tumor-bearing mice with negligible hematopoietic toxicity in multiple murine colorectal cancer models. Furthermore, the pro-phagocytic capacity of MNC&lt;sub&gt;CD47i-CALRt&lt;/sub&gt; is validated in the patient-derived tumor organoid model. Collectively, the phagocytosis-promoting nanocomplex provides a simple and potent strategy for boosting macrophage-mediated cancer immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anion&#8208;Cation Synergistic Regulation of Low&#8208;Dimensional Perovskite Passivation Layer for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sulfur&#8208;hybridized aniline&#8208;like molecule thiomorpholine (SMOR) forms n = 1 2D perovskite and is preferred to transfer into 1D perovskite instead of high n&#8208;valued 2D perovskite after aging. Due to larger formation energy, chlorine anion is better than iodine anion to accelerate the formation of 1D phase. The PCE of the SMOR&#8208;based 1D/3D perovskite passivated device reaches 25.5% and shows T90 lifetime over 1000 h at 85&#176;C without encapsulation.









Abstract
Mixing 2D and 3D perovskite together is an effective strategy to enhance the stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). This strategy has been widely used in many recent works. Typically, 2D layer is formed by introducing 2D spacer onto 3D surfaces through in situ intercalation reaction. However, this intercalation may not stop after the 2D layer is formed. Progressive migration of 2D spacer into 3D bulk leads to increased n&#8208;values of 2D phases and deviation from optimized structural design. The high n&#8208;value 2D perovskite is less stable than the low n&#8208;value 2D perovskite and may be prone to degradation under external stresses. Here, a heteroatom ammonium ligand, thiomorpholine (SMOR) is found, which can effectively passivate the perovskite surface, and form a 1D phase or 2D phase depending on cation to anion ratio and the type of anions. Due to lower formation energy at 1:1 cation to anion ratio, 1D phase can prevent the formation of high&#8208;n&#8208;value 2D phase and show excellent thermal stability. The passivation of SMOR&#8208;based 1D perovskite boosts the device efficiency to 25.6% (certified 24.7%). More importantly, the unpackaged device can maintain &gt;80% of its initial efficiency after stable operation at 85 &#176;C for 1000 h.

         <title>Developing Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Ether&#8208;Based Electrolytes with Trifluorotoluylation Ionic Liquids for High Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes molecular design strategies to develop trifluorotoluylation ILs that enable quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state ether&#8208;based electrolytes for high&#8208;voltage LMBs. The designed ILs greatly enhance the oxidative stability of the electrolyte and effectively suppress the dissolution of transition metal ions, facilitating the formation of a LiF&#8208;rich interfacial layer on the lithium anode, promoting uniform distribution of Li+ and regular deposition of lithium.








Abstract
The practical application of quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state ether&#8208;based electrolytes is hindered by lithium dendrite formation and poor oxidation stability, which reduce the cycle life and energy density of the battery. Here, taking advantage of the ionic liquids&#8217; high ionic interactions and structural flexibility in forming an optimized electrode/electrolyte interface, a pyrrolidinium&#8208;based ionic liquids with trifluorotoluylation cationic segment is designed and developed. The oxidation of anions in the electrolytes is induced to form a robust inorganic LiF&#8208;rich interphase at the cathode, thereby effectively achieving high oxidation stability and suppressing the dissolution of transition metal ions. In addition, the LiF interphases derived from the trifluorotoluylation cations increase the modulus of the anode interface and suppress the growth of lithium dendrites. Therefore, the Li&#8208;LiFePO4, Li&#8208;LiCoO2, and Li&#8208;LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 full cells with the optimized electrolytes demonstrate remarkable performance improvements at high current density (10 C), a wide voltage range of 4.5&#160;V, a high mass loading of 11.1&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, and a wide temperature range of &#8722;20&#8211;80&#160;&#176;C. Furthermore, a 2.66 Ah&#8208;level pouch cell with a high&#8208;energy&#8208;density of exceeding 356&#160;Wh kg&#8210;1 and excellent cyclic stability demonstrates the potential of the strategy in providing a path for the practical application of quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state ether&#8208;based electrolytes in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.

         <title>Glow&#8208;Worm&#8208;Inspired Fluorescent Self&#8208;Healing Actuators for Soft Robot and Reconfigurable Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by glow&#8208;worms, a high&#8208;performance multifunctional fluorescent actuator is fabricated by combining ultra&#8208;stable perovskite quantum dots with self&#8208;healing materials. It integrates large deformation, high brightness, high color&#8208;purity, color&#8208;changing function and full&#8208;device self&#8208;healing function together. The full&#8208;device self&#8208;healing function enables reconfigurable on&#8208;demand fluorescent patterns. This actuator opens new paths to soft robots and reconfigurable information encryption.








Abstract
Fluorescent actuators with light&#8208;emitting and shape&#8208;deformation properties are promising in bionics and soft robotics. However, current fluorescent actuators barely balance actuation performances with fluorescence properties, as they exhibit insufficient brightness, poor color&#8208;purity, low&#8208;stability, and few functional&#8208;integrations, limiting their applications in complex scenarios. Herein, inspired by glow&#8208;worms, a multifunctional fluorescent actuator by combining ultra&#8208;stable perovskite quantum dots with polyurethane and graphene oxide composites is reported, which integrates large deformation, high brightness, high color&#8208;purity, color&#8208;changing function and full&#8208;device self&#8208;healing function together. The actuator shows a large bending curvature of 2.48&#160;cm&#8722;1. It exhibits excellent fluorescence performances, such as quantum yields as high as 58.88% and full&#8208;widths at half&#8208;maximum as narrow as 21&#160;nm. The actuation and fluorescence properties show long&#8208;term stability during more than 1100 cycles of near&#8208;infrared irradiation and 12&#160;h of ultraviolet exposure. Moreover, the actuator is integrated with color&#8208;changing and full&#8208;device self&#8208;healing functions, enabling a synergetic color/shape change and reconfigurable on&#8208;demand fluorescent patterns. Then, a smart gripper and a crawling robot with crawling/rollover motions are demonstrated. Finally, a non&#8208;contact dynamic display of reconfigurable encrypted information driven by light is fabricated to mimic light communications of glow&#8208;worms. This actuator demonstrates unprecedented multifunctionality, opening new avenues for fluorescent soft robotics.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Autocatalyzed Synthesis of Multi&#8208;Element Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a simple and controllable gold&#8208;autocatalyzed synthesis method to incorporate multiple metal elements into a single&#8208;phase multi&#8208;element nanoparticle regardless of its immiscibility at room temperature. This reaction occurs among molecules and can be predicted according to frontier molecular orbital theory.








Abstract
The incorporation of multiple metal elements into a nanoparticle without phase separation holds promise for versatile applications, yet a facile synthetic strategy is lacking. Herein, a simple and facile approach is presented, i.e., gold&#8208;autocatalyzed synthesis, in which multiple miscible or immiscible metal elements are incorporated into single&#8208;phase nanoparticles at atmospheric pressure and temperature. This study reveals the autocatalytic reduction behavior of gold and the corresponding growth process of multi&#8208;element alloy nanoparticles. The mechanism of autocatalytic synthetic reactions is revealed on the basis of molecular orbitals. Furthermore, quinary multi&#8208;element nanoparticles were prepared and applied as high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline electrolytes (with overpotentials of 24 and 42&#160;mV to deliver 10 and 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively) to demonstrate the application of this strategy. This strategy enables the synthesis of multi&#8208;element materials with high tolerance of synthetic conditions for versatile applications.

This study reveals the autocatalytic reduction behavior of gold and the corresponding growth process of multi-element alloy nanoparticles. The mechanism of autocatalytic synthetic reactions is revealed on the basis of molecular orbitals. Furthermore, quinary multi-element nanoparticles were prepared and applied as high-performance electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline electrolytes (with overpotentials of 24 and 42&#160;mV to deliver 10 and 100&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively) to demonstrate the application of this strategy. This strategy enables the synthesis of multi-element materials with high tolerance of synthetic conditions for versatile applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Scale Hydration&#8208;Induced Electrical and Mechanical Torsional Energy Harvesting in Heterophilically Designed CNT Yarns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the abundance and vast energy potential of water, its efficient utilization is hindered by single&#8208;mode energy conversion. Herein, heterophilic CNT yarns that allow for simultaneous energy harvesting by means of dual&#8208;scale hydration&#8212;electrical energy harvesting through proton gradients and mechanical torsional harvesting through microchannel absorption are presented.








Abstract
Water holds vast potential for a useful energy source, yet traditional approaches capture only a fraction of it. This study introduces a heterophilically designed carbon nanotube (CNT) yarn with an asymmetric configuration. This yarn is capable of both electrical and mechanical torsional energy harvesting through dual&#8208;scale hydration. Fabricated via half&#8208;electrochemical oxidation, the yarn contains a hydrophilic region enriched with oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups and a hydrophobic pristine CNT region. Molecular&#8208;scale hydration triggers proton release in the hydrophilic region. Consequently, a concentration gradient is established that generates a peak open&#8208;circuit voltage of 106.0&#160;mV and a short&#8208;circuit current of 20.6&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Simultaneously, microscale hydration induces water absorption into inter&#8208;bundle microchannels, resulting in considerable yarn volume expansion. This process leads to hydro&#8208;driven actuation with a torsional stroke of 78.8&#176;&#160;mm&#8722;1 and a maximum rotational speed of 1012 RPM. The presented simultaneous harvesting results in electrical and mechanical power densities of 3.5&#160;mW&#160;m&#8722;2 and 34.3&#160;W&#160;kg&#8722;1, respectively, during a hydration cycle. By integrating molecular and microscale hydrations, the proposed heterophilic CNT yarns establish an unprecedented platform for simultaneous electrical and mechanical energy harvesting from water, representing a groundbreaking development&#160;for sustainable applications.

         <title>Zwitterionic Brush&#8208;Grafted Interfacial Bio&#8208;Lubricant Evades Complement C3&#8208;Mediated Macrophage Phagocytosis for Osteoarthritis Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A macrophage&#8208;evading nano&#8208;lubricant is designed to enhance osteoarthritis (OA) treatment by suppressing complement C3 adsorption and subsequent macrophage phagocytosis. Through a zwitterionic PMPC brush layer, this strategy reduces inflammation, preserves joint lubrication, and prevents OA progression. This work highlights the pivotal role of complement C3 in nanoparticle clearance and offers a novel therapeutic approach for OA management.









Abstract
Administering a bio&#8208;lubricant is a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA), in particular, if it can both manage symptoms and halt disease progression. However, the clearance of these bio&#8208;lubricants mediated by synovial macrophages leads to reduced therapeutic efficiency and adverse inflammatory responses. Herein, it is shown that this process is predominantly mediated by the specific binding of complement C3 (on nanoparticle) and CD11b (on macrophage). More importantly, through a systematic evaluation of various interface modifications, a macrophage&#8208;evading nanoparticle strategy is proposed, which not only minimizes friction, but also largely suppresses C3 adsorption. It involves employing a zwitterionic poly&#8208;2&#8208;methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (PMPC) brush layer grafted from a crosslinked gelatin core. In vitro studies demonstrate that such a nanoparticle lubricant can evade macrophage phagocytosis and further prevent the pro&#8208;inflammatory M1 polarization and subsequent harmful release of cytokines. In vivo studies show that the designed PMPC brush layer effectively mitigates synovial inflammation, alleviates OA&#8208;associated pain, and protects cartilage from degeneration, thus preventing OA progression. These findings clarify the pivotal role of complement C3&#8208;mediated macrophage recognition in nanoparticles clearance and offer a promising nanoparticle design strategy to restore joint lubrication.

         <title>Biomimetic Gradual Helical Structure for Enhancing the Strength and Toughness of Fiber&#8208;Reinforced Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving synergistic strengthening and toughening of natural fiber&#8208;reinforced composites remains a significant challenge. Drawing inspiration from multi&#8208;layer helical structures observed in natural organisms, a green, facile, and versatile transitional unit design strategy is designed to construct a gradual helical structure. This approach helps successfully achieve simultaneous strengthening and toughening of natural fiber&#8208;reinforced composites.








Abstract
Multilayered helical arrangements are commonly observed in natural creatures to enhance their strength and toughness. A biomimicry of such an intricate structure has thus far been challenging. Herein, a green, facile, and versatile design strategy is proposed for transitional units. The proposed strategy is applied to develop a gradual helical (GH) structure that can reinforce thermoplastics using bamboo fibers (&#8776;20&#160;cm). A transitional unit is constructed through a combination of rolling and twisting. Following hot pressing, a biomimetic fiber&#8208;reinforced composite with a GH structure is fabricated. The GH structure is made up of 3D helical fibers with a gradual variation in the helical angle from the surface to the core, achieving minimal staggered angles and bridging of different fiber layers. Owing to stress decomposition and transfer as well as the coupling effect of the helical fibers, the GH structure exhibits outstanding tensile and bending strengths. Moreover, owing to the staggered arrangement, bridging, and deformation behavior of the fibers, the GH structure achieves remarkable impact toughness through crack deflection and fiber uncoiling. The GH structure and transitional unit assembly strategy can facilitate the development of advanced composites with superior mechanical properties through an environmentally friendly, simple, and versatile structural design approach.

         <title>Processable and Recyclable Covalent Organic Framework Gel Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation of COF gels is demonstrated and presents a method for solution&#8208;based reconstruction of COF gel electrolytes, inspired by the operational principle of wedges. By introducing oxygen atoms into the framework, the interaction forces are modulated between the framework layers and introduce active sites for trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). This approach enables the exfoliation of COF layers, allowing them to be effectively dispersed as a nanosheet in an aqueous&#8208;TFA solution. Furthermore, by taking advantage of the dynamic nature of imine bond and controlling the ratio of TFA to water, this manages the competitive interactions between TFA, COF, and water molecules, enabling the reconfiguration of COF materials from nanosheet dispersions back to gels. The obtained gel material demonstrated exceptional cycling stability, and sustaining performance.








Abstract
Covalent organic framework (COF)&#8208;based electrolytes with abundant ordered channels and accessible interaction sites have shown great potential in energy storage and transformation, although their practical applications are strongly impeded by their inherent insolubility and non&#8208;melt processability. Developing processable COF gel electrolytes and recycling them remains a formidable challenge. In this study, the processing of COF to gels demonstrated through interlayer interaction manipulation and enable solution&#8208;reconstruction of COF gel electrolytes for the first time, inspired by the working principle of wedges. Good solution&#8208;processability of the COF powders in strong acid mediums is achieved by inserting oxygen atoms into its framework to promote the interlayer charge repulsion. This modification enabled the COF readily dispersable as colloidal nanosheets in an aqueous solution of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Starting from here, this is modulated competitive interactions among TFA, COF, and water molecules, to reconfigure COF materials between their gelified and colloidally dispersed states. The reconfigured COF gel maintains their mechanical properties and long cycle life as an electrolyte in the battery (&gt;800&#160;h). This approach realizes solution processing of COF powders and can recycle COF out of gels for repeated use, offering new insights and strategies for their preparation and sustainable recycling.

         <title>Graphene&#8208;skinned Alumina fiber Fabric for Diverse Electrothermal and Electromagnetic Compatibility and Its Mass Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene&#8208;skinned alumina fiber fabric (GAFF) with widely tunable electrical and electromagnetic properties is developed by graphene chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on each fiber in alumina fiber fabric (AFF). GAFF offers broad tunability in sheet resistance, electrothermal capability, as well as electromagnetic reflectivity and transmissivity. GAFF with widely tunable multifunction promises significant advancements in diverse applications in modern electronics and instrumentation.








Abstract
As electronics and instrumentation grow increasingly complex, multifunctional materials are essential for simplifying designs. Electrothermal and electromagnetic functions are commonly used, typically supplied by separate materials. Integrating them into a single material can reduce components and miniaturize systems. Meanwhile, materials with widely tunable electrical and electromagnetic properties are needed to meet diverse application requirements, from electromagnetic waves transmitting to shielding, and electric heating across a wide temperature range. Graphene&#8208;skinned alumina fiber fabric (GAFF) with widely tunable electrical and electromagnetic properties is developed by graphene chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on each fiber in alumina fiber fabric (AFF). GAFF offers broad tunability in sheet resistance (1&#8211;10&#160;000 &#937;&#183;sq&#8722;1), electrothermal capability (up to &#8776;1400&#160;&#176;C), as well as electromagnetic reflectivity (&#8776;0.003 to &#8776;0.91) and transmissivity (&#8776;0.98 to &#8776;0.0001) by adjusting graphene thickness and AFF pore size. Mass production of GAFFs in various specifications is realized, enabling diverse applications. Heating&#8208;shielding&#8208;integrated device (GAFF&#8208;HS) featuring high electromagnetic reflectivity and low transmissivity, and heating&#8208;transmitting&#8208;compatible device (GAFF&#8208;HT) with low electromagnetic reflectivity and high transmissivity, are both fabricated to target distinct applications: electrothermal anti&#8208;/de&#8208;icing for electromagnetic interference shielding systems and radar systems, respectively. GAFF with widely tunable multifunction promises significant advancements in diverse applications in modern electronics and instrumentation.

         <title>Superwetting&#8208;Enabled In Situ Silicification for Artificial Silicified Wood</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superwetting&#8208;enabled in situ silicification strategy is proposed to fabricate artificial silicified wood without high pressure and high temperature. The artificial silicified wood exhibits super flexural strength (&#8776;216.49 MPa) and resistance to termites (98.70% mass retention) and fungi (over 90.64% mass retention), meeting the highest AWPA and ASTM standards. This method offers a promising approach to the conservation of wooden artifacts.








Abstract
Wooden artifacts have attracted comprehensive concern as the witnesses of human civilization; however, their conservation suffers from many difficulties, such as natural degradation and biological invasion. Silicified wood, as a fossil material that has existed for millions of years, provides a valuable clue for the long&#8208;term conservation of wooden materials. In this work, a superwetting&#8208;enabled in situ silicification strategy is reported to silicify wood in a confined way, fabricating artificial silicified wood within 100 h. The superwetting process of the silica sol enables multi&#8208;scale high silica filling throughout the entire wood from the nanoscale to the macroscale. The artificial silicified wood shows a high flexural strength of &#8776;216.49&#160;MPa and super resistance against termites and fungi. The artificial silicified wood retains 98.70% of its mass against termites, and over 90.64% of its mass against fungi, meeting the safest level in the global standards. The finding provides a general silicification approach for wood&#8208;like materials with complex hierarchical structures and a promisingly alternative solution for the conservation of wooden artifacts.

         <title>Lowering Toxicity of Solvent in Organic Solar Cells Manufacturing for 20% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acute toxicological properties of the solvents commonly used in the organic photovoltaic (OPV) are evaluated. The preparation technology of devices and micro&#8208;modules by developing solvent processing methods are committed to optimizing with low ecological impact. Finally, an optimized solvent formulation of TCE:OXY blend is arrived to yield a module efficiency of 17.6% with area of 18.4 cm2.








Abstract
Thin film organic photovoltaics (OPVs) aim to harness solar energy environmentally friendly, highly efficient, and cost&#8208;effective means, thereby offering a sustainable solution for energy production and ecological preservation. Efforts are undertook to optimize engineering preparation technology for OPV devices and mini&#8208;modules, through the development of low&#8208;ecological&#8208;impact solvent processing method. A newly developed solvent engineering strategy employing environmentally benign o&#8208;xylene (OXY) with synergistic dual additives (DIM and DIB) achieved an optimal power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.0% (JSC of 26.6 mA cm&#8722;2, VOC of 0.935 V, FF of 80.3%) alongside exceptional stability metrics (82%&#8211;1500h). The mini&#8208;module processed with optimized TCE:OXY (1:3 v/v) solvent demonstrated scalable performance reaching 17.6% (18.4 cm2), representing the highest performance achieved in the development safe solvent based OPVs. Suitable microscale patterns contributed to a broader range of receiving angles, enabling more flexible installation geometries for building&#8208;integrated applications.

         <title>Photoinduced, Swift, and Reversible Spatiotemporal Programming of Double Dynamically Bonded Liquid Crystal Elastomer Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating anthracene&#8208;based dynamic bonds into a supramolecular liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) enables swift and reversible alternation of its local nematic&#8208;isotropic transition temperature and global actuation strain. The morphing behavior of the LCE actuator can be spatiotemporally programmed by varying the local UV exposure. This empowers precise motion control to accomplish intricate tasks, such as the aligning, threading, and locking mechanism.








Abstract
Spatiotemporal programming of the morphing behavior of liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) by local tailoring of the nematic to isotropic temperature (TNI) can empower the precise design of their versatile motions. The current approach and materials design to achieve this process are either slow or irreversible, limiting its efficiency and efficacy. Here, a dynamic bond of anthracene and ethyl acrylate (An&#8208;A) is introduced to enable photoinduced topology transformation to alter the TNI of the LCE, into a hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular LCE network, where the actuation modes can already be reconfigured upon annealing. Experiments and molecular dynamics simulation demonstrate that the An&#8208;A bonds undergo reversible cycloaddition with 365&#160;nm UV exposure for as short as 10&#160;min, and depolymerization with 254&#160;nm UV. The resulting topological transformations of the network give rise to changes in the TNI, actuation strain, and mechanical properties, which can be programed and erased by light. With that, a spatiotemporally reprogrammable LCE actuator: a single LCE that morphs into different shapes, especially those that are far more achievable when the trajectory can be designed by sequential actuation, is developed. This system offers a promising strategy for swift and reversible morphing behavior with custom&#8208;designed trajectory in future smart soft robots.

The design of physical adsorbents for a precise recognition of gas molecules with similar kinetic sizes is of importance as adsorptive separation can serve as an alternative to energy&#8208;intensive distillation processes. However, it is challenging to balance the selectivity, capacity, and adsorption kinetics of the adsorbents. Herein, an efficient kinetic separation of acetylene and carbon dioxide is reported, which have nearly identical kinetic sizes, achieved through modification of the one&#8208;dimensional (1D) channels of a micrometer&#8208;sized mordenite. Under ambient conditions, the weak acid salt&#8208;modified mordenite denoted as NaAlO2@MOR(0.5), exhibits a remarkable kinetic separation selectivity of 534.3 while retaining an excellent diffusivity for CO2. Compared to other adsorbent materials, its dynamic column performance for carbon dioxide significantly exceeds those of molecular sieve materials. In terms of separation selectivity, it is superior to thermodynamic separation adsorbents. The high efficiency of NaAlO2@MOR(0.5) in CO2/C2H2 kinetic separation is validated by column breakthrough experiments. Furthermore, NaAlO2@MOR(0.5) has a low cost and high thermal stability. This study can guide the design of adsorbents that balance selectivity, capacity, and gas diffusivity, to provide a highly efficient kinetic separation of gas molecules with similar kinetic diameters.

         <title>Parallel Regulation of Charge Dynamics on Bipolar Ferroelectric Surfaces Breaks the Limits for Water Splitting Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, by synergistically modulating carrier dynamics, both the separation efficiency and the quantity of electrons and holes transferred to ferroelectrics are optimized in parallel. As a result, the highest apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 5.78% at 365 nm for overall water splitting among ferroelectric materials is achieved and reported to date.








Abstract
Ferroelectric materials, known for their non&#8208;inversion symmetry, show promise as photocatalysts due to their unique asymmetric charge separation, which separates hydrogen and oxygen evolution sites. However, the strong depolarized field induces a relaxed surface structure, which in turn directly leads to slow hole charge transfer dynamics, hindering their efficiency in water splitting. In this study, a fundamental breakthrough in dramatically enhancing the overall water&#8208;splitting activity is presented, through the synergistically regulating of the surface behaviors of photogenerated carriers,&#160;resulting in nearly perfect parallel dynamics and balanced amounts. By depositing atomic layers of TiO2 onto the surface of PbTiO3, surface vacancies are effectively passivated, significantly prolonging the hole lifetime from 10&#8722;6 to 10&#8722;3 s. Spatially resolved transient photovoltage spectroscopy showed that improved hole dynamics led to a 180&#176; phase shift between photogenerated electrons and holes, indicating nearly identical extraction dynamics. Notably, hole and electron concentrations increased to equivalent levels. This leads to a nearly 578&#8208;fold increment in the apparent quantum yield, resulting in significantly increased overall water&#8208;splitting rates, with a quantum yield of 5.78% at 365&#160;nm. The strategy is also effective with Al2O3 and SiO2, demonstrating its versatility across varied materials, providing&#160;a valuable method for creating high&#8208;performance ferroelectric photocatalysts.

         <title>In Situ Formation of a Bi/Mg&#8208;Based Hybrid Interphase for Highly Reversible Magnesium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Bi/Mg&#8208;based hybrid interphase protective layer is formed on the Mg foil via an in situ quasi&#8208;solid&#8722;solid redox reaction. Magnesiophilic components enhance Mg ion transfer, desolvation, and nucleation kinetics, whereas magnesiophobic species confer passivation&#8208;free and corrosion&#8208;resistant properties. Consequently, the smooth anode&#8208;electrolyte interphase facilitates homogeneous charge/ion distribution, promoting a highly reversible Mg plating/stripping process.








Abstract
Magnesium (Mg) is a promising anode material for magnesium metal batteries (MMBs) owing to its high specific capacity, excellent safety profile, and abundant availability. However, pristine Mg anodes suffer from uneven plating/stripping and surface passivation/corrosion, limiting the safety and cycling stability of MMBs. This study introduces a Bi/Mg&#8208;based hybrid interphase protective layer on Mg foil (denoted Bi&#8208;Mg@Mg) through an in situ quasi&#8208;solid&#8211;solid redox reaction by immersing the foil in a bismuth oxybromide suspension. The resulting interphase layer consists of magnesiophilic components (Bi metal and Bi2Mg3 alloy) and magnesiophobic species (MgO, MgBr2, and BiBr3). These components synergistically enhance the desolvation, nucleation, and deposition kinetics, mitigate side reactions, and promote uniform electric field and ion flux distributions. As a result, the Bi&#8208;Mg@Mg electrodes exhibit superior Mg plating/stripping reversibility, maintaining stable performance for over 4100&#160;h in the all&#8208;phenyl complex electrolyte and 2900&#160;h in the Mg(TFSI)2 electrolyte, significantly outperforming pristine Mg electrodes. Furthermore, full cells paired with Mo6S8 and S cathodes demonstrate excellent capacities, rate capabilities, and long lifespans, highlighting the exceptional electrochemical performance of the Bi&#8208;Mg@Mg anode. This study offers a promising strategy for developing highly reversible Mg anodes, paving the way for practical long&#8208;cycle MMBs.

         <title>Bioinspired O2&#8208;Evolution Catalysts with Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer Pathway for Portable Oxygen Generation</title>

         <dc:description>
Bioinspired Ru&#8208;doped metal hydroxide (Ru&#8208;Co(OH)x) is developed as an O2&#8208;evolution catalyst with proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) pathway for efficient and low&#8208;energy O2 generation. The lattice H species in Ru&#8208;Co(OH)x optimizes Ru&#8208;oxygen intermediates interactions, thereby enhancing O2 production performance. This technique ensures an uninterrupted O2 supply during emergencies and in regions with limited O2 availability, providing significant societal benefits.









Abstract
Producing high&#8208;purity oxygen (O2) has a wide range of applications across diverse sectors, such as medicine, tunnel construction, the chemical industry, and fermentation. However, current O2 production methods are burdened by complexity, heavy equipment, high energy consumption, and limited adaptability to harsh environments. Here, to address this grand challenge, the de novo design of Ru&#8208;doped metal hydroxide is proposed to serve as bioinspired O2&#8208;evolution catalysts with proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) pathway for low&#8208;energy, environmentally friendly, cost&#8208;effective, and portable O2 generation. The comprehensive studies confirm that the lattice H species in Ru&#8208;Co(OH)x&#8208;based O2&#8208;evolution catalyst can trigger a PCET pathway to optimize Ru&#8208;oxygen intermediates interactions, thus ultimately reducing reaction energy barriers and improving the activities and durabilities. Consequently, the prepared Ru&#8208;Co(OH)x&#8208;loaded membrane catalysts exhibit rapid and long&#8208;term stable O2 production capabilities. Furthermore, the proposed material design strategy of lattice H&#8208;species shows remarkable universality and adaptability to broad Ru&#8208;doped metal hydroxides. This efficient, portable, and cost&#8208;effective O2 generation technique is suggested to ensure an uninterrupted O2 supply during emergencies and in regions with limited O2 availability or air pollution, thus offering significant societal benefits in broad applications.

         <dc:description>
The precise synthesis of 1D materials has enabled the discovery of physical properties only accessible in length scales close to the atomic scale. Herein, it is demonstrated that encapsulation within single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes with matching diameters leads to a stoichiometric quasi&#8208;1D van der Waals polymorph of a 2D pnictogen chalcogenide, Sb2Te3, with a blue&#8208;shifted band gap in the short&#8208;wave infrared regime.








Abstract
The discovery and synthesis of atomically precise low&#8208;dimensional inorganic materials have led to numerous unusual structural motifs and nascent physical properties. However, access to low&#8208;dimensional van der Waals (vdW)&#8208;bound analogs of bulk crystals is often limited by chemical considerations arising from structural factors like atomic radii, bonding or coordination, and electronegativity. Using single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) as confinement templates, we demonstrate the synthesis of a short&#8208;wave infrared&#8208;absorbing quasi&#8208;1D (q&#8208;1D) chain polymorph of Sb2Te3 ([Sb4Te6]n) that is structurally and electronically distinct from its 2D counterpart. It is found that the q&#8208;1D chain polymorph has both three&#8208; and five&#8208;coordinate Sb atoms covalently bonded to Te and is thermodynamically stabilized by the electrostatic interaction between the encapsulated chain and the model SWCNT. The complementary experimental and computational results demonstrate the synthetic advantage of vdW nanotube confinement in the discovery of low&#8208;dimensional polytypes with drastically altered physical properties and potential applications in energy conversion processes.

&lt;p&gt;The precise synthesis of 1D materials has enabled the discovery of physical properties only accessible in length scales close to the atomic scale. Herein, it is demonstrated that encapsulation within single-walled carbon nanotubes with matching diameters leads to a stoichiometric quasi-1D van der Waals polymorph of a 2D pnictogen chalcogenide, Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, with a blue-shifted band gap in the short-wave infrared regime.

         <title>Mechanophysical Synthesis of Core/Shell Hybrid Supraparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Collision&#8208;driven mechanophysical synthesis enables rapid, chemical&#8208;free assembly of core/shell hybrid supraparticles (HSPs) by embedding inorganic nanomaterials onto polymer microparticles. Governed by collision and interfacial energies, this scalable, solvent&#8208;free method accommodates diverse material combinations, allowing multifunctional HSPs for pollutant removal with easy recovery and reuse&#8211;offering a sustainable alternative to conventional surface modification techniques, which often require excessive chemicals and multi&#8208;step processes.








Abstract
Surface modification of polymer microparticles (MPs) is often essential to impart functionalities beyond their inherent properties. However, decorating these surfaces typically requires complex, multi&#8208;step wet chemistry processes to direct assembly and bonding between surfaces, which are not only challenging to control and scale up but also pose significant environmental concerns. Inspired by asteroid impact events, assembly of core/shell hybrid supraparticles (HSPs) is demonstrated via collision&#8208;driven, one&#8208;step dry mixing of inorganic nanoparticles (NPs)&#160;and polymer MPs with a significant contrast in elastic moduli&#8212; a process termed &#8220;mechanophysical synthesis.&#8221; Through the interplay of interfacial energy and collision energy, NPs are stably embedded onto the MP surface. The degree of surface coverage depends on mixing velocity and duration, aligning with results from particle collision simulations. HSPs can be created from a diverse combination of MPs and NPs, regardless of their shapes or chemistry. Furthermore, different types of functional NPs&#8212;such as magnetic, photocatalytic, and ion&#8208;adsorptive&#8212;can be simultaneously introduced onto the MPs. The resulting HSPs can not only remove toxic water pollutants, but also be easily recovered and reused. The mechanophysical synthesis approach opens a new direction for sustainable and versatile self&#8208;assembly of heterogeneous MPs, minimizing the use of excessive chemicals and solvents.

         <title>Decoding Directional Control in Metal&#8208;Assisted Chemical Etching via Catalyst Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;assisted chemical etching (MaCE) enables silicon nanostructure fabrication but suffers from isotropic undercutting. This study highlights the critical role of catalyst morphology in etching directionality. High&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio catalysts induce lateral etching, while thermal treatment at 450&#160;&#176;C stabilizes catalyst geometry, promoting vertical etching. These findings offer a strategy for precise silicon nanostructure control, advancing semiconductor and nanofabrication applications.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;assisted chemical etching (MaCE) has emerged as a promising technique for fabricating silicon nanostructures, yet the presence of anomalous isotropic etching poses significant challenges for precise dimensional control. Here, it is demonstrated that catalyst morphology, particularly its aspect ratio, plays a crucial role in determining etching directionality. Through systematic investigation of the initial stages of MaCE, it is revealed that significant undercutting occurs within seconds of etching initiation, persisting across all solution compositions. This phenomenon is quantitatively analyzed using the Degree of Undercutting (DoU) and Degree of Anisotropy (DoA) metrics, establishing that conventional solution chemistry control alone cannot suppress lateral etching. These findings reveal that high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio dendrite catalysts, formed at elevated AgNO3 concentrations, undergo physical separation during etching, leading to residual catalysts that promote localized isotropic etching. To address this, a thermal treatment approach is developed that effectively transforms these problematic structures into stable, low&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio catalysts. A critical transition at 450&#160;&#176;C, where enhanced silver atom mobility coincides with surface defect formation, enables nearly perfect vertical etching. This work not only provides fundamental insights into the relationship between catalyst geometry and etching behavior but also presents a practical solution for achieving precise control over silicon nanostructure fabrication.

         <title>Enabling Targeted Zinc Growth via Interface Regulation Toward Binder Free and High Areal Capacity Zinc Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D self&#8208;assembled SiO2@SiO2/C nanorods crosslinked nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon fiber (SSA/NCF) networks are prepared by electrostatic spinning to promote the preferential deposition of (101) crystalline surfaces to obtain dense and flat zinc anodes. Uniform zinc ion transport and enhanced ion transfer kinetics are also achieved toward flexible, binder&#8208;free, and high&#8208;performance APLs.








Abstract
Owing to the low redox potential, abundant nature, and widespread availability, aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) have attracted extensive investigation. Nevertheless, the commercialization of the batteries is severely hindered by negative side reactions, catastrophic dendrite growth, and uneven Zn2+ diffusion. Here, 3D self&#8208;assembled necklace&#8208;like nanofibers are developed by a simple electrospinning technique, in which SiO2@SiO2/C nanospheres are sequentially aligned on interconnected nitrogen/carbon networks (SSA/NCF) to achieve binder&#8208;free, high&#8208;performance, and dendrite&#8208;free growth of APLs. The design structure combines excellent interfacial ion transfer, corrosion resistance, and unique planar deposition regulation. The protective layer of SSA/NCF paper exhibits a high affinity for Zn2+, thereby reducing the nucleation barrier of Zn2+ and ensuring a more homogeneous Zn deposit. More importantly, this multifunctional interfacial layer induces preferential crystalline (101) oriented electroplating growth and promotes oriented dense Zn deposition. Consequently, the SSA/NCF paper layer endowed the cell with remarkable cycling stability, achieving an extended cycle life of 3000&#160;h at 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2/1.25&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. This study offers novel insights into the development of high&#8208;performance zinc anodes.

         <title>Regulating Charge Distribution to Achieve High&#8208;Performance n&#8208;Type Single&#8208;Component Organic Neuromorphic Phototransistors</title>

A torsion&#8208;polarization synergy strategy utilizing cyano&#8208;functionalized thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;3,6&#8208;dicarbonitrile (2CNTT) achieves intramolecular decoupling and intermolecular polarization, optimizing exciton dissociation and charge transport. The single&#8208;component phototransistor based on 2CNTT exhibits ultralow energy consumption, high photoresponse, and synaptic functionalities, providing an efficient design strategy for multifunctional optoelectronic devices and neuromorphic applications.








Abstract
Organic optoelectronic devices are advancing toward miniaturization and integration, demanding high performance, low energy consumption, and simplified manufacturing. The development of single&#8208;component phototransistors is still in its early stages, particularly for high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors. Here, thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;3,6&#8208;dicarbonitrile (2CNTT) is developed and a cyano&#8208;mediated torsion&#8208;polarization synergy strategy is proposed to construct conjugated polymers via direct (hetero)arylation polycondensation. This structural modification promotes intramolecular decoupling and enhances intermolecular interactions, enabling intra&#8208;/interchain charge distribution to be regulated. N&#8208;type copolymers based on 2CNTT exhibited broad visible&#8208;light absorption range and small exciton binding energy, capable of stable exciton generation and stepwise dissociation. The PFIID2NTT&#8208;based single&#8208;component phototransistor showed stable unipolar electron mobility and strong photoresponse with light&#8208;current/dark&#8208;current ratio as high as 9.02 &#215; 104, and a paired&#8208;pulse facilitation index over 236% under visible light. The devices also operate at an ultra&#8208;low energy consumption (13.23 aJ), mimicking neural synapse behavior and enabling long&#8208;term memory functionality. The strategy optimizes charge distribution and exciton utilization in n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors, presenting a new paradigm for developing multifunctional organic optoelectronics.

The single-component phototransistor based on 2CNTT exhibits ultralow energy consumption, high photoresponse, and synaptic functionalities, providing an efficient design strategy for multifunctional optoelectronic devices and neuromorphic applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic optoelectronic devices are advancing toward miniaturization and integration, demanding high performance, low energy consumption, and simplified manufacturing. The development of single-component phototransistors is still in its early stages, particularly for high-performance n-type polymer semiconductors. Here, thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-3,6-dicarbonitrile (2CNTT) is developed and a cyano-mediated torsion-polarization synergy strategy is proposed to construct conjugated polymers via direct (hetero)arylation polycondensation. This structural modification promotes intramolecular decoupling and enhances intermolecular interactions, enabling intra-/interchain charge distribution to be regulated. N-type copolymers based on 2CNTT exhibited broad visible-light absorption range and small exciton binding energy, capable of stable exciton generation and stepwise dissociation. The PFIID2NTT-based single-component phototransistor showed stable unipolar electron mobility and strong photoresponse with light-current/dark-current ratio as high as 9.02 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, and a paired-pulse facilitation index over 236% under visible light. The devices also operate at an ultra-low energy consumption (13.23 aJ), mimicking neural synapse behavior and enabling long-term memory functionality. The strategy optimizes charge distribution and exciton utilization in n-type polymer semiconductors, presenting a new paradigm for developing multifunctional organic optoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Time&#8208;Resolved Ratiometric Fluorescence Nanothermometer for Real&#8208;Time Endoscopic Temperature Guidance during Tumor Ablation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a time&#8208;resolved ratiometric fluorescence nanothermometer with high quantum yield and exceptional thermal sensitivity, enabling rapid and accurate in vivo temperature imaging by eliminating the interference of wavelength&#8208;dependent signal attenuation and autofluorescence. A further developed fluorescence temperature endoscopy system overcomes the light penetration limitation, realizing real&#8208;time temperature guidance during liver tumor ablation in rabbit model.








Abstract
Thermal ablation is a common treatment option for early&#8208;stage cancers, but the lack of real&#8208;time temperature imaging feedback method increases the risk of incomplete or excessive ablation. Although ratiometric nanothermometer offers a rapid temperature imaging solution, accurate in vivo signal extraction remains challenging due to the autofluorescence and wavelength&#8208;dependent tissue absorption and scattering. Herein, a time&#8208;resolved ratiometric fluorescence nanothermometer composed of europium and iridium complex with identical working wavelength but distinguishing lifetimes is reported, whose well&#8208;designed structures enable 450&#160;nm excitation of both complexes with a high quantum yield (57.8%). Based on the nanothermometer, accurate signal extraction is realized in whole blood, beneath a 2 cm tissue phantom and a 5 mm pork slice through a time&#8208;resolved ratiometric method. By leveraging the exceptional thermal sensitivity (6.9% K&#8722;1), high temperature resolution (0.02 K), and clinically relevant temperature range (30&#8211;96&#160;&#176;C) of the nanothermometer, a fluorescence temperature endoscopy system is further designed with a real&#8208;time temperature imaging speed of 10 fps, which is applied to minimally invasive temperature monitoring during microwave ablation of liver tumors in rabbits, realizing precise ablation control through dynamic ablation power adjustment. The real&#8208;time and accurate temperature imaging performance of the nanothermometer may offer a new perspective for intraoperative guidance.

         <title>Robust Imaging through Light&#8208;Scattering Barriers via Energetically Modulated Multispectral Organic Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study examines universal strategies for electron&#8208;blocking layers in high&#8208;performance organic photodetectors by introducing a newly designed self&#8208;assembled monolayer. These strategies enable robust imaging of objects across thick light&#8208;scattering barriers under near&#8208;infrared illumination, a previously only theorized challenge in photodetection.








Abstract
Emerging technologies, such as biomedical imaging and autonomous driving, rely on low&#8208;noise near infrared (NIR) photodetectors. Organic photodetectors (OPDs) offer tremendous potential for these applications because of their seamless integration and NIR photosensing capabilities; however, their high noise levels have constrained widespread commercialization. Herein, the study demonstrates a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) NIR OPD featuring an ultralow noise current of 2.18 fA, enabled by a newly synthesized electron&#8208;blocking layer (EBL), ((2,7&#8208;dicyano&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene&#8208;9,9&#8208;diyl)bis(propane&#8208;3,1&#8208;diyl))bis(phosphonic acid) (3PAFCN). Through diverse energetic modulative design strategies, 3PAFCN enables the OPD to achieve homogenous surface properties, an elevated interfacial energy barrier, and optimized BHJ morphology, culminating in a notable specific detectivity of 2.50 &#215; 1014&#160;cm Hz0.5&#160;W&#8722;1 at 808&#160;nm illumination under white&#8208;noise conditions. These EBL design principles are broadly applicable for various photoactive materials. Demonstrations in single&#8208;pixel imaging highlight the exceptional clarity of the 3PAFCN&#8208;based OPD in low&#8208;light and foggy environments, underscoring the potential of OPD technology for advanced imaging applications.

         <title>Nanofibrous Guidance Conduits with Multiple Gradient Cues for Spinal Cord Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel guidance conduits are fabricated through electrospinning and masked coaxial electrospraying, integrating topological, haptotactic, and chemotactic cues to promote cell migration, neural stem cell differentiation, and axonal extension. In rat models, these conduits inhibited fibroblast proliferation, preserved microglial homeostasis, and promoted neuronal regeneration, significantly improving functional recovery and offering a promising strategy for spinal cord injury treatment.








Abstract
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a debilitating condition that leads to severe disabilities and imposes significant economic and social burdens. Current therapeutic strategies primarily focus on symptom management, with limited success in promoting full neurological recovery. In response to this challenge, the design of novel guidance conduits incorporating multiple gradient cues, inspired is reported by biological processes, to enhance spinal cord repair. These conduits are fabricated using electrospinning and masked coaxial electrospraying, a simple yet effective method that integrates topological, haptotactic, and chemotactic cues into a single scaffold. The synergy of these cues significantly promoted cell migration, neural stem cell differentiation into neurons, and axonal extension, resulting in substantial improvements in spinal cord regeneration and functional recovery in a rat model. Single&#8208;nucleus RNA sequencing further demonstrated that the guidance conduit inhibited fibroblast proliferation, preserved microglial homeostasis, restored cellular proportions, and facilitated the regeneration of neuronal axons, dendrites, and synapses. This work presents an innovative, versatile platform for fabricating tissue scaffolds that integrate multiple gradient cues, offering a promising strategy for SCI treatment and broader tissue regeneration applications.

         <title>Spatiotemporally Programming Microenvironment to Recapitulate Endochondral Ossification via Greenhouse&#8208;Inspired Bionic Niche</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Drawing inspiration from the functionality of the greenhouse ecosystem, this study develops a bionic niche capable of spatiotemporal programming the microenvironment to recapitulate the process of endochondral ossification (ECO). The niche successfully orchestrates the key stages of ECO, including immunomodulation, revascularization, chondrogenesis, and osteogenesis, offering a promising strategy for designing next&#8208;generation ECO&#8208;driven biomaterials in bone tissue engineering.








Abstract
Various biomaterials have been developed to address challenging critical&#8208;sized bone defects. However, most of them focus on intramembranous ossification (IMO) rather than endochondral ossification (ECO), often resulting in suboptimal therapeutic outcomes. Drawing inspiration from the functionality of the greenhouse ecosystem, herein a bionic niche is innovatively crafted to recapitulate the ECO process. This niche consists of three hierarchical components: an embedded microchannel network that facilitates cell infiltration and matter exchange, a polydopamine surface modification layer with immunomodulatory functions, and an ECO&#8208;targeted delivery system based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles. Through spatiotemporally programming of the microenvironment, the bionic niche effectively recapitulates the key stages of ECO. Notably, even in the rat calvaria, a region well&#8208;known for IMO, the bionic niche is capable of initiating ECO, evident by cartilage template formation, leading to efficient bone regeneration. Taken together, this study introduces prospective concepts for designing next&#8208;generation ECO&#8208;driven biomaterials for bone tissue engineering.

         <title>Substitution Index&#8208;Prediction Rules for Low&#8208;Potential Plateau of Hard Carbon Anodes in Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substitution index of precursor (&#916;) is established as an effective predictor for the low&#8208;potential plateau performance of hard carbon (HC) anodes in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Three carbon models&#8212;disordered carbon, closed&#8208;pore&#8208;dominated carbon, and turbostratic carbon&#8212;are constructed to validate the accuracy of &#916; and investigate the mechanisms of closed pore formation and sodium storage.








Abstract
Establishing prediction rules for the low&#8208;potential plateau (LPP) of hard carbon (HC) anodes is crucial for constructing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). While current studies suggest that the closed pores of HC can enhance the LPP performance, the rules for directly predicting the LPP from precursors have yet to be established. Here, prediction rules for the LPP of HC anodes in SIBs&#8212;the substitution index (&#916;) of precursor are introduced. Three carbon models (disordered carbon, closed&#8208;pore&#8208;dominated carbon, and turbostratic carbon) are constructed to verify the accuracy of &#916; and to explore the closed&#8208;pore formation and LPP mechanism. In detail, as the &#916; increases from 0.06 to 0.22, the LPP capacity rises from 25 to 278&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8315;&#185;, revealing a strong linear correlation between &#916; of precursor and LPP capacity. In situ XRD, Raman, and ex situ SAXS, EPR further confirm that sodium storage in HC can be categorized into adsorption (&gt;0.4&#160;V), interlayer storage (0.4 to 0.15&#160;V), and pore&#8208;filling (below 0.15&#160;V). This work not only elucidates the sodium storage mechanisms, but also provides one efficient design guideline for advanced carbon anodes in SIBs.

         <title>Highly Efficient Wavelength Red&#8208;Shift Regulating Strategy of Carbon Dots Composites via the Effective Conjugated Domain and the Hydrogen Bonding Synergy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study uses a structurally fixed conjugation molecule as a precursor. It efficiently forms carbon core states of carbon dots. This approach optimizes the control over the conjugated domain size of the carbon core. It also significantly enhances the synthetic efficiency of CDs and the tunability of the optical properties.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials hold significant potential for applications in lighting, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and multi&#8208;level information encryption. However, regulating RTP emission wavelengths, especially shifting into the red spectral region, remains challenging due to the spin&#8208;forbidden transitions of triplet&#8208;state excitons and non&#8208;radiative decay. To address this issue, carbon dots (CDs) with different conjugated domain sizes and phosphorescent potential are designed and synthesized. The CDs are then encapsulated in polyacrylamide (PAM), resulting in multicolored RTP emission ranging from cyan to red (465&#8211;635 nm), with cyan and red phosphorescence exceeding 10 s and 2 s, respectively. The mechanism suggests that the enhanced conjugation effect leads to energy level splitting and strengthened electron coupling, which lowers the energy gap between singlet and triplet excitons, ultimately causing a redshift in the phosphorescent emission wavelength. Meanwhile, the introduction of hydrogen bonding protects the excited state of the electrons, suppresses non&#8208;radiative transitions, and induces RTP in the CDs. These materials are applied in multi&#8208;level information encryption and time&#8208;delayed LED illumination, offering novel strategies for high&#8208;security technologies and advanced optical devices.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Controlled Redox Chemistry in Aqueous Mn2&#8314;/MnO&#8322; Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>

The study explores how interfacial redox mediation influences Mn2&#8314;/MnO&#8322; conversion, focusing on local environmental regulation. It is found that the VO2&#8314;/VO&#8322;&#8314; redox couple stabilizes pH, controls H&#8322;O activity, and mediates Mn3&#8314;, enabling 100% Mn2&#8314;/MnO&#8322; conversion. This approach suppresses Mn degradation, extends electrode lifespan, and achieves record&#8208;high electrode capacity (100&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2), offering a breakthrough for static Mn2+/MnO2 batteries.








Abstract
Manganese dioxide (MnO2) deposition/dissolution (Mn2+/MnO2) chemistry, involving a two&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer process, holds promise for safe and eco&#8208;friendly large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, challenges like electrode/electrolyte interface environment fluctuations (H+ and H2O activity), irreversible Mn degradation, and limited understanding of degradation mechanisms hinder the reversibility of the Mn2+/MnO2 conversion. This study demonstrates a vanadyl/pervanadyl (VO2+/VO2+) redox&#8208;mediated interface designed for high&#8208;energy Mn2+/MnO2 batteries. Unlike flow systems, this work uncovers, for the first time, the mechanism of a static redox&#8208;mediated interface in regulating interfacial H+ and H2O activities. Significantly, the VO2+/VO2+ chemical redox mediation targets Mn3+ intermediates, suppressing their hydrolysis and enabling 100% Mn2+/MnO2 conversion. The redox&#8208;mediated interface enhances the Mn redox electron transfer process, achieving a stable &#8776;95% coulombic efficiency and ultrahigh capacity of 100&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 with an areal energy density of 111&#160;mWh&#160;cm&#8722;2, outperforming flow systems. The electrode also exhibits an average specific capacity of 593&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, approaching the theoretical limit of 616&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, and a specific energy density of 721&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 at high MnO2 loadings (50&#8211;150&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2). The findings highlight the critical role of interfacial redox mediation in regulating H+ and H2O activities and underscore the significance of interface dynamics.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Assembling Composite Structural Design for the Conversion of Hydroxyl&#8208;Anchored Bonds Obtains High Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

The detailed mechanisms governing the adsorption dynamics between SAMs and ITO delve into and promote homogeneous and stable SAMs film by converting the originally weak bonds anchored through physical interactions into strong bonds, helping PSCs achieve a high power conversion efficiency of 26.37%.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) serve as the hole&#8208;transporting layer (HTL) in perovskite solar cells, yet their instability on indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates poses a challenge in practical. The typical SAMs are susceptible to solvents during the perovskite layer deposition process which can result in being washed or dislodged, thereby impeding the formation of a dense SAM. Here, a novel guanidine&#8208;modified polyurethane siloxane elastomers is synthesized to enhance the anchoring capability of SAMs on ITO, which exhibits strong interactions with [2&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl] phosphonic acid (MeO&#8208;2PACz) SAMs, to co&#8208;construct a self&#8208;assembled composite structure (SACS). By utilizing this anchor strategy, the weakly bonded MeO&#8208;2PACz adhering to ITO can be converted into a strongly bonded form, thereby curtailing the migration of MeO&#8208;2PACz on the ITO surface during the spin&#8208;coating process, as well as inhibiting shedding that may occur due to solvent washing during the device preparation process. SACS SAMs heighten the charge collection ability of SAMs and suppress interfacial recombination, as well as enhance the growth of the upper perovskite layer. Finally, the SACS&#8208;based SAMs device with a power conversion efficiency of 26.37%. The unencapsulated device based on SACS SAMs can be stored for at least 5000&#160;h with little degradation in performance.

SACS SAMs heighten the charge collection ability of SAMs and suppress interfacial recombination, as well as enhance the growth of the upper perovskite layer. Finally, the SACS-based SAMs device with a power conversion efficiency of 26.37%. The unencapsulated device based on SACS SAMs can be stored for at least 5000&#160;h with little degradation in performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Facile Strategy for Textile&#8208;Based Highly Sensitive and Water&#8208;Resistant Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new amplified micro&#8208;deformation strategy is proposed to develop a 3D fabric&#8208;based F&#8208;TENG with 3D conductive PPy network and a water&#8208;resistant WPU layer. The device enables highly sensitive and real&#8208;time physiological monitoring, maintains stable performance in both in vivo and skin surface wet conditions, and exhibits excellent antibacterial properties. F&#8208;TENG is expected to achieve the application of integrated diagnosis and treatment.









Abstract
The demand for real&#8208;time physiological monitoring drives innovation in triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). TENGs offer promise for real&#8208;time dynamic monitoring, but they are often complicated to manufacture, have low sensitivity, and are easily disturbed by ambient humidity. Herein, a fabric&#8208;based integrated triboelectric nanogenerator (F&#8208;TENG) is developed, employing waterborne polyurethane (WPU) as both a water&#8208;resistant encapsulation and friction layer, and polypyrrole (PPy) as a friction and conductive layer. This design simplifies the fabrication process while simultaneously improving the device's resistance to environmental factors. The micro&#8208;filament structure enables localized contact&#8208;separation during deformation, initiating the triboelectric effect, while the 3D architecture amplifies local strain, further enhancing sensitivity to weak signals. F&#8208;TENG demonstrates effective voltage output during carotid and respiratory monitoring, highlighting its capability to detect subtle physiological signals. Furthermore, F&#8208;TENG maintains stable performance under humid conditions, retaining 78.78% of its output voltage as relative humidity increased from 20% to 80%. When implants in the moist environment of a rat's leg, F&#8208;TENG exhibits a notable output of 21&#160;V. In addition, the inherent antibacterial properties of F&#8208;TENG further enhance its application potential. These findings position F&#8208;TENG as a robust and versatile platform for dynamic monitoring, wearable electronics, and integrated diagnostic and therapeutic systems.

         <title>Rational Regulation of Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Processed Active Layer via Trimer&#8208;Induced Pre&#8208;Swelling Strategy for Efficient and Robust Thick&#8208;Film Organic Solar Cells</title>

Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer deposition technology is combined with a trimer&#8208;induced pre&#8208;swelling (TIP) strategy by incorporating a 3D star&#8208;shaped trimer (BTT&#8208;Out) into the buried D18 donor layer to construct thick&#8208;film OSCs. A best performance of 20.3% (thin&#8208;film) and 18.8% (thick&#8208;film) with upgraded stability is achieved in TIP devices, among one of the highest performances reported of thick&#8208;film OSCs.








Abstract
Thick&#8208;film (&gt;300 nm) organic solar cells (OSCs) have garnered intensifying attention due to their compatibility with commercial roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll printing technology for the large&#8208;scale continuous fabrication process. However, due to the uncontrollable donor/acceptor (D/A) arrangement in thick&#8208;film condition, the restricted exciton splitting and severe carrier traps significantly impede the photovoltaic performance and operability. Herein, combined with layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer deposition technology, a twisted 3D star&#8208;shaped trimer (BTT&#8208;Out) is synthesized to develop a trimer&#8208;induced pre&#8208;swelling (TIP) strategy, where the BTT&#8208;Out is incorporated into the buried D18 donor layer to enable the fabrication of thick&#8208;film OSCs. The integrated approach characterizations reveal that the exceptional configuration and spontaneous self&#8208;organization behavior of BTT&#8208;Out trimer could pre&#8208;swell the D18 network to facilitate the acceptor's infiltration and accelerate the formation of D/A interfaces. This enhancement triggers the elevated polarons formation with amplified hole&#8208;transfer kinetics, which is essential for the augmented exciton splitting efficiency. Furthermore, the regulated swelling process can initiate the favorable self&#8208;assembly of L8&#8208;BO acceptors, which would ameliorate carrier transport channels and mitigate carrier traps. As a result, the TIP&#8208;modified thin&#8208;film OSC devices achieve the champion performance of 20.3% (thin&#8208;film) and 18.8% (thick&#8208;film) with upgraded stability, among one of the highest performances reported of thick&#8208;film OSCs.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Driven Stabilization of Noble Metal Single Atoms: Advancing Ammonia Synthesis and Energy Output in Zinc&#8208;Nitrate Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposed an innovative entropy&#8208;driven strategy, demonstrating that the (CePrYZrHf)Ox high&#8208;entropy oxide substrate can accommodate more Ru single atoms than the traditional low&#8208;entropy single oxides such as CeO2, and achieve excellent performance in ammonia electrosynthesis and energy output of zinc&#8208;nitrate batteries.








Abstract
Noble metal single atoms (NMSA) offer exceptional atom utilization and catalytic activity but face challenges like limited stability, low atomic loading, and complex synthesis. This study presents an innovative entropy&#8208;driven strategy to stabilize Ru single atoms (SA) on a (CePrYZrHf)Ox high&#8208;entropy oxide substrate (Ru&#945;%&#8208;HEO). Due to their defect&#8208;rich structure and significant lattice distortion, HEO substrates can accommodate and stabilize more Ru SA than traditional low&#8208;entropy oxides (LEO) like CeO2. This strategy is also effective for achieving high loadings&#160;of other NMSAs, such as Pd and Pt. Ru3%&#8208;HEO, as an electrocatalyst for nitrate reduction, achieves a high ammonia yield (5.79 mg h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1) and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 91.3%. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Ru3%&#8208;HEO exhibits favorable thermodynamics for nitrate reduction, with a lower energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of first hydrogenation (*NO + H+ + e&#8315; &#8594; *NOH) and stronger intermediates adsorption compared to RuO2, enhancing its catalytic efficiency. As a cathode material in a zinc&#8208;nitrate battery, Ru3%&#8208;HEO demonstrates a high NH3 yield rate (1.11 mg&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2) and FE value (93.4%). This study provides an efficient strategy to produce stable and high&#8208;loading SA using high&#8208;entropy materials, showcasing their broad applicability in advanced electrocatalysis.

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence&#8208;Guided Photodynamic Therapy Through Skeleton&#8208;Homologous Nanoparticles: a Rational Material Design for High&#8208;Efficient and High&#8208;Contrast Theranostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational design of skeleton&#8208;homologous nanoparticles for highly efficient and high&#8208;contrast theranostics is reported. The nanoparticles synchronously exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (40&#160;&#181;s) and generate multiple ROS, enabling TRI&#8208;guided PDT, where TRI eliminates the background noise and guides PDT accurately.








Abstract
Although photoluminescence imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) is promising for theranostics, it easily suffers from tissue autofluorescence and PDT photoproducts. To develop time&#8208;resolved imaging (TRI)&#8208;guided PDT with long&#8208;lived emission pathways, like thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), is urgent but challenging, because of the triplet competition between radiative transition and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Herein, skeleton&#8208;homologous nanoparticles are designed and constructed to address this dilemma, thereby achieving in vivo TRI&#8208;guided PDT for the first time. This system is formed with a lipophilic TADF core (as a TRI probe) encapsulated by an amphiphilic photosensitizer shell (as the corona exposed to oxygen for PDT), both of which are derived from the same donor&#8211;acceptor skeleton to minimize phase separation in the single entity, and enable the same long&#8208;wavelength photoexcitation for TRI and PDT. The chloropropylamine group is helpful for endoplasmic reticulum targeting to enhance PDT upon minimizing the ROS transmission path. Synchronously, the TADF core exhibits a delayed fluorescence of 40 &#181;s for a clear TRI. The NPs are eventually applied in vivo with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (45.25) and outstanding PDT effects in a mouse model of deep&#8208;seated kidney cancer. Such a material design is beneficial for developing high&#8208;efficient and high&#8208;contrast theranostic approaches.

     alt="Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence-Guided Photodynamic Therapy Through Skeleton-Homologous Nanoparticles: a Rational Material Design for High-Efficient and High-Contrast Theranostics"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rational design of skeleton-homologous nanoparticles for highly efficient and high-contrast theranostics is reported. The nanoparticles synchronously exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (40&#160;&#181;s) and generate multiple ROS, enabling TRI-guided PDT, where TRI eliminates the background noise and guides PDT accurately.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although photoluminescence imaging-guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) is promising for theranostics, it easily suffers from tissue autofluorescence and PDT photoproducts. To develop time-resolved imaging (TRI)-guided PDT with long-lived emission pathways, like thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), is urgent but challenging, because of the triplet competition between radiative transition and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Herein, skeleton-homologous nanoparticles are designed and constructed to address this dilemma, thereby achieving in vivo TRI-guided PDT for the first time. This system is formed with a lipophilic TADF core (as a TRI probe) encapsulated by an amphiphilic photosensitizer shell (as the corona exposed to oxygen for PDT), both of which are derived from the same donor&#8211;acceptor skeleton to minimize phase separation in the single entity, and enable the same long-wavelength photoexcitation for TRI and PDT. The chloropropylamine group is helpful for endoplasmic reticulum targeting to enhance PDT upon minimizing the ROS transmission path. Synchronously, the TADF core exhibits a delayed fluorescence of 40 &#181;s for a clear TRI. The NPs are eventually applied in vivo with a high signal-to-background ratio (45.25) and outstanding PDT effects in a mouse model of deep-seated kidney cancer. Such a material design is beneficial for developing high-efficient and high-contrast theranostic approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Artificial Cells Capable of NO&#160;Generation with Light Controllable Membraneless Organelles for Melanoma Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;induced membraneless organelles (MLOs) are formed in artificial cells upon light irradiation. The enrichment of iNOS+ in MLOs increases the production rate of NO 3.2 times of that without MLOs. Artificial cells containing light&#8208;induced MLOs are utilized to treat melanoma efficiently.









Abstract
Membraneless organelles (MLOs) formed by liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation exhibit diverse important biofunctions in cells. The construction of artificial cells containing MLOs with enhanced complexity and functions is still challenging. Here a light&#8208;responsive protein, Cry2olig&#8208;IDRs, is designed and purified to form MLOs upon light (488&#160;nm) irradiation. They are capable of rapidly recruiting positively charged inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS+) from surroundings to regulate its activity for NO production. NO&#8208;artificial cells are constructed by encapsulating Cry2olig&#8208;IDRs and iNOS+ into giant unilamellar vesicles, which are capable of rapid production of NO with high concentration due to the formation of MLOs upon light irradiation. NO&#8208;artificial cells are confirmed to possess the ability for melanoma tumor therapy in mice. These findings provide an efficient method for remotely regulating enzyme activity inside artificial cells, paving the path to build more sophisticated artificial cells for their biomedical applications.

         <title>Organic Solar Cell with Efficiency of 20.49% Enabled by Solid Additive and Non&#8208;Halogenated Solvent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a feasible solid additive strategy to enhance the performance of organic solar cells. The 4&#8208;nitro&#8208;benzonitrile (NBN)&#8208;treated device owned enhanced molecular crystallinity, more efficient exciton dissociation, suppressed charge recombination, and more favorable morphology. Record efficiency of 20.22% and 20.49% are obtained in binary and ternary devices processed by non&#8208;halogenated solvent. NBN is applicable to multiple efficient systems.








Abstract
Recently, benzene&#8208;based solid additives (BSAs) have emerged as pivotal components in modulating the morphology of the blend film in organic solar cells (OSCs). However, since almost all substituents on BSAs are weak electron&#8208;withdrawing groups and contain halogen atoms, the study of BSAs with non&#8208;halogenated strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups has received little attention. Herein, an additive strategy is proposed, involving the incorporation of non&#8208;halogenated strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on the benzene ring. An effective BSA, 4&#8208;nitro&#8208;benzonitrile (NBN), is selected to boost the efficiency of devices. The results demonstrate that the NBN&#8208;treated device exhibits enhanced light absorption, superior charge transport performance, mitigated charge recombination, and more optimal morphology compared to the additive&#8208;free OSC. Consequently, the D18:BTP&#8208;eC9+NBN&#8208;based binary device and D18:L8&#8208;BO:BTP&#8208;eC9+NBN&#8208;based ternary OSC processed by non&#8208;halogenated solvent achieved outstanding efficiencies of 20.22% and 20.49%, respectively. Furthermore, the universality of NBN is also confirmed in different active layer systems. In conclusion, this work demonstrates that the introduction of non&#8208;halogenated strong electron&#8208;absorbing moieties on the benzene ring is a promising approach to design BSAs, which can tune the film morphology and achieve highly efficient devices, and has certain guiding significance for the development of BSAs.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Co&#8211;Ru Dimer Catalyst Boosts Conversion of Polysulfides toward High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed Co&#8722;Ru dimer catalyst synthesized by a confined pyrolysis strategy shows the orbital coupling effect derived from the atomic pair, which could reduce energy barrier of lithium polysulfides conversion and Li2S dissociation, thus accelerating the catalytic kinetics and achieving the enhanced Li&#8722;S battery performance.








Abstract
The sluggish sulfur redox reaction in lithium&#8722;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries triggers the development of highly active electrocatalysts for accelerating the polysulfides conversion kinetics. Rational design of catalysts with satisfactory active sites and high atom utilization toward multistep sulfur&#8208;based conversion is much desired but remains challenging. Here, it is shown that the well&#8208;designed Co&#8722;Ru dimer sites confined on carbon matrix could effectively manipulate the sulfur&#8208;involved conversion reactions and thus improve Li&#8722;S batteries performance. The orbital coupling of Co&#8722;Ru dimer induces the orbital regulation for the atomic pair, resulting the favored lithium polysulfides adsorption strength and lowed conversion energy barrier, as confirmed by systematic electrochemical characterizations and theoretical calculation. Besides, the intrinsic catalytic activity of Ru from Co&#8211;Ru moiety also accelerates the Li2S dissociation reaction. Taken together, the as&#8208;constructed Co&#8211;Ru dimer sites render the Li&#8722;S battery with excellent performance, delivering energy density of 468&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 of total assembled pouch cell. This study offers a rational design of catalysts for boosting the catalytic performance in Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Weak Dipole Effect Customized Zinc Ion&#8208;Rich Protective Layer for Lean&#8208;Electrolyte Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zwitterionic protective layer is engineered on Zn surface by weak dipole effect of TMAO. The weak dipole effect realizes Zn ion&#8208;rich environment to alleviate the concentration polarization on electrolyte/Zn interface and exhibits short range interaction with free water to inhibit side reactions, thereby achieving enhanced performance for both symmetrical and full batteries with lean&#8208;electrolyte.








Abstract
The industrial development of Zn&#8208;ion batteries requires high performance even with lean&#8208;electrolyte. Nevertheless, lean&#8208;electrolyte can exacerbate concentration polarization at the interface of electrode/electrolyte, leading to significant Zn corrosion and battery failure. Here, a stable Zn ion&#8208;rich protective layer (TMAO&#8208;Zn) is constructed by a unique zwitterion structure of trimethylamine N&#8208;oxide (TMAO). The TMAO is characterized by the direct connection between positive and negative charges (N+&#8208;O&#8722;) with minimal dipole moment, which renders weak dipole interactions to form the TMAO&#8208;Zn layer with Zn2+, thereby reducing concentration polarization and promoting the rapid and uniform deposition of Zn2+. Furthermore, the O of TMAO&#8208;Zn exhibits the higher electrophilic index, indicating a stronger propensity for stable hydrogen bond interactions with active free water in the inner Helmholtz layer (IHL), thereby mitigating corrosion under extreme conditions of low electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;capacity ratio (E/C ratio). Consequently, the symmetrical Zn battery with TMAO&#8208;Zn enables stable cycling for over 250&#160;h with lean&#8208;electrolyte of 15&#160;&#181;L&#160;mA&#160;h&#8722;1. Additionally, Zn/I&#8322; pouch battery with a low E/C ratio of 21.2&#160;&#181;L&#160;mA&#160;h&#8722;1 provides ultra&#8208;high stable specific capacity of 96&#160;mA&#160;h for over 250 cycles (capacity retention rate of 98.3%). This study offers a new concept to propel the practical application of Zn batteries with lean&#8208;electrolyte.

Additionally, Zn/I&#8322; pouch battery with a low E/C ratio of 21.2&#160;&#181;L&#160;mA&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; provides ultra-high stable specific capacity of 96&#160;mA&#160;h for over 250 cycles (capacity retention rate of 98.3%). This study offers a new concept to propel the practical application of Zn batteries with lean-electrolyte.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quantifying Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance Induced Enhancement on Metal@Cu2O Composites for Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal@Cu2O composites are developed as platforms to investigate the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) induced enhancement on photoelectrocatalysis. The contributions of two LSPR mechanisms, plasmon&#8208;induced resonance energy transfer (PIRET) and hot electron transfer (HET), to the photocurrent are quantified using different bands of incident light, providing a quantitative understanding of the role of PIRET and HET in boosting photoelectrocatalysis.








Abstract
The localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of metal nanoparticles can substantially enhance the activity of photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) reactions. However, quantifying the respective contributions of different LSPR mechanisms to the enhancement of PEC performance remains an urgent challenge. In this work, Cu@Cu2O composites prepared by annealing Cu2O under an inert atmosphere and electrodeposited metal@Cu2O composites (MED@Cu2O, MED = CuED, AuED, AgED, PdED, PtED) are employed as platform materials to investigate the LSPR effect on the PEC hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). All the composites exhibited remarkably LSPR&#8208;enhanced activity toward PEC HER. The contributions of two LSPR mechanisms, plasmon induced resonance energy transfer (PIRET) and hot electron transfer (HET), to the photocurrent on Cu@Cu2O and CuED@Cu2O are quantified by using different bands of incident light. Moreover, using MED@Cu2O composites, the effects of both the metal species and the applied potential on HET are quantitatively investigated. The results reveal that a pronounced HET enhancement occurs only when the LSPR peak energy is lower than the semiconductor bandgap energy (Eg) and that HET strengthens as the applied potential becomes more negative for PEC HER. This work therefore provides a quantitative understanding of the roles of PIRET and HET in boosting PEC activity.

         <title>Solid Polymer Electrolyte with Dual Lewis&#8208;Acid Filler for Ultra&#8208;Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study reveals that Li+ transference number (t+), concentration (C0), and diffusion coefficient (D) critically influence dendrite growth in SPEs. By developing dual&#8208;Lewis&#8208;acid fillers, these parameters are simultaneously enhanced, and constructed a stable inorganic SEI layer. The optimized electrolyte enables high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;metal batteries with NCM811/NCM622/LFP cathodes under demanding operating conditions.








Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are regarded as promising candidates that could address the safety concerns associated with liquid electrolytes. Nonetheless, SPEs are still confronting serious lithium dendrite issues, and there is a lack of systematic studies regarding the formation of lithium dendrites within SPEs. Herein, Sand equation is employed to elucidate the determinants of dendrite growth in SPEs, revealing that three factors including the Li+ transference number, Li+ diffusion coefficient, and Li+ concentration are positively correlated with Sand's time (&#964;) which determine the plating/striping behaviors of Li anode. More importantly, an effective and universal approach is proposed to construct dendrite&#8208;free polymer lithium metal batteries with dual&#8208;Lewis&#8208;acid materials such as Zinc Borate (ZB). Endowed with ZB materials, the PVDF&#8208;HFP based electrolyte possesses sufficient Li+ supply and swift transport channel and thus achieves an impressively high Li+ transference number of 0.9 and outstanding ionic conductivity at 30&#160;&#176;C (9.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1), outperforming the polymer electrolytes with single Lewis&#8208;acid fillers. The electrolyte imparts the LFP//Li cell with exceptional capacity retention, showing almost no decay in discharge capacity even after 700, 500, and 300 cycles at 2 C, 3 C, and 5 C, respectively. Additionally, it capacitates the LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2//Li cell to outperform by achieving over 1900 cycles at 1C and stably cycling under a cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5V.

         <title>Anisotropy&#8208;Dependent Decay of Room Temperature Metastable Skyrmions and a Nascent Double&#8208;q Spin Texture in Co8Zn9Mn3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metastable skyrmions in chiral cubic Co8Zn9Mn3 are shown to exhibit decay dynamics influenceable by varying the magnetic anisotropy at room temperature, revealing a new avenue for control of topological magnetism. This study further uncovers a nascent square&#8208;coordinated spin texture that coexists with hexagonal skyrmion lattices, highlighting a rich topological landscape. The findings may enable advanced applications based on dynamic and customizable properties of topological spin textures at room temperature.








Abstract
Chiral cubic Co&#8208;Zn&#8208;Mn magnets exhibit diverse topological spin textures, including room&#8208;temperature skyrmion phases and robust far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium metastable states. Despite recent advances in understanding metastable skyrmions, the interplay between compositional disorder and varying magnetic anisotropy on the stability and decay of metastable textures, particularly near room temperature, remains incompletely understood. In this work, the equilibrium and metastable skyrmion formation in Co8Zn9Mn3 is examined, revealing transformations between distinct metastable spin textures induced by temperature and magnetic field. At room temperature, the decay dynamics of metastable skyrmions exhibits a strong dependence on magnetic anisotropy, showcasing a route towards tailoring relaxation behavior. Furthermore, a nascent double&#8208;q spin texture, characterized by two coexisting magnetic modulation vectors q, is identified as a minority phase alongside the conventional triple&#8208;q hexagonal skyrmion lattice. This double&#8208;q texture can be quenched as a metastable state, suggesting both its topological character, and its role as a potential intermediary of metastable skyrmion decay. These findings provide new insights into the tunability of equilibrium and metastable topological spin textures via chemical composition and magnetic anisotropy, offering strategies for designing materials with customizable and dynamic skyrmion properties for advanced technological&#160;applications.

         <title>Gradient Doping for Stress&#8208;Relief in Vapor&#8208;deposited Perovskite Film to Achieve High&#8208;performance p&#8208;i&#8208;n Perovskite Solar Cells with a 23% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gradient doping strategy based on vapor deposition is proposed, which effectively reduces the crystallization rate at the bottom layer, promotes uniform crystallization, and applies pre&#8208;compressive stress to the surface of the perovskite film, thereby effectively alleviating the residual stress and achieving a PCE of 23.0% for p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs with vapor&#8208;deposited perovskite.








Abstract
Vapor&#8208;deposited p&#8208;i&#8208;n perovskite solar cells (PSCs) present key advantages such as low cost, excellent stability, low&#8208;temperature fabrication, and compatibility with tandem architectures, positioning them as strong contenders for industrial&#8208;scale solar applications. However, their power conversion efficiency (PCE) remains lower than that of n&#8208;i&#8208;p architectures. Herein, a gradient doping strategy to alleviate the stress in vapor&#8208;deposited perovskite films is introduced. Gradient chloride doping in the perovskite precursor film effectively slows the crystallization rate at the bottom layer, facilitating uniform crystallization and mitigating residual strain. This method yielded high&#8208;quality perovskite films, achieving a PCE of 23.0% for p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs with vapor&#8208;deposited perovskite and 21.43% for entirely vapor&#8208;deposited PSCs. Additionally, the devices demonstrates outstanding stability, showing negligible performance degradation over 1600 h of nitrogen storage and maintaining 87.3% of their initial PCE after 500 h of maximum power point tracking under 1&#8208;sun equivalent illumination at 70% relative humidity. The gradient doping strategy provides valuable insights for advancing large&#8208;area and perovskite&#8208;textured silicon tandem solar cells.

Gradient chloride doping in the perovskite precursor film effectively slows the crystallization rate at the bottom layer, facilitating uniform crystallization and mitigating residual strain. This method yielded high-quality perovskite films, achieving a PCE of 23.0% for p-i-n PSCs with vapor-deposited perovskite and 21.43% for entirely vapor-deposited PSCs. Additionally, the devices demonstrates outstanding stability, showing negligible performance degradation over 1600 h of nitrogen storage and maintaining 87.3% of their initial PCE after 500 h of maximum power point tracking under 1-sun equivalent illumination at 70% relative humidity. The gradient doping strategy provides valuable insights for advancing large-area and perovskite-textured silicon tandem solar cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Two&#8208;Layer Graphite Anode for Energy and Power Densified LiFePO4 Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work identifies the lithium plating failure mechanism in energy&#8208;type and power&#8208;type single&#8208;layer graphite electrodes. Based on this, a two&#8208;layer graphite anode is designed and scaled up, with energy&#8208;type graphite on the top and power&#8208;type graphite on the bottom. This design inhibits lithium plating and greatly extends the lifespan of energy and power&#8208;densified LFP batteries.








Abstract
Lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries are increasingly adopted in grid&#8208;scale energy storage due to their superior performance and cost metrics. However, as the desired energy and power are further densified, the lifespan of LiFePO4 batteries is significantly limited, mainly because the lithium plating severely occurs on the graphite anode. Here, first the lithium plating characteristics of both energy&#8208;type and power&#8208;type graphite electrodes in single&#8208;layer design are deciphered. Based on these findings, a suitable two&#8208;layer design with energy&#8208;type graphite on the top layer and power&#8208;type one on the bottom layer, is disclosed. Such configuration effectively inhibits lithium plating throughout the graphite electrode, drastically increasing the lifespan in an energy&#8208; and power&#8208;densified LiFePO4 battery. The assembled pouch cell with an energy density of 161.5&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, delivers a capacity retention rate of 90.8% after 2000 cycles at 2&#160;C. This work provides valuable insights into the failure mechanism of graphite electrodes, but also innovative strategies of electrode engineering for extending batteries&#8217; performance horizon.

         <title>Highly Coupled Dynamically Modulated Electrocatalysts on Wafer&#8208;Scale InGaN/GaN Nanowires on Silicon for Successive Acidic Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sluggish water oxidation kinetics on photoanodes under strongly acidic conditions not only limit the photocurrent but also induce severe photocorrosion. Here, loading a CoRuOX cocatalyst&#8212;exhibiting a unique dynamic electron modulation effect&#8212;onto wafer&#8208;scale InGaN nanowires achieves a dual breakthrough in both oxidation activity and stability for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation under strongly acidic conditions. This strategy offers a promising pathway for sustained PEC water oxidation in acidic environments.








Abstract
Photoelectrochemical water splitting is considered one of the most promising paths for sustainable hydrogen production. However, the sluggish kinetics of the water oxidation reaction and poor stability of the photoanode significantly limit the overall performance of the photoelectrochemical device, particularly under acidic conditions, which poses great challenges for practical applications. Herein, the coupling of unique CoRuOx nanoclusters with dynamic electronic modulation effects to wafer&#8208;scale InGaN nanowires is proposed, demonstrating superior photoelectrochemical activity and stability for acidic water oxidation. Compared with InGaN nanowires loaded with typical RuO&#8322; cocatalysts, CoRuOx/InGaN photoanodes achieve a remarkable improvement in applied bias photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency from 0.77% to 2.25%, with stable operation for over 500&#160;min under strongly acidic conditions. Such boosted performance is attributed mainly to Co induced dynamic electronic modulation, which enhances oxygen evolution while maintaining the stable operation of CoRuOx/InGaN photoanodes. Initially, the Co sites increased the oxidation state of Ru, enhancing the activity of oxygen evolution. Moreover, during PEC operation, the Co sites stabilized the Ru sites, preventing dissolution of cocatalyst. This unique self&#8208;adaptive process significantly enhances the stability and activity of the photoanode, opening an effective avenue to achieve efficient and durable photoanodes for PEC applications.

         <title>Dual Doping of N and F on Co3O4 to Activate the Lattice Oxygen for Efficient and Robust Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel plasma strategy is reported to introduce N and F in Co3O4 (N, F&#8208;Co3O4) simultaneously as the heteroatoms, which enables the OER to occur via the lattice oxygen mechanism. The N, F&#8208;Co3O4 sample exhibits superior OER performance with a low overpotential and superior stability.








Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a pivotal process in numerous renewable energy conversion technologies. However, its sluggish intrinsic kinetics and intricate transfer process impede the efficient conversion of energy. Activating the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) is of paramount importance to break through the theoretical scaling relationship and boost the oxygen evolution catalytic activity. In this contribution, N and F are successfully introduced into Co3O4 simultaneously as heteroatoms via a controllable plasma strategy to modulate the covalency property of metal&#8208;oxygen. Theoretical simulations and experiment results demonstrated that the covalency of the cobalt&#8208;oxygen bond is significantly enhanced under the synergistic effect of N and F, successfully triggering the LOM pathway and facilitating the OER process. The N, F&#8208;Co3O4 composite displays an impressive OER performance, exhibiting a low overpotential of 254&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and remarkable stability at 20, 150, and 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. In addition, The N, F&#8208;Co3O4 also exhibits&#160;a low overpotential of 285&#160;mV at 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 1 m KOH + 0.5&#160;m NaCl solution, and remarkable performance on overall water splitting. This work offers profound insights into the OER mechanism and a crucial strategy for enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of spinel oxides.

         <title>Insight into the Role of Closed&#8208;Pore Size on Rate Capability of Hard Carbon for Fast&#8208;Charging Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The correlation between closed&#8208;pore size and Na&#8208;filling potentials and their influence on fast charging performance is unveiled. Smaller closed pores exhibit higher Na&#8208;filling potentials, thereby preventing Na plating at high current rates. A 2.2 Ah pouch cell incorporating optimizes hard carbon material with closed micropores (1.6 nm) and P2&#8208;type layered oxide positive electrodes enables 10 min charging for &#8776;90% of the capacity.








Abstract
The sluggish Na ion diffusion kinetics and Na metal plating in hard carbon negative electrodes restrict the fast&#8208;charging of sodium&#8208;ion batteries, which is intricately entwined with the crystal structure and pore structure. Here, the pore structures of hard carbon materials are focused on and reveal that the pore size significantly affects the Na&#8208;filling potentials during the sodiation process. Specifically, the micro closed pores exhibit higher Na&#8208;filling potentials, which reduces risks of Na metal plating at high current densities, thus enabling improved rate performance. As a result, the optimized hard carbon with closed micropores (1.6&#160;nm) achieves an initial capacity exceeding 400 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20&#160;mA g&#8722;1 and a plateau retention rate of 73.3% at a current density of 500&#160;mA g&#8722;1. Paired with P2&#8208;type layered oxide positive electrodes, the 2.2 Ah pouch cell shows 10&#160;min charging for &#8776;90% of the capacity and &#8776;90% capacity retention after 1500 cycles at a 6C rate. This work establishes a bridge between pore size and rate performance, offering guidance for the design of fast&#8208;charging sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Rational Design of Highly Stable and Active Single&#8208;Atom Modified S&#8208;MXene as Cathode Catalysts for Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) and Li&#8322;S oxidation process on single&#8208;atom&#8208;modified S&#8208;functionalized MXenes (SA&#8208;S&#8208;MXenes) monolayers are investigated. Five SA adsorption sites are considered: fcc (I), hcp (II), top (III), M substitution by SA (IV), and S substitution by SA (V). Among these, Ni, Cu, and Zn at the IV site exhibit the best electrocatalytic performance, characterized by the lowest Gibbs free energy for the SRR process and the decomposition barrier for Li&#8322;S.








Abstract
The practical application of Li&#8208;S batteries is hindered by the shuttle effect and sluggish sulfur conversion kinetics. To address these challenges, this work proposes an efficient strategy by introducing single atoms (SAs) into sulfur&#8208;functionalized MXenes (S&#8208;MXenes) catalysts and evaluate their potential in Li&#8208;S batteries through first&#8208;principles calculations. Using high&#8208;throughput screening of various SA&#8208;modified S&#8208;MXenes, this work identifies 73 promising candidates that exhibit exceptional thermodynamic and kinetic stability, along with the effective immobilization of polysulfides. Notably, the incorporation of Ni, Cu, or Zn as SAs into S&#8208;MXenes results in a significant Gibbs free energy barrier reduction by 51%&#8211;75%, outperforming graphene&#8208;based catalysts. This reduction arises from SA&#8208;induced surface electron density that influences the adsorption energies of intermediates and thereby disrupts the scaling relations between Li&#8322;S&#8322; and other key intermediates. Further enhancement in catalytic performance is achieved through strain engineering by shifting the d&#8208;band center of metal atoms to higher energy levels, increasing the chemical affinity for intermediates. To elucidate the intrinsic adsorption properties of intermediates, this work develops a machine learning model with high accuracy (R2 = 0.88), which underscores the pivotal roles of SA electronegativity and local coordination environment in determining adsorption strength, offering valuable insights for the rational design of catalysts.

         <title>Biophysical&#8208;Inspired Interpenetrated Fibrillar and Reticular Collagen Scaffold with Vascular Endothelial Cell Membrane Incorporation for Guided In Situ Spleen Tissue Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spleen's complex structure limits its regenerative capacity after injury, significantly impacting patient quality of life. This work develops an inducible scaffold mimicking spleen parenchyma, enhancing in situ regeneration. This scaffold reduces oxidative stress, recruits cells, and promotes tissue integration, while proteomics reveal activation of key metabolic pathways, enhancing splenic function and blood vessel regeneration.








Abstract
The spleen's complex structure and limited regenerative ability hinder its regrowth at the site of injure, affecting patient quality of life and risk severe complications. The spleen's stroma primarily consists of reticular and fibrillar collagen, supporting its microvascular network. Inspired by such biophysical environment, this work develops an inducible scaffold featuring an interpenetrating network structure of fibrous and reticular collagen, which is loaded with vascular endothelial cell membranes to facilitate in situ regeneration. The regenerated parenchyma includes red pulp, white pulp, and a vascular system. The scaffold effectively reduces oxidative stress at the injury site, recruits cells to degrade the scaffold, and promotes tissue integration, thereby accelerating spleen regeneration. Additionally, the regenerated tissue compensates for the spleen's functions, enhancing its ability to clear abnormal red blood cells and platelets. Proteomics and RNA sequencing analyses reveal that the scaffold induced the upregulation of key pathways, including the Wnt signalling pathway, Statin pathway, and amino acid metabolism pathway. This activation mobilizes splenic cells metabolism, enhances immune cell activity, and facilitates the remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Moreover, the incorporated cell membrane components promote splenic blood vessels regeneration by upregulating the neural crest cell differentiation pathway within the tissue.

         <dc:description>
A ZVO/RuO2 cathode is designed by coupling Zn0.85V10O24&#183;7.4H2O (ZVO) and RuO2 through interfacial V&#9472;O&#9472;Ru bonds in which a dynamic reversible breakage and reconstruction of V&#9472;O&#9472;Ru, which provide a reversible electron transfer channel between RuO2 and ZVO, making RuO2 as an additional electron acceptor and donor, accelerating the migration kinetics of H+/Zn2+ in ZVO.








Abstract
Intercalation&#8208;type layered vanadium oxides have been widely explored as cathode materials for aqueous zinc&#8211;ion batteries (AZIBs). However, attaining both high power density and superior stability remains a formidable challenge. Herein, layered vanadium oxides are pre&#8208;intercalated with Zn2+ to form Zn0.85V10O24&#183;7.4H2O (ZVO), which is then combined with RuO2 nanoparticles to construct a ZVO/RuO2 heterostructure featuring interphase V&#9472;O&#9472;Ru bonds. ZVO/RuO2 heterostructure exhibits a dynamic stable coupling at the interphase via V&#9472;O&#9472;Ru chemical bonds reconstruction during discharging/charging processes. The dynamically reversible reconstruction of interphase V&#9472;O&#9472;Ru bonds provides a fast electron transfer channel between RuO2 and ZVO cathode, as demonstrated by ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, making RuO2 an additional electron acceptor and donor, and accelerating the migration of H+/Zn2+ in layered ZVO cathode. Therefore, an ultra&#8208;high capacity (411 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1, 225 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20 A g&#8722;1) and long cycling stability (a retention of 92.2% at 20 A g&#8722;1 over 20000 cycles) performances are achieved. This interphase reversible reconstruction route provides a promising approach to achieving excellent cycling stability in cathode materials.

         <title>A Microphase Separation&#8208;Driven Supramolecular Tissue Adhesive with Instantaneous Dry/Wet Adhesion, Alcohol&#8208;Triggered Debonding, and Antibacterial Hemostasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microphase separation&#8208;driven supramolecular tissue adhesive based on guanidinium&#8208;functionalized polydimethylsiloxane exhibits instantaneous adhesion in both dry and wet environments. In the meantime, this material demonstrates the capacity for antibacterial hemostasis upon application to biological tissues and can be readily removed from tissue surfaces through wet wiping with medical&#8208;grade alcohol.








Abstract
Tissue adhesives are promising materials for expeditious hemorrhage control, while it remains a grand challenge to engineer a superior formulation with instantaneous adhesion, on&#8208;demand debonding, and the integration of multiple desirable properties such as antibacterial and hemostatic capabilities. Herein, a multifunctional supramolecular tissue adhesive based on guanidinium&#8208;modified polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is introduced, driven by a reversible microphase separation mechanism. By optimizing the content of guanidinium ions, precise control over cohesive strength, adhesion, and wettability is achieved, resulting in strong instantaneous adhesion under both dry and wet conditions. Notably, the supramolecular nature of the adhesive allows for convenient on&#8208;demand removal using medical&#8208;grade alcohol, offering a critical advantage for easy debonding. Additionally, the adhesive exhibits remarkable antimicrobial properties while maintaining excellent biocompatibility and hemocompatibility. Its underwater injectability supports minimally invasive surgical procedures. Furthermore, the adhesive's ability to incorporate solid particles enhances its versatility, particularly for the development of drug&#8208;embedded bioadhesives. This work addresses key challenges in tissue adhesive design via a microphase separation&#8208;driven working principle, thereby opening promising new avenues for the development of advanced bioadhesives with tailored properties and enhanced surgical and wound care outcomes.

         <title>Active Hydrogen Enrichment on Cu6Sn5&#8208;type High Entropy Intermetallics for Efficient Nitrate Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoporous (Cu0.25Ni0.25Fe0.25Co0.25)6Sn5 high entropy intermetallic compound achieves excellent performance for ammonia electrosynthesis, allowing electrocatalytic nitrate reduction in a wide concentration range, excellent stability, and direct production of ammonium product. The high intrinsic catalytic activity is attributed to improved H* generation, inhibited hydrogen evolution reaction, and low reaction free energy of the hydrogenation process.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) provides a feasible strategy for green ammonia production and the treatment of nitrate pollution in wastewater. The generation of active hydrogen (H*) plays an important role in improving the selectivity, yield rate, and Faradaic efficiency of ammonia products. Here, structurally ordered nanoporous Cu6Sn5&#8208;type high entropy intermetallics (HEI) with extremely superior performance toward NO3RR is demonstrated. The optimal nanoporous (Cu0.25Ni0.25Fe0.25Co0.25)6Sn5 HEI delivers a high NH3 Faradaic efficiency of 97.09 &#177; 1.15% and excellent stability of 120 h at the industrial level current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2, accordingly directly converting NO3&#8210; to high&#8208;purity (NH4)2HPO4 with near&#8208;unity efficiency. Theoretical calculations combined with experimental results reveal that the ordered multi&#8208;site nature of the nanoporous HEI can simultaneously promote water dissociation, reduce the reaction&#8208;free energy of the hydrogenation process, and suppress hydrogen evolution. This work provides the design of the precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free HEI for sustainable NH3 synthesis and paves insights into the H* enrichment mechanism.

         <title>A Durable and Highly Active Oxygen Electrode for Solid Oxide Cells: New Insight into Segregation Suppression of Layered Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High entropy oxides (HEOs) have attracted significant attention in the field of Solid oxide cells (SOCs) owing to their outstanding advantages. However, there is a lack of studies on mechanism through which entropy increases in HEO oxygen electrodes affects segregation suppression. Based on PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948; (PBSCF), a novel (La0.25Pr0.25Nd0.25Sm0.25)Ba0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948; (LPNSBSCF) oxygen electrode is designed and fabricated in this work to claim the mechanism of entropy&#8208;enhanced in layered perovskite.








Abstract
One challenge to realize the commercialization of solid oxide cell technology is the instability and poor catalytic activity of the oxygen electrode during stack operation caused by Cr&#8208;containing alloy interconnect. Particularly well&#8208;known Sr/Ba&#8208;containing perovskite oxides can easily segregate Sr/Ba to the surface, reacting with vaporized Cr and causing Cr poisoning. To address this challenge, this work designs an entropy&#8208;driven layered structural strategy to suppress the surface segregation of cations and realize substantial enhancement of catalysis activity and Cr tolerance. The investigations suggest that the planar strain generated by entropy increase in the rare earth layer plays a pivotal role in suppressing alkaline earth segregation. Consequently, the half&#8208;cells with (La0.25Pr0.25Nd0.25Sm0.25)Ba0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948; (LPNSBSCF) oxygen electrode exhibit significantly improved stability in various operation conditions with Cr containment. Furthermore, LPNSBSCF shows the high power density of 2.12 W cm&#8722;2 at 800&#160;&#176;C and 1.41 W cm&#8722;2 at 650&#160;&#176;C in the single cells of oxygen ion and proton type, respectively. This paper provides new insights into segregation suppression in layered perovskite and offers theoretical guidance for the rational design of oxygen electrodes to achieve high Cr&#8208;tolerance and catalytic activity.

         <title>In Situ Engineering of Grain Boundary Phase toward Superior Thermoelectric Performance in Mg3(Sb,Bi)2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of grain boundary phases with low resistivity can effectively enhance the thermoelectric performance of Mg3(Sb,Bi)2. This work proposes an in situ engineering approach inducing TiO2&#8208;n to reduce interfacial barriers, which is attributed to the formation of Ti3Sb. These secondary phases significantly enhance the power factor while simultaneously reducing the lattice thermal conductivity, thereby resulting in a superior figure of merit (zT) and conversion efficiency.








Abstract
As a promising thermoelectric material for electronic cooling and power generation, Mg3(Sb,Bi)2 has received extensive attention. Despite efforts to enhance its performance through composite modulation, challenges such as secondary phase refinement, dispersion, and interfacial mismatch, particularly at grain boundaries, remain critical. In this work, by incorporating TiO2&#8208;n into the Mg3(Sb,Bi)2&#8208;based matrix, the grain boundary phases are in situ engineered, yielding a superior figure of merit (zT) exceeding 2 at 798 K. The electrical conductivity is significantly enhanced with only slight changes to the Seebeck coefficient over the entire temperature range, mainly due to the contribution to carrier concentration and mobility from the newly generated Ti3Sb at grain boundaries. Benefiting from the remarkably enhanced power factor and the diminished lattice thermal conductivity, the zT value shows an overall increase within the temperature range of 300&#8211;798 K, leading to a considerable conversion efficiency of 15% for the single&#8208;leg device.

         <title>Promoting Phase Transition in Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskites For High&#8208;Performance Pure&#8208;Red LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solution&#8208;processed quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films have a wide phase component distribution. Yu et&#160;al. show that introducing acetate anions promote the in situ phase transition from low&#8208;n to high&#8208;n phases. The enhanced phase transformation efficiency enables high&#8208;performance pure&#8208;red light&#8208;emitting diodes with an emission peak of 641 nm and peak external quantum efficiency of 25.3%.








Abstract
Layered quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;2D)&#160;halide perovskites have emerged as a promising platform for high&#8208;efficiency electroluminescence. Narrowing the multi&#8208;quantum well distribution and eliminating wide&#8208;bandgap 2D phases are crucial for achieving a flat energy landscape, minimizing energy loss, and ensuring high&#8208;color&#8208;purity emission. Here, it is demonstrated that solution&#8208;processed quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films with broad component distributions arise from an incomplete kinetic transition from low&#8208;n (n, quantum well thickness) to high&#8208;n phases. To address this, an acetate anion treatment strategy is proposed, which induces competitive coordination between the acetate anion, the bulky spacer cation, and the inorganic layer, thereby facilitating the insertion of octahedral precursor ions and promoting phase transition. This treatment results in quasi&#8208;2D films with enhanced color purity, efficient energy transfer, and high photoluminescence quantum yield. The fabricated perovskite light emitting diode&#160;(PeLED) exhibits an emission peak at 641&#160;nm and a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 25.3%, representing one of the most efficient pure&#8208;red PeLEDs. The strategy also showcases the versatility of quasi&#8208;2D films for different emission wavelengths.

The fabricated perovskite light emitting diode&#160;(PeLED) exhibits an emission peak at 641&#160;nm and a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 25.3%, representing one of the most efficient pure-red PeLEDs. The strategy also showcases the versatility of quasi-2D films for different emission wavelengths.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pairing N&#8208;Vacancy and Adjacent Ni&#8208;Sites in the Local Microenvironment to Regulate the Urea Oxidation Reaction Pathway With Enhanced Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In nitrogen vacancies&#8208;rich nickel nitride (Ni3N&#8208;VN), a local microenvironment of nitrogen vacancies and adjacent Ni sites is formed. The electron&#8208;rich Ni&#8208;sites can be converted to NiOOH at a lower potential, and urea adsorption on the electron&#8208;deficient nitrogen vacancy region is conducive to its partial dissociation, conceiving to efficient urea oxidation reaction.








Abstract
The urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is a promising approach for replacing the oxygen evolution reaction in hydrogen production, offering lower energy consumption. However, the kinetics of Ni&#8208;based catalysts for UOR are hindered by the high formation potential of NiOOH and its repeated transition with Ni(OH)2. In this study, a local microenvironment featuring electron&#8208;deficient N&#8208;vacancies (VN) paired with adjacent electron&#8208;rich Ni&#8208;sites on Ni3N (Ni3N&#8208;VN) to enhance UOR kinetics is constructed. The electron&#8208;rich Ni&#8208;sites significantly reduce the energy barrier for NiOOH formation and promote the conversion of Ni(OH)2 to NiOOH. Meanwhile, the VN sites induce low charge transfer resistance in Ni3N, facilitating efficient electron transfer and boosting UOR performance while ensuring the stability of the active NiOOH phase. The VN sites promote the adsorption of the urea N atom at the active site, favoring the reaction pathway toward &#8220;NCO&#8315;&#8221; formation without requiring complete urea dissociation. This pathway alleviates the NiOOH/Ni(OH)2 conversion cycle, lowers charge transfer resistance, and improves reaction kinetics. Ni3N&#8208;VN demonstrates excellent UOR activity (low potential of 1.46&#160;V at 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and industrial prospects (integrating into an anion exchange membrane flow electrolyzer with 20% Pt/C, producing 600&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.84&#160;V), highlighting its potential for practical applications.

         <title>Crosslinked Hetero&#8208;Chain Polymeric Interphase Enables the Stable Cycling of Li&#8208;Rich Mn&#8208;Based Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new kind of &#8220;crosslinked hetero&#8208;chain polymeric CEI&#8221; (CHP&#8208;CEI) is particularly tailored for LRMO cathode. This CHP&#8208;CEI is homogeneous and shows a balanced combination of high robustness, flexibility, and mechanical energy dissipation ability, which can not be achieved by conventional additives. Therefore, the cracking of LRMO cathode, gas release, and transition metal dissolution are largely mitigated during cycling at aggressive voltages.








Abstract
The lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based layered oxide (LRMO) cathode shows grar promise for high&#8208;energy density and environment&#8208;friendly batteries due to its cation and anion redox. However, it suffers from continuous electrolyte consumption and capacity decay, especially at high mass loadings (&gt;10 mg cm&#8722;2). Conventional electrolyte/interphase strategies fail to address the structural characteristics of LRMO, limiting its practical application. Here, we reveal the specific requirements for cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) of LRMO and accordingly design a non&#8208;fluorinated additive, 2,4,6&#8208;trivinyl&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylcyclotrisiloxane (TVTMS). TVTMS could form a crosslinked hetero&#8208;chain polymeric CEI (CHP&#8208;CEI) through ring&#8208;opening polymerization and ethylene group crosslinking, offering a unique balance of high robustness, flexibility, and mechanical energy dissipation, which could not be achieved by conventional additives. Therefore, the cracking of LRMO cathode, gas release and transition metal dissolution were effectively mitigated. It should be noted that, for the first time to our knowledge, we employed the single&#8208;particle aerosol mass spectrometry (SPAMS) to study CEI components, especially the organic/polymer species. The Li|LRMO cells based on CHP&#8208;CEI display a lifespan &gt;825 cycles with remained capacity of 204 mAh g&#8722;1 and the cells with high&#8208;loading cathode (12 mg cm&#8722;2) achieve stable cycling &gt;145 cycles with 80% capacity retention, which surpasses the performance of previously reported electrolytes.

This perspective critically examines HE approaches in SEs, highlighting how compositional complexity induces system disorder and local&#8208;structure evolution to enhance stability and properties. While HE concepts are attractive, establishing rigorous structure&#8208;property relationships requires further investigation. The discussion aims to guide future research in this promising field by clarifying key challenges and opportunities in HE&#8208;based electrolyte design.








Abstract
As the key material for the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), solid electrolytes (SEs) have attracted increasing attention. Recently, a novel design strategy&#8722;high&#8208;entropy (HE) approach is frequently reported to improve the ionic conductivity and electrochemical performance of SEs. However, the fundamental understandings on the HE working mechanism and applicability evaluation of HE concept are deficient, which would impede the sustainable development of a desirable strategy to enable high&#8208;performance SEs. In this contribution, the essence of HE&#8208;related approaches and their positive effects on SEs are evaluated. The reported HE strategy stems from complex compositional regulations. The derived structural stability and enhanced property are originally from the modulated system disorder and subtle local&#8208;structure evolutions, respectively. While HE ardently describes the increased entropy/disorder during the modification of prevailing SEs, rigorous experimental formulations, and direct correlations between the HE structures and desired properties are necessary to be established. This perspective would be a timely and critical overview for the HE approaches in the context of SEs, aiming to stimulate further discussion and exploration in this emerging research direction.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide chemistry is an emerging approach in promoting the kinetics of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;S batteries (ASSLSBs). In this perspective, the distinct roles of halide chemistry are discussed at both the cathode and anode, analyzing the atomic arrangement, phase composition, and morphology evolution in various halogenation strategies. further research and broad discussion of halogenation strategies are expected to inspire ASSLSBs.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;S batteries (ASSLSBs) are emerging as a promising energy storage solution due to their low cost and high energy density. Their solid&#8208;state configuration effectively eliminates the notorious shuttle effect caused by soluble polysulfides in conventional liquid electrolytes. However, the heterogeneous solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid interfaces introduce significant challenges, including sluggish ion/electron transport and interfacial instability among electrode materials, conductive additives, and solid electrolytes (SEs). Recently, halide&#8208;based strategies have gained attention for enabling high&#8208;performance ASSLSBs. This perspective highlights these strategies, emphasizing the role of halide chemistry in enhancing ASSLSB kinetics. It is contended that halides (e.g., iodides) in sulfur&#8208;based cathode composites&#8212;such as Li2S and transition metal sulfides&#8212;can activate S/Li2S redox reactions, improving both ionic and electronic conductivities. This &#8220;catalytic effect&#8221; of halides accelerates the reversible transition, even in the absence of conductive additives like SEs or conductive carbons. Moreover, halides at the anode interface play a crucial role in preventing Li dendrite formation and SE degradation, owing to their large polarizability and high interfacial energy. This perspective provides a timely and insightful summary of halide chemistry's impact on ASSLSB kinetics, offering inspiration for further research and broader adoption of halide&#8208;based strategies in next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;S batteries.

Pressure Sensors
The cover image illustrates how side&#8208;chain&#8208;doped polymers undergo molecular rearrangement and charge&#8208;density perturbation under pressure. This pressure&#8208;induced phenomenon enhances carrier lifetime, leading to improved electrical conductivity in the material. The sensor is further integrated with convolutional neural networks to create an intelligent vocal recognition system, achieving over 96% classification accuracy across diverse vocal profiles. More details can be found in article number 2500077 by Jian Song, Hui Li, Jianhua Zhang, Charles H. Lawrie, and co&#8208;workers.

Silicon Sulfide Solid&#8208;State Batteries
This cover illustrates a &#8805; 400Wh kg&#8722;1 silicon solid&#8208;state battery featuring a micro&#8208;Si anode, thin sulfide electrolyte, and a thick LNO&#8208;coated NMC cathode. While a robust solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase enables long&#8208;term cycling at the anode, CEI degradation mechanisms at the cathode are identified, offering critical insights into interfacial engineering for next&#8208;generation batteries. More details can be found in article number 2502300 by Guang Yang and co&#8208;workers.

Photoimmunotherapy
In article number 2501184, Yuqi Tang, Dan Xiang, and Quan Li report a novel near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) J&#8208;aggregate&#8208;based nanomedicine, leveraging an in situ secondary self&#8208;assembly strategy to fabricate highly targeted nanoparticles. These nanomedicines trigger pyroptosis by generating type I reactive oxygen species, while simultaneously activating photoimmunotherapy. This unique structural transformation enhances the nanomedicine accumulation in tumor tissues, enabling robust NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging and improving therapeutic efficacy even in hypoxic tumor microenvironments.

Friction Behavior of Hydrogels
In article number 2417177, Kai Zhang, Jiuling Wang, and co&#8208;workers reveal that water evaporation from hydrogel surfaces in open&#8208;air conditions reduces the hydrodynamic layer thickness and increases surface viscosity, leading to a gradual rise in friction. Optimizing pore size and water mobility within the hydrogel enhances water transport from the interior to the surface, mitigating evaporation and enabling consistently low friction. This work provides guidelines for designing hydrogel materials with excellent lubrication properties.

Sprayable Hydrogel
This study designs a sprayable hydrogel based on polypeptide&#8208;modified lipid nanoparticles (PLNs) to treat non&#8208;compressible hemorrhage. Functionalized with GFOGER and GGQQLK peptides, PLNs synergistically mimic natural hemostasis via platelet adherence and aggregation, Ca2+/DSPS&#8208;mediated prothrombin activation and fibrin network stabilization. The biomimetic system enables rapid clot formation by sequential coordinating primary hemostasis, coagulation amplification and fibrin reinforcement. More details can be found in article number 2500908 by Yang Li, Chenhui Zhu, Daidi Fan, and co&#8208;workers.

Multimodal Humidity Adaptive Optical Neuron
In article number 2417793 by Nazek El&#8208;Atab and co&#8208;workers, a multifunctional memristor is demonstrated for in&#8208;memory sensing and computing, leveraging a MoWS2/VOx heterojunction to enable high ON/OFF ratio up to 108 with ultralow operating voltages of &#177;0.2 V. This bio&#8208;inspired multimodal design exhibits tunable synaptic behavior across electrical, optical, and humidity stimuli, enabling in&#8208;situ modulation of conductance for low&#8208;power, real&#8208;time processing of multisensory signals. The reconfigurable humidity&#8208;adaptive neuron and humidity&#8208;mediated optical synaptic learning enable vision clarity control, paving the way for energy&#8208;efficient next&#8208;generation human&#8211;machine interfaces.

         <title>Recent Advances in Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Materials and Soft Robotic Actuators for Bioelectronic Medicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the integration of responsive materials and soft robotic actuators with implantable electronics to address key challenges in bioelectronic medicine. By enabling shape actuation, these technologies improve deployment, adaptability, and accuracy in minimally invasive procedures. The review discusses actuation mechanisms, device designs, and future opportunities for intelligent, responsive implants with enhanced therapeutic and diagnostic capabilities.








Abstract
Bioelectronic medicine uses implantable electronic devices to interface with electrically active tissues and transform the way disease is diagnosed and treated. One of the biggest challenges is the development of minimally invasive devices that can be deployed to patients at scale. Responsive materials and soft robotic actuators offer unique opportunities to make bioelectronic devices with shape actuation, promising to address the limitations of existing rigid and passive systems, including difficult deployment, mechanical mismatch with soft tissues, and limited adaptability in minimally invasive settings. In this review, an overview is provided of smart materials and soft robotic technologies that show promises for implantable use, discussing advantages and limitations of underlying actuation mechanisms. Examples are then presented where soft actuating mechanisms are combined with microelectrodes to create shape actuating bioelectronic devices. Opportunities and challenges for next&#8208;generation intelligent bioelectronic devices assisted by responsive materials and soft robotic actuators are then discussed. These innovations may allow electronic implants to safely navigate to target areas inside the body and establish large area and spatiotemporally controlled interfaces for diagnostic or therapeutic procedures that are minimally invasive.

         <title>Engineering Magnetotactic Bacteria as Medical Microrobots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) are living microorganisms that produce magnetosomes for navigation using the Earth's geomagnetic field. Their built&#8208;in magnetic components, along with their intrinsic and/or modified biological functions, make them one of the most promising platforms for making future living and programmable microrobots. This review highlights recent advances in MTB&#8208;based microrobotics, detailing their interactions with magnetic fields, propulsion mechanisms, motion control, and emerging strategies for engineering and functionalizing MTB for biomedical applications.








Abstract
Nature's ability to create complex and functionalized organisms has long inspired engineers and scientists to develop increasingly advanced machines. Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB), a group of Gram&#8208;negative prokaryotes that biomineralize iron and thrive in aquatic environments, have garnered significant attention from the bioengineering community. These bacteria possess chains of magnetic nanocrystals known as magnetosomes, which allow them to align with Earth's geomagnetic field and navigate through aquatic environments via magnetotaxis, enabling localization to areas rich in nutrients and optimal oxygen concentration. Their built&#8208;in magnetic components, along with their intrinsic and/or modified biological functions, make them one of the most promising platforms for future medical microrobots. Leveraging an externally applied magnetic field, the motion of MTBs can be precisely controlled, rendering them suitable for use as a new type of biohybrid microrobotics with great promise in medicine for bioimaging, drug delivery, cancer therapy, antimicrobial treatment, and detoxification. This mini&#8208;review provides an up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview of recent advancements in MTB microrobots, delineates the interaction between MTB microrobots and magnetic fields, elucidates propulsion mechanisms and motion control, and reports state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies for modifying and functionalizing MTB for medical applications.

The common thermoplastic and carbon fiber applied in the manufacture of carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics are summarized, and the processing and postprocessing methods are reviewed, with emphasis on state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art welding techniques. The typical applications of carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics in industry are also highlighted.








Abstract
Carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics (CFRTs) have witnessed a resurgence in recent times since their first industrial use over five decades ago, with revitalized interest from aerospace companies and other key sectors including energy and automotive sectors. CFRTs are increasingly gaining footholds in high volume rapid manufacturing in aerospace and nonaerospace sectors owing to their inherent recyclability. However, there has been a lack of contemporary and critical review on this topic so far. This work aims to review the recent advances in CFRTs with emphasis on high performance thermoplastics. Both continuous and discontinuous fiber forms in tape, organosheet and short/long fiber architectures are discussed, their processing and postprocessing methods are reviewed, with emphasis on state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art welding techniques. Typical applications of CFRTs in industry are examined, including fuselage, pressure vessel, and automotive components. Finally, insights are provided into ongoing challenges, future development, and a roadmap for expediting the development of high&#8208;performance CFRTs.

         <title>Materials Advances in Devices for Heart Disease Interventions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>

This review examines the crucial role of materials in heart disease interventions, focusing on strategies for monitoring, managing, and repairing heart conditions. It discusses the material requirements for medical devices, highlighting recent innovations and their impact on cardiovascular health. It aims to provide insights into the challenges in cardiovascular interventions and the essential role of materials in developing effective solutions.








Abstract
Heart disease encompasses a range of conditions that affect the heart, including coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, congenital heart defects, heart valve disease, and conditions that affect the heart muscle. Intervention strategies can be categorized according to when they are administered and include: 1) Monitoring cardiac function using sensor technology to inform diagnosis and treatment, 2) Managing symptoms by restoring cardiac output, electrophysiology, and hemodynamics, and often serving as bridge&#8208;to&#8208;recovery or bridge&#8208;to&#8208;transplantation strategies, and 3) Repairing damaged tissue, including myocardium and heart valves, when management strategies are insufficient. Each intervention approach and technology require specific material properties to function optimally, relying on materials that support their action and interface with the body, with new technologies increasingly depending on advances in materials science and engineering. This review explores material properties and requirements driving innovation in advanced intervention strategies for heart disease and highlights key examples of recent progress in the field driven by advances in materials research.

         <title>Deactivation Mechanism and Mitigation Strategies of Single&#8208;Atom Site Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in the single&#8208;atom site electrocatalysts (SACs) stability/durability, encompassing both deactivation mechanism at the atomic&#8208;, meso&#8208;, and nanoscale, and mitigation strategies by controlling the catalyst composition, structure, morphology and surface. Moreover, the challenges and prospects of efficient SACs for long&#8208;term use are proposed. This review can provide a unique perspective as well as rational guidelines, with emphasis on stability/durability issues, for future large&#8208;scale applications of SACs and beyond.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom site electrocatalysts (SACs), with maximum atom efficiency, fine&#8208;tuned coordination structure, and exceptional reactivity toward catalysis, energy, and environmental purification, have become the emerging frontier in recent decade. Along with significant breakthroughs in activity and selectivity, the limited stability and durability of SACs are often underemphasized, posing a grand challenge in meeting the practical requirements. One pivotal obstacle to the construction of highly stable SACs is the heavy reliance on empirical rather than rational design methods. A comprehensive review is urgently needed to offer a concise overview of the recent progress in SACs stability/durability, encompassing both deactivation mechanism and mitigation strategies. Herein, this review first critically summarizes the SACs degradation mechanism and induction factors at the atomic&#8208;, meso&#8208; and nanoscale, mainly based on but not limited to oxygen reduction reaction. Subsequently, potential stability/durability improvement strategies by tuning catalyst composition, structure, morphology and surface are delineated, including construction of robust substrate and metal&#8208;support interaction, optimization of active site stability, fabrication of porosity and surface modification. Finally, the challenges and prospects for robust SACs are discussed. This review facilitates the fundamental understanding of catalyst degradation mechanism and provides efficient design principles aimed at overcoming deactivation difficulties for SACs and beyond.

         <title>Wearable Photonic Device for Multiple Biomarker Sampling and Detection without Blood Draws</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wearable photonic device (PiED) is developed by integrating a microlens array (MLA) and an optic microneedle array (OMNA) functionalized with immunobinding for safe and needle&#8208;free biomarker sampling and multiple blood biomarker detection without blood draw. The MLA&#8208;integrated OMNA amplifies and transmits LED light at 595 nm into skin, evenly distributing it in the capillary&#8208;enriched dermis and inducing biomarker extravasation.








Abstract
Needle&#8208;based blood draws or phlebotomy practice in clinics for centuries, often causing pain, discomfort, and inconvenience. Here, a wearable photonic device is presented by integrating a microlens array (MLA) and an optic microneedle array (OMNA) functionalized with immunobinding for safe and needle&#8208;free biomarker sampling and detection. The MLA&#8208;integrated OMNA amplifies and transmits LED light at 595&#160;nm into skin through the OMNA, bypassing the light&#8208;absorbing melanin in the epidermal layer, and evenly distributing it in the capillary&#8208;enriched dermis independent of the skin colors. The 595&#160;nm light is absorbed by hemoglobin (Hb) and oxygen&#8208;Hb within the capillaries, triggering thermal dilation of capillaries without damaging them or causing petechiae. The light illumination remarkably increases in the concentrations of various blood biomarkers in the skin through biomarker extravasation. These biomarkers bound specifically to the capture antibodies on&#160;OMNA with each microneedle covalently immobilized with one specific antibody. The OMNA is extensively modified to amplify the immunobinding signals and achieve sensitivity superior to that of enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. As proof of concept, the functionality of the prototype for minimally invasive sampling and precise multiplexed blood biomarker detection in two mouse models is validated to quantify acute inflammation and specific antibody production.

         <title>Radical p&#8208;Doping Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD for Efficient, Stable and Self&#8208;Healing Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;healing nitroxide redical, DT&#8208;TEMPO, has been used to address slow oxidation and mechanical stability limitations of Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD in perovskite solar cells, achieving good power conversion efficiency of 25.69% (rigid, certified 25.30%), 21.23% (rigid mini&#8208;module), and 24.19% (flexible). Most impressively, the flexible devices with DT&#8208;TEMPO show remarkable machnical stability, maintaining &#8764;95% of initial efficiency after 20&#8201;000 bending cycles through a dynamic disulfide bond cleavage and reformation mechanism.








Abstract
Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD is the primary hole transport material (HTM) for high&#8208;efficiency and stable flexible perovskite solar cells (FPSCs). However, the slow oxidation rate and susceptibility to film cracking under stress in Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD lead to reduced device stability and efficiency. In this paper, a multi&#8208;functional novel self&#8208;healing nitroxide radical monomer, 4&#8208;[[5&#8208;(1,2&#8208;dithiolane&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1&#8208;oxopentyl]amino]&#8208;2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl (DT&#8208;TEMPO), has been introduced to address these challenges. DT&#8208;TEMPO, on one side, enhances the hole mobility and conductivity by p&#8208;doping Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, while boosting the charge transfer process from perovskite to Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD with an optimized energy level alignment on the other side. Additionally, DT&#8208;TEMPO endows a self&#8208;healing capability to Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD through the introduction of dynamic breaking and reconstructing disulfide bond. The optimized perovskite solar cells achieve impressive power conversion efficiencies, 25.69% on rigid substrates (certified 25.30%), 21.23% on rigid mini&#8208;modules, and 24.19% on flexible substrates. Remarkably, the FPSCs with DT&#8208;TEMPO retain over 90% of their initial efficiency even after 20&#8201;000 bending cycles (r = 6&#160;mm) and recover to &#8776;95% of their initial value through the self&#8208;healing process.

Abstract
Transition metal sulfur oxides have emerged as promising candidates for advanced energy storage due to their multi&#8208;electron redox activity and tunable nanostructures. Among them, Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;O&#8208;S composites are particularly attractive for supercapacitors owing to their high energy storage density. However, conventional synthesis methods often require prolonged processing times (&gt;10&#160;h) or high&#8208;temperature treatments (&gt;80&#160;&#176;C), which limit their practical applications. This work addresses these challenges by developing amorphous&#8208;nanocrystalline intertwined Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;O&#8208;S nanohybrid nanosheet arrays through a rapid alternating current (AC) electrodeposition method (1&#160;h) under ambient conditions. The unique architecture combines the advantages of amorphous phases (enhanced ion diffusion pathways) and nanocrystalline domains (efficient charge transport), leading to exceptional specific capacitance of 4804&#160;F&#160;g&#8315;&#185; (or 959&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, 2402&#160;C&#160;g&#8722;1) at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8315;&#185;, 82.2% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles (5&#160;A&#160;g&#8315;&#185;), and a near 100% Coulombic efficiency (CE). The assembled asymmetric supercapacitor achieves an energy density of 199.4&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8315;&#185; at 754&#160;W&#160;kg&#8315;&#185;, bridging the performance gap between batteries and conventional capacitors.

         <title>A Multimodal Humidity Adaptive Optical Neuron Based on a MoWS2/VOx Heterojunction for Vision and Respiratory Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional memristor is demonstrated for in&#8208;memory sensing and computing, leveraging a MoWS&#8322;/VOx heterojunction to enable high ON/OFF ratio up to 10&#8312; with ultralow operating voltages of &#177;0.2&#160;V. This bio&#8208;inspired multimodal design exhibits tunable synaptic behavior across electrical, optical, and humidity stimuli, enabling in situ modulation of conductance for low&#8208;power, real&#8208;time processing of multisensory signals. The reconfigurable humidity&#8208;adaptive neuron and humidity&#8208;mediated optical synaptic learning enable non&#8208;contact respiratory sensing and vision clarity control, paving the way for energy&#8208;efficient next&#8208;generation human&#8211;machine interfaces.








Abstract
Advancements in computing have progressed from near&#8208;sensor to in&#8208;sensor computing, culminating in the development of multimodal in&#8208;memory computing, which enables faster, energy&#8208;efficient data processing by performing computations directly within the memory devices. A bio&#8208;inspired multimodal in&#8208;memory computing system capable of performing real&#8208;time low power processing of multisensory signals, lowering data conversion and transmission across several modules in conventional chips is introduced. A novel Cu/MoWS2/VOx/Pt based multimodal memristor is characterized by an ON/OFF ratio as high as 108 with consistent and ultralow operating voltages of &#177;0.2 surpassing conventional single&#8208;mode memory functions. Apart from observing electrical synaptic behavior, photonic depression and humidity mediated optical synaptic learning is also demonstrated. The heterojunction with MoWS2 also enables reconfigurable modulation in both memory and optical synaptic functionalities with changing humidity. This behavior provides tunable conductance modulation capabilities emulating synaptic transmission in biological neurons while showing potential in respiratory detection module for healthcare application. The humidity sensing capability is implemented to demonstrate vision clarity using a convolutional neural network (CNN), with different humidity levels applied as a data augmentation preprocessing method. This proposed multimodal functionality represents a novel platform for developing artificial sensory neurons, with significant implications for non&#8208;contact human&#8211;computer interaction in intelligent systems.

         <title>Legumain In Situ Engineering Promotes Efferocytosis of CAR Macrophage to Treat Cardiac Fibrosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this research article, the authors found that the overwhelming apoptotic cells after myocardial infarction (MI) result in an overburdened efferocytosis in CAR&#8208;M&#934;, which compromises their antifibrotic potency. To address this challenge, an in situ engineered legumain (Lgmn) is developed to elevate the cargo degradation of phagolysosome for promoting the efferocytosis of CAR&#8208;M&#934;s, restoring their antifibrotic capability.








Abstract
Uncontrolled and excessive cardiac fibrosis after myocardial infarction (MI) is a primary contributor to mortality by heart failure. Chimeric antigen receptor macrophage (CAR&#8208;M&#934;) therapy shows great promise in cardiac fibrosis, however, the overwhelming apoptotic cells after MI results in an overburdened efferocytosis in CAR&#8208;M&#934;, which compromises their antifibrotic potency. This work here reports an in situ engineered legumain (Lgmn) to elevate the cargo degradation of phagolysosome for promoting the efferocytosis of CAR&#8208;M&#934;s, restoring their antifibrotic capability. Specifically, with the in&#8208;house customized macrophages&#8208;targeting lipid nanoparticles, this work first creates an efferocytosis&#8208;boosted fibrosis&#8208;specific CAR&#8208;M&#934;s by introducing dual mRNAs that encode Lgmn, an endolysosomal cysteine protease, along with an anti&#8208;fibroblast activation protein (FAP) CAR, respectively. This data demonstrate these CAR&#8208;M&#934;s displayed a significantly increased phagocytic capacity as well as improved efferocytosis and enhanced antifibrotic capability. Treatment with the in situ reprogrammed CAR&#8208;M&#934;s in MI mice obviously reduced the infarct size and mitigated cardiac fibrosis, leading to significant restoration of cardiac function. In sum, these findings establish that promoting efferocytosis through Lgmn engineering effectively relieved the overburdened efferocytosis of CAR&#8208;M&#934;s, and enhanced their treatment efficacy of cardiac fibrosis with broad application in other fibrotic diseases.

This data demonstrate these CAR-M&#934;s displayed a significantly increased phagocytic capacity as well as improved efferocytosis and enhanced antifibrotic capability. Treatment with the in situ reprogrammed CAR-M&#934;s in MI mice obviously reduced the infarct size and mitigated cardiac fibrosis, leading to significant restoration of cardiac function. In sum, these findings establish that promoting efferocytosis through Lgmn engineering effectively relieved the overburdened efferocytosis of CAR-M&#934;s, and enhanced their treatment efficacy of cardiac fibrosis with broad application in other fibrotic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Observation of Conductive Interstitial Ga Line Defects in &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using near&#8208;field infrared and atomic&#8208;resolution transmission electron imaging, a novel phenomenon is observed: the presence of conductive interstitial Ga line defects within &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 nanoflakes. These defects lead to an associated increase in conductivity, which in turn results in a broadband infrared response and the quenching of cathodoluminescence. Functioning as an antenna, these defects can excite phonon polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride cladding layers, offering exciting prospects for applications in nanophotonic devices.








Abstract
Beta&#8208;phase gallium sesquioxide (&#946;&#8208;Ga2O3), possessing an ultrawide bandgap and high breakdown voltage, exhibits strong potential for deep&#8208;ultraviolet photodetection and high&#8208;power electronics. However, nanometer&#8208;scale line defects, prevalent in &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 growth, degrade device performance by increasing leakage currents and reducing breakdown voltages, thus termed &#8220;killer defects&#8221;. Critically, the impact of these defects at the atomic scale remains unclear due to limited characterization and a lack of detailed understanding. Here, the observation of novel conductive atomic line defects is reported within &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 nanoflakes using near&#8208;field infrared imaging. Combining atomic&#8208;resolution imaging with density functional theory calculations, these defects are identified as interstitial Ga atoms migrating along the c&#8208;axis. These atomic line defects exhibit a broadband infrared response and quenched cathodoluminescence, indicative of significantly enhanced local conductivity. This elevated conductivity enables subsurface near&#8208;field detection of the defects and remote excitation of phonon polaritons in a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) capping layer. These findings underscore the distinct conductivity of atomic&#8208;scale line defects, emphasizing the need for their controlled management during material synthesis and device fabrication, while simultaneously suggesting opportunities for their exploitation in nanophotonic applications.

         <title>Hybrid Lipoplex Boosts Neuron&#8208;Microglia Crosstalk for Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease through A&#946;&#8208;Targeted&#8208;Autophagy and ApoE2 Gene Supplementation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid lipoplex (RMC/pApoE2) composed of guanidine&#8208;rich lipids (metformin&#8208;inspired MLS and arginine&#8208;contained RLS), oleic acid&#8208;modified cerium dioxide (OA@CeO2), and pApoE2 restores neuron&#8208;microglia crosstalk to eliminate A&#946; deposits from temporal and spatial multidimensions. It induces neuronal and microglial autophagy at the upstream and downstream of A&#946; metabolism, along with enhanced pApoE2 transfection for intra&#8208; and extra&#8208;cellular elimination of A&#946; aggregates.








Abstract
Efficient clearance of amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) is vital but challenging in Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment due to its complicated regulation mechanisms during generation and metabolism. It necessitates a multidimensional synergistic strategy based on ingenious delivery system design. Herein, guanidine&#8208;rich lipids (metformin&#8208;inspired MLS and arginine&#8208;contained RLS) are devised to trigger selective chaperone&#8208;mediated autophagy for amyloid precursor protein degradation in neurons. They are further co&#8208;assembled with oleic acid&#8208;modified cerium dioxide (OA@CeO2) to form RMC assembly for pApoE2 delivery (RMC/pApoE2 lipoplex). The OA@CeO2 boosts macro&#8208;autophagy, alleviates oxidative stress and inflammatory microenvironment, and promotes the neurons&#8208;microglia crosstalk for A&#946; elimination. Concurrently, both guanidine&#8208;rich lipids and OA@CeO2 benefit pApoE2 transfection in neurons, enabling the transport of A&#946; into microglia, and facilitating enzymatic hydrolysis and cellular digestion of extracellular A&#946;. The lipoplex&#8208;boosted neuron&#8211;microglia interactions ultimately eliminate both intra&#8208; and extra&#8208;cellular A&#946; aggregates. Consequently, the RMC/pApoE2 lipoplex eliminates &#8776;86.9% of A&#946; plaques in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice and restored the synaptic function and neuronal connectivity. Moreover, it recovers the spatial memory of APP/PS1 mice to nearly the level of WT control. The presented hybrid lipoplex showcases an advanced gene delivery system, and offers a promising strategy for A&#946; clearance in AD treatment.

         <title>Phosphatidylcholine Liposome Accelerated Platinum Nanomachines (PLANEs) With Enhanced Penetration Capability for Thrombus Mechanotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a phosphatidylcholine (PC) liposome coating strategy for nanomotors. The isotropic and lubricating PC liposome enhances the linear motion and reduces friction of platinum nanomotors, improving their performance in complex physiological environments. Besides enabling non&#8208;pharmacological thrombolysis, this approach can refine nanomotor delivery systems and boost drug therapy effectiveness.








Abstract
Thrombotic cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of mortality worldwide. However, current thrombolytic therapeutics suffer from limited efficacy and a high risk of severe bleeding. Here, a phosphatidylcholine liposome accelerated platinum nanomachine (PLANE) for thrombus mechanotherapy is designed, constructed by encapsulating platinum nanomotors within isotropic, lubricating phosphatidylcholine (PC) liposomes. The precisely engineered PLANE exhibits superior lubricity and linear motion. Under laser irradiation and hydrogen peroxide treatment, PLANEs achieve significantly higher velocities than conventional platinum nanomotors, facilitating deep penetration into the thrombi. Further functionalization with thrombus&#8208;targeting peptides enables the cPLANEs to selectively accumulate at the thrombotic sites in vivo, demonstrating excellent thrombolytic efficacy. This work presents a novel surface modification strategy for optimizing the motion behavior of platinum nanomotors, offering a promising non&#8208;pharmaceutic approach for thrombotic disease treatment.

         <title>Enhanced Polariton Interactions in Suspended WS2 Monolayer Microcavity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolayers of transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides exhibit strong exciton resonances for light&#8208;matter interactions at RT, though substrate effects limit performance. This work presents a planar microcavity with a suspended WS2 monolayer, eliminating substrate&#8208;induced losses. The system shows enhancement of strong coupling and preserves the spin&#8208;dependent polaritonic interactions, achieving a record exciton interaction constant close to theoretical predictions. This approach reveals the intrinsic optical and spintronic properties of 2D materials, paving the way for advanced polaritonic.








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides monolayers exhibit strong exciton resonances that enable intense light&#8208;matter interactions. The sensitivity of these materials to the surrounding environment and their interactions with the substrate result in the enhancement of excitonic losses through scattering, dissociation and defects formation, hindering their full potential for the excitation of optical nonlinearities in exciton&#8208;polariton platforms. The use of suspended monolayers holds the potential to completely eliminate substrate&#8208;induced losses, offering unique advantages for the exploitation of intrinsic electronic, mechanical, and optical properties of 2D materials&#8208;based polaritonic systems, without any influence of proximity effects. In this work, we report a novel fabrication approach enabling the realization of a planar microcavity filled with a suspended tungsten disulfide (WS2) monolayer in its center. We experimentally demonstrate a 2&#8208;fold enhancement of the strong coupling at room temperature, due to the larger exciton binding energy and reduced overall losses as compared to similar systems based on dielectric&#8208;filled microcavities. As a result, spin&#8208;dependent polaritonic interactions are significantly amplified, leading to achievement of a record exciton interaction constant approaching the theoretically predicted value. This approach holds promises for pushing 2D materials&#8208;based polaritonic systems to their intrinsic limits, paving the way for the realization of novel polaritonic devices with superior performance.

This approach holds promises for pushing 2D materials-based polaritonic systems to their intrinsic limits, paving the way for the realization of novel polaritonic devices with superior performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Full&#8208;Color Tunable Time&#8208;Dependent Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Self&#8208;Protective Carbonized Polymer Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Full&#8208;color tunable time&#8208;dependent room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from self&#8208;protective carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) is achieved via a self&#8208;doping strategy for simultaneous modulation of their carbon core N&#8208;related and surface oxygen&#8208;related emissive centers. The broad emission color, long lifetime, and excellent luminescence stability of these dynamic afterglow materials promote their practical applications in multimodal anti&#8208;counterfeiting and advanced dynamic information encryption, as well as time&#8208;delay light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs).








Abstract
Achieving full&#8208;color time&#8208;dependent tunable phosphorescence (TDTP) in pure organic materials remains a significant challenge due to the nonradiative transition and modulation puzzle of triplet states. Herein, full&#8208;color TDTP has been realized in self&#8208;protective carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) under ambient conditions using a self&#8208;doping strategy. These CPDs are generated with dual emission centers of the high&#8208;energy N&#8208;related triplet state and the low&#8208;energy surface oxide triplet state, which are responsible for the slow&#8208;decaying blue afterglow (453&#160;nm) and the fast&#8208;decaying green to red afterglow (513&#8211;609&#160;nm), respectively. These luminescent centers can be activated simultaneously upon CPD aggregation due to the generated rigid networks by intra/intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;band interactions. The detailed experimental characterization and theoretical calculation confirm that the red&#8208;shifted afterglow color is attributed to a gradual reduction of their energy levels with the increasing surface C&#9552;O content and aggregation degree of CPDs. Thus, these matrix&#8208;free CPDs exhibit dynamic TDTP colors over the entire visible spectrum in the solid state after turning off 365&#160;nm UV light. Based on their unusual phosphorescent properties and excellent photostability, these CPDs have been tested for various applications such as multidimensional dynamic information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting, as well as time&#8208;delayed light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs).

         <title>Upcycling Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Constructing Bifunctional Catalysts Featuring Long&#8208;Range Order and Short&#8208;Range Disorder for Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, for the first time, an interesting strategy is proposed for upcycling Ni, Co, and Mn valuable metals from spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries into a bifunctional catalyst for lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries by a rapid Joule&#8208;heated thermal shock method. This is a well&#8208;defined catalyst combining both features of long&#8208;range order L12 face&#8208;centered cubic structure and short&#8208;range disorder in M sites. Benefiting from the unique atomic arrangement, the long&#8208;range order L12 structure significantly enhances the long&#8208;term stability of the catalyst, while the short&#8208;range disorder character of the M site triggers the cocktail effect and further activates the Pt catalytic kinetics. Experiments and theoretical results disclose that the local coordination environment and electronic distribution of Pt are both fundamentally modulated via surrounding disordered Ni, Co, and Mn atoms, which greatly optimize the affinity toward oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates and facilitate the deposition/decomposition kinetics of the thin&#8208;film Li2O2 discharge products. This distinctly lowers both the energy barriers of the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Upcycling of high&#8208;value metals (M = Ni, Co, Mn) from spent ternary lithium&#8208;ion batteries to the field of lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries is highly appealing, yet remains a huge challenge. In particular, the alloying of the recovered M components with Pt and applied as cathode catalysts have not yet been reported. Herein, a fresh L12&#8208;type Pt3&#160;M medium&#8208;entropy intermetallic nanoparticle is first proposed, confined on N&#8208;doped carbon matrix (L12&#8208;Pt3(Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3)@N&#8208;C) based on spent 111 typed LiNi1&#8208;x&#8208;yMnxCoyO2 cathode. This well&#8208;defined catalyst combines both features of long&#8208;range order L12 face&#8208;centered cubic structure and short&#8208;range disorder in M sites. The former contributes to enhancing the structural stability, and the latter further facilitates deeply activating the catalytic activity of Pt sites. Experiments and theoretical results demonstrate that the local coordination environment and electronic distribution of Pt are both fundamentally modulated via surrounding disordered Ni, Co, and Mn atoms, which greatly optimize the affinity toward oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates and facilitate the deposition/decomposition kinetics of the thin&#8208;film Li2O2 discharge products. Specifically, the L12&#8208;Pt3(Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3)@N&#8208;C catalyst exhibits an ultra&#8208;low overpotential of 0.48&#160;V and achieves 220 cycles at 400&#160;mA g&#8722;1 under 1000 mAh g&#8722;1. The work provides important insights for the recycling of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries into advanced catalyst&#8208;related applications.

         <title>Superhigh Magnetostriction in Non&#8208;Equilibrium Grown Fe&#8208;Ga Single&#8208;Crystals by Rapid&#8208;Directional&#8208;Solidification</title>

         <dc:description>
An innovative strategy of rapid&#8208;directional&#8208;solidification is developed to unexpectedly grow non&#8208;equilibrium single&#8208;crystals of Fe&#8208;Ga magnetostrictive material with the supersaturation of Tb, leading to an unprecedentedly giant magnetostriction of 489&#160;ppm in bulk Fe&#8208;Ga single&#8208;crystals. This study paves the way for realizing revolutionary material performance by innovating the concept and fabrication method of non&#8208;equilibrium single&#8208;crystals.








Abstract
The non&#8208;equilibrium microstructure characterized by Tb supersaturation within Fe&#8208;Ga single&#8208;crystals is deduced to induce a substantial enhancement in magnetostriction. However, the growth of the non&#8208;equilibrium single&#8208;crystal remains a formidable obstacle, as existing methods can only produce either non&#8208;equilibrium polycrystal or near&#8208;equilibrium single&#8208;crystal, leading to the stagnation in magnetostriction. Herein, a rapid&#8208;directional&#8208;solidification (RDS) strategy is devised to grow non&#8208;equilibrium single&#8208;crystals. The RDS is realized through achieving an ultrahigh temperature gradient of &#8776;106 K&#160;m&#8722;1 at S&#8208;L interface front, accompanied by an ultrafast growth velocity. This results in single&#8208;crystal growth under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions with a giant cooling rate of 102&#8211;103 K&#160;s&#8722;1, which is &#8776;1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude greater than the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of directional&#8208;solidification methods. A non&#8208;equilibrium Fe&#8208;Ga single&#8208;crystal, featured with traces of Tb supersaturation, is successfully grown with a significantly enhanced magnetostriction of 489&#160;ppm. This magnitude of magnetostriction sets a record in bulk Fe&#8208;Ga materials, surpassing the maximum value reported for Fe&#8208;Ga single&#8208;crystals by 60%. The advent of RDS strategy opens an avenue for fabricating non&#8208;equilibrium single&#8208;crystals with revolutionary performance, and paves the way for fabricating currently unattainable single&#8208;crystals for engineering applications.

         <title>Enabling High Reversibility of Both Cationic and Anionic Redox in Layered Oxide Cathodes via NiMn6 Superlattice Topology for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The layered oxide cathode material (NNLMO) with the LiMn6 and NiMn6 dual&#8208;topology superlattice is constructed for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, realizing the reversible cationic and anionic redox.

High&#8208;voltage oxygen anionic redox provides a transformative opportunity to achieve high energy density of batteries. However, it is challenging to guarantee the reversibility of both cationic and anionic redox for layered transition metal (TM) oxide cathode materials due to the high oxygen&#8208;redox reactivity and the complex structural rearrangements. Herein, a honeycomb&#8208;layered Na0.78Ni0.12Li0.18Mn0.7O2 (NNLMO) cathode material with the NiMn6 and LiMn6 dual&#8208;topology superlattice is proposed for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate that the Ni2+ electronic configuration serves as a redox buffer to tune the cationic and anionic redox activity by enlarging the energy gap between O 2p and Mn 3d orbitals, while the NiMn6 topology renders the LiMn6 topology delocalized in the TM layers to reinforce the superstructure stability through suppressing the intralayer Mn migration and O2 formation. As a result, NNLMO delivers a highly reversible capacity of 224 mAh g&#8722;1 with the mitigated voltage hysteresis and exhibits remarkable capacity retention of 92.2% over 50 cycles within the wide voltage range of 1.5&#8211;4.5&#160;V. The findings suggest a new insight into the topological superstructure design of high&#8208;energy oxide cathode materials for sustainable batteries.

         <title>Toward Switching and Fusing Neuromorphic Computing: Vertical Bulk Heterojunction Transistors with Multi&#8208;Neuromorphic Functions for Efficient Deep Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zou et al propose a novel vertical bulk heterojunction neuromorphic transistor, integrating three functions of the synapse, artificial spiking neuron, and artificial self&#8208;activation neuron for the first time. By simply changing the program, it can switch between spiking neurons and self&#8208;activating neurons, which effectively facilitates seamless switching and fusion computation of artificial neural networks and spiking neural networks.








Abstract
The combination of artificial neural networks (ANN) and spiking neural networks (SNN) holds great promise for advancing artificial general intelligence (AGI). However, the reported ANN and SNN computational architectures are independent and require a large number of auxiliary circuits and external algorithms for fusion training. Here, a novel vertical bulk heterojunction neuromorphic transistor (VHNT) capable of emulating both ANN and SNN computational functions is presented. TaOx&#8208;based electrochemical reactions and PDVT&#8208;10/N2200&#8208;based bulk heterojunctions are used to realize spike coding and voltage coding, respectively. Notably, the device exhibits remarkable efficiency, consuming a mere 0.84 nJ of energy consumption for a single multiply accumulate (MAC) operation with excellent linearity. Moreover, the device can be switched to spiking neuron and self&#8208;activation neuron by simply changing the programming without auxiliary circuits. Finally, the VHNT&#8208;based artificial spiking neural network (ASNN) fusion simulation architecture is demonstrated, achieving 95% accuracy for Canadian&#8208;Institute&#8208;For&#8208;Advanced&#8208;ResearchResearch&#8208;10 (CIFARResearch&#8208;10) dataset while significantly enhancing training speed and efficiency. This work proposes a novel device strategy for developing high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;power, and environmentally adaptive AGI.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Lead&#8208;Free Ceramics With Simultaneously High Piezoelectricity and High Mechanical Quality Factor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piezoelectric materials with high piezoelectric coefficient (d33) and high mechanical quality factor (Qm) are critical for advanced high&#8208;power applications. However, achieving this combination is challenging due to the inherent trade&#8208;off between d33 and Qm. This work reports a novel strategy involving the introduction of defect dipoles into quadruple point compositions to break the conventional trade&#8208;off and simultaneously enhance d33 to 710 pC/N and Qm to 929 in designed lead&#8208;free piezoelectric materials.








Abstract
Piezoelectric materials with a high piezoelectric coefficient (d33) and high mechanical quality factor (Qm) are vital for advanced high&#8208;power applications. However, achieving this combination is challenging, particularly for lead&#8208;free piezoelectrics, because a high d33 value relies on mobile domain walls, which increase dissipative losses and reduce Qm. In this study, this longstanding trade&#8208;off is overcome by introducing defect dipoles (via Mn doping) into the quadruple point (QP) composition of the lead&#8208;free Ba(Sn, Ti)O3 system. The resultant 0.5%Mn&#8208;doped Ba(Sn0.11Ti0.89)O3 (BST&#8208;0.5%Mn) ceramic exhibits a high d33 value of 710 pC/N and high Qm value of 929, while the BST&#8208;1%Mn ceramic achieves a d33 value of 614 pC/N and Qm value of 1138. These values represent a 10&#8208;fold increase in Qm and 1.6&#8208;fold increase in d33 for BST&#8208;0.5%Mn, compared to those for undoped BST. High&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and phase&#8208;field simulations reveal that the enhanced d33 and Qm are attributable to the coexistence of multiple phases of QPs with symmetry&#8208;conforming defect dipoles, challenging the long&#8208;held notion of physical incompatibility between high d33 and high Qm. These findings offer a pathway for designing eco&#8208;friendly piezoelectric materials with unprecedented performance, paving the way for sustainable and efficient high&#8208;power applications.

         <title>Strut&#8208;Buckling Transformation Enabling Anomalous Density&#8208;Scaling Toughening Law in Ultralight Lattice Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work uncovers an anomalous density&#8208;scaling toughening law in discrete lattices, where ultrahigh&#160;specific fracture toughness can be achieved at ultralow relative density, thereby filling gaps in material property space. This anomalous toughening law stems from crack&#8208;tip blunting triggered by delocalized strut&#8208;buckling transformation at ultralow densities, which is universal across various lattice metamaterials with varying sizes, topologies, and component properties.








Abstract
Lightweight lattice metamaterials attract considerable attention due to their exceptional and tunable mechanical properties. However, their practical application is ultimately limited by their tolerance to inevitable&#160;manufacturing defects. Traditional fracture mechanics of lattice metamaterials are confined to localized tensile failure of a crack&#8208;tip strut, overlooking the toughening effect of buckling instability in discrete struts around the crack front. Here, via a combination of additive manufacturing, numerical simulation, and theoretical analysis, this work identifies an anomalous power scaling law of specific fracture energy with relative density, where the scaling exponent shifts to negative values below a critical relative density. This anomalous toughening law stems from crack&#8208;tip blunting triggered by delocalized strut&#8208;buckling transformation at ultralow densities, which is universal across various lattice metamaterials with varying length scales, crack orientations, node connectivity, and component properties. By strategically harnessing strut buckling mechanisms, exceptionally high specific fracture toughness can be achieved at extremely low relative density, thereby addressing gaps in the material property design space. These findings not only provide physical insights into discrete lattice fracture but also offer design motifs for ultralight, ultra&#8208;tough lattice metamaterials.

         <title>Narrow&#8208;Linewidth Emission and Weak Exciton&#8208;Phonon Coupling in 2D Layered Germanium Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural and photophysical properties of the 2D layered metal halides (4F&#8208;PMA)2GeI4 and (4F&#8208;PMA)2PbI4 are reported. For the Ge composition, reduced exciton&#8208;phonon coupling is found and the absence of bound&#8208;exciton emission, present for the Pb composition. The narrowest reported emission linewidth from a Ge&#8208;based 2D metal halide is measured, to date, suggesting that Ge&#8208;based materials offer a promising, less&#8208;toxic alternative for light&#8208;emitting applications.








Abstract
The photophysical properties of low&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;halide semiconductors and their tunability make them promising candidates for light&#8208;absorbing and emitting applications. Yet, the germanium&#8208;based halide perovskites to date lack desirable light&#8208;emitting properties, with so far only very broad, weak, and unstructured photoluminescence (PL) reported due to significant octahedral distortion. Here, the photophysical properties of the 2D layered Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper semiconductors (4F&#8208;PMA)2GeI4 and (4F&#8208;PMA)2PbI4 (4F&#8208;PMA: 4&#8208;F&#8208;phenylmethylammonium) are characterized and compared. Using a combination of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, variable temperature time&#8208;resolved PL, and density functional theory, structure&#8208;property relations are correlated. Specifically, the results indicate that (4F&#8208;PMA)2PbI4 features stronger coupling to longitudinal optical (LO) phonons, assisting emission from a broad bound&#8208;exciton state due to a soft, deformable lattice. In contrast, (4F&#8208;PMA)2GeI4, benefitting from intermolecular bonding to scaffold a rigid octahedral structure, shows weaker LO&#8208;phonon coupling, resulting in the longest PL lifetime and most narrow linewidth (&#8776;120 meV linewidth at 2 K) reported for a Ge&#8208;halide perovskite yet, without the occurrence of any additional bound&#8208;state emission at low temperatures. These results highlight the potential of germanium halide perovskite materials for optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Cell Surface&#8208;Tethered Nucleic Acid Therapeutics Program Robust and Tumor&#8208;Responsive Enhancement of Adoptive Cell Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy (ACT) against solid tumors is limited by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. This study develops cell&#8208;surface&#8208;anchored tumor&#8208;responsive nucleic acid therapeutics (NATs) to arm ACT cells by synergistic blockade of inhibitory pathways. NAT backpacks substantially improve the efficacy of ACT and are broadly applicable to various ACTs involving TCR&#8208;T and CAR&#8208;T cells.








Abstract
The efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy (ACT) against solid tumors is significantly limited by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Systemic administration of immunostimulants provides inadequate support to ACT cells and often elicits systemic toxicities. Here we present cell&#8208;surface&#8208;anchored nucleic acid therapeutics (NATs) to robustly enhance ACT through synergistic blockade of immunosuppressive adenosine and PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 pathways in tumors. Two distinct NATs&#8208;DNA aptamers targeting PD&#8208;L1 (aptPD&#8208;L1) and ATP (aptATP)&#8208;are engineered to form partially&#8208;hybridized duplexes (aptDual) that can efficiently anchor to cell surface before transfer. Backpacked aptDual spatial&#8208;temporally co&#8208;localize with ACT cells in vivo and jointly infiltrate the ATP&#8208;rich TME. Upon binding with ATP, aptDual dissociates to responsively release aptPD&#8208;L1. Concurrently, aptATP scavenges extracellular ATP and its metabolite adenosine to disrupt the inhibitory adenosinergic axis, thereby sensitizing ACT cells to immune checkpoint blockade by aptPD&#8208;L1. This dual inhibition elicited a remarkable 40&#8208;fold increase in functional tumor&#8208;infiltrating ACT cells, substantially boosting the efficacy of TCR&#8208;T and CAR&#8208;T cells in multiple solid tumor models, even in immunologically &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors. NAT backpacks provide a facile, versatile, and safe strategy to augment various ACTs against solid tumors.

         <title>An Optimized Aerogel&#8208;Based Apheresis Device for Targeted Lipid Clearance in Elderly Hyperlipidemia Patients</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research introduces an aerogel apheresis device specifically designed for hyperlipidemia management in elderly patients. Leveraging the unique properties of aerogels, LipClean achieves selective lipid adsorption from plasma while maintaining efficiency and biocompatibility. The optimized hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic network ensures effective water permeability and reduces the unintended removal of essential plasma components.








Abstract
Elderly patients with hyperlipidemia often exhibit resistance to conventional hypolipidemic treatments, underscoring the need for more effective strategies to address lipid imbalances in this high&#8208;risk group. This study introduces LipClean, an aerogel&#8208;based apheresis device specifically designed to remove harmful plasma lipids. LipClean is constructed using hydrophilic cellulose fibers, which serve as a supramolecular platform for synthesizing hydrophobic conjugated polymers through a Sonogashira&#8208;Hagihara reaction. These conjugated polymers are then cross&#8208;linked with the cellulose fibers via phosphorylation, generating an aerogel monolith with an interpenetrating network of hydrophilic fibers and hydrophobic polymers. Unlike bilayer aerogels that separate hydrophilic and hydrophobic layers, LipClean's interpenetrating structure is precisely engineered through polymer design and gradient cross&#8208;linking. This optimization enhances both bodily fluid flow and lipid adsorption while minimizing the removal of essential plasma components and ensuring unobstructed cell passage. In preclinical testing, LipClean significantly reduced triglyceride and cholesterol levels in an elderly rat model of hyperlipidemia and normalized lipid levels in blood samples from hypertensive patients. Importantly, purified blood maintained normal levels of blood cells and physiological and biochemical indicators after apheresis, highlighting LipClean's potential for managing hyperlipidemia&#8208;related disorders. This study, therefore, underscores the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in driving medical device innovation.

         <title>Electroadhesion Suction Cups</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electroadhesion (EA) Suction Cups are electrically operated soft grippers that can pick up a wide range of objects from the top. A soft membrane, driven by electrostatic forces, conforms to surfaces, creating a passive vacuum when lifted. EA suction cups eliminate bulky vacuum systems, offering a compact, efficient, and portable alternative for industrial and service robotics.








Abstract
Suction cups are the light bulbs of robotics and automation. They are simple, reliable, yet energy&#8208;hungry, and require a bulky and noisy vacuum infrastructure. This work reports Electroadhesion (EA) Suction Cups: soft, silent, monolithic, electrically&#8208;driven grippers, with a power consumption of only 1.5&#160;W, that can grasp flat and curved objects, with smooth or rough surfaces, holding payloads up to 1.5&#160;kg. This performance is enabled by a deeper understanding of the contact mechanics of electroadhesion systems. A thin and soft membrane containing interdigitated electrodes zips onto the object driven by electrostatic forces, conforming to the object's shape and thus establishing large&#8208;area contact. The lifting force is transmitted to a robot arm through a small pillar connected at the center of the membrane. This design maximizes the peeling force and enables the formation of passive vacuum inside the conical chamber formed when the membrane stretches during lifting. Object release is obtained by turning off the voltage and optionally by opening a valve to quickly break the vacuum. EA suction cups address many shortcomings of widely used vacuum&#8208;driven grippers, offering a compact, fully electric, and energy&#8208;efficient solution that meets the needs for efficiency and portability in both industrial and service robotics.

         <title>Modulation of Magnetic Domain and the Occurrence of Antisymmetric Magnetoresistance in the Folded van der Waals Ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new methodology is demonstrated that leverages the flexible nature of van der Waals ferromagnet, specifically employing an origami technique to modulate magnetic domains. A previously rarely observed antisymmetric magnetoresistance effect is detected in folded vdW Fe3GaTe2 devices. The results highlight the potential for fabricating novel spintronic devices based on this origami&#8208;like domain structure engineering method.








Abstract
Emergent magnetism in 2D materials has attracted significant attention due to their intrinsic magnetic order, which persists down to the monolayer limit, and their potential applications in spintronic devices. In particular, domain structure modulation plays a crucial role in 2D magnet&#8208;based nano&#8208;spintronic devices. However, the fabrication and modulation of the desired domain structure, along with the establishment of reliable electrical write/read operations, remain significant challenges.

&lt;p&gt;A new methodology is demonstrated that leverages the flexible nature of van der Waals ferromagnet, specifically employing an origami technique to modulate magnetic domains. A previously rarely observed antisymmetric magnetoresistance effect is detected in folded vdW Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GaTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; devices. The results highlight the potential for fabricating novel spintronic devices based on this origami-like domain structure engineering method.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emergent magnetism in 2D materials has attracted significant attention due to their intrinsic magnetic order, which persists down to the monolayer limit, and their potential applications in spintronic devices. In particular, domain structure modulation plays a crucial role in 2D magnet-based nano-spintronic devices. However, the fabrication and modulation of the desired domain structure, along with the establishment of reliable electrical write/read operations, remain significant challenges. Herein, a unique structure-shaping way to modulate domain structure is demonstrated via folding a continuous flat Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GaTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheet. Accompanied by magnetic domain structure transformation, the symmetric butterfly-shaped magnetoresistance (MR) curve changes to an antisymmetric field-dependent magnetoresistance. Notably, the MR exhibits either the same or opposite sign at geometrically equivalent positions, depending on the relative angle of the current flow and domain wall direction. The MR behavior with respect to sweeping field and electrodes position is due to the circulating current in the vicinity of the domain wall. More importantly, this new concept of manipulating domain structure and its associated magneto-transport behavior can inspire novel spintronic devices fabrication and application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Uniaxiality&#8208;Induced Reduced&#8208;Pressure Synthesis of Ultrahard Paracrystalline Diamond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Paracrystalline diamond, a new&#8208;type sp3&#8208;bonded non&#8208;crystalline carbon, is synthesized at 16 GPa (vs. 30 GPa in previous reports) via uniaxial stress&#8208;induced collapse of C60 at lower pressures. By integrating experimental and computational insights, this work opens avenues for designing novel materials through controlled stress environments under pressure and offers a strategy for low&#8208;cost high&#8208;pressure material production.








Abstract
Synthesizing fully sp3&#8208;bonded non&#8208;crystalline carbon remains a long&#8208;standing challenge due to the intrinsic instability of the sp3 bond at ambient pressure. Recently, paracrystalline diamond, a new&#8208;form sp3&#8208;bonded non&#8208;crystalline carbon consisting of sub&#8208;nanometer&#8208;sized paracrystallites, has been synthesized from face&#8208;centered cubic C60 at 30&#160;GPa, which has attracted attention due to its unique structural features and excellent physical properties. However, the ultrahigh synthesis pressure of paracrystalline diamond poses an obstacle to its large&#8208;scale production and applications. In this study, paracrystalline diamond is synthesized at an exceptionally low pressure (16 GPa) via inducing uniaxiality at high&#8208;pressure and high&#8208;temperature conditions, thereby breaking through the temperature&#8208;pressure phase diagram of C60. By combining structural characteristics and advanced molecular dynamics simulation, the remarkable reduction of synthesis pressure is attributed to the fact that the symmetry of the C60 cage is broken due to the uniaxiality, which further allows the C60 cage to collapse at much lower pressures. This work reveals the critical role of uniaxiality in the reduced&#8208;pressure synthesis of paracrystalline diamond, which may provide a potent methodological strategy for the development of novel low&#8208;cost high&#8208;pressure materials.

         <title>Pressure Induced Molecular&#8208;Arrangement and Charge&#8208;Density Perturbance in Doped Polymer for Intelligent Motion and Vocal Recognitions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sidechain doped polymer is investigated to have great potential for pressure detection due to the advantages including molecular rearrangement and charge&#8208;density perturbance induced by micro&#8208;mechanical deformation. This sensor displayed low&#8208;pressure detection limit of 0.7&#160;Pa as well as a rapid response time of 18.8&#160;ms, enabling multi&#8208;mode motion analysis and intelligent vocal recognitions.








Abstract
Conjugated polymers (CPs) show great potential for pressure detection due to the amorphous polymer packing, but a lack of clarity regarding sensing mechanisms hampers the development of further applications. Herein, a sacrificial template&#8208;full solution method with both rough surface and high conductivity is described that can be applied to sandwich&#8208;structured resistive pressure sensors. Transient absorption measurements demonstrate the significant increase of carrier lifetime (from 1.44 to 2.54&#160;ns) induced by pressure, which directly evidenced the superior sensing mechanism of sidechain doped conjugated polymer. This sensor displayed low&#8208;pressure detection limit of 0.7&#160;Pa as well as a rapid response time of 18.8&#160;ms, enabling multi&#8208;mode motion analysis including wrist pulse, swallowing, finger bending, grabbing, and typing. Additionally, an intelligent vocal recognition system with convolutional neural networks is used which can achieve &gt;96% classification accuracy across diverse vocal profiles. This general approach is anticipated and enables a new direction for the development of pressure sensors.

         <title>A Sprayable Hydrogel Based on Biomimetic Polypeptide&#8208;Modified Lipid Nanoparticles for Treating Non&#8208;Compressible Hemorrhaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a sprayable hydrogel based on polypeptide&#8208;modified lipid nanoparticles (PLNs) mimicking natural hemostasis. PLNs integrate platelet adhesion peptide (GFOGER) and platelet crosslinking peptide (GGQQLK), DSPS, and Ca2&#8314; to activate coagulation. Combined with Ca2&#8314;&#8208;sodium alginate hydrogels, they synergistically enhance rapid clot formation via platelet aggregation, prothrombin activation, and fibrin crosslinking, offering an efficient biomimetic strategy for hemorrhage.








Abstract
Non&#8208;compressible hemorrhaging is the main cause of death in modern warfare. A biomimetic peptide&#8208;modified lipid nanoparticle&#8208;based sprayable hydrogel is developed to mimic and amplify the blood coagulation process for effective hemostasis. A platelet adhesion peptide (PAP, sequence: GFOGER) and platelet crosslinking peptide (PCP, sequence: GGQQLK) are customized and conjugated to 1,2&#8208;distearoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphoethanolamine&#8208;N[methoxy (polyethylene glycol) 2000] acid (DSPE&#8208;PEG2000&#8208;COOH) via amido bonds to form DSPE&#8208;PEG&#8208;PAP and DSPE&#8208;PEG&#8208;PCP, respectively. These compounds are mixed with distearoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphocholine, cholesterol, and distearoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phospho&#8208;L&#8208;serine (DSPS) to construct the peptide&#8208;modified lipid nanoparticles via thin film rehydration. The nanoparticles are incorporated into a CaCl2&#8208;sodium alginate sprayable hydrogel crosslinked via ionic bonds. The application of the hydrogel solution quickly gels and seals the wound. The PAP activates and adheres platelets, the DSPS and Ca2+ amplify prothrombin activation, and PCP strengthens the fibrin network. The hydrogel achieves rapid hemostasis within 30 s in a liver hemorrhage model. This sprayable hydrogel has significant potential for managing non&#8208;compressible hemorrhaging.

         <title>Pushing the Limits: Maximizing Energy Density in Silicon Sulfide Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;energy silicon solid&#8208;state battery exceeding 400&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8315;&#185; is demonstrated using a 99.9&#160;wt% micro&#8208;Si anode, a thin sulfide electrolyte, and high&#8208;loading NMC811 cathode. Optimized dry/wet processing and interface engineering enable excellent cell cycling stability. Key degradation mechanisms are identified, providing strategies to enhance long&#8208;term performance of solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
For the first time, we demonstrate a silicon solid&#8208;state battery (SSB) architecture that achieves &gt;400 Wh kg&#8722;1, approaching the theoretical limit for silicon&#8208;based SSBs. This configuration features a 99.9 wt% micro&#8208;Si, a thin sulfide solid electrolyte (SSE), and a high&#8208;loading NMC811. Key to these results is strategically selecting and evaluating the processing techniques, whether wet or dry, for the negative electrode, positive electrode and thin sheet&#8208;type SSE. Excessive lithium incorporation into the silicon host, beyond the Li3.75+Si phase to form a LiSi composite, is essential to match the high capacity of the positive electrode. This SSB achieves over 1000 cycles for a 2 mAh cm&#8722;2 with &#8776;80% capacity retention and 94% capacity retention for 3 mAh cm&#8722;2 over 500 cycles at 25 &#176;C. Post analysis identifies the primary capacity decay mechanisms as oxidation at the NMC/SSE interface and structural disruptions within NMC. Meanwhile, the Si electrode maintains a robust solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase layer, minimizing capacity decay. This study highlights the necessity for improved NMC coatings, lattice oxygen stabilization, and a durable positive electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface to improve the long&#8208;term stability of SSBs. Strategies leading to a single&#8208;layer pouch cell SSB exceeding 400 Wh kg&#8722;1 are developed.

&lt;p&gt;A high-energy silicon solid-state battery exceeding 400&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8315;&#185; is demonstrated using a 99.9&#160;wt% micro-Si anode, a thin sulfide electrolyte, and high-loading NMC811 cathode. Optimized dry/wet processing and interface engineering enable excellent cell cycling stability. Key degradation mechanisms are identified, providing strategies to enhance long-term performance of solid-state batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we demonstrate a silicon solid-state battery (SSB) architecture that achieves &amp;gt;400 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, approaching the theoretical limit for silicon-based SSBs. This configuration features a 99.9 wt% micro-Si, a thin sulfide solid electrolyte (SSE), and a high-loading NMC811. Key to these results is strategically selecting and evaluating the processing techniques, whether wet or dry, for the negative electrode, positive electrode and thin sheet-type SSE. Excessive lithium incorporation into the silicon host, beyond the Li&lt;sub&gt;3.75&lt;/sub&gt;+Si phase to form a LiSi composite, is essential to match the high capacity of the positive electrode. This SSB achieves over 1000 cycles for a 2 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with &#8776;80% capacity retention and 94% capacity retention for 3 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; over 500 cycles at 25 &#176;C. Post analysis identifies the primary capacity decay mechanisms as oxidation at the NMC/SSE interface and structural disruptions within NMC. Meanwhile, the Si electrode maintains a robust solid-electrolyte interphase layer, minimizing capacity decay. This study highlights the necessity for improved NMC coatings, lattice oxygen stabilization, and a durable positive electrode-electrolyte interface to improve the long-term stability of SSBs. Strategies leading to a single-layer pouch cell SSB exceeding 400 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; are developed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Lower&#8208;Occupied Through&#8208;Bond Interactions for Efficient Organic Phosphorescence Enabling High&#8208;Resolution Long&#8208;Wavelength Afterglow</title>

         <dc:description>
Selective low&#8208;occupancy carbon&#8208;sulfur through&#8208;bond interactions enhance the organic red room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) to 46% yield with an emission lifetime of 0.43 s from materials without containing elements from the 4th period or higher. This significant improvement in organic red RTP yield enables high&#8208;resolution afterglow emission detection from individual nanoparticles even in the long wavelength region without relying on ambient autofluorescence. 








Abstract
Persistent organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) enables high&#8208;resolution afterglow bioimaging, independent of autofluorescence. However, the yield of organic RTP in the long&#8208;wavelength region is generally low, which limits the high&#8208;resolution information that can be obtained from the long&#8208;wavelength region. Moreover, this makes it impossible to obtain multicolor and high&#8208;resolution afterglow images. This report describes a molecule containing no atoms from the fourth or higher period that exhibits efficient red RTP in high yield. A molecule with red phosphorescent chromophores substituted with multiple phenylthio groups reached an RTP yield of 46.3% and an RTP lifetime of 0.43 s in an appropriate crystalline host medium. The selective lower&#8208;occupied through&#8208;bond or through&#8208;space interactions among molecules significantly enhance the phosphorescence in the long&#8208;wavelength region. The highly efficient and bright red persistent RTP induces a red afterglow from individual nanoparticles. Tuning the selective lower&#8208;occupied through&#8208;bond or through&#8208;space interactions allows for the design of high&#8208;performance RTP dyes and offers a novel approach to explore high&#8208;resolution full&#8208;color afterglow imaging.

         <title>Modulating Crystal Growth with Sacrificial Coordination for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells via Intense Pulsed Light Annealing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
DodecylMSO, a sacrificial Lewis base additive, modulates perovskite crystallization during intense pulsed light annealing by strongly binding PbI&#8322; and volatilizing at high temperatures. This results in larger grains, lower defect density, and minimum trace residues, achieving the highest efficiency in its class.








Abstract
Intense pulsed light (IPL) annealing has emerged as a transformative technology for the high&#8208;throughput, low&#8208;cost fabrication of perovskite films, enabling the rapid conversion of precursor wet films into perovskite films within milliseconds. Despite their potential, the efficiencies of IPL&#8208;processed devices have yet to match those achieved through conventional thermal annealing (TA), primarily due to the challenges of uncontrolled crystallization and defect formation during the IPL process. In this study, a solid Lewis base additive, dodecyl methyl sulfoxide (DodecylMSO) is introduced, to modulate perovskite crystal growth and improve film morphology and uniformity under IPL conditions. DodecylMSO acts as a sacrificial additive, with X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirming the majority of it is removed in the final films. Compared to the control films, DodecylMSO&#8208;modified films exhibited significantly reduced defect densities and enhanced carrier extraction and transport properties. Leveraging this approach, p&#8208;i&#8208;n perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is demonstrated with a champion power conversion efficiency of 23.5% fabricated via IPL. This sacrificial coordination strategy not only addresses key challenges in IPL processing but also opens new avenues for advancing the manufacturability and scalability of high&#8208;performance PSCs.

         <title>Bifunctional Compound Induced Dual Back Surface Fields for Efficient Hole Transport Layer&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;based hole&#8208;transport&#8208;layer&#8208;free perovskite solar cells present a cost&#8208;effective and stable photovoltaic alternative but suffer from low efficiency due to the absence of back surface field (BSF). In this work,&#160;trityl tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate&#160;is utilized to engineer&#160;dual BSFs, significantly enhancing open&#8208;circuit voltage and leading to a&#160;champion efficiency of 20.79%&#8212;marking a substantial improvement in device performance.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based hole transport layer&#8208;free (C&#8208;HTL&#8208;free) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are promising for low&#8208;cost and stable photovoltaics, but the HTL absence deteriorates their power conversion efficiency (PCE) due to the lack of back surface field (BSF). In this work, the benefits of forming dual BSFs in improving the PCE of C&#8208;HTL&#8208;free PSCs are first investigated by simulation. Then, trityl tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate (Tr+TPFB&#8722;) is introduced into the C&#8208;HTL&#8208;free PSCs by post&#8208;treatment for the first time, which enables the formation of dual BSFs. TPFB&#8722; passivates n&#8208;doping defects in perovskite and leads to the formation of perovskite n&#8208;p homojunction, while Tr+ extracts electrons from carbon and lowers its work function, which succeeds realizing dual BSFs. This improves the separation and extraction of photocarriers within the device, which is evidenced by the photoluminescence lifetime imaging of the device cross&#8208;section for the first time. As a result, the average open&#8208;circuit voltage increases significantly by about 70&#160;mV, which largely contributes to the improvement of PCE with a champion value of 20.79% obtained.

         <title>Functional Group Engineering Stabilizing Precursor Solution and Passivating Defects for Operationally Stable and Highly Reproducible Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The degradation of perovskite precursors is suppressed by modulating the position and type of functional groups in stabilizers. 4&#8208;hydrazinobenzenesulfonic acid (4&#8208;HBSA), with the lowest pKa, effectively improved stability, passivated grain boundary defects, and increased carrier lifetime, leading to a maximum PCE of 26.79% in inverted PSCs fabricated by vacuum flash technology under ambient conditions.








Abstract
The instability of perovskite precursor solution induced by deprotonation of organic cations and oxidation of iodide ions substantially deteriorates the reproducibility and reliability of the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The above decomposition reactions can be conquered via the synergistic engineering of organic functional groups. However, how spatial conformation and type of weak acid functional groups impact the stability of perovskite precursor solution remains to be investigated. Herein, it is uncovered that the position of functional groups on the benzene and the type of weak acid functional groups remarkably influence the acid dissociation constant (pKa) and thus the stability of perovskite inks. The pKa plays a decisive role in suppressing the deprotonation of organic cations and following the amine&#8208;cation addition&#8208;elimination reaction. The 4&#8208;hydrazinobenzenesulfonic acid (4&#8208;HBSA) with the lowest pKa is optimal in stabilizing perovskite inks and mitigating nonradiative recombination through defect passivation. This breakthrough enables the inverted PSCs to deliver a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.79% (certified 26.36%, the highest PCE value for PSCs prepared in ambient conditions) using vacuum flash evaporation technology. The modulated PSC could maintain 92% of its initial efficiency after 2000&#160;h of continuous maximum power point tracking.

This breakthrough enables the inverted PSCs to deliver a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.79% (certified 26.36%, the highest PCE value for PSCs prepared in ambient conditions) using vacuum flash evaporation technology. The modulated PSC could maintain 92% of its initial efficiency after 2000&#160;h of continuous maximum power point tracking.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Superior Energy Storage Performance in a Self&#8208;Organized Trirelaxor&#8208;Antiferroelectric Nanocomposite Over a Wide Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;organized nanocomposite addresses the challenge of energy storage materials degrading at high temperatures. The nanocomposite maintains exceptional performance from room temperature to 200&#160;&#176;C, with enhanced energy density and efficiency. Through the trirelaxor matrix and nanointerface with antiferroelectric nanoparticles, it offers a promising strategy for high&#8208;temperature dielectric energy storage, overcoming polarization and breakdown degradation at elevated temperatures.








Abstract
A fundamental paradox in energy storage dielectrics lies in the challenge of achieving superior performance consistently across both room and elevated temperatures. This is addressed by designing a self&#8208;organized nanocomposite (1&#8722;x)(Ba,Sr)(Ti,Sn)O3&#8208;xBi1.5ZnNb1.5O7 composed of nano&#8208;sized antiferroelectric(AFE) particles embedded into a trirelaxor(TRE) matrix through nanoscale phase separation process. The optimal composition at x = 0.11 exhibits outstanding energy storage performance from room temperature (energy density = 8.5 J&#160;cm&#8722;3, efficiency = 94.8%, and figure of merit of 167 J&#160;cm&#8722;3) up to 200&#160;&#176;C (energy density = 4.85 J&#160;cm&#8722;3, efficiency &gt;90% and figure of merit of 49 J&#160;cm&#8722;3), outperforming existing Pb&#8208;free dielectrics. High&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy and synchrotron x&#8208;ray diffractometry reveal that the coexisting nanometric antiferroelectric particles and the trirelaxor nanodomains sustain over a wide temperature range. Piezoresponse force microscopy and phase&#8208;field simulation show that hysteresis&#8208;free switching of trirelaxor nanodomains enables enhanced polarization and low hysteretic loss. Resistivity shows a 2&#8211;3 order of magnitude increases accompanying significant increase in breakdown strength up to high temperatures, attributable to deep charge trapping effect at high&#8208;density TRE/AFE interfaces as evidenced by thermally stimulated depolarization current. These favorable effects in the nano&#8208;composite are responsible for its high energy storage performance up to high temperatures.

         <title>Assembling Octahedral Pt2Ag4 Clusters for High&#8208;Efficiency Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two enantiomeric pairs of alloy clusters composed of two Pt2Ag4 monomer are synthesized. Chiral structural transformations occurred in response to solvent stimuli, concomitant with high&#8208;contrast chiroptical switching. By manipulation of such chiral clusters, a chiral cubic lattice with high&#8208;efficiency circularly polarized luminescence is achieved. Further, the application in the information encryptions is explored.








Abstract
Establishing atom&#8208;precise and controllable self&#8208;assembly of metal clusters to achieve high&#8208;efficiency circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is especially fascinating, yet it creates considerable challenges. Here, two enantiomeric pairs of dimer clusters R/S&#8208;Pt4Ag8&#8208;green and R/S&#8208;Pt4Ag8&#8208;orange composed of two octahedral Pt2Ag4 monomers through Pt&#8211;Pt bonds are constructed, which show a 28&#8208;fold increase in photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) compared with the reported monomer in solution. The solid&#8208;state chiral dimer R/S&#8208;Pt4Ag8&#8208;orange shows a PLQY of 87% without an aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect. The intercluster distances and arrangements of the chiral cluster can be modulated through the ligand configuration and solvent stimuli, giving rise to the reversible transformations between chiral single crystals, concomitant with high&#8208;contrast optical/chiroptical switching. Additionally, by further assembling chiral Pt&#8208;Ag clusters with Ag+, a chiral 3D cubic lattice with high&#8208;efficiency red&#8208;emitting CPL is achieved. Furthermore, high&#8208;efficiency luminescence, intrinsic chirality, and the adjustable assembly behaviors of these chiral cluster assemblies bestow them with excellent smart CPL switching properties. This work opens a new avenue for high&#8208;efficiency CPL&#8208;active metal clusters by regulating metal&#8208;metal interactions.

         <title>Cellular Glycocalyx Affects Nanoparticle Access to Cell Membranes and Uptake</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cellular glycocalyx is a dense and negatively charged layer of carbohydrates that ubiquitously coats cells. Nanoparticles must permeate through the glycocalyx to access receptors on the cell surface. The glycocalyx layer regulates cellular access to nanoparticles via charge&#8208;charge interactions. By varying nanoparticle surface charges, researchers can control nanoparticle uptake to enhance the specificity of targeted drug delivery systems.









Abstract
Understanding nanoparticle interactions with cells is fundamental to designing them for medical applications. Nanoparticles must interface with the cell surface to be bound and taken up. The glycocalyx is a carbohydrate layer coating the cell surface, rendering it negatively charged. Many researchers have noted that the glycocalyx affects nanoparticle uptake, but the mechanism remains unknown,&#160;Here, we investigate the interaction between the glycocalyx and nanoparticles at the cell surface in different cell types. The glycocalyx reduced the interactions between the nanoparticles and cells, thereby reducing cellular access, binding, and uptake. The magnitude of the effect is dependent on the nanoparticle charge. Fine&#8208;tuning the charge of nanoparticles can enhance the specificity of nanoparticle targeting. Understanding the role of the glycocalyx in nano&#8208;bio interactions will allow researchers to control the interactions of nanoparticles with the cell surface.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Rare Earth Oxides Anchoring Tunable Cu&#948;+ Nanochimneys for Self&#8208;Tandem C&#8208;C Coupling Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic protocol for 2D high&#8208;entropy rare earth oxides (HE&#8208;REOs) featuring lattice distortions and oxygen vacancies is developed, representing an emerging platform for anchoring Cu&#948;+ nano&#8208;domains with tunable oxidation states. The HE&#8208;REOs&#8208;Cu&#948;+ self&#8208;tandem catalysts exhibit largely exposed synergistic sites that facilitate *CO spillover, while stabilized optimal Cu&#948;+ chimneys promote C&#9472;C couplings and interfacial channels that delocalize electrons, thereby lowering the energy barrier.








Abstract
Copper (Cu)&#8208;based materials are promising for carbon&#8208;carbon bond (C&#9472;C) coupling catalysis, but they are limited to poor structural stability, high activation energy, and low selectivity toward C2+ products. Here a customized synthetic protocol is defined for the fabrication of 2D ultrathin high&#8208;entropy rare earth (RE) oxides (HE&#8208;REOs) with rich lattice distortions and oxygen vacancies, which act as robust supports for anchoring Cu&#948;+ serial domains with tunable oxidation states. The rationally integrated HE&#8208;REOs&#8208;Cu&#948;+ heterostructures feature largely exposed synergistic multi&#8208;site driving rapid *CO spillover, and multiple stabilized Cu&#948;+ chimneys promoting cascade *CO coupling, together with intrinsic electron activation channels enabling RE 4f electron delocalization to lower the energy barrier. The optimal CeZrZnAgPbO&#8208;Cu0.44+ self&#8208;tandem catalysts achieve a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 51.7% for C2+ gaseous products at a low potential of &#8208;0.9&#160;V versus (vs) reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in H&#8208;type cell. The study proposes an &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; design principle for advanced RE&#8208;based catalysts through integrating advantageous individuals in a predictable manner.

         <title>Modular Design of T Cell Nanoengagers for Tumor Immunotherapy via Genetically Engineered Lipid&#8208;Tagged Antibody Fragments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a &#8220;plug&#8208;and&#8208;display&#8221; strategy for constructing T cell nanoengagers by directly embedding genetically engineered lipid&#8208;tagged antibodies into lipid&#8208;based nanoparticles. This versatile approach enables the design of both bi&#8208; and tri&#8208;specific nanoengagers, which effectively recruit T cells to tumor cells, enhance T cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity, and mitigate T cell exhaustion.









Abstract
T cell engagers, which bind tumor&#8208;associated antigens and T cell specific molecules, represent a promising class of immunotherapies for enhancing targeted immune responses. Here, a &#8220;plug&#8208;and&#8208;display&#8221; platform is introduced for engineering T cell nanoengagers by anchoring antibody fragments into lipid&#8208;based nanoparticles. This approach utilizes a genetically engineered lipoprotein fused with single&#8208;chain variable fragments (scFv) and nanobodies, which spontaneously integrate into lipid bilayer of the nanoparticles, achieving a high surface density of at least 0.102&#160;scFv&#160;nm&#8722;2 (&#8776;3200&#160;scFv per particle). Modular bi&#8208;specific (Lipo&#8208;BiTE) and tri&#8208;specific (Lipo&#8208;TriTE) immunoliposomes are designed to enhance anti&#8208;tumor T cell immune responses. The Lipo&#8208;BiTE, integrating anti&#8208;CD3 and anti&#8208;HER2 scFv at an optimized surface density of 1.28&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;scFv&#160;nm&#8722;2, exhibits enhanced CD8+ T cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity in HER2&#8208;positive tumor models by simultaneously engaging tumor cells and T cells. Incorporating anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 nanobodies to create Lipo&#8208;TriTE further addresses T cell exhaustion. This modular platform provides a robust foundation for designing immune cell engagers, with broad applications in targeted immunotherapy.

         <title>Constructing Water&#8208;Retaining/Ion&#8208;Regulating Bi&#8208;Layers for Highly Durable, All&#8208;Climate, Efficient Moisture Electric Generators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance moisture&#8208;electric generator is fabricated by integrating an ionic hydrogel layer with a graphene oxide film, where the designed ionic hydrogel offers ongoing power output under diverse environments while the intrinsic layering graphene oxide efficiently manages ion diffusion for enhanced electricity production. The developed device can be easily scaled up for powering various electronic devices.








Abstract
Moisture electric generators (MEGs), which can directly convert chemical energy in moisture into electricity have demonstrated great potential for powering wearable electronics and IoT devices. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MEGs suffer from transient power output and rely on high relative humidity (RH) as well as mild temperature, hampering their practical applications. Herein, a novel high&#8208;performance MEG is reported by designing ionic hydrogel and graphene oxide dual&#8208;layered devices, where the water&#8208;enriched hydrogel enables continuous power outputs under various conditions while the inherent layering nanochannels effectively regulate ion diffusion for stable and efficient performance improvement. The MEG can generate a maximum power density of 71.7&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 and continuously output 0.6&#160;V for more than 1400&#160;h at room condition without degradation. Most importantly, the developed generator can operate well from &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C to 50&#160;&#176;C, and an ultrahigh and stable voltage of 1.2&#160;V is realized at RH of 0% owing to the dynamic water equilibrium in the system. The MEG also displays excellent self&#8208;restoration capabilities, demonstrating high cyclic&#8208;performing potential. This work may provide important guidelines in designing long&#8208;life all climate applicable energy harvesting devices through designing synergistic bilayers architecture.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Recyclable Polyester Elastomers Through Transient Strain&#8208;Stiffening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transient strain&#8208;crystallization simultaneously strengthens and toughens block polyester elastomers while conserving recyclability. Using controlled polymerization catalysis and commercial monomers, block polyester elastomers outperform current commercial elastomers, entering a new region of tensile mechanical property space.








Abstract
Polyester thermoplastic elastomers are promising sustainable materials but their mechanical properties need improvement, in particular, attempts to increase strength often result in compromised elasticity. Strong and tough elastomers are known but require complex polymer formulations together with control over cross&#8208;linking or crystallinity, both of which challenge recycling. Here, the introduction of transient strain&#8208;stiffening approaches into fully amorphous structures show both strengthening and toughening of elastomers while conserving recyclability. The new amorphous block polyester elastomers are prepared by controlled polymerization methods using commercial monomers. The block polymers comprise a central poly(&#603;&#8208;caprolactone&#8208;co&#8208;&#603;&#8208;decalactone) block flanked by poly(cyclohexene oxide&#8208;alt&#8208;phthalate) blocks. Elastomer thermomechanical properties are tuned by varying ratios of &#603;&#8208;caprolactone to &#603;&#8208;decalactone within the mid&#8208;block to access materials with excellent mechanical properties. The best elastomers feature 30&#8211;50 wt.% polycaprolactone and exhibit tensile strengths up to 40&#160;MPa, elongations at break above 2000%, with excellent elastic recovery (&gt;90%). These materials exhibit strain&#8208;induced crystallization and outperform current commercial elastomers, entering a new region of tensile mechanical property space. They have service temperature ranges from &#8722;60 to 140&#160;&#176;C and high temperature stability (&#8805;300&#160;&#176;C), with wide thermal (re)processing windows. These new polyester elastomers also show high resistance to creep, humidity resistance, and excellent recyclability.

         <title>Lipid Nanoparticles Enhance mRNA Delivery to the Central Nervous System Upon Intrathecal Injection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research explores lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for enhancing mRNA delivery to the central nervous system via intrathecal injection. By chemically engineering brain&#8208;targeting small molecules into ionizable lipids (BLs), the developed BLNPs effectively facilitate mRNA delivery across the brain. Intrathecal administration of Cas9 mRNA/sgRNA using the lead BLNP achieves significant gene editing in the brain with minimal off&#8208;target effects.








Abstract
Lipid nanoparticle&#8208;messenger RNA formulations have garnered significant attention for their therapeutic potential in infectious diseases, cancer and genetic disorders. However, effective mRNA delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) remains a formidable challenge. To overcome this limitation, a class of brain&#8208;targeting lipids (BLs) is developed by incorporating brain&#8208;targeting small molecules with amino lipids and formulated them with helper lipids to generate brain&#8208;targeting lipid nanoparticles (BLNPs) for mRNA delivery. Screening studies led to a lead formulation, TD5 BLNPs, outperforming FDA&#8208;approved DLin&#8208;MC3&#8208;DMA LNPs in delivering mRNA to the brain upon intrathecal injection. Specifically, a single intrathecal injection of TD5 BLNP&#8208;GFP mRNA led to GFP expression in 29.6% of neurons and 38.1% of astrocytes across the brain. In an Ai14 mouse model, TD5 BLNP&#8208;Cre recombinase mRNA treatment induced tdTomato expression in &#8776;30% of neurons and 40% of astrocytes across major brain regions. Notably, delivery of Cas9 mRNA/sgRNA complex using TD5 BLNPs achieved effective genome editing in the brain. Additionally, TD5 BLNPs showed comparable safety profiles to MC3 LNPs, indicating promising biocompatibility. Overall, this TD5 BLNP formulation effectively delivers mRNA to brain tissues via intrathecal injection and facilitates efficient expression in both neurons and astrocytes, presenting a potential strategy for treating CNS diseases.

         <title>Friction Behavior and Microscopic Mechanism of Hydrogels in an Open&#8208;Air Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The microscopic mechanisms governing the friction characteristics of hydrogels in open&#8208;air environments are revealed through experiments, theoretical analyses, and molecular dynamics simulations. The results show that larger pore sizes and enhanced internal water mobility improve the permeability of hydrogels, allowing them to maintain a low friction coefficient by mitigating surface water loss.









Abstract
Hydrogels composed of a solvent&#8208;saturated, cross&#8208;linked polymer network exhibit unique interfacial rheology and ultralow friction, making them valuable in biomedical applications. Despite their widespread use in open&#8208;air environments, the lubrication behaviors of hydrogels under these conditions remain poorly understood. Here, the microscopic mechanisms underlying the friction characteristics of hydrogels through a combination of experiments, theoretical analyses, and molecular dynamics simulations is explored. It is found that water evaporation from the hydrogel surface reduces the hydrodynamic layer thickness and increases surface viscosity, leading to a gradual rise in friction. On the other hand, optimizing pore size and water mobility within the hydrogel enhances water transport from the interior to the surface, mitigating evaporation and enabling consistently low friction. It is also explored how soaking time, water affinity, and applied normal load influence hydrogel lubrication. The findings elucidate the microscopic mechanisms governing the friction behaviors of hydrogels and provide guidelines for designing hydrogel systems with sustained exceptional lubrication properties in open&#8208;air applications.

         <title>Super&#8208;Wide Color Tunability from a Single Electrochromic Device through In Situ Reconstruction of Optical Cavity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy is proposed utilizing in situ, electrically driven reconstruction of optical cavities on an electrochromic electrode surface to fabricate electrochromic devices with super&#8208;wide color tunability. The device fabricated by this approach can create a wide variety of colors from yellow, orange, red, violet, blue, and cyan to green in a single electrochromic device that almost spans the entire visible region.








Abstract
Electrochromic (EC) displays, as non&#8208;emissive (passive) displays with low energy consumption, have garnered significant attention from both industry and academia in recent years. Nevertheless, traditional EC technology faces challenges in achieving full&#8208;color displays within a single device due to its limited color gamut, even though full&#8208;color capability is highly desirable for eliminating the need for complex RGB subpixel mosaics. Herein, a new strategy is proposed utilizing in situ, electrically driven reconstruction of optical cavities on an electrochromic electrode surface to fabricate EC devices with super&#8208;wide color tunability. The device fabricated by this approach can create a wide variety of colors from yellow, orange, red, violet, blue, and cyan to green in a single EC device that almost spans the entire visible region (&#916;hue approaches 360&#176;). Apart from the super&#8208;wide color tunability, the devices also have small working voltage window (0.2&#8208;1.8 V), outstanding bistability (&gt;8&#160;h), extremely low power consumption (&#8776;2.3 mW cm&#8722;2) and good cycling ability (&#8776;4.3% decay rate after 1,000 cycles). Moreover, the super&#8208;wide color tunability of these EC devices has been demonstrated in diverse applications, including shifting rainbow flower images, color palettes, and information displays.

         <title>Hybrid Formative&#8208;Additive Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid Formative&#8208;Additive Manufacturing (HyFAM) integrates formative processes into additive manufacturing. HyFAM 3D&#8208;prints exterior walls and complex geometries, then formatively fills interior material. By tuning rheological properties, the study can achieve both 3D&#8208;printable ink and self&#8208;leveling, moldable ink of the same material. HyFAM speeds up part production and eliminates internal defects by replacing interior 3D&#8208;printed sections with bulk&#8208;filled material.








Abstract
Material extrusion additive manufacturing (AM) provides extensive design flexibility and exceptional material versatility, enabling the fabrication of complex, multifunctional objects ranging from embedded electronics to soft robotics and vascularized tissues. The bottom&#8208;up creation of these objects typically requires discretization into layers and voxels. However, the voxel size, determined by the nozzle diameter, limits extrusion rate, creating a conflict between resolution and speed. To address these inherent scalability challenges, the study proposes a hybrid formative&#8208;additive manufacturing technology that combines the respective strengths of each method&#8212;speed and quality with complexity and flexibility. The approach involves 3D&#8208;printing complex geometries, multimaterial features, and bounding walls of bulky, lower&#8208;resolution volumes, which are rapidly filled via casting or molding. By precisely controlling the materials&#8217; rheological properties&#8212;while maintaining similar solidified properties and high interfacial strength&#8212;several typical AM flaws, such as bulging and internal voids, are eliminated, achieving exponentially faster production speeds for objects with varying feature sizes.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Like Polymers Targeting Keap1/Nrf2 as Therapeutics for Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a Keap1 targeting protein&#8208;like polymer (PLP) which activates Nrf2, an important&#160;cytoprotective transcription factor for&#160;relieving myocardial infarction&#8208;induced oxidative stress. This PLP increases cell survival in vitro in multiple relevant cardiac cell types and elicits pro&#8208;reparative responses, improving cardiac function in a preclinical model. Keap1 inhibiting PLPs&#160;show translational potential for ischemia reperfusion injury.









Abstract
Myocardial infarction (MI) results in oxidative stress to the myocardium and frequently leads to heart failure (HF). There is an unmet clinical need to develop therapeutics that address the inflammatory stress response and prevent negative left ventricular remodeling. Here, the Keap1/Nrf2 protein&#8211;protein interaction is specifically targeted, as Nrf2 activation is known to mitigate the inflammatory response following MI. This is achieved using a Nrf2&#8208;mimetic protein&#8208;like polymer (PLP) to inhibit the Keap1&#8208;Nrf2 interaction. The PLP platform technology provides stability in vivo, potent intracellular bioactivity, and multivalency leading to high avidity Keap1 binding. In vitro and in vivo assays to probe cellular activity and MI therapeutic utility are employed. These Keap1&#8208;inhibiting PLPs (Keap1i&#8208;PLPs) impart cytoprotection from oxidative stress via Nrf2 activation at sub&#8208;nanomolar concentrations in primary cardiomyocytes. Single&#8208;digit mg kg&#8722;1, single&#8208;dose, intravenous PLP administration significantly improves cardiac function in rats post&#8208;MI through immunomodulatory, anti&#8208;apoptotic, and angiogenic mechanisms. Thus Keap1i&#8208;PLPs disrupt key intracellular protein&#8211;protein interactions following intravenous, systemic administration in vivo. These results have broad implications not only for MI but also for other oxidative stress&#8208;driven diseases and conditions.

         <title>Orbital Topology of Chiral Crystals for Orbitronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chirality is ubiquitous in nature and constitutional for life. In chiral materials the intrinsic handedness, defined by their crystal structure, becomes a main driver for a novel electronic topology that is based on the orbital angular momentum rather than the electron spin. The pivotal role of the orbital angular momentum makes chiral materials an ideal candidate for orbitronics applications.








Abstract
Chirality is ubiquitous in nature and manifests in a wide range of phenomena including chemical reactions, biological processes, and quantum transport of electrons. In quantum materials, the chirality of fermions, given by the relative directions between the electron spin and momentum, is connected to the band topology of electronic states. This study shows that in structurally chiral materials like CoSi, the orbital angular momentum (OAM) serves as the main driver of a nontrivial band topology in this new class of unconventional topological semimetals, even when spin&#8208;orbit coupling is negligible. A nontrivial orbital&#8208;momentum locking of multifold chiral fermions in the bulk leads to a pronounced OAM texture of the helicoid Fermi arcs at the surface. The study highlights the pivotal role of the orbital degree of freedom for the chirality and topology of electron states, in general, and paves the way towards the application of topological chiral semimetals in orbitronic&#160;devices.

In quantum materials, the chirality of fermions, given by the relative directions between the electron spin and momentum, is connected to the band topology of electronic states. This study shows that in structurally chiral materials like CoSi, the orbital angular momentum (OAM) serves as the main driver of a nontrivial band topology in this new class of unconventional topological semimetals, even when spin-orbit coupling is negligible. A nontrivial orbital-momentum locking of multifold chiral fermions in the bulk leads to a pronounced OAM texture of the helicoid Fermi arcs at the surface. The study highlights the pivotal role of the orbital degree of freedom for the chirality and topology of electron states, in general, and paves the way towards the application of topological chiral semimetals in orbitronic&#160;devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluorine Engineering Induces Phase Transformation in NiCo2O4 for Enhanced Active Motifs Formation in Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precisely manipulating the reconstruction process to generate specific active motifs remains challenging during the alkaline OER. NiCo2O4&#8208;Fn, structured with NiCo2O4 cores and (NH4)NixCo1&#8722;xF3 shells, facilitate the dual&#8208;metal NiCoOOH active phase with Ov forming at a lower voltage than the single&#8208;metal NiOOH in NiCo2O4, which is demonstrated by in situ Raman and XAFS. The NiCoOOH generation is attributed to the transformation of (NH4)NixCo1&#8722;xF3 into NixCo1&#8722;x(OH)2 hydroxide in electrolyte without bias. Consequently, NiCo2O4&#8208;Fn exhibits enhanced OER intrinsic activities compared to NiCo2O4.









Abstract
Dynamic reconstruction of catalysts is key to active site formation in alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but precise control over this process remains challenging. Herein, F&#8208;doped NiCo2O4 (NiCo2O4&#8208;Fn), consisting of a NiCo2O4 core and a (NH4)NixCo1&#8722;xF3 shell is reported, which promotes the formation of a dual&#8208;metal NiCoOOH active phase. In situ Raman and X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analyses reveal that the NiCoOOH, rich in oxygen vacancies (Ov), forms at 1.2&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for NiCo2O4&#8208;F1, in contrast to the NiOOH phase formation at 1.4&#160;V versus RHE for undoped NiCo2O4. This is facilitated by the transformation of (NH4)NixCo1&#8722;xF3 into amorphous NixCo1&#8722;x(OH)2 in the KOH electrolyte without bias. Electrochemical tests show that NiCo2O4&#8208;F1 exhibits a 14&#8208;fold increase in intrinsic activity compared to NiCo2O4. Theoretical calculations suggest that Ov&#8208;induced unsaturated Co and Ni sites enhance electroactivity by promoting *OH intermediates adsorption and conversion, lowering the OER energy barrier. The oriented control of NiCoOOH active motifs in NiCo2O4 spinel, achieved through fluorine engineering, paves a new avenue for designing efficient OER electrocatalysts.

         <title>Nanoscale Inhomogeneity and Epitaxial Strain Control Metallicity in Single Crystalline Thin Films of High Entropy Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the complex interplay between local structure and physical properties is a key challenge in high entropy oxide (HEO) research, particularly concerning electronic transport. This work demonstrates the profound influence of local chemical inhomogeneity and underlying epitaxial strain on the electronic transport properties of HEO thin film with perovskite structure, paving pathways to tailor electronic properties in high&#8208;entropy regime.








Abstract
Understanding the electronic transport properties of thin films of high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO), having multiple elements at the same crystallographic site, is crucial for their potential electronic applications. However, very little is known about the metallic phase of HEOs even in bulk form. This work delves into the interplay between global and local structural distortion and electronic properties of single crystalline thin films of (La0.2Pr0.2Nd0.2Sm0.2Eu0.2)NiO3, which exhibit metal&#8208;insulator transition under tensile strain. Employing electron microscopy and elemental resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy, we provide direct evidence of nanoscale chemical inhomogeneities at the rare&#8208;earth site, leading to a broad distribution of Ni&#8211;O&#8211;Ni bond angles. However, the octahedral rotation pattern remains the same throughout. The metallic phase consists of insulating patches with more distorted Ni&#8211;O&#8211;Ni bond angles, responsible for higher resistance exponents with increased compositional complexity. Moreover, a rare, fully metallic state of HEO thin film is achieved under compressive strain. We further demonstrate a direct correlation between the suppression of the insulating behavior and increased electronic hopping. Our findings provide a foundation for exploring Mott&#8208;Anderson electron localization physics in the high&#8208;entropy&#160;regime.

         <title>Rational Ligand Design of Conjugated Coordination Polymers for Efficient and Selective Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conjugated coordination polymer (CoN4&#8208;pyrr) of single&#8208;atom cobalt coordinated with the nitrogen atom of pyrrole ligand can work as an electrocatalyst for efficient and selective nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction to ammonia (NH3), where a fast transfer of hydrogen (*H) radicals is induced to accelerate the hydrogenation kinetics of *NO intermediate on the cobalt active site of CoN4&#8208;pyrr at the rate&#8208;determining step.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia (NRA) offers an attractive route for converting nitrate pollutants to ammonia under mild conditions. Among other catalysts, single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with high metal&#8208;atom&#8208;utilization efficiency and low&#8208;coordinated metal sites hold immense potential to be extensively applied, which unfortunately encounter a formidable challenge to obtain simultaneous improvement of NRA activity and selectivity. Here, a novel and general strategy is reported to achieve efficient and selective NRA catalysis on conjugated coordination polymers featuring with high&#8208;density and well&#8208;defined nitrogen (N)&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;atom metal sites via precise regulation of N&#8209;heterocyclic ligands toward accelerating the hydrogenation kinetics necessitated in the NRA pathway. Taking cobalt (Co) as an example, two CoN4&#8208;centered conjugated coordination polymer electrocatalysts (CoN4&#8208;pyrr and CoN4&#8208;pyri) are synthesized with pyrrole and pyridine ligands are investigated as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study. As revealed, the CoN4&#8208;pyrr can markedly outperform the CoN4&#8208;pyri toward NRA electrocatalysis. Experimental and theoretical results suggest that, relative to the N atoms of pyridine ligand in CoN4&#8208;pyri, the N atoms of pyrrole ligand in CoN4&#8208;pyrr can enable a faster transfer of hydrogen radicals to the Co active sites for accelerating the hydrogenation kinetics of *NO intermediate at the rate&#8208;determining step of NRA pathway.

         <title>High&#8208;Oriented SnO2 Nanocrystals for Air&#8208;Processed Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells with an Efficiency of 23.87%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>

DAC&#8208;AA into SnO2 colloids favors the crystalline phase and preferential orientation along high&#8208;oriented (101) and (200) crystal planes by reducing surface absorption energy and modulating crystal thermodynamics, promoting heating transfer rate in the flexible PEN substrate and favoring perovskite/SnO2 lattice matching. The f&#8208;PSCs fabricated in full&#8208;air conditions produce an efficiency of 23.87% and exceptional mechanical stability.








Abstract
Tin (IV) oxide (SnO2) electron transport layer (ETL) emerges as the most promising n&#8208;type semiconductor material for flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs). The (110) facet&#8208;dominated SnO2 colloids are readily created, whereas other best&#8208;performing (101) and (200) facets&#8208;dominated ones with superior potential in interface modulation and lattice matching remain insufficiently explored. Here water&#8208;soluble acryloyloxyethyltrimethyl ammonium chloride&#8208;acrylamine (DAC&#8208;AA) doping into SnO2 colloids produces more (101)&#8208; and (200)&#8208;oriented crystal domains through lowering surface absorption energy and offering additional thermodynamic driving force. Theoretical and experimental analyses corroborate that the grain preference orientation induced by DAC&#8208;AA modification strengthens heating transfer rate on the flexible substrate and favors lattice matching of perovskite (100) plane on SnO2 (101) and (200) facets. Accordingly, the champion f&#8208;PSCs on high&#8208;oriented SnO2&#8208;DAC&#8208;AA ETLs fabricated fully in ambient air conditions achieve the efficiencies of 23.87% and 22.41% with aperture areas of 0.092 and 1 cm2. In parallel, the propitious interfacial lattice arrangement attenuates the formation of micro&#8208;strain inside perovskite films, maintaining 92.5% of their initial performance after 10&#160;000 bending cycles with a curvature radius of 6&#160;mm.

         <title>Scalable Lithium Niobate Nanoimprinting for Nonlinear Metalenses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A broadband polycrystalline lithium niobate platform is developed for highly versatile and scalable fabrication of nonlinear metasurfaces. This work demonstrates simultaneous second harmonic generation and wavefront&#8208;shaping via a metalens on this platform. The high effective optical nonlinearity enables broadband frequency doubled light focusing for power density enhancement from near&#8208;ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared spectral range.








Abstract
Miniaturizing nonlinear optical components is essential for integrating advanced light manipulation into compact photonic devices, enabling scalable and cost&#8208;effective applications. While monocrystalline lithium niobate thin films advance nonlinear nanophotonics, their high inertness limits the design of top&#8208;down fabricated nanostructures. A versatile bottom&#8208;up fabrication method based on nanoimprint lithography is presented for achieving polycrystalline lithium niobate nanostructures and demonstrate its significant potential for nonlinear metasurfaces. The fabrication enables nearly vertical features and aspect ratios of up to 6 combined, which we combine with a novel solution&#8208;derived material with high effective second&#8208;order nonlinearity deff of 5&#160;pm&#160;V&#8722;1. On this platform, second&#8208;harmonic focusing is demonstrated over a broad spectral range from near&#8208;ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared, increasing the nonlinear signal intensity by up to 34 times. This method enables the first lithium niobate metalens and expands the field of nonlinear metasurfaces by providing a low&#8208;cost, highly scalable fabrication method for engineered nonlinear&#160;nanostructures.

         <title>Hybrid Additive Manufacturing of Shear&#8208;Stiffening Elastomer Composites for Enhanced Mechanical Properties and Intelligent Wearable Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve anisotropic structural design of shear stiffening materials, a novel hybrid additive manufacturing strategy is proposed to create a lattice&#8208;structured soft&#8208;hard phase elastomer composite (TPR&#8208;SSE composite) with enhanced mechanical properties. Based on this, an intelligent sports shoe is developed, demonstrating the potential application of the TPR&#8208;SSE composite material in wearable smart protective equipment.








Abstract
Shear&#8208;stiffening materials, renowned for their rate&#8208;dependent behavior, hold immense potential for impact&#8208;resistant applications but are often constrained by limited load&#8208;bearing capacity under extreme conditions. In this study, a novel hybrid additive manufacturing strategy that successfully achieves anisotropic structural design of shear&#8208;stiffening materials is proposed. In this strategy, fused deposition modeling (FDM) is synergistically combined with direct ink writing (DIW) to fabricate lattice&#8208;structured soft&#8208;hard phase elastomer composites (TPR&#8208;SSE composites) with enhanced mechanical properties. Through quasistatic characterization and dynamic impact experiments, complemented by noncontact optical measurement and finite element simulation, the mechanical enhancement mechanisms imparted by the lattice architecture are systematically uncovered. The resulting composites exhibit exceptional load&#8208;bearing capacity under quasistatic conditions and superior energy dissipation under dynamic impacts, making them ideal for advanced protective systems. Building on this, smart sports shoes featuring a deep&#8208;learning&#8208;based smart sensing module that integrates structural customizability, buffering capacity, and gait recognition, are developed. This work provides a transformative structure design approach to shear&#8208;stiffening materials systems, paving the way for next&#8208;generation intelligent wearable protection applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Integrated Micro&#8208;Vortex Air Filter Enabled With Honeycomb&#8208;Like Structured Nanofibrous Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cellular cell micro&#8208;vortex air filter constructed by 3D honeycomb&#8208;like structured nano&#8208;networks is created by a unique electro&#8208;netting&#8208;assembly technique. Due to the micro&#8208;vortex cascade filtration mode of cellular cells, 3D porous cell walls (average pore size &#8776;410 nm) consisting of nano&#8208;scaled fibers (diameter 45 nm), enhanced air slip effect, our filters achieve high&#8208;efficiency and low&#8208;resistance PM0.3 removal, desirable dust holding capacity and remarkable biodegradibility.








Abstract
Particulate matter (PM) pollution has posed a serious threat to public health, especially with the outbreak of respiratory infections. However, most existing fiber filters face an inevitable trade&#8208;off between removal efficiency and air resistance, due to their thick fibers and uncontrolled flat stacking structure. Herein, a unique high&#8208;performance integrated micro&#8208;vortex filter is created using honeycomb&#8208;like structured cellular nanofibrous networks via the innovative electro&#8208;netting&#8208;assembly nanotechnique for air filtration. Manipulation of the ejection, deformation, and self&#8208;assembly of the charged droplets from the Taylor cone enables the one&#8208;step construction of 3D cellular cells with 2D nano architectured networks consisted of 1D nanowires with a diameter of &#8776;45&#160;nm on a large&#8208;scale. The resultant micro&#8208;vortex air filter, functioned as an integrated filter system, achieved a remarkable air slip effect and striking micro&#8208;vortex cascade filtration mode, showing &gt;99.97% PM0.3 removal, &#8776;0.12% atmosphere pressure of air resistance, 27&#160;g m&#8722;2 dust holding, along with robust mechanical stability. This work may provide a promising avenue for the design and development of novel separation and purification materials.

         <title>Screening Natural Cholesterol Analogs to Assemble Self&#8208;Adjuvant Lipid Nanoparticles for Antigens Tagging Guided Therapeutic Tumor Vaccine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cholesterol analogs ginsenosides&#8208;Rg3 are screened to assemble lipid nanoparticles, which can deliver nucleic acid antigens to tumors and lymph nodes for antigens tagging tumor cells and dendritic cells activation, thus guiding CTL to accurately recognize and kill tumor cells. Besides, ginsenosides&#8208;Rg3 can reshape tumor microenvironment by inhibiting STAT3. Collectively, this work has great clinical value for immune&#8208;escaping tumors.








Abstract
The clinical progress of tumor nucleotide vaccines is limited due to insufficient recognition and killing of tumor cells with low antigen expression by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Here, natural cholesterol analogs are screened to assemble self&#8208;adjuvant lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for antigens tagging tumor cells and dendritic cells (DC) activation. First, a library of ginsenosides are collected, and then screened according to their anti&#8208;tumor immunity. Then, ginsenoside&#8208;Rg3 based&#8208;LNPs loaded with antigens (Rg3&#8208;LNPs) are identified as the optimal formulation by investigating the physicochemical and biological properties. Finally, Rg3&#8208;LNPs and granulocyte&#8208;macrophage colony&#8208;stimulating factor (GM&#8208;CSF) are co&#8208;loaded into a macroporous hydrogel for long&#8208;term immune response. Rg3&#8208;LNPs could accumulate into both tumors and LNs. Rg3&#8208;LNPs targeted tumor cells with high glucose transporter&#8208;1 expression via the targeting ligand Rg3, and anchored antigens on the tumor cell surface, thus promoting the recognition of CTL to tumor cells; Rg3&#8208;LNPs can accumulate into the LNs to promote DC activation and antigen presentation, thus stimulating CTL activation. Besides, Rg3, as an adjuvant, cooperated with GM&#8208;CSF to remodel the tumor microenvironment, thus promoting the killing of CTL to tumor cells. Collectively, this work highlights the importance of tagging antigens to tumor cells in tumor vaccine and has great clinical value for immune&#8208;escaping tumors.

&lt;p&gt;Cholesterol analogs ginsenosides-Rg3 are screened to assemble lipid nanoparticles, which can deliver nucleic acid antigens to tumors and lymph nodes for antigens tagging tumor cells and dendritic cells activation, thus guiding CTL to accurately recognize and kill tumor cells. Besides, ginsenosides-Rg3 can reshape tumor microenvironment by inhibiting STAT3. Collectively, this work has great clinical value for immune-escaping tumors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clinical progress of tumor nucleotide vaccines is limited due to insufficient recognition and killing of tumor cells with low antigen expression by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Here, natural cholesterol analogs are screened to assemble self-adjuvant lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for antigens tagging tumor cells and dendritic cells (DC) activation. First, a library of ginsenosides are collected, and then screened according to their anti-tumor immunity. Then, ginsenoside-Rg3 based-LNPs loaded with antigens (Rg3-LNPs) are identified as the optimal formulation by investigating the physicochemical and biological properties. Finally, Rg3-LNPs and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are co-loaded into a macroporous hydrogel for long-term immune response. Rg3-LNPs could accumulate into both tumors and LNs. Rg3-LNPs targeted tumor cells with high glucose transporter-1 expression via the targeting ligand Rg3, and anchored antigens on the tumor cell surface, thus promoting the recognition of CTL to tumor cells; Rg3-LNPs can accumulate into the LNs to promote DC activation and antigen presentation, thus stimulating CTL activation. Besides, Rg3, as an adjuvant, cooperated with GM-CSF to remodel the tumor microenvironment, thus promoting the killing of CTL to tumor cells. Collectively, this work highlights the importance of tagging antigens to tumor cells in tumor vaccine and has great clinical value for immune-escaping tumors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Relaxor Antiferroelectric Dynamics for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel 2D relaxor antiferroelectric (AFE) material CuBiP2Se6 (CBPS)&#160;showcases unique AFE and optoelectronic properties. These properties enable CBPS devices to mimic synaptic plasticity through reversible polarization switching under electrical stimuli. Moreover, they can replicate key characteristics of biological synapses in response to optical stimuli, paving the way for in&#8208;sensor computing applications such as image restoration.








Abstract
Relaxor antiferroelectric (AFE) materials display a gradual polarization response and high energy storage density with polarization slowly reverting after removing an external field. This distinctive polarization&#8208;switching behavior closely resembles synaptic plasticity in biological nervous systems, presenting substantial potential for neuromorphic computing applications. Especially, its 2D scenario exhibits unique physical properties and maintains stability at atomic thickness due to their antipolar alignment, which effectively eliminates the depolarization field effect. Such stable 2D relaxor AFE materials offer significant advantages for integrating these materials into modern electronic devices for neuromorphic computing. In this study, the potential of a novel quaternary layered AFE material, CuBiP&#8322;Se&#8326; (CBPS), is explored for neuromorphic device applications. CBPS exhibits a broad range of light absorption and stable relaxor AFE behavior, rendering it an outstanding candidate for optoelectronic synaptic devices. High&#8208;quality CBPS is synthesized and its AFE properties through various characterization techniques are verified. CBPS&#8208;based synaptic devices demonstrate dual&#8208;mode tunable resistance plasticity stimulated by both electrical and optical inputs, demonstrating the capacity to perform in&#8208;sensor computing for image restoration tasks. These findings suggest that relaxor AFE materials like CBPS could provide a robust platform for various brain&#8208;inspired applications, particularly in neuromorphic computing, and artificial visual systems.

         <title>Neuromorphic Transistors Integrating Photo&#8208;Sensor, Optical Memory and Visual Synapses for Artificial Vision Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a neuromorphic transistor integrating sensing, memory, and computing in one device to address the challenges of commercial artificial vision system. By varying top gate voltages, it can operate as an ultrasensitive photo&#8208;sensor (&#8776;6.515 kA W&#8722;1), a non&#8208;volatile multi&#8208;level optical memory (&gt;4 bits), and a neuromorphic visual synapse with 95.26% image recognition accuracy by combing artificial neural network model.








Abstract
In commercial artificial vision system (AVS), the sensing, storage, and computing units are usually physically separated due to their architecture and performance gaps, which thus increases the volume, complexity, and energy loss. This work develops a neuromorphic transistor integrating these different modules within one single device. Leveraging the gate&#8208;tunable out&#8208;of&#8208;plane electric field, the device achieves the multi&#8208;mode integration of photo&#8208;sensor, optical memory, and visual synapse. When operating at negative top gate voltage (VTG), a strong photo&#8208;gating effect enables highly sensitive photo&#8208;response with responsivity of &#8776;6.515 kA W&#8722;1 and detectivity up to &#8776;3.92 &#215; 1014 Jones. Due to the charge storage effect, it can also act as a non&#8208;volatile multi&#8208;level (&gt;4 bits) optical memory with a long endurance of over 10&#160;000 s and a high writing/erasing ratio of up to 106. At zero or positive VTG, the transistor switches to visual synapse mode with neuromorphic computing capability, providing a pathway for complex biological learning and flexible synaptic plasticity. By further combining the synaptic plasticity with an artificial neural network (ANN), it achieves precise image recognition and classification with an accuracy of up to 95.26%. This work develops a multi&#8208;mode transistor that integrates key components of an AVS, addressing the existing challenges of all&#8208;in&#8208;one integration and manufacturing complexity.

         <title>A Core&#8208;Shell Perovskite Composite Air Electrode With Thermal&#8208;Expansion Offset and Mechanical Support Functions for Highly Durable Reversible Protonic Ceramic Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8208;shell perovskite composite with a highly durable electrochemical activity for oxygen catalysis is developed as an air electrode for reversible protonic ceramic cells (RPCCs) via a unique solid&#8208;state reaction. This work also demonstrates a new pathway to developing highly durable air electrode materials for RPCCs technology, accelerating RPCCs&#8217; commercialization.








Abstract
Reversible protonic ceramic cells (RPCCs) offer a promising pathway to efficient and reversible energy conversion, accelerating the global shift to renewables. However, the RPCCs&#8217; commercialization faces limitations in air electrode materials. Traditional cobalt&#8208;based perovskite air electrodes, while effective, suffer from high cost and environmental concerns. Alternative materials, such as SrFeO3&#8208;&#948; (SF)&#8208;based perovskites, offer potential, yet durability issues, including thermal&#8208;expansion mismatch and mechanical instability, hinder their practical application. Here, a unique solid&#8208;state reaction between SF and negative&#8208;thermal&#8208;expansion (NTE) material is demonstrated to yield a core&#8208;shell perovskite composite as a highly durable RPCCs air electrode. Specifically, by calcining a mixture of SF and an NTE material, ZrW2O8 (ZWO), the in situ incorporation of ZWO into the SF lattice is achieved, resulting in a non&#8208;closed core&#8208;shell composite, comprising single perovskite SraFebZrcWdO3&#8208;&#948; (SP&#8208;SFZW) core and B&#8208;site cation ordered double perovskite SrxFeyZrmWnO6&#8208;&#948; (DP&#8208;SFZW) shell. Both SP&#8208;SFZW and DP&#8208;SFZW serve as oxygen catalysts, while DP&#8208;SFZW shell additionally acts as a thermal expansion suppressor and mechanical support structure, effectively mitigating electrode cracking and delamination from other cell components during RPCC operation. Consequently, the composite electrode demonstrates comparable catalytic activity to SF, coupled with significantly enhanced durability. This work illustrates a novel approach for developing robust RPCCs air electrode.

         <title>Structured Light Projection Using Image Guide Fibers for In Situ Photo&#8208;biofabrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;based biofabrication is typically performed with single wavelength light sources and within benchtop devices. This work demonstrates FaSt&#8208;Light (Fiber&#8208;assisted Structured Light) as a new approach to achieve multiwavelength image projection using flexible image guide fibers, which enables a variety of applications for in situ biofabrication.








Abstract
Light&#8208;based biofabrication techniques have revolutionized the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Specifically, the projection of structured light, where the spatial distribution of light is controlled at both macro and microscale, has enabled precise fabrication of complex three dimensional&#160;structures with high resolution and speed. However, despite tremendous progress, biofabrication processes are mostly limited to benchtop devices which limit the flexibility in terms of where the fabrication can occur. Here, a Fiber&#8208;assisted Structured Light (FaSt&#8208;Light) projection apparatus for rapid in situ crosslinking of photoresins is demonstrated. This approach uses image&#8208;guide fiber bundles which can project bespoke images at multiple wavelengths, enabling flexibility and spatial control of different photoinitiation systems and crosslinking chemistries and also the location of fabrication. Coupling of different sizes of fibers and different lenses attached to the fibers to project small (several mm) or large (several cm) images for material crosslinking is demonstrated. FaSt&#8208;Light allows control over the cross&#8208;section of the crosslinked resins and enables the introduction of microfilaments which can further guide cellular infiltration, differentiation, and anisotropic matrix production. The proposed approach can lead to a new range of in situ biofabrication techniques which improve the translational potential of photofabricated tissues and grafts.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light-based biofabrication techniques have revolutionized the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Specifically, the projection of structured light, where the spatial distribution of light is controlled at both macro and microscale, has enabled precise fabrication of complex three dimensional&#160;structures with high resolution and speed. However, despite tremendous progress, biofabrication processes are mostly limited to benchtop devices which limit the flexibility in terms of where the fabrication can occur. Here, a Fiber-assisted Structured Light (FaSt-Light) projection apparatus for rapid in situ crosslinking of photoresins is demonstrated. This approach uses image-guide fiber bundles which can project bespoke images at multiple wavelengths, enabling flexibility and spatial control of different photoinitiation systems and crosslinking chemistries and also the location of fabrication. Coupling of different sizes of fibers and different lenses attached to the fibers to project small (several mm) or large (several cm) images for material crosslinking is demonstrated. FaSt-Light allows control over the cross-section of the crosslinked resins and enables the introduction of microfilaments which can further guide cellular infiltration, differentiation, and anisotropic matrix production. The proposed approach can lead to a new range of in situ biofabrication techniques which improve the translational potential of photofabricated tissues and grafts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Deep Learning Empowered Parallelized Metasurface Computed Tomography Snapshot Spectral Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Snapshot spectral imaging faces challenges in miniaturization due to cascading optics. Here, an ultracompact parallelized metasurface tomography spectral imaging system synergized with generative deep learning is presented. Parallel sub&#8208;metasurfaces capture multi&#8208;angle spectral projections, while a trained adversarial network reconstructs spectral images with high resolution in milliseconds. This sub&#8208;mm3&#8208;scale innovation enables endoscopic/microscopic integration, promising to transform real&#8208;time biomedical diagnostics.









Abstract
Snapshot spectral imaging is an emerging technology for fast data acquisition in dynamic environments, capturing high&#8208;volume spatial&#8208;spectral information in a single snapshot. However, it suffers from bulky cascading optics and cannot be directly used in space&#8208;restricted scenarios such as endoscope&#8208;assisted brain microsurgery and real&#8208;time cellular tissue imaging. In this work, an ultracompact strategy of parallelized metasurface computed tomography empowered by generative deep learning is proposed, which can effectively reduce the optics volume in snapshot spectral imaging from cm3 scale to sub&#8208;mm3 scale while retaining high resolution and speed of imaging so that the above&#8208;mentioned pain point problem is well addressed. The system comprises seven multifunctional sub&#8208;metasurfaces simultaneously acquiring multi&#8208;angle spectral projection and integration information of the target, uses the system&#8208;calibrated point spread functions as wavelength and spatial position distributions, and incorporates a generative adversarial deep neural network for fast reconstruction of spatial&#8208;spectral multiplexed images. Experimental results show that single snapshot imaging can be achieved in 38&#160;ms with a spectral resolution of 10&#160;nm in the spectral range of 450&#8211;650&#160;nm. This technique paves the way for snapshot spectral imaging integration into various highly miniaturized microscopy and endoscopic imaging systems in applications such as advanced medical diagnosis.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature High&#8208;Voltage Thermal Charging Cells Enabled by Ca&#8211;Li Dual&#8208;Cationic Ionic Liquid Electrolytes and Anionophilic Separators</title>

         <dc:description>
Practical high&#8208;temperature high&#8208;voltage thermal charging cells, incorporating heat&#8208;resistant Ca&#8211;Li salt, C4mimAOT&#8208;AmimCl co&#8208;solvent, and PEN@ZrBDC&#8208;F&#8208;4% separators, are successfully developed. These advancements are attributed to enhanced energy storage of dual carriers, improved diffusion kinetics facilitated by the AmimCl solvent and optimized carrier mobility enabled by the anionophilic properties of ZrBDC. The research holds significant promise for high&#8208;temperature, high&#8208;performance waste heat harvesting.








Abstract
Thermoelectric technologies (TEs) offer immense potential for waste heat recovery and energy storage. However, the practical application of current TEs has been severely hampered by potential performance degradation in extreme environments, particularly at high temperatures, due to electrolyte flammability or poor carrier mobility. The development of high&#8208;temperature, high&#8208;performance TEs is crucial for broadening their operational range and enabling diverse applications. Here, practical high&#8208;temperature high&#8208;voltage thermal charging cells (HHTCCs) are reported, facilitated by a heat&#8208;resistant trifluoromethanesulfonate&#8208;based Ca&#8211;Li dual&#8208;cationic ionic liquid electrolyte containing functionalized AmimCl solvent, together with a thermotolerant composite membrane, PEN(polyphenylene&#8208;ether&#8208;nitrile)@ZrBDC&#8208;F&#8208;4%. The dual&#8208;cation mechanism enables high thermal voltage through cooperative energy storage, while the functionalized AmimCl accelerates the mobility of Ca2+ and Li+ ions by weakening the surrounding shielding effect. Additionally, the anionophilic ZrBDC&#8208;F&#8208;4% nanoparticles in the composite membrane enhance carrier migration. As a result, the HHTCCs exhibit an impressive thermal voltage of 1.138 V, a remarkable thermopower of 15.3 mV K&#8722;1, and an outstanding Carnot&#8208;relative efficiency of 9.56% over an unprecedented temperature range from 328.15 to 393.15 K, demonstrating the excellent safety and feasibility of HHTCCs. This work expands the service&#8208;temperature range of i&#8208;TEs, holding significant promise for high&#8208;temperature, high&#8208;performance waste heat harvesting.

         <title>Inhalable Ce Nanozyme&#8208;Backpacked Phage Aims at Ischemic Cerebral Injury by M1&#8208;Microglia Hitchhiking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study developed a bio&#8208;active, inhalable nanozyme&#8208;backpacked M13 phage (CZM) which specifically delivers to the ischemic core via the olfactory bulb pathway. Leveraging M1&#8208;microglia hitchhiking, CZM accumulates specifically at the lesion site, scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) to mitigate neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis, providing a safe and effective strategy for the precise treatment of neuroinflammatory disorders.








Abstract
There is a desperate need for precise nanomedications to treat ischemic cerebral injury. Yet, the drawbacks of poor delivery efficiency and off&#8208;target toxicity in pathologic parenchyma for traditional antioxidants against ischemic stroke result in inadequate brain accumulation. M13 bacteriophages are highly phagocytosed by M1&#8208;polarized microglia and can be carried toward the neuroinflammatory sites. Here, a bio&#8208;active, inhalable, Ce0.9Zr0.1O2&#8208;backpacked&#8208;M13 phage (abbreviated as CZM) is developed and demonstrates how M13 bacteriophages are taken up by different phenotypes&#8217; microglia. With the M1 microglia's proliferating and migrating, CZM can be extensively and specifically delivered to the site of the ischemic core and penumbra, where the surviving nerve cells need to be shielded from secondary oxidative stress and inflammatory cascade initiated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). With non&#8208;invasive administration, CZM effectively alleviates oxidative damage and apoptosis of neurons by eliminating ROS generated by hyperactive M1&#8208;polarized microglia. Here, a secure and effective strategy for the targeted therapy of neuroinflammatory maladies is offered by this research.

         <title>Inverse Opal Photonic Crystal Structured Bifacial&#8208;Iridescent Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel bifacial&#8208;iridescent solar cell is developed using an inverse opal perovskite photonic crystal. It exhibited unique iridescent structural colors on both sides and achieved an impressive bifacial equivalent efficiency of 18.00% for small cells and 12.77% for mini&#8208;modules.








Abstract
Colorful perovskite solar cells exhibit excellent potential for building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs), which increase the utilization of clean power. However, their efficiencies are lower than those of uncolored devices. Moreover, traditional mono&#8208;facial colored devices cannot satisfy diverse BIPV scenarios. Here a bifacial iridescent solar cell (BFI&#8208;SC) is developed,&#160;constructed by inverse opal (IO) perovskite photonic crystals and transparent front and rear electrodes. The developed BFI&#8208;SC exhibited bright vivid colors on both sides, which originate from the reflection at the photonic stop band of the IO perovskite photonic crystal. Moreover, this unique IO photonic crystal decreased the interfacial Fresnel reflection and generated a slow&#8208;photon effect, which increases the material light absorption and utilization to obtain high efficiency. Furthermore, the BFI&#8208;SC can harvest light from both sides, considerably enhancing the device efficiency. Thus, the BFI&#8208;SC achieved an impressive bifacial equivalent efficiency (&#951;eq) of 18.00%, which is the highest value achieved for the reported multicolored (or iridescent) solar cell. A larger&#8208;scale BFI&#8208;SC module is successfully assembled, achieving a champion &#951;eq of 12.77%. In addition, another perovskite material with an IO structure and wide&#8208;bandgap components exhibited vivid colors on both sides, indicating the universality of this coloring strategy and its independence of the perovskite components.

         <title>Octopus Tentacle&#8208;Inspired In&#8208;Sensor Adaptive Integral for Edge&#8208;Intelligent Touch Intention Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the octopus cerebellum on its tentacles, a reconfigurable and adaptive intelligent touch sensor is proposed. It epitomizes touch strategic innovation by integrating a geometric progression structure that not only enhances deformability but also embeds an integral in&#8208;sensing mechanism. The work provides ground&#8208;breaking insight into the in&#8208;sensor computing and adaptive structure design strategies for advancing deformable multitouch electronics.








Abstract
Electronics continue to drive technological innovation and diversified applications. To ensure efficiency and effectiveness across various interactive contexts, the ability to adjust operating functions or parameters according to environmental shifts or user requirements is highly desirable. However, due to the inherent limitations of nonadaptive device structures and materials, the current development of touch electronics faces challenges, e.g., limited hardware resources, poor adaptability, weak deformation stability, and bottlenecks in sensing data processing. Here, a reconfigurable and adaptive intelligent (RAI) touch sensor is proposed, inspired by octopus's tentacle cognitive behavior. It realizes remarkable deformability and highly efficient multitouch interactions. The geometric progression structure of the sensing element equips the RAI touch sensor with a unique integrated&#8208;in&#8208;sensing mechanism and programmable logic. This greatly compresses sensing data dimensionality at the edge, yielding concise and undistorted interactive signals. By leveraging the advantages of hard&#8208;soft bonding and interface modulation of functional materials, the adaptability is achieved with a 200% strain range a 180&#176; twist tolerance, and exceptional deformation stability of &gt;10&#160;000 cycles. The diverse application&#8208;specific configurations of the RAI touch sensor, enable a dynamic intention recognition accuracy of over 99%, advancing next&#8208;generation Internet of Things and edge computing research and innovation.

         <title>A Simple Optical Convolution Strategy Based on Versatile Adjustable Optical Convolution Kernel for All&#8208;Optical Convolution Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel optical convolution strategy leveraging continuously adjustable photoluminescent device (CA&#8208;PLD) as convolution kernel is proposed for all&#8208;optical computing. Under ultraviolet illumination, the CA&#8208;PLD array successfully demonstrates parallel and highly efficient multiply&#8208;accumulate operations. The system achieves convolution computing in a non&#8208;von Neumann architecture, exhibiting structural simplicity, high computational efficiency, and powerful image processing and segmentation capabilities.








Abstract
Convolutional neural network (CNN) is currently one of the most important artificial neural networks. However, traditional CNN hardware architectures suffer from significant increases in energy consumption and processing time as the demand for artificial intelligence tasks grows. Here, a novel optical convolution computing strategy is proposed that leverages a continuously adjustable photoluminescent device (CA&#8208;PLD) as the optical convolution kernel, enabling parallel, all&#8208;optical convolution computing and greatly simplifying the traditional convolution process. Under ultraviolet illumination, the CA&#8208;PLD exhibits visible long&#8208;afterglow emission characteristics due to the charge trapping and retention effects. This allows for continuously adjustable light weights, facilitating arbitrary convolution operations. Building on this, parallel and efficient multiply&#8208;accumulate operations have been successfully demonstrated using CA&#8208;PLD arrays with different weight combinations. Moreover, space&#8208;transformable CA&#8208;PLD units enable applications in dilated convolution. In a semantic segmentation task with 20 categories, the CA&#8208;PLD units achieve higher Intersection over Union (IoU) values and accuracy. Therefore, the weight&#8208;adjustable and spatial transformable CA&#8208;PLD proposed in this work holds promise for future applications in intelligent optical computing systems and optical implementations of non&#8208;von Neumann architectures.

         <title>Stable and Ultrasensitive X&#8208;Ray Detectors Based on Oriented Single&#8208;Crystal Perovskite Rods</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large high&#8208;quality perovskite FAPbI3 SC single crystal rods (SCRs) with unique orientation are grown using a biomass&#8208;derived green solvent. The oriented FAPbI3 SCR shows high carrier mobility and large bulk resistivity. Therefore, the SC detectors realize record high X&#8208;ray detection sensitivity (2.16 &#215; 105 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) and high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging at a low dose rate of 12 nGy s&#8722;1.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;halide perovskite single crystals (SCs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation X&#8208;ray detectors. X&#8208;ray detectors fabricated using perovskite FAPbI3 SCs exhibit high detection sensitivity. However, two pressing issues still need to be addressed for practical applications: the orientation&#8208;controlled growth and environmentally friendly acquisition of high&#8208;quality FAPbI3 SCs. In this study, large high&#8208;quality perovskite FAPbI3 SC rods (SCRs) with unique orientation are grown using a biomass&#8208;derived green solvent. Owing to the high carrier mobility and large bulk resistivity of the oriented FAPbI3 SCRs, the SC detectors realize a record high X&#8208;ray detection sensitivity (2.16 &#215; 105 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) and high sensitivity to dark current density ratio (1.93 &#215; 109&#160;Gy&#8722;1 s). Furthermore, the detectors exhibit both ultralow dark and X&#8208;ray current drifts, as well as a detection limit of 2 nGy s&#8722;1. These characteristics enable the detectors to achieve high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging, even at dose rates as low as 12 nGy s&#8722;1. This study not only contributes a new technical solution for low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray detection, but also establishes a new approach for the low&#8208;cost and environmentally friendly production of core materials for X&#8208;ray detectors.

         <title>Signal Converter&#8208;Based Therapy Platform Promoting Aging Bone Healing by Improving Permeability of the Mitochondrial Membrane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
GelMA microspheres integrated with polydopamine&#8208;coated gold nanorods (GMPG) respond to ultrasound stimulation, converting it into biochemical signals that stimulate senescent bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to highly express HSP70, thereby improving mitochondrial membrane permeability by inhibiting BAX activation, reducing inflammation and oxidative stress, and ultimately promoting aging bone regeneration.








Abstract
The aging microenvironment promotes persistent inflammation and loss of intrinsic regenerative capacity. These are major obstacles to effective bone tissue repair in older adults. This study aims to explore how physical thermal stimulation can effectively delay the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) aging process. Based on this, an implantable physical signal&#8208;converter platform is designed as a therapeutic system that enables stable heat signals at the bone injury site under ultrasound stimulation (US). It is found that the therapeutic platform controllably reduces the mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization of aging BMSCs, bidirectionally inhibiting mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) leakage. The leakage ratio of mtDNA decreases by 22.7%. This effectively mitigates the activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway and its downstream NF&#8208;&#954;B signaling induced by oxidative stress in aging BMSCs, thereby attenuating the pathological advancement of chronic inflammation. Thus, it effectively restores the metabolism and osteogenic differentiation of aging BMSCs in vitro, which is further confirmed in a rat model. In the GMPG/US group, the bone mineral density increases 2&#8211;3 times at 4 weeks in the rats femoral defect model. Therefore, this ultrasound&#8208;based signal&#8208;conversion platform provides a promising strategy for aging bone defect repair.

         <title>In Situ Secondary Self&#8208;Assembly of Near&#8208;Infrared II J&#8208;Aggregates: A Novel Phototheranostic Strategy for Inducing Tumor Pyroptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel near&#8208;infrared II J&#8208;aggregate&#8208;based nanomedicine has been observed to target tumor tissue and achieve effective penetration and prolonged retention in tumor tissue using an in situ secondary self&#8208;assembly strategy. These nanomedicines induce tumor pyroptosis by generating type I reactive oxygen species (superoxide anions), facilitating robust NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging and activating tumor photoimmunotherapy.








Abstract
Pyroptosis, a programmed cell death mechanism that bypasses apoptosis resistance and triggers tumor&#8208;specific immune responses, has gained much attention as a promising approach to cancer therapy. Despite enhancing tumor accumulation and extending the circulation of small&#8208;molecule drugs, nanomedicines still face significant challenges, including poor tissue penetration, tumor resistance, and hypoxic microenvironments. To overcome these challenges, a novel near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) J&#8208;aggregate&#8208;based nanomedicine is designed, leveraging an in situ secondary self&#8208;assembly strategy to fabricate highly targeted nanoparticles (MSDP NPs). These nanomedicines trigger pyroptosis by generating type I reactive oxygen species, especially superoxide anions, while simultaneously activating photoimmunotherapy. In vivo studies demonstrate that MSDP NPs achieve efficient tumor penetration and prolong tumor&#160;retention, which is facilitated by the J&#8208;aggregate&#8208;driven formation of microscale spindle&#8208;shaped fibrillar bundles through in situ secondary self&#8208;assembly at the tumor site. This unique structural transformation enhances nanomedicine accumulation in tumor tissues, enabling robust NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging and improving therapeutic efficacy even in hypoxic tumor microenvironments. This study provides an innovative phototheranostic strategy that utilizes the in situ secondary self&#8208;assembly of NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates to induce tumor pyroptosis, offering a potential solution to the limitations of current nanomedicines in cancer therapy.

         <title>Ultrahigh Conductive MXene Films for Broadband Electromagnetic Interference Shielding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new series of nitrogen&#8208;substituted MXene films, spanning the full composition range, achieves record&#8208;high conductivity (35&#8201;000 S cm&#8315;&#185;) and outstanding electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding across X, Ka, and W bands, even in ultrathin layers. These solution&#8208;processable, lightweight films outperform metals and open new possibilities for high&#8208;frequency electronics and wireless communication systems of the future.








Abstract
Broadband and ultrathin electromagnetic interference (EMI)&#8208;shielding materials are crucial for efficient high&#8208;frequency data transmission in emerging technologies. MXenes are renowned for their outstanding electrical conductivity and EMI&#8208;shielding capability. While substituting nitrogen (N) for carbon (C) atoms in the conventional MXene structure is theoretically expected to enhance these properties, synthesis challenges have hindered progress. Here, it is demonstrated that TixCyNx&#8208;y&#8208;1Tz MXene films with optimized N content achieve a record&#8208;high electrical conductivity of 35&#8201;000 S cm&#8722;1 and exceptional broadband EMI shielding across the X (8&#8211;12.4&#160;GHz), Ka (26.5&#8211;40&#160;GHz), and W (75&#8211;110&#160;GHz) bands&#8212;outperforming all previously reported materials even at reduced thicknesses. By synthesizing a full series of high&#8208;stoichiometric TixAlCyNx&#8208;y&#8208;1 MAX phases without intermediate phases, the impact of N substitution on the physical and electrical properties of TixCyNx&#8208;y&#8208;1Tz MXene flakes is systematically explored, achieving complete composition tunability in both dispersion and film forms. These findings position TixCyNx&#8208;y&#8208;1Tz MXenes as promising candidates for applications spanning from conventional lower&#8208;frequency domains to next&#8208;generation sub&#8208;THz electronics.

         <title>Reconstruction of the Buried Interface of Triple&#8208;Halide Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite for All&#8208;Perovskite Tandems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By modifying the buried interface of the triple&#8208;halide wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite (WBG) with potassium trifluoromethanesulfonate (TfOK), a graded heterojunction is formed between the buried thin layer and the bulk, thereby improving the quality of the WBG perovskite film. Ultimately, an all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cell with a PCE of 28.30% is achieved.








Abstract
All&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells (TSCs) paired by wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskites with narrow&#8208;bandgap perovskites holds the potential to overcome the Shockley&#8208;Queisser limitation. However, the severe phase segregation and non&#8208;radiative recombination of WBG perovskite put on a shadow for their power conversion efficiency and stability. Here, an interfacial engineering strategy is introduced into the triple&#8208;halide WBG perovskite. Potassium trifluoromethanesulfonate (TfOK) is utilized to reconstruct the buried interface of the triple&#8208;halide WBG perovskite. The distribution of (chlorine) Cl&#8722; changes from perovskite bulk toward the buried interface due to the TfOK addition. Therefore, a wider bandgap perovskite thin layer is formed at buried layer, which can form a graded heterojunction with bulk WBG perovskite to improve carrier separation and transfer. Meanwhile, the (potassium) K+ of TfOK diffuses into WBG perovskite bulk to suppress halide phase segregation. Consequently, the 1.78&#160;eV WBG PSCs deliver an impressive power conversion efficiency of 20.47% and an extremely high fill factor over 85%. Furthermore, the resultant two&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite TSCs achieves a champion efficiency of 28.30%. This strategy provides a unique avenue to improve performance and photostability of WBG PSCs, a new function of Cl&#8722; in triple&#8208;halide is illustrated.

         <title>Spectrally Engineered Coatings for Steering the Solar Photons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spectrum&#8208;splitting energy synergy: a spectrally engineered radiative cooling (RC) coating with photoluminescence is integrated with bifacial photovoltaic (biPV) panels to construct a hybrid biPV&#8208;RC system. By controlling solar photon conversion pathways and guiding light transport, the system enables synergistic power generation and daytime radiative cooling, offering a scalable solution for carbon&#8208;neutral buildings.








Abstract
The spectral properties of radiative cooling (RC) and photovoltaic (PV) govern their capacity to utilize solar photons at distinct energy levels. However, spectral mismatches with the solar spectrum result in significant inefficiencies: non&#8208;photovoltaic heat losses in PV panels and wasted energy from reflected solar radiation in RC systems. To address this, a photoluminescent RC coating with spectrally selective reflectivity is developed to be&#160;integrated it with bifacial photovoltaic (biPV) panels. The high reflectivity of the RC coating directs photons to the rear side of the PV panels, while its spectral selectivity optimizes the energy distribution of photons reaching the rear side, resulting in a 32% increase in the overall power output of the bifacial PV system. Additionally, the incorporation of photoluminescent materials enables the conversion of absorbed photons into luminescence rather than heat by suppressing non&#8208;radiative transitions. This reduces effective solar absorption by 14% and enhances radiative cooling performance. Simulated urban rooftop deployment demonstrates that this dual&#8208;harvesting system meet &#8776;18.1% of Hong Kong's annual electricity demand, offering a scalable pathway toward carbon&#8208;neutral cities.

         <title>Aggregation Engineering of Toluene&#8208;Processed Acceptor Layer Enables Over 19% Efficiency of Air&#8208;Blade&#8208;Coated Organic Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
To elucidate the mechanism of morphology regulation in the blade&#8208;coated active layer to obtain high efficiency, three analogous acceptors (Y6, L8&#8208;BO, and L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl) are systematically compared. Benefiting from the unique molecular packing of L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl and its weak molecule&#8208;interaction with toluene, the air&#8208;blade&#8208;coated D18/L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl&#8208;based device yields an outstanding power&#8208;conversion efficiency of 19.31%.








Abstract
Understanding the unique features of photovoltaic materials in high&#8208;performance blade&#8208;coated organic solar cells (OSCs) is critical to narrow the device performance difference between spin&#8208;coating and blade&#8208;coating methods. In this work, it is clarified that the molecular packing of acceptor and molecule&#8208;solvent interaction plays an essential role in determining the photovoltaic performance of blade&#8208;coated layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer OSCs. It is demonstrated that the unique dimer packing feature of L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl can lead to lower excited energy (&#8710;ES1) and dominant J&#8208;aggregates in the blade&#8208;coated film compared to the analogs of Y6 and L8&#8208;BO. Meanwhile, the weaker molecule&#8208;solvent interaction between L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl and toluene is in favor of forming prominent J&#8208;aggregation in blade&#8208;coated film, contributing to a&#160;more compact &#960;&#8208;stacking than Y6 and L8&#8208;BO. Additionally, the blade&#8208;coated D18/L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl film shows more defined interpenetrating networks with clearer donor&#8208;acceptor interfaces than D18/Y6 and D18/L8&#8208;BO, facilitating improved charge extraction and suppressed charge recombination. As a result, the air&#8208;blade&#8208;coated layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer device based on D18/L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl yields a remarkable power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.31% without any additive and post&#8208;treatment, while much lower PCEs of 7.01% and 16.47% are obtained in the device based on D18/Y6 and D18/L8&#8208;BO, respectively. This work offers an effective approach to developing highly efficient air&#8208;blade&#8208;coated layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer OSCs.

         <title>Creation of Independently Controllable and Long Lifetime Polar Skyrmion Textures in Ferroelectric&#8208;Metallic Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that PTO/CCMO/SRO heterostructure can hold a broad family of skyrmion&#8208;like polar textures. One can write regular skyrmion bubble patterns with a high density &#8776;300 Gbit per inch2 by local tip field. The multiple &#960;&#8208;twist target skyrmions and skyrmion bags show significant topology&#8208;enhanced stability, verifying a topology strategy to encode robust information in ferroelectrics.








Abstract
Topological textures like vortices, labyrinths, and skyrmions formed in ferroic materials have attracted extensive interest during the past decade for their fundamental physics, intriguing topology, and technological prospects. So far, polar skyrmions remain scarce in ferroelectrics as they require a delicate balance between various dipolar interactions. Here, it is reported that PbTiO3 thin films in a metallic contact undergo a topological phase transition and hold a broad family of skyrmion&#8208;like textures including Q = &#177;1 skyrmions, multiple &#960;&#8208;twist target skyrmions, and skyrmion bags, with independent controllability, analogous to those reported in magnetic systems. Weakly&#8208;interacted skyrmion arrays with a density over 300 Gbit/inch2 are successfully written, erased, and read out by local electrical and mechanical stimuli of a scanning probe. Interestingly, in contrast to the relatively short lifetime (&lt;20 hours) of the normal skyrmions, the multiple &#960;&#8208;twist target skyrmions and skyrmion bags show topology&#8208;enhanced stability with a lifetime of over two weeks. Experimental and theoretical analysis implies the heterostructures carry electric Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction mediated by oxygen octahedral tiltings. The results demonstrate ferroelectric&#8208;metallic heterostructures as fertile playgrounds for topological states and emergent phenomena.

         <title>Cost&#8208;Effective Symmetric PbSe&#8208;Based Device for Thermoelectric Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cost&#8208;effective symmetric PbSe&#8208;based device constructed from seven pairs of Pb0.988Cu0.002Se (p&#8208;type) and Pb1.02Cu0.002Se (n&#8208;type), which demonstrates impressive cooling temperature difference (&#916;TC) of 32.8, 36.9, and 41.0 K with the hot side maintained at 303, 323, and 343 K, respectively.








Abstract
Thermoelectric cooling technology has broad applications but is limited by the high cost of tellurium (Te) in commercially available Bi2Te3&#8208;based thermoelectric materials. Herein, a cost&#8208;effective symmetric PbSe&#8208;based device constructed from 7 pairs of Pb0.988Cu0.002Se (p&#8208;type) and Pb1.02Cu0.002Se (n&#8208;type) is presented, which demonstrates impressive cooling temperature difference (&#916;TC) of 32.8 and 41.0 K with the hot side maintained at 303 and 343 K, respectively. This low&#8208;cost symmetric PbSe&#8208;based device exhibits superior cost&#8208;effectiveness (&#916;T/cost) for near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature thermoelectric cooling compared to other Bi2Te3&#8208;based devices. Its high cooling performance primarily stems from an advanced carrier and phonon transport properties in p&#8208;type Pb0.988Cu0.002Se. Specifically, Pb vacancy and Cu substitution in Pb0.988Cu0.002Se act as strong p&#8208;type dopants that effectively optimize carrier density, resulting in a maximum power factor of 28.69 &#181;W cm&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 at room temperature. Moreover, the mobile Cu atoms within the lattice significantly impede phonon propagation, leading to a low room&#8208;temperature lattice thermal conductivity of 1.10&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1. Finally, the room&#8208;temperature figure of merit (ZT) and average ZT value in p&#8208;type Pb0.988Cu0.002Se can reach 0.6 and 0.68 at 300&#8211;573 K, surpassing previous p&#8208;type PbSe&#8208;based polycrystals. This work emphasizes the significant potential of a cost&#8208;effective PbSe compound for near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature cooling applications.

         <title>Ultrahigh Piezoelectric Coefficients Achieved by Tailoring the Sequence and Nano&#8208;Domain Structure of P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)</title>

Here, the study reports morphotropic phase boundary like behavior in a relaxor ferroelectric polymer with a unique head&#8208;to&#8208;head/tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail chain structure by the complete hydrogenation of poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;chlorotrifluoroethylene), achieving an outstanding piezoelectric coefficient of &#8722;107 pC/N, over five times higher than commercial polyvinylidene difluoride. This breakthrough enables next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance flexible devices.








Abstract
During past decades, the construction of morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) behavior in ceramic&#8208;based relaxor ferroelectrics has successfully led to a significant enhancement in the piezoelectric coefficient for actuators, transducers, and sensors application. However, MPB&#8208;like behavior is achieved only in the ferroelectric state in flexible ferroelectric polymers such as poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene) with the highest piezoelectric coefficients of &#8776;&#8722;63.5 pC/N, due to the lack of a rational design in polymer chain structure and composition. Here, the study reports the first MPB&#8208;like behavior observed in a relaxor ferroelectric polymer synthesized by fully hydrogenating poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;chlorotrifluoroethylene), which are primarily linked in a head&#8208;to&#8208;head/tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail manner, and trifluoroethylene units are randomly dispersed along the molecular chain. The unique polymer chain structure is found to be responsible for the formation of conformations disorder, thus strong relaxor behavior, and phase transition from an all&#8208;trans conformation to 3/1 helix, thus inducing phase boundary behavior. As a result, an outstanding longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient of &#8722;107 pC/N, more than five times higher than that of commercial poly(vinylidene fluoride) (&#8722;20 pC/N), is observed. This work opens up a new gate for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance flexible devices.

&lt;p&gt;Here, the study reports morphotropic phase boundary like behavior in a relaxor ferroelectric polymer with a unique head-to-head/tail-to-tail chain structure by the complete hydrogenation of poly(vinylidene fluoride-chlorotrifluoroethylene), achieving an outstanding piezoelectric coefficient of &#8722;107 pC/N, over five times higher than commercial polyvinylidene difluoride. This breakthrough enables next-generation high-performance flexible devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During past decades, the construction of morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) behavior in ceramic-based relaxor ferroelectrics has successfully led to a significant enhancement in the piezoelectric coefficient for actuators, transducers, and sensors application. However, MPB-like behavior is achieved only in the ferroelectric state in flexible ferroelectric polymers such as poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) with the highest piezoelectric coefficients of &#8776;&#8722;63.5 pC/N, due to the lack of a rational design in polymer chain structure and composition. Here, the study reports the first MPB-like behavior observed in a relaxor ferroelectric polymer synthesized by fully hydrogenating poly(vinylidene fluoride-chlorotrifluoroethylene), which are primarily linked in a head-to-head/tail-to-tail manner, and trifluoroethylene units are randomly dispersed along the molecular chain. The unique polymer chain structure is found to be responsible for the formation of conformations disorder, thus strong relaxor behavior, and phase transition from an all&lt;i&gt;-trans&lt;/i&gt; conformation to 3/1 helix, thus inducing phase boundary behavior. As a result, an outstanding longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient of &#8722;107 pC/N, more than five times higher than that of commercial poly(vinylidene fluoride) (&#8722;20 pC/N), is observed. This work opens up a new gate for next-generation high-performance flexible devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Full&#8208;Color Pixel with Only a Single Perovskite Photodiode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A full&#8208;color pixel with only a single perovskite photodiode is presented. By integrating multiple photoresponse mechanisms into one device, spectral information is encoded directly into its impedance characteristics. Machine learning&#8208;based reconstruction enables accurate color retrieval without the need for additional optical components or modulation. The RGB reconstruction error is kept below 2%.








Abstract
Photodetectors typically provide only 1D information about light intensity. Even the most basic color sensing requires external optical components, such as integrated filters. This limitation of information richness has only been overcome in recent years at the cost of spatial inefficiencies in multidetector integration designs or challenges in precisely controlling in situ modulation in single&#8208;detector designs. Acquiring high&#8208;dimensional color information with a single photodetector without external components, integration, or modulation remains a significant challenge that is aimed to resolve in this work. Due to the differences in carrier excitation by photons of varying energies, the simultaneous introduction of both electronic and ionic photoconductivity mechanisms enables the spectral characteristics of the unknown exciting light to be embedded within the impedance features of the device. By extracting impedance spectra and using machine learning&#8208;based reconstruction, a full&#8208;color pixel is achieved for the first time with just a single photodetector.

         <title>Tunable Bipolar Photothermoelectric Response from Mott Activation for In&#8208;Sensor Image Preprocessing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a gate&#8208;tunable bipolar photothermoelectric detector using a vanadium dioxide film transistor. The device offers broadband photoresponse, linear light&#8208;intensity dependence, adjustable responsivities, low energy use (8 pJ&#160;per spike), and high stability (over 5000 cycles). An integrated convolutional network excels in broadband image classification, medical image denoising, and retinal vessel segmentation, highlighting its potential for future smart edge sensors.








Abstract
In&#8208;sensor image preprocessing, a subset of edge computing, offers a solution to mitigate frequent analog&#8208;digital conversions and the von Neumann bottleneck in conventional digital hardware. However, an efficient in&#8208;sensor device array with large&#8208;scale integration capability for high&#8208;density and low&#8208;power sensory processing is still lacking and highly desirable. This work introduces an adjustable broadband photothermoelectric detector based on a phase&#8208;change vanadium dioxide thin&#8208;film transistor. This transistor employs a vanadium dioxide/gallium nitride three&#8208;terminal structure with a gate&#8208;tunable phase transition at the gate&#8208;source junctions. This design allows for modulable photothermoelectric responsivities and alteration of the short&#8208;circuit photocurrent's polarities. The devices exhibit linear gate dependence for the broadband photoresponse and linear light&#8208;intensity dependence for both positive and negative photoresponsivities. The device's energy consumption is as low as 8 pJ per spike, which is one order of magnitude lower than that of previous Mott materials&#8208;based in&#8208;sensor preprocessing devices. A wafer&#8208;scale bipolar phototransistor array has also been fabricated by standard micro&#8208;/nano&#8208;fabrication techniques, exhibiting excellent stability and endurance (over 5000 cycles). More importantly, an integrated in&#8208;sensor convolutional network is successfully designed for simultaneous broadband image classification, medical image denoising, and retinal vessel segmentation, delivering exceptional performance and paving the way for future smart edge sensors.

The combination of metal single atoms and heterojunctions creates a ladder&#8208;like built&#8208;in electric field, providing a novel and innovative photocatalyst structure for improving photocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Semiconductor heterojunctions can significantly enhance the separation of photogenerated charge carriers, among which Z&#8208;type heterojunctions are more conducive to photocatalysis due to their special transfer paths and strong oxidizing and reducing properties. However, introducing efficient active sites has always been a significant challenge in the improvement of heterogeneous photocatalysts. Herein, through in&#8208;depth analysis of the reaction mechanism and structural characteristics, single atom catalysts and heterojunctions are ingeniously integrated using built&#8208;in electric fields. For the first time, the suitable metal single atom active sites are successfully designed under the special electronic structure at the N&#8208;terminal, utilizing low electronegativity non&#8208;metallic element doping to counteract local electron migration from heterojunctions. Ladder&#8208;like built&#8208;in electric field composed of the divergent and parallel built&#8208;in electric fields from single atom catalysts and heterojunctions respectively, which introduces a new carrier separation path. AgPCN/BCN heterojunction reaches a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) yield 559.5&#160;&#181;M&#8729;h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum efficiency of 17.8% through 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction. Photoelectrochemical tests indicate the importance of 4e&#8722; water oxidation reaction as an auxiliary reaction. This novel and innovative photocatalyst structure brings new approaches for photocatalysts improvement, and new insights into the role of built&#8208;in electric fields in photocatalytic reaction mechanisms.

Electron Release via Internal Polarization Fields
The internal polarization field at the W&#8211;graphene heterointerface induces sulfur vacancy formation under ion bombardment, modulating the electronic structure via excess electron transfer. This enhances valence state filling of W and S atoms. This study highlights the relationship between the WS2 basal plane's electronic structure and electrocatalytic activity, focusing on optimizing S&#8211;H bonding. More details can be found in article number 2411211 by Hyeong&#8208;U Kim, Pil J. Yoo, Taesung Kim, and co&#8208;workers.

All&#8208;Iron Redox Flow Batteries
Aqueous redox flow batteries are limited by the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at their negative electrodes. In article number 2414596 by Emre B. Boz, Ameya Bondre, Ronald de Bruijne, and Antoni Forner&#8208;Cuenca, conductive polymers are conformally coated on porous carbonaceous electrodes to improve the reaction selectivity of hybrid all&#8208;iron redox flow batteries. Poly(pyrrole)/PSS coating inhibits HER in acidic media and increases the battery lifetime, while PEDOT/PSS electrode improves the roundtrip efficiency.

Spontaneous Twist of Ferroelectric Smectic Blocks
The ferroelectric nematic (NF) phase in achiral rod&#8208;shape mesogens is known to exhibit chiral ground state (CGS) due to the polarization escape. In this study, Hiroya Nishikawa, Fumito Araoka, and co&#8208;workers found such CGS as twisting of bulky smectic blocks in a ferroelectric smectic phase transited directly from the NF phase. More details can be found in article number 2501946.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spontaneous Twist of Ferroelectric Smectic Blocks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ferroelectric nematic (NF) phase in achiral rod-shape mesogens is known to exhibit chiral ground state (CGS) due to the polarization escape. In this study, Hiroya Nishikawa, Fumito Araoka, and co-workers found such CGS as twisting of bulky smectic blocks in a ferroelectric smectic phase transited directly from the NF phase. More details can be found in article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202501946"&gt;2501946&lt;/a&gt;.

Flame Treatment
A rapid and scalable high&#8208;temperature flame technique is developed to enable surface reconstruction of sulfide semiconductor photoelectrode for enhanced photoelectrochemical(PEC) performances. In article number 2403164, Sung Sik Shin, Xiaolin Zheng, Sun Cho, and their team demonstrate rapid surface reconstruction of Indium sulfide (In2S3) photoanode using the flame process. The flame process transforms the In2S3 surface into a 5 nm&#8208;thin In2O3 layer and generates bulk sulfur vacancies simultaneously, leading to a remarkable PEC water oxidation photocurrent density of 8.5 mA cm&#8722;2 and iodide oxidation photocurrent density of 7.3 mA cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Polyphenol&#8208;Derived Carbonaceous Frameworks with Multiscale Porosity for High&#8208;Power Electrochemical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines the fluid dynamic behavior within carbonaceous porous structures, linking structural characteristics to electrolyte transport and electrochemical performance. Specifically, it quantitatively assesses the effect of polyphenol derivatives&#8208;harnessed multiscale pore structures on active surface utilization and electrochemical activity for advancements in high&#8208;power electrochemical applications.








Abstract
With the escalating global demand for electric vehicles and sustainable energy solutions, increasing focus is placed on developing electrochemical systems that offer fast charging and high&#8208;power output, primarily governed by mass transport. Accordingly, porous carbons have emerged as highly promising electrochemically active or supporting materials due to expansive surface areas, tunable pore structures, and superior electrical conductivity, accelerating surface reaction. Yet, while substantial research has been devoted to crafting various porous carbons to increase specific surface areas, the optimal utilization of the surfaces remains underexplored. This review emphasizes the critical role of the fluid dynamics within multiscale porous carbonaceous electrodes, leading to substantially enhanced pore utilization in electrochemical systems. It elaborates on strategies of using sacrificial templates for incorporating meso/macropores into microporous carbon matrix, while exploiting the unique properties of polyphenol moieties such as sustainable carbons derived from biomass, inherent adhesive/cohesive interactions with template materials, and facile complexation capabilities with diverse materials, thereby enabling adaptive structural modulations. Furthermore, it explores how multiscale pore configurations influence pore&#8208;utilization efficiency, demonstrating advantages of incorporating multiscale pores. Finally, synergistic impact on the high&#8208;power electrochemical systems is examined, attributed to improved fluid&#8208;dynamic behavior within the carbonaceous frameworks, providing insights for advancing next&#8208;generation high&#8208;power electrochemical applications.

         <title>Natural and Nature&#8208;Inspired Biomaterial Additives for Metal Halide Perovskite Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review surveys natural biomaterials and nature&#8208;inspired artificial materials as additives for metal halide perovskite films in optoelectronics, including solar cells, light&#8208;emitting diodes, photodetectors, and X&#8208;ray detectors. It discusses how these biomaterials differ from conventional materials in terms of their impact on device performance from both mechanistic and functional viewpoints. Although solar cell applications dominate, reports on other applications are rapidly increasing.








Abstract
This comprehensive review meticulously categorizes and discusses the applications of diverse biomaterials, specifically natural and nature&#8208;inspired synthetic materials in metal halide perovskite optoelectronics. Applications range from solar cells to light&#8208;emitting diodes, photodetectors, and X&#8208;ray detectors. Emphasis is placed on the intricate interactions between bio&#8208;additives and perovskite crystals, highlighting their influence on the grain size, crystal orientation, grain boundaries, and surface passivation. This review also explores the advantages and disadvantages of each natural or nature&#8208;inspired material and their unique properties compared with conventional additives. Special attention is given to the mechanistic and functional viewpoints, showing how these biomaterials enhance device performance. Through additive engineering with ecofriendly biomaterials, defects in metal halide perovskite thin films can be effectively passivated, thus extending the photostability or in some cases mechanical flexibility of devices. This review provides valuable insights for selecting and designing next&#8208;generation biomaterial additives, offering new prospects for achieving high&#8208;performance perovskite layers and advancing the field of peorvskite&#8208; based optoelectronics.

         <title>Aerosol CVD Carbon Nanotube Thin Films: From Synthesis to Advanced Applications: A Comprehensive Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aerosol chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a cutting&#8208;edge method for producing carbon nanotube (CNT) thin films through gas&#8208;phase synthesis and filtration collection. The films exhibit exceptional electrical, optical, and mechanical properties. This review provides comprehensive guidelines from synthesis to applications, emphasizing how precise control of aerosol CVD parameters enables scalability and enhances commercial viability across diverse technological applications.








Abstract
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) produced by the floating&#8208;catalyst chemical vapor deposition (FCCVD) method are among the most promising nanomaterials of today, attracting interest from both academic and industrial sectors. These CNTs exhibit exceptional electrical conductivity, optical properties, and mechanical resilience due to their binder&#8208;free and low&#8208;defect structure, while the FCCVD method enables their continuous and scalable synthesis. Among the methodological FCCVD variations, aerosol CVD&#8217; is distinguished by its production of freestanding thin films comprising macroscale CNT networks, which exhibit superior performance and practical applicability. This review elucidates the complex interrelations between aerosol CVD reactor synthesis conditions and the resulting properties of the CNTs. A unified approach connecting all stages of the synthesis process is proposed as a comprehensive guide. This review examines the correlations between CNT structural parameters (length and diameter) and resultant film properties (conductivity, optical, and mechanical characteristics) to establish a comprehensive framework for optimizing CNT thin film synthesis. The analysis encompasses characterization methodologies specific to aerosol CVD&#8208;synthesized CNTs and evaluates how their properties influence applications across diverse domains, from energy devices to optoelectronics. The review concludes by addressing current challenges and prospects in this field.

         <title>Material Selection and Device Design of Scalable Flexible Brain&#8208;Computer Interfaces: A Balance Between Electrical and Mechanical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>

This review explores the balance between electrical and mechanical performance of flexible BCIs through the careful selection of electronic materials and probe design to achieve long&#8208;term stable neural recordings with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios.








Abstract
Brain&#8208;computer interfaces (BCIs) hold the potential to revolutionize brain function restoration, enhance human capability, and advance our understanding of cognitive mechanisms by directly linking neural signals with hardware. However, the mechanical mismatch between conventional rigid BCIs and soft brain tissue limits long&#8208;term interface stability. Next&#8208;generation BCIs must achieve long&#8208;term biocompatibility while maintaining high performance, enabling the integration of millions of sensors within tissue&#8208;level flexible and soft, stable neural interfaces. Lithographic fabrication techniques provide scalable thin&#8208;film flexible electronics, but traditional electronic materials often fail to meet the unique requirements of BCIs. This review examines the selection of materials and device design for flexible BCIs, starting with an analysis of intrinsic material properties&#8212;Young's modulus, electrical conductivity and dielectric constant. It then explores the integration of material selection with electrode design to optimize electrical circuits and assess key mechanical factors. Next, the correlation between electrical and mechanical performance is analyzed to guide material selection and device design. Finally, recent advances in neural probes are reviewed, highlighting improvements in signal quality, recording stability, and scalability. This review focuses on scalable, lithography&#8208;based BCIs, aiming to identify optimal materials and designs for long&#8208;term, reliable neural recordings.

         <title>One&#8208;Shot Remote Integration of Macromolecular Synaptic Elements on a Chip for Ultrathin Flexible Neural Network System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel one&#8208;shot integration electropolymerization (OSIEP) method is developed as a breakthrough on the intricate photolithographic steps, enabling to compress all processes from synthesis to channel integration in one&#8208;shot manufacturing. The specially designed dual bipolar electrodes provide the targeted depositions of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) on 6 &#215; 5 channel array. A multi&#8208;gate synaptic circuit mimicking operant conditioning constructed by OSIEP is successfully evaluated.








Abstract
The field of biomimetic electronics that mimic&#160;synaptic&#160;functions&#160;has expanded significantly to overcome the limitations&#160;of&#160;the&#160;von Neumann bottleneck. However, the scaling down of the technology has led to an increasingly intricate manufacturing process. To address the issue, this work presents a one&#8208;shot integrable electropolymerization (OSIEP) method with remote controllability for the deposition of synaptic elements on a chip by exploiting bipolar electrochemistry. Condensing synthesis, deposition, and patterning into a single fabrication step is achieved by combining alternating&#8208;current voltage superimposed on direct&#8208;current voltage&#8208;bipolar electropolymerization and a specially designed dual source/drain bipolar electrodes. As a result, uniform 6 &#215; 5 arrays of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) channels are successfully&#160;fabricated&#160;on flexible ultrathin parylene substrates in one&#8208;shot process. The channels exhibited highly uniform characteristics and are directly used as electrochemical synaptic transistor with synaptic plasticity over 100 s. The synaptic transistors have demonstrated promising performance in an artificial neural network (NN) simulation, achieving a high recognition accuracy of 95.20%. Additionally, the array of synaptic transistor is easily reconfigured to a multi&#8208;gate synaptic circuit to implement the principles of operant conditioning. These results provide a compelling fabrication strategy for realizing cost&#8208;effective and disposable NN systems with high integration density.

         <title>Charged Black&#8208;Hole&#8208;Like Electronic Structure Driven by Geometric Potential of 2D Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is found that curvature in 2D semiconductors triggers the modified geometric potential with curvature&#8208;induced bandgap change, resembling the effective potential of black holes. The atomic&#8208;scale observation of bound states in the modified geometric potential shows an analog of the stable orbits near black holes. The modified geometric potential is related to curvature&#8208;induced variations in both band gap and spin&#8208;orbit interaction.








Abstract
One of the exotic expectations in the 2D curved spacetime is the geometric potential from the curvature of the 2D space, still possessing unsolved fundamental questions through Dirac quantization. The atomically thin 2D materials are promising for the realization of the geometric potential, but the geometric potential in 2D materials is not identified experimentally. Here, the curvature&#8208;induced ring&#8208;patterned bound states are observed in structurally deformed 2D semiconductors and formulated the modified geometric potential for the curvature effect, which demonstrates the ring&#8208;shape bound states with angular momentum. The formulated modified geometric potential is analogous to the effective potential of a rotating charged black hole. Density functional theory and tight&#8208;binding calculations are performed, which quantitatively agree well with the results of the modified geometric potential. The modified geometric potential is described by modified Gaussian and mean curvatures, corresponding to the curvature&#8208;induced changes in spin&#8208;orbit interaction and band gap, respectively. Even for complex structural deformation, the geometric potential solves the complexity, which aligns well with experimental results.

&lt;p&gt;It is found that curvature in 2D semiconductors triggers the modified geometric potential with curvature-induced bandgap change, resembling the effective potential of black holes. The atomic-scale observation of bound states in the modified geometric potential shows an analog of the stable orbits near black holes. The modified geometric potential is related to curvature-induced variations in both band gap and spin-orbit interaction.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the exotic expectations in the 2D curved spacetime is the geometric potential from the curvature of the 2D space, still possessing unsolved fundamental questions through Dirac quantization. The atomically thin 2D materials are promising for the realization of the geometric potential, but the geometric potential in 2D materials is not identified experimentally. Here, the curvature-induced ring-patterned bound states are observed in structurally deformed 2D semiconductors and formulated the modified geometric potential for the curvature effect, which demonstrates the ring-shape bound states with angular momentum. The formulated modified geometric potential is analogous to the effective potential of a rotating charged black hole. Density functional theory and tight-binding calculations are performed, which quantitatively agree well with the results of the modified geometric potential. The modified geometric potential is described by modified Gaussian and mean curvatures, corresponding to the curvature-induced changes in spin-orbit interaction and band gap, respectively. Even for complex structural deformation, the geometric potential solves the complexity, which aligns well with experimental results. The understanding of the modified geometric potential provides us with an intuitive clue for quantum transport and a key factor for new quantum applications such as valleytronics, spintronics, and straintronics in 2D semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Engineering of Thermodynamically Enhanced SaCas9 for Improved Gene Suppression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermostable Cas9 (CRISPR&#8208;associated protein 9) variant is developed using a structure&#8208;guided protein engineering approach. By thermodynamic analysis, deletable domains are identified to enhance stability while preserving function. Also, a 3D&#160;structure with novel conformation of nontarget&#8208;stranded DNA is confirmed through cryo&#8208;electron microscopy. Fusion with functional elements for CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) interference applications enables gene suppression efficiency, demonstrating the potential of tailored CRISPR systems.








Abstract
Proteins with multiple domains play pivotal roles in various biological processes, necessitating a thorough understanding of their structural stability and functional interplay. Here, a structure&#8208;guided protein engineering approach is proposed to develop thermostable Cas9 (CRISPR&#8208;associated protein 9)&#160;variant for CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)&#160;interference applications. By employing thermodynamic analysis, combining distance mapping and molecular dynamics simulations, deletable domains are identified to enhance stability while preserving the DNA recognition function of Cas9. The resulting engineered Cas9, termed small and dead form Cas9, exhibits improved thermostability and maintains target DNA recognition function. Cryo&#8208;electron microscopy analysis reveals structural integrity with reduced atomic density in the deleted domain. Fusion with functional elements enables intracellular delivery and nuclear localization, demonstrating efficient gene suppression in diverse cell types. Direct delivery in the mouse brain shows enhanced knockdown efficiency, highlighting the potential of structure&#8208;guided engineering to develop functional CRISPR systems tailored for specific applications. This study underscores the significance of integrating computational and experimental approaches for protein engineering, offering insights into designing tailored molecular tools for precise biological interventions.

         <title>Responsive Ordered Assembly of Magnetic Nanoparticles for ROS Activatable Magnetic Particle Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive ordered assembly of magnetic nanoparticles (RMNAs) achieve a ROS&#8208;dependent off/on MPI signal regulation through the ordered assembly/disassembly&#8208;mediated MPI tuning strategy. Remarkably, the activatable MPI probe, RMNA, demonstrates a 3.98&#8208;fold recovery of MPI signals in response to ROS conditions, enabling ultra&#8208;sensitive monitoring of acute liver injury at a low dosage of 0.05 mg&#160;kg&#8722;1, with a 27&#8208;fold increase in MPI signals compared to the non&#8208;responsive group.








Abstract
Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) has emerged as a versatile biomedical imaging modality, yet a significant challenge persists in the absence of activatable MPI probes for targeted imaging of disease biomarkers. In this study, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive ordered assembly of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) is reported, engineered through the meticulous design of magnetic nanoparticle building blocks and ROS&#8208;responsive polymeric ligands, enabling precise control over the assembly structure. This ordered configuration amplifies magnetic dipole&#8208;dipole interactions, raising the energy barrier during nonequilibrium dynamic magnetization and effectively quenching the MPI signal. By modulating the assembly and disassembly of these ordered structures in response to ROS, this nanoprobe achieves ROS&#8208;dependent off/on MPI signal regulation. Consequently, the probe enables the monitoring of early pathological ROS change in a mice model of early acute liver injury, facilitating highly sensitive monitoring of the ROS level&#8208;dependent severity of the disease. This work represents the inaugural application of microenvironment&#8208;responsive MPI probes for the early diagnosis of ROS&#8208;associated diseases. The introduction of ordered assembly structures for MPI signal tuning offers a promising translational approach in the development of next&#8208;generation activatable MPI probes.

         <title>Near Infrared Light&#8208;Based Non&#8208;Contact Sensing System for Robotics Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;contact intelligent sensing system that can accurately recognize patterns formed by NIR light is reported. Black phosphate (BP)&#8208;based organogel with anti&#8208;freezing and water retention properties as non&#8208;contact sensor can be used in extremely cold or hot environments. The designed non&#8208;contact sensing system shows good robustness by maintaining high sensitivity over a wide temperature range, long working distances, different current intensities, and dark conditions.








Abstract
With the development of artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things, non&#8208;contact sensors are expected to realize complex human&#8208;computer interaction. However, current non&#8208;contact sensors are mainly limited by accuracy and stability. Herein, an intelligent infrared photothermal non&#8208;contact sensing system is developed that provides long&#8208;distance and high&#8208;accuracy non&#8208;contact sensing. A black phosphorus (BP)&#8208;based composite organogel is designed, which exhibits excellent photothermal properties and environmental stability, as the active material. This material can detect patterns created by near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light through various patterned masks monitored by an infrared thermal imager. The constructed non&#8208;contact sensing system is capable of accurately recognizing 26 letters with an impressive accuracy rate of 99.4%. Furthermore, even small size non&#8208;contact sensors can maintain high sensitivity and stability across a wide temperature range, at long working distances, and under different current intensities and dark conditions, demonstrating exceptional robustness. Combined with machine learning method, it is demonstrated that the non&#8208;contact sensing system excels in pattern recognition and human&#8208;computer interaction. These features highlight its potential applications in intelligent robotics and remote control systems.

         <title>Conductive Polymer Coatings Control Reaction Selectivity in All&#8208;Iron Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous redox flow batteries are limited by the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at their negative electrodes. In this work, conductive polymers are conformally coated on porous carbonaceous electrodes to improve the reaction selectivity of hybrid all&#8208;iron redox flow batteries. Poly(pyrrole)/PSS coating inhibits HER in acidic media and increases the battery lifetime, while PEDOT/PSS electrode improves the roundtrip efficiency.








Abstract
Aqueous all&#8208;iron redox flow batteries are an attractive and economic technology for grid&#8208;scale energy storage owing to their use of abundant and environmentally benign iron as the redox active material and water as solvent. However, the battery operation is challenged by the plating/stripping reactions of iron and the competing hydrogen evolution reaction at the negative electrode, which hinder performance and durability. Here, the reaction selectivity of the negative electrode is tailored by introducing conductive polymer coatings onto porous carbonaceous electrodes. Two conductive polymers, poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and poly(pyrrole) (PPy) are conformally coated with the dopant poly(4&#8208;styrenesulfonate) (PSS) and the resulting electrochemistry is studied on model electroanalytical platforms and redox flow batteries. Both polymers decrease the hydrogen evolution current on rotating disc electrodes, with PPy/PSS strongly inhibiting the reaction at high overpotentials. In full all&#8208;iron redox flow cells, PPy/PSS coating extends cyclability and significantly reduces hydrogen evolution, while PEDOT/PSS coating improves the round&#8208;trip efficiency, possibly acting as a redox shuttle for the iron stripping reaction. These findings motivate broader investigation and implementation of conductive polymers to engineer reaction selectivity for flow batteries and other electrochemical technologies.

         <title>When Graphitic Nitrogen Meets Pentagons: Selective Construction and Spectroscopic Evidence for Improved Four&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exclusive construction of graphitic nitrogen coordinated with pentagon defects is achieved by pyrolysis of zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 under unusually high temperatures. The graphitic nitrogen model electrocatalyst enables highly efficient four&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction in both alkaline and acidic conditions, as evidenced by in situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy.








Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon materials have emerged as promising metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries. However, the structural inhomogeneity, particularly the coexistence of four nitrogen doping structures&#8211;pyridinic, graphitic, pyrrolic, and oxidized nitrogen&#8211;makes assessing their respective contributions challenging and controversial. The current understanding of the four nitrogen doping structures may be also oversimplified and even problematic. The development of a distinctive graphitic&#8208;N&#8208;doped carbon electrocatalyst is presented in which graphitic nitrogen coordinated with pentagon defects is selectively constructed. Contrary to the previously held belief that graphitic nitrogen has little effect on ORR electrocatalysis, the unique graphitic N configuration exhibited significantly enhanced four&#8208;electron ORR activity in both alkaline and acidic media. In situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations further revealed that graphitic nitrogen, when coordinated with pentagon defects, optimized the density of states near the Fermi level, leading to optimized binding energies with oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates. The results rationalize the long&#8208;standing controversy over the role of different nitrogen dopants in ORR electrocatalysis and suggest that there is considerable potential to precisely construct new nitrogen doping configurations to achieve superior electrocatalytic performance.

         <title>Boosted Hydrogen Evolution via Photoinduced Hole Transfer in Molecular&#8208;Level Organic Heterojunction under NIR Photon Excitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brand&#8208;new A&#8208;D1&#8208;D2&#8208;D1&#8208;A type electron acceptor BTPT&#8208;IC4F is designed, synthesized and integrated with donor polymer PBDB&#8208;T to achieve full&#8208;spectrum light harvesting. PBDB&#8208;T:BTPT&#8208;IC4F nanoparticles exhibit a promising external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 6.3% at 730&#160;nm, which is attributed to efficient hole extraction from BTPT&#8208;IC4F* (excited BTPT&#8208;IC4F) to PBDB&#8208;T phase in the molecular&#8208;level heterojunction under pure near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photon excitation.









Abstract
The energy of sunlight is predominantly concentrated in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region, posing a paramount limitation for practical application of conventional photocatalysts. Organic semiconductors can offer NIR absorption and tunable energy levels simultaneously through molecular engineering, which presents great potential in solar&#8208;driven catalysis. However, an individual organic semiconductor typically generates Frenkel excitons with large binding energy, hindering efficient electron&#8208;hole separation. Herein, we develop molecular&#8208;level heterojunction to suppress electron&#8208;hole recombination, thereby achieving a boosted hydrogen (H2) evolution reaction rate of 25.54&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 (12.77&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1) under visible&#8211;near&#8208;infrared (Vis&#8211;NIR) light. Surprisingly, heterojunction nanoparticles (NPs) comprising donor polymer PBDB&#8208;T matched with an A&#8208;D1&#8208;D2&#8208;D1&#8208;A type acceptor BTPT&#8208;IC4F exhibit a promising external quantum efficiency of 6.3% at 730&#160;nm. Transient absorption spectroscopy monitors effective extraction of photogenerated holes from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of BTPT&#8208;IC4F to the HOMO of PBDB&#8208;T, while first&#8208;principle calculations confirm the prolonged lifetime of excited BTPT&#8208;IC4F due to efficient hole capture by the PBDB&#8208;T phase. The outstanding performance of heterojunction NPs under NIR light is ascribed to strong hole transfer within the nanoparticle. This study provides valuable insights for designing molecular&#8208;level organic heterojunction photocatalysts toward NIR light&#8208;driven H2 evolution and other potential reactions.

         <title>PSMA&#8208;Targeted Nanoparticles with PI3K/mTOR Dual Inhibitor Downregulate P&#8208;Glycoprotein and Inactivate Myeloid&#8208;Derived Suppressor Cells for Enhanced Chemotherapy and Immunotherapy in Prostate Cancer</title>

This study presents glutathione&#8208;responsive nanoparticles (PSMA&#8208;NP/BEZ) targeting prostate&#8208;specific membrane antigen to deliver a PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor. The system simultaneously suppresses P&#8208;glycoprotein&#8208;mediated drug resistance, enhances chemotherapy sensitivity, and reprograms immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments by inactivating myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells, offering a dual chemo&#8208;immunotherapeutic strategy against advanced prostate cancer.








Abstract
Acquired drug resistance and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment significantly limit the efficacy of chemotherapy and immunotherapy in advanced prostate cancer. Blocking the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway has been recently proved as a new strategy to improve sensitivity to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Herein, glutathione (GSH)&#8208;sensitive nanoparticles (PSMA&#8208;NP/BEZ) are developed that can target prostate&#8208;specific membrane antigen (PSMA), loaded with PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor prodrug BEZ235. BEZ235 can be released from PSMA&#8208;NP/BEZ in response to elevated GSH levels in prostate cancer tissues, inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and impairing downstream cellular functions such as cell proliferation, DNA repair, and protein synthesis. When combined with paclitaxel, PSMA&#8208;NP/BEZ could reduce drug efflux by downregulating P&#8208;glycoprotein expression in cancer cells, thus enhancing the sensitivity to chemotherapy. Furthermore, PSMA&#8208;NP/BEZ could impair the immunosuppressive functions of myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells and reshape the &#8220;cold&#8221; immune microenvironment in prostate cancer, enhancing immunotherapeutic efficacy and including long&#8208;term immune memory against tumor recurrence. PSMA&#8208;NP/BEZ serves a safe and promising strategy to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy and immunotherapy in advanced prostate cancer.

         <title>Supramolecular Conductive Hydrogels With Homogeneous Ionic and Electronic Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) based conductive hydrogels have received great attention in bioelectronics on account of their tissue&#8208;like mechanical properties. However, inhomogeneous morphologies of the conducting PEDOT phase limits their electrical and mechanical properties. Here, supramolecular hydrogels with self&#8208;doped PEDOT (S&#8208;PEDOT) homogeneously distributed are reported, which simultaneously exhibit high toughness (620 kJ m&#8722;3), softness (10.5 kPa) and conductivity (5.8 S cm&#8722;1).








Abstract
Mechanically resilient hydrogels with ion&#8208;electron mixed transport properties effectively bridge biology with electronics. An ideal bioelectronic interface can be realized through introducing electronically conductive polymers into supramolecular hydrogels. However, inhomogeneous morphologies of conducting polymers, such as poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), have limited mechanical properties and ion&#8208;electron interactions. Here, supramolecular conductive hydrogels that possess homogeneous ionic and electronic transport are achieved. The materials demonstrate high toughness (620&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;3), stretchability (&gt;1000%), softness (10.5&#160;kPa), and conductivity (5.8&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1), which surpasses commonly used inhomogeneous PEDOT:PSS&#8208;based hydrogels. The homogeneous network leads to higher charge injection capacitance and lower skin impedance compared to commercial electrodes or commonly used inhomogeneous PEDOT:PSS conducting networks. This significant advance arises from the homogeneous incorporation of the hydrophilic self&#8208;doped conducting polymer S&#8208;PEDOT, which has polymerized within a supramolecular polymer network template mediated by high&#8208;binding affinity host&#8208;guest crosslinks. Furthermore, the compatibility of S&#8208;PEDOT with hydrophilic secondary networks enables the realization of fully dryable and reswellable electronic devices, facilitating reusability and improving their ease of handling. It is anticipated that achieving such material architectures will offer a promising new direction in future synthesis and implementation of conductive hydrogels in the field of&#160;bioelectronics.

         <title>Single&#8208;Layer Spin&#8208;Orbit&#8208;Torque Magnetization Switching Due to Spin Berry Curvature Generated by Minute Spontaneous Atomic Displacement in a Weyl Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;layer magnetization switching with a small critical current density of &#8776;106&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 is demonstrated. The strong intrinsic spin Hall effect, causing the switching, is induced by the synergy of the inherent spin&#8208;orbit coupling and the spontaneous oxygen octahedral rotation in SrRuO3.The findings highlight the immense potential for realizing efficient material systems for spin&#8208;orbitronics applications by precise atom positioning.








Abstract
Spin Berry curvature characterizes the band topology as the spin counterpart of Berry curvature and is crucial in generating novel spintronics functionalities. By breaking the crystalline inversion symmetry, the spin Berry curvature is expected to be significantly enhanced; this enhancement will increase the intrinsic spin Hall effect in ferromagnetic materials and, thus, the spin&#8211;orbit torques (SOTs). However, this intriguing approach is not applied to devices; generally, the spin Hall effect in ferromagnet/heavy&#8208;metal bilayer is used for SOT magnetization switching. Here, SOT&#8208;induced partial magnetization switching is demonstrated in a single layer of a single&#8208;crystalline Weyl oxide SrRuO3 (SRO) with a small current density of &#8776;3.1&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2. Detailed analysis of the crystal structure in the seemingly perfect periodic lattice of the SRO film reveals barely discernible oxygen octahedral rotations with angles of &#8776;5&#176; near the interface with a substrate. Tight&#8208;binding calculations indicate that a large spin Hall conductivity is induced around small gaps generated at band crossings by the synergy of inherent spin&#8210;orbit coupling and band inversion due to the rotations, causing magnetization reversal. The results indicate that a minute atomic displacement in single&#8208;crystal films can induce strong intrinsic SOTs that are useful for spin&#8208;orbitronics devices.

         <title>Cardiac Organoid Model Inspired Micro&#8208;Robot Smart Patch to Treat Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The heart organoid model exhibits the acidic microenvironment characteristic of myocardial infarction, which emerges as a pivotal force propelling the movement of micro&#8208;robots. These micro&#8208;robots, administered through microneedles, can penetrate deep into the tissue, effectively delivering therapeutic payloads to facilitate heart repair.








Abstract
Post&#8208;myocardial infarction (MI), the rapid decrease in pH triggers myocardial cell acidosis, which compromises the therapeutic efficacy of exosomes in MI. The groundbreaking research in the human cardiac organoid MI model suggests that exosomes, when paired with pH adjustment, dramatically reduce cardiomyocyte mortality while maintaining their proliferative potential, underscoring the importance of pH regulation in myocardial preservation. Micro&#8208;robot mounted micro&#8208;needle (MN) patch is thus proposed, targeting MI&#8208;acidic microenvironmet, to deliver exosomes into deep injured tissue. Upon injection, the patch base releases VEGF&#8208;laden nanoparticles adhering to the infarcted myocardium. The smart patch is found not only 3D reconstructs the vascular network in MI regions but also effectively saves cardiomyocytes in rats. Furthermore, the minimally invasive delivery of MN patches are also verified to hearts of rabbits and pigs via thoracoscopic surgery underscores. These findings suggest that precise regulation of the microenvironment is a key to improving treatment outcomes.

         <title>Designing Supported Nanoparticles via Synergistic Ex&#8208;Solution and Phosphorization for Tailored Active Site Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot process synchronizing nanoparticle ex&#8208;solution and phosphorization is developed for simultaneous phosphide nanoparticle synthesis and host oxide functionalization. The resulting IrRuP/WO2.9 catalyst achieves exceptional mass activity and low onset potential for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction, significantly outperforming commercial Pt/C and offering a promising alternative for high&#8208;performance electrocatalysis.









Abstract
Supported nanoparticles incorporating catalytically attractive nonmetal elements have gained significant attention as a promising strategy for enhancing catalytic activity in various industrial applications. This study presents an innovative one&#8208;pot synthesis method for fabricating hybrid catalysts, which simultaneously modifies surface properties through the precipitation of nanoparticles with the concurrent incorporation of nonmetal elements. The underlying concept is to synchronize the temperature required for particle formation with that of nonmetal incorporation by adjusting the oxygen chemical potential of the host oxide. As a case study, Ir&#8208; and Ru&#8208;doped WO3 are selected as the starting material, with phosphorus (P) as the representative nonmetal for surface functionalization. Notably, the hybrid catalyst, composed of amorphous (Ir,Ru)Px particles dispersed on P&#8208;rich WO2.9 sheets, is synthesized through a single heat treatment at 500&#160;&#176;C, avoiding undesirable sintering of the host material. When used as a hydrogen evolution catalyst, this material exhibits outstanding mass activity, durability, compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C catalysts. Density functional theory calculations further reveal that the superior performance of the hybrid catalysts attributes to improved water dissociation and favorable adsorption and desorption of key reaction intermediates. This novel synthesis strategy offers considerable potential for advancing diverse areas of heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Molecular Domino Toppling for Directed Self&#8208;Erasing Information Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An azobenzene&#8208;based material with unprecedented light&#8208;pumped directional charge&#8208;transfer reminiscent of toppling dominoes is presented. After light&#8208;induced trans&#8594;cis forward isomerization, electron hopping occurs in a sequential and propagating manner between the cis isomers along with an electrocatalytic cis&#8594;trans backward isomerization. This repeatable, self&#8208;erasing domino information transfer is a groundbreaking new mechanism, suitable to process information on the molecular level.








Abstract
In the pursuit of more secure information transfer, advanced nanoelectronic technologies and nanomaterials must be developed. Here, a material is presented able to undergo an unprecedented light&#8208;pumped directional charge&#8208;transfer process reminiscent of toppling dominoes. The material is based on ortho&#8208;fluorinated azobenzene molecules which are organized in molecular rows by the regular array of a metal&#8211;organic framework. The azobenzene molecules undergo light&#8208;induced trans&#8594;cis forward as well as electrocatalytic cis&#8594;trans backward isomerization. The findings reveal that electron hopping occurs in a sequential and propagating manner between the light&#8208;generated cis isomers along with an isomerization of the sample to the trans&#8208;state. Thus, light can be used to locally write information, which subsequently can be read out by the transferred charge with simultaneous deletion of the information. This freely repeatable, self&#8208;erasing domino information transfer is a groundbreaking new mechanism to process information on the molecular level that may find application in encryption.

         <title>Magnetically Switchable Adhesive Millirobots for Universal Manipulation in both Air and Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a series of millirobots with magnetically switchable adhesion, enabled by soft, double&#8208;reentrant micropillar arrays with side liquid&#8208;repellency. These millirobots can universally manipulate a wide range of targets in both air and water. Beyond transportation, they are capable of performing various complex tasks, such as circuit repair, precision assembly, and high&#8208;speed actuation in amphibious environments.








Abstract
Magnetic soft robots with multimodal locomotion have demonstrated significant potential for target manipulation tasks in hard&#8208;to&#8208;reach spaces in recent years. Achieving universal manipulation between robots and their targets requires a nondestructive and easily switchable interaction with broad applicability across diverse targets.

&lt;p&gt;This study presents a series of millirobots with magnetically switchable adhesion, enabled by soft, double-reentrant micropillar arrays with side liquid-repellency. These millirobots can universally manipulate a wide range of targets in both air and water. Beyond transportation, they are capable of performing various complex tasks, such as circuit repair, precision assembly, and high-speed actuation in amphibious environments.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetic soft robots with multimodal locomotion have demonstrated significant potential for target manipulation tasks in hard-to-reach spaces in recent years. Achieving universal manipulation between robots and their targets requires a nondestructive and easily switchable interaction with broad applicability across diverse targets. However, establishing versatile and dynamic interactions between diverse targets and robotic systems remains a significant challenge. Herein, a series of magnetic millirobots capable of universal target manipulation with magnetically switchable adhesion is reported. Through two-photon lithography-assisted molding, magnetic soft double-reentrant micropillar arrays with liquid repellency are fabricated on the robots. These micropillar arrays can serve as switchable adhesion units for the millirobots to effectively manipulate targets of various geometries (0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D) in both air and water. As proof-of-concept demonstrations, these adhesive robots can perform various complex tasks, including circuit repair, mini-turbine assembly, and high-speed underwater rotation of the turbine machine. This work may offer a versatile approach to magnetic manipulation of non-magnetic objects through amphibious adhesion, emerging as a new paradigm in robotic manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electric&#8208;Field Regulation of Adhesion/De&#8208;Adhesion/Release Capacity of Transparent and Electrochromic Adhesive</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conductive hydrogel with surface adhesion and electric field&#8208;triggered de&#8208;adhesion and release is fabricated from thioctic acid and L&#8208;arginine. The non&#8208;covalent intermolecular attractions not only endow the hydrogel with useful bulk&#8208;state properties and strong adhesion but also generate electric responsiveness for on&#8208;demand de&#8208;adhesion and release.








Abstract
Removing adhesive nondestructively and intact from the adhered surface is a difficult challenge for advanced adhesive materials. Compared with the commonly used thermal or chemical release, the controlled adhesive release via electric&#8208;field offers practical application advantages. However, a noninvasive release mode such as this has not been available for the de&#8208;bonding of supramolecular adhesives that originate from small organic molecules. Herein, a conductive hydrogel with surface adhesion and electric field&#8208;triggered de&#8208;adhesion and release is fabricated from thioctic acid (TA) and L&#8208;arginine (LA). The non&#8208;covalent intermolecular attractions of poly[TA&#8208;LA], especially its electrostatic interactions, not only endow it with useful bulk&#8208;state properties and strong adhesion (up to 363.3&#160;kPa) but also generate electric responsiveness for on&#8208;demand de&#8208;adhesion and release. The poly[TA&#8208;LA] adhesive layer can be easily released within a short time (&lt;60 s) under a mild voltage (5&#8776;10&#160;V). After a combined experimental and theoretical investigation, It is concluded that the adhesive&#8208;layer morphological and mechanical changes, activated by a weak current (1.1&#8776;3.2&#160;mA), are responsible for the adhesion failure, which takes place primarily at the anode. Importantly, rapid electric release of poly[TA&#8208;LA] is applicable at low temperatures (5 V, 60 s, &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C) or underwater (5 V, 60 s, 25&#160;&#176;C).

         <title>In Situ Impurity Phase Repair Strategy Enables Highly&#8208;Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells with Periodic Photovoltaic Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite, ideal for high&#8208;efficiency solar cells, suffers from impurity phases causing defects and instability. Using FAI/MASCN vapors repairs impurities into &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, enhancing charge transport and morphology. This achieves 26.05% efficiency, with large&#8208;area devices (24.52% for 1 cm2, 22.35% for 17.1 cm2). Cyclic repair retains 94.3% efficiency after two cycles, significantly boosting device durability.








Abstract
The photoactive &#945;&#8208;phase of formamidinium lead iodide perovskite (&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) is regarded as one of the ideal materials for high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to its superior optoelectronic properties. However, during the deposition of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite films, the presence of impurity phases, such as PbI2 and &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3, can cause the formation of inherent defects, which leads to suboptimal charge transport and extraction properties, as well as inadequate long&#8208;term stability in the film's morphology and structure. To address these issues, an impurity phase repair strategy is employed using FAI/MASCN mixed vapors to convert the impurity phases into light&#8208;absorbing &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. Meanwhile, this recrystallization process also facilitates the recovery of its characteristic morphology, thereby improving efficiency and enhancing the durability of PSCs. This approach promotes the PSCs to obtain an efficiency of 26.05% (with a certified efficiency of 25.67%, and steady&#8208;state PCE of 25.41%). Additionally, this approach is suitable for the fabrication of large&#8208;area devices, obtaining a 1 cm2 device with a PCE of 24.52% and a mini&#8208;module (with an area of 17.1 cm2) with a PCE of 22.35%. Furthermore, it is found that this strategy enables cyclic repair of aged perovskite films, with the perovskite solar cells retaining &#8776; 94.3% of their initial efficiency after two cycles of repair, significantly enhancing the lifetime of the perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Engineered Polar Topological Domains in Ferroelectric Nematic Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative interfacial engineering strategy has been proposed to construct and modulate polar topological domains within ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals. These ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals, featuring diverse and adjustable polar topological structures including vortex, centrifugal vortex, and center&#8208;divergent domains, hold significant potential for applications in the field of topological photonics.








Abstract
Polar topological domains, distinguished by their inherent topological protection and diverse optoelectronic functionalities, have recently attracted significant interest across scientific disciplines. However, the realization of these structures in inorganic materials is often impeded by crystal symmetry constraints. In this context, ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals, characterized by spontaneous polarization and flexible polarization orientation, provide an exceptional platform for the development of polar topological domains. Despite their potential, a considerable challenge lies in identifying a straightforward yet versatile approach for engineering polar topological domains within liquid crystals. Here, this study presents an interfacial engineering strategy that effectively stabilizes a range of polar topological domains in ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals, including vortex, centrifugal vortex, and center&#8208;divergent configurations, by synergistically modulating the surface tension and interfacial tension. Utilizing a combination of experimental characterization and simulation, the role of anchoring energy is systematically investigated in the molecular alignment of liquid crystals and facilitates transitions between diverse topological structures. This research not only extends the horizons for constructing and manipulating polar topological domains but also enhances their prospective applications in topological photonics.

         <title>Intravasation&#8208;On&#8208;&#181;Device (INVADE): Engineering Dynamic Vascular Interfaces to Study Cancer Cell Intravasation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cancer metastasis begins with intravasation, a complex process involving cancer&#8208;endothelial interactions. INVADE (Intravasation&#8208;on&#8208;&#181;Device), a biomimetic microfluidic platform enables high&#8208;throughput analysis of intravasation under controlled conditions. This system reveals distinct invasion modes, an epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition (EMT) &#8208; mesenchymal&#8208;epithelial transition (MET) switch, and endothelial suppression of mesenchymal traits. It also uncovers bilateral signaling, highlighting dynamic cancer&#8208;endothelial crosstalk with implications for metastasis research.

Abstract
Cancer metastasis begins with intravasation, where cancer cells enter blood vessels through complex interactions with the endothelial barrier. Understanding this process remains challenging due to the lack of physiologically relevant models. Here, INVADE (Intravasation&#8208;on&#8208;&#181;Device), a biomimetic microfluidic platform, is presented, enabling high&#8208;throughput analysis of cancer cell intravasation under controlled conditions. This engineered platform integrates 23 parallel niche chambers with an endothelialized channel, providing both precise microenvironmental control and optical accessibility for real&#8208;time visualization. Using this platform, distinct intravasation mechanisms are uncovered: MCF&#8208;7 cells exhibit collective invasion, while MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells demonstrate an interactive mode with three functionally distinct subpopulations. A previously unknown epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mesenchymal&#8208;epithelial transition (MET) switch is We discovered during intravasation, where MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells initially increase Vimentin expression before undergoing a 2.3 fold decrease over 96 h alongside a 1.5 fold increase in epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM). Remarkably, endothelial cells directly suppress cancer cell mesenchymal properties, as evidenced by a 4.6 fold reduction in Vimentin expression compared to mono&#8208;cultures. Additionally, bilateral cancer&#8208;endothelial interactions are revealed, aggressive cancer cells induce significant intercellular adhesion molecule&#8208;1 (ICAM&#8208;1) upregulation in endothelium.

&lt;p&gt;Cancer metastasis begins with intravasation, a complex process involving cancer-endothelial interactions. INVADE (Intravasation-on-&#181;Device), a biomimetic microfluidic platform enables high-throughput analysis of intravasation under controlled conditions. This system reveals distinct invasion modes, an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) - mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) switch, and endothelial suppression of mesenchymal traits. It also uncovers bilateral signaling, highlighting dynamic cancer-endothelial crosstalk with implications for metastasis research.

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer metastasis begins with intravasation, where cancer cells enter blood vessels through complex interactions with the endothelial barrier. Understanding this process remains challenging due to the lack of physiologically relevant models. Here, INVADE (Intravasation-on-&#181;Device), a biomimetic microfluidic platform, is presented, enabling high-throughput analysis of cancer cell intravasation under controlled conditions. This engineered platform integrates 23 parallel niche chambers with an endothelialized channel, providing both precise microenvironmental control and optical accessibility for real-time visualization. Using this platform, distinct intravasation mechanisms are uncovered: MCF-7 cells exhibit collective invasion, while MDA-MB-231 cells demonstrate an interactive mode with three functionally distinct subpopulations. A previously unknown epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) switch is We discovered during intravasation, where MDA-MB-231 cells initially increase Vimentin expression before undergoing a 2.3 fold decrease over 96 h alongside a 1.5 fold increase in epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM). Remarkably, endothelial cells directly suppress cancer cell mesenchymal properties, as evidenced by a 4.6 fold reduction in Vimentin expression compared to mono-cultures. Additionally, bilateral cancer-endothelial interactions are revealed, aggressive cancer cells induce significant intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) upregulation in endothelium. The INVADE platform represents an engineering advancement for studying complex cell&#8211;cell interactions with implications for understanding metastatic mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mitigating Surface Energy and Core&#8208;Shell Interface Strain of Yb3+&#8208;Doped ZnSe&#8208;Based Quantum Dots for Pure&#8208;Blue Emission QLED Devices</title>

Breaking Quantum Confinement in Yb3&#8314;&#8208;Doped ZnSe QDs: Surface&#8208;energy engineering enables scalable growth beyond the exciton Bohr radius with high&#8208;purity blue emission (453 nm), narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 46 nm, and exceptional photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 67.5%. 








Abstract
Large ZnSe quantum dots (QDs) with an emission peak &#8776;450&#160;nm hold significant promise for display technologies. However, achieving efficient pure&#8208;blue emission through the enlargement of ZnSe nanocrystals remains a significant challenge. In this study, a breakthrough is reported in growing large&#8208;size ZnSe QDs well beyond the exciton Bohr radius through Yb3+ doping strategy. Yb3+ doping reduces the surface energy of the ZnSe (220) crystal plane and alleviates interface strain in the ZnSe/ZnS structure, enabling the QDs to grow larger while maintaining enhanced crystal stability. The resulting Yb: ZnSe/ZnS QDs exhibit pure&#8208;blue emission at 453&#160;nm, with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 46&#160;nm and a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 67.5%. When integrated into quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs), the devices display electroluminescence (EL) at 455&#160;nm, with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1.35%, and a maximum luminance of 1337.08&#160;cd m&#8722;2.

         <title>Gambogic Acid Based Coordination Polymer Reinforces High&#8208;Intensity Focused Ultrasound Treatment of Gynecologic Malignancies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>

The study developed GAZn&#8208;PEG nanoparticles&#160;(GAZn&#8208;PEG NPs) that synergize with HIFU to enhance anti&#8208;tumor immunity. GAZn&#8208;PEG NPs reduce HSP&#8208;90 expression, promote dendritic cell maturation, and activate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, amplifying immune stimulation. Combined with HIFU, GAZn&#8208;PEG NPs eradicated local tumors and induced durable systemic immunity, effectively suppressing metastasis and recurrence.









Abstract
High&#8208;intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is emerging as a promising non&#8208;invasive treatment for solid tumors. Nevertheless, HIFU may also induce the upregulation of Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP&#8208;90), potentially resulting in resistance to HIFU. Besides, although it is effective against in situ tumors, challenges remain with tumor metastasis and recurrence. Herein, the innovative design of gambogic acid (GA) based coordination polymer&#8212;GAZn&#8208;PEG nanoparticles (GAZn&#8208;PEG NPs) are synthesized through the coordination of GA with zinc ions (Zn2+), and subsequently functionalized with lipid bilayer incorporating polyethylene glycol (PEG), sensitizing HIFU for the treatment of cervical and ovarian cancers. Briefly, under HIFU exposure, GA markedly suppresses the expression of HSP&#8208;90, thereby increasing the tumor's sensitivity to HIFU therapy. Furthermore, Zn2+ not only overcome the issue of GA's poor water solubility but also synergistically stimulate immune responses in conjunction with GA. More intriguingly, it has been discovered that GAZn&#8208;PEG can effectively activate the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of the interferon genes (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway, thereby enhancing the immune responses provoked by HIFU. Specifically, GAZn&#8208;PEG NPs show a remarkable increase in dendritic cell activation and the effective stimulation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, crucial for long&#8208;term protection against tumor recurrence and metastasis.

         <title>On&#8208;Chip Active Non&#8208;Reciprocal Topological Photonics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;compact and efficient on&#8208;chip isolator is experimentally demonstrated by integrating magneto&#8208;optical InSb onto a terahertz silicon topological chip. The simultaneous breaking of spatial and temporal reversal symmetries forms a valley&#8208;conserved non&#8208;reciprocal waveguide mode, enabling a compact cavity size of 6.4 &#215; 2.5&#955;2 and a low insertion loss of 2.6 dB, with actively tunable isolation ratios up to 64.3 dB.








Abstract
Chip&#8208;scale non&#8208;reciprocity is essential for advancing integrated photonics, particularly in realizing photonic circulators and isolators for data communication, signal modulation, and quantum computing. However, achieving a non&#8208;reciprocal silicon chip with a small footprint, high isolation ratio, low loss, and active control remains a challenge. Here, a non&#8208;reciprocal topological silicon chip based on magneto&#8208;optical Indium Antimonide (InSb) integrated valley Hall system is reported. The valley&#8208;conserved non&#8208;reciprocal modes, realized by breaking both time&#8208;reversal and spatial&#8208;inversion symmetries, enable ultra&#8208;compact and efficient non&#8208;reciprocal photonic devices that outperform conventional chips. A maximum isolation ratio of 64.3&#160;dB and a low chip loss of 2.6&#160;dB is experimentally achieved by fine&#8208;tuning the non&#8208;reciprocal critical coupling points of a topological cavity with a small footprint of 6.4 &#215; 2.5&#955;2. An all&#8208;optical method is also applied to actively modulate the isolation ratio from 0 to 48&#160;dB. The development of a non&#8208;reciprocal topological silicon chip marks a pivotal advancement in communication systems, LiDAR, terahertz technologies, quantum computing, and cryptography.

         <title>Spontaneous Twist of Ferroelectric Smectic Blocks in Polar Fluids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral ground state of ferroelectric smectric is discovered which emerges in an achiral rod mesogen. This is not due to the torque&#8208;driven effect on the surface. The research confirms that the polar smectric blocks are twisted despite its high elasticity. Such a structure is predominantly generated in molecules with larger dipole moments, smaller dipole angles, and smaller aspect ratios.








Abstract
In soft matter, the polar orientational order of molecules can facilitate the coexistence of structural chirality and ferroelectricity. The ferroelectric nematic (NF) state, exhibited by achiral calamitic molecules with large dipole moments, serves as an ideal model for the emergence of spontaneous structural chirality. This chiral ground state arises from a left&#8208; or right&#8208;handed twist of polarization due to depolarization effects. In contrast, the ferroelectric smectic state, characterized by a polar lamellar structure with lower symmetry, experiences significantly higher energy associated with layer&#8208;twisting deformations and the formation of domain walls, thus avoiding a continuously twisted layered structure. In this study, two types of achiral molecules (BOE&#8208;NO2 and DIOLT) are reported that possess different molecular structures but exhibit a NF&#8211;ferroelectric smectic phase sequence. It is demonstrated that the chiral ground state of NF is inherited in the ferroelectric smectic phases of BOE&#8208;NO2, which features larger dipole moments and a steric hindrance moiety, thereby triggering the formation of the twisted polar smectic blocks.

&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;DIOLT&lt;/b&gt;) are reported that possess different molecular structures but exhibit a N&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;ferroelectric smectic phase sequence. It is demonstrated that the chiral ground state of N&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is inherited in the ferroelectric smectic phases of &lt;b&gt;BOE-NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, which features larger dipole moments and a steric hindrance moiety, thereby triggering the formation of the twisted polar smectic blocks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Suppression of Stacking Faults for Stable Formamidinium&#8208;Rich Perovskite Absorbers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors show that the (011)C perovskite planes are prone to stacking faults formation in all leading formamidinium&#8208;rich perovskite compositions. Using ethylene thiourea as a precursor additive, Othman et&#160;al. suppress those vulnerable facets, significantly enhancing the absorber's intrinsic stability under various operational conditions.









Abstract
The poor intrinsic perovskite absorber stability is arguably a central limitation challenging the prospect of commercialization for photovoltaic (PV) applications. Understanding the nanoscopic structural features that trigger instabilities in perovskite materials is essential to mitigate device degradation. Using nanostructure characterization techniques, we observe the local degradation to be initiated by material loss at stacking faults, forming inherently in the (011)&#8208;faceted perovskite domains in different formamidinium lead triiodide perovskite compositions. We introduce Ethylene Thiourea (ETU) as an additive into the perovskite precursor, which manipulates the perovskite crystal growth and results in dominantly in&#8208;and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (001) oriented perovskite domains. Combining in&#8208;depth experimental analysis and density functional theory calculations, we find that ETU lowered the perovskite formation energy, readily enabling crystallization of the perovskite phase at room temperature without the need for an antisolvent quenching step. This facilitated the fabrication of high&#8208;quality large area 5 cm by 5 cm blade&#8208;coated perovskite films and devices. Encapsulated and unmasked ETU&#8208;treated devices, with an active area of 0.2 cm2, retained &gt; 93 % of their initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) for &gt; 2100 hours at room temperature, and additionally, 1 cm2 ETU&#8208;treated devices maintained T80 (the duration for the PCE to decay to 80 % of the initial value) for &gt; 600 hours at 65 &#176;C, under continuous 1&#8208;sun illumination at the maximum power point in ambient conditions. Our demonstration of scalable and stable perovskite solar cells represents a promising step towards achieving a reliable perovskite PV technology.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance 721 nm&#8208;Excitable Photon Upconversion Porous Aromatic Frameworks for Broad&#8208;Range Oxygen Sensing and Efficient Heterogeneous Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance 721 nm&#8208;excitable solid upconversion porous aromatic frameworks (UC PAFs) was constructed and applied to a broad&#8208;range oxygen sensing and efficient heterogeneous photoredox catalysis. Moreover, homogeneous triple exciton energy is recognized to facilitate exciton diffusion, resulting in a high upconversion quantum yield (1.5% with an upper limit of 50%).








Abstract
The development of long&#8208;wavelength excitable solid upconversion materials and the regulation of exciton behavior is important for solar energy harvesting, photocatalysis, and other emerging applications. However, the approaches for regulating exciton diffusion are very limited, resulting in extremely poor photonic upconversion performance in solid&#8208;state. Here, the annihilation unit is integrated into porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) and loaded with photosensitizer to construct efficient 721 nm&#8208;excitable solid upconversion material (upconversion quantum yield up to 1.5%, upper limit 50%). Most importantly, we found that the steric hindrance of annihilator units breaks the &#960;&#8208;conjugation between the annihilation unit and the PAFs framework to form the homogeneous triplet exciton energy, which is conducive to the exciton diffusion. After increasing the exciton diffusion constant from 2.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6 to 1.34&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;5 cm2 s&#8722;1, the upconversion quantum yield is increased &#8776; 50&#8208;fold. Further, this solid upconversion material is utilized to demonstrate, for the first time, a broad&#8208;range oxygen sensing and 721 nm&#8208;driven heterogeneous and recyclable photoredox catalysis. These findings provide an important approach for regulating the behavior of triplet exciton in disorder solid materials to gain better upconversion performance, which will advance practical applications of organic photon upconversion in energy, chemistry, and photonics.

         <title>Revealing Trapped Carrier Dynamics at Buried Interfaces in Perovskite Solar Cells via Infrared&#8208;Modulated Action Spectroscopy with Surface Photovoltage Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new spectroscopy technique (i.e., pump&#8208;push&#8208;surface photovoltage) is introduced that monitors trapped carrier dynamics at the buried interfaces in perovskite solar cells (PeSCs) via combining optical trap activation by infrared light with surface photovoltage detection. The proposed new approach separates interfacial carrier&#8208;loss contributions from the top and buried surfaces, providing design insights for achieving high&#8208;performance PeSCs through interface optimization. 








Abstract
Interfacial engineering is a proven strategy to enhance the efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PeSCs) by controlling surface electronic defects and carrier trapping. The trap states at the &#8220;top&#8221; interface between the perovskite and upper charge extraction layers are experimentally accessible and have been extensively studied. However, the understanding of the unexposed &#8220;bottom&#8221; surface of the perovskite layer remains elusive, due to the lack of selective and non&#8208;destructive tools to access buried interface. Here, a new spectroscopy technique is introduced that monitors nanosecond to millisecond dynamics of trapped carriers at the buried interfaces by combining optical trap activation by infrared light with surface photovoltage detection. Applied to various PeSC architectures, this method reveals that most interfacial traps reside between the perovskite and hole transport layer, suggesting a predominance of hole traps (e.g., cation and lead vacancies) over electron traps (e.g., halide vacancies) in the studied PeSC systems. The proposed new approach separates interfacial carrier&#8208;loss contributions from the top and buried surfaces, providing design insights for achieving high&#8208;performance PeSCs through interface optimization.

         <title>Thermally Activated Swelling and Wetting Transition of Frozen Polymer Brushes:a New Concept for Surface Functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel approach is introduced that&#160;leverages polymer phase transitions to modulate brush behavior. The oleophilic bottle brush system exhibits two distinct melting transitions&#8212;bulk and surface&#8212;enabling a two&#8208;stage swelling and wetting transition. These transitions can be controlled globally, or locally with a focused laser beam, offering a new strategy for designing adaptive surfaces based on intrinsic polymer properties.









Abstract
Functional polymer brush coatings have great potential for various industrial applications thanks to their ability to adapt to environmental stimuli, providing tunable surface properties. While existing approaches rely on polymer&#8208;solvent interactions and their response to external stimuli, changes in the intrinsic physical properties of the polymer also play a critical role in modulating brush behavior. In this context, the melting transition of a semicrystalline oleophilic poly&#8208;octadecylmethacrylate (P18MA) brush coating is shown to drive a swelling and wetting transition upon exposure to various liquid alkanes. The top surface of this polymer displays a somewhat higher melting temperature than the bulk, enabling separate control of the bulk&#8208;driven swelling and surface&#8208;driven wetting transitions. Laser&#8208;induced heating enables reversible on&#8208;demand activation of both transitions with micrometer lateral resolution. These findings suggest a new concept of polymer brush&#8208;based functional surfaces that allow for controlled fluid transport via separately switchable surface barriers and bulk transport layers based on a suitable choice of polymer&#8208;polymer and polymer&#8208;solvent interactions.

         <title>Evidence of Cation Symmetry Reduction Induced Bulk Photovoltaic Effect in Metal&#8208;Free Perovskite for Efficient Self&#8208;Powered X&#8208;Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relationship between the bulk photovoltaic effect and cation symmetry is systematically investigated, leading to the first realization of a self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detector in metal&#8208;free perovskites. Reduced cation symmetry enhances both the dipole moment and crystal polarity, facilitating carrier migration while simultaneously passivating defects. Leveraging the nonlinear photocurrent response mechanism, the X&#8208;ray detector achieves ultra&#8208;high equivalent sensitivity at zero bias.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;free perovskite (MFP) X&#8208;ray detectors have attracted attention due to biocompatibility and synthesizability. However, the necessity of high voltages for MFP X&#8208;ray detectors affects stability and safety. Although, the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) with spontaneous electric field is a potential alternative for X&#8208;ray detection without high voltage, the constitutive relationship of BPVE in MFP remains unclear. Herein, the relationship between BPVE and cation symmetry is explored, and a self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detector is realized by BPVE in MFP for the first time. Theoretical studies show that cation symmetry reduction can distort the halide octahedron in one direction, which increases the dipole moment and crystal polarity to induce BPVE. The electric field from crystal polarity can drive the defect passivation by the equilibrium carrier and enhance the nonequilibrium carrier performance for BPVE. Then, polar MFP (mPAZE&#8208;NH4Br3 H2O) with excellent BPVE is designed. Due to the nonlinear response, the detector obtains a numerically recorded equivalent sensitivity (&#8776;103 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) at 0&#160;V. Moreover, the imaging performance is demonstrated and two image convolution kernels for it are constructed. Finally, it features continuous operation (20000 s) and temperature stability (&#8208;55&#8211;250 &#176;C). It is believed that the method will further drive the application of MFP for X&#8208;ray detectors.

         <title>Electron Extraction Optimization for Carbon&#8208;Based Hole&#8208;Conductor&#8208;Free Perovskite Photovoltaics With Record 1.41&#160;V VOC</title>

A gradient electron energy level strategy is constructed to reduce voltage losses in planar HTL&#8208;free CsPbI2Br C&#8208;PSCs. This electron extraction optimization enables rapid photogenerated electron extraction and carrier separation, thereby suppressing recombination at the back contact. The resulting PSCs deliver a record VOC of 1.41 V, a high PCE of 17.42% and a high stability, simultaneously.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based CsPbI2Br perovskite solar cells (PSCs) free of a hole&#8208;transport layer (HTL) have emerged as promising photovoltaics due to their low processing cost and superior stability. However, the voltage deficit resulting from inefficient carrier extraction causes insufficient power conversion efficiency (PCE), severely hindering their progress. Here, a gradient electron energy level modulation strategy proves effective in reducing voltage losses through the rapid extraction of photogenerated electrons. This process enhances carrier separation/collection and reduces recombination at the back contact, thereby achieving high&#8208;performance photovoltaics. It is demonstrated that the front electron extraction, equally critical as the prevailing back perovskite/carbon contact, accounts for the significant contributing factor of voltage deficit in carbon&#8208;based HTL&#8208;free PSCs. The resulting PSCs deliver a record open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.41&#160;V and a PCE of 17.42% and retain more than 92% of their initial efficiency after 1, 000&#160;h. These results highlight the significant potential of carbon&#8208;based HTL&#8208;free perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Time&#8208;Division Multiplexing Physical Unclonable Functions Based on Multicolor Phosphorescent Carbon Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A time&#8208;division multiplexing physical unclonable function (TDM&#8208;PUF) label based on multicolor phosphorescent carbon dots (CDs) is proposed, which leverages the variations in wavelengths and lifetimes of the phosphorescent CDs to construct time&#8208;resolved multidimensional cryptographic protocols. This study provides a competitive anti&#8208;counterfeiting label and inspires the development of novel anti&#8208;counterfeiting strategies.








Abstract
Phosphorescent materials offer a promising approach to information encryption due to their long luminescence lifetimes and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios. However, fixed phosphorescent patterns are vulnerable to imitation over time, limiting their effectiveness in advanced encryption. Here, a time&#8208;division multiplexing physical unclonable function (TDM&#8208;PUF) label utilizing multicolor phosphorescent carbon dots (CDs) is proposed that leverages variations in wavelength and lifetime to construct time&#8208;resolved, multidimensional cryptographic protocols. Efficient multi&#8208;color phosphorescence in CDs is achieved by enhancing intersystem crossing, suppressing non&#8208;radiative transitions through confinement effects, and regulating emission spectra via energy transfer. The random spatial distribution and unpredictable emissions of phosphorescent CDs significantly enhance the complexity of the PUF system, thereby fortifying its defenses against mimicry attacks. Furthermore, this PUF system exhibits multiple optical responses over time, allowing correct information recognition only at specified time nodes, achieving time&#8208;resolved anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Finally, by segmenting PUF labels based on emission color and time channels, non&#8208;overlapping multicolor and multi&#8208;time segments are achieved, enabling highly secure time&#8208;division multiplexed encryption. The study provides a competitive anti&#8208;counterfeiting label and inspires the development of novel anti&#8208;counterfeiting strategies.

The porous single&#8208;crystalline MoN integrates the structural features, suitable hydrogen adsorption energy, high electronic conductivity and intrinsic catalytic activity, demonstrating low Tafel slopes, minimal charge transfer resistances and long&#8208;term stability across all&#8208;pH conditions, significantly surpassing traditional Pt/C electrodes.








Abstract
Platinum is widely used in the important components in most electrochemical energy conversion systems while as a noble metal it faces the inevitable challenge of limited reserves. Herein, porous single&#8211;crystalline (PSC) molybdenum nitride (MoN) monoliths are reported at the centimeter scale that surpass platinum for all&#8211;pH hydrogen evolution. Free&#8211;standing PSC MoN electrode with the pore size of &#8776;6&#160;nm and porosity of &#8776;72% present both noble&#8211;metal&#8211;like electronic structure and unsaturated Mo&#9472;N coordination structures at surface, contributing to remarkably high intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. The unprecedented overpotentials of as low as 13 and 11&#160;mV are presented at the geometrical current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for hydrogen evolution in H2SO4 (pH 0) and KOH (pH 14) media, respectively, which is dramatically superior to commercial Pt electrodes. As a result of the structural stability, the outstanding long&#8211;term durability for all pH hydrogen evolution is demonstrated without visible degradation in a continuous operation for 300&#160;h.

         <title>Energy Transfer Loop Enables Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence with &gt;20% EQE and Near&#8208;Zero Roll&#8208;Offs at 104 Nits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence diodes with the record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.8% and the record&#8208;low EQE roll&#8208;off of only 2.6% at 104 nits is first realized through an &#8220;energy transfer loop&#8221; strategy, in which a TADF sensitizer 24DDMACPPPO with vibration&#8208;free reverse intersystem crossing is used to displace TADF emitter in triplet&#8208;singlet up&#8208;conversion for phonon decoupling, leading to markedly enhanced radiation and suppressed quenching.








Abstract
The bottleneck in efficiency stability at high luminance limits the development of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) diodes, due to the insufficient management of quenching factors, especially exciton&#8208;phonon coupling during reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) assistant with vibrational coupling. Herein, this challenge is overcome by a TADF sensitizer based &#8220;energy transfer loop&#8221; strategy. A dimethylacridine&#8208;phosphole oxide hybrid sensitizer named 24DDMACPPPO is constructed with vibration&#8208;free RISC and excited&#8208;state energy levels equal to a TADF emitter 4CzTPNBu. The former displaces the latter in RISC for phonon decoupling through reverse triplet and positive singlet energy transfer between them. As a result, co&#8208;doping 0&#160;.1%wt. 24DDMACPPPO doubles the RISC rate constant and triples the singlet radiation rate of 4CzTPNBu, and simultaneously nearly halves non&#8208;radiation rate constants, giving rise to 70% and 90% increased photo&#8208; and electro&#8208;luminescence quantum efficiencies of 4CzTPNBu. More importantly, the energy transfer loop between 24DDMACPPPO and 4CzTPNBu combines their advantages in RISC, quenching suppression, and singlet radiation, giving rise to the record values of external quantum efficiency (&#8776;23%wt.) and roll&#8208;off (2.6%) at 104&#160;cd m&#8722;2.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Large&#8208;Area Perovskite Solar Cells via a Multifunctional Crystallization Regulating Passivation Additive</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chlorine&#8208;substituted aromatic polycyclic compound is introduced into perovskite solar cells to regulate perovskite crystallization, passivate various defects, and enhance hole transport at the HTL/perovskite interface. This approach achieved high efficiencies of 25.04% for 1 cm2 cells and 22.81% for 12 cm2 modules, with excellent stability (maintaining 80% of initial efficiency after 2500 h of MPP tracking under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 standards).








Abstract
Film morphology and surface/interface defect density play a critical role in determining the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, a chlorine&#8208;substituted aromatic polycyclic derivative (BNCl) is reported, which shows strong interaction with both lead iodide and dimethyl sulfoxide, to regulate the crystallization of perovskite, along with effective passivation of grain boundaries and surface. In addition, the extruded BNCl molecule at the hole transport layer (HTL)/perovskite interface can facilitate the hole transport, leading to better charge transfer. As a result, certified power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25.04% and 22.81% are achieved for PSCs and minimodules with aperture areas of 1 cm2 and 12 cm2 respectively. In addition, the device maintained 80% of its initial efficiency after 2500 h of maximum power point (MPP) tracking under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 standard.

         <title>Synergistic Interface Engineering via o&#8208;Difluorobenzene&#8208;Mediated HPWO Crystallization and ITO Fluorination for 20.57% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;action optimization strategy is developed combining the fluorination of ITO electrodes with precisely controlled crystallization of phosphotungstic acid, which establishes favorable energy level alignment and reduces interface trap density to obtain 20.57% efficiency of organic solar cells.








Abstract
Interfacial energy loss is a critical challenge in achieving high&#8208;efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs), primarily due to mismatched energy levels and inefficient charge collection. Herein, a bifunctional interface engineering strategy is proposed, employing an ethanol/o&#8208;difluorobenzene (EtOH/o&#8208;DFB) dual&#8208;solvent system for phosphotungstic acid (HPWO) processing. During film formation, o&#8208;DFB regulates HPWO crystallization by suppressing excessive aggregation, while enabling in situ ITO fluorination through the adsorbed o&#8208;DFB. This synergistic approach simultaneously mitigates the trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination at the hole transport layer while enhancing the electrode work function, resulting in better ohmic contact, minimized trap&#8208;state densities, and improved energy level alignment at the electrode/active layer interface. The effectiveness of this strategy is demonstrated across multiple active layer systems. Remarkable power conversion efficiencies of 19.55%, 20.07%, and 20.57% are achieved for PM6/L8&#8208;BO, D18/L8&#8208;BO, and D18/BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based OSCs, respectively. Notably, the 20.57% PCE represents one of the highest efficiencies reported to date for OSCs, highlighting the potential of this bifunctional interface engineering strategy in advancing high&#8208;performance organic photovoltaics.

         <title>O, S, and N Bridged Atoms Screening on 2D Conjugated Central Units of High&#8208;Performance Acceptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
O, S, and N atoms are adopted to bridge the 2D conjugated central cores, yielding three acceptors of CH&#9472;O, CH&#9472;S, and CH&#9472;N. CH&#9472;N&#8208;based device affords the highest fill factor of 83.13% in organic photovoltaics and the first&#8208;class binary device efficiency of 20.23%.








Abstract
Almost all of central cores in high&#8208;performance acceptors are limited to the electron&#8208;withdrawing diimide structure currently, which constrains further acceptor structural innovation greatly. Herein, oxygen (O), sulfur (S), and nitrogen (N) atoms are adopted to bridge the 2D conjugated central cores, yielding three acceptor platforms of CH&#9472;O, CH&#9472;S, and CH&#9472;N that differ in structure by only two atoms. Because of the characteristic atomic outer electron configuration and hybrid orbital orientation, O&#8208;, S&#8208;, and N&#8208;bridged central cores display quite different conformations and electronic properties, namely, dibenzodioxin (planar, non&#8208;aromatic), thianthrene (puckered, non&#8208;aromatic) and phenazine (planar, aromatic), respectively. A systematic investigation discloses how the central core, especially its p&#8208;&#960; orbital overlap between lone pair on O/S/N and coterminous benzene planes, affect the intrinsic photoelectronic properties of acceptors for the first time. Finally, CH&#9472;N&#8208;based binary device affords the highest fill factor of 83.13% in organic photovoltaics along with a first&#8208;class efficiency of 20.23%. By evaluating the strictly controlled O&#8208;, S&#8208;, and N&#8208;bridged molecular platforms comprehensively, the work reveals the potential uniqueness of diimide in determining the excellent photovoltaic outcomes of acceptors.

&lt;p&gt;O, S, and N atoms are adopted to bridge the 2D conjugated central cores, yielding three acceptors of CH&#9472;O, CH&#9472;S, and CH&#9472;N. CH&#9472;N-based device affords the highest fill factor of 83.13% in organic photovoltaics and the first-class binary device efficiency of 20.23%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all of central cores in high-performance acceptors are limited to the electron-withdrawing diimide structure currently, which constrains further acceptor structural innovation greatly. Herein, oxygen (O), sulfur (S), and nitrogen (N) atoms are adopted to bridge the 2D conjugated central cores, yielding three acceptor platforms of CH&#9472;O, CH&#9472;S, and CH&#9472;N that differ in structure by only two atoms. Because of the characteristic atomic outer electron configuration and hybrid orbital orientation, O-, S-, and N-bridged central cores display quite different conformations and electronic properties, namely, dibenzodioxin (planar, non-aromatic), thianthrene (puckered, non-aromatic) and phenazine (planar, aromatic), respectively. A systematic investigation discloses how the central core, especially its p-&#960; orbital overlap between lone pair on O/S/N and coterminous benzene planes, affect the intrinsic photoelectronic properties of acceptors for the first time. Finally, CH&#9472;N-based binary device affords the highest fill factor of 83.13% in organic photovoltaics along with a first-class efficiency of 20.23%. By evaluating the strictly controlled O-, S-, and N-bridged molecular platforms comprehensively, the work reveals the potential uniqueness of diimide in determining the excellent photovoltaic outcomes of acceptors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Microbial Photosynthetic Oxygenation and Radiotherapeutic Sensitization Enables Pyroptosis Induction for Combinatorial Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the preparation of lanthanum oxide nanoparticles (La2O3 NPs) via a solid&#8208;phase synthesis method, combined with cyanobacteria (Cyan) to effectively alleviate hypoxia. These components are confined within the tumor microenvironment using a thermosensitive hydrogel, enhancing the sensitivity of radiotherapy for colorectal and lung cancers. By alleviating hypoxia through cyanobacteria&#8208;mediated photosynthetic oxygenation, La2O3 NPs not only promote reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, triggering pyroptosis via GSDMD activation, but also amplify radiotherapy&#8208;induced pyroptosis mediated by GSDME. This dual mechanism provides a powerful strategy to overcome hypoxia&#8208;induced radiotherapy resistance in colorectal and lung cancers.








Abstract
Rectal cancer surgery is challenging due to the complex anatomy, making it difficult to achieve clear surgical margins. Radiotherapy (RT) plays a crucial role, especially in treating locally recurrent rectal cancer and preserving anal function. However, its effectiveness is often limited by tumor hypoxia, particularly prevalent in hypoxic regions near the bowel wall in colorectal cancer. Hypoxia contributes to both radiation resistance and apoptosis resistance, compromising RT outcomes. To overcome hypoxia&#8208;driven radiotherapy resistance, this work designs and engineers a radiotherapy&#8208;sensitizing bioplatform for efficient cancer RT. It combines lanthanum oxide nanoparticles (La2O3 NPs) with cyanobacteria, which produces oxygen through photosynthesis. This bioplatform uniquely reduces tumor hypoxia, enhances radiation deposition, and improves RT efficacy. La2O3 NPs further enhance reactive oxygen species (ROS) production induced by radiation, triggering pyroptosis via the ROS&#8208;NLRP3&#8208;GSDMD pathway, while RT amplifies pyroptosis through GSDME, circumventing tumor apoptosis resistance. The further integrated thermosensitive hydrogels ensure precise localization of the bioplatform, reducing systemic toxicity and improving therapeutic specificity. Compared to conventional therapies, this dual&#8208;action system addresses hypoxia, RT resistance, and apoptosis resistance more effectively. In vivo and in vitro hypoxia models validate its potent anti&#8208;tumor efficacy, offering valuable insights for refining clinical treatment paradigms.

         <title>AI&#8208;Generated Ammonium Ligands for High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable 2D/3D Heterojunction Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine learning procedure combined with an artificial intelligence (AI) model are used to accelerate the generation of ammonium ligands (ALs) in 2D perovskites. The relationship between the carrier transport barrier and the structure of ALs is explored. Utilizing the AI&#8208;designed ALs significantly enhances the carrier transport of the 2D perovskites, leading to high&#8208;efficiency and stable 2D/3D perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
The 2D/3D heterojunction perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exhibit remarkable stability, but the quantum well in the 2D perovskite capping layer hinders the carrier transport, thereby lowering the power conversion efficiency (PCE). The relationship between the transport barrier and the complex structure of ammonium ligands (ALs) is currently poorly understood, thus leading to the one&#8208;sided approach and inefficient process in the development of 2D perovskite. Here, a machine learning procedure is established to comprehensively explore the relationship and combined it with an artificial intelligence (AI) model based on reinforcement learning algorithm to accelerate the generation of ALs. Finally, the AI&#8208;designed ALs improved the carrier transport performance of the 2D perovskite capping layer, and we achieved a certified PCE of 26.12% in inverted PSCs. The devices retained 96.79% of the initial PCE after 2000 h operation in maximum power point tracking under 1&#8208;sun illumination at 85&#176;C.

         <title>Highly Defective Ultrafine Carbon Nanoreactors Enriched with Edge&#8208;Type Zn&#8208;N3P1 Moiety Boosting Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mesoporous&#8208;dominant carbon nanoreactor is designed with dimensions in the range of 15&#8211;43 nm with edge&#8208;rich defective atomic Zn sites. The crystal size and pore diameter of this carbon nanoreactors can be precisely adjusted to enable tunable mass diffusion pathways and porosities. The hydrophobic nature of 25 nm nanoreactors maximizes the nonkinetic advantages of active site exposure and rapid O2 mass transfer at the triple&#8208;phase interface.








Abstract
High&#8208;active nonplatinum group metal oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts have great potential to improve fuel cell and metal&#8211;air battery performance due to their efficiency and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, a fundamental understanding of their size&#8208;dependent structure&#8211;performance relationships remain elusive. Here a mesoporous&#8208;dominant carbon nanoreactor with dimensions in the range of 15&#8211;43 nm with edge&#8208;rich defective atomic Zn sites is designed. The crystal size and pore diameter of this carbon nanoreactors can be precisely adjusted to enable tunable mass diffusion pathways and porosities. Importantly, the hydrophobic nature of 25 nm nanoreactors maximizes the nonkinetic advantages of active site exposure and rapid O2 mass transfer at the triple&#8208;phase interface. The developed Zn&#8208;N&#8208;P/NPC catalysts delivers outstanding alkaline and acidic ORR performance with half&#8208;wave potentials of 0.92 and 0.80 V, respectively, as well as excellent zinc&#8211;air battery performance with charge/discharge over 400 h under 20 mA cm&#8722;2. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations indicate that the enhanced ORR catalytic activity of Zn&#8208;N&#8208;P/NPC stems from the introduction of P atoms and edge carbon defects effectively exciting the localized electronic asymmetric distribution of Zn species. The findings provide new perspectives on the size effect of porous carbon supports for the development of efficient cathodes catalysts with multifunctionality.

         <title>Customized Multifunctional Additive Regulates 1.67 eV&#8208;Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Crystallization for Four&#8208;Terminal Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A doping strategy of incorporating Bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo)benzene (BTFIB) additive in 1.67 eV WBG perovskite precursor has been proposed to passivate uncoordinated lead ions and iodide vacancies and retard the crystallization of perovskite. Finally, BTFIB&#8208;based perovskite solar cells yielded a champion efficiency of 23.05% (certified 22.21%) and enabled a four&#8208;terminal perovskite/Si tandem cell with a PCE of 31.20% and excellent long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs, Eg &gt;&#160;1.6&#160;eV), serving as the top cell in perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (PSTSCs), play an indispensable role in absorbing high energy photons and increasing overall efficiency. However, WBG PSCs often suffer from severe light&#8208;induced phase segregation and significant non&#8208;radiative recombination losses due to uncontrolled rapid crystallization. Here, polyfluoride molecular additives are designed and incorporated via (diacetoxyiodo)benzene into WBG perovskite, to regulate crystallization process of perovskite films and thereby reduce defects. (Bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo)benzene (BTFIB) can passivate uncoordinated lead ions and iodide vacancies, thereby inhibiting phase separation caused by iodide migration and reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination loss during charge transport. Moreover, the introduction of BTFIB can effectively moderate the film formation process and confer excellent hydrophobic properties to the films. Consequently, BTFIB&#8208;based 1.67 eV&#8208;WBG perovskite devices yield a champion efficiency of 23.05% (certified efficiency of 22.21%), enabling a 31.20% efficiency in four&#8208;terminal PSTSCs, along with excellent open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.246&#160;V and fill factor of 85.34%. After 2500&#160;h of aging in a glovebox, the device retained 80% of its initial efficiency.

&lt;p&gt;Wide-bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs, E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt;&#160;1.6&#160;eV), serving as the top cell in perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (PSTSCs), play an indispensable role in absorbing high energy photons and increasing overall efficiency. However, WBG PSCs often suffer from severe light-induced phase segregation and significant non-radiative recombination losses due to uncontrolled rapid crystallization. Here, polyfluoride molecular additives are designed and incorporated via (diacetoxyiodo)benzene into WBG perovskite, to regulate crystallization process of perovskite films and thereby reduce defects. (Bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo)benzene (BTFIB) can passivate uncoordinated lead ions and iodide vacancies, thereby inhibiting phase separation caused by iodide migration and reducing non-radiative recombination loss during charge transport. Moreover, the introduction of BTFIB can effectively moderate the film formation process and confer excellent hydrophobic properties to the films. Consequently, BTFIB-based 1.67 eV-WBG perovskite devices yield a champion efficiency of 23.05% (certified efficiency of 22.21%), enabling a 31.20% efficiency in four-terminal PSTSCs, along with excellent open-circuit voltage of 1.246&#160;V and fill factor of 85.34%. After 2500&#160;h of aging in a glovebox, the device retained 80% of its initial efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atomic Insights Into Self&#8208;Assembly of Zingibroside R1 and its Therapeutic Action Against Fungal Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>

Cryo&#8208;EM reveals Zingibroside R1 (ZR1) undergoes self&#8208;assemble helical nanofibrils. The hydrogen&#8208;bonding interface between ZR1 nanofibrils and glucan compromises membrane integrity, inhibiting C. albicans proliferation in vitro and in vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) model mice in vivo. ZR1 gel could also deliver probiotic Lactobacillus to restore the vaginal microenvironment, synergistically inhibiting VVC.








Abstract
Natural products are a crucial resource for drug discovery, but poor understanding of the molecular&#8208;scale mechanisms of their self&#8208;assembly into soluble, bioavailable hydrogels limits their applications and therapeutic potential. It is demonstrated that Zingibroside R1 (ZR1), derived from Panax notoginseng, undergoes spontaneous self&#8208;assemble into a hydrogel comprising helical nanofibrils with potent antifungal activity lacking in its monomeric state. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;EM) revealed an intricate hydrogen&#8208;bonding network that facilitates ZR1 nanofibril formation, characterized by a hydrophobic core and hydrophilic exterior architecture, which underpin its binding activity with cell wall in the vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) pathogen, C. albicans. The hydrogen&#8208;bonding interface between ZR1 gel and glucan compromises membrane integrity, inhibiting C. albicans proliferation in vitro and in VVC model mice in vivo. ZR1 gel could also deliver probiotic Lactobacillus, synergistically inhibiting VVC and restoring the vaginal microenvironment. This study advances the mechanistic understanding of ZR1's structure&#8208;function relationships, offering valuable insights into the rational design and therapeutic optimization of natural product&#8208;based hydrogels.

         <title>Optimization of Core&#8211;Shell Ternary Electrodes for High&#8208;Performance Ionic Actuator in Soft Gripper</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8211;shell ternary electrode (Opt&#8208;SWCNTs/PEDOT:PSS/IL) is developed via a simple two&#8208;step dispersion and vacuum filtration process, with component ratios optimized to achieve excellent mechanical toughness and electrical conductivity based on simulation results. The resulting actuators demonstrate high strain and blocking force, enabling precise gripping and complex deformation, showing great potential for soft robotics and next&#8208;generation electrochemical actuators.








Abstract
Ionic actuators based on composite electrodes consisting of nanomaterials and conducting polymer typically offer the advantages of low&#8208;voltage operation and high stability, however, electrode preparation using conventional mixing suffers from issues of ineffective dispersion of nanomaterials, greatly diminishing their synergistic effects. Here, the ternary electrode system based on SWCNTs/PEDOT: PSS/ionic liquid using the two&#8208;step dispersion process is optimized, achieving a uniformly coated core&#8211;shell structure with high conductivity (&#8776;392.4 S cm&#8722;1). The ions migration process is analyzed according to the core&#8211;shell model, further optimization of the ternary electrode and device structure enables the actuator to realize the peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak strain per volt reaching 1.3% V&#8722;1 and normalized blocking force of 0.15&#160;MPa V&#8722;1 (&#8776;89.2 times its own weight), with stable performance maintained over 1 million cycles. Therefore, the actuator can be utilized for the assembly of multi&#8208;clawed grippers to grasp precision components or larger objects. Multiple connected actuators fulfill a complex deformation, indicating promising applications in smart grippers, bioinspired robotics, and human&#8211;machine interaction.

         <title>Interstitial&#8208;Substitutional&#8208;Mixed Solid Solution of RuO2 Nurturing a New Pathway Beyond the Activity&#8208;Stability Linear Constraint in Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An AEM&#8208;derived proton acceptor&#8208;electron donor mechanism is proposed in RuO2 by constructing an interstitial&#8208;substitutional mixed solid solution structure (C,Ta&#8208;RuO2), in which the interstitial C as the proton acceptor decreases the deprotonation energy barrier, while the substitutional Ta as the electron donor weakens the Ru&#9472;O bond covalency, thereby breaking the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off of RuO2 in acidic OER.








Abstract
The acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts for proton exchange membrane electrolyzer (PEMWE) often face a trade&#8208;off between activity and stability due to inherent linear relationship and overoxidation of metal atoms in highly oxidative environments, while following the conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM). Herein, a favorable AEM&#8208;derived proton acceptor&#8208;electron donor mechanism (PAEDM) is proposed in RuO2 by constructing interstitial&#8208;substitutional mixed solid solution structure (denoted as C,Ta&#8208;RuO2), which can effectively break the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off of RuO2 in acidic OER. In situ spectroscopy experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the interstitial C as the proton acceptor reduces the deprotonation energy barrier, enhancing catalytic activity, while the substitutional Ta as the electron donor donates electrons to the Ru sites via bridging oxygen, weakening the Ru&#9472;O bond covalency and preventing over&#8208;oxidation of surface Ru, thereby ensuring long&#8208;term stability. Under the guidance of this mechanism, the optimized C,Ta&#8208;RuO2 simultaneously achieves far low overpotential (&#951;10 = 171&#160;mV) and ultra&#8208;long stability (over 1300&#160;h) for the acidic OER. More remarkably, a homemade PEMWE using C,Ta&#8208;RuO2 as the anode also shows high water splitting performance (1.63&#160;V@1 A cm&#8722;2). This work supplies a novel strategy to guide future developments on efficient OER electrocatalysts toward water oxidation.

         <title>Direct Recycling of Spent LiFePO4 Cathodes Through Photocatalytic Correction of Anti&#8208;Site Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We employ photocatalysis to decrease the iron migration barrier, enabling the repositioning of disordered iron atoms into their designated octahedral sites while simultaneously facilitating Li+ diffusion into the LFP lattice, thereby realizing the direct recovery of S&#8208;LFP. This method has substantial environmental and economic benefits, making it a promising solution for sustainable lithium&#8208;ion battery recycling.








Abstract
Fe&#8208;Li (FeLi) anti&#8208;site defects, commonly observed in degraded LiFePO4 cathodes, impede Li+ mobility and disrupt the electronic pathways, leading to significant performance degradation in LFP. However, addressing FeLi anti&#8208;site defects to achieve direct recycling of LFP remains challenging due to Fe high migration energy barriers and the lattice distortions they induce. Here, a feasible strategy is proposed for LFP regeneration by utilizing photocatalysis to reduce the Fe migration barrier. This approach facilitates repositioning disordered Fe atoms to their designated octahedral sites while simultaneously enabling Li+ diffusion into the LFP lattice, thus restoring capacity and ensuring cycling stability. The mechanism of the photocatalysis regeneration strategy is comprehensively analyzed through a combination of theoretical calculations, in&#8208;depth atomic characterization techniques, and electrochemical evaluations. Notably, this strategy is adaptable to varying levels of FeLi anti&#8208;site defects in spent LFP. Furthermore, life cycle analysis highlights the substantial environmental and economic benefits of this advanced strategy, making it a promising solution for sustainable lithium&#8208;ion battery recycling.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Fluorinated Ni Single Atom Catalyst for Efficient Artificial Photosynthetic Diluted CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, synergistic spatial and electronic structure regulation of conjugated Ni single&#8208;atom catalysts are achieved through a dual&#8208;fluorination strategy. Under diluted CO2 (10%) atmosphere, TPB&#8208;SA2F&#8208;Ni obtains the highest reported CO yield (30344.4 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) among heterogeneous catalytic systems with 98% CO selectivity.








Abstract
The development of efficient photocatalysts to convert dilute CO2 from flue gas into high value&#8208;added products is a promising approach to achieving carbon neutrality. In this work, a dual&#8208;fluorinated Ni single atom photocatalyst is reported for the photoreduction of diluted CO2 to CO. Under a dilute CO2 (10%) atmosphere, TPB&#8208;SA2F&#8208;Ni achieves the highest reported CO yield (30344.4&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1) among heterogeneous catalytic systems with a CO selectivity of 98%. Kevin probe force microscopy and photoelectrochemical characterizations indicate that dual&#8208;fluorination strategy enhances photoexcited electron transfer between the photosensitizer and photocatalyst by optimizing the conjugated electronic structure. Pore size distribution and CO2 adsorption experiments show that the uniform microporous structure induced by the dual&#8208;F site further enhanced the ability of the Ni&#8208;N2O2 active site to capture CO2 molecules. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the high CO yield of TPB&#8208;SA2F&#8208;Ni stems from a lowered energy barrier for *COOH intermediate formation.

         <title>Direct Experimental Evidence of Low Carrier Scattering Potential in High Performance Thermoelectric AgSbSe2 Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of high&#8208;quality AgSb0.973Cd0.017Se2 crystals with short&#8208;range order embeds within a long&#8208;range periodic structure, achieving the synergistic optimization of both electrical and phonon transport properties. Time&#8208;resolved reflectance spectroscopy provides clear evidence of a pronounced reduction in carrier scattering barriers, leads to a threefold enhancement in the average power factor (PFavg), ultimately achieving superior thermoelectric performance.








Abstract
Thermoelectric materials, like other electronic materials, require high carrier mobility, which is governed by carrier scattering potential. In addition to intrinsic acoustic phonon scattering, the extrinsic factors such as microstructure and atomic arrangement also have great influence on carrier transport in solids, e.g., the emerging thermoelectric material AgSbSe2 with strong cation disorder. However, the experimental evaluation of total carrier scattering potential and distinguishing the contributions from intrinsic and extrinsic scatterings is challenging at present. Here, the time&#8208;resolved ultrafast spectroscopy analysis utilizing a pump&#8208;probe scheme is performed to characterize the charge carrier dynamics of AgSbSe2 with femtosecond time resolution quantitatively. A significantly lowered total carrier scattering potential energy in Cd&#8208;doped AgSbSe2 crystal is determined, resulting from the elimination of grain boundaries and the presence of short&#8208;range order that leads to a negative extrinsic scattering potential. The reduction in carrier scattering potential leads to a threefold increase in the average power factor from 323 to 723 K. A maximum thermoelectric figure of merit of 1.7 is achieved in high&#8208;quality AgSb0.973Cd0.017Se2 crystal at 723 K, with the output efficiency of the single&#8208;leg thermoelectric device reaching a competitive value of 8%. This work reveals how to effectively characterize and modulate carrier scattering potential in thermoelectric compounds.

         <title>Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Deposition of Antigen Peptides on Bifidobacterium for Subintestinal Lymphatic System&#8208;Guided Personalized Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vaccine (Bif&#8208;OVA&#8208;Ocur) is designed to target gut&#8208;associated lymphoid tissues, promoting the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and the expansion of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)&#160;at mucosal sites. This targeted approach strengthens both mucosal and systemic immunes responses. These immune responses enable the immune system to specifically recognize and destroy tumor cells, thereby inhibiting tumor growth and progression.








Abstract
Gut&#8208;associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) possesses a highly specialized immune system and is rational as a foothold for oral tumor vaccines. Here, a noninvasive oral vaccine (Bif&#8208;OVA&#8208;Ocur) is designed to engage GALT, inducing both intestinal mucosal and systemic immunity for tumor therapeutics. The vaccine uses Bifidobacterium (Bif) as a delivery vehicle for tumor antigen peptides, which are coated with antigen peptides (OVA) and oxidized curdlan (Ocur) in a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) manner. Upon oral administration, Bif&#8208;OVA&#8208;Ocur is efficiently directed to Peyer's patches (PPs) in the intestines and further presented to antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs), which then migrate to the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) to evoke specific T cell responses. In mouse models, Bif&#8208;OVA&#8208;Ocur effectively boosts the production of secretory immunoglobin A (SIgA) and promotes a strong mucosal and systemic immune response, leading to significant tumor suppression and resistance to tumor challenges. Importantly, the vaccine shows no systemic toxicity. This approach to harnessing the intestinal mucosal immune system offers valuable insights for the development of other non&#8208;invasive oral vaccines and therapeutic agents.

         <title>Thermo&#8208;Electric&#8208;Mechanical Coupling Selects Barrier Layer for Advanced Bismuth Telluride Thermoelectric Generator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermo&#8208;electric&#8208;mechanical coupling strategy proposed here predicts the feasibility of Ni2SbTe2 and NiTe2 as ideal TEbMs for (Bi,Sb)2Te3 and Bi2(Te,Se)3, based on three&#8208;phase thermodynamic equilibrium, electrical resistivity, and CTE compatibility. The fabricated TE generators demonstrate a third&#8208;party&#8208;verified conversion efficiency of 7.1% and a power density of 0.49 W cm&#8722;2 when the hot&#8208;side temperature is 523 K, with negligible degradation over 200 h.








Abstract
The long&#8208;term stability of thermoelectric generators, including those based on Bi2Te3, is hindered by the lack of ideal thermoelectric barrier materials (TEbMs). Conventional selection methods for TEbMs mainly rely on trial&#8208;and&#8208;error, which is time&#8208;consuming and does not reveal the underlying mechanisms. In this study, a new design principle for selecting TEbMs based on thermo&#8211;electric&#8211;mechanical coupling is proposed. By combining the phase diagram predictions with the thermal expansion coefficients and electrical resistivities of the potential reactants, the Ni2SbTe2 and NiTe2 compounds are identified as ideal TEbMs for (Bi,Sb)2Te3 and Bi2(Te,Se)3, respectively, leading to interfaces with high thermal stability, low contact resistivity, and high strength. The fabricated thermoelectric generator achieves a competitive conversion efficiency of 7.1% and a power density of 0.49 W cm&#8722;2 at hot&#8208;side and cold&#8208;side temperatures of 523 and 296 K, respectively. Moreover, performance degradation is negligible after 200&#160;h of cycling. This work demonstrates progress toward stable high&#8208;performance service, provides the foundation for applications in low&#8208;grade heat recovery, and offers new insights for more thermoelectric generators.

         <title>Decoupling Lithium Reutilization Behavior under Different Discharge Rates for Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work uncovers the Li0 reutilization behavior of AFLMBs at different discharge rates, which exhibits a &#8220;volcano&#8208;type&#8221; variation. The opposite effects of the distribution relationship between fresh Li and residue Li0 and concentration polarization at specific discharge rate dominate Li0 reutilization. This cognition provides guidance toward high&#8208;power density AFLMBs under practical conditions.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium metal battery (AFLMB) has become an excellent candidate for long endurance electric vehicles and electric low altitude aircraft, profiting from its high energy density as well as outstanding manufacturing safety. However, the limitation at high discharge rates of AFLMBs is shrouded in mystery, yet to achieve more attention. Herein, the limitation of fast discharge for AFLMBs is dissected exhaustively, and a symptomatic strategy to break the limit is put forward, in order to eliminate the inevitable mismatch that lies in the inferior performance of AFLMBs. A &#8220;volcano&#8208;type&#8221; curve of capacity retention of AFLMBs is discovered with the discharge rate increased. Systematic investigation revealed that the overlapped spatial relationship between fresh deposited Li and residue Li0 facilitated the utilization of &#8220;recoverable Li0&#8221; (Li0) at the prophase of discharge rate increase. However, further enhanced discharge rate induced large concentration polarization (&#951;conc), reflecting limited Li+ diffusion. Enabling the electrolyte to rapidly transport Li+ by lowering &#951;conc increased the optimal discharge rate as well as the cycling stability of AFLMBs. This work reveals the rate&#8208;determining step for high&#8208;rate discharge and expands the employment boundary of AFLMBs under harsh conditions, providing a significant complement of present knowledge with respect to the power performance of AFLMBs.

Investigation of charge carrier dynamics in graphene/ MoS2 heterostructures under photoexcitation, revealing associated intraband THz responses. The study highlights charge transfer mechanisms and carrier lifetimes, advancing the understanding of light&#8208;matter interactions in 2D materials for optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
The engineering of terahertz phonons is challenging due to difficulties in achieving sub&#8208;nanometer material precision and in facilitating efficient phonon coupling at terahertz frequencies region. The effective generation, detection, and manipulation of terahertz phonons via the integration of atomically thin layers in van der Waals heterostructures can enable new designs for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic quantum devices, offering new avenues for thermal engineering in the terahertz regime. Here, optical pump terahertz probe and terahertz time&#8208;domain experiments are used to reveal the behavior of charge carrier transfer in real time at heterostructure interfaces of single&#8208;layer graphene and monolayer MoS2 upon photoexcitation and plausible mechanism has been put forward. Moreover, a temperature&#8208;dependent terahertz response of GM heterostructure along with experimental observation is explored in detail with considered appropriate theoretical models. These insights can prove valuable for designing the next generation of optoelectronic applications with stacked 2D heterostructures within the terahertz bandwidth.

         <title>Photogenetic&#8208;Like Liposomes Disrupt Neuroligin&#8208;3 Dependency to Enhance Glioma Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a light&#8208;responsive liposome Lip&#8208;CuRA that synergizes photothermal therapy (CuS/980&#160;nm) with dual NLGN3 regulation: RuBi&#8208;GABA/UCNPs suppress NLGN3 synthesis via Cl&#8315; channels, while GI254023X inhibits ADAM10&#8208;mediated release. In glioma models, this strategy blocks PI3K/Wnt pathways, reduces stemness, and prolongs survival through combined neuromodulation&#8208;photothermal effects.








Abstract
Neuronal activity is shown to potentiate glioma initiation, progression, and/or metastasis. A key mechanism in neural regulation of brain cancer involves the activity&#8208;dependent cleavage and release of the synaptic adhesion molecule neuroligin&#8208;3 (NLGN3). Here, this report describes the preparation of optogenetics&#8208;like liposome Lip&#8208;CuRA, which is used to regulate the content of NLGN3 in neurons and mediate phototherapy in cancer cells. Lip&#8208;CuRA contains upconversion nanoparticles encapsulating CuS (CuS@PUCNPs), a visible light&#8208;activated neurotransmitter prodrug RuBi&#8208;GABA, and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM10) inhibitors GI254023X. Upon 980&#160;nm laser irradiation, the photothermal conversion of CuS not only induces tumor cell apoptosis, but also destroys liposome structure, releasing Rubi&#8208;GABA and GI254023X. The UCNPs convert the 980&#160;nm laser into 540&#160;nm, activating RuBi&#8208;GABA into GABA. GABA selectively opens Cl&#8315; channels in nerve cells, reducing the expression of NLGN3 and the degree of axonal connections. GI254023X inhibits the activity of the ADAM10 enzyme on the nerve surface, reducing the release of NLGN3, thereby blocking the transmission of proliferation and stemness signals. In the GL261&#8208;luc orthotopic glioma model, C6&#8208;luc orthotopic glioma model, and glioma patient&#8208;derived xenograft (PDX) model, Lip&#8208;CuRA effectively inhibits tumor recurrence, reduces glioma stemness, and extends survival through a synergistic photothermal and NLGN3&#8208;regulating therapy.

         <title>Plasmon&#8208;Mediated Nanocathode for Synchronized Generation of Picosecond Pulsed Electron Beam and Electromagnetic Radiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative plasmon&#8208;mediated electron emission (PMEE) nanocathode is developed through gold nanoparticle&#8208;decorated vertically aligned few&#8208;layer graphene, enabling synchronized generation of picosecond electron pulses and GHz electromagnetic radiation. This room&#8208;temperature system achieves exceptional performance of 8.81 &#215; 109 A&#183;m&#8722;2&#183;sr&#8722;1&#183;V&#8722;1 brightness and 0.97 eV energy spread, while operating at moderate excitation, offering a promising platform for compact and high&#8208;efficiency vacuum electronic devices.









Abstract
Vacuum electronic devices offer superior electron mobility and spatiotemporal electron manipulating precision, with recent challenges focusing on ultrafast electron pulses for high&#8208;frequency, high&#8208;energy, and high&#8208;resolution applications. Plasmon&#8208;mediated electron emission (PMEE) nanocathodes provide a promising solution by producing high&#8208;quality ultrafast electron pulses while simplifying the electron beam manipulation. In this study, we developed a PMEE Au&#8208;on&#8208;Gr nanocathode using vertically aligned few&#8208;layer graphene decorated with gold nanoparticles, enabling synchronized generation of picosecond pulsed electron beam and electromagnetic radiation. The nanocathode achieved 80 MHz electron pulses with a 500 ps pulsewidth, 0.91 A&#183;cm&#8722;2 peak current density, 6.53% external quantum efficiency, and 8.81 &#215; 109 A&#183;m&#8722;2&#183;sr&#8722;1&#183;V&#8722;1 reduced brightness. Additionally, it exhibited a 7.1&#176; divergence angle and 0.97 eV energy spread under low excitations. Synchronized radiation pulses at 2.3, 5.7, and 9.2 GHz corresponded to electron pulse features. The excellent performance stems from plasmonic field enhancement and efficient hot electron generation driven by localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in the PMEE nanocathode. The dynamic effects of high&#8208;energy hot electron injection at the Au&#8208;Gr interface also play a critical role. This system enables compact, room&#8208;temperature, low&#8208;power vacuum electronic devices for ultra&#8208;high spatiotemporal resolution and high&#8208;frequency applications, driving progress in materials science and nanotechnology.

         <title>Constructing Controlled Vertical Gradient Morphology in Pseudo&#8208;Planar Heterojunction Organic Photovoltaics via Self&#8208;Assembled Interface Orthogonal Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled interface orthogonal strategy is first applied to construct pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction organic photovoltaics with controllable vertical gradient distribution morphology. Introducing low surface&#8208;energy N2200 to self&#8208;assemble molecular layer on PM6 surface overcomes erosion effect and modulates phase morphology, thus achieving the highest efficiency of 19.86% via air&#8208;printing process.








Abstract
Precisely regulating vertically distributed morphology by blade&#8208;coating process is crucial to realize high&#8208;performance large&#8208;scale pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction organic photovoltaics (OPVs). However, the thermodynamic motion and random diffusion of donor/acceptor (D/A) generated from the differences in surface energy and concentration during sequentially blade&#8208;coating process will cause great challenges for obtaining ideal active layer morphology. Herein, this study have proposed a self&#8208;assembled interface orthogonal strategy by introducing low surface energy guest (N2200) to form protective layer on PM6 surface, which counteracts erosion from orthogonal solution of acceptor to enhance continuity of D/A phases, thus promoting directional carrier migration and effectively suppressing energetic disorder. Finally, N2200&#8208;modified device achieves the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.86%, and large&#8208;area module (16.94 cm2) exhibits exceptional PCE (16.43%). This investigation presents innovative insights into morphology issue triggered by molecular motion and provides an effective method for air&#8208;printing large&#8208;scale OPVs with precisely controlled morphology based on non&#8208;halogenated solvent.

         <title>Thermodynamically&#8208;Driven Phase Engineering and Reconstruction Deduction of Medium&#8208;Entropy Prussian Blue Analogue Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine learning framework is harnessed to scrutinize the thermodynamically induced crystal phase transition behavior of medium&#8208;entropy Prussian blue analogs (ME&#8208;PBA). This study provides a unified framework for understanding the crystal phase transformation in ME&#8208;PBA and is poised to lay the groundwork for the development of other polymetallic coordination polymer derivatives.









Abstract
Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are exemplary precursors for the synthesis of a diverse array of derivatives.Yet, the intricate mechanisms underlying phase transitions in these multifaceted frameworks remain a formidable challenge. In this study, a machine learning&#8208;guided analysis of phase transitions in a medium&#8208;entropy PBA system is delineated, utilizing an array of descriptors that encompass crystallographic phases, structural subtleties, and fluctuations in multimetal valence states. By integrating multimodal simulations with experimental validation, a thermodynamics&#8208;driven phase transformation model for medium&#8208;entropy PBA is established and accurately predicted the critical synthesis parameters. A constellation of advanced techniques&#8212;including atomic force microscopy coupled with Kelvin probe force microscopy for individual nanoparticles, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, operando ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectroscopy, in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, theoretical calculations, and multiphysics simulations&#8212;substantiated that the iron oxide@NiCoZnFe&#8208;PBA exhibits both exceptional stability and remarkable electrochemical activity. This investigation provides profound insights into the phase transition dynamics of polymetallic complexes and propels the rational design of other thermally&#8208;induced derivatives.

         <title>Polymer&#8208;Halogen Pockets Steering *CO Adsorption Configurations for Highly Selective CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design and synthesis of copper nanoparticles encaged in polymer&#8208;halogen pockets for selective CO2 reduction are presented. As a direct outcome, the strategy achieves selective conversion of ethylene and ethanol, &#8776;48.3 &#177; 1.3% selectivity for ethanol, and 60.3 &#177; 2.1% for ethylene.








Abstract
The selective CO2 electroreduction (CO2R) toward specific C2 products represents a critical challenge for practical applicability, requiring precise control over *CO intermediates. Herein, a &#8220;polymer&#8208;halogen&#8221; pocketed Cu catalyst is proposed, wherein the adjustable concentration of Iodide ion (I&#8722;) within the pocket enables continuous modulation of *CO adsorption configurations on the Cu, thereby enabling tailored CO2R toward ethylene or ethanol production. A perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA)&#8208;modified CuI catalyst is constructed, where I&#8722; is in situ leaching from CuI and subsequently confined by PFSA as an anion shielding layer to form polymer&#8208;halogen pockets. By tuning the thickness of PFSA shell, the amount of I&#8722; in the pocket can be controlled. The surface&#8208;enhanced in situ Raman spectroscopy demonstrates that the coverage of *CO intermediates on Cu surface increases and tends to adsorb at low coordination Cu sites in catalyst granule for dimerization reaction as the I&#8722; concentration in the pocket increases. Furthermore, the coordination environment exhibits distinct product selectivity. *CO at medium&#8208;coordinated sites favor ethanol production, while those at low&#8208;coordinated sites are conducive to ethylene formation. This strategy enables wide modulation of ethylene&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol ratios from 0.65 to 3.96, achieving peak Faradaic efficiencies (FE) of 60.3 &#177;&#160;2.1% for ethylene and 48.3 &#177;&#160;1.3% for ethanol.

         <title>Growth Control of InP/ZnSe Heterostructured Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The morphology of ZnSe epilayers on InP NCs is controlled, ranging from tetrapod to spherical InP/ZnSe heterostructured NCs, under the guidance of DFT calculations. The expanded morphology envelope permits InP/ZnSe heterostructured NCs to customize their photophysical characteristics from stable and pure emission to environment&#8208;sensitive ones, which will prompt their practical use in a range of photonic applications.








Abstract
The morphology of heterostructured semiconductor nanocrystals (h&#8208;NCs) dictates the spatial distribution of charge carriers and their recombination dynamics and/or transport, which are the main performance indicators of photonic applications utilizing h&#8208;NCs. The inability to control the morphology of heterovalent III&#8208;V/II&#8208;VI h&#8208;NCs composed of heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free elements hinders their practical use. As a case study of III&#8208;V/II&#8208;VI h&#8208;NCs, the growth control of ZnSe epilayers on InP NCs is demonstrated here. The anisotropic morphology in InP/ZnSe h&#8208;NCs is attributed to the facet&#8208;dependent energy costs for the growth of ZnSe epilayers on different facets of InP NCs, and effective chemical means for controlling the growth rates of ZnSe on different surface planes are demonstrated. Ultimately, this article capitalizes on the controlled morphology of InP/ZnSe h&#8208;NCs to expand their photophysical characteristics from stable and pure emission to environment&#8208;sensitive one, which will facilitate their use in a variety of photonic applications.

         <title>Information Density Enhancement Using Lossy Compression in DNA Data Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Explored deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) lossy compression models to increase the information density in DNA storage. This study compared these models with others, showing potential competitive advantages, in terms of information density and image quality. This study also examined model applications using convolutional neural networks for image quality assessment, highlighting the potential of DNA storage technology for handling complex data.








Abstract
This study develops two deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)&#160;lossy compression models, Models A and B, to encode grayscale images into DNA sequences, enhance information density, and enable high&#8208;fidelity image recovery. These models, distinguished by their handling of pixel domains and interpolation methods, offer a novel approach to data storage for DNA. Model A processes pixels in overlapped domains using linear interpolation (LI), whereas Model B uses non&#8208;overlapped domains with nearest&#8208;neighbor interpolation (NNI). Through a comparative analysis with Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG)&#160;compression, the DNA lossy compression models demonstrate competitive advantages in terms of information density and image quality restoration. The application of these models to the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset reveals their efficiency and the recognizability of decompressed images, which is validated by convolutional neural network (CNN) performance. In particular, Model B2, a version of Model B, emerges as an effective method for balancing high information density (surpassing over 20 times the typical densities of two bits per nucleotide) with reasonably good image quality. These findings highlight the potential of DNA&#8208;based data storage systems for high&#8208;density and efficient compression, indicating a promising future for biological data storage solutions.

         <title>Rapid Surface Reconstruction of In2S3 Photoanode via Flame Treatment for Enhanced Photoelectrochemical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid surface reconstruction strategy is proposed to enhance the charge collection efficiency and stability of indium sulfide (In2S3) photoanode via a high&#8208;temperature flame treatment. This method selectively transforms the In2S3 surface into a diffusionless In2O3 and generates bulk sulfur vacancies, resulting in surface&#8208;reconstructed In2S3 (sr&#8208;In2S3). The sr&#8208;In2S3 exhibits an impressive photocurrent density of 8.5 mA cm&#8722;2, outperforming previously reported sulfide&#8208;based photoanodes.








Abstract
Surface reconstruction, reorganizing the surface atoms or structure, is a promising strategy to manipulate materials' electrical, electrochemical, and surface catalytic properties. Herein, a rapid surface reconstruction of indium sulfide (In2S3) is demonstrated via a high&#8208;temperature flame treatment to improve its charge collection properties. The flame process selectively transforms the In2S3 surface into a diffusionless In2O3 layer with high crystallinity. Additionally, it controllably generates bulk sulfur vacancies within a few seconds, leading to surface&#8208;reconstructed In2S3 (sr&#8208;In2S3). When using those sr&#8208;In2S3 as photoanode for photoelectrochemical water splitting devices, these dual functions of surface In2O3/bulk In2S3 reduce the charge recombination in the surface and bulk region, thus improving photocurrent density and stability. With optimized surface reconstruction, the sr&#8208;In2S3 photoanode demonstrates a significant photocurrent density of 8.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#160;V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), marking a 2.5&#8208;fold increase compared to pristine In2S3 (3.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). More importantly, the sr&#8208;In2S3 photoanode exhibits an impressive photocurrent density of 7.3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 0.6&#160;V versus RHE for iodide oxidation reaction. A practical and scalable surface reconstruction is also showcased via flame treatment. This work provides new insights for surface reconstruction engineering in sulfide&#8208;based semiconductors, making a breakthrough in developing efficient solar&#8208;fuel energy devices.

         <title>Ferroelectric Stochasticity in 2D CuInP2S6 and Its Application for True Random Number Generator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a true random number generator (TRNG) based on stochastic ferroelectric polarization switching in 2D CuInP2S6 materials, is reported. The TRNG exhibits exceptional stochastic variability, surpassing conventional entropy metrics, and passes the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) randomness tests. Moreover, TRNG's unclonability is demonstrated through device&#8208;to&#8208;device variation, providing resilience against machine learning (ML) attacks.








Abstract
True random number generators (TRNGs), which create cryptographically secure random bitstreams, hold great promise in addressing security concerns regarding hardware, communication, and authentication in the Internet of Things (IoT) realm. Recently, TRNGs based on nanoscale materials have gained considerable attention for avoiding conventional and predictable hardware circuitry designs that can be vulnerable to machine learning (ML) attacks. In this article, a low&#8208;power and low&#8208;cost TRNG developed by exploiting stochastic ferroelectric polarization switching in 2D ferroelectric CuInP2S6 (CIPS)&#8208;based capacitive structures, is reported. The stochasticity arises from the probabilistic switching of independent electrical dipoles. The TRNG exhibits enhanced stochastic variability with near&#8208;ideal entropy, uniformity, uniqueness, Hamming distance, and independence from autocorrelation variations. Its unclonability is systematically examined using device&#8208;to&#8208;device variations. The generated cryptographic bitstreams pass the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) randomness tests. This nanoscale CIPS&#8208;based TRNG is circuit&#8208;integrable and exhibits potential for hardware security in edge devices with advanced data encryption.

2D spiking neural network consisting of 2D ferroelectric FET synapses and 2D impact ionization FET spiking neurons are demonstrated. This study marks a major leap in developing fast&#8208;switching, energy&#8208;efficient ultra&#8208;low&#8208;power devices vital for future artificial neural networks, addressing key challenges in energy management for spiking neuron devices.








Abstract
The integration of artificial spiking neurons based on steep&#8208;switching logic devices and artificial synapses with neuromorphic functions enables an energy&#8208;efficient computer architecture that mimics the human brain well, known as a spiking neural network (SNN). 2D materials with impact ionization or ferroelectric characteristics have the potential for use in such devices. However, research on 2D spiking neurons remains limited and investigations of 2D artificial synapses far more common. An innovative 2D spiking neuron is implemented using a WSe2 impact ionization transistor (I2FET), while a spiking neural network is formed by combining it with a 2D ferroelectric synaptic device (FeFET). The suggested 2D spiking neuron demonstrates precise spiking behavior that closely resembles that of actual neurons. In addition, it achieves a low energy consumption of 2&#160;pJ/spike. The better impact ionization properties of WSe2 are responsible for this efficiency. Furthermore, an all&#8208;2D SNN consisting of 2D I2FET neurons and 2D FeFET synapses is constructed, which achieves high accuracy of 87.5% in a face classification task by unsupervised learning. The integration of a 2D SNN with 2D steep&#8208;switching spiking neuronal devices and 2D synaptic devices shows great potential for the development of neuromorphic systems with improved energy efficiency and computational capabilities.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel percolative metal microweb&#8208;based flexible electrode using electrohydrodynamic processes is developed. This lightweight and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) electrode enhances the electrochemical and mechanical performances of the resultant lithium&#8208;ion batteries with improved energy density, lithium&#8208;ion diffusion, and electron transfer.

Abstract
Flexible and high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) encounter challenges due to the inherent trade&#8208;offs in conventional electrode designs, particularly concerning mechanical flexibility and high energy density. Here, a novel percolative metal microweb&#8208;based electrode, fabricated via electrohydrodynamic processes, yielding a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) network structure with exceptional electrical properties and mechanical durability is introduced. This lightweight electrode design addresses the need for improved energy density by reducing the weight of the current collector, which typically accounts for more than 10% of the battery's weight. The 3D architecture of the electrode enhances the contact area with the electrolyte, thereby minimizing polarization voltage and improving lithium&#8208;ion diffusion.

&lt;p&gt;Flexible and high-performance lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) encounter challenges due to the inherent trade-offs in conventional electrode designs, particularly concerning mechanical flexibility and high energy density. Here, a novel percolative metal microweb-based electrode, fabricated via electrohydrodynamic processes, yielding a three-dimensional (3D) network structure with exceptional electrical properties and mechanical durability is introduced. This lightweight electrode design addresses the need for improved energy density by reducing the weight of the current collector, which typically accounts for more than 10% of the battery's weight. The 3D architecture of the electrode enhances the contact area with the electrolyte, thereby minimizing polarization voltage and improving lithium-ion diffusion.

The proposed &#181;LED pixel circuit utilizes IGZO/Te CFETs, which exhibits symmetrical ambipolar behavior. The IGZO/Te heterostructure is confirmed to consist of an amorphous IGZO layer and a hexagonal Te layer using HR&#8208;TEM and GIXRD. The circuit, based on PWM, achieved 8&#8208;bit gray level control and stable &#181;LED luminance, confirming its suitability for high&#8208;quality &#181;LED displays.








Abstract
This study investigates a micro light&#8208;emitting diode (&#181;LED) pixel circuit using the heterogeneous integration of complementary field&#8208;effect transistors (CFETs). The CFETs are fabricated using a semiconductor layer composed of tellurium (Te) and indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc oxide (IGZO) layers. Te and IGZO layers in the heterostructure IGZO/Te film exhibit hexagonal and amorphous phases, respectively, indicating that each layer maintains independent material characteristics. The fabricated IGZO/Te CFETs exhibit ambipolar behavior with a turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.0&#160;V and field&#8208;effect mobility of 0.74 and 1.42 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type channels, respectively. Inverters comprising IGZO/Te CFET and IGZO TFT exhibit inverting behavior. A &#181;LED pixel circuit is designed using IGZO/Te CFETs based on pulse width modulation (PWM). The proposed circuit uses an inverter structure with IGZO/Te and IGZO to control the emission time, suppressing the wavelength shift of &#181;LEDs depending on the &#181;LED current levels. The operation of the proposed pixel circuit is investigated through simulation and measurement of the fabricated circuit. The fabricated &#181;LED pixel circuit successfully exhibits PWM operation, controlling the emission time and luminance. Consequently, IGZO/Te CFETs show promise as devices for high&#8208;quality &#181;LED displays.

         <title>Electron Release via Internal Polarization Fields for Optimal S&#8208;H Bonding States</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study offers insights into material design rules for activating the basal planes of TMDs and suggests ultimate strategies using positively charged built&#8208;in polarized fields that electrostatically repel H2S+ ions. The de&#8208;localizing charge density derived from the released electrons originally bound to S atoms at the Sv incorporated heterointerface, results in unidirectional charge transport to the basal plane.








Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have received considerable attention as promising electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), yet their potential is often constrained by the inertness of the basal planes arising from their poor hydrogen adsorption ability. Here, the relationship between the electronic structure of the WS2 basal plane and HER activity is systemically analyzed to establish a clear insight. The valance state of the sulfur atoms on the basal plane has been tuned to enhance hydrogen adsorption through sequential engineering processes, including direct phase transition and heterostructure that induces work function&#8208;difference&#8208;induced unidirectional electron transfer. Additionally, an innovative synthetic approach, harnessing the built&#8208;in internal polarization field at the W&#8208;graphene heterointerface, triggers the in&#8208;situ formation of sulfur vacancies in the bottom WSx (x &lt; 2) layers. The resultant modulation of the valance state of the sulfur atom stabilizes the W&#8208;S bond, while destabilizing the S&#8208;H bond. The electronic structural changes are further amplified by the release and transfer of surplus electrons via sulfur vacancies, filling the valance state of W and S atoms. Consequently, this work provides a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between the electronic structure of the WS2 basal plane and the HER activity, focusing on optimizing S&#8208;H bonding state.

         <title>High Thermal Conductive Crystalline Organohalide for Endurable Resistive Switching Non&#8208;Volatile Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Typical organic materials&#8208;based resistive memory devices suffer from poor operational reliability and stability. The crystalline organohalide&#8208;based thin film with high thermal conductivity and low electrical conductivity introduced in this study enabled a reliable resistive memory device with significantly enhanced endurance, high on/off ratio, and millivolt scale operating voltages.








Abstract
The organic&#8208;based memristive devices are widely studied as a next&#8208;generation electronics for eco&#8208;friendly wearable applications, thanks to materials` flexibility and biocompatibility. However, poor operational reliability and stability of the devices remain a critical challenge. Here, the study demonstrates a crystalline organohalide, Dabconium ammonium triiodide (DABCO&#8208;NH4&#8208;I3, DABCO is 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2] octonium)&#8208;based memristive device with exceptionally high reliability and endurance. Owing to the low dielectric constant and anisotropic hexagonal crystal structure consisting of hydrogen bonds with a high bandgap, the DABCO&#8208;NH4&#8208;I3&#8208;based conductive bridging random access memory device demonstrates millivolt&#8208;scale operating voltages with a remarkably high on/off ratio of &#8776;109, capable of multi&#8208;level storage. The relatively higher thermal conductivity of the crystalline organohalide (1.06&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1K&#8722;1), compared to most of organic materials (0.1&#8211;0.5&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1K&#8722;1), is found to be beneficial to suppress intense heat accumulation generated by Joule heating effect during device operation. With the facilitated dissipation of the generated heat, the simple planar heterojunction structured device shows remarkably endurable resistive switching over 103 cycles of program&#8208;erase at both room temperature and 85 &#176;C with high switching reliability. This study introduced a new class of materials that can overcome the limitations of existing organic materials for high&#8208;performance next&#8208;generation organic electronic devices.

         <title>Spectroscopic Signatures of Ultra&#8208;Thin Amorphous Carbon with the Tuned Disorder Directly Grown on a Dielectric Substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a method for directly growing ultra&#8208;thin amorphous carbon with controlled levels of disorder on dielectric substrates, eliminating issues related to material transfer. Using XPS, EELS, and Raman spectroscopy for material characterization, the films exhibit distinct signatures, with Raman spectroscopy especially effective in identifying disorder levels. Additionally, electrical and dielectric measurements indicate promising potential for nanometer&#8208;scale semiconductor applications.








Abstract
The reduced structural complexity of atomically thin amorphous carbons makes it suitable for semiconductor technology. Inherent challenges arise from transfer processes subsequent to growth on metallic substrates, posing significant challenges to the accurate characterization of amorphous materials, thereby compromising the reliability of spectroscopic analysis. Here this work presents a novel approach: direct growth of ultra&#8208;thin amorphous carbon with tuned disorder on a dielectric substrate (SiO2/Si) using photochemical reaction and thermal annealing process with a solid precursor. This work characterizes the amorphous carbon films' disorder using spectroscopic techniques, such as X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Electron energy loss spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy, which offer greater convenience compared to microscopy&#8208;based studies. This method, rooted in comprehensive spectroscopic characterization, elucidates characteristic signatures inherent to the amorphous carbon films. These findings reveal that Raman spectroscopy is particularly effective in identifying the amorphous phase of atomically&#8208;thin carbon. Additionally, I&#8208;V characterization and high&#8208;frequency dielectric measurements showcase the potential application of directly grown amorphous carbon films in the semiconductor industry, where nanometer&#8208;level thin conductors and dielectrics are commonly utilized.

     alt="Spectroscopic Signatures of Ultra-Thin Amorphous Carbon with the Tuned Disorder Directly Grown on a Dielectric Substrate"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study introduces a method for directly growing ultra-thin amorphous carbon with controlled levels of disorder on dielectric substrates, eliminating issues related to material transfer. Using XPS, EELS, and Raman spectroscopy for material characterization, the films exhibit distinct signatures, with Raman spectroscopy especially effective in identifying disorder levels. Additionally, electrical and dielectric measurements indicate promising potential for nanometer-scale semiconductor applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reduced structural complexity of atomically thin amorphous carbons makes it suitable for semiconductor technology. Inherent challenges arise from transfer processes subsequent to growth on metallic substrates, posing significant challenges to the accurate characterization of amorphous materials, thereby compromising the reliability of spectroscopic analysis. Here this work presents a novel approach: direct growth of ultra-thin amorphous carbon with tuned disorder on a dielectric substrate (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Si) using photochemical reaction and thermal annealing process with a solid precursor. This work characterizes the amorphous carbon films' disorder using spectroscopic techniques, such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Electron energy loss spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy, which offer greater convenience compared to microscopy-based studies. This method, rooted in comprehensive spectroscopic characterization, elucidates characteristic signatures inherent to the amorphous carbon films. These findings reveal that Raman spectroscopy is particularly effective in identifying the amorphous phase of atomically-thin carbon. Additionally, I-V characterization and high-frequency dielectric measurements showcase the potential application of directly grown amorphous carbon films in the semiconductor industry, where nanometer-level thin conductors and dielectrics are commonly utilized. This transfer-free characterization method provides a useful tool to find the correlation between atomic structure and electrical/optical properties, giving valuable insights into comprehensive crystallographic fundamental research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Titanium&#8210;Nickel Dual Active Sites Enabled Reversible Hydrogen Storage of Magnesium at 180&#160;&#176;C with Exceptional Cycle Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, the Mg2Ni@Ti&#9472;MgO catalyst, featuring Mg2Ni and stable Ti&#9472;MgO with stable Ti valence state, is applied to Mg/MgH2. It simultaneously facilitates the hydrogen adsorption, dissociation, diffusion, and nucleation processes, enabling moderate&#8208;temperature hydrogen storage reactions with long&#8208;term cycle stability. These findings suggest the importance of combining early&#8208; and late&#8208;transition metals in a gas&#8208;solid phase reaction.








Abstract
Enhancing hydrogenation and dehydrogenation (de/hydrogenation) kinetics without compromising cycle stability is a major challenge for Mg&#8208;based hydrogen storage materials (Mg/MgH2). The de/hydrogenation reactions of Mg/MgH2 are one of the gas&#8211;solid reactions involving hydrogen adsorption, dissociation, diffusion, and nucleation, which often results in the catalysts being unable to simultaneously accelerate these distinct kinetic processes. Here, the Mg2Ni@Ti&#9472;MgO catalyst with dual active sites is reported to be designed to address this issue. The stabilization of Ti2+ and Ti3+ valence states in the MgO lattice simultaneously accelerates hydrogen adsorption and dissociation. Additionally, Mg2Ni serves as a hydrogen diffusion and nucleation center, synergistically enhancing de/hydrogenation reactions. Consequently, it enables MgH2 to release 5.28&#160;wt.% H2 in 2&#160;min at 280&#160;&#176;C, and achieves 1.96&#160;wt.% H2 of hydrogen release in 60&#160;min at 180&#160;&#176;C. The Mg2Ni@Ti&#9472;MgO catalyst exhibits remarkable chemical stability at the interfacial structure, minimizing structural and chemical degradation impact, and realizing excellent de/hydrogenation performance over 1000 cycles. These results provide a new methodology for optimizing multiple kinetic steps, attaining highly efficient and stable de/hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Decoding the Role of Molecular Orientation in Conjugated Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers for High&#8208;Performance Binary Organic Photovoltaics Approaching 20% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study elucidates how the molecular orientation of conjugated self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) governs work function (WF) modulation via alignment of the conjugated core with the surface normal. Edge&#8208;on&#8208;oriented BCZ&#8208;1 molecule maximizes vertical dipole moments and achieves dense in&#8208;plane coverage, enabling ultrafast hole extraction and minimized recombination. The resultant binary organic photovoltaics achieve a record efficiency of 19.93%, highlighting orientation engineering as a pivotal strategy for high&#8208;performance devices.








Abstract
Molecular orientation stands as the quintessential hallmark of conjugated self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs), which have recently catalyzed noteworthy advancements in organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Nevertheless, an unambiguous understanding of these directional arrangements and their impact on optoelectronic properties remains elusive. To address this issue, herein three SAMs with representative orientations, i.e., edge&#8208;on (BCZ&#8208;1), tilt&#8208;on (4PACz) and face&#8208;on (BCZ&#8208;2) are meticulously designed. These orientations have been rigorously validated by sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy and first&#8208;principles calculations. Remarkably, an unequivocal correlation between the molecular orientation and the device performance is discerned. Particularly, the edge&#8208;on oriented BCZ&#8208;1 exhibits the largest dipole moment normal to the electrode, accompanied by a dense and uniform coverage. These features collectively contribute to its strongest work function increment for ultra&#8208;fast hole extraction and minimum interfacial carrier recombination. As a result, a champion power conversion efficiency of 19.93% is achieved in devices based on BCZ&#8208;1 with D18:L8&#8208;BO as the active layer, representing one of the highest values reported for binary bulk heterojunction OPVs. Besides, BCZ&#8208;1 shows great potential for practical applications due to its superior up&#8208;scalability and enhanced device shelf&#8208;stability. Overall, this work offers in&#8208;depth insights into the orientation behaviors of SAMs, opening new avenues to unlock the efficiency potential of OPVs.

         <title>Imaging the 4D Chemical Heterogeneity of Single V2O5 Particles During Charging/Discharging Processes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spectrally&#8208;resolved dual&#8208;mode spinning&#8208;disk confocal microscopy is developed to monitor the 4D chemical heterogeneity of single V2O5 particles during cycling. A unique and irreversible transformation of V5+ to V3+ on a particle's bottom electric contact points has been unveiled for the first time. The coordination strategy between ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid and V3+ is proposed to inhibit V3+ precipitation effectively.








Abstract
Microparticle cathode materials are widely used in secondary batteries. However, obtaining dynamic chemical heterogeneities of these microparticles is challenging, hindering in&#8208;depth mechanistic investigation of the underlying processes. For example, although vanadium pentoxide shows promise as an electrode material for zinc ion batteries, its poor performance's root cause is elusive. Herein, a fluorescence/scattering dual&#8208;mode spinning disk confocal microscopy&#8208;based approach is developed to visualize the 4D chemical heterogeneity of single V2O5 particles during cycling. Dual&#8208;mode in situ imaging identifies valence state changes of vanadium ions with high spatiotemporal resolution. A unique difference is observed between the scattering intensities of a particle's bottom electric contact points and the rest parts during the discharging process. In contrast, fluorescence intensity variation suggests high consistency across the particles. Correlative Raman, UV&#8211;Vis spectroscopy, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analyses suggest the precipitation of V3+ species at the bottom interface of the V2O5 electrode, leading to increased electron transfer resistance and compromised overall performance. A coordination strategy between ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid and V3+ is proposed for inhibiting V3+ precipitation, and its effectiveness is further verified by imaging and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analyses. Insights from the imaging approach presented herein will enable the rational design of high&#8208;performance batteries.

         <title>Proposing Altermagnetic&#8208;Ferroelectric Type&#8208;III Multiferroics with Robust Magnetoelectric Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiferroics are highly sought after for advanced technological applications. Here, a novel class of type&#8208;III multiferroics is proposed, where ferroelectricity and altermagnetism are inherently interlocked by crystal symmetry, setting them apart from conventional multiferroics. The ferroelectric switching is shown to fully invert the spin polarization of altermagnets, equivalent to a 180&#176; reversal of magnetic spin.








Abstract
Multiferroic materials, characterized by the coexisting of ferroelectric polarization (breaking space&#8208; inversion symmetry, &#119979;) and magnetism (breaking time&#8208;reversal symmetry, &#119983;), with strong magnetoelectric coupling, are highly sought after for advanced technological applications. Novel altermagnets, distinct from conventional magnets, have recently been revealed to exhibit unique spin polarization protected by crystal symmetry, which naturally overcomes the isolation of magnetism from ferroelectrics associated with spatial symmetry. In this study, a novel class of type&#8208;III multiferroics is proposed, which leverages the unique symmetry of altermagnets to enforce spin&#8208;ferroelectric locking, setting them apart from conventional multiferroics. Through first&#8208;principles calculations, ferroelectric switching is shown to fully invert the spin polarization of altermagnets, equivalent to a 180&#176; reversal of magnetic spin. This altermagnetic phase controlled by ferroelectrics can be effectively probed using the magneto&#8208;optical Kerr effect, revealing a new class of multiferroics with intrinsic and deterministic magnetoelectric coupling. This theoretical advancement redefines the design principles of magnetoelectric materials and lays the foundation for the design of next&#8208;generation spintronic devices leveraging altermagnetism.

The ferroelectric switching is shown to fully invert the spin polarization of altermagnets, equivalent to a 180&#176; reversal of magnetic spin.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiferroic materials, characterized by the coexisting of ferroelectric polarization (breaking space- inversion symmetry, &#119979;) and magnetism (breaking time-reversal symmetry, &#119983;), with strong magnetoelectric coupling, are highly sought after for advanced technological applications. Novel altermagnets, distinct from conventional magnets, have recently been revealed to exhibit unique spin polarization protected by crystal symmetry, which naturally overcomes the isolation of magnetism from ferroelectrics associated with spatial symmetry. In this study, a novel class of type-III multiferroics is proposed, which leverages the unique symmetry of altermagnets to enforce spin-ferroelectric locking, setting them apart from conventional multiferroics. Through first-principles calculations, ferroelectric switching is shown to fully invert the spin polarization of altermagnets, equivalent to a 180&#176; reversal of magnetic spin. This altermagnetic phase controlled by ferroelectrics can be effectively probed using the magneto-optical Kerr effect, revealing a new class of multiferroics with intrinsic and deterministic magnetoelectric coupling. This theoretical advancement redefines the design principles of magnetoelectric materials and lays the foundation for the design of next-generation spintronic devices leveraging altermagnetism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interfacial Energetics Reversal Strategy for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy&#8208; &#8220;interfacial energetics reversal&#8221; to reconstruct perovskite energetics that matches well with the upper hole transport layer has been successfully developed, enabling efficient n&#8211;i&#8211;p perovskite solar cells with nonradiative recombination induced qVoc loss of only 57 meV from the radiative limit.








Abstract
Reducing heterointerface nonradiative recombination is a key challenge for realizing highly efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Motivated by this, a facile strategy is developed via interfacial energetics reversal to functionalize perovskite heterointerface. A surfactant molecule, trichloro[3&#8208;(pentafluorophenyl)propyl]silane (TPFS) reverses perovskite surface energetics from intrinsic n&#8208;type to p&#8208;type, evidently demonstrated by ultraviolet and inverse photoelectron spectroscopies. The reconstructed perovskite surface energetics match well with the upper deposited hole transport layer, realizing an exquisite energy level alignment for accelerating hole extraction across the heterointerface. Meanwhile, TPFS further diminishes surface defect density. As a result, this cooperative strategy leads to greatly minimized nonradiative recombination. PSCs achieve an impressive power conversion efficiency of 25.9% with excellent reproducibility, and a nonradiative recombination&#8208;induced qVoc loss of only 57 meV, which is the smallest reported to date in n&#8208;i&#8208;p structured PSCs.

         <title>Key Role of Bridge Adsorbed Hydrogen Intermediate on Pt&#8211;Ru Pair for Efficient Acidic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The designed Pt atomic chain modified fcc&#8208;type Ru nanocrystal with co&#8208;crystalline structure possesses an efficient bridge adsorbed hydrogen configuration (*Hbridge) at the Pt&#8211;Ru(fcc) interface. The *Hbridge dominates HER and exhibits superior intrinsic activity, &#8776;10.6 times higher than that of Pt. The designed Pt&#8211;Ru(fcc) with *Hbridge demonstrates excellent catalytic activity and stability for both laboratory and industrial levels.








Abstract
Atop and multiple adsorbed hydrogen are considered as key intermediates on Pt&#8208;group metal for acidic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), yet the role of bridge hydrogen intermediate (*Hbridge) is consistently overlooked experimentally. Herein, a Pt atomic chain modified fcc&#8208;Ru nanocrystal (Pt&#8211;Ru(fcc)) is developed with a co&#8208;crystalline structure, featuring *Hbridge intermediate bonded on the Pt&#8211;Ru pair site. Electrons leap from the pair site to *Hbridge facilitate hydrogen desorption, thus accelerating the Tafel kinetics and ensuring outstanding electrocatalytic performance, with a low overpotential (4.0&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#8201;&#160;cm&#8722;2) and high turnover frequency (56.4&#8201;H2&#8201;s&#8722;1 at 50&#8201;mV). Notably, the proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer PEMWE with ultra&#8208;low loading of 10 ugPt&#8201;cm&#8722;2 shows excellent activity (1.61&#160;V at 1.0&#8201;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and low average degradation rate (4.0 &#181;V h&#8722;1 over 1000&#160;h), significantly outperforming the benchmark Pt/C. Furthermore, the PEMWE&#8208;based 80&#160;&#181;m Gore membrane under identical operating conditions requires only 1.54 and 1.58&#160;V to achieve 1.0 and 1.5 A cm&#8722;2. This finding highlights the key role of *Hbridge at the Pt&#8211;Ru interface in obtaining high HER intrinsic activity and underscores the transformative potential in designing next&#8208;generation bimetallic catalysts for clean hydrogen energy.

         <title>Iodine&#8208;Mediated Redox Strategy for Sustainable Lithium Extraction From Spent LiFePO4 Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iodine&#8208;mediated electrochemical strategy recycles spent LiFePO4 cathodes, extracting lithium as carbonate and producing metallic zinc. Delithiated LiFePO4 is transformed into an efficient oxygen evolution catalyst. This scalable, sustainable approach reduces energy use and emissions while offering economic benefits for clean energy applications.








Abstract
With the widespread application of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, the recycling of spent batteries, especially those involving LiFePO4 (LFP) cathodes for their low&#8208;cost and high safety, has become an urgent environmental and resource challenge. Traditional recycling methods (hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy) struggle to achieve green and efficient recycling. Herein, this study proposes an iodine&#8208;mediated electrochemical strategy to utilize a recyclable I3&#8722;/I&#8722; redox system and efficiently extract Li+ from spent LFP through liquid&#8208;phase reactions on one side (achieving a 93% leaching rate and recovery as lithium carbonate), while simultaneously producing metallic zinc through electrodeposition, which can be directly used in Zn&#8208;air batteries or hydrogen production. Furthermore, the delithiated LFP is upcycled into an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, achieving an overpotential of only 250&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, superior to commercial RuO2 catalysts. Eventually, this system reduces energy consumption by 32% (9.2&#160;MJ kg&#8722;1) compared to traditional hydrometallurgical processes, decreases greenhouse gas emissions by 35% compared to traditional pyrometallurgical processes, while achieving a net profit of &#8776;$0.44 per kg. This work establishes a novel, scalable recycling system, providing a robust sustainable solution for spent LFP cathodes recycling and clean energy storage.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible QZPCs formulated by the MES@CNT/CC air cathode and IL&#8208;PANa hydrogel electrolyte demonstrate a high cell&#8208;level energy density of 105 Wh kgcell&#8722;1, and an ultra&#8208;long cycle life of 4000 cycles at 5 mA cm&#8722;2 even at low temperature of &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C. The electronic synergy within the bifunctional MES@CNT/CC air cathode, initiates an intriguing adaptive active&#8208;site&#8208;switching catalytic mechanism during the reciprocating ORR and OER processes, thereby sustaining the high performance of the QZPCs.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;air pouch cells (QZPCs) promise a high energy&#8208;to&#8208;cost ratio while ensuring inherent safety. However, addressing the challenges associated with exploring superior energy&#8208;wise cathode catalysts along with their activity origin, and the super&#8208;ionic electrolytes remains a fundamental task. Herein, the realistic high&#8208;performance QZPCs are contrived, underpinned by a robust NiVFeCo medium&#8208;entropy metal sulfides (MESs) bifunctional air cathode with a record&#8208;low potential polarization of 0.523&#160;V, paired with a sodium polyacrylate&#8208;ionic liquid hydrogel exhibiting exceptional conductivity (234 mS cm&#8722;1) and water retention (93.8% at 7 days) at room temperature as the super&#8208;ionic conductor electrolyte. Through combined studies of in situ Raman, ex situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analysis, and theoretic calculations, an intriguing adaptive active&#8208;sites&#8208;switching mechanism of the MESs cathode during discharging/charging processes is unveiled, revealing a dynamic role transition of Co and Ni active sites in the reversible oxygen electrocatalysis. Consequently, the persistent low cathode polarization and super ion&#8208;conductive electrolyte endorse QZPCs an excellent rate performance from 1 to 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at room temperature.

&lt;p&gt;Flexible QZPCs formulated by the MES@CNT/CC air cathode and IL-PANa hydrogel electrolyte demonstrate a high cell-level energy density of 105 Wh kg&lt;sub&gt;cell&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and an ultra-long cycle life of 4000 cycles at 5 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; even at low temperature of &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C. The electronic synergy within the bifunctional MES@CNT/CC air cathode, initiates an intriguing adaptive active-site-switching catalytic mechanism during the reciprocating ORR and OER processes, thereby sustaining the high performance of the QZPCs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quasi-solid-state Zn-air pouch cells (QZPCs) promise a high energy-to-cost ratio while ensuring inherent safety. However, addressing the challenges associated with exploring superior energy-wise cathode catalysts along with their activity origin, and the super-ionic electrolytes remains a fundamental task. Herein, the realistic high-performance QZPCs are contrived, underpinned by a robust NiVFeCo medium-entropy metal sulfides (MESs) bifunctional air cathode with a record-low potential polarization of 0.523&#160;V, paired with a sodium polyacrylate-ionic liquid hydrogel exhibiting exceptional conductivity (234 mS cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and water retention (93.8% at 7 days) at room temperature as the super-ionic conductor electrolyte. Through combined studies of in situ Raman, ex situ X-ray absorption fine structure analysis, and theoretic calculations, an intriguing adaptive active-sites-switching mechanism of the MESs cathode during discharging/charging processes is unveiled, revealing a dynamic role transition of Co and Ni active sites in the reversible oxygen electrocatalysis. Consequently, the persistent low cathode polarization and super ion-conductive electrolyte endorse QZPCs an excellent rate performance from 1 to 100&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at room temperature. Moreover, an impressively high cell-level energy density of 105&#160;Wh kg&lt;sub&gt;cell&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with an ultra-long cycle lifespan of 4000 cycles at 5&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a low temperature of &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C is achieved.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Emergent Locomotion in Self&#8208;Sustained, Mechanically Connected Soft Matter Rings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally fueled, self&#8208;moving twisted rings made from liquid crystal elastomers are investigated. By studying single rings and linked knots, it is shown how autonomous locomotion emerges through coupling between the rings. The movement is programmable via handedness control at connection points, offering insights into collective behavior and programmable motion in soft materials.








Abstract
In nature, the interplay between individual organisms often leads to the emergence of complex belabours, of which sophistication has been refined through millions of years of evolution. Synthetic materials research has focused on mimicking the natural complexity, e.g., by harnessing non&#8208;equilibrium states to drive self&#8208;assembly processes. However, it is highly challenging to understand the interaction dynamics between non&#8208;equilibrium entities and to obtain collective behavior that can arise autonomously through interaction. In this study, thermally fueled, twisted rings exhibiting self&#8208;sustained movements are used as fundamental units and their interactive behaviors and emergent functions are investigated. The rings are fabricated from connected thermoresponsive liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) strips that undergo zero&#8208;elastic&#8208;energy&#8208;mode, autonomous motions upon a heat gradient. Single&#8208;ring structures with various twisting numbers and nontrivial links, and connected knots where several LCE rings (N = 2,3,4,5) are studied and linked. The observations uncover that controlled locomotion of the structures can emerge when N &#8805; 3. The locomotion can be programmed by controlling the handedness at the connection points between the individual rings. These findings illustrate how group activity emerges from individual responsive material components through mechanical coupling, offering a model for programming autonomous locomotion in soft matter constructs.
