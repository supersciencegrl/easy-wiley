         <title>Bifunctional ultrathin RhRu0.5 alloy nanowire electrocatalysts for hydrazine assisted water splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Hydrazine assisted water electrolysis offers a feasible path for low&#8208;voltage green hydrogen production. Herein w e report the design and synthesis of ultrathin RhRu0.5 alloy wavy nanowires as bifunctional electrocatalysts for both anodic hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) and cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). W e show that the RhRu0.5 alloy wavy nanowires can achieve total electrooxidation of hydrazine with lower overpotential and high mass activity as well as improved performance for HER, which together, leads to ultrahigh performance for hydrazine assisted water electrolysis, with ultralow cell voltage of 54&#160;mV at current density of 100&#160;mA/cm2 and ultrahigh current density of 853&#160;mA/cm2 at a cell voltage of 0.6&#160;V. The resulting electrocatalysts further demonstrate a stable operation at a high current density of 100&#160;mA/cm2 for 80 hours of testing period with little degradation. The overall performance not only far exceeds the performances of the previously reported hydrazine assisted water electrolyzers, but also equivalent to a high turnover frequency (TOF) value of 1618/h for catalytic hydrazine decomposition at room temperature, which outperforms many previously reported catalysts (TOF &lt; 500/h at room temperature).

         <title>Visualizing the atomic configuration of carbonate groups in a (Cu,C)Ba2Ca3Cu4O11+&#948; superconductor</title>

Abstract
Carbonates (CO32&#8722;) have always been known as impurities to degrade the superconductivity in cuprate high&#8208;Tc superconductors. Herein, the atomic arrangement of carbonates is directly visualized in (Cu,C)Ba2Ca3Cu4O11+&#948; via integrated differential phase contrast (iDPC) combined with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art scanning transmission electron microscopy. The carbon atoms replace Cu atoms in the charge&#8208;reservoir layers, contributing to the formation of carbonates through strong orbital hybridization with the surrounding oxygen atoms. Using first&#8208;principles calculations, the spatial configuration of carbonate groups is confirmed and their influence on local crystal lattice and electronic states are further investigated. The carbonates not only accommodate the distortions by improving the flatness of outer CuO2 layers but also reduce the density of states at the Fermi level. These two factors play competitive roles to affect the superconductivity. Our study provides direct evidence of the presence of CO32&#8722; groups and gains an insight into the underlying mechanism of superconductivity in oxycarbonate superconductors.

         <title>Stacking Faults Inducing Oxygen Anion Activities in Li2MnO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Controllable anionic redox for a transformational increase in the energy density is the pursuit of next generation Li&#8208;ion battery cathode materials. Its activation mechanism is coupled with the local coordination environment around O, which posts experimental challenges for control. Here w e show the tuning capability of anionic redox by varying O local environment via experimentally controlling the density of stacking faults in Li2MnO3, the parent compound of Li&#8208;rich oxides. By combining computational analysis and spectroscopic study, w e quantitatively reveal that more stacking faults can trigger smaller Li&#8208;O&#8208;Li bond angles and larger Li&#8208;O bond distance in local Li&#8208;rich environments and subsequently activate oxygen redox reactivity, which, in turn enhances the reactivity of Mn upon the following reduction process. This study highlights the critical role of local structure environment in tunning the anionic reactivity, which provides guidance in designing high&#8208;capacity layered cathodes by appropriately adjusting stacking faults.

         <title>Molecular Locking with All&#8208;Organic Surface Modifiers Enables Stable and Efficient Slot&#8208;Die Coated Methyl&#8208;Ammonium&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Modules</title>

Abstract
The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art large area slot die&#8208;coated perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is now over 19%, but issues with their stability persist owing to significant intrinsic point defects and a mass of surface imperfections introduced during fabrication process. We report the utilization of a hydrophobic all&#8208;organic salt to modify the top surface of large area slot&#8208;die coated methylammonium (MA)&#8208;free halide perovskite layers. Bearing two molecules, each of which is endowed with anchoring groups capable of exhibiting secondary interactions with the perovskite surfaces, the organic salt acts as a molecular lock by effectively binding to both anion and cation vacancies, substantially enhancing the materials&#8217; intrinsic stability against different stimuli. It not only reduces the ingression of external species such as oxygen and moisture, but also suppresses the egress of volatile organic components during the thermal stability testing. The treated PSCs demonstrate efficiency of 19.28% (active area of 58.5 cm2) and 17.62% (aperture area of 64 cm2) for the corresponding mini&#8208;module. More importantly, unencapsulated slot&#8208;die coated mini&#8208;modules incorporating the all&#8208;organic surface modifier show &#8764;80% efficiency retention after 7,500 hours (313 days) of storage under 30% relative humidity (RH). They also remarkably retain more than 90% of the initial efficiency for over 850 hours while being measured continuously.

         <title>Protophilic MOF Enables Ni&#8208;Rich Lithium Battery Stable Cycling in a High Water/Acid Content</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Trace protic impurities, such as water and hydrofluoric acid (HF), can severely degrade the stable and long cycling of lithium batteries. Therefore, the costly water removal process is inevitably needed throughout production of lithium batteries, leaving the paradox that energy&#8208;saving lithium battery technology consumes nonnegligible amounts of energy. Herein, we report a unique ionic metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) enables highly destructive H2O/HF&#8208;tolerance lithium batteries. The isolated ionic fluorine sites in MOF exhibit unusual protophilicity and efficiently capture ppm&#8208;levels H2O/HF from the highly polar electrolyte solvents. The resulting MOF&#8208;based LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2&#9474;Li battery achieves over 300 cycles in the presence of 800&#160;ppm H2O or 1107&#160;ppm acidic impurity. This 10&#8208;fold longer battery lifespan relative to those for batteries with conventional standard separators demonstrates its excellent electrochemical cycling performance. Our results reveal that the rational use of unique nanoporous features of MOFs could provide new possibilities for long&#8208;standing challenges in the lithium battery industry.

Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed perovskites are promising for hard X&#8208;ray and gamma ray detection, but there has been limited reports on their performance under extremely intense X&#8208;rays. Here, we report a solution&#8208;grown all&#8208;inorganic perovskite CsPbBr3 single crystal semiconductor detector capable of operating at ultra&#8208;high X&#8208;ray flux of 1010 photons s&#8722;1 mm&#8722;2. High&#8208;quality solution&#8208;grown CsPbBr3 single crystals were fabricated into detectors with a Schottky diode structure of eutectic gallium indium/CsPbBr3/Au. A high reverse bias voltage of 1000&#160;V (435&#160;V mm&#8722;1) can be applied with a small and stable dark current of &#8764; 60 &#8211; 70 nA (&#8764; 9 &#8211; 10 nA mm&#8722;2), which enabled a high sensitivity larger than 10000 &#956;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and a simultaneous low detection limit of 22 nGyair s&#8722;1. The CsPbBr3 semiconductor detector showed an excellent photocurrent linearity and reproducibility under 58.61&#160;keV synchrotron X&#8208;ray with flux from 106 to 1010 photons s&#8722;1 mm&#8722;2. Defect characterization by thermally stimulated current spectroscopy showed a similar low defect density of a synchrotron X&#8208;ray and a lab X&#8208;ray irradiated device. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy suggests that the excellent performance of the solution&#8208;grown CsPbBr3 single crystal may be associated with its good short&#8208;range order, comparable to the spectrometer&#8208;grade melt&#8208;grown CsPbBr3.

         <title>A Novel Ultra&#8208;wideband Electromagnetic Wave&#8208;absorbing Metastructure Inspired by Bionic Gyroid Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Traditional honeycomb&#8208;like structural electromagnetic (EM) wave&#8208;absorbing materials have been widely used in various equipment as multifunctional materials. However, current EM wave&#8208;absorbing materials are limited by narrow absorption bandwidths and incident angles because of anisotropic structural morphology. The work presented here proposes a novel EM wave&#8208;absorbing metastructure with an isotropic morphology inspired by the gyroid microstructures seen in Parides sesostris butterfly wings. A matching redesign methodology between the material and subwavelength scale properties of the gyroid microstructure is proposed, inspired by the interaction mechanism between microstructure and material properties on the EM wave&#8208;absorption performance of the prepared metastructure. Bioinspired metastructure is fabricated by additive manufacturing (AM) and subsequent coating through dipping processes, filled with dielectric lossy materials. Based on simulations and experiments, the metastructure designed in this work exhibits an ultra&#8208;wide absorption bandwidth covering the frequency range of 2&#8211;40&#160;GHz with a fractional bandwidth of 180% at normal incidence. Moreover, the metastructure has a stable frequency response when the incident angle is 60&#176; under the transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarization. Finally, the synergistic mechanism between microstructure and material is elucidated, which provides a new paradigm for the design of novel ultra&#8208;broadband EM absorbing materials.

         <title>Short Peptide Nanofiber Biomaterials Ameliorate Local Hemostatic Capacity of Surgical Materials and Intraoperative Hemostatic Applications in Clinics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Short designer self&#8208;assembling peptide (dSAP) biomaterials are a new addition to hemostat group. It may provide diverse and robust toolboxes for surgeon to integrate wound microenvironment with much safer and stronger hemostatic capacity than conventional materials and hemostatic agents. Especially in noncompressible torso hemorrhage (NCTH), diffuse mucosal surface bleeding, and internal medical bleeding (IMB), et&#160;al., with respect to the optimal hemostatic formulation, dSAP biomaterials are the ingenious nanofiber alternatives to make bioactive neural scaffold, nasal packing, large mucosal surface coverage in gastrointestinal surgery (esophagus, gastric lesion, duodenum, and lower digestive tract), epicardiac cell delivery carrier, transparent matrix barrier, et&#160;al. Herein, in multiple surgical specialties, dSAP biomaterials&#8208;based nano hemostats achieve safe, effective and immediate hemostasis, facile wound healing, and potentially reduce the risks in delayed bleeding, rebleeding, postoperative bleeding or related complications. The biosafety in vivo, bleeding indications, tissue&#8208;sealing quality, surgical feasibility, and local usability are addressed comprehensively and sequentially and pursued to develop useful surgical techniques with better hemostatic performance. This article provides the state of art and all&#8208;round advancements of nano hemostatic approaches in surgery. Relevant critical insights will inspire exciting investigations on peptide nanotechnology, next&#8208;generation biomaterials, and better promising prospects in clinics.

         <title>Magnetic&#8211;Acoustic Sequentially Actuated CAR T Cell Microrobots for Precision Navigation and In Situ Antitumor Immunoactivation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
M&#8208;CAR Ts are created by decorating CAR T cells with immunomagnetic beads using click conjugation, and they are capable of magnetic&#8211;acoustic actuation for precision targeting and antitumor immune responses, resulting in a 6.6&#8208;fold increase in accumulated CAR T. Anti&#8208;CD3/CD28 immunomagnetic beads stimulate infiltrated CAR T proliferation and activation in situ, significantly enhancing their antitumor efficacy.








Abstract
Despite its clinical success, chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T)&#8208;cell immunotherapy remains limited in solid tumors, owing to the harsh physical barriers and immunosuppressive microenvironment. Here a CAR&#8208;T&#8208;cell&#8208;based live microrobot (M&#8208;CAR T) is created by decorating CAR T with immunomagnetic beads using click conjugation. M&#8208;CAR Ts are capable of magnetic&#8211;acoustic actuation for precision targeting and in situ activation of antitumor immune responses. Sequential actuation endows M&#8208;CAR Ts with magnetically actuated anti&#8208;flow and obstacle avoidance as well as tissue penetration driven by acoustic propulsion, enabling efficient migration and accumulation in artificial tumor models. In vivo, sequentially actuated M&#8208;CAR Ts achieves long&#8208;distance targeting and accumulate at the peritumoural area under programmable magnetic guidance, and subsequently acoustic tweezers actuate M&#8208;CAR Ts to migrate&#160;into deep tumor tissues, resulting in a 6.6&#8208;fold increase in accumulated exogenous CD8+ CAR T cells compared with that without actuation. Anti&#8208;CD3/CD28 immunomagnetic beads stimulate infiltrated CAR T proliferation and activation in situ, significantly enhancing their antitumor efficacy. Thus, this&#160;sequential&#8208;actuation&#8208;guided cell microrobot combines the merits of autonomous targeting and penetration of intelligent robots with in situ T&#8208;cell immunoactivation, and holds considerable promise for precision navigation and cancer immunotherapies.

         <title>Effects of Multiple Ion Reactions Based on a CoSe2/MXene Cathode in Aluminum&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aluminum&#8208;ion cathode material based on an array&#160;of&#160;MXene lamellar CoSe2 nanoparticles is designed and synthesized. The lattice distortion brought by the AlCl4&#8722; ion embedding has a serious impact on the initial stability of the battery, and such distortion consumes extra energy, making it difficult for the Coulombic efficiency to reach close to 100%.








Abstract
Rechargeable aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (RAIBs) have emerged as a promising battery storage technology owing to their cost&#8208;effectiveness, operational safety, and high energy density. However, their actual capacity is substantially lower than their true capacity and their cycling stability is poor. Therefore, understanding the energy&#8208;storage mechanism may contribute to the successful design of a stable electrode material, on which the performance can be optimized. The aim of this study is to investigate AlCl4&#8722; ions in transition metal cathode materials and mechanisms that enable for their high&#8208;energy&#8208;storage potential and low Coulombic efficiency. Results of theoretical analysis and experimental verification show that a multi&#8208;ion transport mechanism is responsible for the electrochemical behavior of the battery. The lattice distortion of CoSe2 caused by AlCl4&#8722; ion intercalation, has a considerable effect on the initial stability of the battery. MXene as a support material reduces the size of CoSe2 growing on its surface, effectively inhibiting the lattice distortion caused by the interaction with the aluminum&#8208;anion complex, thus addressing the issues of poor reversibility, cycle instability, and low Coulombic efficiency of the battery. Hence, understanding the impact of MXene on the battery may aid in further improving the design of electrode materials.

         <title>Mobile Trions in Electrically Tunable 2D Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrically controlled, bipolar tuning of the excitonic light emission is achieved in 2D perovskites via the field effect in a van der Waals heterostructure. The formation of trions with exceptionally high binding energies up to 46&#160;meV is demonstrated. Localized at liquid helium temperature, these charged excitons become mobile toward 50&#160;K with effective mobilities up to 200 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1.








Abstract
2D hybrid perovskites are currently in the spotlight of material research for light&#8208;harvesting and &#8208;emitting applications. It remains extremely challenging, however, to externally control their optical response due to the difficulties of introducing electrical doping. Here, an approach of interfacing ultrathin sheets of perovskites with few&#8208;layer graphene and hexagonal boron nitride into gate&#8208;tunable, hybrid heterostructures, is demonstrated. It allows for bipolar, continuous tuning of light emission and absorption in 2D perovskites by electrically injecting carriers to densities as high as 1012&#160;cm&#8722;2. This reveals the emergence of both negatively and positively charged excitons, or trions, with binding energies up to 46&#160;meV, among the highest measured for 2D systems. Trions are shown to dominate light emission and propagate with mobilities reaching 200&#160;cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 at elevated temperatures. The findings introduce the physics of interacting mixtures of optical and electrical excitations to the broad family of 2D inorganic&#8211;organic nanostructures. The presented strategy to electrically control the optical response of 2D perovskites highlights it as a promising material platform toward electrically modulated light&#8208;emitters, externally guided charged exciton currents, and exciton transistors based on layered, hybrid&#160;semiconductors.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;fast Piezocatalysts Enabled By Interfacial Interaction of Reduced Graphene Oxide/MoS2 Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rGO&#8208;MoS2 heterostructure (GMH) shows a record&#8208;high piezo&#8208;catalytic degradation rate and can totally degrade the organic dyes within 50 s. The fundamental interfacial phenomena and the charge transfer in GMH are carefully examined by theoretical and experimental methods. It opens a new door for creation of new piezo&#8208;catalysts and toward a deeper understanding of the mechanism of piezo&#8208;catalysis.








Abstract
The catalytic activity has been investigated in 2D materials, and the unique structural and electronic properties contribute to their success in conventional heterogeneous catalysis. Heterojunction&#8208;based piezocatalysis has attracted increasing attention due to the band&#8208;structure engineering and the enhanced charge carrier separation by prominent piezoelectric effect. However, the piezocatalytic behavior of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures is still unknown, and the finite active sites, catalyst poisoning, and poor conductivity are challenges for developing good piezocatalysts. Herein, a reduced graphene oxide (rGO)&#8208;MoS2 heterostructure is rationally designed to tackle these challenges. The heterostructure shows a record&#8208;high piezocatalytic degradation rate of 1.40 &#215; 102 L mol&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, which is 7.86 times higher than MoS2 nanosheets. Piezoresponse force microscope measurements and density functional theory calculation reveal that the coupling between semiconductive and piezoelectric properties in the vdW heterojunction is vital to break the metallic state screening effect at the MoS2 edge for keeping the piezoelectric potential. The dynamic charges generated by MoS2 and the fast charge transfer in rGO activate and maintain catalytically active sites for pollutant degradation with an ultra&#8208;fast rate and good stability. The working mechanism opens new avenues for developing efficient catalysts significant to wastewater treatments and other applications.

         <title>Tailoring Molecular&#8208;Scale Contact at Perovskite/Polymeric Hole Transporting Material Interface for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have delivered more than 25% of power conversion efficiency (PCE) and incorporating polymers as hole transporting layers (HTLs) can further enhance the stability of devices towards the goal of commercialization. Among various polymeric hole transporting materials, poly(triaryl amine) (PTAA) is one of the promising HTL candidates with good stability; however, the hydrophobicity of PTAA causes problematic interfacial contact with perovskite, limiting the device performance. Using molecular side&#8208;chain engineering, we successfully constructed a uniform two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite interlayer with conjugated ligands, between three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskites and PTAA. Further, employing conjugated ligands as cohesive elements, perovskite/PTAA interfacial adhesion was significantly improved. As a result, the thin and lateral extended 2D/3D heterostructure enabled the as&#8208;fabricated PTAA&#8208;based PSCs to achieve a PCE of 23.7%, improved from the 18% of reference devices. Owing to the increased ion migration energy barrier and conformal 2D coating, unencapsulated devices with the new ligands exhibited both superior thermal stability under 60&#176;C heating and moisture stability in ambient conditions.

         <title>RAINBOW Organic Solar Cells: Implementing Spectral Splitting in Lateral Multi&#8208;Junction Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
While multi&#8208;junction geometries have the potential to boost the efficiency of organic solar cells, the experimental gains yet obtained are still very modest. This work proposes an alternative spectral splitting device concept in which various individual semiconducting junctions with cascading band gaps are laid side by side, thus the name RAINBOW. Each lateral sub&#8208;cell receives a fraction of the spectrum that closely matches the main absorption band of the given semiconductor. Here, simulations are used to identify the important material and device properties of each RAINBOW sub&#8208;cell. Using the resulting design rules, three systems are selected, namely PBDB&#8208;T&#8208;2F:IO&#8208;4Cl, PBDB&#8208;T&#8208;2F:Y6 and PTB7&#8208;Th:COTIC&#8208;4F, and their potential as sub&#8208;cells in this geometry is experimentally investigated. With the aid of a custom built setup that generates spectrally spread sunlight on demand, the simulations are experimentally validated, showing that this geometry can lead to a reduction in thermalization losses and an improvement in light harvesting, which results in a relative improvement in efficiency of 46.6% with respect to the best sub&#8208;cell. Finally, a working proof of concept monolithic device consisting of two sub&#8208;cells deposited from solution on the same substrate is fabricated, thus demonstrating the feasibility and the potential of the RAINBOW solar cell concept.

         <title>Bifunctional Gas Diffusion Electrode Enables In&#8208;situ Separation and Conversion of CO2 to Ethylene from Dilute Stream</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The requirement of concentrated CO2 feedstock significantly limits the economic feasibility of electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) as it often involves multiple intermediate processes, including CO2 capture, energy intensive regeneration, compression, and transportation steps. Herein, we report on a bifunctional gas diffusion electrode (BGDE) for separation and electrolysis of CO2 from a low concentration CO2 stream (&#8764;10 vol%). We demonstrate a BGDE for selective production of ethylene (C2H4) by combining high density polyethylene&#8208;derived porous carbon (HPC) as a physisorbent with polycrystalline copper as conversion catalyst. Our BGDE shows substantial tolerance to 10 vol% CO2 exhibiting a Faradaic efficiency of &#8764;45% towards C2H4 at a current density of 80&#160;mA/cm2 over 11&#160;hrs, outperforming previous reports that utilised such partial pressure (PCO2 = 0.1 atm and above) at ambient conditions and unaltered polycrystalline copper as catalyst. Molecular dynamics simulation and mixed gas permeability assessment reveal that such selective performance is ensured by high CO2 uptake of microporous HPC as well as continuous desorption owing to molecular diffusion and concentration gradient created by binary flow (CO2|N2) within sorbent boundary. We conclude based on detailed technoeconomic analysis that our in&#8208;situ process has the potential to be economically compelling by precluding the C2H4 production cost associated with the energy intensive intermediate steps of conventional decoupled process.

         <title>Ti3C2Tx MXene van der Waals gate contact for GaN high electron mobility transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Gate controllability is a key factor that determines the performance of GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs). However, at traditional metal&#8208;GaN interface, direct chemical interaction between metal and GaN can result in fixed charges and traps, which can significantly deteriorate the gate controllability. In this study, Ti3C2Tx MXene films were integrated into GaN HEMTs as the gate contact, wherein van der Waals heterojunctions were formed between MXene films and GaN without direct chemical bonding. The GaN HEMTs with enhanced gate controllability exhibited an extremely low off&#8208;state current (IOFF) of 10&#8722;7&#160;mA/mm, a record high ION/IOFF current ratio of &#8764;1013 (which is six orders of magnitude higher than conventional Ni/Au contact), a high off&#8208;state drain breakdown voltage of 1085&#160;V, and a near&#8208;ideal subthreshold swing of 61&#160;mV/dec. This work shows the great potential of MXene films as gate electrodes in wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductor devices.

Abstract
Bacterial infections, such as bacterial keratitis (BK) and subcutaneous abscess, pose significant challenges to global healthcare. Innovative and new antibacterial agents and antibacterial strategies are in demand to control infections in this era of high drug resistance. Nanotechnology gradually emerged as an economically feasible and effective anti&#8208;infection treatment. High&#8208;entropy MXenes (HE MXenes) are used to confer desirable properties with exposed active sites to high&#8208;entropy atomic layers, whose potential application in the field of biomedicine remains to be explored. Herein, we fabricate the monolayer HE MXenes by implementing transition metals with high entropy and low Gibbs free energy to fill the gap in the biocatalytic performance of non&#8208;high&#8208;entropy MXenes. HE MXenes are endowed with extremely strong oxidase mimic activity (Km = 0.227&#160;mM) and photothermal conversion efficiency (65.8%) in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) biowindow as entropy increases. Subsequently, HE MXenes realize NIR&#8208;II&#8208;enhanced intrinsic oxidase mimic activity for killing methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus and rapidly removing the biofilm. Furthermore, HE MXenes can effectively treat BK and subcutaneous abscess infection induced by MRSA as nanotherapeutic agents with minuscule side effects. Overall, monolayer HE MXenes demonstrate promising clinical application potential in the treatment of drug&#8208;resistant bacterial infections and promote the healing of infected tissues.

         <title>Reconfigurable Multilevel Optical PUF by Spatiotemporally Programmed Crystallization of Supersaturated Solution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Physical unclonable function (PUF) is emerging as an alternative to information security by providing an advanced level of cryptographic keys with non&#8208;replicable characteristics, yet the cryptographic keys of the conventional PUFs are not reconfigurable from the ones assigned at the manufacturing stage and the overall authentication process slows down as the number of entities in the dataset or the length of cryptographic key increases. Herein, we present a supersaturated solution&#8208;based PUF (S&#8208;PUF) that utilizes stochastic crystallization of a supersaturated sodium acetate solution to allow a time&#8208;efficient, hierarchical authentication process together with on&#8208;demand rewritability of cryptographic keys. By controlling the orientation and the average grain size of the sodium acetate crystals via a spatiotemporally programmed temperature profile, S&#8208;PUF now includes two global variables, i.e., angle of rotation and divergence of the diffracted beam, in addition to the speckle pattern to produce multilevel cryptographic keys, and these variables function as prefixes for the classification of each entity for a fast authentication process. At the same time, the reversible phase change of sodium acetate enables repeated reconfiguration of the cryptographic key, which is expected to offer new possibilities for a next&#8208;generation, recyclable anti&#8208;counterfeiting platform.

Abstract
Negative capacitance field&#8208;effect transistors (NC&#8208;FETs) have gathered enormous interest as a way to reduce subthreshold swing (SS) and overcome the issue of power dissipation in modern integrated circuits. For stable NC behavior at low operating voltages, the development of ultrathin ferroelectrics, which are compatible with the industrial process, is of great interest. Here, we develop a new scalable ultrathin ferroelectric polymer layer based on CCl3&#8208;terminated P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) to achieve the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance of NC&#8208;FETs. The crystalline phase of 5&#8764;10&#160;nm ultrathin P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) is prepared on AlOX by a newly&#8208;developed brush method, which enables a ferroelectric (FE)/dielectric (DE) bilayer. FE/DE thickness ratios are then systematically tuned at ease to achieve ideal capacitance matching. NC&#8208;FETs with optimized FE/DE thickness at thickness limit demonstrate hysteresis&#8208;free operation with SS of 28&#160;mV/dec at &#8764;1.5&#160;V, which competes with the best reports. Our P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)&#8208;brush layer can be broadly adapted to NC&#8208;FETs, opening an exciting avenue for low&#8208;power devices.

         <title>A Biocompatible Supercapacitor Diode with Enhanced Rectification Capability towards Ion/Electron Coupling Logic Operations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The main challenge faced by the forthcoming human&#8208;computer interaction is that biological system and electronic device adopt two different information carriers, i.e., ions and electrons, respectively. To bridge the gap between these two systems, developing ion/electron coupling devices for logic operation is a feasible and effective approach. Accordingly, we herein develop a supercapacitor&#8208;based ionic diode (CAPode) that takes electrochemically amorphized molybdenum oxide as the working electrode. Benefiting from its unique size and charge dual ion&#8208;sieving effects, the molybdenum oxide electrode exhibits a record&#8208;high rectification ratio of 136, which is over 10 times higher than those of reported systems. It also delivers an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 448 F g&#8722;1 and an excellent cycling stability of up to 20,000 cycles, greatly outperforming those of previous works. These excellent rectification capability and electrochemical performances allow the as&#8208;built CAPode to work well in AND and OR logic gates, validating great potential in ion/electron coupling logic operations. More attractively, the superior biocompatibilities of molybdenum oxide and relevant constituent materials enable the constructed CAPode to be applied as bioelectronics without regard to biosafety, paving a new way towards forthcoming human&#8208;computer interaction.

         <title>Toughening Double Network Hydrogels by Polyelectrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hoffmeister effect of inorganic salts has been verified as a promising way to toughen hydrogels, however, the high concentration of inorganic salts may accompany by poor biocompatibility. In this work, for the first time, we find that polyelectrolytes can obviously elevate the mechanical performances of hydrogels through Hoffmeister effect. The introduction of anionic poly(sodium acrylate) (P(iAA)) into poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel induces the aggregation and crystallization of PVA to boost the mechanical properties of the resulting double network hydrogel: elevation of 73, 64, 28, 135, and 19 times in the tensile strength, compressive strength, Young's modulus, toughness, and fracture energy compared with poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), respectively. It is noteworthy that the mechanical performances of the hydrogels can be flexibly tuned by the variation of polyelectrolyte concentration, ionization degree, relative hydrophobicity of the ionic component and polyelectrolyte type in a wide range. This strategy is verified to work for other Hoffmeister effect&#8208;sensitive polymers and polyelectrolytes. Also, the introduction of urea bonds into polyelectrolytes can further improve the mechanical properties and anti&#8208;swelling capability of hydrogels. As a biomedical patch, the advanced hydrogel can efficiently inhibit hernia formation and promote the regeneration of soft tissues in abdominal wall defect model.

Abstract
DNA double helices containing metal&#8208;mediated DNA (mmDNA) base pairs have been constructed from Ag+ and Hg2+ ions between pyrimidine:pyrimidine pairs with the promise of nanoelectronics. Rational design of mmDNA nanomaterials has been impractical without a complete lexical and structural description. Here, we explore the programmability of structural DNA nanotechnology toward its founding mission of self&#8208;assembling a diffraction platform for biomolecular structure determination. We employed the tensegrity triangle to build a comprehensive structural library of mmDNA pairs via X&#8208;ray diffraction and elucidated generalized design rules for mmDNA construction. We uncovered two binding modes: N3&#8208;dominant, centrosymmetric pairs and major groove binders driven by 5&#8208;position ring modifications. Energy gap calculations showed additional levels in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of mmDNA structures, rendering them attractive molecular electronic candidates.

         <title>Unified Therapeutic&#8208;Prophylactic Tissue Engineering Scaffold Demonstrated to Prevent Tumor Recurrence and Overcoming Infection toward Bone Remodeling</title>

Abstract
Osteosarcoma occurs in children and adolescents frequently and leads to a high fatality rate. Although surgical resection is the most common methods in clinic, patients always suffer from tumor metastasis and recurrence and the large bone defects are difficulty for the patients to self&#8208;repair. Furthermore, the postoperative infection from bacteria triggers an inflammatory response and hinders the bone&#8208;repair process. This work demonstrates a gadolinium (Gd)&#8208;complex and molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) co&#8208;doped N&#8208;acryloyl glycinamide (NAGA)/gelatin methacrylate (Gel&#8208;MA) multifunctional hydrogel (GMNG). The combination between NAGA and Gel&#8208;MA endows the GMNG with attractive mechanical properties and controllable degradation ability. The MoS2 improve the hydrogel system with excellent photothermal ability to kill tumor cells and inhibit bacterial infection both in vitro and in vivo. Based on Gd&#8208;complex, the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) effect can be used to monitor the position and degradation situation of the hydrogel. Notably, accompanied by the degradation of GMNG hydrogel, the gradual released Gd3+ from the hydrogel exhibits osteogenic property and could promote new bone formation efficiently in vivo. Therefore, our strategy supplies a method to prepare multifunctional bone defect repair materials and is expected to play a significant guidance and reference to the development of biomaterials for bone tissue engineering.
Osteosarcoma, a kind of malignant bone tumors, is considered to be an extremely challenging disease in clinic due to the high probability of recurrence and metastasis, leading to the 5&#8208;year overall survival rate of less than 20%.[1] Resection surgery is the traditional and most useful strategy to cure osteosarcoma, however, tumor recurrence and postoperative infection is one of the problems faced by patients after surgery. Although radiotherapy and chemotherapy have been used in clinic, systemic side effects are still inevitable.[2] Faced with such a situation, photothermal therapy (PTT), a non&#8208;invasive treatment, is of great interest to researchers and has been applied in wound healing,[3] cancer therapy,[4] metabolism adjustment,[5] and so on. Based on the reliable tissue penetration, high energy, and almost no thermal damage to the skin, 808&#160;nm near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light has been widely applied in the medical field as a trigger for the photothermal effect.[7] Meanwhile, a series of photothermal materials have been discovered, such as black phosphorus (BP),[7] MXene,[8] black titanium dioxide,[9] etc. Molybdenum sulfide (MoS2), a well&#8208;known 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) that is easily prepared by a hydrothermal method and has good photothermal conversion efficiency,[10] will be used in our system as the photothermal agent to prevent osteosarcoma recurrence and even bacterial infection after artificial material implantation. Compared with the mechanical exfoliation and chemical vapor deposition methods for the preparation of monolayer MoS2 nanosheets, solution&#8208;based methods show some advantages such as high yields and relatively mild reaction conditions. It can be subdivided into liquid phase exfoliation (top&#8208;down method) and wet chemical synthesis (bottom&#8208;up method). The liquid phase exfoliation method is limited by the addition of multiple chemicals such as reaction reagents, solvents or surfactants, and its yield and quality become difficulty to control. In contrast, the wet chemical method is a typical bottom&#8208;up process to prepare MoS2 nanosheets. This strategy has the following advantages: a) the precursors are inexpensive metal salts; b) the prepared MoS2 nanosheets are uniform in size and high in yield; c) they can be easily dispersed and separated; and d) the diverse chemical properties and solubility provide a rich platform for chemical functionalization in solution and hybridization with other materials.[11] Thus, MoS2 prepared by the wet chemical synthesis method show some prospects as photothermal materials. In addition, it has been confirmed that mild heat stimulation (40&#8208;45&#176;C) can promote cell viability, leading to a self&#8208;healing or regeneration of skin, blood vessels and bone; moderate heat stimulation (45&#8208;50&#176;C) can kill tumor and bacteria effectively by inducing the collapse of cytomembranes and inactivation of protein without influencing normal cells; while excessive thermal exposure (&gt;55&#176;C) would cause tissue burns and should be avoided.[12] Therefore, the influence of power density and photothermal agent concentration will also be discussed in our system.

         <title>Rapid and Direct Liquid&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Luminescent Metal Halide Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward strategy to rapidly and directly crystallize luminescent metal halide nanocrystals into close&#8208;packed face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (FCC) superlattices during the liquid&#8208;phase synthesis is demonstrated. The concomitant nanocrystal growth and superlattice formation process is governed by the interplay between the nanocrystal size and surface&#8208;coating ligand.








Abstract
The crystallization of nanocrystal building blocks into artificial superlattices has emerged as an efficient approach for tailoring the nanoscale properties and functionalities of novel devices. To date, ordered arrays of colloidal metal halide nanocrystals have mainly been achieved by using post&#8208;synthetic strategies. Here, a rapid and direct liquid&#8208;phase synthesis is presented to achieve a highly robust crystallization of luminescent metal halide nanocrystals into perfect face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (FCC) superlattices on the micrometer scale. The continuous growth of individual nanocrystals is observed within the superlattice, followed by the disassembly of the superlattices into individually dispersed nanocrystals owing to the highly repulsive interparticle interactions induced by large nanocrystals. Transmission electron microscopy characterization reveals that owing to an increase in solvent entropy, the structure of the superlattices transforms from FCC to hexagonal close&#8208;packed (HCP) and the nanocrystals disassemble. The FCC superlattice exhibits a single and slightly redshifted emission, due to the reabsorption&#8208;free property of the building block units. Compared to individual nanocrystals, the superlattices have three times higher quantum yield with improved environmental stability, making them ideal for use as ultrabright blue&#8208;light emitters. This study is expected to facilitate the creation of metamaterials with ordered nanocrystal structures and their practical applications.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning Assisted Electronic Skins Capable of Proprioception and Exteroception in Soft Robotics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;sensing of their body shape is significant for soft robots planning trajectories and actions, which can also be a feedback to interactions with the environment. We&#160;present a shape&#8208;sensing electronic skin, confluence with machine learning technique, endows soft robots with proprioception of their own status and exteroception of environment awareness, exhibiting advanced artificial intelligence.








Abstract
Inspired by natural biological systems, soft robots have recently been developed, showing tremendous potential in real&#8208;world applications because of their intrinsic softness and deformability. The confluence of electronic skins and machine learning is extensively studied to create effective biomimetic robotic systems. Based on a differential piezoelectric matrix, this study presents a shape&#8208;sensing electronic skin (SSES) that can recognize surface conformations with minimal interference from pressing, stretching, or other surrounding stimuli. It is then integrated with soft robots to reconstruct their shape during movement, serving as a proprioceptive sense. Additionally, the robot can utilize machine learning to identify various terrains, demonstrating exteroception and pointing toward more advanced autonomous robots capable of performing real&#8208;world tasks in challenging environments.

Based on a differential piezoelectric matrix, this study presents a shape-sensing electronic skin (SSES) that can recognize surface conformations with minimal interference from pressing, stretching, or other surrounding stimuli. It is then integrated with soft robots to reconstruct their shape during movement, serving as a proprioceptive sense. Additionally, the robot can utilize machine learning to identify various terrains, demonstrating exteroception and pointing toward more advanced autonomous robots capable of performing real-world tasks in challenging environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Preventing Vanishing Gradient Problem of Hardware Neuromorphic System by Implementing Imidazole&#8208;Based Memristive ReLU Activation Neuron</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
With advances in artificial intelligent services, brain&#8208;inspired neuromorphic systems with synaptic devices have recently attracted significant interest to circumvent the von Neumann bottleneck. However, the increasing trend of deep neural network parameters causes huge power consumption and large area overhead of a nonlinear neuron electronic circuit, and it incurs a vanishing gradient problem. Here, we present a memristor&#8208;based compact and energy&#8208;efficient neuron device to implement a rectifying linear unit (ReLU) activation function. To emulate the volatile and gradual switching of the ReLU function, we propose a copolymer memristor with a hybrid structure using a copolymer/inorganic bilayer. The functional copolymer film developed by introducing imidazole functional groups enables the formation of nanocluster&#8208;type pseudo&#8208;conductive filaments by boosting the nucleation of Cu nanoclusters, causing gradual switching. The ReLU neuron device is successfully demonstrated by integrating the memristor with an amorphous InGaZnO thin&#8208;film transistors, and achieves 0.5 pJ of energy consumption based on sub&#8208;10&#160;&#956;A operation current and high&#8208;speed switching of 650&#160;ns. Furthermore, device&#8208;to&#8208;system&#8208;level simulation using neuron devices on the MNIST dataset demonstrates that the vanishing gradient problem is effectively resolved by five&#8208;layer deep neural networks. The proposed neuron device will enable the implementation of high&#8208;density and energy&#8208;efficient hardware neuromorphic systems.

         <title>Light&#8208;driven Self&#8208;recruitment of Biomimetic Semiconducting Polymer Nanoparticles for Precise Tumor Vascular Disruption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Tumor vascular disrupting therapy has offered promising opportunities to treat cancer in clinical practice, whereas the overall therapeutic efficacy is notably limited due to the off&#8208;target effects and repeated dose toxicity of vascular disrupting agents (VDAs). To tackle this problem, we herein report a VDA&#8208;free biomimetic semiconducting polymer nanoparticle (SPNP) for precise tumor vascular disruption through two&#8208;stage light manipulation. SPNP consists of a semiconducting polymer nanoparticle as the photothermal agent camouflaged with platelet membranes that specifically target disrupted vasculature. Upon the first photoirradiation, SPNP administered in vivo generates mild hyperthermia to trigger tumor vascular hemorrhage, which activates the coagulation cascade and recruits more SPNP to injured blood vessels. Such enhanced tumor vascular targeting of photothermal agents enables intense hyperthermia to destroy the tumor vasculature during the second photoirradiation, leading to complete tumor eradication and efficient metastasis inhibition. Intriguingly, the mechanism study revealed that this vascular disruption strategy alleviates splenomegaly and reverses the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by reducing myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells. Therefore, this study not only illustrates a light&#8208;driven self&#8208;recruitment strategy to enhance tumor vascular disruption via a single dose of biomimetic therapeutics but also deciphers the immunotherapeutic role of vascular disruption therapy that is conducive to clinical studies.

         <title>Pillararene&#8208;Based Supramolecular Polymers for Adsorption and Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Supramolecular polymers have attracted increasing attention in recent years due to their perfect combination of supramolecular chemistry and traditional polymer chemistry. The design and synthesis of macrocycles have driven the rapid development of supramolecular chemistry and polymer science. Pillar[n]arenes, a new generation of macrocyclic compounds possessing unique pillar&#8208;shaped structures, nano&#8208;sized cavities, multi&#8208;functionalized groups, and excellent host&#8211;guest complexation abilities, are promising candidates to construct supramolecular polymer materials with enhanced properties and functionalities. This review summarizes recent progress in the design and synthesis of pillararene&#8208;based supramolecular polymers (PSPs) and illustrates their diverse applications as adsorption and separation materials. All performances are evaluated and analyzed in terms of efficiency, selectivity, and recyclability. Typically, PSPs can be categorized into three typical types according to their topologies, including linear, cross&#8208;linked, and hybrid structures. The advances made in the area of functional supramolecular polymeric adsorbents formed by novel pillararene derivatives are also described in detail. Finally, the remaining challenges and future perspectives of PSPs for separation&#8208;based materials science are discussed. We&#160;envision that this review will inspire new researchers in different fields and stimulate creative designs of supramolecular polymeric materials based on pillararenes and other macrocycles for effective adsorption and separation of a variety of targets.

         <title>Electric Control of 2D Van Hove Singularity in Oxide Ultra&#8208;Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A van Hove singularity (VHS) possesses an infinite density of states at a certain energy point when it exists in two dimensions. By taking advantage of this two&#8208;dimensional VHS property, it is demonstrated that the type of charge carrier can be tuned in oxide ultrathin film systems, showing the potential for practical devices.








Abstract
Divergent density of states (DOS) can induce extraordinary phenomena such as significant enhancement of superconductivity and unexpected phase transitions. Moreover, van Hove singularities (VHSs) lead to divergent DOS in 2D systems. Despite recent interest in VHSs, only a few controllable cases have been reported to date. In this work, by utilizing an atomically ultra&#8208;thin SrRuO3 film, the electronic structure of a 2D VHS is investigated with angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy and transport properties are controlled. By applying electric fields with alkali metal deposition and ionic&#8208;liquid gating methods, the 2D VHS and the sign of the charge carrier are precisely controlled. Use of a tunable 2D VHS in an atomically flat oxide film could serve as a new strategy to realize infinite DOS near the Fermi level, thereby allowing efficient tuning of electric properties.

         <title>Principles for 2D&#8208;Material&#8208;Assisted Nitrides Epitaxial Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through systematically studying the crystallographic information of nitrides/2D materials&#160;interface, it is found that graphene is the ideal buffer layer for nitrides&#8217; remote epitaxy while WS2 for nitrides&#8217; van der Waals epitaxy. As a result, a suitable growth&#8208;front construction strategies and basic guidelines for high&#8208;quality 2D&#8208;materials&#8208;assisted nitrides&#8217; epitaxy is presented. This work may open a pathway toward various semiconductors heterointegration.








Abstract
Beyond traditional heteroepitaxy, 2D&#8208;materials&#8208;assisted epitaxy opens opportunities to revolutionize future material integration methods. However, basic principles in 2D&#8208;material&#8208;assisted nitrides&#8217; epitaxy remain unclear, which impedes understanding the essence, thus hindering its progress. Here, the crystallographic information of nitrides/2D material interface is theoretically established, which is further confirmed experimentally. It is found that the atomic interaction at the nitrides/2D material interface is related to the nature of underlying substrates. For single&#8208;crystalline substrates, the heterointerface behaves like a covalent one and the epilayer inherits the substrate's lattice. Meanwhile, for amorphous substrates, the heterointerface tends to be a van der Waals one and strongly relies on the properties of 2D materials. Therefore, modulated by graphene, the nitrides&#8217; epilayer is polycrystalline. In contrast, single&#8208;crystalline GaN films are successfully achieved on WS2. These results provide a suitable growth&#8208;front construction strategy for high&#8208;quality 2D&#8208;material&#8208;assisted nitrides&#8217; epitaxy. It also opens a pathway toward various semiconductors heterointegration.

Abstract
Despite highly promising for applications in emergent electronic devices, decoding ion&#8208;electron&#8208;lattice coupling in correlated materials at atomic scale and electronic band structure remains a big challenge due to the strong and complex correlation among these degrees of freedom. Here, taking epitaxial thin film of perovskite nickelate NdNiO3 as a model system, hydrogen ion induced giant lattice distortion and enhanced NiO6 octahedra rotation were demonstrated, which leads to a new robust hydrogenated HNdNiO3 phase with lattice expansion larger than 10% on a series of substrates. Moreover, under the effect of ion&#8208;electron synergistic doping, it is found that the proposed electronic antidoping, i.e., the doped electrons mainly fill the ground&#8208;state oxygen 2p holes instead of changing Ni oxidation state from Ni3+ to Ni2+, dominates the metal&#8208;insulator transition. While the lattice modification with enhanced Ni&#8208;O&#8208;Ni bond rotation mainly modifies the orbital density of states near the Fermi level. Lastly, by electric&#8208;field controlled hydrogen ion intercalation and its strong coupling to the lattice and electron charge, selective micrometer&#8208;scale patterns with distinct structural and electronic states were fabricated. The results provide direct evidences for a strong ion&#8208;electron&#8208;lattice coupling in correlated physics and exhibit its potential applications in designing novel materials and devices.

         <title>Oxidized Activated Charcoal Nanozymes: Synthesis, and Optimization for In Vitro and In Vivo Bioactivity for Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic nanozymes have recently been employed as promising antioxidant nanotherapeutics due to their distinct properties. The structural features responsible for the efficacy of these nanomaterials as antioxidants is, however, poorly understood. Here, we studied the process&#8208;structure&#8208;property&#8208;performance properties of coconut&#8208;derived oxidized activated charcoal (cOAC) nano&#8208;SOD mimetics by analyzing how modifications to the nanomaterial's synthesis impact the size, as well as the elemental and electrochemical properties of the particles. We then correlate these properties to the in vitro antioxidant bioactivity of poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;functionalized cOACs (PEG&#8208;cOAC). Chemical oxidative treatment methods that afford smaller, more homogeneous cOAC nanoparticles with higher levels of quinone functionalization show enhanced protection against oxidative damage in bEnd.3 murine endothelioma cells. In an in vivo rat model of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and oxidative vascular injury, PEG&#8208;cOACs restored cerebral perfusion rapidly to the same extent as our former nanotube&#8208;derived PEG&#8208;hydrophilic carbon clusters (PEG&#8208;HCCs) with a single intravenous injection. These findings provide fa deeper understanding for how carbon nanozyme syntheses can be tailored for improved antioxidant bioactivity, and set the stage for translation for medical applications.

         <title>Corrosion&#8208;Responsive Self&#8208;Healing Coatings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Organic coatings are one of the most popular and powerful strategies for protecting metals against corrosion. They can be applied to in different ways, such as by dipping, spraying, electrophoresis, casting, painting, or flow coating. They offer great flexibility of material designs and cost effectiveness. Moreover, since about 20 years self&#8208;healing has evolved as a new research topic for protective organic coatings. Responsive materials play a crucial role in this new research field. However, for a really targeted development of high performance self&#8208;healing coatings for corrosion protection, it is not sufficient just to focus on smart responsive materials and suitable active agents for self&#8208;healing. A better understanding of how coatings can react on different stimuli induced by corrosion, how these stimuli can spread in the coating and how the released agents can reach the corroding defect is also of high importance. Such knowledge would allow to design coatings which are optimised for specific applications. Herein, the requirements and possibilities from the corrosion and synthesis perspectives for designing materials for preparing self&#8208;healing coatings for corrosion protection are discussed.

         <title>Dynamic and Reversible Decoration of DNA&#8208;Based Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;based approach to decorating DNA&#8208;based scaffolds in a dynamic and reversible way is demonstrated. Enzyme&#8208;responsive strands in the assembled scaffolds undergo degradation and spontaneous replacement by strands decorated with different labels in the presence of their corresponding enzymes.








Abstract
An approach to achieving dynamic and reversible decoration of DNA&#8208;based scaffolds is demonstrated here. To do this, rationally engineered DNA tiles containing enzyme&#8208;responsive strands covalently conjugated to different molecular labels are employed. These strands are designed to be recognized and degraded by specific enzymes (i.e., Ribonuclease H, RNase H, or Uracil DNA Glycosylase, UDG) inducing their spontaneous de&#8208;hybridization from the assembled tile and replacement by a new strand conjugated to a different label. Multiple enzyme&#8208;responsive strands that specifically respond to different enzymes allow for dynamic, orthogonal, and reversible decoration of the DNA structures. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle of the strategy, the possibility to orthogonally control the distribution of different labels (i.e., fluorophores and small molecules) on the same scaffold without crosstalk is demonstrated. By doing so, DNA scaffolds that display different antibody recognition patterns are obtained. The approach offers the possibility to control the decoration of higher&#8208;order supramolecular assemblies (including origami) with several functional moieties to achieve functional biomaterials with improved adaptability, precision, and sensing capabilities.

         <dc:description>
Electro&#8208;opto&#8208;coupled silicon&#8208; and Mott&#8208;based integrated infrared photodetectors ares developed, which exhibit a large superlinear photoresponse (exponent &gt;18), an ultralow dark current of 4.46&#160;pA, high photocurrent on/off ratio (&gt;106), responsivity (&gt;1&#160;mA&#160;W&#8722;1), and great detectivity (&gt;1012&#160;Jones). Night vision pattern recognition even with noisy inputs is demonstrated, offering intensity&#8208;selective near&#8208;sensor vision processing.








Abstract
Light&#8208;intensity selective superlinear photodetectors with ultralow dark current can provide an essential breakthrough for the development of high&#8208;performing near&#8208;sensor vision processing. However, the development of near&#8208;sensor vision processing is not only conceptually important for device operation (given that sensors naturally exhibit linear/sublinear responses), but also essential to get rid of the massive amount of data generated during object sensing and classification with noisy inputs. Therefore, achieving the giant superlinear photoresponse while maintaining the picoampere leakage current, irrespective of the measurement bias, is one of the most challenging tasks. Here, Mott material (vanadium dioxide) and silicon&#8208;based integrated infrared photodetectors are developed that show giant superlinear photoresponse (exponent &gt;18) and ultralow dark current of 4.46&#160;pA. Specifically, the device demonstrates an electro&#8208;opto&#8208;coupled insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal transition, which leads to outstanding photocurrent on/off ratio (&gt;106), a high responsivity (&gt;1&#160;mA&#160;W&#8722;1), and excellent detectivity (&gt;1012&#160;Jones), while maintaining response speed (&#964;r&#160;=&#160;6&#160;&#181;s and &#964;f&#160;=&#160;10&#160;&#181;s). Further, intensity&#8208;selective near&#8208;sensor processing is demonstrated and night vision pattern reorganization even with noisy inputs is exhibited. This research will pave the way for the creation of high&#8208;performance photodetectors with potential uses, such as in night vision, pattern recognition, and neuromorphic processing.

         <title>N&#63743;B&#63743;OH Site&#8208;Activated Graphene Quantum Dots for Boosting Electrochemical Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density functional theory calculations predict that the edge structure involving edge N, B dopant pairs and further &#63743;OH functionalization to the B is an active center for 2 e&#8722; ORR. GQDs with an enriched density of N&#63743;B&#63743;OH show high H2O2 selectivity (over 90%), stability and H2O2 production rate (709 mmol&#160;gcatalyst&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1), superior to most reported carbon&#8208; and metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Carbon materials are considered promising 2/4 e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts for synthesizing H2O2/H2O via regulating heteroatom dopants and functionalization. Here, various doped and functionalized graphene quantum dots (GQDs) are designed to reveal the crucial active sites of carbon materials for ORR to produce H2O2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict that the edge structure involving edge N, B dopant pairs and further &#63743;OH functionalization to the B (N&#63743;B&#63743;OH) is an active center for 2e&#8722; ORR. To verify the above predication, GQDs with an enriched density of N&#63743;B&#63743;OH (NBO&#8208;GQDs) are designed and synthesized by the hydrothermal reaction of &#63743;NH2 edge&#8208;functionalized GQDs with H3BO3 forming six&#8208;member heterocycle containing the N&#63743;B&#63743;OH structure. When dispersed on conductive carbon substrates, the NBO&#8208;GQDs show H2O2 selectivity of over 90% at 0.7 &#8211;0.8 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode in the alkaline solution in a rotating ring&#8208;disk electrode setup. The selectivity retains 90% of the initial value after 12 h stability test. In a flow cell setup, the H2O2 production rate is up to 709 mmol gcatalyst&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, superior to most reported carbon&#8208; and metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. This work provides molecular insight into the design and formulation of highly efficient carbon&#8208;based catalysts for sustainable H2O2 production.

         <title>Liquid Crystal Elastomer Based Dexterous Artificial Motor Unit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under electrical stimulation, the actuation strain of the LCE&#8208;based motor unit can reach 45%, the strain rate is as high as 750%/s, and the output power density is as high as 1360&#160;W&#160;kg&#8208;1. It is further demonstrated that the LCE&#8208;based motor unit behaves more than an actuator and can be easily integrated into various artificial neuromuscular systems.








Abstract
Despite the great advancement in designing diverse soft robots, they are not yet as dexterous as animals in many aspects. One challenge is that they still lack the compact design of an artificial motor unit with a great comprehensive performance that can be conveniently fabricated, although many recently developed artificial muscles have shown excellent properties in one or two aspects. Herein, an artificial motor unit is developed based on gold&#8208;coated ultrathin liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) film. Subject to a voltage, Joule heating generated by the gold film increases the temperature of the LCE film underneath and causes it to contract. Due to the small thermal inertial and electrically controlling method of the ultrathin LCE structure, its cyclic actuation speed is fast and controllable. It is shown that under electrical stimulation, the actuation strain of the LCE&#8208;based motor unit reaches 45%, the strain rate reaches 750%/s, and the output power density is as high as 1360&#160;W&#160;kg&#8208;1. It is further demonstrated that the LCE&#8208;based motor unit behaves like an actuator, a brake, or a nonlinear spring on demand, analogous to most animal muscles. Finally, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, multiple highly dexterous artificial neuromuscular systems are demonstrated using the LCE&#8208;based motor unit.

         <title>Size&#8208;Induced Ferroelectricity in Antiferroelectric Oxide Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding size effects in antiferroelectrics provides important information for optimizing the performance of energy&#8208;storage devices at small scales. Direct experimental evidence for intrinsic size&#8208;driven scaling is demonstrated in lead&#8208;free antiferroelectric NaNbO3 membranes, in which an intriguing antiferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;ferroelectric transition occurs upon reducing thickness, leading a ferroelectric phase in thin membranes and coexistence of ferroelectric and antiferroelectric phases in thick membranes.








Abstract
Despite extensive studies on size effects in ferroelectrics, how structures and properties evolve in antiferroelectrics with reduced dimensions still remains elusive. Given the enormous potential of utilizing antiferroelectrics for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage applications, understanding their size effects will provide key information for optimizing device performances at small scales. Here, the fundamental intrinsic size dependence of antiferroelectricity in lead&#8208;free NaNbO3 membranes is investigated. Via a wide range of experimental and theoretical approaches, an intriguing antiferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;ferroelectric transition upon reducing membrane thickness is probed. This size effect leads to a ferroelectric single&#8208;phase below 40&#160;nm, as well as a mixed&#8208;phase state with ferroelectric and antiferroelectric orders coexisting above this critical thickness. Furthermore, it is shown that the antiferroelectric and ferroelectric orders are electrically switchable. First&#8208;principle calculations further reveal that the observed transition is driven by the structural distortion arising from the membrane surface. This work provides direct experimental evidence for intrinsic size&#8208;driven scaling in antiferroelectrics and demonstrates enormous potential of utilizing size effects to drive emergent properties in environmentally benign lead&#8208;free oxides with the membrane platform.

         <title>Recent Advances in Biodegradable Green Electronic Materials and Sensor Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
As environmental issues have become the dominant agenda worldwide, the necessity for more environmentally friendly electronics has recently emerged. Accordingly, biodegradable or nature&#8208;derived materials for green electronics have attracted increased interest. Initially, metal&#8208;green hybrid electronics were extensively studied. Although these materials are partially biodegradable, they have high utility owing to their metallic components. Subsequently, C&#8208;framed materials (such as graphite, cylindrical carbon nanomaterials, graphene, graphene oxide, laser&#8208;induced graphene) have been investigated. This has led to the adoption of various strategies for C&#8208;based materials, such as blending them with biodegradable materials. Moreover, various conductive polymers have been developed and researchers have studied their potential use in green electronics. Researchers have attempted to fabricate conductive polymer composites with high biodegradability by shortening the polymer chains. Furthermore, various physical, chemical, and biological sensors that are essential to modern society have been studied using biodegradable compounds. These recent advances in green electronics have paved the way toward their application in real life, providing a brighter future for society.

         <title>Manipulation of Heterogeneous Surface Electric Potential Promotes Osteogenesis by Strengthening RGD Peptide Binding and Cellular Mechanosensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The heterogeneity of extracellular matrix (ECM) topology, stiffness and architecture is a key factor modulating cellular behavior and osteogenesis. However, the effects of heterogeneous ECM electric potential at the micro&#8208; and nanoscale on cellular behavior and osteogenesis remain to be elucidated. Here, the heterogeneous distributions of surface electrical potential is established by incorporating ferroelectric BaTiO3 nanofibers (BTNF) into poly(vinylidene fluoridetrifluoroethylene) (P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)) matrix based on phase&#8208;field simulation and first&#8208;principles simulation. By optimizing the aspect ratios of BTNF fillers, the anisotropic distribution of surface potential on BTNF/P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) nanocomposite membranes can be achieved by strong spontaneous electric polarization of BTNF fillers. Our results indicate that heterogeneous surface potential distribution leads to a meshwork pattern of fibronectin (FN) aggregation, which increased FN&#8208;III7&#8208;10 (FN fragment) focal flexibility and anchor points as predicted by molecular dynamics simulation. Furthermore, integrin clustering, focal adhesion formation, cell spreading and adhesion were enhanced sequentially. Increased traction of actin fibers amplifies mechanotransduction by promoting nuclear translocation of YAP/Runx2, which enhances osteogenesis in vitro and bone regeneration in vivo. Our work thus provides fundamental insights into the biological effects of surface potential heterogeneity at the micro&#8208; and nanoscale on osteogenesis, and also develops a new strategy to optimize the performance of electroactive biomaterials for tissue regenerative therapies.

         <title>Advances in In vitro Models of Neuromuscular Junction: Focusing on Organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip, Organoids and Biohybrid Robotics</title>

Abstract
The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a peripheral synaptic connection between presynaptic motor neurons and postsynaptic skeletal muscle fibers that enables muscle contraction and voluntary motor movement. Many traumatic, neurodegenerative and neuroimmunological diseases are classically believed to mainly affect either the neuronal or the muscle side of the NMJ, and treatment options are lacking. Recent advances in novel techniques have helped develop in vitro physiological and pathophysiological models of the NMJ as well as enable precise control and evaluation of its functions. This paper reviews the recent developments in in vitro NMJ models with 2D or 3D cultures, from organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip and organoids to biohybrid robotics. We introduce related derivative techniques for functional analysis of the NMJ, such as the patch&#8208;clamp technique, microelectrode arrays, calcium imaging, and stimulus methods, particularly optogenetic&#8208;mediated light stimulation, microelectrode&#8208;mediated electrical stimulation, and biochemical stimulation. Finally, we summarize the applications of the in vitro NMJ models as disease models or for drug screening related to suitable neuromuscular diseases and discuss their future development trends and challenges.

Abstract
High&#8208;efficiency electromagnetic (EM) functional materials are the core building block of high&#8208;performance EM absorbers and devices, which are indispensable in various fields ranging from industrial manufacture to daily life, or even from national defense security to space exploration. Searching for high&#8208;efficiency EM functional materials and realizing high&#8208;performance EM devices remain to be great challenges. Herein, a simple solution&#8208;process is developed to rapidly grow gram&#8208;scale organic&#8208;inorganic (MAPbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) perovskite microcrystals. They exhibit excellent EM response in multi bands covering microwave, visible light, and X&#8208;ray. Among them, outstanding microwave absorption performance with multiple absorption bands can be achieved, and their intrinsic EM properties can be tuned by adjusting polar group. An ultra&#8208;wideband (UWB) bandpass filter with high suppression level of &#8208;71.8&#160;dB in the stopband in the GHz band, self&#8208;powered photodetectors with tunable broadband or narrowband photoresponse in visible light band, and a self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detector with high sensitivity of 3560 &#956;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 in X&#8208;ray band have been designed and realized by precisely regulating the physical features of perovskite and designing novel planar device structure. These findings open a door toward developing high&#8208;efficiency EM functional materials for realizing high&#8208;performance EM absorbers and devices.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Functional V2C MXene Assembly in Facilitating the Sulfur Evolution Kinetics and Li&#8208;Ion Sieving towards Practical Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>

Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are considered as one of the most promising candidates to achieve the energy density of 500&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1. However, the challenges of shuttle effect, sluggish sulfur conversion kinetics and lithium dendrite growth severely obstruct the practical implementation. Herein, multi&#8208;scale V2C MXene (VC) with spherical confinement structure is designed as a high&#8208;efficiency bi&#8208;functional promotor for the evolution of sulfur and lithium species in Li&#8211;S batteries. Combining the synchrotron X&#8208;ray three&#8208;dimensional nano&#8208;computed tomography (X&#8208;ray 3D nano&#8208;CT), small angle neutron scattering (SANS) techniques and first&#8208;principle calculation, we reveal that the activity of VC can be maximized by tuning the scale and the as&#8208;attained functions are conducted as follows: (i) The VC acts as the efficient lithium polysulfide (LiPS) scavenger due to the large number of active sites. (ii) The VC exhibits significantly improved electrocatalytic function for the Li2S nucleation and decomposition reaction kinetics owing to the scale effect. (iii) The VC can regulate the dynamic behavior of Li+ and thus stabilize the lithium plating/stripping effectively on account of the unique ion sieving effect. The synchronous optimization of cathode and anode endows the Li&#8211;S batteries with superior rate capability and cycling stability, e.g. the battery with a high sulfur loading of 8.1&#160;mg cm&#8211;2 enables a high areal capacity of 8.1&#160;mA h cm&#8211;2 at a low E/S ratio of 4&#160;&#956;L mgS&#8211;1.

         <title>Fill in the Blank: Transferrable Deep Learning Approaches to Recover Missing Physical Field Information</title>

Abstract
Solving materials engineering tasks is often hindered by limited information, such as in inverse problems with only boundary data information or design tasks with a simple objective but a vast search space. To address these challenges, we leverage multiple deep learning (DL) architectures to predict missing mechanical information given limited known data in part of the domain, and further characterize the composite geometries from the recovered mechanical fields for 2D and 3D complex microstructures. In 2D, we utilize a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) to complete partially masked field maps and predict the composite geometry with convolutional models with great accuracy and generality by making precise predictions on field data with mixed stress/strain components, hierarchical geometries, distinct materials properties and various types of microstructures including ill&#8208;posed inverse problems. In 3D, a Transformer&#8208;based architecture is implemented to predict complete 3D mechanical fields from input field snapshots. The model manifests excellent performance regardless of microstructural complexity and recovers the entire bulk field even from a single surface field image, allowing internal structural characterization from only boundary measurements. The whole frameworks provide efficient ways for analysis and design with incomplete information and allow the direct inverse translation from properties back to materials structures.

         <title>Centrifuge&#8208;free separation of solution&#8208;exfoliated 2D nanosheets via cross&#8208;flow filtration</title>

Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed graphene is a promising material for numerous high&#8208;volume applications including structural composites, batteries, sensors, and printed electronics. However, the polydisperse nature of graphene dispersions following liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation poses major manufacturing challenges, as incompletely exfoliated graphite flakes must be removed to achieve optimal properties and downstream performance. Incumbent separation schemes rely on centrifugation, which is highly energy&#8208;intensive and limits scalable manufacturing. Here, we introduce cross&#8208;flow filtration (CFF) as a centrifuge&#8208;free processing method that improves the throughput of graphene separation by two orders of magnitude. By tuning membrane pore sizes between microfiltration and ultrafiltration length scales, CFF can also be used for efficient recovery of solvents and stabilizing polymers. In this manner, life cycle assessment and techno&#8208;economic analysis reveal that CFF reduces greenhouse gas emissions, fossil energy usage, water consumption, and specific production costs of graphene manufacturing by 57%, 56%, 63%, and 72%, respectively. To confirm that CFF produces electronic&#8208;grade graphene, CFF&#8208;processed graphene nanosheets are formulated into printable inks, leading to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art thin&#8208;film conductivities exceeding 104 S m&#8722;1. This CFF methodology can likely be generalized to other van der Waals layered solids, thus enabling sustainable manufacturing of the diverse set of applications currently being pursued for two&#8208;dimensional materials.

Abstract
Defective and perfect sites naturally exist within electronic semiconductors, and considerable efforts to reduce defects to improve the performance of electronic devices, especially in hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic perovskites (ABX3), have been undertaken. Herein, foldable hole transporting materials (HTMs) were developed, and extend the wavefunctions of A&#8208;site cations of perovskite which as hybridized electronic states link the trap states (defective site) and valance band edge (perfect site) between the naturally defective and perfect sites of perovskite surface, finally converting the discrete trap states of perovskite as the continuous valance band to reduce the trap recombination. Tailoring the foldability of the HTMs tunes the wavefunctions between defective and perfect surface sites, allowing the power conversion efficiency of a small cell to reach 23.22% and that of a mini&#8208;module (6.5&#215;7 cm2, active area = 30.24 cm2) to get as high as 21.71% with a fill factor of 81%, the highest value reported for non&#8208;spiro&#8208;OMeTAD&#8208;based perovskite solar modules.

         <title>Conformable Ultrasound Patch for Cavitation Enhanced Transdermal Cosmeceutical Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Increased consumer interest in healthy&#8208;looking skin demands a safe and effective method to increase transdermal absorption of innovative therapeutic cosmeceuticals. However, permeation of small&#8208;molecule drugs is limited by the innate barrier function of the stratum corneum. Here, we report a conformable ultrasound patch (cUSP) that enhances transdermal transport of niacinamide by inducing intermediate&#8208;frequency sonophoresis in the fluid coupling medium between the patch and the skin. The cUSP consists of piezoelectric transducers embedded in a soft elastomer to create localized cavitation pockets (0.8 cm2, 1&#160;mm deep) over larger areas of conformal contact (20 cm2). Multiphysics simulation models, acoustic spectrum analysis and high&#8208;speed videography are used to characterize transducer deflection, acoustic pressure fields and resulting cavitation bubble dynamics in the coupling medium. The final system demonstrates a 26.2&#8208;fold enhancement in niacinamide transport in a porcine model in vitro with a 10&#8208;minute ultrasound application, demonstrating suitability of the device for short&#8208;exposure, large&#8208;area application of sonophoresis for patients and consumers suffering from skin conditions and premature skin aging.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Thin Lithium Silicide Interlayer for Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries with metallic lithium (LiBCC) anode and solid&#8208;electrolyte (SE) are under active development. However, an unstable SE/LiBCC interface due to electrochemical and mechanical instabilities hinders their operation. Herein, we demonstrate an ultra&#8208;thin nanoporous mixed ionic and electronic conductor (MIEC) interlayer (&#8764;3.25 &#956;m), which regulates LiBCC deposition and stripping, serving as a 3&#8208;dimensional (3D) scaffold for Li0 ad&#8208;atom formation, LiBCC nucleation, and long&#8208;range transport of ions and electrons at SE/LiBCC interface. Consisting of lithium silicide and carbon nanotubes, our MIEC interlayer is thermodynamically stable against LiBCC and highly lithiophilic. Moreover, its nanopores (&lt; 100 nm) confine the deposited LiBCC to the size regime where LiBCC exhibits &#8220;smaller is much softer&#8221; size&#8208;dependent plasticity governed by diffusive deformation mechanisms. The LiBCC thus remains soft enough not to mechanically penetrate SE in contact. Upon further plating, LiBCC grows in between the current collector and the MIEC interlayer, not directly contacting the SE. As a result, a full cell having Li3.75Si&#8208;CNT/LiBCC foil as an anode and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 as a cathode displays a high specific capacity of 207.8 mAh g&#8722;1, 92.0% initial Coulombic efficiency, 88.9% capacity retention after 200 cycles (Coulombic efficiency reaches 99.9% after tens of cycles), and excellent rate capability (76% at 5C).

         <title>Fabrication of 3D Oriented MOF Micropatterns with Anisotropic Fluorescent Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Micropatterning crystalline materials with oriented pores is necessary for the fabrication of devices with anisotropic properties. Crystalline and porous metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are ideal materials as their chemical and structural mutability enables precise tuning of functional properties for applications ranging from microelectronics to photonics. Herein, we design a patternable oriented MOF film: by using a photomask under X&#8208;ray exposure, the MOF film decomposes in the irradiated areas, remaining intact in the unexposed regions. The MOF film acts simultaneously as a resist and as functional porous material. While the heteroepitaxial growth from aligned Cu(OH)2 nanobelts is used to deposit oriented MOF films, the sensitivity to radiation is achieved by integrating a brominated dicarboxylic ligand (Br2BDC) into a copper&#8208;based MOF Cu2L2DABCO (L = BDC/Br2BDC). The lithographed samples act as a diffraction grating upon irradiation with a laser, thus confirming the quality of the extended MOF micropattern. Furthermore, the oriented MOF patterns are functionalized with fluorescent dyes. As a result, by rotating the polarization angle of the laser excitation, we demonstrate the alignment of the dye in the MOF. By controlling the functional response to light, this MOF patterning protocol could be used for the microfabrication of optical components for photonic devices.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Light Responsive Materials: Design Strategies and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Circularly polarized light (CPL) with the end of optical vector traveling along circumferential trajectory, shows left&#8208; and right&#8208;handedness, which transmits chiral information to materials via complicated CPL&#8208;matter interactions. Materials with circular dichroism respond to CPL illumination selectively with differential outputs that can be used to design novel photodetectors. Racemic or achiral compounds under CPL go through photodestruction, photoresolution and asymmetric synthesis pathways to generate enantiomeric bias and optical activity. By this strategy, helical polymers and chiral inorganic plasmonic nanostructures are synthesized directly, and their intramolecular folding and subsequent self&#8208;assembly are photo&#8208;modulable as well. In the aggregated state of self&#8208;assembly and liquid crystal phase, helical sense of the dynamic molecular packing is sensitive to enantiomeric bias brought by CPL, enabling the chiral amplification to supramolecular scale. In this review, we aim to systematically summarize and discuss the application&#8208;guided design strategies of CPL&#8208;responsive materials. Asymmetric synthesis, resolution and property&#8208;modulation of small organic compounds, polymers, inorganic nanoparticles, supramolecular assemblies and liquid crystals are highlighted based on the important developments during the last decades. Besides, applications of light&#8208;matter interactions including CPL detection and biomedical applications are also referred.

         <title>Electrochemical Healing of Fractured Metals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Repairing fractured metals to extend their useful lifetimes advances sustainability and mitigates greenhouse gas emissions from metal mining and processing. While high&#8208;temperature techniques have long been used to repair metals, the increasing ubiquity of digital manufacturing and &#8220;unweldable&#8221; alloys, as well as the integration of metals with polymers and electronics, call for radically different repair approaches. This paper presents a framework for effective room temperature repair of fractured metals using an area&#8208;selective nickel electrodeposition process we refer to as electrochemical healing. Based on a theoretical model that links geometric, mechanical, and electrochemical parameters to the recovery of tensile strength, this framework enables 100% recovery of tensile strength in nickel, low&#8208;carbon steel, two &#8220;unweldable&#8221; aluminum alloys, and a 3D&#8208;printed difficult&#8208;to&#8208;weld shellular structure while using a single common electrolyte chemistry. Through a distinct energy dissipation mechanism, this framework also enables up to 136% recovery of toughness in an aluminum alloy. To facilitate practical adoption, this work reveals scaling laws for the energetic, financial, and time costs of healing, and demonstrates the restoration of a functional level of strength in a fractured standard steel wrench. Empowered with this framework, room&#8208;temperature electrochemical healing could open exciting possibilities for the effective, scalable repair of metals in diverse applications.

         <title>Intramolecular&#8208;Catalyzed Vitrimers with White&#8208;Light Emission for Light&#8208;Emitting Diode Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Currently available encapsulating materials for white light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs) have certain limitations, such as the toxicity of phosphors and the non&#8208;recyclable nature of the encapsulating materials. In this study, relatively promising encapsulating materials with two significant advantages have been developed. First, chips can be directly encapsulated without phosphors using luminescent encapsulating materials. Second, the encapsulating materials can be reprocessed for recycling via intramolecular catalysis. To this end, blue&#8208;light emitting vitrimers (BEVs) have been prepared by the reaction of epoxy resin with amines and are found to exhibit strong blue emission and fast stress relaxation via internal catalysis. To obtain white&#8208;light emission, a well&#8208;designed yellow component, perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride, is grafted into the BEVs to generate white&#8208;light emitting vitrimers (WEVs). A rare synergy of blue and yellow light emission affords white&#8208;light emission. When the WEV is used as an encapsulating adhesive for 365&#8208;nm LED chips without inorganic phosphors, stable white light with CIE coordination (0.30, 0.32) is successfully achieved, indicating a promising future for WLED encapsulation.

         <title>Ultrahigh Performance, Serially Stackable, Breeze Driven Triboelectric Generator via Ambient Air Ionizing Channel</title>

Abstract
Currently, wind energy harvesting is in the limelight. However, with the existing electromagnetic wind generators, it is difficult to harvest multifariously&#8208;wasted breezes. To harvest energy from winds at a wide range of speeds, wind&#8208;driven triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have been studied. However, a critical limitation of general wind driven TENGs is that their power output is low. Therefore, an innovative strategy is necessary to generate high output power even from breeze. Herein, an approach to test a charge&#8208;polarization&#8208;based flutter&#8208;driven TENG (CPF&#8208;TENG) with ambient air ionizing channel (AAIC) is reported. Owing to AAIC, the device generates peak voltage and current outputs of 2000&#160;V and 4 A, respectively. Moreover, because the proposed CPF&#8208;TENG can generate power from breeze, it can be stacked in series to completely harvest wind energy. The stacked CPF&#8208;TENG is demonstrated to operate 3000 light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) and 12 hygrometers, separately, and produce hydrogen at a rate of 342.3&#160;&#956;L h&#8722;1 with the electrolysis cell.

         <title>Artificial Lipid Biomembranes for Full&#8208;Length SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Receptor</title>

Abstract
The angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as a functional receptor for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, is essential for preliminary assessment of potential hosts and treatment strategies. However, many studies are based on its truncated version but not full&#8208;length structure. Compared to the truncated version, a single&#8208;transmembrane helix presents in the full&#8208;length structure of ACE2, influencing its interaction and binding with SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Therefore, synthesis of the full&#8208;length ACE2 is an urgent requirement. Here, cell&#8208;free membrane protein synthesis systems (CFMPSs) are constructed for full&#8208;length membrane proteins. The transmembrane protein MscL is screened as a model among 10 membrane proteins based on their expression and solubility. Next, CFMPSs are constructed and optimized based on natural vesicles, vesicles with outer 4 membrane proteins removed or 2 chaperonins added, and 37 types of nanodiscs. They all increase membrane protein solubility to more than 50%. Finally, the full&#8208;length ACE2 of 21 species are successfully expressed with yields between 0.4&#8208;0.9&#160;mg/mL using the constructed CFMPS. Their functions show definite differences from the truncated versions, suggesting that the transmembrane region of ACE2 affects its structure and function. CFMPSs can be further extended to a broader range of membrane proteins, paving the way for their use in basic and applied research.

         <title>Exploring Optimal Water Splitting Bifunctional Alloy Catalyst by Pareto Active Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, optimization process of bifunctional water splitting catalyst by the interplay of experiment and Pareto active learning is done to explore high&#8208;performance catalyst. Out of 77946 possible data points, only 110 experimental data points are enough to effectively develop the model, and the discovered catalyst shows high performance both for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Design of bifunctional multimetallic alloy catalysts, which are one of the most promising candidates for water splitting, is a significant issue for the efficient production of renewable energy. Owing to large dimensions of the components and composition of multimetallic alloys, as well as the trade&#8208;off behavior in terms of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotentials for bifunctional catalysts, it is difficult to search for high&#8208;performance bifunctional catalysts with multimetallic alloys using conventional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error experiments. Here, an optimal bifunctional catalyst for water splitting is obtained by combining Pareto active learning and experiments, where 110 experimental data points out of 77946 possible points lead to effective model development. The as&#8208;obtained bifunctional catalysts for HER and OER exhibit high performance, which is revealed by model development using Pareto active learning; among the catalysts, an optimal catalyst (Pt0.15Pd0.30Ru0.30Cu0.25) exhibits a water splitting behavior of 1.56 V at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2. This study opens avenues for the efficient exploration of multimetallic alloys, which can be applied in multifunctional catalysts as well as in other applications.

This study provides &#8220;Mesenchymal&#160;stem&#160;cell&#160;Differentiation&#160;Prediction&#160;(MeD&#8208;P)&#8221;, a machine learning model for predicting hMSCs&#8211;biomaterial interaction. This enables comprehensive evaluation of biomaterials in MSC lineage fate regulation based on RNA&#8208;seq data. MeD&#8208;P is trained to be robust and accurate with large&#8208;scale public RNA&#8208;seq data after correcting for batch variances. It demonstrates much potential in facilitating biological performance optimization of biomaterials for tissue regenerative therapies.








Abstract
Current functional assessment of biomaterial&#8208;induced stem cell lineage fate in vitro mainly relies on biomarker&#8208;dependent methods with limited accuracy and efficiency. Here a &#8220;Mesenchymal stem cell Differentiation Prediction (MeD&#8208;P)&#8221; framework for biomaterial&#8208;induced cell lineage fate prediction is reported. MeD&#8208;P contains a cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific gene expression profile as a reference by integrating public RNA&#8208;seq data related to tri&#8208;lineage differentiation (osteogenesis, chondrogenesis, and adipogenesis) of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and a predictive model for classifying hMSCs differentiation lineages using the k&#8208;nearest neighbors (kNN) strategy. It is shown that MeD&#8208;P exhibits an overall accuracy of 90.63% on testing datasets, which is significantly higher than the model constructed based on canonical marker genes (80.21%). Moreover, evaluations of multiple biomaterials show that MeD&#8208;P provides accurate prediction of lineage fate on different types of biomaterials as early as the first week of hMSCs culture. In summary, it is demonstrated that MeD&#8208;P is an efficient and accurate strategy for stem cell lineage fate prediction and preliminary biomaterial functional evaluation.

         <title>Prominent Free Charges Tunneling Through Organic Interlayer of 2D Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We&#160;have constructed convertible RP (4AEPy)2PbI4 and DJ (4AEPy)PbI4 perovskite with one organic amine through a protonation control strategy. Organic cations in (4AEPy)PbI4 participate in band edge construction, making its exciton binding energy as low as 27.3 meV and producing more free carriers.








Abstract
The diversity of organic cations greatly enriches the species of 2D perovskites; traditional 2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (RP) and Dion&#8208;Jacobson (DJ) perovskites are synthesized by two different organic amines. Here, according to the difference in pKa values between conjugated acids of monoprotonated and biprotonated 4&#8208;(2&#8208;Aminoethyl)pyridine (4AEPy) ions, the 2D perovskites of RP (4AEPy)2PbI4 and DJ (4AEPy)PbI4 from same organic amine is reported, which can realize reversible transformation under the treatment of HI and NH3, respectively. The interaction of N&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;N hydrogen bond between adjacent organic molecules in (4AEPy)2PbI4 leads to the bending conformation of ethylamine groups, which results in a 2.4 &#197; reduction in layer spacing compared to typical phenylethylamine lead iodine ((PEA)2PbI4) 2D perovskite. Besides, the ethylamine groups of organic layers in (4AEPy)PbI4 are deeply inserted into octahedral cavities and directly participate in the construction of the conduction band minimum, which leads to a small exciton binding energy of 27.3 meV&#160;to&#160;generate&#160;free&#160;charges. The stronger coupling between the organic and inorganic layers and the minor exciton binding energy can promote the DJ phase to possess a more stable structure and better optoelectronic properties. Thus&#160;the (4AEPy)PbI4 device displays better light response and X&#8208;ray detection capability with a high sensitivity of 5627 &#181;C Gyair&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 and the lowest detectable dose rate of 20 nGyair s&#8208;1.

         <title>Multicolor and 3D Holography Generated by Inverse&#8208;Designed Single&#8208;Cell Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metasurface&#8208;generated multicolor and three&#8208;dimensional holography is demonstrated using single&#8208;cell metasurfaces. By using an inverse design based on gradient&#8208;descent optimization, multiple pieces of holographic information are encoded into a single&#8208;cell metasurface. The designed single&#8208;cell metasurfaces demonstrate the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art data capacity of a phase&#8208;only metasurface. The inverse&#8208;designed single&#8208;cell metasurfaces are experimentally realized using a high&#8208;throughput nanoimprint lithography fabrication method.








Abstract
Metasurface&#8208;generated holography has emerged as a promising route for fully reproducing vivid scenes by manipulating the optical properties of light using ultra&#8208;compact devices. However, achieving multiple holographic images using a single metasurface is still difficult due to the capacity limit of a single meta&#8208;atom. In this work, an inverse design method based on gradient&#8208;descent optimization is presented to encode multiple pieces of holographic information into a single metasurface. The proposed method allows the inverse design of single&#8208;cell metasurfaces without the need for complex meta&#8208;atom design strategies, facilitating high&#8208;throughput fabrication using broadband low&#8208;loss materials. By exploiting the proposed design method, both multiplane red&#8208;green&#8208;blue&#160;(RGB)&#160;color&#160;and three&#8208;dimensional&#160;(3D) holograms are designed and experimentally demonstrated. Multiplane RGB color holograms with nine distinct holograms are achieved, which demonstrate the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art data capacity of a phase&#8208;only metasurface. The first experimental demonstration of metasurface&#8208;generated 3D holograms with completely independent and distinct images in each plane is also presented. The current research findings provide a viable route for practical metasurface&#8208;generated holography by demonstrating the high&#8208;density holography produced by a single metasurface. It is expected to ultimately lead to optical storage, display, and full&#8208;color imaging&#160;applications.

         <title>Blocking Spatiotemporal Crosstalk between Subcellular Organelles for Enhancing Anticancer Therapy with Nanointercepters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organelle communication interception nanosystem is constructed with an amorphous Fe0 core and an ultrathin crystalline Fe3O4 shell (ACFeNPs). &#183;OH can efficiently generate along with the spatiotemporal trajectory of ACFeNPs within tumor cells. ACFeNPs transfer from lysosomes to the endoplasmic reticulum and block the crosstalk between them, sequentially trigger&#160;AMPK/mTOR, lysosomal damage, and the IRE1/JNK signaling pathway, ultimately inducing deep apoptosis of tumor cells that cannot be alleviated. All experiments confirm the enhanced tumor inhibition of the organelle communication spatiotemporal interception strategy and reveal the biomolecular mechanism.








Abstract
The spatiotemporal characterization of signaling crosstalk between subcellular organelles is crucial for the therapeutic effect of malignant tumors. Blocking interactive crosstalk in this fashion is significant but challenging. Herein, a communication interception strategy is reported, which blocks spatiotemporal crosstalk between subcellular organelles for cancer therapy with underlying molecular mechanisms. Briefly, amorphous&#8208;core@crystalline&#8208;shell Fe@Fe3O4 nanoparticles (ACFeNPs) are fabricated to specifically block the crosstalk between lysosomes and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by hydroxyl radicals generated along with their trajectory through heterogeneous Fenton reaction. ACFeNPs initially enter lysosomes and trigger autophagy, then continuous lysosomal damage blocks the generation of functional autolysosomes, which mediates ER&#8211;lysosome crosstalk, thus the autophagy is paralyzed. Thereafter, released ACFeNPs from lysosomes induce ER stress. Without the alleviation by autophagy, the ER&#8208;stress&#8208;associated apoptotic pathway is fully activated, resulting in a remarkable therapeutic effect. This strategy provides a wide venue for nanomedicine to exert biological advantages and confers new perspective for the design of novel anticancer drugs.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Stable FA&#8208;Based Quasi&#8208;2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskite Solar Cells by the Incorporation of &#946;&#8208;Fluorophenylethanamine Cations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new spacer cation of &#946;&#8208;fluorinated PEA (&#946;&#8208;&#8203;FPEA) is synthesized to enhance the efficiency and stability of FA&#8208;based 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The optimized 2D RP PSCs (&#12296;n&#12297;&#160;= 5) achieve a champion efficiency of 19.11% with largely improved stability by enhancing the quality and phase stability of the 2D RP perovskite film.








Abstract
2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (2D RP) perovskite, with attractive environmental and structural stability, has shown great application in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the relatively inferior photovoltaic efficiencies of 2D PSCs limit their further application. To address this issue, &#946;&#8208;&#8203;fluorophenylethanamine (&#946;&#8208;&#8203;FPEA) as a novel spacer cation is designed and employed to develop stable and efficient quasi&#8208;2D RP PSCs. The strong dipole moment of the &#946;&#8208;&#8203;FPEA enhances&#160;the interactions between the cations and [PbI6]4&#8722; octahedra, thus improving the charge dissociation of quasi&#8208;2D RP perovskite. Additionally, the introduction of the &#946;&#8208;&#8203;FPEA cation optimizes&#160;the energy level alignment, improves&#160;the crystallinity, stabilizes&#160;both the mixed phase and a&#8208;FAPbI3 phase of the quasi&#8208;2D RP perovskite film, prolongs&#160;the carrier diffusion length, increases&#160;the carrier lifetime and decreases&#160;the trap density. By incorporating the &#946;&#8208;&#8203;FPEA, the quasi&#8208;2D RP PSCs exhibit&#160;a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.77% (vs phenylethylammonium (PEA)&#8208;based quasi&#8208;2D RP PSCs of 12.81%) on PEDOT:PSS substrate and achieve&#160;a champion PCE of 19.11% on the PTAA substrate. It is worth noting that the unencapsulated &#946;&#8208;&#8203;FPEA&#8208;based quasi&#8208;2D RP PSCs exhibit&#160;considerably improved thermal and moisture stability. These findings provide an effective strategy for developing novel spacer cations for high&#8208;performance 2D RP PSCs.

         <title>Unveiling the Morphological and Physical Mechanism of Burn&#8208;in Loss Alleviation by Ternary Matrix Toward Stable and Efficient All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a high&#8208;efficiency ternary matrix platform for all&#8208;polymer solar cells, the operational stability enhancement strategy is proposed with carefully studied underlying reasons, in terms of morphology and photo&#8208;physics. Based on the &#8220;canceling&#8208;out&#8221; phenomenon, further ternary OPV blend design can be nourished by considering this principle during material combination, which can be useful in boosting both PCE and stability.








Abstract
All&#8208;polymer solar cells (All&#8208;PSCs) are considered the most promising candidate in achieving both efficient and stable organic photovoltaic devices, yet the field has rarely presented an in&#8208;depth understanding of corresponding device stability while efficiency is continuously boosted via the innovation of polymer acceptors. Herein, a ternary matrix is built for all&#8208;PSCs with optimized morphology, improved film ductility and importantly, boosted efficiency and better operational stability than its parental binary counterparts, as a platform to study the underlying mechanism. The target system PQM&#8208;Cl:PTQ10:PY&#8208;IT (0.8:0.2:1.2) exhibits an alleviated burn&#8208;in loss of morphology and efficiency under light soaking, which supports its promoted device lifetime. The comprehensive characterizations of fresh and light&#8208;soaked active layers lead to a clear illustration of opposite morphological and physical degradation direction of PQM&#8208;Cl and PTQ10, thus resulting in a delicate balance at the optimal ternary system. Specifically, the enlarging tendency of PQM&#8208;Cl and shrinking preference of PTQ10 in terms of phase separation leads to a stable morphology in their mixing phase; the hole transfer kinetics of PQM&#8208;Cl:PY&#8208;IT host is stabilized by incorporating PTQ10. This work succeeds in reaching a deep insight into all&#8208;PSC's stability promotion by a rational ternary design, which booms the prospect of gaining high&#8208;performance all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Prioritizing Hetero&#8208;Metallic Interfaces via Thermodynamics Inertia and Kinetics Zincophilia Metrics for Tough Zn&#8208;Based Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
What is a good hetero&#8208;metallic interface and how to design it? Targeting at prioritizing zincophilic sites for high&#8208;efficiency Zn anode, a theory&#8208;to&#8208;application metric is established via various hetero metals and synthetic solvents. The elaborate &#8220;thermodynamics inertia and kinetics metalphilia&#8221; metrics for the rational selection and design of the artificial interfaces can benchmark the success of other metal&#8208;based batteries.








Abstract
Poor thermodynamic stability and sluggish electrochemical kinetics of metallic Zn anode in aqueous solution greatly hamper its practical application. To solve such problems, to date, various zincophilic surface modification strategies are developed, which can facilitate reversible Zn plating/stripping behavior. However, there is still a lack of systematic and fundamental understanding regarding the metrics of thermodynamics inertia and kinetics zincophilia in selecting zincophilic sites. Herein, hetero&#8208;metallic interfaces are prioritized for the first time via optimizing different hetero metals (Fe, Co, Ni, Sn, Bi, Cu, Zn, etc.) and synthetic solvents (ethanol, ethylene glycol, n&#8208;propanol, etc.). Specifically, both theoretical simulations and experimental results suggest that this Bi@Zn interface can exhibit high efficiency owing to the thermodynamics inertia and kinetics zincophilia. A best practice for prioritizing zincophilic sites in a more practical metric is also proposed. As a proof of concept, the Bi@Zn anode delivers ultralow overpotential of &#8776;55&#160;mV at a high rate of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and stable cycle life over 4700 cycles. The elaborated &#8220;thermodynamics inertia and kinetics metalphilia&#8221; metrics for hetero&#8208;metallic interfaces can benchmark the success of other metal&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>Gelatin&#8208;Based Ingestible Impedance Sensor to Evaluate Gastrointestinal Epithelial Barriers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thin film electrode arrays are integrated with gelatin&#8208;based substrates to fabricate ingestible impedance sensing arrays. These devices are evaluated on their ability to monitor gastrointestinal barrier integrity, an indicator of several gut&#8208;related diseases. In vitro, theoretical, and ex vivo techniques are presented to test the viability of this sensing approach.








Abstract
Low&#8208;profile and transient ingestible electronic capsules for diagnostics and therapeutics can replace widely used yet invasive procedures such as endoscopies. Several gastrointestinal diseases such as reflux disease, Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and eosinophilic esophagitis result in increased intercellular dilation in epithelial barriers. Currently, the primary method of diagnosing and monitoring epithelial barrier integrity is via endoscopic tissue biopsies followed by histological imaging. Here, a gelatin&#8208;based ingestible electronic capsule that can monitor epithelial barriers via electrochemical impedance measurements is proposed. Toward this end, material&#8208;specific transfer printing methodologies to manufacture soft&#8208;gelatin&#8208;based electronics, an in vitro synthetic disease model to validate impedance&#8208;based sensing, and tests of capsules using ex vivo using porcine esophageal tissue are described. The technologies described herein can advance next generation of oral diagnostic devices that reduce invasiveness and improve convenience for patients.

         <title>Generation of 13.9&#8208;mJ Terahertz Radiation from Lithium Niobate Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Extremely strong&#8208;field terahertz (THz) radiation in free space has compelling applications in nonequilibrium condensed matter state regulation, all&#8208;optical THz electron acceleration and manipulation, THz biological effects, etc. However, these practical applications are constrained by the absence of high&#8208;intensity, high&#8208;efficiency, high&#8208;beam&#8208;quality, and stable solid&#8208;state THz light sources. Here, the generation of single&#8208;cycle 13.9&#8208;mJ extreme THz pulses from cryogenically cooled lithium niobate crystals and a 1.2% energy conversion efficiency from 800&#160;nm to THz were demonstrated experimentally using the tilted pulse&#8208;front technique driven by a home&#8208;built 30&#8208;fs, 1.2&#8208;Joule Ti:sapphire laser amplifier. The focused peak electric field strength was estimated to be 7.5&#160;MV/cm. We also produced a record of 1.1&#8208;mJ THz single&#8208;pulse energy at a 450 mJ pump at room temperature and observed that the self&#8208;phase modulation of the optical pump could induce THz saturation behavior from the crystals in the substantially nonlinear pump regime. This study lays the foundation for the generation of sub&#8208;Joule THz radiation from lithium niobate crystals and will inspire more innovations in extreme THz science and applications.

         <title>Scalable Fabrication of Dual&#8208;Function Fabric for Zero&#8208;Energy Thermal Environmental Management through Multiband, Synergistic, and Asymmetric Optical Modulations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;function fabric with both radiative cooling and solar heating functions on two sides of the fabric is developed. The dual&#8208;function fabric demonstrates high adaption to the dynamic environment and superior performance for zero&#8208;energy&#8208;input temperature regulation. As a roof coating, the dual&#8208;function fabric can achieve &#8776;22.4&#160;MJ m&#8722;2 y&#8722;1 energy saving, corresponding to &#8776;173.7 billion kg global CO2 emission reduction.








Abstract
Solar heating and radiative cooling techniques have been proposed for passive space thermal management to reduce the global energy burden. However, the currently used single&#8208;function envelope/coating materials can only achieve static temperature regulation, presenting limited energy savings and poor adaption to dynamic environments. In this study, a sandwich&#8208;structured fabric, composed of vertical graphene, graphene glass fiber fabric, and polyacrylonitrile nanofibers is developed, with heating and cooling functions integrated through multiband, synergistic, (solar spectrum and mid&#8208;infrared ranges) and asymmetric optical modulations on two sides of the fabric. The dual&#8208;function fabric demonstrates high adaption to the dynamic environment and superior performance in a zero&#8208;energy&#8208;input temperature regulation. Furthermore, it demonstrates &#8776;15.5 and &#8776;31.1&#160;MJ m&#8722;2 y&#8722;1 higher annual energy savings compared to those of their cooling&#8208;only and heating&#8208;only counterparts, corresponding to &#8776;173.7 MT reduction in the global CO2 emission. The fabric exhibits high scalability for batch manufacturing with commercially abundant raw materials and facile technologies, providing a favorable guarantee of its mass production and use.

A 3D&#8208;printed Zn anode with layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer bottom&#8208;up attenuating Ag nanoparticles (3DP&#8208;BU@Zn) establishes dual&#8208;gradient electron/ion fluxes and realizes an extremely small voltage hysteresis and a superior lifespan over 630 h. This unique dual&#8208;gradient strategy sheds light on the roadmap for the next&#8208;generation safe and durable Zn&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
3D porous Zn&#8208;metal anodes have aroused widespread interest&#160;for Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Nevertheless, the notorious &#8220;top&#8208;growth&#8221; dendrites caused by the intrinsic top&#8208;concentrated ions and randomly distributed electrons may ultimately trigger a cell failure. Herein, an electron/ion&#8208;flux dual&#8208;gradient 3D porous Zn anode is reported&#160;for dendrite&#8208;free ZIBs by adopting 3D printing technology. The 3D&#8208;printed Zn anode with layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer bottom&#8208;up attenuating Ag nanoparticles (3DP&#8208;BU@Zn) establishes dual&#8208;gradient electron/ion fluxes, i.e., an internal bottom&#8208;up gradient electron flux created by bottom&#8208;rich conductive Ag nanoparticles, and a gradient ion flux resulting from zincophilic Ag nanoparticles which pump ions toward the bottom. Meanwhile, the 3D&#8208;printing&#8208;enabled hierarchical porous structure and continuously conducting network endow unimpeded electron transfer and ion diffusion among the electrode, dominating a bottom&#8208;preferential Zn deposition behavior. As a result, the 3DP&#8208;BU@Zn symmetrical cell affords highly reversible Zn plating/stripping with an extremely small voltage hysteresis of 17.7&#160;mV and a superior lifespan over 630 h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8722;2. Meanwhile, the 3DP&#8208;BU@Zn//VO2 full cell exhibits remarkable cyclic stability over 500 cycles. This unique dual&#8208;gradient strategy sheds light on the roadmap for the next&#8208;generation safe and durable Zn&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Multivalent Nanobody Conjugate with Rigid, Reactive Oxygen Species Scavenging Scaffold for Multi&#8208;Target Therapy of Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multivalent nanobody conjugate PNBIL incorporating a rigid, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging scaffold PDDA and engineered nanobody NBIL, whose third complementary&#8208;determining region is grafted by A&#946; 33&#8211;42 and C&#8208;terminus is fused with human IL&#8208;1&#946; 163&#8211;171, realizes the multi&#8208;target therapy of Alzheimer's disease through effectively suppressing A&#946; aggregation, promoting A&#946; plaque clearance, and eliminating ROS in the AD microenvironment.








Abstract
Efficient therapeutic strategies that concurrently target both A&#946; aggregation and oxidative stress in the Alzheimer's&#160;disease&#160;(AD)&#160;microenvironment emerge as a cutting&#8208;edge tool to combat the intricate pathogenesis of AD. Here, a multivalent nanobody conjugate with rigid, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging scaffold is developed to achieve simultaneous A&#946; amyloidogenesis mitigation, ROS elimination, and A&#946; plaque clearance. Grafting A&#946; segment (33&#8208;GLMVGGVVIA&#8208;42) into the third complementary&#8208;determining region of a parent nanobody generates an engineered nanobody NB that can recognize A&#946; and inhibit its aggregation through homotypic interactions. NB is further genetically modified with a fragment of human interleukin&#8208;1&#946; (163&#8208;VQGEESNDK&#8208;171), so that the obtained fusion nanobody NBIL can also facilitate the A&#946; clearance by microglia. Linking NBIL covalently onto a rigid, ROS scavenging scaffold poly(deca&#8208;4,6&#8208;diynedioic acid) (PDDA) creates the multivalent nanobody conjugate PNBIL, which not only boosts the binding affinity between NBIL and A&#946; aggregates for nearly 100 times but also possesses a long&#8208;term capability of oxidative stress alleviation, inflammation reduction, and neuron protection. PNBIL has significantly attenuated symptoms on two AD mouse models through amyloidogenesis inhibition and AD microenvironment modulation, validating that the multivalent nanobody conjugate design based on combinatory nanobody and molecular engineering is a promising approach of multi&#8208;target therapeutic strategies.

         <title>Interlayer&#8208;Spacing Engineering of Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Single Crystal for High&#8208;Performance X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new A&#8208;site cation aminoguanidinium (AG) with all&#8208;NH2 terminals is designed to shorten the interlayer spacing of A3Bi2I9&#8208;type HPs by forming more and stronger N&#63743;H&#183;&#183;&#183;I hydrogen bonds and large AG3Bi2I9 single crystals (SCs) are prepared. The interlayer spacing shortened AG3Bi2I9 SC shows a large mobility&#8208;lifetime product, high sensitivity and low detection limit in X&#8208;ray detection, high spatial resolution in X&#8208;ray imaging.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;free A3Bi2I9&#8208;type perovskites are demonstrated as a class of promising semiconductors for high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray detection due to their high bulk resistivity and strong X&#8208;ray absorption, as well as reduced ion migration. However, due to their long interlamellar distance along their c&#8208;axis, their limited carrier transport along the vertical direction is a bottleneck for their detection sensitivity. Herein, a new A&#8208;site cation of aminoguanidinium (AG) with all&#8208;NH2 terminals is designed to shorten the interlayer spacing by forming more and stronger N&#63743;H&#183;&#183;&#183;I hydrogen bonds. The prepared large AG3Bi2I9 single crystals (SCs) render shorter interlamellar distance for a larger mobility&#8208;lifetime product of 7.94&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1, which is three times higher than the value measured on the best MA3Bi2I9 SC (2.87 &#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1). Therefore, the X&#8208;ray detectors fabricated on the AG3Bi2I9 SC exhibit high sensitivity of 5791 uC&#160;Gy&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2, a low detection limit of 2.6&#160;nGy s&#8722;1, and a short response time of 690&#160;&#181;s, all of which are far better than those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MA3Bi2I9 SC detectors. The combination of high sensitivity and high stability enables astonishingly high spatial resolution (8.7 lp&#160;mm&#8722;1) X&#8208;ray imaging. This work will facilitate the development of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance lead&#8208;free X&#8208;ray detectors.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nanosecond 2D Perovskite Scintillators by Dielectric Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational design strategy to shorten the scintillation decay time by maximizing the dielectric difference between organic amines and [PbBr6]2&#8722; octahedral emitters in 2D perovskites is shown. Benzimidazole (BM) with conjugated structure inserts between [PbBr6]2&#8722; layers, shortening the emitting decay time into sub&#8208;nanosecond region. The sub&#8208;nanosecond BM2PbBr4 scintillator exhibits excellent performance in high energy photons and particles detection.








Abstract
Perovskite materials have demonstrated great potential for ultrafast scintillators with high light yield. However, the decay time of perovskite still cannot be further minimized into sub&#8208;nanosecond region, while sub&#8208;nanosecond scintillators are highly demanded in various radiation detection, including high speed X&#8208;ray imaging, time&#8208;of&#8208;flight based tomography or particle discrimination, and timing resolution measurement in synchrotron radiation facilities, etc. Here, a rational design strategy is showed to shorten the scintillation decay time, by maximizing the dielectric difference between organic amines and Pb&#8208;Br octahedral emitters in 2D organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHP). Benzimidazole (BM) with low dielectric constant inserted between [PbBr6]2&#8722; layers, resulting in a surprisingly large exciton binding energy (360.3 &#177; 4.8 meV) of 2D OIHP BM2PbBr4. The emitting decay time is shortened as 0.97&#160;ns, which is smallest among all the perovskite materials. Moreover, the light yield is 3190&#160;photons&#160;MeV&#8722;1, which is greatly higher than conventional ultrafast scintillator BaF2 (1500&#160;photons&#160;MeV&#8722;1). The rare combination of ultrafast decay time and considerable light yield renders BM2PbBr4 excellent performance in &#947;&#8208;ray, neutron, &#945;&#8208;particle detection, and the best theoretical coincidence time resolution of 65.1&#160;ps, which is only half of the reference sample LYSO (141.3&#160;ps).

&lt;p&gt;A rational design strategy to shorten the scintillation decay time by maximizing the dielectric difference between organic amines and [PbBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; octahedral emitters in 2D perovskites is shown. Benzimidazole (BM) with conjugated structure inserts between [PbBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; layers, shortening the emitting decay time into sub-nanosecond region. The sub-nanosecond BM&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; scintillator exhibits excellent performance in high energy photons and particles detection.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perovskite materials have demonstrated great potential for ultrafast scintillators with high light yield. However, the decay time of perovskite still cannot be further minimized into sub-nanosecond region, while sub-nanosecond scintillators are highly demanded in various radiation detection, including high speed X-ray imaging, time-of-flight based tomography or particle discrimination, and timing resolution measurement in synchrotron radiation facilities, etc. Here, a rational design strategy is showed to shorten the scintillation decay time, by maximizing the dielectric difference between organic amines and Pb-Br octahedral emitters in 2D organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHP). Benzimidazole (BM) with low dielectric constant inserted between [PbBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; layers, resulting in a surprisingly large exciton binding energy (360.3 &#177; 4.8 meV) of 2D OIHP BM&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The emitting decay time is shortened as 0.97&#160;ns, which is smallest among all the perovskite materials. Moreover, the light yield is 3190&#160;photons&#160;MeV&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is greatly higher than conventional ultrafast scintillator BaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (1500&#160;photons&#160;MeV&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). The rare combination of ultrafast decay time and considerable light yield renders BM&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; excellent performance in &#947;-ray, neutron, &#945;-particle detection, and the best theoretical coincidence time resolution of 65.1&#160;ps, which is only half of the reference sample LYSO (141.3&#160;ps).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>300&#8208;Times&#8208;Increased Diffusive Skyrmion Dynamics and Effective Pinning Reduction by Periodic Field Excitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally activated Brownian motion is key for skyrmion devices in non&#8208;conventional computing. A drastic increase in skyrmion diffusion and enhanced skyrmion stability is reported due to periodic magnetic field excitations. Adjusting the strength of the oscillations, the pinning landscape can be tailored continuously and switch from a pinning&#8208;dominated to a free&#8208;like motion regime.








Abstract
Thermally induced skyrmion dynamics, as well as skyrmion pinning effects, in thin films have attracted significant interest. While pinning poses challenges in deterministic skyrmion devices and slows down skyrmion diffusion, for applications in non&#8208;conventional computing, both pinning of an appropriate strength and skyrmion diffusion speed are key. Here, periodic field excitations are employed to realize an increase of the skyrmion diffusion by more than two orders of magnitude. Amplifying the excitation, a drastic reduction of the effective skyrmion pinning, is reported, and a transition from pinning&#8208;dominated diffusive hopping to dynamics approaching free diffusion is observed. By tailoring the field oscillation frequency and amplitude, a continuous tuning of the effective pinning and skyrmion dynamics is demonstrated, which is a key asset and enabler for non&#8208;conventional computing applications. It is found that the periodic excitations additionally allow stabilization of skyrmions at different sizes for field values that are inaccessible in static systems, opening up new approaches to ultrafast skyrmion motion by transiently exciting moving skyrmions.

         <title>Tough Hydrogel Electrolytes for Anti&#8208;Freezing Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;nonsolvency and &#8220;salting&#8208;out&#8221; are synergistically utilized to create a flexible electrolyte with superior strength, freezing tolerance, high mass transport (10&#215; lower overpotential over semi&#8208;closed&#8208;pore&#160;counterparts), and stable cycling, benefitting from the suppressed dendritic growth and side reactions (30&#8201;000 cycles), which pushes the limit of flexible batteries toward higher stability in harsh environments.








Abstract
As the soaring demand for energy storage continues to grow, batteries that can cope with extreme conditions are highly desired. Yet, existing battery materials are limited by weak mechanical properties and freeze&#8208;vulnerability, prohibiting safe energy storage in devices that are exposed to low temperature and unusual mechanical impacts. Herein, a fabrication method harnessing the synergistic effect of co&#8208;nonsolvency and &#8220;salting&#8208;out&#8221; that can produce poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogel electrolytes with unique open&#8208;cell porous structures, composed of strongly aggregated polymer chains, and containing disrupted hydrogen bonds among free water molecules, is introduced. The hydrogel electrolyte simultaneously combines high strength (tensile strength 15.6&#160;MPa), freeze&#8208;tolerance (&lt;&#160;&#8722;77 &#176;C), high mass transport (10&#215; lower overpotential), and dendrite and parasitic reactions suppression for stable performance (30&#8201;000 cycles). The high generality of this method is further demonstrated with poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) and poly(N&#8208;tertbutylacrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;acrylamide) hydrogels. This work takes a further step toward flexible battery development for harsh environments.

         <title>Young Exosome Bio&#8208;Nanoparticles Restore Aging&#8208;Impaired Tendon Stem/Progenitor Cell Function and Reparative Capacity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exosome&#160;bio&#8208;nanoparticles from stem cells of human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED&#8208;Exos) inhibit senescent phenotypes of aged tendon stem/progenitor cells and rescue their tenogenic differentiation capacity by inhibiting histone methylation and nuclear factor&#8208;&#954;B. Local delivery of SHED&#8208;Exos&#8208;loaded microspheres exhibits excellent anti&#8208;aging effects, including reducing senescent cells and heterotopic&#160;ossification, and thereby restores endogenous tendon regeneration capacity in aged rats.








Abstract
Aging impairs tendon stem/progenitor&#160;cell function and tendon homeostasis, however, effective treatments for aging&#8208;induced tendon diseases are lacking. Exosomes are naturally derived nanoparticles that contain bioactive molecules, and therefore, have attracted great interest in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. In this study, it is shown that young exosomes secreted by stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED&#8208;Exos) possess abundant anti&#8208;aging signals. These young bio&#8208;nanoparticles can alleviate the aging phenotypes of aged tendon stem/progenitor cells (AT&#8208;SCs) and maintain their tenogenic capacity. Mechanistically, SHED&#8208;Exos modulate histone methylation and inhibit nuclear factor&#8208;&#954;B to reverse AT&#8208;SC aging. In a naturally aging mouse model, systemic administration of SHED&#8208;Exo bio&#8208;nanoparticles retards tendon degeneration. Interestingly, local delivery of SHED&#8208;Exos&#8208;loaded microspheres confers anti&#8208;aging phenotypes, including reduced senescent cells and decreased ectopic bone formation, thereby functionally and structurally rescuing endogenous tendon regeneration and repair capacity in aged rats. Overall, SHED&#8208;Exos, as natural bioactive nanoparticles, have promising translational and therapeutic potential for aging&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>High Energy Harvesting Performances Silicone Elastomer via Filling Soft Dielectric with Stretching Deformability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Dielectric elastomer generators (DEGs) with high generated energy density and high conversion efficiency are of great interest. Among several dielectric elastomers (DEs), silicone elastomer filled with ceramic fillers have been extensively studied for their high elasticity, insulation and permittivity. However, the stretched breakdown strength (Ebs) of such composites decreases significantly under large strain, thus sharply reduces its energy harvesting performances. In this study, a polar rubber&#8208;based dielectric (GNBR) is synthetized and creatively used as &#8220;soft filler&#8221; for silicone elastomer. Benefiting from the deformability under stretching and its inherent strong interface bonding with silicone elastomer, this soft filler effectively avoids the formation of weak interface under large strain and reduces the local field strength of interface area. As expected, the composite filled with soft filler (GNBR/PMVS) shows enhanced Ebs of 2.8 times that of composite with traditional hard filler (TiO2/PMVS) under equibiaxial strain of 200%. As a result, GNBR/PMVS composite exhibits maximum energy density of 130.5 mJ/g with up&#8208;to&#8208;date highest power conversion efficiency of reported DEG (44.5%). The findings will provide new insights in the rational design of DE composites characterized by high stretched breakdown strength for advanced energy harvesting system.

Abstract
Optical biosensors based on plasmonic sensing schemes combine high sensitivity and selectivity with label&#8208;free detection. However, the use of bulky optical components is still hampering the possibility of obtaining miniaturized systems required for analysis in real settings. Here, we demonstrate a fully miniaturized optical biosensor prototype based on plasmonic detection that enables fast and multiplex sensing of analytes with high&#8208; and low&#8208;molecular weight (80&#8239;000 and 582 Dalton) as quality and safety parameters for milk: a protein (lactoferrin) and an antibiotic (streptomycin). The optical sensor is based on the smart integration of (i) miniatuirized organic optoelectronic devices used as light&#8208;emitting and &#8208;sensing elements and (ii) a functionalized nanostructured plasmonic grating for highly sensitive and specific localized surface plasmon resonance (SPR) detection. The sensor provides quantitative and linear response reaching a limit of detection of 10&#8722;4 refractive index units once it is calibrated by standard solutions. Analyte&#8208;specific and rapid (15 minute&#8208;long) immunoassay&#8208;based detection was demonstrated for both targets. By using a custom algorithm based on principal&#8208;component analysis, a linear dose&#8208;response curve was constructed which correlated with a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 3.7&#160;&#956;g/mL for lactoferrin, thus assensing the miniaturized optical biosensor well&#8208;alined with the chosen reference benchtop SPR method.

However, the use of bulky optical components is still hampering the possibility of obtaining miniaturized systems required for analysis in real settings. Here, we demonstrate a fully miniaturized optical biosensor prototype based on plasmonic detection that enables fast and multiplex sensing of analytes with high- and low-molecular weight (80&#8239;000 and 582 Dalton) as quality and safety parameters for milk: a protein (lactoferrin) and an antibiotic (streptomycin).

         <title>Heterologous Assembly of Pleomorphic Bacterial Microcompartment Shell Architectures Spanning the Nano&#8208; to Microscale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Many bacteria use protein&#8208;based organelles known as bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) to organize and sequester sequential enzymatic reactions. Regardless of their specialized metabolic function, all BMCs are delimited by a shell made of multiple structurally redundant, yet functionally diverse, hexameric (BMC&#8208;H), pseudohexameric/trimeric (BMC&#8208;T), or pentameric (BMC&#8208;P) shell protein paralogs. When expressed without their native cargo, shell proteins have been shown to self&#8208;assemble into 2D sheets, open&#8208;ended nanotubes and closed shells of &#8764;40&#160;nm diameter that are being developed as scaffolds and nanocontainers for applications in biotechnology. Here by leveraging a strategy for affinity&#8208;based purification we demonstrate that a wide range of empty synthetic shells, many differing in end cap structures, can be derived from a glycyl radical enzyme&#8208;associated microcompartment (GRM). The range of pleomorphic shells observed, which span &#8764;2 orders of magnitude in size from &#8764;25&#160;nm to &#8764;1.8&#160;&#956;m, reveals the remarkable plasticity of BMC&#8208;based biomaterials. In addition, we observe new capped nanotube and nanocone morphologies that are consistent with a multi&#8208;component geometric model in which architectural principles are shared among asymmetric carbon, viral protein, and BMC&#8208;based structures.

         <title>Complex Structures Made Simple &#8211; Continuous Flow Production of Core Cross&#8208;Linked Polymeric Micelles for Paclitaxel Pro&#8208;Drug&#8208;Delivery</title>

Abstract
Translating innovative nanomaterials to medical products requires efficient manufacturing techniques that enable large&#8208;scale high&#8208;throughput synthesis and high reproducibility. Drug carriers in medicine embrace a complex subset of tasks calling for multi&#8208;functionality. Here, we report the synthesis of pro&#8208;drug&#8208;loaded core cross&#8208;linked polymeric micelles (CCPMs) in a continuous flow process, which combines the commonly separated steps of micelle formation, core cross&#8208;linking, functionalization, and purification into a single process. Redox&#8208;responsive CCPMs are formed from thiol&#8208;reactive polypept(o)ides of polysarcosine&#8208;block&#8208;poly(S&#8208;ethylsulfonyl&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine) and functional cross&#8208;linkers based on dihydrolipoic acid hydrazide for pH&#8208;dependent release of paclitaxel. The precisely controlled microfluidic self&#8208;assembly and purification process allows the production of spherical micelles (Dh = 35&#160;nm) with low polydispersity values (PDI&lt;0.1) while avoiding toxic organic solvents and additives with unfavorable safety profiles. Self&#8208;assembly and cross&#8208;linking via slit interdigital micromixers produce 350&#8211;700&#160;mg of CCPMs/h per single system, while purification by online tangential flow filtration successfully removes impurities (unimer &#8804; 0.5%). The formed paclitaxel&#8208;loaded CCPMs possess the desired pH&#8208;responsive release profile, display stable drug encapsulation, an improved toxicity profile compared to Abraxane, and therapeutic efficiency in the B16F1&#8208;xenotransplanted zebrafish model. The combination of reactive polymers, functional cross&#8208;linkers, and microfluidics enables the continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of therapeutically active CCPMs in a single process.

         <title>Confined ionic liquid&#8208;mediated cation diffusion through layered membranes for high&#8208;performance osmotic energy conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ion&#8208;selective membranes act as the core components in osmotic energy harvesting, but remain the deficiency such as low ion selectivity and tendency to swell. Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanofluidic membranes as competitive candidates are still subjected to limited mass transport brought by insufficient wetting and poor stability in water. Here, we report ionic liquid&#8208;infused graphene oxide (GO@IL) membrane with ultrafast ion transport ability and reveal how confined ionic liquid mediates selective cation diffusion. The infusion of ionic liquids endows the 2D membrane with excellent mechanical strength, anti&#8208;swelling properties, and good stability in aqueous electrolytes. Importantly, immiscible ionic liquids also provide a medium, allowing partial dehydration for ultrafast ion transport. Through molecular dynamics simulation and finite element modeling, we prove that GO nanosheets induce ionic liquids to rearrange, bringing in additional space charges, which can be coupled with GO synergistically. By mixing 0.5/0.01&#160;M NaCl solution, the power density can achieve a record value of approximately 6.7&#160;W m&#8722;2, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;art GO&#8208;based membranes. This work opens up a new route for boosting nanofluidic energy conversion because of the diversity of the ILs and 2D materials.

         <title>Multifunctional Conjugated Molecular Additives for Highly Efficient Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Further optimization of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is impeded by crystal deformation caused by residual stress and defect formation with subsequent non&#8208;radiative recombination. Molecular additives for defect passivation have been widely studied; however, the majority have insulating properties that hinder charge injection and transport. Herein, we report highly efficient green&#8208;emitting PeLEDs by introducing semiconducting molecular additives (Fl&#8208;OEGA and Fl&#8208;C8A). Transmission electron microscopy shows that conjugated additives exist primarily at the grain boundaries of perovskite, and Kelvin probe force microscopy confirms that the variation in contact potential difference between grain boundaries and perovskite crystal domains is significantly reduced. The residual tensile stress is reduced by 13% and the activation energy for ion migration increases in the Fl&#8208;OEGA&#8208;treated perovskite film, compared to those of the film without additives. Compared to insulating 2,2&#8242;&#8208;(ethylenedioxy)diethylamine (EDEA), the introduction of semiconducting additives prevents a significant reduction in the charge transport capability. Furthermore, the PeLEDs with Fl&#8208;OEGA show a negligible shift in the turn&#8208;on voltage and a significantly smaller decrease in the current density with increasing Fl&#8208;OEGA compared to the devices with EDEA. Finally, the 3D CsPbBr3&#8211;PeLEDs show the highest external quantum efficiency of 21.3% by the incorporation of semiconducting Fl&#8208;OEGA as a new multifunctional additive.

         <title>Emergent Ferroelectric Switching Behavior from Polar Vortex Lattice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Topologically protected polar textures have provided a rich playground for the exploration of novel, emergent phenomena. Recent discoveries indicate that ferroelectric vortices and skyrmions not only host properties markedly different from traditional ferroelectrics, but also that these properties can be harnessed for unique memory devices. Using a combination of capacitor&#8208;based capacitance measurements and computational models, we demonstrate that polar vortices in dielectric&#8208;ferroelectric&#8208;dielectric trilayers exhibit classical ferroelectric bi&#8208;stability together with the existence of low&#8208;field metastable polarization states. This behavior is directly tied to the in&#8208;plane vortex ordering, and we show that it can be used as a new method of non&#8208;destructive readout&#8208;out of the poled state.

Using a combination of capacitor-based capacitance measurements and computational models, we demonstrate that polar vortices in dielectric-ferroelectric-dielectric trilayers exhibit classical ferroelectric bi-stability together with the existence of low-field metastable polarization states. This behavior is directly tied to the in-plane vortex ordering, and we show that it can be used as a new method of non-destructive readout-out of the poled state.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Heterosynaptic MoS2 Memtransistors Emulating Biological Neuromodulation for Energy&#8208;Efficient Neuromorphic Electronics</title>

Abstract
Heterosynaptic neuromodulation is a key enabler for energy&#8208;efficient and high&#8208;level biological neural processing. However, such manifold synaptic modulation cannot be emulated using conventional memristors and synaptic transistors. Thus, herein, we report a three&#8208;terminal heterosynaptic memtransistor using an intentional&#8208;defect&#8208;generated molybdenum disulfide channel. Particularly, the defect&#8208;mediated space&#8208;charge&#8208;limited conduction in the ultrathin channel results in memristive switching characteristics between the source and drain terminals, which are further modulated using a gate terminal according to the gate&#8208;tuned filling of trap states. The device acts as an artificial synapse controlled by sub&#8208;fJ impulses from both the source and gate terminals, consuming lower energy than its biological counterpart. In particular, electrostatic gate modulation, corresponding to biological neuromodulation, additionally regulates the dynamic range and tuning rate of the synaptic weight, independent of the programming (source) impulses. Notably, this heterosynaptic modulation not only improves the learning accuracy and efficiency but also reduces energy consumption in the pattern recognition. Thus, our study presents a new route leading toward the realization of highly networked and energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic electronics.

         <title>Trans&#8208;Reflective Structural Color Filters Assisting Multifunctional&#8208;Integrated Semitransparent Photovoltaic Window</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Multifunction&#8208;integrated semitransparent organic photovoltaic cells (STOPVs), with high power generation, colorful transmittance/reflectance, excellent UV protection, and thermal insulation, are fully in line with the concept of architectural aesthetics and photoprotection characteristics for building&#8208;integrated photovoltaic&#8208;window. For the indelible rainbow color photovoltaic window, one crucial issue is to realize the integration of these photons&#8208; and photoelectric&#8208;related multifunction. Herein, dynamic transmissive and reflective structural color controllable filters, with asymmetrical metal&#8208;insulator&#8208;metal configurations (20&#160;nm&#8208;Ag&#8208;HATCN&#8208;30&#160;nm&#8208;Ag) through machine learning, were deliberately designed for colorful STOPV devices. This endows the resultant integrated devices with &#8764;5% enhanced power conversion efficiency than the bare&#8208;STOPVs, gifted UV (300&#8208;400&#160;nm) blocking rates as high as 93.5, 94.1, 90.2, and 94.5%, as well as a superior IR (700&#8208;1400&#160;nm) rejection approaching 100% for transparent purple&#8208;, blue&#8208;, green&#8208; and red&#8208;STOPV cells, respectively. Most importantly, benefiting from the photonic recycling effect beyond microcavity resonance wavelength, a reported quantum utilization efficiency as high as 80%, was first presented for the transparent&#8208;green&#8208;STOPVs with an ultra&#8208;narrow bandgap of 1.2&#160;eV. These asymmetrical Febry&#8208;P&#233;rot transmissive and reflective structural color filters can also be extended to silicon&#8208; and perovskite&#8208;based optoelectric devices and make it possible to integrate additional target optical functions for multi&#8208;purpose optoelectric devices.

&lt;p&gt;Multifunction-integrated semitransparent organic photovoltaic cells (STOPVs), with high power generation, colorful transmittance/reflectance, excellent UV protection, and thermal insulation, are fully in line with the concept of architectural aesthetics and photoprotection characteristics for building-integrated photovoltaic-window.

         <title>Vertical Array of Graphite Oxide Liquid Crystal by Microwire Shearing for Highly Thermally Conductive Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Excellent through&#8208;plane thermally conductive composites are highly demanded for efficient heat dissipation. Giant sheets have large crystalline domain and significantly reduce interface phonon scattering, making them promising to build highly thermally conductive composites. However, realizing vertical orientation of giant sheets remains challenging due to their enormous mass and huge hydrodynamic drag force. Here, we achieve highly vertically ordered liquid crystals of giant graphite oxide (more than 100&#160;&#956;m in lateral dimension) by microwire shearing, which endows the composite with a recorded through&#8208;plane thermal conductivity of 94&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1. Microscale shearing fields induced by vertical motion of microwires conquer huge hydrodynamic energy barrier and vertically reorient giant sheets. The resulting liquid crystals exhibit extremely retarded relaxation and impart large&#8208;scale vertical array with bidirectional ordering degree as high as 0.82. The graphite array&#8208;based composites demonstrate an ultrahigh thermal enhancement efficiency of over 35 times per unit volume. Furthermore, the composites improve cooling efficiency by 93% for thermal management tests compared to commercial thermal interface materials. Our work offers a novel methodology to precisely manipulate the orientation of giant particles and promote large&#8208;scale fabrication of vertical array with advanced functionalities.

         <title>Robust Thermal Neutron Detection by LiInP2Se6 Bulk Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Direct neutron detection based on semiconductor crystals holds promise to transform current neutron detector technologies and further boosts their widespread applications. It is, however, long impeded by the dearth of suitable materials in the form of sizeable bulk crystals. Here, we have developed high&#8208;quality centimeter&#8208;sized LiInP2Se6 single crystals using the Bridgman method and systematically investigated their structure and property characteristics. The prototype detectors fabricated from the crystals demonstrate an energy resolution of 53.7% in response to &#945;&#8208;particles generated from an 241Am source and robust, well&#8208;defined response spectra to thermal neutrons that exhibit no polarization or degradation effects under prolonged neutron/&#947;&#8208;ray irradiation. We have also identified the primary mechanisms of Se&#8208;vacancy and InLi antisite defects in the carrier trapping process. Such insights are critical for further enhancing the energy resolution of LiInP2Se6 bulk crystals towards the intrinsic level (&#8764;8.6% as indicated by our chemical vapor transport&#8208;grown thin crystals). These results pave the way for practically adopting LiInP2Se6 single crystals in new&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state neutron detectors.

         <title>Bridging Synthesis and Controllable Doping of Monolayer 4&#8208;Inch Length Transition&#8208;Metal Dichalcogenides Single Crystals with High Electron Mobility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Epitaxial growth and controllable doping of wafer&#8208;scale atomically thin semiconductor single crystals are two central tasks to tackle the scaling challenge of transistors. Despite considerable efforts have been devoted, addressing such crucial issues simultaneously under two&#8208;dimensional (2D) confinement is yet to be realized. Here we design an ingenious strategy to synthesize record&#8208;breaking 4&#8208;inch length Fe&#8208;doped transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) single crystals on industry&#8208;compatible c&#8208;plane sapphire without special miscut angle. Atomically thin transistors with high electron mobility (&#8764;146 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and remarkable on/off current ratio (&#8764;109) are fabricated based on 4&#8208;inch length Fe&#8208;MoS2 single crystals, due to the ultralow contact resistance (&#8764;489 &#937; &#956;m). In&#8208;depth characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of Fe significantly decreases the formation energy of parallel steps on sapphire surfaces and contributes to the edge&#8208;nucleation of unidirectional alignment TMDCs domains (&gt;99%). This work represents a substantial leap in terms of bridging synthesis and doping of wafer&#8208;scale 2D semiconductor single crystals, which should promote the further device downscaling and extension of Moore's law.

         <title>A Nonswelling Hydrogel with Regenerable High Wet Tissue Adhesion for Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonswelling hydrogels with regenerable high wet tissue adhesion are fabricated. Subsequently, neural microelectrode arrays and rapid&#8208;response strain sensors are integrated into the hydrogel to fabricate bifunctional tissue&#8208;interface bioelectronics. Additionally, these bioelectronics possess excellent electrical properties. Electrocardiogram&#160;(ECG), electromyography (EMG), and tissue movement information are accurately recorded by the bioelectronics, and tissue fatigue is successfully monitored.








Abstract
Reducing the swelling of tissue&#8208;adhesive hydrogels is crucial for maintaining stable tissue adhesion and inhibiting tissue inflammation. However, reported strategies for reducing swelling always result in a simultaneous decrease in the tissue adhesive strength of the hydrogel. Furthermore, once the covalent bonds break in the currently reported hydrogels, they cannot be rebuilt, and the hydrogel loses its tissue adhesive ability. In this work, a nonswelling hydrogel (named as &#8220;PAACP&#8221;) possessing regenerable high tissue adhesion is synthesized by copolymerizing and crosslinking poly(vinyl butyral) with acrylic acid, gelatin, and chitosan&#8208;grafted N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine. The tissue adhesive strength of the obtained PAACP reaches 211.4&#160;kPa, which is approximately ten times higher than that of the reported nonswelling hydrogels, and the hydrogel can be reused for multiple cycles. The as&#8208;prepared hydrogel shows great potential in soft bioelectronics, as muscle fatigue is successfully monitored via the electrode array and strain sensor integrated on PAACP substrates. The success of these bioelectronics offers potential applicability in the long&#8208;term diagnosis of muscle&#8208;related health conditions and prosthetic manipulations.

         <title>Intrinsically Stretchable Polymer Semiconductors with Good Ductility and High Charge Mobility through Reducing the Central Symmetry of the Conjugated Backbone Units</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New intrinsically stretchable polymer semiconductors with good ductility and high charge mobility are designed and investigated by incorporating non&#8208;centrosymmetric spiro&#8208;fluorene units into the backbones of the DPP&#8208;based conjugated polymers. Compared with the parent conjugated polymer, the terpolymers show low moduli and good semiconducting performance both under mechanical deformation and against cyclic strains.








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable polymer semiconductors are highly demanding for flexible electronics. However, it still remains challenging to achieve synergy between intrinsic stretchability and charge transport property properly for polymer semiconductors. In this paper, terpolymers are reported as intrinsically stretchable polymeric semiconductors with good ductility and high charge mobility simultaneously by incorporation of non&#8208;centrosymmetric spiro[cycloalkane&#8208;1,9&#8242;&#8208;fluorene] (spiro&#8208;fluorene) units into the backbone of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based conjugated polymers. The results reveal that these terpolymers show obviously high crack onset strains and their tensile moduli are remarkably reduced, by comparing with the parent DPP&#8208;based conjugated polymer without spiro&#8208;fluorene units. They exhibit simultaneously high charge mobilities (&gt;1.0 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) at 100% strain and even after repeated stretching and releasing cycles for 500 times under 50% strain. The terpolymer P2, in which cyclopropane is linked to the spiro&#8208;fluorene unit, is among the best reported intrinsically stretchable polymer semiconductors with record mobility up to 3.1 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 at even 150% strain and 1.4 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 after repeated stretching and releasing cycles for 1000 times.

         <title>Dynamic Reconstitution Between Copper Single Atoms and Clusters for Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalytic C&#63743;N coupling between carbon dioxide and nitrate emerges to meet comprehensive demands of carbon footprint closing, valorization of waste, and sustainable manufacture of urea. Herein, the urea synthesis catalyzed by Cu1&#8211;CeO2 is reported. The dynamic reversible reconstitution of the catalyst configuration is monitored using operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectra and the Cu4 clusters are real active sites for electrocatalytic urea synthesis. Transform of clusters back to single&#8208;atom configurations occurs when the applied potential is switched to an open&#8208;circuit potential, endowing the catalyst with superior structural and electrochemical stabilities.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic C&#63743;N coupling between carbon dioxide and nitrate has emerged to meet the comprehensive demands of carbon footprint closing, valorization of waste, and sustainable manufacture of urea. However, the identification of catalytic active sites and the design of efficient electrocatalysts remain a challenge. Herein, the synthesis of urea catalyzed by copper single atoms decorated on a CeO2 support (denoted as Cu1&#8211;CeO2) is reported. The catalyst exhibits an average urea yield rate of 52.84&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 gcat.&#8722;1 at &#8722;1.6&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectra demonstrate the reconstitution of copper single atoms (Cu1) to clusters (Cu4) during electrolysis. These electrochemically reconstituted Cu4 clusters are real active sites for electrocatalytic urea synthesis. Favorable C&#63743;N coupling reactions and urea formation on Cu4 are validated using operando synchrotron&#8208;radiation Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Dynamic and reversible transformations of clusters to single&#8208;atom configurations occur when the applied potential is switched to an open&#8208;circuit potential, endowing the catalyst with superior structural and electrochemical stabilities.

         <title>Tetramode Metamaterials as Phonon Polarizers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An experimental realization and application of a tetramode material are presented. According to Cauchy elasticity, four out of the six deformation modes of such materials are considered &#8220;easy&#8221;. A property that can be exploited as a compact broadband polarizer for transverse phonons. This is demonstrated experimentally with a 3D metamaterial structure fabricated using direct laser writing.








Abstract
In classical Cauchy elasticity, 3D materials exhibit six eigenmodes of deformation. Following the 1995 work of Milton and Cherkaev, extremal elastic materials can be classified by the number of eigenmodes, N, out of these six that are &#8220;easy&#8221;. Using Greek number words, this leads to hexamode (N&#160;= 6), pentamode (N&#160;= 5), tetramode (N&#160;= 4), trimode (N&#160;= 3), dimode (N&#160;= 2), and monomode (N&#160;= 1) materials. While hexamode materials are unstable in all regards, the possibility of pentamode metamaterials (&#8220;meta&#8208;fluids&#8221;) has attracted considerable attention throughout the last decade. Here, inspired by the 2021 theoretical work of Wei, Liu, and Hu, microstructured 3D polymer&#8208;based tetramode metamaterials are designed and characterized by numerical band&#8208;structure calculations, fabricated by laser printing, characterized by ultrasound experiments, and compared to the theoretical ideal. An application in terms of a compact and broadband polarizer for acoustical phonons at ultrasound frequencies is demonstrated.

         <title>Additive Manufacturing of Carbon Using Commodity Polypropylene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a robust manufacturing method to prepare structured carbon materials using low&#8208;cost commodity plastic as precursors, paired with simple and scalable processes. The crack generation upon diffusion&#8208;controlled sulfonation crosslinking provides an important mechanism to ensure full crosslinking of 3D printed PP parts, enabling their efficient conversion to mechanically robust carbon products.








Abstract
Carbon materials are essential to the development of modern society with indispensable use in various applications, such as energy storage and high&#8208;performance composites. Despite great progress, on&#8208;demand carbon manufacturing with control over 3D&#160;macroscopic configuration is still an intractable challenge, hindering their direct use in many areas requiring structured materials and products. This work introduces a simple and scalable method to generate complex, large&#8208;scale carbon structures using easily accessible materials and technologies. 3D&#8208;printed, commercial polypropylene (PP) parts can be thermally stabilized through cracking&#8208;facilitated diffusion and crosslinking. The newly elucidated mechanism from this work allows thick PP parts to yield carbonaceous products with complex structures through a subsequent pyrolysis step. The approach for enabling PP&#8208;to&#8208;carbon conversion has consistent product yield and controlled dimensional shrinkage. Under optimized processing conditions, these PP&#8208;derived carbons exhibit robust mechanical properties and excellent joule heating performance, demonstrated by their versatile use as heating elements. Furthermore, this process can be extended to recycled PP, enabling the conversion of waste plastic materials to value&#8208;added products. This work provides an innovative approach to create structured carbon materials with direct access to complex geometry, which can be transformative to, and broadly benefit, many important technological applications.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon materials are essential to the development of modern society with indispensable use in various applications, such as energy storage and high-performance composites. Despite great progress, on-demand carbon manufacturing with control over 3D&#160;macroscopic configuration is still an intractable challenge, hindering their direct use in many areas requiring structured materials and products. This work introduces a simple and scalable method to generate complex, large-scale carbon structures using easily accessible materials and technologies. 3D-printed, commercial polypropylene (PP) parts can be thermally stabilized through cracking-facilitated diffusion and crosslinking. The newly elucidated mechanism from this work allows thick PP parts to yield carbonaceous products with complex structures through a subsequent pyrolysis step. The approach for enabling PP-to-carbon conversion has consistent product yield and controlled dimensional shrinkage. Under optimized processing conditions, these PP-derived carbons exhibit robust mechanical properties and excellent joule heating performance, demonstrated by their versatile use as heating elements. Furthermore, this process can be extended to recycled PP, enabling the conversion of waste plastic materials to value-added products. This work provides an innovative approach to create structured carbon materials with direct access to complex geometry, which can be transformative to, and broadly benefit, many important technological applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unveiling the Intrinsic Structure and Intragrain Defects of Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Perovskites by Ultralow Dose Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transmission&#8208;electron&#8208;microscopy&#8208;based characterization techniques are expected to play a significant role in revealing the structural, compositional, and electronic properties of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite materials and optoelectronic devices. However, perovskites are unstable and highly sensitive to electron beam radiation. This paper has outlined key guidelines for imaging the intrinsic structure of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite materials.








Abstract
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is a powerful tool for unveiling the structural, compositional, and electronic properties of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) at the atomic to micrometer length scales. However, the structural and compositional instability of OIHPs under electron beam radiation results in misunderstandings of the microscopic structure&#8211;property&#8211;performance relationship in OIHP devices. Here, ultralow dose TEM is utilized to identify the mechanism of the electron&#8208;beam&#8208;induced changes in OHIPs and clarify the cumulative electron dose thresholds (critical dose) of different commercially interesting state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OIHPs, including methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3), formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3), FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3, FA0.15Cs0.85PbI3, and MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3. The critical dose is related to the composition of the OIHPs, with FA0.15Cs0.85PbI3 having the highest critical dose of &#8776;84 e &#197;&#8722;2 and FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3 having the lowest critical dose of &#8776;4.2 e &#197;&#8722;2. The electron beam irradiation results in the formation of a superstructure with ordered I and FA vacancies along &lt;110&gt;c, as identified from the three major crystal axes in cubic FAPbI3, &lt;100&gt;c, &lt;110&gt;c, and &lt;111&gt;c. The intragrain planar defects in FAPbI3 are stable, while an obvious modification is observed in FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3 under continuous electron beam exposure. This information can serve as a guide for ensuring a reliable understanding of the microstructure of OIHP optoelectronic devices by TEM.

         <title>Heteroepitaxy of 2D CuCr2Te4 with Robust Room&#8208;temperature Ferromagnetism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a heteroepitaxial growth strategy of ferromagnetic CuCr2Te4 nanosheets on mica and Cr2Te3, with thickness&#8208;dependent ferromagnetism of CuCr2Te4 nanosheets on mica and an enhanced robust ferromagnetism with TC up to 340&#160;K via interfacial charge transfer in lattice&#8208;matched CuCr2Te4/Cr2Te3 heterostructure. The thickness&#8208;dependent room&#8208;temperature 2D ferromagnetic heterostructures are promising for constructing functional spintronic devices.








Abstract
Magnetic materials in 2D have attracted widespread attention for their intriguing magnetic properties. 2D magnetic heterostructures can provide unprecedented opportunities for exploring fundamental physics and novel spintronic devices. Here, the heteroepitaxial growth of ferromagnetic CuCr2Te4 nanosheets is reported on Cr2Te3 and mica by chemical vapor deposition. Magneto&#8208;optical Kerr effect measurements reveal the thickness&#8208;dependent ferromagnetism of CuCr2Te4 nanosheets on mica, where a decrease of Curie temperature (TC) from 320 to 260&#160;K and an enhancement of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy with reducing thickness are observed. Moreover, lattice&#8208;matched heteroepitaxial ultrathin CuCr2Te4 on Cr2Te3 exhibits an enhanced robust ferromagnetism with TC up to 340&#160;K due to the interfacial charge transfer. Stripe&#8208;type magnetic domains and single magnetic domain are discovered in this heterostructure with different thicknesses. The work provides a way to construct robust room&#8208;temperature 2D magnetic heterostructures for functional spintronic devices.

         <title>Thermo&#8208;pH&#8208;Sensitive Polymer Conjugated Glucose Oxidase for Tumor&#8208;Selective Starvation&#8208;Oxidation&#8208;Immune Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermo&#8208;pH&#8208;sensitive polymer&#8211;glucose oxidase conjugate shows significant improvements in cellular uptake, intracellular hydrogen peroxide generation, cytotoxicity, and tumor cell spheroid penetration under acidic conditions. The conjugate penetrates into the whole tumor&#160;tissue but hardly diffuses into the normal tissues, resulting in the eradication of the tumors in mice without perceivable side effects and inducing a robust antitumor immunity .








Abstract
Protein drugs are increasingly used as therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. However, their inherent drawbacks, such as poor stability, low cell membrane and tissue permeability, lack of tumor selectivity, and severe side effects, limit their wide applications in cancer therapy. Herein, screening of a thermo&#8208;pH&#8208;sensitive polymer&#8211;glucose oxidase conjugate that can controllably self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles with improved stability is reported. The size, surface charge, and bioactivity of the conjugate can be tuned by adjustment of the solution temperature and pH. The cellular uptake, intracellular hydrogen peroxide generation, and tumor cell spheroid penetration of the conjugate are greatly enhanced under the acidic tumor microenvironment, leading to increased cytotoxicity to tumor cells. Upon a single intratumoural injection, the conjugate penetrates into the whole tumor tissue but hardly diffuses into the normal tissues, resulting in the eradication of the tumors in mice without perceivable side effects. Simultaneously, the conjugate induces a robust antitumor immunity to efficiently inhibit the growth of distant tumors, especially in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. These findings provide a novel and general strategy to make multifunctional protein&#8208;polymer conjugates with responsiveness to the acidic tumor microenvironment for selective tumor therapy.

         <title>Novel Organic Superbase Dopants for Ultraefficient n&#8208;Doping of Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Doping is a powerful technique for engineering the electrical properties of organic semiconductors (OSCs), yet efficient n&#8208;doping of OSCs remains a central challenge. Herein, we report the discovery of two organic superbase dopants, namely P2&#8208;t&#8208;Bu and P4&#8208;t&#8208;Bu as ultra&#8208;efficient n&#8208;dopants for OSCs. Typical n&#8208;type semiconductors such as N2200 and PC61BM are shown to experience significant increase of conductivity upon doping by the two dopants. In particular, the optimized electrical conductivity of P2&#8208;t&#8208;Bu&#8208;doped PC61BM reaches a record&#8208;high value of 2.64 S/cm. The polaron generation efficiency of P2&#8208;t&#8208;Bu&#8208;doped in PC61BM is found to be over 35%, which is 2&#8211;3 times higher than that of benchmark n&#8208;dopant N&#8208;DMBI. In addition, a deprotonation&#8208;initiated, nucleophilic&#8208;attack&#8208;based n&#8208;doping mechanism is proposed for the organic superbases, which involves the deprotonation of OSC molecules, the nucleophilic attack of the resulting carbanions on the OSC's &#960;&#8208;bonds, and the subsequent n&#8208;doping through single electron transfer process between the anionized and neutral OSCs. Our work highlights organic superbases as promising n&#8208;dopants for OSCs and opens up opportunities to explore and develop highly efficient n&#8208;dopants.

         <title>Butterfly&#8208;Inspired Tri&#8208;State Photonic Crystal Composite Film for Multilevel Information Encryption and Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the hindwing structure of the butterfly, a new kind of tri&#8208;state photonic crystal (PC) film is constructed by sophisticated anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials based on both chemical (luminescent materials) and physical structure units (3D&#160;PC structure), which supports three distinct optical states and makes counterfeiting almost impossible. Such system will be a promising next&#8208;generation anti&#8208;counterfeiting solution.








Abstract
Counterfeiting is a worldwide issue and has long troubled legitimate businesses, while nowadays anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials and technology are still insufficient to combat the escalating counterfeit behaviors. Inspired by hindwing structure of Troides magellanus, a new kind of anti&#8208;counterfeiting material taking advantage of both physical and chemical structures to display multiple optical states is prepared. The chemical units (luminescent lanthanide) are blended with physical units (monodispersed colloidal particles) and mediating molecules, which are then assembled into a photonic crystal structure at room temperature in less than 10&#160;s through a new assembly technique called molecule&#8208;mediated shear&#8208;induced assembly technique (MSAT). The as&#8208;prepared photonic crystal films feature three unique optical states, each displaying structural, fluorescent, and phosphorescent color under different lighting conditions, which integrates colors from both physical and chemical origins. Furthermore, by incorporating different luminescent materials into different parts of the photonic crystal pattern, a high&#8208;level information encryption system is designed to be capable of carrying three distinct types of information. Thanks to this powerful tool of MSAT, it is now possible to assemble different&#8208;sized, even irregular non&#8208;spherical units with monodispersed spherical units into high&#8208;quality photonic crystal films, which provides easy access to incorporating new features into photonic crystal systems.

         <title>Enantioselective Au&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Thia[5]&#8208; and Thia[6]helicenes and Their Transformation into Bowl&#8208;shaped Pleiadenes</title>

         <dc:description>
The highly enantioselective synthesis of three families of thiahelicenes is described, their inversion barriers determined, and their photochemical characterization reported. Upon acidic treatment of thia[6]helicenes these structures are wrapped into bowl&#8208;shaped pleiadenes with complete helical&#8208;to&#8208;point chirality transfer.








Abstract
A series of helically shaped benzo[b]chryseno[4,3&#8208;d]thiophenes, naphtho[1,2&#8208;b]phenanthro[4,3&#8208;d]thiophenes, and chryseno[3,4&#8208;b]naphtho[1,2&#8208;d]thiophenes is synthesized via a highly enantioselective Au&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular alkyne hydroarylation reaction. The inversion barriers of the structures obtained are determined both theoretically and experimentally, and their chiroptical properties are reported. Preliminary studies on the post&#8208;synthetic functionalization of these thiahelicenes and their transformation into azahelicenes are also presented. In addition, a straightforward one&#8208;step protocol is developed, which wraps the initially obtained chryseno[3,4&#8208;b]naphtho[1,2&#8208;d]thiophenes into bowl&#8208;shaped pleiadene derivatives without erosion of the enantiopurity. The number of structurally related products that are obtained with high enantioselectivity enables the establishment of comprehensive correlations between the structure and conformational stability or (chir)optical properties.

         <title>Terminal Atom&#8208;Controlled Etching of 2D&#8208;TMDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The terminal atom&#8208;controlled etching of 2D&#8208;TMDs through defects introduced by laser irradiationand subsequent thermal etching in a controlled etching atmosphere are presented. The forward etched hole arrays are etched in Ar/H2 atmosphere, the hexagonal hole arrays are etched in pure Ar atmosphere, and the reverse etched hole arrays are etched in Ar/sulfur vapor atmosphere.








Abstract
The controlled etching of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (2D&#8208;TMDs) is critical to understanding the growth mechanisms of 2D materials and patterning 2D materials but remains a major comprehensive challenge. Here, a rational strategy to control the terminal atoms of 2D&#8208;TMDs etched holes is reported. Using laser irradiation combined with an improved anisotropic thermal etching process under a determined atmosphere, terminal atom&#8208;controlled etched hole arrays are created on 2D&#8208;TMDs. By adjusting the gas atmosphere during the thermal etching stage, triangular etched hole arrays terminated by the tungsten&#160;zigzag&#160;(W&#8208;ZZ) edge (in an Ar/H2 atmosphere), hexagonal etched hole arrays terminated alternately by the W&#8208;ZZ edge and sulfur&#160;(selenium)&#160;zigzag&#160;(S&#8208;ZZ or&#160;Se&#8208;ZZ) edge (in a pure Ar atmosphere), and triangular etched hole arrays terminated by the S&#8208;ZZ (Se&#8208;ZZ) edge (in an Ar/sulfur [selenium] vapor atmosphere) can be obtained. Density functional theory reveals the forming energy of different edges and the different activities of metal atoms and chalcogenide atoms under different atmospheres, which determine the terminal atoms of the holes. This work may enhance the understanding of the etching and growth of 2D&#8208;TMDs. The 2D&#8208;TMDs hole arrays constructed by this work may have important applications in catalysis, nonlinear optics, spintronics, and large&#8208;scale integrated circuits.

         <title>Boosting the Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy Performance of 2D Layered Double Hydroxide Nanosheet&#8208;Based Sonosensitizers Via Crystalline&#8208;to&#8208;Amorphous Phase Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystalline&#8208;to&#8208;amorphous phase transformation is proposed as a simple but powerful strategy to engineer ultrathin 2D CoW&#8208;LDH and NiW&#8208;LDH nanosheets as high&#8208;efficiency sonosensitizers for sonodynamic cancer therapy, thus achieving cell death and tumor eradication under US irradiation.








Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has been a promising therapeutic modality for cancer because of its superior advantages compared with other therapeutic strategies. However, the current sonosensitizers used for SDT normally exhibit low activity for ultrasound (US)&#8208;induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Herein, the crystalline&#8208;to&#8208;amorphous phase transformation is reported as a simple but powerful strategy to engineer ultrathin 2D CoW&#8208;LDH and NiW&#8208;LDH nanosheets as highly efficient sonosensitizers for SDT. The phase transformation of CoW&#8208;LDH and NiW&#8208;LDH nanosheets from polycrystalline to amorphous ones is achieved through a simple acid etching treatment. Importantly, compared with the polycrystalline one, the amorphous CoW&#8208;LDH (a&#8208;CoW&#8208;LDH) nanosheets possess higher ROS generation activity under US irradiation, which is &#8776;17 times of the commercial TiO2 sonosensitizer. The results suggest that the enhanced performance of ultrathin a&#8208;CoW&#8208;LDH nanosheets for US&#8208;induced ROS generation may be attributed to the phase transformation&#8208;induced defect generation and electronic structure changes. After polyethylene glycol modification, the a&#8208;CoW&#8208;LDH nanosheets can serve as a high&#8208;efficiency sonosensitizer for SDT to achieve cell death in vitro and tumor eradication in vivo under US irradiation.

         <title>Inhibited Crack Development by Compressive Strain in Perovskite Solar Cells with Improved Mechanical Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanical behavior of perovskite films during thermal cycling is investigated and the mechanisms that guide the formation and development of microscopic cracks are revealed. An effective strategy to restrain the generation of cracks in perovskite films is further proposed by constructing a benign compressive strain perovskite film, leading to durable perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites are promising as next&#8208;generation photovoltaic materials, but stability issues are still a huge obstacle to their commercialization. Here, the formation and evolution of cracks in perovskite films during thermal cycling, which affect their mechanical stability, are investigated. Compressive strain is employed to suppress cracks and delamination by in situ formed polymers with low elastic modulus during crystal growth. The resultant devices pass the thermal&#8208;cycling qualification (IEC61215:2016), retaining 95% of the initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) and compressive strain after 230 cycles. Meanwhile, the p&#8211;i&#8211;n devices deliver PCEs of 23.91% (0.0805 cm2) and 23.27% (1 cm2). The findings shed light on strain engineering with respect to their evolution, which enables mechanically stable perovskite solar cells.

The resultant devices pass the thermal-cycling qualification (IEC61215:2016), retaining 95% of the initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) and compressive strain after 230 cycles. Meanwhile, the p&#8211;i&#8211;n devices deliver PCEs of 23.91% (0.0805 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and 23.27% (1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The findings shed light on strain engineering with respect to their evolution, which enables mechanically stable perovskite solar cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Fluorinated Covalent Organic Framework with Accelerated Oxygen Transfer Nanochannels for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fluorinated covalent organic framework (COF) engineering strategy is used to develop high&#8208;performance air cathodes for rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries. The fluorinated COF nanopores are employed as an oxygen high&#8208;speed channel, which are then assembled into aerophilic &#8220;nano&#8208;islands&#8221; on the hydrophilic FeNi LDH catalyst. Therefore, the mass&#8208;transport &#8220;highway&#8221; for O2 and water is segregated on the nanoscale, which significantly enlarges the area of three&#8208;phase boundaries and greatly promotes the mass&#8208;transfer therein.








Abstract
The establishment of abundant three&#8208;phase interfaces with accelerated mass transfer in air cathodes is highly desirable for the development of high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;cycling rechargeable&#160;zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs). Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) exhibit tailored nanopore structures, facilitating the rational tuning of their specific properties. Here, by finely tuning the fluorinated nanopores of a COF, a novel air cathode for rechargeable ZABs is unprecedentedly designed and synthesized. COF&#160;nanosheets are decorated with fluorinated alkyl chains, which shows high affinity to oxygen (O2), in its nanopores (fluorinated COF). The fluorinated COF&#160;nanosheets are stacked into well&#8208;defined O2&#8208;transport channels, which are then assembled into aerophilic &#8220;nano&#8208;islands&#8221; on the hydrophilic FeNi layered&#8208;double&#8208;hydroxide (FeNi LDH) electrocatalyst surface. Therefore, the mass&#8208;transport &#8220;highway&#8221; for O2 and water is segregated on the nanoscale, which significantly enlarges the area of three&#8208;phase boundaries and greatly promotes the mass&#8208;transfer therein. ZABs based on the COF&#8208;modified air cathode deliver a small charge/discharge voltage gap (0.64&#160;V at 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2), a peak power density (118&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2), and a stable cyclability. This work provides a feasible approach for the design of the air cathodes for high&#8208;performance ZABs, and will expand the new application of COFs.

         <title>Tailoring the Plasticity of Topologically Close&#8208;packed Phases via the Crystals&#8217; Fundamental Building Blocks</title>

Abstract
Brittle topologically close&#8208;packed precipitates form in many advanced alloys. Due to their complex structures little is known about their plasticity. Here, we present a strategy to understand and tailor the deformability of these complex phases by considering the Nb&#8208;Co &#956;&#8208;phase as an archetypal material. The plasticity of the Nb&#8208;Co &#956;&#8208;phase is controlled by the Laves phase building block that forms parts of its unit cell. We find that between the bulk C15&#8208;NbCo2 Laves and Nb&#8208;Co &#956;&#8208;phase, the interplanar spacing and local stiffness of the Laves phase building block change, leading to a strong reduction in hardness and stiffness, as well as a transition from synchroshear to crystallographic slip. Furthermore, as the composition changes from Nb6Co7 to Nb7Co6, the Co atoms in the triple layer are substituted such that the triple layer of the Laves phase building block becomes a slab of pure Nb, resulting in inhomogeneous changes in elasticity and a transition from crystallographic slip to a glide&#8208;and&#8208;shuffle mechanism. These findings open opportunities to purposefully tailor the plasticity of these topologically close&#8208;packed phases in the bulk by manipulating the interplanar spacing and local shear modulus of the fundamental crystal building blocks at the atomic scale.

         <title>Influence of Water Content on Speciation and Phase Formation in Zr&#8208;Porphyrin&#8208;Based MOFs Special Issue on Hygroscopic Materials</title>

Abstract
Controlled synthesis of phase&#8208;pure metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is essential for their application in technological areas such as catalysis or gas sorption. Yet, knowledge of their phase formation and growth remain rather limited, particularly with respect to species whose role in MOF synthesis is often uncontrolled or neglected completely. Water, either as contaminant in the solvent, or adsorbed from the atmosphere or reactor surface, is an example of such species. As a consequence, synthetic protocols often lack reproducibility when multiple MOFs can form from the same metal source and linker, and phase mixtures are obtained with little or no control over their composition. In this work, we investigate the role of water in the formation of the disordered Zr&#8211;porphyrin MOF dPCN&#8208;224 under controlled reaction conditions. Through X&#8208;ray total scattering and electron microscopy measurements, we observe that dPCN&#8208;224 forms via a metal&#8211;organic intermediate that consists of Zr6O4(OH)4 clusters linked by tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxy&#8208;phenyl)porphyrin molecules. Importantly, water is not only essential to the formation of Zr6O4(OH)4 clusters, but it also plays a primary role in dictating the formation kinetics of phase&#8208;pure dPCN&#8208;224. Our multidisciplinary approach to studying the speciation of dPCN&#8208;224 provides a blueprint for how Zr&#8208;MOF synthesis protocols can be assessed and their reproducibility increased, and highlights the importance of understanding the role of water as a decisive component in Zr&#8208;MOF formation.

         <title>Full Site&#8208;specific Addressability in DNA Origami&#8208;templated Silica Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
DNA nanotechnology allows for the fabrication of nano&#8208;meter&#8208;sized objects with high precision and selective addressability as a result of the programmable hybridization of complementary DNA strands. Such structures can template the formation of other materials, including metals and complex silica nanostructures, where the silica shell simultaneously acts to protect the DNA from external detrimental factors. However, the formation of silica nanostructures with site&#8208;specific addressability has thus far not been explored. Here we show that silica nanostructures templated by DNA origami remain addressable for post silicification modification with guest molecules even if the silica shell measures several nm in thickness. We use the conjugation of fluorescently labelled oligonucleotides to different silicified DNA origami structures carrying a complementary ssDNA handle as well as DNA&#8208;PAINT super&#8208;resolution imaging to show that ssDNA handles remain unsilicified and thus ensure retained addressability. We also demonstrate that not only handles, but also ssDNA scaffold segments within a DNA origami nanostructure remain accessible, allowing for the formation of dynamic silica nanostructures. Finally, we demonstrate the power of this approach by forming 3D DNA origami crystals from silicified monomers. Our results thus present a fully site&#8208;specifically addressable silica nanostructure with complete control over size and shape.

         <title>Asymmetrically coordinated CoB1N3 moieties for selective generation of high&#8208;valent Co&#8208;oxo species via coupled electron&#8208;proton transfer in Fenton&#8208;like reactions</title>

Abstract
High&#8208;valent metal species generated in peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;based Fenton&#8208;like processes are promising candidates for selective degradation of contaminants in water, the formation of which necessitates the cleavage of O&#8208;H and O&#8208;O bonds as well as efficient electron transfer. However, the high dissociation energy of O&#8208;H bond makes its cleavage quite challenging, largely hampering the selective generation of reactive oxygen species. Herein, an asymmetrical configuration characterized by a single cobalt atom coordinated with boron and nitrogen (CoB1N3) is established to offer a strong local electric field, upon which the cleavage of O&#8208;H bond is thermodynamically favoured via promoted coupled electron&#8208;proton transfer process, which serves an essential step to further allow O&#8208;O bond cleavage and efficient electron transfer. Accordingly, the selective formation of Co(IV) = O in single&#8208;atom Co/PMS system enables highly efficient removal performance towards various organic pollutants. The proposed strategy also holds true in other heteroatom doping system to configure asymmetric coordination, thus paving alternative pathways for specific reactive species conversion by rationalized design of catalysts at atomic level towards environmental applications and more.

&lt;p&gt;High-valent metal species generated in peroxymonosulfate (PMS)-based Fenton-like processes are promising candidates for selective degradation of contaminants in water, the formation of which necessitates the cleavage of O-H and O-O bonds as well as efficient electron transfer. However, the high dissociation energy of O-H bond makes its cleavage quite challenging, largely hampering the selective generation of reactive oxygen species. Herein, an asymmetrical configuration characterized by a single cobalt atom coordinated with boron and nitrogen (CoB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is established to offer a strong local electric field, upon which the cleavage of O-H bond is thermodynamically favoured via promoted coupled electron-proton transfer process, which serves an essential step to further allow O-O bond cleavage and efficient electron transfer. Accordingly, the selective formation of Co(IV) = O in single-atom Co/PMS system enables highly efficient removal performance towards various organic pollutants. The proposed strategy also holds true in other heteroatom doping system to configure asymmetric coordination, thus paving alternative pathways for specific reactive species conversion by rationalized design of catalysts at atomic level towards environmental applications and more.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Poly(dimethylsiloxane)&#8208;block&#8208;PM6 Polymer Donors for High&#8208;Performance and Mechanically&#8208;Robust Polymer Solar Cells</title>

Abstract
High power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stretchability are the dual requirements for the wearable application of polymer solar cells (PSCs). However, most efficient photoactive blend films are mechanically brittle. Here, we achieve highly efficient (PCE = 18%) and mechanically robust (crack&#8208;onset strain (COS) = 18%) PSCs by designing block copolymer (BCP) donors, PM6&#8208;b&#8208;PDMSx (x = 5k, 12k, and 19k). In these BCP donors, stretchable polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) blocks are covalently linked with the PM6 blocks to effectively increase the stretchability, while preserving the electrical properties of conjugated polymer blocks. The stretchability of the BCP donors increases with a longer PDMS block, and PM6&#8208;b&#8208;PDMS19k:L8&#8208;BO PSC exhibits a high PCE (18%) and 9&#8208;times higher COS value (18%) compared to that (COS = 2%) of the PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based PSC. Without covalent bonding of the PDMS block, PM6:L8&#8208;BO:PDMS12k ternary blend shows inferior PCE (4%) and COS (1%) due to the phase separation between PDMS and active components. In the intrinsically&#8208;stretchable PSC, PM6&#8208;b&#8208;PDMS19k:L8&#8208;BO blend exhibits significantly greater mechanical stability of PCE80% (80% of the initial PCE) at 36% strain than PM6: L8&#8208;BO blend (PCE80% at 12% strain) and PM6: L8&#8208;BO:PDMS ternary blend (PCE80% at 4% strain). This study demonstrates an effective design strategy of BCP PD to achieve stretchable PSCs with high efficiency.

         <title>Role of Magnetic Defects in Tuning Ground States of Magnetic Topological Insulators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inelastic neutron scattering measurements reveal the formation of linear Mn&#8211;Te&#8211;Mn antiferromagnetic dimers in Mn&#8208;doped Sb2Te3, following the Goodenough&#8211;Kanamori superexchange rule. Although the system is magnetically dilute, the experiments identify ferromagnetic dimers and correlations in the interblock across the van der Waals gap. These interactions explain the role of defects in tuning ground&#8208;states in magnetic topological insulators.








Abstract
Magnetic defects play an important, but poorly understood, role in magnetic topological insulators (TIs). For example, topological surface transport and bulk magnetic properties are controlled by magnetic defects in Bi2Se3&#8208;based dilute ferromagnetic (FM) TIs and MnBi2Te4 (MBT)&#8208;based antiferromagnetic (AFM) TIs. Despite its nascent ferromagnetism, the inelastic neutron scattering data show that a fraction of the Mn defects in Sb2Te3 form strong AFM dimer singlets within a quintuple block. The AFM superexchange coupling occurs via Mn&#8211;Te&#8211;Mn linear bonds and is identical to the AFM coupling between antisite defects and the FM Mn layer in MBT, establishing common interactions in the two materials classes. It is also found that the FM correlations in (Sb1&#8722;xMnx)2Te3 are likely driven by magnetic defects in adjacent quintuple blocks across the van der Waals gap. In addition to providing answers to long&#8208;standing questions about the evolution of FM order in dilute TI, these results also show that the evolution of global magnetic order from AFM to FM in Sb&#8208;substituted MBT is controlled by defect engineering of the intrablock and interblock&#160;coupling.

         <title>Voltage&#8208;Modulated Untwist Deformations and Multispectral Optical Effects from Ion Intercalation into Chiral Ceramic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral V2O3 nanoparticles display rich palette of intense chiroptical bands. Intercalation&#8211;deintercalation of Zn2+ leads to twist&#8211;untwist deformation and modulation of optical activity, which is remarkably strong for IR and NIR range because V2O3 nanoparticles have g&#8208;factors &#8776;100&#8211;400 times higher than other nanostructures. Device prototypes based on layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembled nanocomposite films provide a pathway to versatile voltage&#8208;driven photonic devices.








Abstract
Reconfiguration of chiral ceramic nanostructures after ion intercalation should favor specific nanoscale twists leading to strong chiroptical effects. &#160;In this work, V2O3 nanoparticles are shown to have &#8220;built&#8208;in&#8221; chiral distortions caused by binding of tartaric acid enantiomers to the nanoparticle surface. As evidenced by spectroscopy/microscopy techniques and calculations of nanoscale chirality measures, the intercalation of Zn2+ ions into the V2O3 lattice results in particle expansion, untwist deformations, and chirality reduction. Coherent deformations in the particle ensemble manifest as changes in sign and positions of circular polarization bands at ultraviolet, visible, mid&#8208;infrared (IR), near&#8208;IR (NIR), and IR wavelengths. The g&#8208;factors observed for IR and NIR spectral diapasons are &#8776;100&#8211;400 times higher than those for previously reported dielectric, semiconductor, and plasmonic nanoparticles. Nanocomposite films layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembled (LBL) from V2O3 nanoparticles reveal cyclic&#8208;voltage&#8208;driven modulation of optical activity. Device prototypes for IR and NIR range problematic for liquid crystals and other organic materials are demonstrated. High optical activity, synthetic simplicity, sustainable processability, and environmental robustness of the chiral LBL nanocomposites provide a versatile platform for photonic devices. Similar reconfigurations of particle shapes are expected for multiple chiral ceramic nanostructures, leading to unique optical, electrical, and magnetic properties.

         <title>Transformation from Magnetic Soliton to Skyrmion in a Monoaxial Chiral Magnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction determines the formation of single&#8208;twisted magnetic solitons (e.g., CrNb3S6) or multi&#8208;twisted magnetic skyrmions (e.g., FeGe) in chiral magnets with different crystallographic symmetries. A topological phase transition from magnetic solitons to elongated skyrmions is observed in a geometrically&#160;confined nanostripe of monoaxial CrNb3S6&#160;crystals, in which the magnetic dipolar interactions play a key role.








Abstract
Topological spin textures are of great interest for both fundamental physics and applications in spintronics. The Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction underpins the formation of single&#8208;twisted magnetic solitons or multi&#8208;twisted magnetic skyrmions in magnetic materials with different crystallographic symmetries. However, topological transitions between these two kinds of topological objects have not been verified experimentally. Here, the direct observation of transformations from a chiral soliton lattice (CSL) to magnetic skyrmions in a nanostripe of the monoaxial chiral magnet CrNb3S6&#160;using Lorentz transmission electron microscopy is reported. In the presence of an external magnetic field, helical spin structures first transform into CSLs and then evolve into isolated elongated magnetic skyrmions. The detailed spin textures of the elongated magnetic skyrmions are resolved using off&#8208;axis electron holography and are shown to comprise two merons, which enclose their ends and have unit total topological charge. Magnetic dipolar interactions are shown to play a key role in the magnetic soliton&#8211;skyrmion transformation, which depends sensitively on nanostripe width. The findings here, which are consistent with micromagnetic simulations, enrich the family of topological magnetic states and their transitions and promise to further stimulate the exploration of their emergent electromagnetic properties.

         <title>Coexistence of Merons with Skyrmions in the Centrosymmetric Van Der Waals Ferromagnet Fe5&#8211;xGeTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Contour plot displays the magnitude of the conventional topological Hall effect (THE), revealing that it is particularly strong up to room temperature. Inset: Lorentz&#8208;TEM image from an area of the sample collected at T&#160;= 100 K, highlighting the coexistence of magnetic domains having in&#8208;plane oriented spins that yield merons (green shaded regions) with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ones (purple shaded regions) where skyrmions are observed under a magnetic field.








Abstract
Fe5&#8211;xGeTe2 is a centrosymmetric, layered van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnet that displays Curie temperatures Tc (270&#8211;330 K) that are within the useful range for spintronic applications. However, little is known about the interplay between its topological spin textures (e.g., merons, skyrmions) with technologically relevant transport properties such as the topological Hall effect (THE) or topological thermal transport. Here, via high&#8208;resolution Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, it is shown that merons and anti&#8208;meron pairs coexist with N&#233;el skyrmions in Fe5&#8211;xGeTe2 over a wide range of temperatures and probe their effects on thermal and electrical transport. A THE is detected, even at room T, that senses merons at higher T's, as well as their coexistence with skyrmions as T is lowered, indicating an on&#8208;demand thermally driven formation of either type of spin texture. Remarkably, an unconventional THE is also observed in absence of Lorentz force, and it is attributed to the interaction between charge carriers and magnetic field&#8208;induced chiral spin textures. These results expose Fe5&#8211;xGeTe2 as a promising candidate for the development of applications in skyrmionics/meronics due to the interplay between distinct but coexisting topological magnetic textures and unconventional transport of charge/heat carriers.

         <title>Boosting Ferroptosis Therapy with Iridium Single&#8208;Atom Nanocatalyst in Ultralow Metal Content</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iridium (Ir) single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) with fully exposed active sites is synthesized to effectively catalyze the conversion of endogenous H2O2 to &#8226;OH and depletion of glutathione with ultralow metal content in the tumor microenvironment. With an advanced support of GSH&#8208;trapping platinum(IV) and encapsulation with a red&#8208;blood&#8208;cell membrane, this nanoagent (Pt@IrSAC/RBC) causes intense lipid peroxidation that boosts tumor cell ferroptosis.








Abstract
Nanocatalysts are promising tumor therapeutics due to their ability to induce reactive oxygen species in the tumor microenvironment. Although increasing metal loading can improve catalytic activity, the quandary of high metal content versus potential systemic biotoxicity remains challenging. Here, a fully exposed active site strategy by site&#8208;specific anchoring of single iridium (Ir) atoms on the outer surface of a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon composite (Ir single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC)) is reported to achieve remarkable catalytic performance at ultralow metal content (&#8776;0.11%). The Ir SAC exhibits prominent dual enzymatic activities to mimic peroxidase and glutathione peroxidase, which catalyzes the conversion of endogenous H2O2 into &#8226;OH in the acidic TME and depletes glutathione (GSH) simultaneously. With an advanced support of GSH&#8208;trapping platinum(IV) and encapsulation with a red&#8208;blood&#8208;cell membrane, this nanocatalytic agent (Pt@IrSAC/RBC) causes intense lipid peroxidation that boosts tumor cell ferroptosis. The Pt@IrSAC/RBC demonstrates superior therapeutic efficacy in a mouse triple&#8208;negative mammary carcinoma model, resulting in complete tumor ablation in a single treatment session with negligible side effects. These outcomes may provide valuable insights into the design of nanocatalysts with high performance and biosafety for biomedical applications.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Driven Liquid Electrolytes for Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy alloys/materials are attracting significant attention in materials science, where the higher entropy facilitates the formation of solid&#8208;solution phases. In this work, a general strategy is reported to enhance the solubility of specific salts in liquid electrolytes&#160;by introducing multiple salts to form a high&#8208;entropy solution that assists in stabilizing the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphases, that changes the solvation interactions, which can be used to improve battery performances.








Abstract
Developing liquid electrolytes with higher kinetics and enhanced interphase stability is one of the key challenges for lithium batteries. However, the poor solubility of lithium salts in solvents sets constraints that compromises the electrolyte properties. Here, it is shown that introducing multiple salts to form a high&#8208;entropy solution, alters the solvation structure, which can be used to raise the solubility of specific salts and stabilize electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphases. The prepared high&#8208;entropy electrolytes significantly enhance the cycling and rate performance of lithium batteries. For lithium&#8208;metal anodes the reversibility exceeds 99%, which extends the cycle life of batteries even under aggressive cycling conditions. For commercial batteries, combining a graphite anode with a LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode, more than 1000 charge&#8211;discharge cycles are achieved while maintaining a capacity retention of more than 90%. These performance improvements with respect to regular electrolytes are rationalized by the unique features of the solvation structure in high&#8208;entropy electrolytes. The weaker solvation interaction induced by the higher disorder results in improved lithium&#8208;ion kinetics, and the altered solvation composition leads to stabilized interphases. Finally, the high&#8208;entropy, induced by the presence of multiple salts, enables a decrease in melting temperature of the electrolytes and thus enables lower battery operation temperatures without changing the solvents.

         <title>Attenuating Metabolic Competition of Tumor Cells for Favoring the Nutritional Demand of Immune Cells by a Branched Polymeric Drug Delivery System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A branched polymeric drug delivery system can be used as a previously unknown metabolic modulator to improve the tumor immune microenvironment via interfering with the metabolic processes of tumor cells to increase the concentration of essential nutrients and reduce the level of immunosuppressive metabolites in the tumor microenvironment, thus creating a favorable environment for infiltrated immune cells.








Abstract
Tumor cells are dominant in the nutritional competition in the tumor microenvironment, and their metabolic abnormalities often lead to microenvironmental acidosis and nutrient deprivation, thereby impairing the function of immune cells and diminishing the antitumor therapeutic effect. Herein, a branched polymeric conjugate and its efficacy in attenuating the metabolic competition of tumor cells are reported. Compared with the control nanoparticles prepared from its linear counterpart, the branched&#8208;conjugate&#8208;based nanoparticles can more efficiently accumulate in the tumor tissue and interfere with the metabolic processes of tumor cells to increase the concentration of essential nutrients and reduce the level of immunosuppressive metabolites in the TME, thus creating a favorable environment for infiltrated immune cells. Its combined treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) achieves an enhanced antitumor effect. The work presents a promising approach for targeting metabolic competition in the TME to enhance the chemo&#8208;immunotherapeutic effect against cancers.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Enhanced Microwave Attenuation in Titanate Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to create the high&#8208;entropy&#8208;stabilized (Ca0.2Sr0.2Ba0.2La0.2Pb0.2)TiO3&#160;perovskite that exhibits an enhanced effective microwave absorption band (90% absorption) is designed and developed. The favorable microstructural features, including abundant grain boundaries, oxygen defects, and strong shear strain caused by ultradense distorted lattices, can be achieved by regulating the entropy configuration.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs), which incorporate multiple&#8208;principal cations into single&#8208;phase crystals and interact with diverse metal ions, extend the border for available compositions and unprecedented properties. Herein, a high&#8208;entropy&#8208;stabilized (Ca0.2Sr0.2Ba0.2La0.2Pb0.2)TiO3&#160;perovskite is reported, and the effective absorption bandwidth (90% absorption) improves almost two times than that of BaTiO3. The results demonstrate that the regulation of entropy configuration can yield significant grain boundaries, oxygen defects, and an ultradense distorted lattice. These characteristics give rise to strong interfacial and defect&#8208;induced polarizations, thus synergistically contributing to the dielectric attenuation performance. Moreover, the large strains derived from the strong lattice distortions in the high&#8208;entropy perovskite offer varied transport for electron carriers. The high&#8208;entropy&#8208;enhanced positive/negative charges accumulation around grain boundaries and strain&#8208;concentrated location, quantitatively validated by electron holography, results in unusual dielectric polarization loss. This study opens up an effective avenue for designing strong microwave absorption materials to satisfy the increasingly demanding requirements of advanced and integrated electronics.

&lt;p&gt;A strategy to create the high-entropy-stabilized (Ca&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Ba&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;)TiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;perovskite that exhibits an enhanced effective microwave absorption band (90% absorption) is designed and developed. The favorable microstructural features, including abundant grain boundaries, oxygen defects, and strong shear strain caused by ultradense distorted lattices, can be achieved by regulating the entropy configuration.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-entropy oxides (HEOs), which incorporate multiple-principal cations into single-phase crystals and interact with diverse metal ions, extend the border for available compositions and unprecedented properties. Herein, a high-entropy-stabilized (Ca&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Ba&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;)TiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;perovskite is reported, and the effective absorption bandwidth (90% absorption) improves almost two times than that of BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The results demonstrate that the regulation of entropy configuration can yield significant grain boundaries, oxygen defects, and an ultradense distorted lattice. These characteristics give rise to strong interfacial and defect-induced polarizations, thus synergistically contributing to the dielectric attenuation performance. Moreover, the large strains derived from the strong lattice distortions in the high-entropy perovskite offer varied transport for electron carriers. The high-entropy-enhanced positive/negative charges accumulation around grain boundaries and strain-concentrated location, quantitatively validated by electron holography, results in unusual dielectric polarization loss. This study opens up an effective avenue for designing strong microwave absorption materials to satisfy the increasingly demanding requirements of advanced and integrated electronics. This work also offers a paradigm for improving other interesting properties for HEOs through entropy engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Responsive STAT3 Inhibitor Nanoprodrug Combined with Oncolytic Virus Elicits Synergistic Antitumor Immune Responses by Igniting Pyroptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combination therapy with oHSV&#160;+&#160;MPNPs boosts the effects of immune checkpoint therapy by inducing gasdermin&#8208;E&#8208;based tumor pyroptosis, reversing the immunosuppressive microenvironment, and inducing effective immune memory, thus potentiating anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 effects against local recurrence and pulmonary metastasis and consequently elongating the survival period. The nanoprodrugs&#160;+&#160;oncolytic viruses strategy represents a promising way to overcome immune checkpoint blockade resistance.








Abstract
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy shows excellent efficacy against malignancies; however, insufficient tumor immunogenicity and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) are considered as the two major stumbling blocks to a broad ICB response. Here, a combinational therapeutic strategy is reported, wherein TME&#8208;reactive oxygen species/pH dual&#8208;responsive signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 inhibitor nanoprodrugs MPNPs are combined with oncolytic herpes simplex virus 1 virotherapy to synergistically ignite pyroptosis for enhancing immunotherapy. MPNPs exhibit a certain level of tumor accumulation, reduce tumor cell stemness, and enhance antitumor immune responses. Furthermore, the simultaneous application of oncolytic viruses (OVs) confers MPNPs with higher tumor penetration capacity and remarkable gasdermin&#8208;E&#8208;mediated pyroptosis, thereby reshaping the TME and transforming &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors into &#8220;hot&#8221; ones. This &#8220;fire of immunity&#8221; strategy successfully activates robust T&#8208;cell&#8208;dependent antitumor responses, potentiating ICB effects against local recurrence and pulmonary metastasis in preclinical &#8220;cold&#8221; murine triple&#8208;negative breast cancer and syngeneic oral cancer models. Collectively, this work may pave a new way and offer an unprecedented opportunity for the combination of OVs with nanomedicine for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Triplet Fusion Upconversion for Photocuring 3D&#8208;Printed Particle&#8208;Reinforced Composite Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct&#8208;ink&#8208;write printing and photocuring of opaque hydrogel composites are enabled by multiexciton triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion. Low energy red light is used for better penetration into opaque hydrogels and the upconverted blue light induces the free radical photopolymerization process. This method allows conventional photoinitiation systems to modify objects that block high energy photons.








Abstract
High energy photons (&#955;&#160;&lt;&#160;400&#160;nm) are frequently used to initiate free radical polymerizations to form polymer networks, but are only effective for transparent objects. This phenomenon poses a major challenge to additive manufacturing of particle&#8208;reinforced composite networks since deep light penetration of short&#8208;wavelength photons limits the homogeneous modification of physicochemical and mechanical properties. Herein, the unconventional, yet versatile, multiexciton process of triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) is employed for curing opaque hydrogel composites created by direct&#8208;ink&#8208;write (DIW) 3D printing. TTA&#8208;UC converts low energy red light (&#955;max&#160;=&#160;660&#160;nm) for deep penetration into higher&#8208;energy blue light to initiate free radical polymerizations within opaque objects. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, hydrogels containing up to 15&#160;wt.% TiO2 filler particles and doped with TTA&#8208;UC chromophores are readily cured with red light, while composites without the chromophores and TiO2 loadings as little as 1&#8211;2&#160;wt.% remain uncured. Importantly, this method has wide potential to modify the chemical and mechanical properties of complex DIW 3D&#8208;printed composite polymer networks.

         <title>Radiative Recombination Processes in Halide Perovskites Observed by Light Emission Voltage Modulated Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new methodology to analyze the kinetics that determine the light emission in voltage&#8208;driven devices is presented. It consists of combining the voltage&#8208;modulated light emission with impedance spectroscopy, whose spectra are interpreted according to the described equivalent circuit. This method, which is unprecedently applied to perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes with high radiative efficiency, reveals electronic steps that delay the radiative event.








Abstract
The kinetics of light emission in halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) and solar cells is composed of a radiative recombination of voltage&#8208;injected carriers mediated by additional steps such as carrier trapping, redistribution of injected carriers, and photon recycling that affect the observed luminescence decays. These processes are investigated in high&#8208;performance halide perovskite LEDs, with external quantum efficiency (EQE) and luminance values higher than 20% and 80&#160;000 Cd m&#8722;2, by measuring the frequency&#8208;resolved emitted light with respect to modulated voltage through a new methodology termed light emission voltage modulated spectroscopy (LEVS). The spectra are shown to provide detailed information on at least three different characteristic times. Essentially, new information is obtained with respect to the electrical method of impedance spectroscopy (IS), and overall, LEVS shows promise to capture internal kinetics that are difficult to be discerned by other techniques.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Induced Hole Coherence and Spatial Self&#8208;Phase Modulation in the Anisotropic 3D Weyl Semimetal TaAs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatial self&#8208;phase modulation (SSPM), a third&#8208;order nonlinear optical response is observed in a Weyl semimetal TaAs. This extends previous SSPM discoveries in 0D, 1D, and 2D materials into 3D materials. Also amazing is that it reveals the long&#8208;sought laser&#8208;induced hole coherence. Furthermore, SSPM in a topological semimetal is reported.








Abstract
Laser&#8208;induced electron coherence is a fascinating topic in manipulating quantum materials. Recently, it has been shown that laser&#8208;induced electron coherence in 2D materials can produce a third&#8208;order nonlinear optical response spatial self&#8208;phase modulation (SSPM), which has been used to develop a novel all&#8208;optical switching scheme. However, such investigations have mainly focused on electron coherence, whereas laser&#8208;induced hole coherence is rarely explored. Here, the observation of the optical Kerr effect in 3D Weyl semimetal TaAs flakes is reported. The nonlinear susceptibility (&#967;(3)) is obtained, which exhibits a surprisingly high value (with &#967;one&#8722;layer(3)\[{\bm{\chi }}_{{\bf one}{\bm{ - }}{\bf layer}}^{{\bf (3)}}\] = 9.9&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;9 e.s.u. or 1.4&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;16&#160;m2&#160;V&#8722;2 at 532&#160;nm). This cannot be explained by the conventional electron mobility, but can be well understood by the unique high anisotropic hole mobility of TaAs. The wind&#8208;chime model and &#967;(3) carrier mobility correlation adequately explain the results, suggesting the crucial role of laser&#8208;induced nonlocal ac hole coherence. These observations extend the understanding of SSPM from 2D to 3D quantum materials with anisotropic carrier mobility and from electron coherence to hole coherence.

The nonlinear susceptibility (&#967;&lt;sup&gt;(3)&lt;/sup&gt;) is obtained, which exhibits a surprisingly high value (with &#967;one&#8722;layer(3)\[{\bm{\chi }}_{{\bf one}{\bm{ - }}{\bf layer}}^{{\bf (3)}}\] = 9.9&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;9&lt;/sup&gt; e.s.u. or 1.4&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;16&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 532&#160;nm). This cannot be explained by the conventional electron mobility, but can be well understood by the unique high anisotropic hole mobility of TaAs. The wind-chime model and &#967;&lt;sup&gt;(3)&lt;/sup&gt; carrier mobility correlation adequately explain the results, suggesting the crucial role of laser-induced nonlocal ac hole coherence. These observations extend the understanding of SSPM from 2D to 3D quantum materials with anisotropic carrier mobility and from electron coherence to hole coherence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient, Color&#8208;Stable, and Long&#8208;Lived White Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Utilizing Phosphorescent Molecular Aggregates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Development of single&#8208;stack hybrid white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (WOLEDs) uses amber&#8208;colored aggregate emission and blue fluorescence emission to achieve high efficiencies, long operational lifetimes, and excellent color stabilities under various driving conditions. As far as it is known, this is the most stable single&#8208;stack white OLED device among all reported white OLEDs on the public domain.








Abstract
Highly efficient and stable single&#8208;stack hybrid white organic light&#8208;emitting diode (WOLED) devices are developed using two emissive layers: one with amber&#8208;colored phosphorescent molecular&#8208;aggregate emission from the Pd(II) complex, Pd(II) 7&#8208;(3&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;&#954;N)phenoxy&#8208;&#954;C)(benzo&#8208;&#954;C)([c]benzo[4,5]imidazo&#8208;&#954;N)[1,2&#8208;a][1,5]naphthyridine, Pd3O8&#8208;Py5, and the other with blue fluorescence emission. An optimized device structure achieves high color stability under various current densities, an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 45.5%, a power efficiency of 97.4 Lm W&#8722;1, and an estimated LT95 (operational time to 95% of the initial luminance) of 50 744 h at an initial luminance of 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2.

         <title>Oral Delivery of siRNA Using Fluorinated, Small&#8208;Sized Nanocapsules toward Anti&#8208;Inflammation Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;sized, reversibly cross&#8208;linked, fluorinated nanocapsules are developed to mediate efficient intestinal absorption of siRNA and systemic tumor necrosis factor &#945; gene silencing via oral administration. They feature high oral bioavailability of 20.4%, and demonstrate potent anti&#8208;inflammatory efficacy against both acute and chronic inflammation. This study provides a transformative platform for oral siRNA delivery.








Abstract
Oral delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) provides a promising paradigm for treating diseases that require regular injections. However, the multiple gastrointestinal (GI) and systemic barriers often lead to inefficient oral absorption and low bioavailability of siRNA. Technologies that can overcome these barriers are still lacking, which hinders the clinical potential of orally delivered siRNA. Herein, small&#8208;sized, fluorinated nanocapsules (F&#8208;NCs) are developed to mediate efficient oral delivery of tumor necrosis factor &#945; (TNF&#8208;&#945;) siRNA for anti&#8208;inflammation treatment. The NCs possess a disulfide&#8208;cross&#8208;linked shell structure, thus featuring robust stability in the GI tract. Because of their small size (&#8776;30&#160;nm) and fluorocarbon&#8208;assisted repelling of mucin adsorption, the best&#8208;performing F3&#8208;NCs show excellent mucus penetration and intestinal transport capabilities without impairing the intestinal tight junction, conferring the oral bioavailability of 20.4% in relative to intravenous injection. The disulfide cross&#8208;linker can be cleaved inside target cells, causing NCs dissociation and siRNA release to potentiate the TNF&#8208;&#945; silencing efficiency. In murine models of acute and chronic inflammation, orally delivered F3&#8208;NCs provoke efficient TNF&#8208;&#945; silencing and pronounced anti&#8208;inflammatory efficacies. This study therefore provides a transformative strategy for oral siRNA delivery, and will render promising utilities for anti&#8208;inflammation treatment.

         <title>Hybridization Engineering of Oxyfluoride Aluminosilicate Glass for Construction of Dual&#8208;Phase Optical Ceramics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild strategy for constructing dual&#8208;phase optical ceramics and ceramics with fiber geometry by stepped dual&#8208;phase crystallization of hybridized glass is proposed. The strategy has excellent generality, and candidates with various chemical compositions, phase combinations, and morphologies are produced. They have practical applications in lighting and X&#8208;ray imaging. These findings expand the scope of optical ceramics.








Abstract
The construction of transparent ceramics under mild conditionsand standard atmospheric pressure has great scientific and technological potential; however, it remains difficult to achieve when conventional ceramic sintering techniques are used. Herein, a mild strategy for constructing dual&#8208;phase optical ceramics with high crystallinity (&gt;90%) based on the stepped dual&#8208;phase crystallization of hybridized aluminosilicate glass is presented. Theoretical and experimental studies reveal that the hybridization of the glass system enables a new balance between the glass&#8208;forming ability and crystallization and can overcome the uncontrolled devitrification phenomenon during the dense crystallization of glass. Transparent hybridized oxide&#8208;fluoride ceramics with fiber geometry and dual&#8208;phase microstructures are also successfully fabricated. The generality of the strategy is confirmed, and transparent ceramics with various chemical compositions and phase combinations are prepared. Additionally, the cross&#8208;section of the ceramic fibers can be easily tuned into a circle, square, trapezoid, or even a triangle. Furthermore, the practical applications of optical ceramics for lighting and X&#8208;ray imaging are demonstrated. The findings described here suggest a major step toward expanding the scope of optical ceramics.

         <title>3D Printing of Self&#8208;Assembling Nanofibrous Multidomain Peptide Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multidomain peptides (MDPs), a class of self&#8208;assembling peptides, are used to 3D print complex, 3D structures. Multiple MDPs are demonstrated as printable, and oppositely charged MDPs are printed together into layered, porous constructs. MDPs are found to support high cell viability regardless of charge, while charge is shown to influence cellular behavior and morphology.








Abstract
3D printing has become one of the primary fabrication strategies used in biomedical research. Recent efforts have focused on the 3D printing of hydrogels to create structures that better replicate the mechanical properties of biological tissues. These pose a unique challenge, as soft materials are difficult to pattern in three dimensions with high fidelity. Currently, a small number of biologically derived polymers that form hydrogels are frequently reused for 3D printing applications. Thus, there exists a need for novel hydrogels with desirable biological properties that can be used as 3D printable inks. In this work, the printability of multidomain peptides (MDPs), a class of self&#8208;assembling peptides that form a nanofibrous hydrogel at low concentrations, is established. MDPs with different charge functionalities are optimized as distinct inks and are used to create complex 3D structures, including multi&#8208;MDP prints. Additionally, printed MDP constructs are used to demonstrate charge&#8208;dependent differences in cellular behavior in vitro. This work presents the first time that self&#8208;assembling peptides have been used to print layered structures with overhangs and internal porosity. Overall, MDPs are a promising new class of 3D printable inks that are uniquely peptide&#8208;based and rely solely on supramolecular mechanisms for assembly.

         <title>Mitochondrial&#8208;Targeted Delivery of Polyphenol&#8208;Mediated Antioxidases Complexes against Pyroptosis and Inflammatory Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyphenols such as tannic acid (TA) are able to mediate the targeting of polyphenol/antioxidases complexes to mitochondria, stemming from the strong binding of TA to mitochondrial outer membrane proteins. Superoxide dismutase, catalase, and TA are assembled into complexes for efficiently scavenging excess mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and reversing mitochondrial depolarization, thereby inhibiting inflammasome&#8208;mediated pyroptosis and alleviate pyroptosis&#8208;related hepatitis.








Abstract
Excess accumulation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) is a key target for inhibiting pyroptosis&#8208;induced inflammation and tissue damage. However, targeted delivery of drugs to mitochondria and efficient clearance of mtROS remain challenging. In current study, it is discovered that polyphenols such as tannic acid (TA) can mediate the targeting of polyphenol/antioxidases complexes to mitochondria. This affinity does not depend on mitochondrial membrane potential but stems from the strong binding of TA to mitochondrial outer membrane proteins. Taking advantage of the feasibility of self&#8208;assembly between TA and proteins, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and TA are assembled into complexes (referred to as TSC) for efficient enzymatic activity maintenance. In vitro fluorescence confocal imaging shows that TSC not only promoted the uptake of biological enzymes in hepatocytes but also highly overlapped with mitochondria after lysosomal escape. The results from an in vitro model of hepatocyte oxidative stress demonstrate that TSC efficiently scavenges excess mtROS and reverses mitochondrial depolarization, thereby inhibiting inflammasome&#8208;mediated pyroptosis. More interestingly, TSC maintain superior efficacy compared with the clinical gold standard drug N&#8208;acetylcysteine in both acetaminophen&#8208; and D&#8208;galactosamine/lipopolysaccharide&#8208;induced pyroptosis&#8208;related hepatitis mouse models. In conclusion, this study opens a new paradigm for targeting mitochondrial oxidative stress to inhibit pyroptosis and treat inflammatory diseases.

         <title>Inter&#8208;Metal Interaction with a Threshold Effect in NiCu Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigating the inter&#8208;metal site distance effect of dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) can not only promote the full potential of DACs, but also guide the design of advanced atomically&#160;dispersed catalysts. In this work a peripherally distributed NiCu DAC is employed as a case study to investigate the distance (d)&#8208;dependent inter&#8208;metal interaction, and a newly&#160;proposed macro&#8208;descriptor is provided as the guidance for future designing DACs.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) have become an emerging platform to provide more flexible active sites for electrocatalytic reactions with multi&#8208;electron/proton transfer, such as the CO2&#160;reduction reaction (CRR). However, the introduction of asymmetric dual&#8208;atom sites causes complexity in structure, leaving an incomprehensive understanding of the inter&#8208;metal interaction and catalytic mechanism. Taking NiCu DACs as an example, herein, a more rational structural model is proposed, and the distance&#8208;dependent inter&#8208;metal interaction is investigated by combining theoretical simulations and experiments, including density functional theory computation, aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy, synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure, and Monte Carlo experiments. A distance threshold around 5.3&#160;&#197; between adjacent Ni&#63743;N4&#160;and Cu&#63743;N4&#160;moieties is revealed to trigger effective electronic regulation and boost CRR performance on both selectivity and activity. A universal macro&#8208;descriptor rigorously correlating the inter&#8208;metal distance and intrinsic material features (e.g., metal loading and thickness) is established to guide the rational design and synthesis of advanced DACs. This study highlights the significance of identifying the inter&#8208;metal interaction in DACs, and helps bridge the gap between theoretical study and experimental synthesis of atomically dispersed catalysts with highly correlated active sites.

         <title>Reviving Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis of Bulk La&#8211;Ni Intermetallics via Gaseous Hydrogen Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogen processing strategy is utilized to optimize the microstructure of bulk LaNi5 to activate its alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER)&#160;performance. Furthermore, the phase evolution, as well as the role of La during the OER process, is unequivocally decoupled. Hydrogen storage, hydrogen production, and hydrogen application are integrated toward the development of the hydrogen economy.








Abstract
A hydrogen processing strategy is developed to enable bulk LaNi5 to attain high activity and long&#8208;term stability toward the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By a combination of in situ Raman and quasi in situ X&#8208;ray absorption (XAS) spectra, secondary&#8208;electron&#8208;excited scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) patterns as well as the Rietveld method and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is discovered that hydrogen&#8208;induced lattice distortion, grain refinement, and particle cracks dictate the effective reconstruction of the LaNi5 surface into a porous hetero&#8208;nanoarchitecture composed of uniformly confined active &#947;&#8208;NiOOH nanocrystals by La(OH)3 layer in the alkaline OER process. This significantly optimizes the charge transfer, structural integrity, active&#8208;site exposure, and adsorption energy toward the reaction intermediates. Benefiting from these merits, the overpotential (322&#160;mV) at 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for the hydrogen&#8208;processed OER catalyst deposited on nickel foam is reduced by 104&#160;mV as compared to the original phase. Notably, it exhibits remarkable stability for 10 days at an industrial&#8208;grade current density of more than 560&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline media.

         <title>Correlated Rattling of Sodium&#8208;Chains Suppressing Thermal Conduction in Thermoelectric Stannides</title>

         <dc:description>
Tin&#8208;based intermetallics with tunnel frameworks encapsulating zigzag Na&#8208;chains show lower thermal conductivity with decreasing inter&#8208;Na distances. Na atoms behave as Einstein&#8208;like oscillators along the tunnel, while significant interactions exist both between Na atoms in the chain and between the chain and the framework. The large anisotropic oscillations, the correlation of Na atoms in the tunnels, and their interaction with frameworks&#160;lead to low thermal conductivity.








Abstract
Tin&#8208;based intermetallics with tunnel frameworks containing zigzag Na chains that excite correlated rattling impinging on the framework phonons are attractive as thermoelectric materials owing to their low lattice thermal conductivity. The correlated rattling of Na atoms in the zigzag chains and the origin of the low thermal conductivity is uncovered via experimental and computational analyses. The Na atoms behave as oscillators along the tunnel, resulting in substantial interactions between Na atoms in the chain and between the chain and framework. In these intermetallic compounds, a shorter inter&#8208;rattler distance results in lower thermal conductivity, suggesting that phonon scattering by the correlated rattling Na&#8208;chains is enhanced. These results provide new insights into the behavior of thermoelectric materials with low thermal conductivity and suggest strategies for the development of such materials that utilize the correlated rattling.

         <title>Trojan Horse Nanocapsule Enabled In Situ Modulation of the Phenotypic Conversion of Th17 Cells to Treg Cells for the Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis in Mice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocapsule (nC)&#8208;coupled Th17 cells transmigrates across the blood&#8211;brain barrier and homes to the inflamed MS niche in a &#8220;Trojan Horse&#8221;&#8208;like manner. Upon ROS stimulation, (Aminooxy)&#8208;acetic acid is released from the nC, and subsequently enables in situ transformation of Th17 into Treg cells. This phenotypic conversion leads to a domino&#8208;like immune response that is conducive to MS therapy.








Abstract
Th17/Treg imbalance is closely related to the occurrence and development of multiple sclerosis (MS), and the transdifferentiation of Th17 cells into Treg cells may contribute to the resolution of inflammation, presenting a therapeutic strategy for MS. To modulate this phenotypic shift in situ, a &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221;&#8208;like hybrid system, nanocapsule&#8208;coupled Th17 cells, is reported for MS treatment. Following intravenous injection into MS mice, the hybrid system efficiently transmigrates across the blood&#8211;brain barrier and homes to the inflamed MS niche. (Aminooxy)&#8208;acetic acid, a transdifferentiation inducer, is locally released upon the production of ROS and in turn taken up by Th17 cells. It is demonstrated that the Trojan horse hybrid system enables in situ phenotypic transdifferentiation of Th17 cells into anti&#8208;inflammatory Treg cells. This phenotypic conversion leads to a domino&#8208;like immune response that is conducive to MS therapy. Overall, this work highlights a new pathway for accurate modulation of the phenotypes of adoptively transferred cells in situ, from proinflammatory to anti&#8208;inflammatory for MS therapy, and may be broadly applicable for patients suffering from other autoimmune diseases.

Upon ROS stimulation, (Aminooxy)-acetic acid is released from the nC, and subsequently enables in situ transformation of Th17 into Treg cells. This phenotypic conversion leads to a domino-like immune response that is conducive to MS therapy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Th17/Treg imbalance is closely related to the occurrence and development of multiple sclerosis (MS), and the transdifferentiation of Th17 cells into Treg cells may contribute to the resolution of inflammation, presenting a therapeutic strategy for MS. To modulate this phenotypic shift in situ, a &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221;-like hybrid system, nanocapsule-coupled Th17 cells, is reported for MS treatment. Following intravenous injection into MS mice, the hybrid system efficiently transmigrates across the blood&#8211;brain barrier and homes to the inflamed MS niche. (Aminooxy)-acetic acid, a transdifferentiation inducer, is locally released upon the production of ROS and in turn taken up by Th17 cells. It is demonstrated that the Trojan horse hybrid system enables in situ phenotypic transdifferentiation of Th17 cells into anti-inflammatory Treg cells. This phenotypic conversion leads to a domino-like immune response that is conducive to MS therapy. Overall, this work highlights a new pathway for accurate modulation of the phenotypes of adoptively transferred cells in situ, from proinflammatory to anti-inflammatory for MS therapy, and may be broadly applicable for patients suffering from other autoimmune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Multifunctional Interphase Layer Enabling Superior Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries under Ambient Temperature and &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional interphase consisting of disodium selenide and metal vanadium is developed for the Na anode via an in situ spontaneous chemical reaction. It possesses high sodiophilicity, strong mechanical strength, excellent ionic conductivity, and fast desolvation of solvated Na+, which can boost Na&#8208;ion adsorption and transport, realizing homogenous Na deposition without dendrites under ambient temperature and &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
The sodium (Na)&#8208;metal anode with high theoretical capacity and low cost is promising for construction of&#160;high&#8208;energy&#8208;density metal batteries. However, the unsatisfactory interface between Na and the liquid electrolyte induces tardy ion transfer kinetics and dendritic Na growth, especially at ultralow temperature (&#8722;40&#160;&#176;C). Herein, an artificial heterogeneous interphase consisting of disodium selenide (Na2Se) and metal vanadium (V) is produced on the surface of Na (Na@Na2Se/V) via an in situ spontaneous chemical reaction. Such interphase layer possesses high sodiophilicity, excellent ionic conductivity, and high Young's modulus, which can promote Na&#8208;ion adsorption and transport, realizing homogenous Na deposition without dendrites. The symmetric Na@Na2Se/V cell exhibits outstanding cycling life span of over 1790&#160;h (0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/1 mAh cm&#8722;2) in carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte. More remarkably, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the artificial Na2Se/V hybrid interphase can accelerate the desolvation of solvated Na+ at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. The Na@Na2Se/V electrode thus exhibits exceptional electrochemical performance in symmetric cell (over 1500&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/0.5 mAh cm&#8722;2) and full cell (over 700 cycles at 0.5 C) at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. This work provides an avenue to design artificial heterogeneous interphase layers for superior high&#8208;energy&#8208;density metal batteries at ambient and ultralow temperatures.

         <title>Electron Lifetime of Over One Month in Disordered Organic Solid&#8208;State Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultralong charge&#8208;carrier lifetime of more than one month in a disordered film of an organic semiconductor stored at room temperature is demonstrated. The charge carriers stored in the film are stabilized by spontaneous orientation polarization. It is also revealed that the charge carriers retain spatial information due to their slow diffusion in the plane of the organic layer.








Abstract
Understanding intrinsic carrier lifetime in disordered organic solid&#8208;state semiconductors is essential for improving device performance in not only molecule&#8208;based optoelectronic devices such as organic solar cells (OSC) but also photocatalysts used for producing solar fuel cells. Carriers in disordered films are generally thought to have short lifetimes on a scale ranging from nanoseconds to milliseconds. These short carrier lifetimes cause loss of charges in OSCs and low quantum yields in photocatalysts and impede the future application of organic semiconductors to, for example, charge&#8208;storage&#8208;based memory devices. This study reports an ultralong intrinsic carrier lifetime of more than one month in a disordered film of an organic semiconductor stored at room temperature without external power. This extraordinary lifetime, which is several orders of magnitude longer than that generally believed possible in conventional organic semiconductors, arises from carrier stabilization by spontaneous orientation polarization, excited spin&#8208;triplet recycling, and blocking of recombination processes in disordered films.

         <title>Microenvironmentally Responsive Chemotherapeutic Prodrugs and CHEK2 Inhibitors Self&#8208;Assembled Micelles: Protecting Fertility and Enhancing Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A co&#8208;delivery micelle (BML@PMP) that consists of a reduction&#8208;sensitive paclitaxel prodrug (PMP) for chemotherapy and a CHEK2 inhibitor (BML277) is developed for both fertility protection and chemotherapy enhancement. The BML@PMP micelles enhance the antitumor effect by delivering a high dose of paclitaxel to the tumor and inhibiting DNA damage repair, and prevent fertility damage by inhibiting the CHEK2&#8208;TAp63&#945; pathway in the ovary.








Abstract
Chemotherapy is a widely used and effective adjuvant treatment for cancer, and it has unavoidable damage to female fertility, with statistics showing 38% of women who have received chemotherapy are infertile. How to reduce fertility toxicity while enhancing the oncologic chemotherapy is a clinical challenge. Herein, co&#8208;delivery micelles (BML@PMP) are developed, which are composed of a reduction&#8208;sensitive paclitaxel prodrug (PMP) for chemotherapy and a CHEK2 inhibitor (BML277) for both fertility protection and chemotherapy enhancement. BML@PMP achieves fertility protection through three actions: (1) Due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, BML@PMP is more enriched in the tumor, while very little in the ovary (about 1/10th of the tumor). (2) Glutathione (GSH) triggers the release of PTX, and with low levels of GSH in the ovary, the amount of PTX released in the ovary is correspondingly reduced. (3) BML277 inhibits oocyte apoptosis by inhibiting the CHEK2&#8208;TAp63&#945; pathway. Because of the different downstream targets of CHEK2 in tumor cells and oocytes, BML277 also enhances chemotherapeutic efficacy by reducing DNA damage repair which is activated through the CHEK2 pathway. This bidirectional effect of CHEK2 inhibitor&#8208;based co&#8208;delivery system represents a promising strategy for improving oncology treatment indices and preventing chemotherapy&#8208;associated fertility damage.

         <title>Unlocking the Full Potential of Electron&#8208;Acceptor Molecules for Efficient and Stable Hole Injection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient and stable hole injection into organic semiconductors is realized by controlling the charged states of acceptor molecules. The high electron affinity of a neutral acceptor molecule enables direct hole injection even into materials used for a blue&#8208;emitting layer, and highly efficient, pure&#8208;blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with an extraordinarily low turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.67&#160;V are realized.








Abstract
Understanding the hole&#8208;injection mechanism and improving the hole&#8208;injection property are of pivotal importance in the future development of organic optoelectronic devices. Electron&#8208;acceptor molecules with high electron affinity (EA) are widely used in electronic applications, such as hole injection and p&#8208;doping. Although p&#8208;doping has generally been studied in terms of matching the ionization energy (IE) of organic semiconductors with the EA of acceptor molecules, little is known about the effect of the EA of acceptor molecules on the hole&#8208;injection property. In this work, the hole&#8208;injection mechanism in devices is completely clarified, and a strategy to optimize the hole&#8208;injection property of the acceptor molecule is developed. Efficient and stable hole injection is found to be possible even into materials with IEs as high as 5.8 eV by controlling the charged state of an acceptor molecule with an EA of about 5.0&#160;eV. This excellent hole&#8208;injection property enables direct hole injection into an emitting layer, realizing a pure blue organic light&#8208;emitting diode with an extraordinarily low turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.67&#160;V, a power efficiency of 29&#160;lm W&#8722;1, an external quantum efficiency of 28% and a Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage y coordinate of less than 0.10.

This excellent hole-injection property enables direct hole injection into an emitting layer, realizing a pure blue organic light-emitting diode with an extraordinarily low turn-on voltage of 2.67&#160;V, a power efficiency of 29&#160;lm W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, an external quantum efficiency of 28% and a Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; coordinate of less than 0.10.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>MXene&#8208;Nanoflakes&#8208;Enabled All&#8208;Optical Nonlinear Activation Function for On&#8208;Chip Photonic Deep Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new nanoflake 2D material MXene is designed for a neural network nonlinear broadband activator on a chip and realized using waveguide spectroscopy. The proposed configurations are reconfigurable and can therefore be adjusted for various applications without the need to modify the physical structure of the proposed MXene&#8208;based activator configurations via tuning the wavelength of operation.








Abstract
2D metal carbides and nitrides (MXene) are promising material platforms for on&#8208;chip neural networks owing to their nonlinear saturable absorption effect. The localized surface plasmon resonances in metallic MXene nanoflakes may play an important role in enhancing the electromagnetic absorption; however, their contribution is not determined due to the lack of a precise understanding of its localized surface plasmon behavior. Here, a saturable absorber made of MXene thin film and a silicon waveguide with MXene flakes overlayer are developed to perform neuromorphic tasks. The proposed configurations are reconfigurable and can therefore be adjusted for various applications without the need to modify the physical structure of the proposed MXene&#8208;based activator configurations via tuning the wavelength of operation. The capability and feasibility of the obtained results of machine&#8208;learning applications are confirmed via handwritten digit classification task, with near 99% accuracy. These findings can guide the design of advanced ultrathin saturable absorption materials on a chip for a broad range of applications.

         <title>Biohybrid 3D Printing of a Tissue&#8208;Sensor Platform for Wireless, Real&#8208;Time, and Continuous Monitoring of Drug&#8208;Induced Cardiotoxicity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biohybrid 3D printing method is introduced for the fabrication of tissue&#8208;sensor platforms. The integration of electronics with living cardiac tissues enables continuous monitoring of their contractile force and, ultimately, the drug&#8208;induced cardiotoxicity effects on cardiac tissues. It is expected that this method&#160;has the potential to become the next&#8208;generation technology in the field of tissue engineering for drug development.








Abstract
Drug&#8208;induced cardiotoxicity is regarded as a major hurdle in the early stages of drug development. Although there are various methods for preclinical cardiotoxicity tests, they cannot completely predict the cardiotoxic potential of a compound due to the lack of physiological relevance. Recently, 3D engineered heart tissue (EHT) has been used to investigate cardiac muscle functions as well as pharmacological effects by exhibiting physiological auxotonic contractions. However, there is still no adequate platform for continuous monitoring to test acute and chronic pharmacological effects in vitro. Here, a biohybrid 3D printing method for fabricating a tissue&#8208;sensor platform, composed of a bipillar&#8208;grafted strain gauge sensor and EHT, is first introduced. Two pillars are three&#8208;dimensionally printed as grafts onto a strain gauge&#8208;embedded substrate to promote the EHT contractility and guide the self&#8208;assembly of the EHTs along with the strain gauge. In addition, the integration of a wireless multi&#8208;channel electronic system allows for continuous monitoring of the EHT contractile force by the tissue&#8208;sensor platform and, ultimately, for the observation of the acute and chronic drug effects of cardiotoxicants. In summary, biohybrid 3D printing technology is expected to be a potential fabrication method to provide a next&#8208;generation tissue&#8208;sensor platform for an effective drug development process.

         <title>Toward the Speed Limit of Phase&#8208;Change Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The operation speeds of elemental Sb devices are explored by both&#160;theoretical calculations and experiments. It is directly demonstrated that the fastest speed of elemental Sb is &#8776;242&#160;ps, which is also the fastest operation speed as found among known phase&#8208;change memory.








Abstract
Phase&#8208;change memory (PCM) is one of the most promising candidates for next&#8208;generation data&#8208;storage technology, the programming speed of which has enhanced within a timescale from milliseconds to sub&#8208;nanosecond (&#8776;500 ps) through decades of effort. As the potential applications of PCM strongly depend on the switching speed, namely, the time required for the recrystallization of amorphous chalcogenide media, the finding of the ultimate crystallization speed is of great importance both theoretically and practically. In&#160;this&#160;work, through systematic analysis of discovered phase&#8208;change materials and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, elemental Sb&#8208;based PCM is predicted to have a superfast crystallization speed. Indeed, such cells experimentally present extremely fast crystallization speeds within 360&#160;ps. Remarkably, the recrystallization process is further sped up as the device shrinks, and a record&#8208;fast crystallization speed of only 242&#160;ps is achieved in 60&#160;nm&#8208;size devices. These findings open opportunities for dynamic random&#8208;access memory (DRAM)&#8208;like and even cache&#8208;like PCM using appropriate storage materials.

         <title>An Integrated Solar Panel with a Triboelectric Nanogenerator Array for Synergistic Harvesting of Raindrop&#160;and Solar Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A constructed integrated generator with a raindrop triboelectric nanogenerator (R&#8208;TENG) array and a solar panel can realize all&#8208;weather, complementary energy harvesting of raindrop and solar energy, and sustainable energy supply for the widely distributed sensors, which can promote the self&#8208;powered wireless environmental monitoring and the development of remote meteorological monitoring or smart farming, etc.








Abstract
The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is regarded as an effective strategy for harvesting energy from raindrops, and is a complementary solution with solar cells to achieve all&#8208;weather energy harvesting and sustainable energy supply. However, due to the irregularity of natural rainfalls in the volume, frequency, density, and location, designing high&#8208;efficiency raindrop TENG (R&#8208;TENG) arrays faces great challenges. In this work, a highly transparent, large&#8208;area, and high&#8208;efficiency R&#8208;TENG array with rational material choice, electrode structure, and array distribution is developed for efficiently harvesting irregular raindrop energy. The problem of electrical signal cancellation among adjacent raindrops can be fully avoided, as viewed from the high&#8208;resolution space&#8211;time analyses of high&#8208;speed camera and electrical signal characteristics. With the rationally designed electrode instead of multiple complex electrodes, all charges can be exported by the R&#8208;TENG array in a simulated irregular raindrop scenario. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the R&#8208;TENG possesses higher average power density (40.80&#160;mW m&#8722;2) than that of the solar cell (37.03&#160;mW m&#8722;2) in rainy condition. Additionally, a self&#8208;powered wireless light&#8208;intensity&#8208;monitoring system is demonstrated for real&#8208;time and all&#8208;day weather monitoring. This work provides useful guidance for designing high&#8208;efficiency TENG arrays integrated with solar panels for harvesting irregular raindrop energy and solar energy.

The cured products are reprocessed by imine metathesis and transesterification. Moreover, the imine group is chemically decomposed and resin recycling is achieved via recombination. Repeated reprocessing and recycling are realized, and the products exhibit excellent thermal and mechanical properties owing to their LC nature.








Abstract
The rapid increase in demand for recyclable and reusable thermosets has necessitated the development of materials with chemical structures that exhibit these features. Thus, functional mesogenic epoxide monomers bearing both ester and imine groups that can be vitrimerized and recycled are reported herein. The compounds show mesophase characteristics at 100&#8211;200&#160;&#176;C and can be converted into hard epoxides by a common curing reaction. The obtained hard epoxides have high isotropic thermal conductivity (&#8776;0.64 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1), which is derived from their highly ordered microstructures. The cured products can be easily reprocessed through imine metathesis and transesterification, and decomposed products can be obtained through imine hydrolysis under acidic or basic conditions and subsequently be re&#8208;cured. Surprisingly, recycled materials can be repeatedly reprocessed or chemically decomposed. The reprocessed materials retain the properties of their pristine counterparts, and the recycled products preserve the advantages of the hard thermosets without alteration to any of their unique properties. A dehydration reaction occurs between the residual hydroxyl groups during the re&#8208;hardening, which dramatically increases the glass transition temperature by &#8776;60&#160;&#176;C. These reprocessable and recyclable vitrimers demonstrate the effectiveness and environmental friendliness of the molecular design strategy reported herein.

         <title>Pyridinic Nitrogen Sites Dominated Coordinative Engineering of Subnanometric Pd Clusters for Efficient Alkynes&#8217; Semihydrogenation</title>

Pyridinic nitrogen&#8208;site&#8208;dominated coordinative engineering of subnanometric Pd clusters is proposed for efficient alkynes&#8217; semihydrogenation. The obtained catalyst Pd@PPy&#8208;600 exhibits excellent catalytic activity (99%) and selectivity (96%) for phenylacetylene semihydrogenation due to the abundant pyridinic nitrogen sites and interesting electron effects.








Abstract
Supported metal catalysts have played an important role in optimizing selective semihydrogenation of alkynes for fine chemicals. There into, nitrogen&#8208;doped carbons, as a type of promising support materials, have attracted extensive attentions. However, due to the general phenomenon of random doping for nitrogen species in the support, it is still atremendous challenge to finely identify which nitrogen configuration dominates the catalytic property of alkynes&#8217; semihydrogenation. Herein, it is reported that uniform mesoporous N&#8208;doped carbon spheres derived from mesoporous polypyrrole spheres are used as supports to immobilized subnanometric Pd clusters, which provide a particular platform to research the influence of nitrogen configurations on the alkynes&#8217; semihydrogenation. Comprehensive experimental results and density functional theory calculation indicate that pyridinic nitrogen configuration dominates the catalytic behavior of Pd clusters. The high contents of pyridinic nitrogen sites offer abundant coordination sites, which greatly reduces the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining reaction step and makes Pd clusters own high catalytic activity. The electron effect between pyridinic nitrogen sites and Pd clusters makes the reaction highly selective. Additionally, the good mesostructures also promote the fast transport of substrate. Based on the above, catalyst Pd@PPy&#8208;600 exhibits high catalytic activity (99%) and selectivity (96%) for phenylacetylene (C8H6) semihydrogenation.

         <title>Humidity&#8208;Insensitive, Large&#8208;Area&#8208;Applicable, Hot&#8208;Air&#8208;Assisted Ambient Fabrication of 2D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

A hot&#8208;air&#8208;assisted ambient fabrication technique is introduced to prepare 2D layered perovskite films for efficient and stable solar cells. This method is material&#8208;saving, humidity&#8208;insensitive, large&#8208;area&#8208;applicable, and adaptable for different 2D perovskites. High&#8208;quality 2D perovskite films are obtained with good crystallinity, preferable orientation, and desirable morphology.








Abstract
2D layered perovskites (LPs) have shown great potential to deliver high&#8208;performance photovoltaic devices with long&#8208;term stability. Despite many signs of progress being made in film quality and device performance, LP films are mainly processed in strict conditions and through non&#8208;scalable techniques. Here, the hot&#8208;air&#8208;assisted ambient fabrication technique is introduced to prepare LP films for efficient and stable solar cells. The high&#8208;quality LP films with good crystallinity, preferable orientation and desirable morphology are obtained by balancing the crystal nucleation and growth processes. Employing the synchrotron&#8208;based in situ grazing&#8208;incidence X&#8208;ray diffraction technique, hot air induces the solidification of solutes and forms an intermediate at the air&#8211;liquid interface, which transforms into 3D&#8208;like perovskite, followed by the growth of the 2D species toward the substrate. The optimal LP film delivers a device power conversion efficiency of 16.36%, the best value for the LP&#8208;based solar cells prepared by the non&#8208;spin&#8208;coating techniques. The solar cell performance is insensitive to the film processing humidity and the device size is upscalable, which promises real&#8208;world deployment of LP&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Toward Plasmonic Neural Probes: SERS Detection of Neurotransmitters through Gold&#8208;Nanoislands&#8208;Decorated Tapered Optical Fibers with Sub&#8208;10&#160;nm Gaps</title>

         <dc:description>
A surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy based neural probe that can detect neurotransmitters down to the micromolar range is presented. Striving for the development of minimally invasive neuroplasmonic probes providing highly sensitive biomolecular detection in the deep brain regions, a nonplanar repeated dewetting technique to fabricate gold nanoislands with sub&#8208;10 nm gaps around the entire tapered optical fiber surface is introduced.








Abstract
Integration of plasmonic nanostructures with fiber&#8208;optics&#8208;based neural probes enables label&#8208;free detection of molecular fingerprints via surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), and it represents a fascinating technological horizon to investigate brain function. However, developing neuroplasmonic probes that can interface with deep brain regions with minimal invasiveness while providing the sensitivity to detect biomolecular signatures in a physiological environment is challenging, in particular because the same waveguide must be employed for both delivering excitation light and collecting the resulting scattered photons. Here, a SERS&#8208;active neural probe based on a tapered optical fiber (TF) decorated with gold nanoislands (NIs) that can detect neurotransmitters down to the micromolar range is presented. To do this, a novel, nonplanar repeated dewetting technique to fabricate gold NIs with sub&#8208;10&#160;nm gaps, uniformly distributed on the wide (square millimeter scale in surface area), highly curved surface of TF is developed. It is experimentally and numerically shown&#160;that the amplified broadband near&#8208;field enhancement of the high&#8208;density NIs layer allows for achieving a limit of detection in aqueous solution of 10&#8722;7&#160;m for rhodamine 6G and 10&#8722;5&#160;m for serotonin and dopamine through SERS at near&#8208;infrared wavelengths. The NIs&#8208;TF technology is envisioned as a first step toward the unexplored frontier of in vivo label&#8208;free plasmonic neural interfaces.

         <title>Tunable Photochromism of Spirooxazine in the Solid State: A New Design Strategy Based on the Hypochromic Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy based on the hypochromic effect is proposed to develop photochromic spirooxazine in the solid state, and tunable solid photochromism for spirooxazine is realized under mild conditions.








Abstract
As an important organic photofunctional material, spirooxazine (SO) usually does not exhibit photochromism in the solid state since the intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking impedes photoisomerization. Developing photochromic SO in the solid state is crucial for practical applications but is still full of challenges. Here, a series of spirooxazine derivatives (SO1&#8211;SO4) with bulky aromatic substituents at the 4&#8208; and 7&#8208;positions of the skeleton, which provide them with a large volume with which to undergo solid&#8208;state photochromism under mild conditions, is designed and synthesized. All the compounds SO1&#8211;SO4 exhibit tunable solid photochromism without ground colors, excellent fatigue resistance, and high thermal stability. Notably, it takes only 15&#160;s for SO4 to reach the saturation of absorption intensity, thought to represent the fastest solid&#8208;state photoresponse of spirooxazines. X&#8208;ray crystal structures of the intermediate compound SO0 and the products SO1&#8211;SO2 as well as computational studies suggest that the bulky aromatic groups can lead to a hypochromic effect, allowing for the photochromism of SO in the solid state. The ideal photochromic properties of these spirooxazines open a new avenue for their applications in UV printing, quick response code, and related fields.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an important organic photofunctional material, spirooxazine (SO) usually does not exhibit photochromism in the solid state since the intermolecular &lt;i&gt;&#960;&#8211;&#960;&lt;/i&gt; stacking impedes photoisomerization. Developing photochromic SO in the solid state is crucial for practical applications but is still full of challenges. Here, a series of spirooxazine derivatives (&lt;b&gt;SO1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;SO4&lt;/b&gt;) with bulky aromatic substituents at the 4- and 7-positions of the skeleton, which provide them with a large volume with which to undergo solid-state photochromism under mild conditions, is designed and synthesized. All the compounds &lt;b&gt;SO1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;SO4&lt;/b&gt; exhibit tunable solid photochromism without ground colors, excellent fatigue resistance, and high thermal stability. Notably, it takes only 15&#160;s for &lt;b&gt;SO4&lt;/b&gt; to reach the saturation of absorption intensity, thought to represent the fastest solid-state photoresponse of spirooxazines. X-ray crystal structures of the intermediate compound &lt;b&gt;SO0&lt;/b&gt; and the products &lt;b&gt;SO1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;SO2&lt;/b&gt; as well as computational studies suggest that the bulky aromatic groups can lead to a hypochromic effect, allowing for the photochromism of SO in the solid state. The ideal photochromic properties of these spirooxazines open a new avenue for their applications in UV printing, quick response code, and related fields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stretchable Electrodes Based on Over&#8208;Layered Liquid Metal Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fabrication of thin films with liquid metal is proposed using thermal evaporation. The oxide film on the liquid metal surface forms a unique structure as indium/oxide/gallium (InOG). The oxide film helps form conductivity and exhibits negative piezoresistivity by rupturing. InOG electrode exhibits controllable electrical properties and mechanical stability. InOG overcomes the limitations of conventional applications through unique properties.








Abstract
Liquid metals are attractive materials for stretchable electronics owing to their high electrical conductivity and near&#8208;zero Young's modulus. However, the high surface tension of liquid metals makes it difficult to form films. A novel stretchable film is proposed based on an over&#8208;layered liquid&#8208;metal network. An intentionally oxidized interfacial layer helps to construct uninterrupted indium and gallium nanoclusters and produces additional electrical pathways between the two metal networks under mechanical deformation. The films exhibit gigantic negative piezoresistivity (G&#8208;NPR), which decreased the resistance up to 85% during the first 50% stretching. This G&#8208;NPR property is due to the rupture of the metal oxides, which allows the formation of liquid eutectic gallium&#8208;indium (EGaIn) and the connection of the over&#8208;layered networks to build new electrical paths. The electrodes exhibiting G&#8208;NPR are complementarily combined with conventional electrodes to amplify their performance or achieve some unique operations.

         <title>Printing on Particles: Combining Two&#8208;Photon Nanolithography and Capillary Assembly to Fabricate Multimaterial Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of the capillary assembly of colloidal particles and two&#8208;photon polymerization nanoprinting allows the easy integration of multiple functional materials into complex 1D, 2D, and 3D&#8208;microstructures. This flexible method enables the fabrication of wide range of microscale devices, from thermoresponsive microactuators, to magnetically controlled &#8220;micromachines,&#8221; which can selectively capture and release particles in solution.








Abstract
Additive manufacturing at the micro&#8208; and nanoscale has seen a recent upsurge to suit an increasing demand for more elaborate structures. However, the integration of multiple distinct materials at small scales remains challenging. To this end, capillarity&#8208;assisted particle assembly (CAPA) and two&#8208;photon polymerization direct laser writing (2PP&#8208;DLW) are combined to realize a new class of multimaterial microstructures. 2PP&#8208;DLW and CAPA both are used to fabricate 3D templates to guide the CAPA of soft&#8208; and hard colloids, and to link well&#8208;defined arrangements of functional microparticle arrays produced by CAPA, a process that is termed &#8220;printing on particles.&#8221; The printing process uses automated particle recognition algorithms to connect colloids into 1D, 2D, and 3D tailored structures, via rigid, soft, or responsive polymer links. Once printed and developed, the structures can be easily re&#8208;dispersed in water. Particle clusters and lattices of varying symmetry and composition are reported, together with thermoresponsive microactuators, and magnetically driven &#8220;micromachines&#8221;, which can efficiently move, capture, and release DNA&#8208;coated particles in solution. The flexibility of this method allows the combination of a wide range of functional materials into complex structures, which will boost the realization of new systems and devices for numerous fields, including microrobotics, micromanipulation, and metamaterials.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Engineering&#8208;Stabilized AgSbTe2 with High Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
p&#8208;Type AgSbTe2 materials stabilized with S and Se co&#8208;doping are demonstrated to exhibit an outstanding thermoelectric (TE) figure of merit zTmax of 2.3 and a unicouple device reaching energy conversion efficiencies up to 12.3% at a temperature difference of 370 K. This exceptional performance arises from an enhanced carrier density resulting from a higher concentration of silver vacancies, a vastly improved Seebeck coefficient enabled by the flattening of the valence band maximum and the inhibited formation of n&#8208;type Ag2Te.








Abstract
Thermoelectric (TE) generators enable the direct and reversible conversion between heat and electricity, providing applications in both refrigeration and power generation. In the last decade, several TE materials with relatively high figures of merit (zT) have been reported in the low&#8208; and high&#8208;temperature regimes. However, there is an urgent demand for high&#8208;performance TE materials working in the mid&#8208;temperature range (400&#8211;700 K). Herein, p&#8208;type AgSbTe2 materials stabilized with S and Se co&#8208;doping are demonstrated to exhibit an outstanding maximum figure of merit (zTmax) of 2.3 at 673 K and an average figure of merit (zTave) of 1.59 over the wide temperature range of 300&#8211;673 K. This exceptional performance arises from an enhanced carrier density resulting from a higher concentration of silver vacancies, a vastly improved Seebeck coefficient enabled by the flattening of the valence band maximum&#160;and the inhibited formation of n&#8208;type Ag2Te, and ahighly improved stability beyond 673 K. The optimized material is used to fabricate a single&#8208;leg device with efficiencies up to 13.3% and a unicouple TE device reaching energy conversion efficiencies up to 12.3% at a temperature difference of 370 K. These results highlight an effective strategy to engineer high&#8208;performance TE material in the mid&#8208;temperature range.

         <title>Regulating Surface Oxygen Activity by Perovskite&#8208;Coating&#8208;Stabilized Ultrahigh&#8208;Nickel Layered Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly active anionic redox in the ultrahigh&#8208;Ni layered oxide cathode is directly regulated by leveraging the stable oxygen vacancies/interstitials in a lithium and oxygen dual&#8208;ion conductor perovskite coating layer, which facilitates surface lithium&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics and electronic conductivity at the same time. This work provides an effective strategy for capacity versus stability juggling of the high&#8208;energy cathodes.








Abstract
Ultrahigh&#8208;Ni layered oxides are proposed as promising cathodes to fulfill the range demand of electric vehicles; yet, they are still haunted by compromised cyclability and thermal robustness. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art surface coating has been applied to solve the instability via blocking the physical contact between the electrolyte and the highly active Ni4+ ions on the cathode surface, but it falls short in handling the chemo&#8211;physical mobility of the oxidized lattice oxygen ions in the cathode. Herein, a direct regulation strategy is proposed to accommodate the highly active anionic redox within the solid phase. By leveraging the stable oxygen vacancies/interstitials in a lithium and oxygen dual&#8208;ion conductor (layered perovskite La4NiLiO8) coating layer, the reactivity of the surface lattice oxygen ion is dramatically restrained. As a result, the oxygen release from the lattice is suppressed, as well as the undesired irreversible phase transition and intergranular mechanical cracking. Meanwhile, the introduced dual&#8208;ion conductor can also facilitate lithium&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics and electronic conductivity on the particle surface. This work demonstrates that accommodating the anionic redox chemistry by dual&#8208;ion conductors is an effective strategy for capacity versus stability juggling of the high&#8208;energy cathodes.

         <title>Low&#8208;Coordination Trimetallic PtFeCo Nanosaws for Practical Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing highly efficient electrocatalysts with well&#8208;controlled nanostructure is significant for realizing the practical applications of fuel cells. In&#160;this&#160;work,&#160;a&#160;novel trimetallic platinum&#8211;iron&#8211;cobalt Pt3FeCo nanosaw with abundant defects and high&#8208;index edges&#160;is&#160;synthesized, reaching superior oxygen reduction reaction kinetics and fuel cell performances than commercial Pt/C. This work offers great inspiration for developing Pt&#8208;based multimetallic nanocatalysts in the future.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance catalysts for fuel cell catalysis is the most critical and challenging step for the commercialization of fuel cell technology. Here 1D&#160;trimetallic platinum&#8211;iron&#8211;cobalt nanosaws (Pt3FeCo NSs) with low&#8208;coordination features are designed as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for practical fuel cell catalysis. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of Pt3FeCo NSs (10.62&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 4.66 A mg&#8722;1Pt at 0.90&#160;V) is more than 25&#8208;folds higher than that of the commercial Pt/C, even after 30&#160;000 voltage cycles. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the strong inter&#8208;d&#8208;orbital electron transfer minimizes the ORR barrier with higher selectivity at robust valence states. The volcano correlation between the intrinsic structure featured with low&#8208;coordination Pt&#8208;sites and corresponding electronic activities is discovered, which guarantees high ORR activities. The Pt3FeCo NSs located in the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) also achieve very high peak power density (1800.6&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) and competitive specific/mass activities (1.79&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 0.79 A mg&#8722;1Pt at 0.90 ViR&#8208;free cell voltage) as well as a long&#8208;term lifetime in specific H2&#63743;O2 medium for proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells, ranking top electrocatalysts reported to date for MEA. This work represents a class of multimetallic Pt&#8208;based nanocatalysts for practical fuel cells and beyond.

         <title>Dressing Bacteria With a Hybrid Immunoactive Nanosurface to Elicit Dual Anticancer and Antiviral Immunity</title>

Approaches capable of simultaneously treating cancer and protecting susceptible patients from lethal infections, such as coronavirus disease 2019, are highly desirable but prove to be difficult. Here, dressing bacteria with a combination of a checkpoint blocking antibody and a virus&#8208;specific antigen is reported to elicit dual anticancer and antiviral immunity.








Abstract
Approaches capable of simultaneously treating cancer and protecting susceptible patients from lethal infections such as coronavirus disease 2019, are highly desirable but prove to be difficult. Here, dressing bacteria with a hybrid immunoactive nanosurface is reported to elicit dual anticancer and antiviral immunity. A combination of a checkpoint blocking antibody and a virus&#8208;specific antigen is covalently conjugated to polydopamine nanoparticles, which can be anchored onto bacterial surface, by a one&#8208;step in situ polymerization of dopamine under a cell&#8208;friendly condition. By virtue of the ability to colonize and penetrate deep tumor tissue, dressed bacteria enable sustained release and expanded exposure of carried immunoactivators to stimulate immune cells. In addition to a carrier role, bacteria are able to further provoke innate immunity due to the native immunogenicity of the pathogen&#8208;associated molecular patterns. Immunization with dressed bacteria promotes the maturation, and activation of antigen&#8208;presenting cells, which induces robust humoral and cellular immune responses in tumor&#8208;bearing mice. As evidenced by efficient production of viral&#8208;antigen&#8208;specific immunoglobulin G antibody in serum and significantly suppressed tumor growth in different models, dressing bacteria with a hybrid immunoactive nanosurface paves an avenue to prepare next&#8208;generation therapeutics for synergistic treatment and prevention.

         <title>Piezoelectric Actuation Mechanism Involving Extrinsic Nanodomain Dynamics in Lead&#8208;Free Piezoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The piezoelectric actuation mechanism in pseudocubic structures is clarified by the calculation of extrinsic/intrinsic contribution. Although only intrinsic contributes to the piezoelectricity, it does not match the piezoelectricity of BiFeO3&#8211;BaTiO3. It is clarified that extrinsic effect on nanodomain rearrangements is revealed in BiFeO3&#8211;BaTiO3. Extrinsic effect on nanodomain rearrangement is involved in the actuation mechanism of piezoelectricity.








Abstract
Piezoelectric materials play a key role in applications, while there are physically open questions. The physical origin of piezoelectricity is understood as the sum of contributions from intrinsic effects on lattice dynamics and those from extrinsic effects on ferroic&#8208;domain dynamics, but there is an incomplete understanding that all but intrinsic effects are classified as extrinsic effects. Therefore, the accurate classification of extrinsic effects is important for understanding&#160;the physical origin of piezoelectricity. In this work, high&#8208;energy synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray diffraction is utilized to measure the response of BiFeO3&#8722;BaTiO3 piezoelectrics and the intrinsic/extrinsic contribution to electric fields. It is found from crystal structure and intrinsic/extrinsic contribution, using the analysis involving structure refinement with various structural model and micromechanics&#8208;based calculations, that Bi3+&#8208;ion disordering is important for realization of piezoelectricity and nanodomains. Here, an extrinsic effect on the rearrangement of nanodomains is suggested. The nanodomains, which are formed by the locally distorted structure around the A&#8208;site by Bi&#8208;ion disordering, can significantly deform the material in the BiFeO3&#8722;BaTiO3 system, which contributes to the piezoelectric actuation mechanism apart from the extrinsic effect on ferroic&#8208;domain dynamics. Bi&#8208;ion disordering plays an important role in realizing piezoelectricity and nanodomains and can provide essential material design clues to develop next&#8208;generation Bi&#8208;based lead&#8208;free piezoelectric ceramics.

         <title>From Heterostructures to Solid&#8208;Solutions: Structural Tunability in Mixed Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The degree of ion mixing in multicomponent perovskite crystals is a key factor for the stability and performance of optoelectronic devices but remains challenging to control. In this work, a new method, termed evaporation&#8211;crystallization polymer pen lithography, is used to synthesize and systematically study libraries of halide perovskite crystals (Cs1&#8722;xFAxPbX3, where X = halide anion) and reveals strategies for deliberately controlling ion segregation behavior in these materials.








Abstract
The stability, reliability, and performance of halide&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based devices depend upon the structure, composition, and particle size of the device&#8208;enabling materials. Indeed, the degree of ion mixing in multicomponent perovskite crystals, although challenging to control, is a key factor in determining properties. Herein, an emerging method termed evaporation&#8211;crystallization polymer pen lithography is used to synthesize and systematically study the degree of ionic mixing of Cs0.5FA0.5PbX3 (FA = formamidinium; X = halide anion, ABX3) crystals, as a function of size, temperature, and composition. These experiments have led to the discovery of a heterostructure morphology where the A&#8208;site cations, Cs and FA, are segregated into the core and edge layers, respectively. Simulation and experimental results indicate that the heterostructures form as a consequence of a combination of both differences in solubility of the two ions in solution and the enthalpic preference for Cs&#8211;FA ion segregation. This preference for segregation can be overcome to form a solid&#8208;solution by decreasing crystal size (&lt;60&#160;nm) or increasing temperature. Finally, these tools are utilized to identify and synthesize solid&#8208;solution nanocrystals of Cs0.5FA0.5Pb(Br/I)3 that significantly suppress photoinduced anion migration compared to their bulk counterparts, offering a route to deliberately designed photostable optoelectronic materials.

         <title>Electrical Manipulation of Topological Phases in a Quantum Anomalous Hall Insulator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;gated Cr&#8208;doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 magnetic topological insulator devices are fabricated by combining molecular beam epitaxial growth and&#160;2D transfer methods. The large gate&#8208;tunability using mica as the gate dielectric leads to the observation of the reversible transition between two distinct topological phases, namely the quantum anomalous Hall and the anomalous Hall insulator, via electric field tuning.








Abstract
Quantum anomalous Hall phases arising from the inverted band topology in magnetically doped topological insulators have emerged as an important subject of research for quantization at zero magnetic fields. Though necessary for practical implementation, sophisticated electrical control of molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)&#8208;grown quantum anomalous Hall matter have been stymied by growth and fabrication challenges. Here, a novel procedure is demonstrated, employing a combination of thin&#8208;film deposition and 2D&#160;material stacking techniques, to create dual&#8208;gated devices of the MBE&#8208;grown quantum anomalous Hall insulator, Cr&#8208;doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3. In these devices, orthogonal control over the field&#8208;induced charge density and the electric displacement field is demonstrated. A thorough examination of material responses to tuning along each control axis is presented, realizing magnetic property control along the former and a novel capability to manipulate the surface exchange gap along the latter. Through electrically addressing the exchange gap, the capabilities to either strengthen the quantum anomalous Hall state or suppress it entirely and drive a topological phase transition to a trivial state are demonstrated. The experimental result is explained using first principle theoretical calculations, and establishes a practical route for in situ control of quantum anomalous Hall states and topology.

         <title>Tuning of Polar Domain Boundaries in Nonpolar Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Domain boundaries with macroscopic polarity are discovered in a nonpolar PbZrO3&#8208;based single crystal. They can be preferentially created and erased by applying a small stress. The polarity can be enhanced or switched with a small electric field. Atomistic&#8208;structural analysis reveals that the polar domains boundaries are formed by a combination of &#8593;&#8593;&#8595;&#8208;like ferrielectric structures.








Abstract
Domain boundaries in ferroic materials are found to have various physical properties not observed in the surrounding domains. Such differences can be enhanced and bring promising functionalities when centrosymmetric nonpolar materials encounter polar domain boundaries. In this work, a tunable polar domain boundary is discovered in an antiferroelectric single crystal. Under a small stress or electric field, the density, volume, and polarity of the boundaries are successfully controlled.

         <title>Reshaping de Novo Protein Switches into Bioresponsive Materials for Biomarker, Toxin, and Viral Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining regenerated silk fibroin and de novo protein switches enables the design of a variety of sensing interfaces that have long shelf life and are highly sensitive and specific to numerous analytes such as pathogens, viruses, cancer markers, and toxins.








Abstract
De novo designed protein switches are powerful tools to specifically and sensitively detect diverse targets with simple chemiluminescent readouts. Finding an appropriate material host for de novo designed protein switches without altering their thermodynamics while preserving their intrinsic stability over time would enable the development of a variety of sensing formats to monitor exposure to pathogens, toxins, and for disease diagnosis. Here, a de novo protein&#8208;biopolymer hybrid that maintains the detection capabilities induced by the conformational change of the incorporated proteins&#160;in response to analytes of interest is generated in multiple, shelf&#8208;stable material formats without the need of refrigerated storage conditions. A set of functional demonstrator devices including personal protective equipment such as masks and laboratory gloves, free&#8208;standing films, air quality monitors, and wearable devices is presented to illustrate the versatility of the approach. Such formats are designed to be responsive to human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2), anti&#8208;hepatitis B (HBV) antibodies, Botulinum neurotoxin B (BoNT/B), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2). This combination of form and function offers wide opportunities for ubiquitous sensing in multiple environments by enabling a large class of bio&#8208;responsive interfaces of broad utility.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Narrowband Near&#8208;Infrared Responsive J&#8208;Aggregates of Fused Quinoidal Tetracyanoindacenodithiophene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of J&#8208;aggregates based on quinoidal indacenodithiophenes are reported with an ultra&#8208;narrow bandwidth (full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum, FWHM&#160;=&#160;22&#160;nm) absoprtion peak located at 770&#160;nm. A combination of excited&#8208;state lifetime measurements and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements are employed to probe their J&#8208;aggregate behavior. NIR phototransistors exhibit consistent photoresponse throughout the illumination intensity range at selective wavelength.








Abstract
Narrowband photoresponsive molecules are highly coveted in high&#8208;resolution imaging, sensing, and monochromatic photodetection, especially those extending into the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral range. Here, a new class of J&#8208;aggregating materials based on quinoidal indacenodithiophenes (IDTs) that exhibit an ultra&#8208;narrowband (full width half maxima of 22&#160;nm) NIR absorption peak centered at 770&#160;nm is reported. The spectral width is readily tuned by the length of the solubilizing alkyl group, with longer chains resulting in significant spectral narrowing. The J&#8208;aggregate behavior is confirmed by a combination of excited state lifetime measurements and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements. Their utility as electron&#8208;transporting materials is demonstrated in both transistor and phototransistor devices, with the latter demonstrating good response at NIR wavelengths (780&#160;nm) over a range of intensities.

         <title>Direct CO2 Capture by Alkali&#8208;Dissolved Cellulose and Sequestration in Building Materials and Artificial Reef Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkali cellulose solutions are used as CO2 absorption media to lead mineralized cellulose materials at a tailorable cellulose&#8208;to&#8208;mineral ratio. Cellulose lean gels are converted into dry powders, shown as a functional component of ceramic glazes and cementitious composites; meanwhile, cellulose&#8208;rich gels are moldable and extrudable, yielding stone&#8208;like structures tested as artificial substrates for coral reef restoration.








Abstract
Current carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technologies require high energy input and costly catalysts. Here, an effective pathway is offered that addresses climate action by atmospheric CO2 sequestration. Industrially relevant highly reactive alkali cellulose solutions are used as CO2 absorption media. The latter lead to mineralized cellulose materials (MCM) at a tailorable cellulose&#8208;to&#8208;mineral ratio, forming organic&#8208;inorganic viscous systems (viscosity from 102 to 107&#160;mPa&#160;s and storage modulus from 10 to 105&#160;Pa). CO2 absorption and conversion into calcium carbonate and associated minerals translate to maximum absorption of 6.5&#160;gCO2 gcellulose&#8722;1, tracking inversely with cellulose loading. Cellulose lean gels are easily converted into dry powders, shown as a functional component of ceramic glazes and cementitious composites. Meanwhile, cellulose&#8208;rich gels are moldable and extrudable, yielding stone&#8208;like structures tested as artificial substrates for coral reef restoration. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) suggests new CCU opportunities for building materials, as demonstrated in underwater deployment for coral reef ecosystem restoration.

The latter lead to mineralized cellulose materials (MCM) at a tailorable cellulose-to-mineral ratio, forming organic-inorganic viscous systems (viscosity from 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;mPa&#160;s and storage modulus from 10 to 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;Pa). CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; absorption and conversion into calcium carbonate and associated minerals translate to maximum absorption of 6.5&#160;gCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; g&lt;sub&gt;cellulose&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, tracking inversely with cellulose loading. Cellulose lean gels are easily converted into dry powders, shown as a functional component of ceramic glazes and cementitious composites. Meanwhile, cellulose-rich gels are moldable and extrudable, yielding stone-like structures tested as artificial substrates for coral reef restoration. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) suggests new CCU opportunities for building materials, as demonstrated in underwater deployment for coral reef ecosystem restoration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Actively Triggerable Metals via Liquid Metal Embrittlement for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Actively triggerable metals for biomedical applications combine the advantageous functional properties of metals with precise lifetime control. In this work, a biocompatible liquid metal is formulated into stimuli that can successfully trigger the on&#8208;demand and programmable breakdown of aluminum within different physiologically relevant environments. Additionally, three use cases for actively triggerable metals in biomedical devices are presented.








Abstract
Actively triggerable materials, which break down upon introduction of an exogenous stimulus, enable precise control over the lifetime of biomedical technologies, as well as adaptation to unforeseen circumstances, such as changes to an established treatment plan. Yet, most actively triggerable materials are low&#8208;strength polymers and hydrogels with limited long&#8208;term durability. By contrast, metals possess advantageous functional properties, including high mechanical strength and conductivity, that are desirable across several applications within biomedicine. To realize actively triggerable metals, a mechanism called liquid metal embrittlement is leveraged, in which certain liquid metals penetrate the grain boundaries of certain solid metals and cause them to dramatically weaken or disintegrate. In this work, it is demonstrated that eutectic gallium indium (EGaIn), a biocompatible alloy of gallium, can be formulated to reproducibly trigger the breakdown of aluminum within different physiologically relevant environments. The breakdown behavior of aluminum after triggering can further be readily controlled by manipulating its grain structure. Finally, three possible use cases of biomedical devices constructed from actively triggerable metals are demonstrated.

         <title>Understanding Self&#8208;Assembly of Silica&#8208;Precipitating Peptides to Control Silica Particle Morphology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic silaffin&#8208;based peptides give rise to different template structures depending on stereochemistry and connectivity of the central residue. NMR experiments help to decipher the peptidic template structures. The resulting structure&#8211;activity relationship provides a key to rationally control the assembly of such peptides and thereby the resulting silica material as the peptidic precursor structures determine the materials final architecture.








Abstract
The most advanced materials are those found in nature. These evolutionary optimized substances provide highest efficiencies, e.g., in harvesting solar energy or providing extreme stability, and are intrinsically biocompatible. However, the mimicry of biological materials is limited to a few successful applications since there is still a lack of the tools to recreate natural materials. Herein, such means are provided based on a peptide library derived from the silaffin protein R5 that enables rational biomimetic materials design. It is now evident that biomaterials do not form via mechanisms observed in vitro. Instead, the material's function and morphology are predetermined by precursors that self&#8208;assemble in solution, often from a combination of protein and salts. These assemblies act as templates for biomaterials. The RRIL peptides used here are a small part of the silica&#8208;precipitation machinery in diatoms. By connecting RRIL motifs via varying central bi&#8208; or trifunctional residues, a library of stereoisomers is generated, which allows characterization of different template structures in the presence of phosphate ions by combining residue&#8208;resolved real&#8208;time NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Understanding these templates in atomistic detail, the morphology of silica particles is controlled via manipulation of the template precursors.

Given their low&#8208;temperature solution processability and mechanical flexibility, organic field&#8208;effect transistors are promising candidates for developing Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things technologies and realizing next&#8208;generation wearable applications. Here, the authors compare the performance of flexible transistors with the emerging vertical&#8208;transistor technology, outline the critical device fabrication and material&#8208;design strategies, and discuss their role and function in a wide range of flexible electronics applications.








Abstract
The development of flexible and conformable devices, whose performance can be maintained while being continuously deformed, provides a significant step toward the realization of next&#8208;generation wearable and e&#8208;textile applications. Organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) are particularly interesting for flexible and lightweight products, because of their low&#8208;temperature solution processability, and the mechanical flexibility of organic materials that endows OFETs the natural compatibility with plastic and biodegradable substrates. Here, an in&#8208;depth review of two competing flexible OFET technologies, planar and vertical OFETs (POFETs and VOFETs, respectively) is provided. The electrical, mechanical, and physical properties of POFETs and VOFETs are critically discussed, with a focus on four pivotal applications (integrated logic circuits, light&#8208;emitting devices, memories, and sensors). It is pointed out that the flexible function of the relatively newer VOFET technology, along with its perspective on advancing the applicability of flexible POFETs, has not been reviewed so far, and the direct comparison regarding the performance of POFET&#8208; and VOFET&#8208;based flexible applications is most likely absent. With discussions spanning printed and wearable electronics, materials science, biotechnology, and environmental monitoring, this contribution is a clear stimulus to researchers working in these fields to engage toward the plentiful possibilities that POFETs and VOFETs offer to flexible electronics.

         <title>Recent Research Progress of Organic Small&#8208;Molecule Semiconductors with High Electron Mobilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the structural modification strategies of organic small&#8208;molecule semiconductors with high electron mobilities, a promising candidate for the construction of next&#8208;generation complementary organic logic&#8208;digital circuits, to achieve chemical stability and high electron transport properties. In addition, the applications of n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule semiconductor materials based on high mobility in organic electronic devices, such as organic field&#8208;effect transistors, organic light&#8208;emitting transistors, organic photodetectors, and gas sensors, are introduced.








Abstract
Organic electronics has made great progress in the past decades, which is inseparable from the innovative development of organic electronic devices and the diversity of organic semiconductor materials. It is worth mentioning that both of these great advances are inextricably linked to the development of organic high&#8208;performance semiconductor materials, especially the representative n&#8208;type organic small&#8208;molecule semiconductor materials with high electron mobilities. The n&#8208;type organic small molecules have the advantages of simple synthesis process, strong intermolecular stacking, tunable molecular structure, and easy to functionalize structures. Furthermore, the n&#8208;type semiconductor is a remarkable and important component for constructing complementary logic circuits and p&#8208;n heterojunction structures. Therefore, n&#8208;type organic semiconductors play an extremely important role in the field of organic electronic materials and are the basis for the industrialization of organic electronic functional devices. This review focuses on the modification strategies of organic small molecules with high electron mobility at molecular level, and discusses in detail the applications of n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule semiconductor materials with high mobility in organic field&#8208;effect transistors, organic light&#8208;emitting transistors, organic photodetectors, and gas sensors.

         <title>Hierarchical Composite Self&#8208;Sorted Supramolecular Gel Noodles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicomponent assembly of 2NapFF with the structurally similar functionalized dipeptide 2NapLG causes changes to the formed first&#8208;order supramolecular structures. These changes to assembly allow access to new properties and behaviors. This multicomponent system can be used to form mechanically robust supramolecular noodles. Through a change in external conditions (a reduction in pH), crystals can be formed within these noodles.








Abstract
Multicomponent supramolecular systems can be used to achieve different properties and new behaviors compared to their corresponding single component systems. Here, a two&#8208;component system is used, showing that a non&#8208;gelling component modifies the assembly of the gelling component, allowing access to co&#8208;assembled structures that cannot be formed from the gelling component alone. The systems are characterized across multiple length scales, from the molecular level by NMR and CD spectroscopy to the microstructure level by SANS and finally to the material level using nanoindentation and rheology. By exploiting the enhanced mechanical properties achieved through addition of the second component, multicomponent noodles are formed with superior mechanical properties to those formed by the single&#8208;component system. Furthermore, the non&#8208;gelling component can be triggered to crystallize within the multicomponent noodles, allowing the preparation of new types of hierarchical composite noodles.

         <title>B&#63743;N&#8208;Bond&#8208;Embedded Triplet Terpolymers with Small Singlet&#8211;Triplet Energy Gaps for Suppressing Non&#8208;Radiative Recombination and Improving Blend Morphology in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of terpolymers are developed by introducing the B&#63743;N bond into the polymer chain of PM6, which lowers the HOMO level, reduces the &#916;EST, and optimizes the morphology of the active blend, contributing to a high PCE of 19.02% with reduced Eloss and charge recombination.








Abstract
Suppressing the photon energy loss (Eloss), especially the non&#8208;radiative loss, is of importance to further improve the device performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, typical &#960;&#8208;conjugated semiconductors possess a large singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST), leading to a lower triplet state than charge transfer state and contributing to a non&#8208;radiative loss channel of the photocurrent by the triplet state. Herein, a series of triplet polymer donors are developed by introducing a BNIDT block into the PM6 polymer backbone. The high electron affinity of BNIDT and the opposite resonance effect of the B&#63743;N bond in BNIDT results in a lowered highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and a largely reduced &#916;EST. Moreover, the morphology of the active blends is also optimized by fine&#8208;tuning the BNIDT content. Therefore, non&#8208;radiative recombination via the terminal triplet loss channels and morphology traps is effectively suppressed. The PNB&#8208;3 (with 3% BNIDT):L8&#8208;BO device exhibits both small &#916;EST and optimized morphology, favoring more efficient charge transfer and transport. Finally, the simultaneously enhanced Voc of 0.907&#160;V, Jsc of 26.59&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and FF of 78.86% contribute to a champion PCE of 19.02%. Therefore, introducing B&#63743;N bonds into benchmark polymers is a possible avenue toward higher&#8208;performance of OSCs.

         <title>Band Engineering of the Second Phase to Reach High Thermoelectric Performance in Cu2Se&#8208;Based Composite Material</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The band energy of the second phase is proposed to diminish the electric scattering caused by nanophase incorporation. It realizes similar electronic structures and different phonon structures between the Cu2Se and dispersed nano&#8208;Cu2Se0.88S0.06Te0.06, which maintain a high power factor and suppress the thermal conductivity, resulting in a figure of merit (zT) value of 2.34 at 850 K.








Abstract
Hitherto, Cu2Se incorporated with a dispersed second phase shows extremely low thermal conductivity and excellent thermoelectric properties. However, the significant mismatch in electronic band structure between the second phases and the matrix often causes a deterioration of carrier mobility. In this work, based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the electronic band structure of the second phase is adjusted through doping S and Te. It is found that Cu2Se0.88S0.06Te0.06 has a highly similar electronic band structure to the Cu2Se matrix, which results in high carrier mobility and power factor in Cu2Se&#8208;based composite materials. Additionally, the dispersed second&#8208;phase Cu2Se0.88S0.06Te0.06, dislocations, and nanograins are observed in the Cu2Se/5 wt% Cu2Se0.88S0.06Te0.06 product, which leads to a substantial reduction in the thermal conductivity. Finally, high figure of merit (zT) values of 2.04 (by Dulong&#8211;Petit heat capacity) and 2.34 (by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) measured heat capacity) are achieved at 850 K, which are about 65% higher than that of Cu2Se in this work and comparable to the recently reported p&#8208;type Cu2Se with outstanding performance.

         <title>The transition from Elasto&#8208;Hydrodynamic to Mixed Regimes in Lubricated Friction of Soft Solid Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lubrication regime transition from the elasto&#8208;hydrodynamic lubrication (EHL)&#160;regime to the mixed lubrication (ML) regime for soft solids can happen when the lubricant film thickness is much larger than the substrate surface roughness. During sliding, wave&#8208;like undulations are observed, accompanied by fingering instabilities at the trailing edge. These instabilities are closely related to the lubrication regime transition.








Abstract
Lubricated contacts in soft materials are common in various engineering and natural settings, such as tires, haptic applications, contact lenses, and the fabrication of soft electronic devices. Two major regimes are elasto&#8208;hydrodynamic lubrication (EHL), in which solid surfaces are fully separated by a fluid film, and mixed lubrication (ML), in which there is partial solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid contact. The transition between these regimes governs the minimum sliding friction achievable and is thus very important. Generally, the transition from EHL to ML regimes is believed to occur when the thickness of the lubricant layer is comparable with the amplitude of surface roughness. Here, it is reported that in lubricated sliding experiments on smooth, soft, poly(dimethylsiloxane) substrates, the transition can occur when the thickness of the liquid layer is much larger than the height of the asperities. Direct visualization of the &#8220;contact&#8221; region shows that the transition corresponds to the formation of wave&#8208;like surface wrinkles at the leading contact edge and associated instabilities at the trailing contact edge, which are believed to trigger the transition to the mixed regime. These results change the understanding of what governs the important EHL&#8211;ML transition in the lubricated sliding of soft solids.

         <title>Organic Synthetic Photonic Systems with Reconfigurable Parity&#8211;Time Symmetry Breaking for Tunable Single&#8208;Mode Microlasers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic photonic material system with reconfigurable parity&#8211;time (PT) symmetry breaking is proposed theoretically and realized experimentally. The composite system of functional organic molecules is deliberately designed and processed into reconfigurable PT symmetric microcavities. The molecular photoisomerization process reconfigures the PT symmetry breaking in the organic microcavity system, allowing for a record&#8208;breaking tunable single&#8208;mode laser performance.








Abstract
Synthetic photonic materials exploiting the quantum concept of parity&#8211;time (PT) symmetry lead to an emerging photonic paradigm&#8212;non&#8208;Hermitian photonics, which is revolutionizing the photonic sciences. The non&#8208;Hermitian photonics dealing with the interplay between gain and loss in PT synthetic photonic material systems offers a versatile platform for advancing microlaser technology.

&lt;p&gt;A synthetic photonic material system with reconfigurable parity&#8211;time (PT) symmetry breaking is proposed theoretically and realized experimentally. The composite system of functional organic molecules is deliberately designed and processed into reconfigurable PT symmetric microcavities. The molecular photoisomerization process reconfigures the PT symmetry breaking in the organic microcavity system, allowing for a record-breaking tunable single-mode laser performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synthetic photonic materials exploiting the quantum concept of parity&#8211;time (PT) symmetry lead to an emerging photonic paradigm&#8212;non-Hermitian photonics, which is revolutionizing the photonic sciences. The non-Hermitian photonics dealing with the interplay between gain and loss in PT synthetic photonic material systems offers a versatile platform for advancing microlaser technology. However, current PT-symmetric microcavity laser systems only manipulate imaginary parts of the refractive indices, suffering from limited laser spectral bandwidth. Here, an organic composite material system is proposed to synthesize reconfigurable PT-symmetric microcavities with controllable complex refractive indices for realizing tunable single-mode laser outputs. A grayscale electron-beam direct-writing technique is elaborately designed to process laser dye-doped polymer films in one single step into microdisk cavities with periodic gain and loss distribution, which enables thresholdless PT-symmetry breaking and single-mode laser operation. Furthermore, organic photoisomerizable compounds are introduced to reconfigure the PT-symmetric systems in real-time by tailoring the real refractive index of the polymer microresonators, allowing for a dynamically and continuously tunable single-mode laser output. This work fundamentally enhances the PT-symmetric photonic systems for innovative design of synthetic photonic materials and architectures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reaction Site Designation by Intramolecular Electric Field in Tr&#246;ger's&#8208;Base&#8208;Derived Conjugated Microporous Polymer for Near&#8208;Unity Selectivity of CO2 Photoconversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rigid V&#8208;shaped configured Tr&#246;ger's base is introduced to the construction of a covalent microporous polymer. Superior CO2 adsorption/activation capacity and an intramolecular electric field of the polymer are demonstrated. The carrier&#8208;recombination suppression and reaction&#8208;site designation from the synergy of the conjugated network and intramolecular electric field result in a remarkable photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance with approximately unity CO selectivity.








Abstract
To facilitate solar&#8208;driven overall CO2 and H2O convsersion into fuels and O2, a series of covalent microporous polymers derived from Tr&#246;ger's base are synthesized featuring flexural backbone and unusual charge&#8208;transfer properties. The incorporation of rigid structural twist Tr&#246;ger's base unit grants the polymers enhanced microporosity and CO2 adsorption/activation capacity. Density function theory calculations and photo&#8208;electrochemical analyses reveal that an electric dipole moment (from negative to positive) directed to the Tr&#246;ger's base unit is formed across two obliquely opposed molecular fragments and induces an intramolecular electric field. The Tr&#246;ger's base unit located at folding point becomes an electron trap to attract photogenerated electrons in the molecular network, which brings about suppression of carrier recombination and designates the reaction site in synergy with the conjugated network. In response to the discrepancy in reaction pathways across the reaction sites, the product allocation in the catalytic reaction is thereby regulated. Optimally, CMP&#8208;nTB achieves the highest photocatalytic CO production of 163.53&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with approximately unity selectivity, along with H2O oxidation to O2 in the absence of any photosensitizer or co&#8208;catalyst. This work provides new insight for developing specialized artificial organic photocatalysts.

         <title>Porous Organic Polymer with Hierarchical Structure and Limited Volume Expansion for Ultrafast and Highly Durable Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing sustainable organic electrode materials with high&#8208;rate capability and satisfactory cycle lifespan is one of the key parameters for exploiting the next&#8208;generation sodium&#8208;ion batteries at practical levels. In this work, a facile polymerization strategy is developed for preparing a porous organic polymer with a hierarchical structure and limited volume expansion that enables ultrafast and highly durable sodium storage.








Abstract
Sustainable organic electrode materials, as promising alternatives to conventional inorganic electrode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), are still challenging to realize long&#8208;lifetime and high&#8208;rate batteries because of their poor conductivity, limited electroactivity, and severe dissolution. It is also urgent to deeply reveal their electrochemical mechanism and evolution processes. A porous organic polymer (POP) with a conjugated and hierarchical structure is designed and synthesized here. The unique molecule and structure endow the POP with electron delocalization, high ionic diffusivity, plentiful active sites, exceptional structure stability, and limited solubility in electrolytes. When evaluated as an anode for SIBs, the POP exhibits appealing electrochemical properties regarding reversible capacity, rate behaviors, and long&#8208;duration life. Importantly, using judiciously combined experiments and theoretical computation, including in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and ex situ spectroscopy,&#160;we&#160;reveal the Na&#8208;storage mechanism and dynamic evolution processes of the POP, including 12&#8208;electron reaction process with Na, low volume expansion (125&#8211;106% vs the initial 100%), and stable composition and structure evolution during repeating sodiation/de&#8208;sodiation processes. This quantitative design for ultrafast and highly durable sodium storage in the POP could be of immediate benefit for the rational design of organic electrode materials with ideal electrochemical properties.

         <title>DNA Nanoclusters Combined with One&#8208;Shot Radiotherapy Augments&#160;Cancer Immunotherapy Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmable CpG DNA nanocluster termed as DNAnc loads &#8776;8125 copies of CpG ODNs in a single nanoparticle. It efficiently repolarizes macrophages from an M2&#8208;like phenotype into an M1&#8208;like phenotype to elicit a robust abscopal effect, which successfully stimulates CD8+&#8208;T&#8208;cells&#8208;mediated suppression of tumor growth, metastasis, and recurrence after one&#8208;shot radiotherapy.








Abstract
Immunotherapy shows immense promise for improving cancer treatment. Combining immunotherapy with radiotherapy provides a conspicuous advantage due to its enhanced abscopal effect. However, established immune tolerance mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment can hamper the generation of a sufficient abscopal effect. Herein, a type of DNA nanocluster (DNAnc) that is self&#8208;assembled by a CpG&#8208;ODNs&#8208;loaded Y&#8208;shaped double&#8208;stranded DNA vector based on the unique complementary base&#8208;pairing rules is designed. The unique structure of DNAnc makes it load more than &#8776;8125.5 &#177; 822.5 copies of CpG ODNs within one single nanostructure, which effectively increases resistance to nuclease degradation and elevates the efficiency of repolarizing macrophages to an M1&#8208;like phenotype. Mechanistic studies reveal that more DNAncs are endocytosed by macrophages in the cancer tissue and repolarized macrophages to elicit a robust abscopal effect with the accumulation of macrophages induced by radiotherapy, generating potent, long&#8208;term, and durable antitumor immunity for the inhibition of tumor metastasis and the prevention of tumor recurrence, which provides a novel strategy to boost cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Strongly Correlated Exciton&#8208;Magnetization System for Optical Spin Pumping in CrBr3 and CrI3.</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chromium trihalides are considered canonical two&#8208;dimensional ferromagnets. The emergent magnetization is coupled with the photoexcited excitons via exchange interactions. Despite chemical and structural similarities, the nature of this coupling is qualitatively different between CrBr3 and CrI3. The opposite sign of the hole&#8208;magnetization coupling enables realization of optical spin pumping in CrBr3, revealing the origin of ferromagnetic hysteresis in photoluminescence experiments.








Abstract
Ferromagnetism in van der Waals systems, preserved down to a monolayer limit, attracted attention to a class of materials with general composition CrX3 (X=I, Br, and Cl), which are treated now as canonical 2D ferromagnets. Their diverse magnetic properties, such as different easy axes or varying and controllable character of in&#8208;plane or interlayer ferromagnetic coupling, make them promising candidates for spintronic, photonic, optoelectronic, and other applications. Still, significantly different magneto&#8208;optical properties between the three materials have been presenting a challenging puzzle for researchers over the last few years. Herewith, it is demonstrated that despite similar structural and magnetic configurations, the coupling between excitons and magnetization is qualitatively different in CrBr3 and CrI3 films. Through a combination of the optical spin pumping experiments with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art theory describing bound excitonic states in the presence of magnetization, we&#160;concluded that the hole&#8208;magnetization coupling has the opposite sign in CrBr3 and CrI3 and also between the ground and excited exciton state. Consequently, efficient spin pumping capabilities are demonstrated in CrBr3 driven by magnetization via spin&#8208;dependent absorption, and the different origins of the magnetic hysteresis in CrBr3 and CrI3 are unraveled.

         <title>Optimizing the Fermi Level of a 3D Current Collector with Ni3S2/Ni3P Heterostructure for Dendrite&#8208;Free Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on theoretical simulation, the Ni3S2/Ni3P heterostructure on 3D porous nickel foam (Ni3S2/Ni3P@NF) with high work function is developed as a current collector for dendrite&#8208;free sodium&#8208;metal anodes. The excellent electrochemical performance of Ni3S2/Ni3P@NF@Na can be attributed to enhanced sodiophilicity, fast ion&#8208;transport kinetics, and uniform solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase structures.








Abstract
Rechargeable sodium&#8208;metal batteries (RSMBs) with high energy density and low cost are attracting extensive attention as promising energy&#8208;storage technologies. However, the poor cyclability and safety issues caused by unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) structure and dendrite issues limit their practical application. Herein, it is theoretically predicted that constructing the Ni3S2/Ni3P heterostructure with high work function can lower the Fermi energy level, and therefore effectively suppressing continuous electrolyte decomposition derived from the electron&#8208;tunneling effect after long&#8208;term sodiation process. Furthermore, the Ni3S2/Ni3P heterostructure on 3D porous nickel foam (Ni3S2/Ni3P@NF) is experimentally fabricated as an advanced Na&#8208;anode current collector. The seamless Ni3S2/Ni3P heterostructure not only offers abundant active sites to induce uniform Na+ deposition and enhance ion&#8208;transport kinetics, but also facilitates the formation of stable SEI for dendrite&#8208;free sodium anode, which are confirmed by cryogenic components transmission electron microscopy tests and in situ spectroscopy characterization. As a result, the Na&#8208;composite anode (Ni3S2/Ni3P@NF@Na) delivers stable plating/stripping process of 5000 h and high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% over 2500 cycles. More impressively, the assembled sodium&#8208;ion full cell displays ultralong cycle life of 10&#160;000 cycles at 20 C. The strategy of stabilizing the sodium&#8208;metal anode gives fundamental insight into the potential construction of advanced RSMBs.

         <title>A Novel &#8220;Inside&#8208;Out&#8221; Intraocular Nanomedicine Delivery Mode for Nanomaterials&#8217; Biological Effect Enhanced Choroidal Neovascularization Occlusion and Microenvironment Regulation</title>

         <dc:description>
A Pt and Au nanoparticle decorated zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 nanoplatform is developed to load indocyanine green for precise choroidal neovascularization occlusion and microenvironment regulation. A novel &#8220;inside&#8208;out&#8221; intraocular nanomedicine delivery mode is exploited to penetrate the internal limiting membrane through M&#252;ller cells endocytosis. The mRNA expressions of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; and VEGF reduce by 90.2% and 81.7%, respectively, compared to verteporfin treatment.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is commonly used in choroidal neovascularization (CNV) treatment due to the superior light transmittance of the eye. However, PDT often leads to surrounding tissue damage and further microenvironmental deterioration, including exacerbated hypoxia, inflammation, and secondary neovascularization. In this work, Pt nanoparticles (NPs) and Au NPs decorated zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 nanoplatform is developed to load indocyanine green for precise PDT and microenvironment amelioration, which can penetrate the internal limiting membrane through M&#252;ller cells endocytosis and target to CNV by surface&#8208;grafted cyclo(Arg&#8211;Gly&#8211;Asp&#8211;d&#8208;Phe&#8211;Lys) after intravitreal injection. The excessive H2O2 in the CNV microenvironment is catalyzed by catalase&#8208;like Pt NPs for hypoxia relief and enhanced PDT occlusion of neovascular. Meanwhile, Au NPs show significant anti&#8208;inflammatory and anti&#8208;angiogenesis properties in regulating macrophages and blocking vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Compared with verteporfin treatment, the mRNA expressions of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; and VEGF in the nanoplatform group are downregulated by 90.2% and 81.7%, respectively. Therefore, the nanoplatform realizes a comprehensive CNV treatment effect based on the high drug loading capacity and biosafety. The CNV treatment mode developed in this work provides a valuable reference for treating other diseases with similar physiological barriers that limit drug delivery and similar microenvironment.

         <title>Y&#8208;Type Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors with Outer Branched Side Chains and Inner Cyclohexane Side Chains for 19.36% Efficiency Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Y&#8208;type non&#8208;fullerene acceptors with outer branched side chains and inner cyclohexane side chains are designed for polymer solar cells with the power conversion efficiencies of 18.52% and 19.36% achieved in the binary and ternary blend devices, respectively, which are among the highest values for single&#8208;junction solar cells at present.








Abstract
Raising the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of Y&#8208;type non&#8208;fullerene acceptors can increase the open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) and thus the photovoltaic performance of the current top performing polymer solar cells (PSCs). One of the viable routes is demonstrated by the successful Y6 derivative of L8&#8208;BO with the branched alkyl chains at the outer side. This will introduce steric hindrance and reduce intermolecular aggregation, thus open up the bandgap and raise the LUMO energy level. To take further advantages of the steric hindrance influence on optoelectronic properties of Y6 derivatives, two Y&#8208;type non&#8208;fullerene acceptors of BTP&#8208;Cy&#8208;4F and BTP&#8208;Cy&#8208;4Cl are designed and synthesized by adopting outer branched side chains and inner cyclohexane side chains. An outstanding Voc of 0.937&#160;V is achieved in the D18:BTP&#8208;Cy&#8208;4F binary blend devices along with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.52%. With the addition of BTP&#8208;eC9 to extend the absorption spectral coverage, a remarkable PCE of 19.36% is realized finally in the related ternary blend devices, which is one of the highest values for single&#8208;junction PSCs at present. The results illustrate the great potential of cyclohexane side chains in constructing high&#8208;performance non&#8208;fullerene acceptors and their PSCs.

         <title>Semi&#8208;Transparent, Chiral Organic Photodiodes with Incident Direction&#8208;Dependent Selectivity for Circularly Polarized Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semi&#8208;transparent organic photodiodes containing chiral non&#8208;fullerene acceptor and achiral polymer donor respond differently to left and right circularly polarized light. The preference switches when changing the direction of the incoming light. Circular selective absorption in combination with selective collection of carriers from a narrow space charge region can account for the change in polarization.








Abstract
Detection of the circular polarization of light is possible using chiral semiconductors, yet the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Semi&#8208;transparent chiral photodiodes allow for a simple experiment to investigate the basis of their selectivity: changing the side from which the diode is illuminated. A reversal of circular selectivity is observed in photocurrent generation when changing the direction of illumination on organic, bulk&#8208;heterojunction cells. The change in selectivity can be explained by a space&#8208;charge limitation on the collection of photocarriers in combination with preferential absorption of one of the circular polarizations of near&#8208;infrared light by the chiral non&#8208;fullerene acceptor. The space&#8208;charge limitation is supported by detailed measurements of frequency and intensity dependence of dc and ac photocurrents.

         <title>Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Mediated Drug Delivery for First Aid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)&#8208;mediated first&#8208;aid system is developed for targeted drug delivery (uFAST), which enables autonomous administration of emergency therapeutics via UAVs to achieve timely first aid. The implementability and safety of the uFAST with a dual&#8208;mode glucagon microneedle patch in emergency care is well demonstrated in a severe hypoglycemic pig disease model.








Abstract
Timely administration of key medications toward patients with sudden diseases is critical to saving lives. However, slow transport of first&#8208;aid therapeutics and the potential absence of trained people for drug usage can&#160;lead&#160;to severe injuries or even death. Herein, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)&#8208;mediated first&#8208;aid system for targeted delivery (uFAST) is developed. It allows unattended administration of emergency therapeutics&#8208;loaded transdermal microneedle (MN) patches toward patients to relieve symptoms by a contact&#8208;triggered microneedle applicator (CTMA). The implementability and safety of the uFAST for first aid is demonstrated in a severe hypoglycemic pig model by automatically delivering a glucagon patch with immediate and bioresponsive dual release modes. This platform technique may facilitate the development of UAV&#8208;mediated first&#8208;aid treatments for other sudden diseases.

         <title>Dislocated Bilayer MOF Enables High&#8208;Selectivity Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to CO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D monolayer and 2D bilayer metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are constructed by a simple solvothermal method. The bilayer MOF is a novel dislocation 2D porphyrin&#8208;based MOF material that exhibits good structural stability as well as ultra&#8208;high CO selectivity for photocatalytic CO2 reduction (100% selectivity). This work offers a new strategy for the construction of bilayer MOFs and provides a new perspective for the customization of photocatalytic performance.








Abstract
The highly selective photoreduction of CO2 into valuable small&#8208;molecule chemical feedstocks such as CO is an effective strategy for addressing the energy crisis and environmental problems. However, it remains a challenge because the complex CO2 photoreduction process usually generates multiple possible products and requires a subsequent separation step. In this paper, 2D monolayer and bilayer porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are successfully constructed by adjusting the reaction temperature and solvent polarity with 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin as the light&#8208;harvesting ligand. The bilayer MOF is a low&#8208;dimensional MOF with a special structure in which the upper and lower layers are arranged in dislocation and are bridged by halogen ions. This bilayer MOF exhibits 100% ultra&#8208;high selectivity for the reduction of CO2 to CO under simulated sunlight without any cocatalyst or photosensitizer and can be recycled at least three times. The intrinsic mechanism of this photocatalytic CO2 reduction process is explored through experimental characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work shows that the rational design of the number of layers in 2D MOF structures can tune the stability of these structures and opens a new avenue for the design of highly selective MOF photocatalysts.

         <title>Multifunctional 3D&#8208;Printed Pollen Grain&#8208;Inspired Hydrogel Microrobots for On&#8208;Demand Anchoring and Cargo Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional hydrogel microrobot is created by different stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels with pollen grain&#8208;inspired microstructures. The robot is capable of conducting temperature&#8208;responsive on&#8208;demand surface attachment, magnetic locomotion, and pH&#8208;responsive cargo delivery toward biomedical applications.








Abstract
While a majority of wireless microrobots have shown multi&#8208;responsiveness to implement complex biomedical functions, their functional executions are strongly dependent on the range of stimulus inputs, which curtails their functional diversity. Furthermore, their responsive functions are coupled to each other, which results in the overlap of the task operations. Here, a 3D&#8208;printed multifunctional microrobot inspired by pollen grains with three hydrogel components is demonstrated: iron platinum (FePt) nanoparticle&#8208;embedded pentaerythritol triacrylate (PETA), poly N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide (pNIPAM), and poly N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide acrylic acid (pNIPAM&#8208;AAc) structures. Each of these structures exhibits their respective targeted functions: responding to magnetic fields for torque&#8208;driven surface rolling and steering, exhibiting temperature responsiveness for on&#8208;demand surface attachment (anchoring), and pH&#8208;responsive cargo release. The versatile multifunctional pollen grain&#8208;inspired robots conceptualized here pave the way for various future medical microrobots to improve their projected performance and functional diversity.

         <title>Conjugated Coordination Polymer as a New Platform for Efficient and Selective Electroreduction of Nitrate into Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy for simultaneous enhancement of activity and selectivity toward nitrate electroreduction into ammonia (NRA) is demonstrated by utilizing Ni&#8208;based conjugated coordination polymer catalysts for the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study. Coordination modulation can tailor their electrostatic attractions with the metal&#8208;hydrated cations that can regulate proton migration at the catalyst surface, promoting the NRA and inhibiting the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).








Abstract
Electroreduction of nitrate into ammonia (NRA) provides a sustainable route to convert the widespread nitrate pollutants into high&#8208;value&#8208;added products under ambient conditions, which unfortunately suffers from unsatisfactory selectivity due to the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Previous strategies of modifying the metal sites of catalysts often met a dilemma for simultaneously promoting activity and selectivity toward NRA. Here, a general strategy is reported to enable an efficient and selective NRA process through coordination modulation of single&#8208;atom catalysts to tailor the local proton concentration at the catalyst surface. By contrast, two analogous Ni&#8208;single&#8208;atom enriched conjugated coordination polymers (NiO4&#8208;CCP and NiN4&#8208;CCP) with different coordination motifs are investigated for the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study. The NiO4&#8208;CCP catalyst exhibits an ammonia yield rate as high as 1.83&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 with a Faradaic efficiency of 94.7% under a current density of 125&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, outperforming the NiN4&#8208;CCP catalyst. These experimental and theoretical studies both suggest that the strategy of coordination modulation can not only accelerate the NRA&#160;by adjusting the adsorption energies of NRA intermediates on the metal sites but also inhibit the HER through regulating the proton migration with contributions from the metal&#8208;hydrated cations adsorbed at the catalyst surface, thus achieving simultaneous enhancement of NRA selectivity and activity.

         <title>Unlocking High Capacity and Fast Na+ Diffusion of HxCrS2 by Proton&#8208;Exchange Pretreatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pretreatment of NaCrS2 to produce HxCrS2 results in a more robust and higher performing electrode by numerous measures. Proton exchange produces a heterostructure that permits fast diffusion while also seemingly unlocking reversible access to cationic redox, enabling high capacity. The unique biphasic structure of HxCrS2 may be generalizable to other materials, opening a new class of electrode materials.








Abstract
This study presents a new material, &#8220;HxCrS2&#8221; (denotes approximate composition) formed by proton&#8208;exchange of NaCrS2 which has a measured capacity of 728 mAh g&#8722;1 with significant improvements to capacity retention, sustaining over 700 mAh g&#8722;1 during cycling experiments. This is the highest reported capacity for a transition metal sulfide electrode and outperforms the most promising proposed sodium anodes to date. HxCrS2 exhibits a biphasic structure featuring alternating crystalline and amorphous lamella on the scale of a few nanometers. This unique structural motif enables reversible access to Cr redox in the material resulting in higher capacities than seen in the parent structure which features only S redox. Pretreatment by proton&#8208;exchange offers a route to materials such as HxCrS2 which provide fast diffusion and high capacities for sodium&#8208;ion&#160;batteries.

&lt;/sub&gt;CrS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; may be generalizable to other materials, opening a new class of electrode materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study presents a new material, &#8220;H&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;CrS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8221; (denotes approximate composition) formed by proton-exchange of NaCrS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which has a measured capacity of 728 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with significant improvements to capacity retention, sustaining over 700 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; during cycling experiments. This is the highest reported capacity for a transition metal sulfide electrode and outperforms the most promising proposed sodium anodes to date. H&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;CrS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits a biphasic structure featuring alternating crystalline and amorphous lamella on the scale of a few nanometers. This unique structural motif enables reversible access to Cr redox in the material resulting in higher capacities than seen in the parent structure which features only S redox. Pretreatment by proton-exchange offers a route to materials such as H&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;CrS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which provide fast diffusion and high capacities for sodium-ion&#160;batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrasensitive and Ultraprecise Pressure Sensors for Soft Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Making flexible sensors more precise is the focus of this research. It is found that by making the pressure sensing layer using pure materials&#160;and separating it from the rest of the sensor structure, the errors caused by the sensor's deformation can be reduced when it is subjected to external forces. This leads to improved precision and flexibility in sensing.








Abstract
Highly sensitive soft pressure sensors have attracted tremendous attention in recent years due to their great promise in robotics, healthcare, smart wearables, etc. Although high sensitivities can be realized by existing sensing mechanisms, they usually cause large random errors owing to inhomogeneous sensing layers, thus considerably reducing the sensing precision for practical applications. Herein, a pure&#8208;polymer and field emission bilayer structure (PFEBS)&#8208;based transduction mechanism is presented to successfully design an ultrasensitive and ultraprecise soft pressure sensor for the first time. This unique structure enables numerous tunneling electrons generated by field emission to be transmitted through the homogeneous sensing layer, which undergoes uniform deformation under subtle pressures, simultaneously achieving a sensing precision with variation &lt;1.62% and a sensitivity of 372.2 kPa&#8722;1. This study offers a new design strategy to develop next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance flexible pressure sensors for soft systems.

         <title>Highly Damping and Self&#8208;Healable Ionic Elastomer from Dynamic Phase Separation of Sticky Fluorinated Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the heterogeneous structure of adipose tissue, the first example of damping self&#8208;healable ionic elastomer is reported, which features a dynamic phase&#8208;separated structure with energy&#8208;dissipating nanophases embedded in an elastic matrix. By virtue of phase separation and sticky liquid crystal assembly of fluorinated copolymers, this design reconciles elasticity and damping capacity, which are usually contradictive in previous ionic skins.








Abstract
Shock&#8208;induced low&#8208;frequency vibration damage is extremely harmful to bionic soft robots and machines that may incur the malfunction of fragile electronic elements. However, current skin&#8208;like self&#8208;healable ionic elastomers as the artificial sensing and protecting layer still lack the ability to dampen vibrations, due to their almost opposite design for molecular frictions to material's elasticity. Inspired by the two&#8208;phase structure of adipose tissue (the natural damping skin layer), here, a highly damping ionic elastomer with energy&#8208;dissipating nanophases embedded in an elastic matrix is introduced, which is formed by polymerization&#8208;induced dynamic phase separation of sticky fluorinated copolymers in the presence of lithium salts. Such a supramolecular design decouples the elastic and damping functions into two distinct phases, and thus reconciles a few intriguing properties including ionic conductivity, high stretchability, softness, strain&#8208;stiffening, elastic recovery, room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healability, recyclability, and most importantly, record&#8208;high damping capacity at the human motion frequency range (loss factor tan &#948;&#160;&gt;&#160;1 at 0.1&#8211;50&#160;Hz). This study opens the door for the artificial syntheses of high&#8208;performance damping ionic skins with robust sensing and protective applications in soft electronics and robotics.

         <title>Picoperovskites: The Smallest Conceivable Isolated Halide Perovskite Structures Formed within Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide perovskites CsPbBr3 and lead&#8208;free CsSnI3 form &#8220;picoperovskites&#8221; in 1.2&#8211;1.6&#160;nm&#8208;diameter single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes with cross&#8208;sectional unit&#8208;cell or sub&#8208;unit&#8208;cell dimensions. The smallest of these are bilayer inorganic polymers retaining ABX3 stoichiometry while intermediate&#8208;scale Cs3PbBr3 preserves Pb2+ by forming ordered vacancies. The largest Cs4Sn4Ix form alternates Cs4 and Sn4Ix layers along the nanotube cavities.








Abstract
Halide perovskite structures are revolutionizing the design of optoelectronic materials, including solar cells, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and photovoltaics when formed at the quantum scale. Four isolated sub&#8208;nanometer, or picoscale, halide perovskite structures formed inside &#8776;1.2&#8211;1.6&#160;nm single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) by melt insertion from CsPbBr3 and lead&#8208;free CsSnI3 are reported. Three directly relate to the ABX3 perovskite archetype while a fourth is a perovskite&#8208;like lamellar structure with alternating Cs4 and polyhedral Sn4Ix layers. In &#8776;1.4&#160;nm&#8208;diameter SWCNTs, CsPbBr3 forms Cs3PbIIBr5 nanowires, one ABX3 unit cell in cross section with the Pb2+ oxidation state maintained by ordered Cs+ vacancies. Within &#8776;1.2&#160;nm&#8208;diameter SWCNTs, CsPbBr3 and CsSnI3 form inorganic&#8208;polymer&#8208;like bilayer structures, one&#8208;fourth of an ABX3 unit cell in cross section with systematically reproduced ABX3 stoichiometry. Producing these smallest halide perovskite structures at their absolute synthetic cross&#8208;sectional limit enables quantum confinement effects with first&#8208;principles calculations demonstrating bandgap widening compared to corresponding bulk structural forms.

         <title>Rational Design of Platinum&#8211;Bismuth Sulfide Schottky Heterostructure for Sonocatalysis&#8208;Mediated Hydrogen Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of sonocatalytic hydrogen evolution is first proposed. The synthesized platinum&#8211;bismuth sulfide&#160;nanoparticles exhibit ultrasound&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen production, glutathione oxidation, relieve hypoxia in vitro and in vivo, and effectively kill cancer cells by inhibiting cancer cell energy metabolism, increasing intratumoral reactive oxygen species levels, and inducing DNA damage.








Abstract
Conventional sonodynamic therapy is unavoidably limited by the tumor microenvironment, although many sonosensitizers have been developed to improve them to a certain extent. Given this, a concept of sonocatalytic hydrogen evolution is proposed, which is defined as an oxygen&#8208;independent therapeutics. To demonstrate the feasibility of the concept, the narrow&#8208;bandgap semiconductor bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3) is selected as the sonocatalyst and platinum (Pt) nanoparticles are grown in situ to optimize their catalytic performance. In this nanocatalytic system, the Pt nanoparticles help to capture sonoexcited electrons, whereas intratumoral overexpressed glutathione (GSH), as a natural hole sacrificial agent, can consume sonoexcited holes, which greatly improves the charge&#8208;separation efficiency and promotes controllable and sustainable H2&#160;generation. Even under hypoxic conditions, the Pt&#8208;Bi2S3&#160;nanoparticles can also produce sufficient H2&#160;under ultrasound irradiation. Mechanistically, mitochondrial dysfunction caused by H2&#160;and intratumoral redox homeostasis destruction by GSH depletion synergistically damage DNA to induce tumor cells apoptosis. At the same time, the Pt nanoparticles and holes can also trigger the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into O2&#160;to relieve tumor hypoxia,&#160;thus&#160;being synergistic with GSH depletion to reverse tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. The proposed sonocatalysis&#8208;mediated therapy will provide a new direction to realize facile and efficient cancer therapy.

At the same time, the Pt nanoparticles and holes can also trigger the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;to relieve tumor hypoxia,&#160;thus&#160;being synergistic with GSH depletion to reverse tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. The proposed sonocatalysis-mediated therapy will provide a new direction to realize facile and efficient cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual/Triple Template&#8208;Induced Evolved Emulsion for Controllable Construction of Anisotropic Carbon Nanoparticles from Concave to Convex</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual/triple template&#8208;induced evolved emulsion strategy is developed for the precise construction of anisotropic mesoporous carbon nanoparticles. It not only endows the concave structure with adjustable size and meso&#8208;structure but also realizes the innovative transformation from concave to convex in a one&#8208;pot method. Moreover, the well&#8208;designed basin&#8208;concave and mountain&#8208;convex nanoparticles manifest excellent performance for improving drug release rate and enzyme catalytic efficiency.








Abstract
Anisotropic mesoporous carbon (AMC) nanoparticles with asymmetric external morphologies, topological internal structure, and superior performance of carbon species are attracting great attention because of their seductive features differentiating them from symmetric nanoparticles. However, a bewildering challenge but crucial desire remains to endow them with flexibly tunable morphology and pore structure. Herein, a dual/triple&#8208;templating evolved emulsion strategy for tunable fabrication of AMC nanoparticles with distinctive defined structure by interface&#8208;energy&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly is first reported based on a brand&#8208;new mechanism. It describes the possible formation process of the concave&#8208;cavity structure and allows for manipulation of the longitudinal and lateral sizes systematically by adjusting emulsion polarity and sodium oleate dosage, respectively. Interestingly, the internal pore structure can be rearranged into radial channels and the external morphology can realize structural transformation from concave to convex by innovatively introducing the third template n&#8208;hexanol, which is unprecedented at nanoscale. Remarkably, due to the excellent properties of carbon species and unique structural characteristics, AMC nanoparticles not only demonstrate good biocompatibility but also exhibit splendid performance in improving the dissolution and release rates of insoluble drug and enhancing the enzyme catalytic efficiency. Generally, this approach provides new inspiration and insights for expanding exquisite anisotropic nanomaterials for many potential applications.

         <title>A Breathable, Passive&#8208;Cooling, Non&#8208;Inflammatory, and Biodegradable Aerogel Electronic Skin for Wearable Physical&#8208;Electrophysiological&#8208;Chemical Analysis</title>

A breathable, passive&#8208;cooling, non&#8208;inflammatory, biodegradable, and flexible aerogel electronic skin is developed to monitor physical, electrophysiological, and metabolic biomarkers from the human body continuously and simultaneously.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time monitoring of human health can be significantly improved by designing novel electronic skin (E&#8208;skin) platforms that mimic the characteristics and sensitivity of human skin. A high&#8208;quality E&#8208;skin platform that can simultaneously monitor multiple physiological and metabolic biomarkers without introducing skin discomfort or irritation is an unmet medical need. Conventional E&#8208;skins are either monofunctional or made from elastomeric films that do not include key synergistic features of natural skin, such as multi&#8208;sensing, breathability, and thermal management capabilities in a single patch. Herein, a biocompatible and biodegradable E&#8208;skin patch based on flexible gelatin methacryloyl aerogel (FGA) for non&#8208;invasive and continuous monitoring of multiple biomarkers of interest is engineered and demonstrated. Taking advantage of cryogenic temperature treatment and slow polymerization, FGA is fabricated with a highly interconnected porous structure that displays good flexibility, passive&#8208;cooling capabilities, and ultra&#8208;lightweight properties that make it comfortable to wear for long periods of time. It also provides numerous permeable capillary channels for thermal&#8208;moisture transfer, ensuring its excellent breathability. Therefore, the engineered FGA&#8208;based E&#8208;skin can simultaneously monitor body temperature, hydration, and biopotentials via electrophysiological sensors and detect glucose, lactate, and alcohol levels via electrochemical sensors. This work offers a previously unexplored materials strategy for next&#8208;generation E&#8208;skin platforms with superior practicality.

         <title>A Pseudocapacitor Diode Based on Ion&#8208;Selective Surface Redox Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pseudocapacitor diode is proposed for the first time, which is constructed by the ion&#8208;selective surface redox mechanism of spinel ZnCo2O4 in aqueous electrolyte KOH, thus successfully integrating the function of blocking the unidirectional current response of a diode into an aqueous pseudocapacitor with fast ion conduction capability.








Abstract
Supercapacitor diode (CAPode) is a novel device that integrates ion diode functionality into a conventional electrical double&#8208;layer capacitor and is expected to have great applications in emerging fields such as signal propagation, microcircuit rectification, logic operations, and neuromorphology. Here, a brand new pseudocapacitor diode is reported that has both high charge storage (50.2&#160;C&#160;g&#8722;1 at 20&#160;mV&#160;s&#8722;1) and high rectification (the rectification ratio of 0.79 at 200&#160;mV&#160;s&#8722;1) properties, which is realized by the ion&#8208;selective surface redox reaction of spinel ZnCo2O4 in aqueous alkaline electrolyte. Furthermore, an application of the integrated device is demonstrated in the logic gate of circuit system to realize the logic operations of &#8220;AND&#8221; and &#8220;OR&#8221;. This work not only expands the types of CAPodes, but also provides a train of thought for constructing high&#8208;performance capacitive ionic diodes.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Locked Tandem Fluorescent Probe for Imaging of Pyroptosis in Cancer Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;locked and tandem activatable probe (DTAP) is presented for real&#8208;time near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging of intratumoral pyroptosis during cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy in living mice. It provides a non&#8208;invasive tool to study the regulatory mechanism of pyroptosis during cancer therapy and predict cancer therapeutic efficacy, hence capable of being applied to optimize cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapies for precision medicine.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time imaging of programmed cancer cell death (PCD) is imperative to monitor cancer therapeutic efficacy and tailor therapeutic regimens; however, specific in vivo detection of intratumoral pyroptosis remains challenging. Herein, a dual&#8208;locked and tandem activatable probe (DTAP) is reported for near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging of intratumoral pyroptosis during cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy in living mice. The probe comprises a hemicyanine dye dual&#8208;locked with an enzyme&#8208;responsive moiety that can be tandemly cleaved by pyroptosis&#8208;related biomarker (Caspase&#8208;1) and cancer biomarker (GGT) to turn on its NIRF signal. As pyroptosis plays a vital role in triggering anti&#8208;tumor immune responses, the activated signal of DTAP correlates well with the population of tumor&#8208;infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocytes and tumor growth inhibition, consequently permitting the prediction of cancer therapeutic efficacy. This study also provides a non&#8208;invasive technique to study the regulatory mechanism of pyroptosis in cancer therapy and to optimize cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapies for precision medicine.

A graph analysis based on the desired sneak current is performed using a self&#8208;rectifying memristor and a &#8220;metal cell at diagonalcrossbar array (mCBA)&#8221; structure. mCBA effectively extracts hidden information from complex networks without preprocessing and loss of information. Three graph algorithms (pathfinding, link prediction, community detection) and brain network&#8208;based attention&#8208;deficit/hyperactivity disorder classification are performed effectively based on the mCBA.








Abstract
Many big data have interconnected and dynamic graph structures growing over time. Analyzing these graphical data requires the hidden relationship between the nodes in the graphs to be identified, which has conventionally been achieved by finding the effective similarity. However, graphs are generally non&#8208;Euclidean, which does not allow finding it. In this study, the non&#8208;Euclidean graphs are mapped to a specific crossbar array (CBA) composed of self&#8208;rectifying memristors and metal cells at the diagonal positions. The sneak current, an intrinsic physical property in the CBA, allows for the identification of the similarity function. The sneak&#8208;current&#8208;based similarity function indicates the distance between the nodes, which can be used to predict the probability that unconnected nodes will be connected in the future, connectivity between communities, and neural connections in a brain. When all bit lines of the CBA are connected to the ground, the sneak current is suppressed, and the CBA can be used to search for adjacent nodes. This work demonstrates the physical calculation methods applied to various graphical problems&#160;using the CBA composed of the self&#8208;rectifying memristor based on the HfO2 switching layer. Moreover, such applications suffer less from the memristors&#8217; inherent issues related to their stochastic nature.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Guaranteed High Carrier Mobility in Quasi&#8208;2D Thermoelectric Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>

The horizontal mirror symmetry in BaAgSb vanishes the electron&#8211;phonon coupling mediated by phonons with purely out&#8208;of&#8208;plane vibrational vectors, which weakens the phonon&#8208;induced carrier scattering and triggers a record hole mobility among polycrystalline quasi&#8208;2D thermoelectrics. Such high mobility accompanied with intrinsically low thermal conductivity gives rise to excellent p&#8208;type thermoelectric performance in polycrystalline BaAgSb.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D semiconductors have garnered immense research interest for next&#8208;generation electronics and thermoelectrics due to their unique structural, mechanical, and transport properties. However, most quasi&#8208;2D semiconductors experimentally synthesized so far have relatively low carrier mobility, preventing the achievement of exceptional power output. To break through this obstacle, a route is proposed based on the crystal symmetry arguments to facilitate the charge transport of quasi&#8208;2D semiconductors, in which the horizontal mirror symmetry is found to vanish the electron&#8211;phonon coupling strength mediated by phonons with purely out&#8208;of&#8208;plane vibrational vectors. This is demonstrated in ZrBeSi&#8208;type quasi&#8208;2D systems, where the representative sample Ba1.01AgSb shows a high room&#8208;temperature hole mobility of 344 cm2 V&#8722;1 S&#8722;1, a record value among quasi&#8208;2D polycrystalline thermoelectrics. Accompanied by intrinsically low thermal conductivity, an excellent p&#8208;type zT of &#8776;1.3 is reached at 1012 K, which is the highest value in ZrBeSi&#8208;type compounds. This work uncovers the relation between electron&#8211;phonon coupling and crystal symmetry in quasi&#8208;2D systems, which broadens the horizon to develop high mobility semiconductors for electronic and energy conversion applications.

         <title>Highly Sensitive Tin&#8208;Lead Perovskite Photodetectors with Over 450 Days Stability Enabled by Synergistic Engineering for Pulse Oximetry System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>

The multifunctional additive 4&#8208;amino&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzoic acid (ATFBA), with terminal amino and carboxyl groups, passivates the surface defects and enhances the stability of the Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite, therefore resulting in high sensitivity and highly stable Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite photodetectors. In addition, the ATFBA&#8208;based photodetector has been integrated with a pulse oximetry visualization system, successfully yielding accurate blood oxygen saturation and heart rate.








Abstract
Low&#8208;bandgap tin (Sn)&#8208;lead (Pb) halide perovskites can achieve near&#8208;infrared response for photodetectors. However, the Sn&#8208;based devices suffer from notorious instability and high defect densities due to the oxidation propensity of Sn2+. Herein, a multifunctional additive 4&#8208;amino&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzoic acid (ATFBA) is presented, which can passivate surface defects and inhibit the oxidation of Sn2+ through hydrogen bonds and chelation coordination from the terminal amino and carboxyl groups. The perfluorinated benzene ring structure of ATFBA affords the passivator assembled at the grain boundaries to enhance the water resistance. With the synergistical passivation of these functional groups, the Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite photodetector exhibits a remarkable responsivity of 0.52&#160;A&#160;W&#8208;1 and an excellent specific detectivity of 5.34&#160;&#215;&#160;1012 Jones at 850&#160;nm, along with remaining 97% of its initial responsivity over 450 days. Benefitting from high sensitivity, the photodetector is integrated into a pulse oximetry sensor visualization system, yielding accurate blood oxygen saturation and heart rate with less than 2% error. This work paves the avenue toward constructing high&#8208;performance and stable Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite photodetectors for practical applications.

         <title>Electrochemical Replication and Transfer for Low&#8208;Cost, Sub&#8208;100&#160;nm Patterning of Materials on Flexible Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new additive patterning technique, named electrochemical replication and transfer, is developed to pattern a wide variety of metals, semiconductors, and polymers with resolutions spanning from sub&#8208;100&#160;nm to many centimeters on flexible substrates at low cost and high throughput.








Abstract
The fabrication of high&#8208;resolution patterns on flexible substrates is an essential step in the development of flexible electronics. However, the patterning process on flexible substrates often requires expensive equipment and tedious lithographic processing. Here, a bottom&#8208;up patterning technique, termed electrochemical replication and transfer (ERT) is reported, which fabricates multiscale patterns of a wide variety of materials by selective electrodeposition of target materials on a predefined template, and subsequent transfer of the electrodeposited materials to a flexible substrate, while leaving the undamaged template for reuse for over 100 times. The additive and parallel patterning attribute of ERT allows the fabrication of multiscale patterns with resolutions spanning from sub&#8208;100&#160;nm to many centimeters simultaneously, which overcomes the trade&#8208;off between resolution and throughput of conventional patterning techniques. ERT is suitable for fabricating a wide variety of materials including metals, semiconductors, metal oxides, and polymers into arbitrary shapes on flexible substrates at a very low cost.

         <title>Stem Cell Membrane&#8208;Coated Microribbon Scaffolds Induce Regenerative Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses in a Critical&#8208;Size Cranial Bone Defect Model</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell membrane coating represents a biomimetic strategy for modifying the surface of biomaterials. Coating macroporous microribbon scaffolds with mesenchymal stem cell membrane (MSCM) enhances cranial bone healing via immunomodulation. Primed MSCM&#8208;coating contains ligands that promote M&#966; polarization toward M2, induce Treg differentiation and TCD8+ apoptosis, and enhance MSC osteogenesis. MSCM coating synergizes with BMP&#8208;2 to further accelerate bone regeneration while suppressing inflammation.








Abstract
Naturally&#8208;derived cell membranes have shown great promise in functionalizing nanoparticles to enhance biointerfacing functions for drug delivery applications. However, its potential for functionalizing macroporous scaffolds to enhance tissue regeneration in vivo remains unexplored. Engineering scaffolds with immunomodulatory functions represents an exciting strategy for tissue regeneration but is largely limited to soft tissues. Critical&#8208;sized bone defects cannot heal on their own, and the role of adaptive immune cells in scaffold&#8208;mediated healing of cranial bone defects remains largely unknown. Here, mensenchymal stem cell membrane (MSCM)&#8208;coated microribbon (&#181;RB) scaffolds for treating critical size cranial bone defects via targeting immunomodulation are reported. Confocal imaging and proteomic analyses are used to confirm successful coating and characterize the compositions of cell membrane coating. It is demonstrated that MSCM coating promotes macrophage (M&#966;) polarization toward regenerative phenotype, induces CD8+ T cell apoptosis, and enhances regulatory T cell differentiation in vitro and in vivo. When combined with a low dosage of BMP&#8208;2, MSCM coating further accelerates bone regeneration and suppresses inflammation. These results establish cell membrane&#8208;coated microribbon scaffolds as a promising strategy for treating critical size bone defects via immunomodulation. The platform may be broadly used with different cell membranes and scaffolds to enhance regeneration of multiple tissue types.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally-derived cell membranes have shown great promise in functionalizing nanoparticles to enhance biointerfacing functions for drug delivery applications. However, its potential for functionalizing macroporous scaffolds to enhance tissue regeneration in vivo remains unexplored. Engineering scaffolds with immunomodulatory functions represents an exciting strategy for tissue regeneration but is largely limited to soft tissues. Critical-sized bone defects cannot heal on their own, and the role of adaptive immune cells in scaffold-mediated healing of cranial bone defects remains largely unknown. Here, mensenchymal stem cell membrane (MSCM)-coated microribbon (&lt;i&gt;&#181;&lt;/i&gt;RB) scaffolds for treating critical size cranial bone defects via targeting immunomodulation are reported. Confocal imaging and proteomic analyses are used to confirm successful coating and characterize the compositions of cell membrane coating. It is demonstrated that MSCM coating promotes macrophage (M&#966;) polarization toward regenerative phenotype, induces CD8+ T cell apoptosis, and enhances regulatory T cell differentiation in vitro and in vivo. When combined with a low dosage of BMP-2, MSCM coating further accelerates bone regeneration and suppresses inflammation. These results establish cell membrane-coated microribbon scaffolds as a promising strategy for treating critical size bone defects via immunomodulation. The platform may be broadly used with different cell membranes and scaffolds to enhance regeneration of multiple tissue types.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multiplexed Ultrasensitive Sample&#8208;to&#8208;Answer RT&#8208;LAMP Chip for the Identification of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and Influenza Viruses</title>

         <dc:description>
An ultrasensitive sample&#8208;to&#8208;answer chip operated by LED is developed to detect SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and influenza viruses simultaneously. The ultrafast target enrichment (&#8776;500&#215;) followed by autonomous elution and amplification via photothermal activation enables limit&#8208;of&#8208;detection of 0.5 copies &#181;L&#8722;1. The sensitive detection in point&#8208;of&#8208;care settings comparable to standard polymerase chain reaction allows timely management of various pandemic situations that may be faced shortly.








Abstract
Prompt on&#8208;site diagnosis of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 with other respiratory infections will have minimized the global impact of the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic through rapid, effective management. However, no such multiplex point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) chip has satisfied a suitable sensitivity of gold&#8208;standard nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). Here, a rapid multiplexed ultrasensitive sample&#8208;to&#8208;answer loop&#8208;mediated isothermal amplification (MUSAL) chip operated by simple LED&#8208;driven photothermal amplification to detect six targets from single&#8208;swab sampling is presented. First, the MUSAL chip allows ultrafast on&#8208;chip sample preparation with &#8776;500&#8208;fold preconcentration at a rate of 1.2&#160;mL min&#8722;1. Second, the chip enables contamination&#8208;free amplification using autonomous target elution into on&#8208;chip reagents by photothermal activation. Finally, the chip accomplishes multiplexed on&#8208;chip diagnostics of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and influenza viruses with a limit of detection (LoD) of 0.5 copies &#181;L&#8722;1. The rapid, ultrasensitive, cost&#8208;effective sample&#8208;to&#8208;answer chip with a multiplex capability will allow timely management of various pandemics situations that may be faced shortly.

         <title>A Super Tough, Rapidly Biodegradable, Ultrafast Hemostatic Bioglue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new bioglue is composed of amidated&#8208;gelatin and Tetra&#8208;PEG&#8208;SS for rapid hemostasis in massive hemorrhage. The amino terminals in gelatin quickly react with active ester moieties in the PEG&#8208;SS, endowing the amino&#8208;gelatin&#8208;PEG glue firm and indiscriminate adhesion with various moist tissues (e.g., adhesively sealing cardiac hemorrhagic wounds). The bioglue provides a fascinating hemostatic approach for clinical hemostasis and emergency rescue.








Abstract
Death happening due to massive hemorrhage has been involved in military conflicts, traffic accidents, and surgical injuries of various human disasters. Achieving rapid and effective hemostasis to save lives is crucial in urgent massive bleeding situations. Herein, a covalent cross&#8208;linked AG&#8208;PEG glue based on extracellular matrix&#8208;like amino&#8208;gelatin (AG) and PEG derivatives is developed. The AG&#8208;PEG glue gelatinizes fast and exhibits firm and indiscriminate close adhesion with various moist tissues upon being dosed. The formed glue establishes an adhesive and robust barrier to seal the arterial, hepatic, and cardiac hemorrhagic wounds, enabling it to withstand up to 380&#160;mmHg blood pressure in comparison with normal systolic blood pressure of 60&#8211;180&#160;mmHg. Remarkably, massive bleeding from a pig cardiac penetrating hole with 6&#160;mm diameter is effectively stopped using the glue within 60&#160;s. Postoperative indexes of the treated pig gradually recover and the cardiac wounds regrow significantly at 14&#160;days. Possessing on&#8208;demand solubility, self&#8208;gelling, and rapid degradability, the AG&#8208;PEG glue may provide a fascinating stop&#8208;bleeding approach for clinical hemostasis and emergency rescue.

         <title>Terahertz Nonlinear Hall Rectifiers Based on Spin&#8208;Polarized Topological Electronic States in&#160;1T&#8208;CoTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A second&#8208;order nonlinear Hall effect response for high&#8208;efficiency terahertz rectification, is observed in the spin&#8208;polarized 1T&#8208;CoTe2, led by the zero&#8208;magnetic&#8208;field&#160;extrinsic contribution of topological electronic states. The Hall&#8208;rectifier, without invoking any semiconductor junctions or bias voltage, shows up room&#8208;temperature responsivity of over 0.1 A W&#8722;1, and a mean noise equivalent power of 1 pW Hz&#8722;1/2, opening up device implementation based on quantum&#8208;wavefunction engineering.








Abstract
The zero&#8208;magnetic&#8208;field nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) refers to the second&#8208;order transverse current induced by an applied alternating electric field; it indicates the topological properties of inversion&#8208;symmetry&#8208;breaking crystals. Despite several studies on the NLHE induced by the Berry&#8208;curvature dipole in Weyl semimetals, the direct current conversion by rectification is limited to very low driving frequencies and cryogenic temperatures. The nonlinear photoresponse generated by the NLHE at room temperature can be useful for numerous applications in communication, sensing, and photodetection across a high bandwidth. In this study, observations of the second&#8208;order NLHE in type&#8208;II Dirac semimetal CoTe2 under time&#8208;reversal symmetry are reported. This is determined by the disorder&#8208;induced extrinsic contribution on the broken&#8208;inversion&#8208;symmetry surface and room&#8208;temperature terahertz rectification without the need for semiconductor junctions or bias voltage. It is shown that remarkable photoresponsivity over 0.1 A W&#8722;1, a response time of approximately 710&#160;ns, and a mean noise equivalent power of 1 pW Hz&#8722;1/2 can be achieved at room temperature. The results open a new pathway for low&#8208;energy photon harvesting via nonlinear rectification induced by the NLHE in strongly spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;coupled and inversion&#8208;symmetry&#8208;breaking systems, promising a considerable impact in the field of infrared/terahertz photonics.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Ionizable Iron Nanoadjuvant Augments STING Activation for Personalized Vaccination Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acid&#8208;ionizable iron nanoadjuvant (PEIM) is developed to potentiate cancer vaccination immunotherapy. PEIM nanoadjuvant is coassembled from acid&#8208;ionizable&#160;copolymers with iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) and a stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist. PEIM nanoadjuvant effectively delivers tumor antigens to lymph nodes, amplifies STING activation and type&#8208;I interferon (IFN&#8208;I) production, and ultimately&#160;elicits antigen&#8208;specific T&#8208;cell response to inhibit tumor growth.








Abstract
The critical challenge for cancer vaccine&#8208;induced T&#8208;cell immunity is the sustained activation of antigen cross&#8208;presentation in antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs) with innate immune stimulation. In this study, it is first discovered that the clinically used magnetic contrast agents, iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs), markedly augment the type&#8208;I interferon (IFN&#8208;I) production profile of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist MSA&#8208;2 and achieve a 16&#8208;fold dosage&#8208;sparing effect in the human STING haplotype. Acid&#8208;ionizable copolymers are coassembled with IONPs and MSA&#8208;2 into iron nanoadjuvants to concentrate STING activation in the draining lymph nodes. The top candidate iron nanoadjuvant (PEIM) efficiently delivers the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) to CD169+ APCs and facilitates antigen cross&#8208;presentation to elicit a 55&#8208;fold greater frequency of antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ cytotoxic T&#8208;lymphocyte response than soluble antigen. PEIM@OVA nanovaccine immunization induces potent and durable antitumor immunity to prevent tumor lung metastasis and eliminate established tumors. Moreover, PEIM nanoadjuvant is applicable to deliver autologous tumor antigen and synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade therapy for prevention of postoperative tumor recurrence and distant metastasis in B16&#8208;OVA melanoma and MC38 colorectal tumor models. The acid&#8208;ionizable iron nanoadjuvant offers a generalizable and readily translatable strategy to augment STING cascade activation and antigen cross&#8208;presentation for personalized cancer vaccination immunotherapy.

In this study, it is first discovered that the clinically used magnetic contrast agents, iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs), markedly augment the type-I interferon (IFN-I) production profile of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist MSA-2 and achieve a 16-fold dosage-sparing effect in the human STING haplotype. Acid-ionizable copolymers are coassembled with IONPs and MSA-2 into iron nanoadjuvants to concentrate STING activation in the draining lymph nodes. The top candidate iron nanoadjuvant (PEIM) efficiently delivers the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) to CD169+ APCs and facilitates antigen cross-presentation to elicit a 55-fold greater frequency of antigen-specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response than soluble antigen. PEIM@OVA nanovaccine immunization induces potent and durable antitumor immunity to prevent tumor lung metastasis and eliminate established tumors. Moreover, PEIM nanoadjuvant is applicable to deliver autologous tumor antigen and synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade therapy for prevention of postoperative tumor recurrence and distant metastasis in B16-OVA melanoma and MC38 colorectal tumor models. The acid-ionizable iron nanoadjuvant offers a generalizable and readily translatable strategy to augment STING cascade activation and antigen cross-presentation for personalized cancer vaccination immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hierarchical Porous Monoliths of Steel with Self&#8208;Reinforcing Adaptive Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous steel structures combining ultralow weight and high mechanical efficiency are manufactured by printing, reducing, and sintering wet foams containing iron oxide precursor particles. By forming new load&#8208;bearing struts when compressed, the porous structures are able to reversibly stiffen in response to nonuniform stresses, a behavior that conceptually resembles the unique adaptive properties of human bone.








Abstract
Porous structures offer an attractive approach to reduce the amount of natural resources used while maintaining relatively high mechanical efficiency. However, for some applications the drop in mechanical properties resulting from the introduction of porosity is too high, which has limited the broader utilization of porous materials in industry. Here, it is shown that steel monoliths can be designed to display high mechanical efficiency and reversible self&#8208;reinforcing properties when made with porous architectures with up to three hierarchical levels. Ultralight steel structures that can float on water and autonomously adapt their stiffness are manufactured by the thermal reduction and sintering of 3D printed foam templates. Using distinct mechanical testing techniques, image analysis, and finite element simulations, the mechanisms leading to the high mechanical efficiency and self&#8208;stiffening ability of the hierarchical porous monoliths are studied. The design and fabrication of mechanically stable porous monoliths using iron as a widely available natural resource is expected to contribute to the future development of functional materials with a more sustainable footprint.

         <title>A Flexible, High&#8208;Voltage (&gt;100&#160;V) Generating Device Based on Zebra&#8208;Like Asymmetrical Photovoltaic Cascade</title>

         <dc:description>
Gold/aluminum micro&#8208;strips repeat along a specific direction and periodically form overlaps and gaps in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail manner like the patterns of a zebra. After compounding with semiconducting supramolecular nanowires, an output voltage of 140&#160;V can be achieved on a flexible substrate upon illumination.








Abstract
The mutual conversion between light and electricity lies at the heart of optoelectronic and photonic applications. Maximization of the photoelectric conversion is a long&#8208;term goal that can be pursued via the fabrication of devices with ad&#8208;hoc architectures. In this framework, it is of utter importance to harvest and transform light irradiation into high electric potential in&#160;specific area for driving functional dielectrics that respond to pure electric field. Here, a nano&#8208;fabrication technology has been devised featuring double self&#8208;alignment that is applied to construct zebra&#8208;like asymmetric heterojunction arrays. Such nanostructured composite, which covers a surface area of 5&#160;&#215;&#160;4&#160;mm2 and contains 500 periodic repeating units, is capable of photo generating voltages as high as 140&#160;V on a flexible substrate. This approach represents a leap over the traditional functionalization process based on simply embedding materials into devices by demonstrating the disruptive potential of integrating oriented nanoscale device components into meta&#8208;material.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Promoted Co&#8208;Production of Dihydroisoquinoline and H2O2 over Defective Zn3In2S6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;functional and defective Zn3In2S6 photocatalyst is developed for the simultaneous efficient photocatalytic co&#8208;syntheses of dihydroisoquinoline and H2O2, which shows the highest rate for both reactions up to date.








Abstract
One of the most sustainable and promising approaches for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production in a low&#8208;cost and environment&#8208;friendly way is photosynthesis, which, however, suffers from poor carrier utilization and low H2O2 productivity. The addition of proton donors such as isopropanol or ethanol can increase H2O2 production, which, unfortunately, will inevitably elevate the entire cost while wasting the oxidizing power of holes (h+). Herein, the tetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQs) is employed as a distinctive proton donor for the thermodynamically feasible and selective semi&#8208;dehydrogenation reaction to highly valuable dihydroisoquinolines (DHIQs), and meanwhile, to couple with and promote H2O2 generation in one photoredox reaction under the photocatalysis by dual&#8208;functional Zn3In2S6 photocatalyst. Surprisingly, the suitably defective Zn3In2S6 offers an excellent and near&#8208;stoichiometric co&#8208;production performance of H2O2 and DHIQs at unprecedentedly high rates of 66.4 and 62.1&#160;mmol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1 under visible light (&#955;&#160;&#8805; 400&#160;nm), respectively, which outperforms all the previously available reports even though sacrificial agents&#160;were&#160;employed in those reports. Additionally, photocatalytic redox reaction mechanism demonstrates that H2O2 can be generated through multiple pathways, highlighting the synergistic effect among ROS (&#183;O2&#8208; and 1O2), h+ and proton donor, which has been ignored in previous studies.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Wavelength Light&#8208;Responsive Metal&#8211;Phenolic Network&#8208;Based Microrobots for Reactive Species Scavenging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a hollow metal&#8211;phenolic network&#8208;based microrobot with spray&#8208;coated asymmetric capping is reported capable of moving under both near&#8208;infrared irradiation and ultraviolet irradiation without fuel. With multi&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;responsiveness, tunable size of the particles, and great reactive oxygen and nitrogen species scavenging capacity, the proposed microrobots can be ideal for future in vivo analytical sensing and medical treatment.








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven microrobots with different propulsion mechanisms have attracted great attention in microrobot synthesis and applications. However, current systems rely heavily on precious metals, using a complex synthesis process and limited working wavelength. It is therefore of great interest to fabricate microrobots that can be driven by multi&#8208;wavelength irradiation and with simple components. Here, metal&#8211;phenolic network (MPN)&#8208;based microrobots are synthesized using a sacrificial polystyrene bead template and an extra capping is added to regulate their symmetry. The hollow MPN microrobots with different layers of capping are capable of moving under both near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, without fuel. The velocity of the microrobots under irradiation is altered by the thickness of the asymmetric capping and their motion could be manipulated remotely by switching the NIR or UV irradiation on and off. With light&#8208;driven mobility, the reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) scavenging activity of the microrobots is significantly increased. Therefore, this proposed microrobot system provides a synthesis strategy to develop asymmetric light&#8208;navigated microrobots for future medical treatment with tunable structure, multi&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;responsive mobility, and great RONS scavenging capacity.

Integrating a coordination polymer catalyst consisting of Cu(I) and benzimidazole units linked via Cu(I)&#8208;imidazole coordination bonds in a cation exchange membrane&#8208;based membrane electrode assembly enables stable acetate electrosynthesis for 190&#160;h, while achieving direct collection of concentrated acetate, an average single&#8208;pass utilization of 50%, and an average acetate full&#8208;cell energy efficiency of 15% at 250&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Upgrading carbon dioxide/monoxide to multi&#8208;carbon C2+ products using renewable electricity offers one route to more sustainable fuel and chemical production. One of the most appealing products is acetate, the profitable electrosynthesis of which demands a catalyst with higher efficiency. Here, a coordination polymer (CP) catalyst is reported that consists of Cu(I) and benzimidazole units linked via Cu(I)&#8208;imidazole coordination bonds, which enables selective reduction of CO to acetate with a 61% Faradaic efficiency at &#8722;0.59 volts versus the reversible hydrogen electrode at a current density of 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in flow cells. The catalyst is integrated in a cation exchange membrane&#8208;based membrane electrode assembly that enables stable acetate electrosynthesis for 190&#160;h, while achieving direct collection of concentrated acetate (3.3 molar) from the cathodic liquid stream, an average single&#8208;pass utilization of 50% toward CO&#8208;to&#8208;acetate conversion, and an average acetate full&#8208;cell energy efficiency of 15% at a current density of 250&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Intracellular Glucose&#8208;Depriving Polymer Micelles for Antiglycolytic Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A glucose&#8208;responsive polymer is designed, considering the unique metabolism of cancer cells. The polymer exhibits micellar&#8208;structure stability during blood circulation and accumulates in tumor tissues. Specific binding between the polymer and intracellular glucose induces glucose deprivation in tumor cells. Glucose metabolism is particularly inhibited; the lack of energy in tumor cells is intensified, leading to tumor suppression.








Abstract
A new anticancer strategy to exploit abnormal metabolism of cancer cells rather than to merely control the drug release or rearrange the tumor microenvironment is reported. An antiglycolytic amphiphilic polymer, designed considering the unique metabolism of cancer cells (Warburg effect) and aimed at the regulation of glucose metabolism, is synthesized through chemical conjugation between glycol chitosan (GC) and phenylboronic acid (PBA). GC&#8208;PBA derivatives form stable micellar structures under physiological conditions and respond to changes in glucose concentration. Once the micelles accumulate at the tumor site, intracellular glucose capture occurs, and the resultant energy deprivation through the inhibition of aerobic glycolysis remarkably suppresses tumor growth without significant side effects in vivo. This strategy highlights the need to develop safe and effective cancer treatment without the use of conventional anticancer drugs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Nanocrystalline Structures from Freestanding Oxide Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scientific exploration of nanomaterials has led to massive growth in understanding and applications of quantum materials at the nanoscale. A route for fabrication of nanocrystalline oxide structures of exceptional quality utilizing self&#8208;assembly of freestanding membranes transferred on appropriate substrates is presented. The microstructure of the nanocrystals exhibits exceptional quality, characterized by a pristine crystal structure and uniform stoichiometry after self&#8208;assembly.








Abstract
The exploration of crystalline nanostructures enhances the understanding of quantum phenomena occurring in spatially confined quantum matter and may lead to functional materials with unforeseen applications. A novel route to fabricating nanocrystalline oxide structures of exceptional quality is presented. This is achieved by utilizing a self&#8208;assembly process of ultrathin membranes composed of the desired oxide. The thermally induced self&#8208;assembly of nanocrystalline structures is driven by dewetting the oxide membranes once they are lifted off and transferred onto sapphire surfaces. In three successive steps, the process provides nanovoids, nanowires, and nanocrystals. Regardless of substrate orientation, the nanostructures are highly anisotropic in shape due to material retraction favoring low&#8208;index crystalline lattice directions of the membranes. The orientation of the nanostructures is provided precisely by the crystal lattice of the transferred membrane. The microstructure of the nanocrystals exhibits exceptional quality, characterized by a pristine crystal structure and uniform stoichiometry, both maintained all the way down to the well&#8208;developed crystalline facets. The demonstrated self&#8208;assembly process holds the potential to improve the understanding of surface diffusion phenomena at the interface of materials, which is important for advancing epitaxial growth technology and paves the way to fabricating crystalline nanostructures by the transfer and self&#8208;assembly of membranes.

         <title>HACS: Helical Auxetic Yarn Capacitive Strain Sensors with Sensitivity Beyond the Theoretical Limit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Capacitive strain sensors are theoretically limited in their sensitivity. In this work, stretchable and flexible strain sensors are fabricated using a helical auxetic yarn structure providing access to auxetic character in the fiber form. The helical auxetic capacitive sensors (HACS) are able to access sensitivity beyond the theoretical limit, determined to be because of an engulfment phenomenon that occurs as a result of the materials employed and the auxetic character.








Abstract
The development of flexible strain sensors over the past decade has focused on accessing high strain percentages and high sensitivity (i.e., gauge factors). Strain sensors that employ capacitance as the electrical signal to correlate to strain are typically restricted in sensitivity because of the Poisson effect. By employing auxetic structures, the limits of sensitivity for capacitive sensors have been exceeded, which has improved the competitiveness of this modality of sensing. In this work, the first employment of helical auxetic yarns as capacitive sensors is presented. It is found that the response of the helical auxetic yarn capacitive sensors (termed as HACS) is dependent on the two main fabrication variables&#8212;the ratio of diameters and the helical wrapping length. Depending on these variables, sensors that respond to strain with increasing or decreasing capacitance values can be obtained. A greater auxetic character results in larger sensitivities accessible at smaller strains&#8212;a characteristic that is not commonly found when accessing high gauge factors. In addition, the highest sensitivity for auxetic capacitive sensors reported thus far is obtained. A mechanism of sensor response that explains both the variable capacitance response and the high gauge factors obtained experimentally is proposed.

         <title>Fully Optical in Operando Investigation of Ambient Condition Electrical Switching in MoS2 Nanodevices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically thin MoS2 electrical switches are characterized for the first time in operando and in ambient conditions through a non&#8208;invasive spectroscopy&#8208;based method. The study sheds light on the &#8211; controversial and still debated &#8211; dynamics driving the switching mechanism. It reveals volatile metallic filaments percolating interatomic spacing in MoS2 and stresses the impact of transfer residues on the electrical performance of switches.








Abstract
MoS2 nanoswitches have shown superb ultralow switching energies without excessive leakage currents. However, the debate about the origin and volatility of electrical switching is unresolved due to the lack of adequate nanoimaging of devices in operando. Here, three optical techniques are combined to perform the first noninvasive in situ characterization of nanosized MoS2 devices. This study reveals volatile threshold resistive switching due to the intercalation of metallic atoms from electrodes directly between Mo and S atoms, without the assistance of sulfur vacancies. A &#8220;semi&#8208;memristive&#8221; effect driven by an organic adlayer adjacent to MoS2 is observed, which suggests that nonvolatility can be achieved by careful interface engineering. These findings provide a crucial understanding of nanoprocess in vertically biased MoS2 nanosheets, which opens new routes to conscious engineering and optimization of 2D electronics.

This study reveals volatile threshold resistive switching due to the intercalation of metallic atoms from electrodes directly between Mo and S atoms, without the assistance of sulfur vacancies. A &#8220;semi-memristive&#8221; effect driven by an organic adlayer adjacent to MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is observed, which suggests that nonvolatility can be achieved by careful interface engineering. These findings provide a crucial understanding of nanoprocess in vertically biased MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets, which opens new routes to conscious engineering and optimization of 2D electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Reconstruction of Conductive Filaments in HfOx&#8208;Based Memristor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conductive filaments (CFs) with different morphologies after forming, set, and reset operations are clearly revealed in HfOx&#8208;based memristors by the 3D reconstruction of c&#8208;AFM technique. Multiple conductive filaments are successfully observed in the devices with three different resistive states. The rupture location of CFs after reset is also observed clearly.








Abstract
HfOx&#8208;based memristor has been studied extensively as one of the most promising memories for the excellent nonvolatile data storage and computing&#8208;in&#8208;memory capabilities. However, the resistive switching mechanism, relying on the formation and rupture of conductive filaments (CFs) during device operations, is still under debate. In this work, the CFs with different morphologies after different operations&#8212;forming, set, and reset&#8212;are clearly revealed for the first time by 3D reconstruction of conductive atomic force microscopy (c&#8208;AFM) images. Intriguingly, multiple CFs are successfully observed in HfOx&#8208;based memristor devices with three different resistive states. CFs after forming, set, and reset exhibit the typical morphologies of hourglass, inverted&#8208;cone, and short&#8208;cone, respectively. The rupture location of CFs after the reset operation is also observed clearly. These findings reveal the microscopic behaviors underlying the resistive switching, which could pave the road to design and optimize oxide&#8208;based memristors for both memory and computing applications.

         <title>Dissolvable Self&#8208;Locking Microneedle Patches Integrated with Immunomodulators for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

         <dc:description>
An advanced projection micro&#8208;stereolithography 3D printer&#8208;based self&#8208;locking dissolvable microneedle is presented as a mass&#8208;producible and cost&#8208;effective transdermal drug delivery platform for precise microdose delivery of drugs in a minimally invasive manner. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a novel combination immunotherapy approach proposed to improve melanoma treatment efficacy shows a significantly higher efficacy when delivered via self&#8208;locking microneedles than intratumoral injection.








Abstract
Advancements in micro&#8208;resolution 3D printers have significantly facilitated the development of highly complex mass&#8208;producible drug delivery platforms. Conventionally, due to the limitations of micro&#8208;milling machineries, dissolvable microneedles (MNs) are mainly fabricated in cone&#8208;shaped geometry with limited drug delivery accuracy. Herein, to overcome the limitations of conventional MNs, a novel projection micro&#8208;stereolithography 3D printer&#8208;based self&#8208;locking MN for precise skin insertion, adhesion, and transcutaneous microdose drug delivery is presented. The geometry of self&#8208;locking MN consists of a sharp skin&#8208;penetrating tip, a wide skin interlocking body, and a narrow base with mechanical supports fabricated over a flexible hydrocolloid patch to improve the accuracy of skin penetration into irregular surfaces. Melanoma, a type of skin cancer, is selected as the model for the investigation of self&#8208;locking MNs due to its irregular and uneven surface. In vivo immunotherapy efficacy is evaluated by integrating SD&#8208;208, a novel transforming growth factor&#8208;&#946; (TGF&#8208;&#946;) inhibitor that suppresses the proliferation and metastasis of tumors, and anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 (aPD&#8208;L1 Ab), an immune checkpoint inhibitor that induces T cell&#8208;mediated tumor cell death, into self&#8208;locking MNs and comparing them with intratumoral injection. Evaluation of (aPD&#8208;L1 Ab)/SD&#8208;208 delivery effectiveness in B16F10 melanoma&#8208;bearing mice model confirms significantly improved dose efficacy of self&#8208;locking MNs compared with intratumoral injection.

         <title>Holographically Activatable Nanoprobe via Glutathione/Albumin&#8208;Mediated Exponential Signal Amplification for High&#8208;Contrast Tumor Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A holographically activatable nanoprobe caging manganese tetraoxide is reported for tumor&#8208;selective contrast enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging, which is accomplished through both glutathione/albumin&#8208;mediated cascade signal amplification in tumors and rapid elimination in normal tissues.








Abstract
Glutathione (GSH)&#8208;activatable probes hold great promise for in vivo cancer imaging, but are restricted by their dependence on non&#8208;selective intracellular GSH enrichment and uncontrollable background noise. Here, a holographically activatable nanoprobe caging manganese tetraoxide is shown for tumor&#8208;selective contrast enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) through cooperative GSH/albumin&#8208;mediated cascade signal amplification in tumors and rapid elimination in normal tissues. Once targeting tumors, the endocytosed nanoprobe effectively senses the lysosomal microenvironment to undergo instantaneous decomposition into Mn2+ with threshold GSH concentration of &#8776; 0.12&#160;mm for brightening MRI signals, thus achieving high contrast tumor imaging and flexible monitoring of GSH&#8208;relevant cisplatin resistance during chemotherapy. Upon efficient up&#8208;regulation of extracellular GSH in&#160;tumor via exogenous injection, the relaxivity&#8208;silent interstitial nanoprobe remarkably evolves into Mn2+ that are further captured/retained and re&#8208;activated into ultrahigh&#8208;relaxivity&#8208;capable complex by stromal albumin in the tumor, and simultaneously allows the renal clearance of off&#8208;targeted nanoprobe in the form of Mn2+ via lymphatic vessels for suppressing background noise to distinguish tiny liver metastasis. These findings demonstrate the concept of holographic tumor activation via both tumor GSH/albumin&#8208;mediated cascade signal amplification and simultaneous background suppression for precise tumor malignancy detection, surveillance, and surgical guidance.

         <title>Cooperative Electronic Structure Modulator of Fe Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalyst for High Energy and Long Cycle Li&#8211;S Pouch Cell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of electron exchangeable binding sites comprising thiophene S and oxidized S, adjacent to Fe single atom electrocatalysts, improves Li2S redox kinetics by modulating d&#8208;orbital level of Fe single atom via electron exchange. These specially designed electrocatalysts enable realization of a 1 A h level Li&#8211;S pouch cell with high gravimetric energy density and long cycle stability.








Abstract
High&#8208;energy and long cycle lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) pouch cells are limited by the insufficient capacities and stabilities of their cathodes under practical electrolyte/sulfur (E/S), electrolyte/capacity (E/C), and negative/positive (N/P) ratios. Herein, an advanced cathode comprising highly active Fe single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is reported to form 320.2&#160;W h kg&#8722;1 multistacked Li&#8211;S pouch cells with total capacity of &#8776;1 A h level, satisfying low E/S (3.0), E/C (2.8), and N/P (2.3) ratios and high sulfur loadings (8.4&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). The high&#8208;activity Fe SAC is designed by manipulating its local environments using electron&#8208;exchangeable binding (EEB) sites. Introducing EEB sites comprising two different types of S species, namely, thiophene&#8208;like&#8208;S (&#8211;S) and oxidized&#8208;S (&#8211;SO2), adjacent to Fe SACs promotes the kinetics of the Li2S redox reaction by providing additional binding sites and modulating the Fe d&#8208;orbital levels via electron exchange with Fe. The &#8211;S donates the electrons to the Fe SACs, whereas &#8211;SO2 withdraws electrons from the Fe SACs. Thus, the Fe d&#8208;orbital energy level can be modulated by the different &#8211;SO2/&#8211;S ratios of the EEB site, controlling the electron donating/withdrawing characteristics. This desirable electrocatalysis is maximized by the intimate contact of the Fe SACs with the S species, which are confined together in porous carbon.

         <title>Modular Approach to Creating Functionalized Surface Arrays of Molecular Qubits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method to create 2D arrays of molecular spin qubits is reported. The quantum properties are retained and the quantum coherence times are improved compared to bulk conditions.








Abstract
The quest for developing quantum technologies is driven by the promise of exponentially faster computations, ultrahigh performance sensing, and achieving thorough understanding of many&#8208;particle quantum systems. Molecular spins are excellent qubit candidates because they feature long coherence times, are widely tunable through chemical synthesis, and can be interfaced with other quantum platforms such as superconducting qubits. A present challenge for molecular spin qubits is their integration in quantum devices, which requires arranging them in thin films or monolayers on surfaces. However, clear proof of the survival of quantum properties of molecular qubits on surfaces has not been reported so far. Furthermore, little is known about the change in spin dynamics of molecular qubits going from the bulk to monolayers. Here, a versatile bottom&#8208;up method is reported to arrange molecular qubits as functional groups of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) on surfaces, combining molecular self&#8208;organization and click chemistry. Coherence times of up to 13 &#181;s demonstrate that qubit properties are maintained or even enhanced in the monolayer.

         <title>Solvation and Interfacial Engineering Enable &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C Operation of Graphite/NCM Batteries at Energy Density over 270 Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1</title>

Kinetic barriers related to Li+ transport at low temperatures is knocked down by formulating a weakly&#8208;solvated electrolyte containing Na+ as a hetero&#8208;cation additive, where a Li&#8208;Na hybrid SEI is identified to favor Li+ migration through the multiple LiF/NaF grain boundaries. As such, the electrolyte affords a 2 Ah, 270&#160;Wh&#160;Kg&#8722;1 graphite/NCM523 pouch cell with discharge capacity of 108.7 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C.








Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) that can operate under low temperature (LT) conditions are essential for applications in orbital missions, subsea areas, and electric vehicles. Unfortunately, severe capacity loss is witnessed due to tremendous kinetic barriers that emerge at LT. Herein, to surmount such kinetic limitations, a low dielectric environment is tamed throughout the bulk electrolyte, which efficaciously brought the Li+ desolvation energy down to 30.76 kJ&#160;mol&#8722;1. At the meantime, the adoption of sodium cations (Na+) is proposed as a hetero&#8208;cation additive, and a Li&#8208;Na hybrid and fluoride&#8208;rich interphase is further identified via preferential reduction of Na+&#8208;(solvent/anion) clusters, which is found to efficiently facilitate Li+ migration through the LiF/NaF grain boundaries. Based on a N/P ratio of 1.1, the graphite/LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM) full cell (cathode loading of &#8776;18.5&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2) delivers a capacity as high as 125.1 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 under &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C with prolonged cycling to 100 cycles. Finally, a 270&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 graphite/NCM pouch cell is assembled, which affords a discharge capacity of 108.7 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 under &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C during the initial cycles. With an eye to both fundamental and practical aspects, this work will propel additional advancements and allow LIBs to fill more roles under extreme operation temperatures than ever before.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Reaction Heterogeneity During Calcination of Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;temperature calcination used for Li&#8208;ion battery particle synthesis is chemically imaged. Various parallel and serial combinations of heterogeneous reactions, such as the thermal aerobic/anaerobic decomposition, Li2CO3 decomposition, Li2&#8208;O insertion/diffusion, and O2 insertion/diffusion, prevail during the calcination reaction. The anaerobic decomposition of the precursor core slows down Li2&#8208;O incorporation.








Abstract
During solid&#8208;state calcination, with increasing temperature, materials undergo complex phase transitions with heterogeneous solid&#8208;state reactions and mass transport. Precise control of the calcination chemistry is therefore crucial for synthesizing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides (LiNi1&#8208;x&#8208;yCoxMnyO2, NRNCM) as cathode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Although the battery performance depends on the chemical heterogeneity during NRNCM calcination, it has not yet been elucidated. Herein, through synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray, mass spectrometry microscopy, and structural analyses, it is revealed that the temperature&#8208;dependent reaction kinetics, the diffusivity of solid&#8208;state lithium sources, and the ambient oxygen control the local chemical compositions of the reaction intermediates within a calcined particle. Additionally, it is found that the variations in the reducing power of the transition metals (i.e., Ni, Co, and Mn) determine the local structures at the nanoscale. The investigation of the reaction mechanism via imaging analysis provides valuable information for tuning the calcination chemistry and developing high&#8208;energy/power density lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>In Situ Absorption Characterization Guided Slot&#8208;Die&#8208;Coated High&#8208;Performance Large&#8208;Area Flexible Organic Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ absorption measurement is used to investigate the aggregation behavior of acceptors during slot&#8208;die&#8208;coating. The 1 cm2 flexible device can reach a power conversion efficiency of 13.70%, with excellent shelf stability and upscaling ability. The connected modules (180 cm2) can effectively power a smartphone, showing great potential for future applications.








Abstract
Slot&#8208;die coating is recognized as the most compatible method for the roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll (R2R) processing of large&#8208;area flexible organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the photovoltaic performance of large&#8208;area flexible OSC lags significantly behind that of traditional spin&#8208;coating devices. In this work, two acceptors, Qx&#8208;1 and Qx&#8208;2, show quite different film&#8208;formation kinetics in the slot&#8208;die coating process. In situ absorption spectroscopy indicates that the excessive crystallinity of Qx&#8208;2 provides early phase separation and early aggregation, resulting in oversized crystal domains. Consequently, the PM6:Qx&#8208;1&#8208;based 1&#160;cm2 flexible device exhibits an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.70%, which is the best performance among the slot&#8208;die&#8208;coated flexible devices; in contrast, the PM6:Qx&#8208;2 blend shows a pretty poor efficiency, which is lower than 1%. Moreover, the 30 cm2 modules based on PM6:Qx&#8208;1, containing six 5 cm2 sub&#8208;cells, exhibit a PCE of 12.20%. After being stored in a glove box for over 6000&#160;h, the PCE remains at 103% of its initial values, indicating excellent shelf stability. Therefore, these results show a promising future strategy for the upscaling fabrication of flexible large&#8208;area OSCs.

         <title>Over 19% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells by Regulating Multidimensional Intermolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermolecular interactions are ubiquitous and elusive in organic solar cells. Herein, the complicated relationship between multidimensional intermolecular interactions in active layers and photovoltaic performance is disclosed. The results show that complex interactions are critical to synergistically regulating comprehensive properties, including molecular assembly, stacking orientations, charge transport, and morphology management, which helps to achieve an efficiency over 19% in ternary devices.








Abstract
Research on organic solar cells (OSCs) has progressed through material innovation and device engineering. However, well&#8208;known and ubiquitous intermolecular interactions, and particularly their synergistic effects, have received little attention. Herein, the complicated relationship between photovoltaic conversion and multidimensional intermolecular interactions in the active layers is investigated. These interactions are dually regulated by side&#8208;chain isomerization and end&#8208;cap engineering of the acceptors. The phenylalkyl featured acceptors (LA&#8208;series) exhibit stronger crystallinity with preferential face&#8208;on interactions relative to the alkylphenyl attached isomers (ITIC&#8208;series). In addition, the PM6&#160;and LA&#8208;series acceptors exhibit moderate donor/acceptor interactions compared to those of the strongly interacting PM6/ITIC&#8208;series pairs, which helps to enhance phase separation and charge transport. Consequently, the output efficiencies of all LA series acceptors are over 14%. Moreover, LA&#8208;series acceptors show appropriate compatibility, host/guest interactions, and crystallinity relationships with BTP&#8208;eC9, thereby leading to uniform and well&#8208;organized &#8220;alloy&#8208;like&#8221; mixed phases. In particular, the highly crystalline LA23&#160;further optimizes multiple interactions and ternary microstructures, which results in a high efficiency of 19.12%. Thus, these results highlight the importance of multidimensional intermolecular interactions in the photovoltaic performance of OSCs.

Capacitive Strain Sensors
In article number 2209321, Tyler J. Cuthbert, Carlo Menon, and co&#8208;workers present a novel capacitive strain sensor that accesses sensitivity beyond the theoretical limit. The helical auxetic capacitive sensor (HACS) employs a two&#8208;component yarn structure allowing tuneable sensitivity and accessible strain ranges. The HACS sensitivity is found to be from an engulfment phenomenon, which is predicted with a geometric model and analyzed by X&#8208;ray &#956;CT scanning.

Nonlinear Hall Effect
As the heart and with the tremendous applications of terahertz technology, photodetectors suffer from considerable drawbacks imposed by weak optical absorption, and inefficient charge&#8208;separation mechanisms. In article number 2209557, Antonio Politano, Lin Wang, and co&#8208;workers report the nonlinear Hall effect operating at terahertz frequencies within strong spin&#8208;polarized topological states in CoTe2 without invoking any semiconductor junctions or bias voltage, opening up fascinating route toward quantum wavefunction engineering.

Cathode Calcination
In article number 2207076, Sugeun Jo, Keeyoung Jung, Jongwoo Lim, and co&#8208;workers show how solid&#8208;state reaction heterogeneity affects the high&#8208;temperature calcination of Li&#8208;ion battery particles. Various parallel and serial combinations of the thermal (an)aerobic decomposition and Li2&#8211;O insertion/diffusion are chemically imaged during the calcination reaction. The cover image features the calcination intermediates that facilitate the surface Li2&#8211;O incorporation, which is impeded by the anaerobically decomposed phase in the particle core.

         <title>As Fiber Meets with AIE: Opening a Wonderland for Smart Flexible Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) and fiber complement each other for making remarkble progress in smart flexible materials. This article provides a comprehensive and fundamental overview of the basic concepts, structure&#8208;function relationship, seminal and recent studies, and the potential directions for future developments regarding AIEgen&#8208;based fiber from the view of mesoscale and macroscale.








Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) have recently been developed at a tremendous pace in the area of organic luminescent materials by virtue of their superior properties. However, the practical applications of AIEgens still face the challenge of transforming AIEgens from molecules into materials. Till now, many AIEgens have been integrated into fiber, endowing the fiber with prominent fluorescence and/or photosensitizing capacities. AIEgens and fiber complement each other for making progress in flexible smart materials, in which the utilization of AIEgens creates new application possibilities for fiber, and the fiber provides an excellent carrier for AIEgens towards realizing the conversion from molecule to materials and an ideal platform to research the aggregate state of AIEgens in mesoscale and macroscale. This review begins with a brief summary of the recent advances related to some typical AIEgens with various functions and the technology for the fabrication of AIEgen&#8208;functionalized fiber. The most representative applications are then highlighted by focusing on energy conversion, personal protective equipment, biomedical, sensor, and fluorescence&#8208;related fields. Finally, the challenges, opportunities, and tendencies in future development are discussed in detail. This review hopes to inspire innovation in AIEgens and fiber from the view of mesoscale and macroscale.

         <title>Photoresponsive Supramolecular Polymers: From Light&#8208;Controlled Small Molecules to Smart Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Control over supramolecular interactions is an important part of the toolbox for developing functional materials. The design of supramolecular polymers with light&#8208;triggered molecules allows remote control of supramolecular polymers and materials with high spatiotemporal precision. Here, a perspective review of various approaches and major advances toward photoresponsive supramolecular polymers with controlled functions is presented.








Abstract
Photoresponsive supramolecular polymers are well&#8208;organized assemblies based on highly oriented and reversible noncovalent interactions containing photosensitive molecules as (co&#8208;)monomers. They have attracted increasing interest in smart materials and dynamic systems with precisely controllable functions, such as light&#8208;driven soft actuators, photoresponsive fluorescent anticounterfeiting and light&#8208;triggered electronic devices. The present review discusses light&#8208;activated molecules used in photoresponsive supramolecular polymers with their main photo&#8208;induced changes, e.g., geometry, dipole moment, and chirality. Based on these distinct changes, supramolecular polymers formed by light&#8208;activated molecules exhibit photoresponsive disassembly and reassembly. As a consequence, photo&#8208;induced supramolecular polymerization, &#8220;depolymerization,&#8221; and regulation of the lengths and topologies are observed. Moreover, the light&#8208;controlled functions of supramolecular polymers, such as actuation, emission, and chirality transfer along length scales, are highlighted. Furthermore, a perspective on challenges and future opportunities is presented. Besides the challenge of moving from harmful UV light to visible/near IR light avoiding fatigue, and enabling biomedical applications, future opportunities include light&#8208;controlled supramolecular actuators with helical motion, light&#8208;modulated information transmission, optically recyclable materials, and multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular systems.

A transcytosis&#8208;targeting peptide&#8208;decorated reconfigurable liposome (LPGL) is capable of ultrasound&#8208;induced liposomal reassembly and protein&#8208;corona decortication. Ultrasound irradiation induces size&#8208;transformation of the LPGL and decorticates the surface protein corona by lipid membrane reassembly, whereby the capability to recognize the receptors on tumor neovascularization is regained, ligand/receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis is initiated, and efficient tumor accumulation and penetration is achieved, leading to potent antitumor activity.








Abstract
Ligand/receptor&#8208;mediated targeted drug delivery has been widely recognized as a promising strategy for improving the clinical efficacy of&#160;nanomedicines but is attenuated by the binding of plasma protein on the surface of nanoparticles to form a protein corona. Here, it is shown that ultrasonic cavitation can be used to unravel surface plasma coronas on liposomal nanoparticles through ultrasound (US)&#8208;induced liposomal reassembly. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the method, transcytosis&#8208;targeting&#8208;peptide&#8208;decorated reconfigurable liposomes (LPGLs) loaded with gemcitabine (GEM) and perfluoropentane (PFP) are developed for cancer&#8208;targeted therapy. In the blood circulation, the targeting peptides are deactivated by the plasma corona and lose their targeting capability. Once they reach tumor blood vessels, US irradiation induces transformation of the LPGLs from nanodrops into microbubbles via liquid&#8211;gas phase transition and decorticate the surface corona by reassembly of the lipid membrane. The activated liposomes regain the capability to recognize the receptors on tumor neovascularization, initiate ligand/receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis, achieve efficient tumor accumulation and penetration, and lead to potent antitumor activity in multiple tumor models of patient&#8208;derived tumor xenografts. This study presents an effective strategy to tackle the fluid biological barriers of the protein corona and develop transcytosis&#8208;targeting liposomes for active tumor transport and efficient cancer therapy.

         <title>Realizing Highly Efficient Sonodynamic Bactericidal Capability through the Phonon&#8211;Electron Coupling Effect Using Two&#8208;Dimensional Catalytic Planar Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D catalytic planar defects have been rationally designed and engineered for reversing the ultrasonic silence of Ti3C2, dramatically realizing the highly efficient sonodynamic bactericidal therapy. It is unveiled that the electron's origin, electron transfer, and the visible O2&#160;activation pathway triggered by ultrasound are attributed to the phonon&#8211;electron coupling effect.








Abstract
Conferring catalytic defects in sonosensitizers is of paramount importance in reinforcing sonodynamic therapy. However, the formation of such 0D defects is governed by the Schottky defect principle. Herein, 2D catalytic planar defects are designed within Ti3C2&#160;sheets to address this challenge. These specific planar slip dislocations with abundant Ti3+ species (Ti3C2&#8208;SD(Ti3+)) can yield surface&#8208;bound O due to the effective activation of O2, thus resulting in a substantial amount of 1O2&#160;generation and the 99.72%&#160;&#177;&#160;0.03% bactericidal capability subject to ultrasound (US) stimulation. It is discovered that the 2D catalytic planar defects can intervene in electron transfer through the phonon drag effect&#8212;a coupling effect between surface electrons and US&#8208;triggered phonons&#8212;that simultaneously contributes to a dramatic decrease in O2&#160;activation energy from 1.65&#160;to 0.06&#160;eV. This design has achieved a qualitative leap in which the US catalytic site has transformed from 0D to 2D. Moreover, it is revealed that the electron origin, electron transfer, and visible O2&#160;activation pathway triggered by US can be attributed to the phonon&#8211;electron coupling effect. After coating with neutrophil membrane (NM) proteins, the NM&#8208;Ti3C2&#8208;SD(Ti3+) sheets further demonstrate a 6&#8208;log10&#160;reduction in methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus burden in the infected bony tissue.

         <title>Highly Stretchable and Biocompatible Wrinkled Nanoclay&#8208;Composite Hydrogel With Enhanced Sensing Capability for Precise Detection of Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel bioinspired nanoclay&#8208;composite wrinkled hydrogel sensor is developed with excellent mechanical and biocompatible properties and high and reliable sensing capacity due to the structural&#8211;mechanical&#8211;electrical integrity of the wrinkle micropattern and nanoclay&#8208;reinforced interpenetrating crosslinked network. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, this hydrogel sensor can accurately localize the region where myocardial infarction occurs, showing promise for real&#8208;time monitoring of pathological heart tissue.








Abstract
It is challenging to balance high biocompability with good mechanical&#8211;electrical sensing performance, especially when triggering inflammatory stress response after in vivo implantation. Herein, a bioinspired wrinkle&#8208;reinforced adaptive nanoclay&#8208;interlocked soft strain&#8208;sensor based on a highly stretchable and elastic ionic&#8208;conductive hydrogel is reported. This novel nanoclay&#8208;composite hydrogel exhibits excellent tensile properties and high sensing capacity with steady and reliable sensing performance due to the structural&#8211;mechanical&#8211;electrical integrity of the nanoclay crosslinked and nano&#8208;reinforced interpenetrating network. The incorporation of amphiphilic ions provides the hydrogel with significant protein resistance, reducing its non&#8208;specific adsorption to proteins upon implantation, improving its biosafety as an implanted device, and maintaining the authenticity of the sensing results. Based on the revealed sensing enhanced mechanism based on hierarchical ordered structures as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, this hydrogel sensor is demonstrated to be able to&#160;accurately localize the region where myocardial infarction occurs and may become a novel strategy for real&#8208;time monitoring of pathological changes in heart disease.

         <title>Synergistic Surface Modification of Tin&#8211;Lead Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
Synergistic surface modification of mixed Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite films by the combination of piperazine and C60 pyrrolidine tris&#8208;acid realizes narrow&#8208;bandgap solar cells with power conversion efficiencies up to 22.7% and substantially elongated stability.








Abstract
Interfaces in thin&#8208;film photovoltaics play a pivotal role in determining device efficiency and longevity. In this work, the top surface treatment of mixed tin&#8211;lead (&#8776;1.26&#160;eV) halide perovskite films for p&#8211;i&#8211;n solar cells is studied. Charge extraction is promoted by treating the perovskite surface with piperazine. This compound reacts with the organic cations at the perovskite surface, modifying the surface structure and tuning the interfacial energy level alignment. In addition, the combined treatment with C60 pyrrolidine tris&#8208;acid (CPTA) reduces hysteresis and leads to efficiencies up to 22.7%, with open&#8208;circuit voltage values reaching 0.90&#160;V, &#8776;92% of the radiative limit for the bandgap of this material. The modified cells also show superior stability, with unencapsulated cells retaining 96% of their initial efficiency after &gt;2000 h of storage in N2 and encapsulated cells retaining 90% efficiency after &gt;450 h of storage in air. Intriguingly, CPTA preferentially binds to Sn2+ sites at film surface over Pb2+ due to the energetically favored exposure of the former, according to first&#8208;principles calculations. This work provides new insights into the surface chemistry of perovskite films in terms of their structural, electronic, and defect characteristics and this knowledge is used to fabricate state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art solar cells.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment of a magnetic skyrmion transistor is presented using spatially uniform voltage&#8208;controlled magnetic anisotropy. A gate operation can control the translational motion of a magnetic skyrmion. Utilizing the gate&#8208;controlled skyrmion motion technique, the authors expect various skyrmion logic devices to be demonstrated in the future.

The invention of the spin&#8208;information transistor is expected to be an essential building block for the future development of spintronics. Here, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment of a magnetic skyrmion transistor working at room temperature, which has never been demonstrated experimentally, is introduced. With the spatially uniform control of magnetic anisotropy, the shape and topology of a skyrmion when passing the controlled area can be maintained. The findings will open a new route toward the design and realization of skyrmion&#8208;based spintronic devices in the near future.

&lt;p&gt;A proof-of-concept experiment of a magnetic skyrmion transistor is presented using spatially uniform voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy. A gate operation can control the translational motion of a magnetic skyrmion. Utilizing the gate-controlled skyrmion motion technique, the authors expect various skyrmion logic devices to be demonstrated in the future.

         <dc:description>
By synthesizing a high weight&#8208;average molecular weight polymer donor PBDB&#8208;TF and combining a ternary blending strategy, favorable phase separation morphology featuring more compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance can be attained. A maximum power conversion efficiency of 18.2% (certified value of 17.7%) with excellent mechanical properties in all&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaic cells is demonstrated.








Abstract
All&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells possessing high photovoltaic performance and mechanical robustness are promising candidates for flexible wearable devices. However, developing photoactive materials with good mechanical properties and photovoltaic performance so far remains challenging. In this work, a polymer donor PBDB&#8208;TF with a high weight&#8208;average molecular weight (Mw) is introduced to enable highly efficient all&#8208;polymer OPV cells featuring excellent mechanical reliability. By incorporating the high&#8208;Mw PBDB&#8208;TF as a third component into the PBQx&#8208;TF:PY&#8208;IT blend, the bulk heterojunction morphology is finely tuned with a more compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance, affording efficient pathways for charge transport as well as mechanical stress dissipation. Hence, all&#8208;polymer OPV cells based on the ternary blend film demonstrate a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.2% with an outstanding fill factor of 0.796. The flexible OPV cell delivers a decent PCE of 16.5% with high mechanical stability. These results present a promising strategy to address the mechanical properties and boost the photovoltaic performance of all&#8208;polymer OPV cells.

         <title>Engineered Switchable&#8208;Wettability Surfaces for Multi&#8208;Path Directional Transportation of Droplets and Subaqueous Bubbles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D dumbbell&#8208;patterned functional surface featured by switchable wettability is proposed to achieve the multi&#8208;path parallel directional transportation of both water droplets and subaqueous bubbles. This programmable, easy&#8208;fabricable, highly&#8208;efficient, and cost&#8208;effective fluidic system with strong robustness against structural defects is ready for versatile fluid transportation supporting both liquid&#8208; and gas&#8208;phase matters.








Abstract
Conventional engineered surfaces for fluid manipulation are hindered by the set wettability, and thus they can only achieve spontaneous transport of single&#8208;phase fluid, namely liquid or gas. Moreover, fluid transport systems that are robust to path defects have yet to be fully explored. Here, unprecedentedly, a universal wettability switching strategy is developed for achieving programmable directional transport of both droplets and subaqueous bubbles on a dumbbell&#8208;patterned functional surface (DPFS), featuring in strong robustness, high efficiency, and effective cost. By tuning the superwettability of DPFS through octadecyltrichlorosilane treatment and ultraviolet&#8208;C selective irradiation, the transport fluid can alternate between liquid and gas. The material's switchable superwettability regulates the fluid directed dynamics within the confined pattern, in which the sustaining fluid propelling relies on the surface energy difference between the starting and terminal sites. This enables the construction of multiple channels, which works synergistically with ultralow&#8208;volume&#8208;loss transport to impart the fluidic system with strong robustness against path defects. Underlying the completion of complex microfluidics tasks, spatially&#8208;selective cooling devices and subaqueous gas microreactors are successfully demonstrated. This energy&#8208;consumption&#8208;free fluid transport system opens a new avenue for on&#8208;chip programmable fluid manipulation, promoting innovative applications requiring rational control of two&#8208;phase fluid transport.

         <title>Efficient Red Light Emitting Diodes Based on a Zero&#8208;Dimensional Organic Antimony Halide Hybrid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly luminescent zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic antimony bromide hybrid containing semiconducting organic cation is developed for the first time, with which electrically driven red light emitting diodes (LEDs) are fabricated to exhibit an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.12%, a peak luminance of 5957&#160;cd m&#8722;2, and a current efficiency of 14.2 cd A&#8722;1.








Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs) have recently emerged as a new class of light emitting materials with exceptional color tunability. While near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum efficiencies (PLQEs) are routinely obtained for a large number of 0D OMHHs, it remains challenging to apply them as emitter for electrically driven light emitting diodes (LEDs), largely due to the low conductivity of wide bandgap organic cations. Here, the development of a new OMHH, triphenyl(9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl) phosphonium antimony bromide (TPPcarzSbBr4), as emitter for efficient LEDs, which consists of semiconducting organic cations (TPPcarz+) and light emitting antimony bromide anions (Sb2Br82&#8722;), is reported. By replacing one of the phenyl groups in a well&#8208;known tetraphenylphosphonium cation (TPP+) with an electroactive phenylcarbazole group, a semiconducting TPPcarz+ cation is developed for the preparation of red emitting 0D TPPcarzSbBr4 single crystals with a high PLQE of 93.8%. With solution processed TPPcarzSbBr4 thin films (PLQE of 86.1%) as light emitting layer, red LEDs are fabricated to exhibit an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.12%, a peak luminance of 5957&#160;cd m&#8722;2, and a current efficiency of 14.2&#160;cd A&#8722;1, which are the best values reported to date for electroluminescence devices based on 0D OMHHs.

         <title>Construction of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Films via Crosslinking&#8208;Induced Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small clusters in the early growth steps of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can be stabilized by modulators to form fluidic precursors (denoted as preMOFs) with good processibility. Then, the removal of solvents and modulators will trigger the crosslinking of preMOFs and lead to the formation of continuous MOF films.








Abstract
The construction of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films is a crucial step for integrating them into technical applications. However, due to the crystallization nature, it is difficult to grow most MOFs spontaneously or process them into films. Here, a convenient strategy is demonstrated for constructing MOF films by using modulators to achieve homogeneous assembly of MOF clusters. Small clusters in the early growth steps of MOFs can be stabilized by modulators to form fluidic precursors with good processibility. Then, simple removal of modulators will trigger the crosslinking of MOF clusters and lead to the formation of continuous films. This strategy is universal for the fabrication of several types of MOF films with large scale and controllable thickness, which can be deposited on a variety of substrates as well as can be patterned in micro/nano resolution. Additionally, versatile composite MOF films can be easily synthesized by introducing functional materials during the crosslinking process, which brings them broader application prospects.

         <title>Microscale Combinatorial Libraries for the Discovery of High&#8208;Entropy Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microscale combinatorial libraries are introduced as a new method for exploration of polyelemental material systems. Composition gradients of quinary material systems are produced and characterized for crystal properties and electrocatalytic activity. The small dimensions of microscale combinatorial libraries enable efficient screening of thousands of compositions. Highly active electrocatalysts are identified in the systems Ru&#8211;Rh&#8211;Pd&#8211;Ir&#8211;Pt and Co&#8211;Ni&#8211;Mo&#8211;Pd&#8211;Pt.








Abstract
Polyelemental material systems, specifically high&#8208;entropy alloys, promise unprecedented properties. Due to almost unlimited combinatorial possibilities, their exploration and exploitation is hard. This challenge is addressed by co&#8208;sputtering combined with shadow masking to produce a multitude of microscale combinatorial libraries in one deposition process. These thin&#8208;film composition spreads on the microscale cover unprecedented compositional ranges of high&#8208;entropy alloy systems and enable high&#8208;throughput characterization of thousands of compositions for electrocatalytic energy conversion reactions using nanoscale scanning electrochemical cell microscopy. The exemplary exploration of the composition space of two high&#8208;entropy alloy systems provides electrocatalytic activity maps for hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution as well as oxygen reduction reactions. Activity optima in the system Ru&#8211;Rh&#8211;Pd&#8211;Ir&#8211;Pt are identified, and active noble&#8208;metal lean compositions in the system Co&#8211;Ni&#8211;Mo&#8211;Pd&#8211;Pt are discovered. This illustrates that the proposed microlibraries are a holistic discovery platform to master the multidimensionality challenge of polyelemental systems.

         <title>Unusual Spectrally Reproducible and High Q&#8208;Factor Random Lasing in Polycrystalline Tin Perovskite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly spectrally reproducible multimode random lasing is observed in thin polycrystalline films of tin iodide perovskite that cannot be explained by a strong mode localization. The observed spectral reproducibility can be due to the strong inhomogeneous broadening of photoluminescence spectra measured in tin&#8208;based perovskites on the basis of a comparison with an analogous Pb&#8208;based counterpart.








Abstract
An unusual spectrally reproducible near&#8208;IR random lasing (RL) with no fluctuation of lasing peak wavelength is disclosed in polycrystalline films of formamidinium tin triiodide perovskite, which have been chemically stabilized against Sn2+ to Sn4+ oxidation. Remarkably, a quality Q&#8208;factor as high as &#8776;104 with an amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) threshold as low as 2&#160;&#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2 (both at 20&#160;K) are achieved. The observed spectral reproducibility is unprecedented for semiconductor thin film RL systems and cannot be explained by the strong spatial localization of lasing modes. Instead, it is suggested that the spectral stability is a result of such an unique property of Sn&#8208;based perovskites as a large inhomogeneous broadening of the emitting centers, which is a consequence of an intrinsic structural inhomogeneity of the material. Due to this, lasing can occur simultaneously in modes that are spatially strongly overlapped, as long as the spectral separation between the modes is larger than the homogeneous linewidth of the emitting centers. The discovered mechanism of RL spectral stability in semiconductor materials, possessing inhomogeneous broadening, opens up prospects for their practical use as cheap sources of narrow laser lines.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Organohydrogel Artificial Muscle with Compartmentalized Anisotropic Actuation Under Microdomain Confinement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organohydrogel actuator achieving the combination of high speed, high actuation strength, and large material size is proposed. The water is confined in hydrophobic microdomains in organohydrogel, thus realizing a compartmentalization actuation mode similar to muscle. This strategy can break through the limitations that originated from the traditional solvent diffusion actuation mechanism, inspiring gel actuator design.








Abstract
Current hydrogel actuators mostly suffer from weak actuation strength and low responsive speed owing to their solvent diffusion&#8208;induced volume change mechanism. Here a skeletal muscle&#8208;inspired organohydrogel actuator is reported in which solvents are confined in hydrophobic microdomains. Organohydrogel actuator is driven by compartmentalized directional network deformation instead of volume change, avoiding the limitations that originate from solvent diffusion. Organohydrogel actuator has an actuation frequency of 0.11&#160;Hz, 110 times that of traditional solvent diffusion&#8208;driven hydrogel actuators (&lt;10&#8722;3&#160;Hz), and can lift more than 85 times their own weight. This design achieves the combination of high responsive speed, high actuation strength, and large material size, proposing a strategy to fabricate hydrogel actuators comparable with skeletal muscle performance.

         <title>Direct Conversion of Liquid Organic Precursor into 3D Laser&#8208;Induced Graphene Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A goal in graphene synthesis is to establish routes for preparing graphene materials from liquids instead of conventional solid or gaseous sources. This work reports the production of graphene materials with tunable composition directly from liquid precursor. A fundamentally new graphene 3D&#8208;printing system is further developed for constructing 3D graphene materials with high structural integrity unachievable by traditional printing strategy.








Abstract
Among the different states of matter, liquids have particular advantages in terms of easy handling and recycling, which has been manifested in various chemosynthetic reactions, but remains underexplored in graphene synthesis. This work reports the direct conversion of liquid organic precursor into versatile 3D graphene materials using rapid laser irradiation. The liquid precursor allows for easy fabrication of graphene with significant 3D architectures, including powders, patterned composite structures, and substrate&#8208;free films. Taking advantage of the high compatibility of liquid precursor with a wide range of dopants, the 3D graphene can be further engineered together with various functional components, especially the high loading (&#8776;15 wt.%) and well&#8208;dispersed (an average diameter of less than 50&#160;nm) high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles. Furthermore, combined with the 3D printing strategy, the rapid construction of graphene with complex and accurate 3D shapes is demonstrated via a selective in situ laser transforming (SLT) strategy. With the high structural integrity unachievable by traditional 3D printing methods, the obtained objects show an electrical conductivity of 4380 S&#160;m&#8722;1 and a compressive modulus of 31.8&#160;MPa. The results reported in this work will open up a new way for the fabrication of functional carbon materials with customizable shapes and components.

         <title>Bioengineering of High Cell Density Tissues with Hierarchical Vascular Networks for Ex Vivo Whole Organs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method is shown to fabricate an in vitro model of millimeter&#8208;sized scaffold&#8208;free tissues whose cell density is &#8776;200 million cells mL&#8722;1, corresponding to those of native tissues. The supply of oxygen and nutrition is extremely significant for such tissues. Therefore, a hierarchical vascular network containing capillaries and an artificial channel for perfusion are formed.








Abstract
The development of tissue&#8208;like structures such as cell sheets, spheroids, and organoids has contributed to progress in regenerative medicine. Simultaneous achievement of scale up and high cell density of these tissues is challenging because sufficient oxygen cannot be supplied to the inside of large, high cell density tissues. Here, in vitro fabrication of vessels to supply oxygen to the inside of millimeter&#8208;sized scaffold&#8208;free tissues whose cell density is &#8776;200 million cells mL&#8722;1, corresponding to those of native tissues, is shown. Hierarchical vascular networks by anastomosis of capillaries and a large vessel are essential for oxygen supply, whereas a large vessel or capillary networks alone make negligible contributions to the supply. The hierarchical vascular networks are formed by a top&#8208;down approach, which offers a new option for ex vivo whole organs without decellularization and 3D&#8208;bioprinting.

The supply of oxygen and nutrition is extremely significant for such tissues. Therefore, a hierarchical vascular network containing capillaries and an artificial channel for perfusion are formed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of tissue-like structures such as cell sheets, spheroids, and organoids has contributed to progress in regenerative medicine. Simultaneous achievement of scale up and high cell density of these tissues is challenging because sufficient oxygen cannot be supplied to the inside of large, high cell density tissues. Here, in vitro fabrication of vessels to supply oxygen to the inside of millimeter-sized scaffold-free tissues whose cell density is &#8776;200 million cells mL&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, corresponding to those of native tissues, is shown. Hierarchical vascular networks by anastomosis of capillaries and a large vessel are essential for oxygen supply, whereas a large vessel or capillary networks alone make negligible contributions to the supply. The hierarchical vascular networks are formed by a top-down approach, which offers a new option for ex vivo whole organs without decellularization and 3D-bioprinting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Thermally Crosslinked Hole Conductor Enables Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with 23.9% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>

A simple small molecule 10&#8208;(4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;3,7&#8208;bis(4&#8208;vinylphenyl)&#8208;10H&#8208;phenoxazine is developed for in situ fabrication of polymer hole conductor (CL&#8208;MCz) via a facile and low&#8208;temperature cross&#8208;linking technology. The device with CL&#8208;MCz yields a champion power conversion efficiency of 23.9% along with an extremely low energy loss down to 0.41 eV.








Abstract
Poly[bis(4&#8208;phenyl)(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) represents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hole transport material (HTM) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, unsatisfied surface properties of PTAA and high energy disorder in the bulk film hinder the further enhancement of device performance. Herein, a simple small molecule 10&#8208;(4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;3,7&#8208;bis(4&#8208;vinylphenyl)&#8208;10H&#8208;phenoxazine (MCz&#8208;VPOZ) is strategically developed for in situ fabrication of polymer hole conductor (CL&#8208;MCz) via a facile and low&#8208;temperature cross&#8208;linking technology. The resulting polymer CL&#8208;MCz offers high energy ordering and improved electrical conductivity, as well as appropriate energy&#8208;level alignment, enabling efficient charge carrier collection in the devices. Meanwhile, CL&#8208;MCz synchronously provides satisfied surface wettability and interfacial functionalization, facilitating the formation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films with fewer bulk iodine vacancies and suppressed carrier recombination. Significantly, the device with CL&#8208;MCz yields a champion efficiency of 23.9% along with an extremely low energy loss down to 0.41 eV, which represents the highest reported efficiency for non&#8208;PTAA&#8208;based polymer HTMs in inverted PSCs. Furthermore, the corresponding unencapsulated devices exhibit competitive shelf&#8208;life stability under various operational stressors up to 2500 h, reflecting high promises of CL&#8208;MCz in the scalable PSC application. This work underscores the promising potential of the cross&#8208;linking approach in preparing low&#8208;cost, stable, and efficient polymer HTMs toward reliable PSCs.

         <title>A New Class of Cluster&#8211;Matrix Nanocomposite Made of Fully Miscible Components</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The prospect for creating highly metastable nanocomposite materials made from fully miscible alloy systems, like Ni&#8211;Cu, is opened. The cluster ion beam deposition technique allows stabilization of 2000&#8208;atom Ni&#8208;clusters in a Cu&#8208;matrix with varying macroscopic concentration. Consequently, unique magnetic and magnetotransport properties are evident as a function of cluster concentration and enthalpy&#8208;driven cluster dissolution.








Abstract
Nanocomposite materials, consisting of two or more phases, at least one of which has a nanoscale dimension, play a distinctive role in materials science because of the multiple possibilities for tailoring their structural properties and, consequently, their functionalities. In addition to the challenges of controlling the size, size distribution, and volume fraction of nanometer phases, thermodynamic stability conditions limit the choice of constituent materials. This study goes beyond this limitation by showing the possibility of achieving nanocomposites from a bimetallic system, which exhibits complete miscibility under equilibrium conditions. A series of nanocomposite samples with different compositions are synthesized by the co&#8208;deposition of 2000&#8208;atom Ni&#8208;clusters and a flux of Cu&#8208;atoms using a novel cluster ion beam deposition system. The retention of the metastable nanostructure is ascertained from atom probe tomography (APT), magnetometry, and magnetotransport studies. APT confirms the presence of nanoscale regions with &#8776;100 at% Ni. Magnetometry and magnetotransport studies reveal superparamagnetic behavior and magnetoresistance stemming from the single&#8208;domain ferromagnetic Ni&#8208;clusters embedded in the Cu&#8208;matrix. Essentially, the magnetic properties of the nanocomposites can be tailored by the precise control of the Ni concentration. The initial results offer a promising direction for future research on nanocomposites consisting of fully miscible elements.

         <title>Efficient Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells on Industrially Compatible Textured Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, an anion&#8208;engineered additive strategy is reported to modify the crystallization process of perovskite films on industrially feasible double&#8208;side textured silicon, which enables conformal deposition with improved film crystallinity and reduced trap density. This allows the fabrication of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with efficiencies of 28.9% (certified efficiency of 27.9%) and 25.1% for areas of 1 and 16&#160;cm2, respectively.








Abstract
Monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells promise power&#8208;conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding the Shockley&#8208;Queisser limit of single&#8208;junction solar cells. The conformal deposition of perovskites on industrially feasible textured silicon solar cells allows for both lowered manufacturing costs and a higher matched photocurrent density, compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art tandems using front&#8208;side flat or mildly textured silicon. However, the inferior crystal quality of perovskite films grown on fully&#8208;textured silicon compromises the photovoltaic performance. Here, an anion&#8208;engineered additive strategy is developed to control the crystallization process of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite films, which enables improved film crystallinity, reduced trap density, and conformal deposition on industrially textured silicon. This strategy allows the fabrication of 28.6%&#8208;efficient perovskite/silicon heterojunction tandem solar cells (certified 27.9%, 1&#160;cm2). This approach is compatible with the scalable fabrication of tandems on industrially textured silicon, demonstrating an efficiency of 25.1% for an aperture area of 16&#160;cm2. The anion&#8208;engineered additive significantly improves the operating stability of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells, and the encapsulated tandem solar cells retain over 80% of their initial performance following 2000&#160;h of operation under full 1&#8208;sun illumination in ambient conditions.

         <title>Observation of Multi&#8208;Directional Energy Transfer in a Hybrid Plasmonic&#8211;Excitonic Nanostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrafast charge and energy exchange across the interface of a hybrid plasmonic heterostructure are explored with momentum resolved electron spectroscopy and diffraction. The results identify a multi&#8208;directional energy exchange on timescales shorter than the electronic thermalization of the nanometal, driven by a non&#8208;linear plasmon&#8211;exciton interaction. Non&#8208;radiative exciton recombination, electron&#8211;phonon coupling, and diffusive charge&#8208;transfer determine the subsequent energy backflow.








Abstract
Hybrid plasmonic devices involve a nanostructured metal supporting localized surface plasmons to amplify light&#8211;matter interaction, and a non&#8208;plasmonic material to functionalize charge excitations. Application&#8208;relevant epitaxial heterostructures, however, give rise to ballistic ultrafast dynamics that challenge the conventional semiclassical understanding of unidirectional nanometal&#8208;to&#8208;substrate energy transfer. Epitaxial Au nanoislands are studied on WSe2 with time&#8208; and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy and femtosecond electron diffraction: this combination of techniques resolves material, energy, and momentum of charge&#8208;carriers and phonons excited in the heterostructure. A strong non&#8208;linear plasmon&#8211;exciton interaction that transfers the energy of sub&#8208;bandgap photons very efficiently to the semiconductor is observed, leaving the metal cold until non&#8208;radiative exciton recombination heats the nanoparticles on hundreds of femtoseconds timescales. The results resolve a multi&#8208;directional energy exchange on timescales shorter than the electronic thermalization of the nanometal. Electron&#8211;phonon coupling and diffusive charge&#8208;transfer determine the subsequent energy flow. This complex dynamics opens perspectives for optoelectronic and photocatalytic applications, while providing a constraining experimental testbed for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art&#160;modelling.

A strong non-linear plasmon&#8211;exciton interaction that transfers the energy of sub-bandgap photons very efficiently to the semiconductor is observed, leaving the metal cold until non-radiative exciton recombination heats the nanoparticles on hundreds of femtoseconds timescales. The results resolve a multi-directional energy exchange on timescales shorter than the electronic thermalization of the nanometal. Electron&#8211;phonon coupling and diffusive charge-transfer determine the subsequent energy flow. This complex dynamics opens perspectives for optoelectronic and photocatalytic applications, while providing a constraining experimental testbed for state-of-the-art&#160;modelling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multimorphic Materials: Spatially Tailoring Mechanical Properties via Selective Initiation of Interpenetrating Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two disparate polymer networks are created simultaneously using non&#8208;interacting chemical reactions and light as a stimulus. Upon turning the light on, the polymers want to phase&#8208;separate like oil and water, but the process is hindered as they interlock. Thus, the degree and location of phase separation, and in&#8208;turn mechanical properties, can be precisely controlled by the &#8220;flick of a switch&#8221;.








Abstract
Access to multimaterial polymers with spatially localized properties and robust interfaces is anticipated to enable new capabilities in soft robotics, such as smooth actuation for advanced medical and manufacturing technologies. Here, orthogonal initiation is used to create interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) with spatial control over morphology and mechanical properties. Base catalyzes the formation of a stiff and strong polyurethane, while blue LEDs initiate the formation of a soft and elastic polyacrylate. IPN morphology is controlled by when the LED is turned &#8220;on&#8221;, with large phase separation occurring for short time delays (&#8776;1&#8211;2 min) and a mixed morphology for longer time delays (&gt;5&#160;min), which is supported by dynamic mechanical analysis, small angle X&#8208;ray scattering, and atomic force microscopy. Through tailoring morphology, tensile moduli and fracture toughness can be tuned across &#8776;1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude. Moreover, a simple spring model is used to explain the observed mechanical behavior. Photopatterning produces &#8220;multimorphic&#8221; materials, where morphology is spatially localized with fine precision (&lt;100&#160;&#181;m), while maintaining a uniform chemical composition throughout to mitigate interfacial failure. As a final demonstration, the fabrication of hinges represents a possible use case for multimorphic materials in soft robotics.

         <title>Fast and Dynamic Mapping of the Protein Corona on Nanoparticle Surfaces by Photocatalytic Proximity Labeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein corona broadly affects the delivery of nanomedicines in vivo. Here, a photocatalytic proximity labeling technology in nanoparticles (nano&#8208;PPL) is developed for in situ labeling of corona proteins. Nano&#8208;PPL exhibits a significantly improved temporal resolution (5 s duration) and reveals precise dynamics of protein coronas on anionic and cationic nanoparticles. This technology represents a significant methodological advance toward nano&#8208;protein interactions.








Abstract
Protein corona broadly affects the delivery of nanomedicines in vivo. Although it has been widely studied by multiple strategies like centrifugal sedimentation, the rapidly forming mechanism and the dynamic structure of the protein corona at the seconds level remains challenging. Here, a photocatalytic proximity labeling technology in nanoparticles (nano&#8208;PPL) is developed. By fabricating a &#8220;core&#8208;shell&#8221; nanoparticle co&#8208;loaded with chlorin e6 catalyst and biotin&#8208;phenol probe, nano&#8208;PPL technology is validated for the rapid and precise labeling of corona proteins in situ. Nano&#8208;PPL significantly improves the temporal resolution of nano&#8208;protein interactions to 5 s duration compared with the classical centrifugation method (&gt;30 s duration). Furthermore, nano&#8208;PPL achieves the fast and dynamic mapping of the protein corona on anionic and cationic nanoparticles, respectively. Finally, nano&#8208;PPL is deployed to verify the effect of the rapidly formed protein corona on the initial interaction of nanoparticles with cells. These findings highlight a significant methodological advance toward nano&#8208;protein interactions in the delivery of nanomedicines in vivo.

         <title>Imaging Guided Endogenic H2&#8208;Augmented Electrochemo&#8208;Sonodynamic Domino Co&#8208;therapy of Tumor in Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective imaging&#8208;guided/&#8208;assessed H2&#8208;therapy of tumors based on a joint electrochemo&#8208;sonodynamic treatment (H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy) is developed. The endogenic H2&#8208;triggered &#8220;domino effect&#8221; in tumor tissue is clearly revealed. The developed H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy guided by US imaging in vivo will open up a feasible new way for green, economic, and effective treatment of cancer in the future.








Abstract
Precise and on&#8208;demand release of sufficient hydrogen (H2) to tumor sites remains a key challenge for emerging H2&#8208;oncotherapy, and little is known about the physiological effects of &#8220;abundant&#8221; H2 on complex tumor microenvironments (TME). Here, a highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective imaging&#8208;guided/&#8208;assessed H2&#8208;therapy of tumors based on a joint electrochemo&#8208;sonodynamic treatment (H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy) with strong &#8220;domino effect&#8221; triggered by endogenous H2 generation at tumor sites is reported to speedily eliminate tumor tissue (&#8804;80&#160;mm3) within 1&#160;day. Adequate H2 is controllably generated in tumor sites through mild electrochemistry in vivo due to acidic TME by using clinical acupuncture Fe needles as electrodes. Besides starvation damage due to gas blockage/destruction of vessels, nano&#8208;/micro&#8208;bubbles of H2 formed in situ can elevate the tumor's internal temperature and burst vessels to further destroy the tumor&#160;under ultrasound irradiation. Remarkably, vulnerable homeostasis of TME is disturbed as H2 also participates in the physiological activity of tumor cells, leading to tumor dysfunction. Last but not least, the body's inflammatory response to cancer is reduced after the treatment, which is beneficial for the body's immune system during post&#8208;treatment recovery. Based on all of these merits, the H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy provides a potentially safe and viable therapeutic strategy for future clinical applications.

         <title>Formation Mechanism and Bandgap Reduction of GaN&#8211;ZnO Solid&#8208;Solution Thin Films Fabricated by Nanolamination of Atomic Layer Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanolamination of GaN and ZnO layers by atomic layer deposition is employed to fabricate (GaN)1&#8722;x(ZnO)x homogenous solid&#8208;solution films with 0.39 &#8806; x &#8806; 0.79 by varying the cycle ratios. The density functional theory calculations using a superlattice model are performed to evaluate and validate the reduction of bandgaps that results in enhanced visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.








Abstract
Nanolamination of GaN and ZnO layers by atomic layer deposition (ALD) is employed to fabricate GaN&#8211;ZnO homogenous solid&#8208;solution thin films because it offers more precise control of the stoichiometry. By varying the ALD cycle ratios of GaN:ZnO from 5:10 to 10:5, the (GaN)1&#8722;x(ZnO)x films with 0.39 &#8806; x &#8806; 0.79 are obtained. The formation of solid solution is explained based on the atomic stacking and preferred orientation of the layers of GaN and ZnO. However, the growth rates of GaN and ZnO during the lamination process are different from those of pure GaN and ZnO films. It is found that GaN grows faster on ZnO, whereas ZnO grows slower on GaN. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed using a superlattice model for GaN and ZnO laminated layers fabricated by ALD to understand the difference of density of states (DOS) and evaluate the bandgaps for various atomic configurations in the solid&#8208;solution films. The band positions are experimentally defined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. Significant bandgap reduction of the solid solutions is observed, which can be explained by the DOS from the DFT calculations. Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is conducted to confirm the applicability of the solid&#8208;solution films.

The band positions are experimentally defined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. Significant bandgap reduction of the solid solutions is observed, which can be explained by the DOS from the DFT calculations. Visible-light-driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is conducted to confirm the applicability of the solid-solution films.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fullerene&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Crystal&#8208;Induced Micrometer&#8208;Scale Charge&#8208;Carrier Diffusion in Organic Bulk Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;mobility fullerene liquid crystal is introduced into the active layer of organic solar cells (OSCs) to provide a fast channel for charge&#8208;carrier transport, reduce energetic disorder and trap density via enhancing crystallization, and then realize micrometer&#8208;scale charge&#8208;carrier diffusion, leading to the impressive power conversion efficiencies of 15.23% for OSCs with the thickness approaching 500 nm.








Abstract
The short charge&#8208;carrier diffusion length (LD) (100&#8211;300&#160;nm) in organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) impedes the further improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs), especially for thick&#8208;film (&gt;400&#160;nm) devices matching with industrial solution processing. Here a facile method is developed to efficiently increase LD and then improve PCEs of OSCs via introducing a fullerene liquid crystal, F1, into the active layer. F1 combines the inherent high electron mobility of fullerene and strong self&#8208;assembly capacity of liquid crystal, providing a fast channel for charge&#8208;carrier transport&#160;and reducing energetic disorder and trap density in BHJ film via enhancing crystallization. Typically, in PM6:Y6:F1 BHJ, the enhanced charge&#8208;carrier mobility (&gt;10&#8722;2 cm&#8722;2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and prolonged charge&#8208;carrier lifetime (55.3 &#181;s) are acquired to realize the record LD of 1.6 or 2.4&#160;&#181;m for electron or hole, respectively, which are much higher than those of the PM6:Y6 binary sample and comparable to or even better than those values reported for some inorganic/hybrid materials, such as CuInxGa(1&#8722;x)Se2 (CIGS) and perovskite thin films. Benefitting from the micrometer&#8208;scale LD, the PM6:Y6:F1 ternary OSCs sustain a remarkable PCE of 15.23% with the active layer thickness approaching 500&#160;nm.

         <title>Electron Conductive and Transparent Hydrogels for Recording Brain Neural Signals and Neuromodulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is proposed to break the current bottleneck of implantable materials, which demonstrate a suit of desirable performances including matched modulus, good transparency, and high conductivity. The hydrogel electrode is successfully utilized for optogenetic neuromodulation and simultaneously recording the brain's neural signals, establishing the correlation between brain neural signals and corresponding limb behavior.








Abstract
Recording brain neural signals and optogenetic neuromodulations open&#160;frontiers in decoding brain neural information and neurodegenerative disease therapeutics. Conventional implantable probes suffer from modulus mismatch with biological tissues and an irreconcilable tradeoff between transparency and electron conductivity. Herein, a strategy is proposed to address these tradeoffs, which generates conductive and transparent hydrogels with polypyrrole&#8208;decorated microgels as cross&#8208;linkers. The optical transparency of the electrodes can be attributed to the special structures that allow light waves to bypass the microgel particles and minimize their interaction. Demonstrated by probing the hippocampus of rat brains, the biomimetic electrode shows a prolonged capacity for simultaneous optogenetic neuromodulation and recording of brain neural signals. More importantly, an intriguing brain&#8211;machine interaction is realized, which involves signal input to the brain, brain neural signal generation, and controlling limb behaviors. This breakthrough work represents a significant scientific advancement toward decoding brain neural information and developing neurodegenerative disease therapies.

         <title>Strain Engineering of Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode Enables Exceptional Cyclability in Pouch&#8208;Type Full Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a super&#8208;dispersed Nb&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;rich cathode, which consists of the elongated and radially aligned primary particles with rich oxygen stable {001} planes. The resultant cathode effectively homogenizes the intragranular and intergranular strain and greatly inhibits the Li/Ni disordering and lattice oxygen loss during de&#8208;/lilthiation, leading to superior electrochemical performances at various rates and operating temperatures.








Abstract
Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are at the forefront of the development of high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion batteries, yet the extensive applications are retarded by the deteriorative capacity and thermal instability. Herein, an in situ co&#8208;precipitation strategy is implemented to achieve the novel super&#8208;dispersed Nb&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;rich cathode that consists of the elongated and radially aligned primary particles with increased oxygen stable {001} planes. The unique microstructure homogenizes the intragranular and intergranular strain distribution and stabilizes the spherical secondary particles, effectively inhibiting microcrack formation and propagation and surface degradation. The super&#8208;dispersed Nb doping prevents the Li/Ni disordering and lattice oxygen escape, thereby further strengthening the crystal structure and thermal stability. Accordingly, this cathode delivers a high reversible capacity of 229.0 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C with much better retention at 55 &#176;C and 5 C after 100 cycles than the conventional Nb&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;rich cathodes. In a pouch&#8208;type full cell, it exhibits exceptionally long life with a capacity retention of 91.9% at 1 C after 500 cycles and 80.5% at 5 C after 2000 cycles within 3.0&#8211;4.2&#160;V, greatly prolonging the service period to cater to the lightweight and intelligence of electric vehicles.

         <title>Transparent Porous Conductive Substrates for Gas&#8208;Phase Photoelectrochemical Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transparent gas diffusion electrodes are developed via the F&#8208;doped SnO2 coating of SiO2 fused fiber felts. These highly porous and conductive substrates are amenable to the disposition of various semiconductors and are employed herein to demonstrate photoelectrode membrane assemblies for solar&#8208;driven H2 production in a gas&#8208;phase flow cell.








Abstract
Gas diffusion electrodes are essential components of common fuel and electrolysis cells but are typically made from graphitic carbon or metallic materials, which do not allow light transmittance and thus limit the development of gas&#8208;phase based photoelectrochemical devices. Herein, the simple and scalable preparation of F&#8208;doped SnO2 (FTO) coated SiO2 interconnected fiber felt substrates is reported. Using 2&#8211;5&#160;&#181;m diameter fibers at a loading of 4&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, the resulting substrates have porosity of 90%, roughness factor of 15.8, and Young's Modulus of 0.2&#160;GPa. A 100 nm conformal coating of FTO via atmospheric chemical vapor deposition gives sheet resistivity of 20 &#177; 3 &#937; sq&#8722;1 and loss of incident light of 41% at illumination wavelength of 550&#160;nm. The coating of various semiconductors on the substrates is established including Fe2O3 (chemical bath deposition), CuSCN and Cu2O (electrodeposition), and conjugated polymers (dip coating), and liquid&#8208;phase photoelectrochemical performance commensurate with flat FTO substrates is confirmed. Finally, gas phase H2 production is demonstrated with a polymer semiconductor photocathode membrane assembly at 1&#8208;Sun photocurrent density on the order of 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and Faradaic efficiency of 40%.

         <title>Dual Topology of Dirac Electron Transport and Photogalvanic Effect in Low&#8208;Dimensional Topological Insulator Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stacking layer number&#8208;dependent electron structure, quantum properties, and circularly (linearly) polarized photogalvanic effect are assessed in the low&#8208;dimensional dual topological superlattices (TSLs) (Bi2Se3)&#8208;(Bi2/Bi2Se3)N. The results show that the surface electronic structure of the dual TSLs is highly tunable and well&#8208;regulated for quantum transport and photoexcitation, which shed light on engineering for opto&#8208;electronic/spintronic applications.








Abstract
Dual topological insulators, simultaneously protected by time&#8208;reversal symmetry and crystalline symmetry, open great opportunities to explore different symmetry&#8208;protected metallic surface states. However, the conventional dual topological states located on different facets hinder integration into planar opto&#8208;electronic/spintronic devices. Here, dual topological superlattices (TSLs) Bi2Se3&#8208;(Bi2/Bi2Se3)N with limited stacking layer number N are constructed. Angle&#8208;resolved photoelectron emission spectra of the TSLs identify the coexistence and adjustment of dual topological surface states on Bi2Se3 facet. The existence and tunability of spin&#8208;polarized dual&#8208;topological bands with N on Bi2Se3 facet result in an unconventionally weak antilocalization effect (WAL) with variable WAL coefficient &#945; (maximum close to 3/2) from quantum transport experiments. Most importantly, it is identified that the spin&#8208;polarized surface electrons from dual topological bands exhibit circularly and linearly polarized photogalvanic effect (CPGE and LPGE). It is anticipated that the stacked dual&#8208;topology and stacking layer number controlled bands evolution provide a platform for realizing intrinsic CPGE and LPGE. The results show that the surface electronic structure of the dual TSLs is highly tunable and well&#8208;regulated for quantum transport and photoexcitation, which shed light on engineering for opto&#8208;electronic/spintronic applications.

         <title>Ferroelectric Domain Control of Nonlinear Light Polarization in MoS2 via PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 Thin Films and Free&#8208;Standing Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferroelectric domain patterning enabled approach is developed to achieve nanoscale reconfigurable modulation of the amplitude and polarization of SHG light in MoS2 interfaced with PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 thin films and membranes. The light polarization exhibits threefold symmetry at polar domains and twofold symmetry at domain walls. This study opens up new opportunities for developing smart nano&#8208;photonics and optical computing systems.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) such as MoS2 exhibit exceptionally strong nonlinear optical responses, while nanoscale control of the amplitude, polar orientation, and phase of the nonlinear light in TMDCs remains challenging. In this work, by interfacing monolayer MoS2 with epitaxial PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (PZT) thin films and free&#8208;standing PZT membranes, the amplitude and polarization of the second harmonic generation (SHG) signal are modulated via ferroelectric domain patterning, which demonstrates that PZT membranes can lead to in&#8208;operando programming of nonlinear light polarization. The interfacial coupling of the MoS2 polar axis with either the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polar domains of PZT or the in&#8208;plane polarization of domain walls tailors the SHG light polarization into different patterns with distinct symmetries, which are modeled via nonlinear electromagnetic theory. This study provides a new material platform that enables reconfigurable design of light polarization at the nanoscale, paving the path for developing novel optical information processing, smart light modulators, and integrated photonic circuits.

         <title>Fast and Durable Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction at the Electron&#8208;Deficient Ruthenium&#8211;Ruthenium Oxide Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ru/RuO2 in&#8208;plane heterostructure is designed as an efficient electrocatalyst toward the alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). The interfacial Ru and RuO2 domains are the optimal H and OH adsorption sites, respectively. The Ru domains are electron deficient and show substantially improved inoxidizability. The results highlight the significance of establishing robust and multifunctional heterointerfaces toward fast alkaline HOR and beyond.








Abstract
The slow hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics under alkaline conditions remain a critical challenge for the practical application of alkaline exchange membrane fuel cells. Herein, Ru/RuO2 in&#8208;plane heterostructures are designed with abundant active Ru&#8211;RuO2 interface domains as efficient electrocatalysts for the HOR in alkaline media. The experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that interfacial Ru and RuO2 domains at Ru&#8211;RuO2 interfaces are the optimal H and OH adsorption sites, respectively, endowing the well&#8208;defined Ru(100)/RuO2(200) interface as the preferential region for fast alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis. More importantly, the metallic Ru domains become electron deficient due to the strong interaction with RuO2 domains and show substantially improved inoxidizability, which is vital to maintain durable HOR electrocatalytic activity. The optimal Ru/RuO2 heterostructured electrocatalyst exhibits impressive alkaline HOR activity with an exchange current density of 8.86&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and decent durability. The exceptional electrocatalytic performance of Ru/RuO2 in&#8208;plane heterostructure can be attributed to the robust and multifunctional Ru&#8211;RuO2 interfaces endowed by the unique metal&#8211;metal oxide domains.

         <title>Weakening Li+ De&#8208;solvation Barrier for Cryogenic Li&#8211;S Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antecedent theoretical simulations decipher the correlation between lithium salt concentration and Li+ desolvation barrier in the electrolyte, indicating dilute electrolytes can enhance kinetics of sulfur cathode effectively. This insight endows Li&#8211;S pouch cells with an ultra&#8208;high energy density of 350 Wh kg&#8208;1 at 0 &#176;C, demonstrating great&#160;potential for&#160;cryogenic&#160;Li&#8211;S&#160;batteries.








Abstract
Li&#8211;S batteries hold promise for pushing cell&#8208;level energy densities beyond 300&#160;Wh kg&#8208;1 while operating at low temperatures (LTs, below 0&#160;&#176;C). However, the capacity release of existing Li&#8211;S batteries at LTs is still barely satisfactory, and there is almost no verification of the practicability of Li&#8211;S batteries at LTs in the Ah&#8208;level pouch cell. Here, antecedent molecular dynamics (MDs) combined with density functional theory analysis are used to systematically investigate Li+ solvation structure in conventional Li&#8211;S batteries at LTs, which unprecedentedly reveals the positive correlation between lithium salt concentration and Li+ de&#8208;solvation barrier, indicating dilute electrolytes can enhance the Li+ de&#8208;solvation kinetics and thus improve the capacity performance of cryogenic Li&#8211;S batteries. These insights derived from theoretical simulations invested Li&#8211;S batteries with a 67.34% capacity retention at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C compared to their room temperature performance. In particular, an Ah&#8208;level Li&#8211;S pouch cell using dilute electrolytes with a high sulfur loading (5.6&#160;mg cm&#8208;2) and lean electrolyte condition is fabricated, which delivers a discharge capacity of about 1000 mAh g&#8208;1 and ultra&#8208;high energy density of 350&#160;Wh kg&#8208;1 at 0&#160;&#176;C, offering a promising route toward a practical high&#8208;energy cryogenic Li&#8211;S battery.

         <title>3D Cold&#8208;Trap Environment Printing for Long&#8208;Cycle Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative 3D cold trap environment printing technology (3DCEP) is proposed in this work to fabricate a MXene/Zn&#8208;P aerogel anode with highly aligned arrangement. Benefitting from unique high lattice matching and physical confinement effects inside the electrode, it can effectively inhibit the Zn dendrite growth and Zn&#8208;P corrosion in electrolytes. Finally, a 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P//MXene/Co&#8208;MnHCF full cell with long cyclic life can be realized.








Abstract
Zn powder (Zn&#8208;P)&#8208;based anodes are always regarded as ideal anode candidates for zinc ion batteries owing to their low cost and ease of processing. However, the intrinsic negative properties of Zn&#8208;P&#8208;based anodes such as easy corrosion and uncontrolled dendrite growth have limited their further applications. Herein, a novel 3D cold&#8208;trap environment printing (3DCEP) technology is proposed to achieve the MXene and Zn&#8208;P (3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P) anode with highly ordered arrangement. Benefitting from the unique inhibition mechanism of high lattice matching and physical confinement effects within the&#160;3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P anode, it can effectively homogenize the Zn2+ flux and alleviate the Zn deposition rate of the 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P anode during Zn plating&#8211;stripping. Consequently, the 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P anode exhibits a superior cycling lifespan of 1400&#160;h with high coulombic efficiency of &#8776;9.2% in symmetric batteries. More encouragingly, paired with MXene and Co doped MnHCF cathode via 3D cold&#8208;trap environment printing (3 DCEP&#8208;MXene/Co&#8208;MnHCF), the 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P//3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Co&#8208;MnHCF full battery delivers high cyclic durability with the capacity retention of 95.7% after 1600 cycles. This study brings an inspired universal pathway to rapidly fabricate a reversible Zn anode with highly ordered arrangement in a cold environment for micro&#8208;zinc storage systems.

         <title>Many&#8208;Body Correlations and Exciton Complexes in CsPbBr3 Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many&#8208;body interactions in exciton complexes are crucial in many devices, for example, lasers, LEDs, and quantum light sources. Here, a combination of single quantum&#8208;dot photoluminescence spectroscopy at cryogenic temperatures and configuration&#8208;interaction calculations reveals the size&#8208;dependent binding energies of trions (7&#8211;17&#160;meV) and biexcitons (15&#8211;30&#160;meV) in CsPbBr3&#160;quantum dots.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic lead&#8208;halide perovskite (LHP) (CsPbX3, X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br, I) quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as a competitive platform for classical light&#8208;emitting devices (in the weak light&#8211;matter interaction regime, e.g., LEDs and laser), as well as for devices exploiting strong light&#8211;matter interaction at room temperature. Many&#8208;body interactions and quantum correlations among photogenerated exciton complexes play an essential role, for example, by determining the laser threshold, the overall brightness of LEDs, and the single&#8208;photon purity in quantum light sources. Here, by combining cryogenic single&#8208;QD photoluminescence spectroscopy with configuration&#8208;interaction (CI) calculations, the size&#8208;dependent trion and biexciton binding energies are addressed. Trion binding energies increase from 7&#160;to 17&#160;meV for QD sizes decreasing from 30&#160;to 9&#160;nm, while the biexciton binding energies increase from 15&#160;to 30&#160;meV, respectively. CI calculations quantitatively corroborate the experimental results and suggest that the effective dielectric constant for biexcitons slightly deviates from the one of the single excitons, potentially as a result of coupling to the lattice in the multiexciton regime. The findings here provide a deep insight into the multiexciton properties in all&#8208;inorganic LHP QDs, essential for classical and quantum optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Engineering the Electronic Structure of Single&#8208;Atom Iron Sites with Boosted Oxygen Bifunctional Activity for Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to create a single&#8208;atom Fe catalyst on a mesoporous NC material by engineering the electronic structures of the metal sites is reported. This catalyst achieves remarkable electrocatalytic activity in the oxygen reduction reaction&#160;and oxygen evolution reaction, and demonstrates great potential in zinc&#8211;air batteries. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the optimized electronic structure of Fe1N4O1 moieties contributes to excellent electrocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries typically require efficient, durable, and inexpensive bifunctional electrocatalysts to support oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER). However, sluggish kinetics and mass transportation challenges must be addressed if the performance of these catalysts is to be enhanced. Herein, a strategy to fabricate a catalyst comprising atomically dispersed iron atoms supported on a mesoporous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support (Fe SAs/NC) with accessible metal sites and optimized electronic metal&#8211;support interactions is developed. Both the experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the engineered electronic structures of the metal active sites can regulate the charge distribution of Fe centers to optimize the adsorption/desorption of oxygenated intermediates. The Fe SAs/NC containing Fe1N4O1 sites achieves remarkable ORR activity over the entire pH range, with half&#8208;wave potentials of 0.93, 0.83, and 0.75&#160;V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) in alkaline, acidic, and neutral electrolytes, respectively. In addition, it demonstrates a promising low overpotential of 320&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for OER in alkaline conditions. The zinc&#8211;air battery assembled with Fe SAs/NC exhibits superior performance than that of Pt/C+RuO2 counterpart in terms of peak power density, specific capacity, and cycling stability. These findings demonstrate the importance of the electronic structure engineering of metal sites in directing catalytic activity.

         <title>Initiating Reversible Aqueous Copper&#8211;Tellurium Conversion Reaction with High Volumetric Capacity through Electrolyte Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The copper&#8211;tellurium conversion reaction with high volumetric capacity of 3927&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;3 and long discharge plateau are investigated. The thermodynamic&#8211;kinetic asymmetries of the Cu&#8211;Te multiphase&#8208;conversion and oxidation&#8208;failure mechanisms are systematically revealed. The developed precise electrolyte engineering overcomes inherent oxidative distress and extends the cycling life of the battery by about three orders of magnitude.








Abstract
Pursuing conversion&#8208;type cathodes with high volumetric capacity that can be used in aqueous environments remains rewarding and challenging. Tellurium (Te) is a promising alternative electrode due to its intrinsic attractive electronic conductivity and high theoretical volumetric capacity yet still to be explored. Herein, the kinetically/thermodynamically co&#8208;dominat copper&#8211;tellurium (Cu&#8211;Te) alloying phase&#8208;conversion process and corresponding oxidation failure mechanism of tellurium are investigated using in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and comprehensive ex situ characterization techniques. By virtue of the fundamental insights into the tellurium electrode, facile and precise electrolyte engineering (solvated structure modulation or reductive antioxidant addition) is implemented to essentially tackle the dramatic capacity loss in tellurium, affording reversible aqueous Cu&#8211;Te conversion reaction with an unprecedented ultrahigh volumetric capacity of up to 3927&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;3, a flat long discharge plateau (capacity proportion of &#8776;81%), and an extraordinary level of capacity retention of 80.4% over 2000 cycles at 20&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 of which lifespan thousand&#8208;fold longer than Cu&#8211;Te conversion using CuSO4&#8211;H2O electrolyte. This work paves a significant avenue for expanding high&#8208;performance conversion&#8208;type cathodes toward energetic aqueous multivalent&#8208;ion batteries.

By virtue of the fundamental insights into the tellurium electrode, facile and precise electrolyte engineering (solvated structure modulation or reductive antioxidant addition) is implemented to essentially tackle the dramatic capacity loss in tellurium, affording reversible aqueous Cu&#8211;Te conversion reaction with an unprecedented ultrahigh volumetric capacity of up to 3927&#160;mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, a flat long discharge plateau (capacity proportion of &#8776;81%), and an extraordinary level of capacity retention of 80.4% over 2000 cycles at 20&#160;A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; of which lifespan thousand-fold longer than Cu&#8211;Te conversion using CuSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O electrolyte. This work paves a significant avenue for expanding high-performance conversion-type cathodes toward energetic aqueous multivalent-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optically Excited Lasing in a Cavity&#8208;Based, High&#8208;Current&#8208;Density Quantum Dot Electroluminescent Device</title>

         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;function colloidal quantum dot (QD) devices that operate as a high&#8208;current density light emitting diode and an optically excited laser are demonstrated. The device structure has been optimized to reduce optical losses and allow for efficient wave&#8208;guiding within the active QD layer. This demonstration represents an important milestone toward the practical implementation of a colloidal QD laser diode.








Abstract
Laser diodes based on solution&#8208;processable materials can benefit numerous technologies including integrated electronics and photonics, telecommunications, and medical diagnostics. An attractive system for implementing these devices is colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). The progress towards a QD laser diode has been hampered by rapid nonradiative Auger decay of optical&#8208;gain&#8208;active multicarrier states, fast device degradation at high current densities required for laser action, and unfavorable competition between optical gain and optical losses in a multicomponent device stack. Here&#160;we&#160;resolve some of these challenges and demonstrate optically excited lasing from fully functional high&#8208;current density electroluminescent (EL) devices with an integrated optical resonator. This advance has become possible due to excellent optical gain properties of continuously graded QDs and a refined device architecture, which allows for highly efficient light amplification in a thin, EL&#8208;active QD layer.

         <title>Macroscale Fabrication of Lightweight and Strong Porous Carbon Foams through Template&#8208;Coating Pair Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The manufacturing of low&#8208;density&#8208;high&#8208;strength carbon materials on a macroscopic length scale has a significant impact on the construction, packaging, and transportation industries. Presented herein is a tunable platform for macroscale fabrication of lightweight and strong pyrolytic carbon foams through template&#8208;coating pair design.








Abstract
Manufacturing of low&#8208;density&#8208;high&#8208;strength carbon foams can benefit the construction, transportation, and packaging industries. One successful route to lightweight and mechanically strong carbon foams involves pyrolysis of polymeric architectures, which is inevitably accompanied by drastic volumetric shrinkage (usually &gt;98%). As such, a challenge of these materials lies in maintaining bulk dimensions of building struts that span orders of magnitude difference in length scale from centimeters to nanometers. This work demonstrates fabrication of macroscale low&#8208;density&#8208;high&#8208;strength carbon foams that feature exceptional dimensional stability through pyrolysis of robust template&#8208;coating pairs. The template serves as the architectural blueprint and contains strength&#8208;imparting properties (e.g., high node density and small strut dimensions); it is composed of a low char&#8208;yielding porous polystyrene backbone with a high carbonization&#8208;onset temperature. The coating serves to imprint and transcribe the template architecture into pyrolytic carbon; it is composed of a high char&#8208;yielding conjugated polymer with a relatively low carbonization&#8208;onset temperature. The designed carbonization mismatch enables structural inheritance, while the decomposition mismatch affords hollow struts, minimizing density. The carbons synthesized through this new framework exhibit remarkable dimensional stability (&#8776;80% dimension retention; &#8776;50% volume retention) and some of the highest specific strengths (&#8776;0.13&#160;GPa g&#8722;1 cm3) among reported carbon foams derived from porous polymer templates.

         <title>Well&#8208;Defined Fullerene Bisadducts Enable High&#8208;Performance Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure&#8208;dependent effects of the four fullerene bisadduct regioisomers on the device performance of tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells are systemically investigated. Benefiting from the favorable molecular packing, energy level alignment, and interfacial interaction, the trans&#8208;3&#8208;based devices yield a champion efficiency of 14.58% with a certified efficiency of 14.30%, representing one of the best&#8208;performing tin&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) are attracting intense research interest due to their excellent optoelectric properties and eco&#8208;friendly features. To further improve the device performance, developing new fullerene derivatives as electron transporter layers (ETLs) is highly demanded. Four well&#8208;defined regioisomers (trans&#8208;2, trans&#8208;3, trans&#8208;4, and e) of diethylmalonate&#8208;C60 bisadduct (DCBA) are isolated and well characterized. The well&#8208;defined molecular structure enables us to investigate the real structure&#8208;dependent effects on photovoltaic performance. It is found that the chemical structures of the regioisomers not only affect their energy levels, but also lead to significant differences in their molecular packings and interfacial contacts. As a result, the devices with trans&#8208;2, trans&#8208;3, trans&#8208;4, and e as ETLs yield efficiencies of 11.69%, 14.58%, 12.59%, and 10.55%, respectively, which are higher than that of the as&#8208;prepared DCBA&#8208;based (10.28%) device. Notably, the trans&#8208;3&#8208;based device also demonstrates a certified efficiency of 14.30%, representing one of the best&#8208;performing TPSCs.

         <title>Control of Molecular Orbital Ordering Using a van der Waals Monolayer Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling and tuning the orbital ordering in a single molecule using a monolayer ferroelectric substrate is realized. This is achieved by adsorbing transition metal phthalocyanine (TMPc) molecules on a ferroelectric monolayer SnTe. The orbital order is probed using low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments, and it is demonstrated that it can be controllably changed by switching the polarization direction of the underlying ferroelectric monolayer.








Abstract
2D ferroelectric materials provide a promising platform for the electrical control of quantum states. In particular, due to their 2D nature, they are suitable for influencing the quantum states of deposited molecules via the proximity effect. Here, electrically controllable molecular states in phthalocyanine molecules adsorbed on monolayer ferroelectric material SnTe are reported. The strain and ferroelectric order in SnTe are found to create a transition between two distinct orbital orders in the adsorbed phthalocyanine molecules. By controlling the polarization of the ferroelectric domain using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), it is successfully demonstrated that orbital order can be manipulated electrically. The results show how ferroelastic coupling in 2D systems allows for control of molecular states, providing a starting point for ferroelectrically switchable molecular orbital ordering and ultimately, electrical control of molecular&#160;magnetism.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme with Asymmetric Electron Distribution for Tumor Catalytic Therapy by Disrupting Tumor Redox and Energy Metabolism Homeostasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the drawbacks of current nanozyme catalytic therapy, a novel Ir&#63743;N5 single&#8208;atom/Cer nanoagent with asymmetric electron distribution is developed, which can improve the efficiency of multienzyme&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions through a substrate&#8208;recyclable manner, thereby disrupting the intracellular redox and energy metabolism homeostasis to achieve efficient tumor therapy.








Abstract
Nanozyme catalytic therapy triggered by tumor&#8208;specific endogenous stimuli is an emerging tumor therapy that attracts wide attention. However, the current therapeutic efficacy of nanozyme catalytic therapy is severely limited by the catalytic efficiency of nanozymes and the concentration of endogenous reaction substrates. Herein, a novel and efficient Ir&#63743;N5 single&#8208;atom (Ir&#63743;N5 SA) nanozyme is developed with multiple enzyme&#8208;like catalytic activities. Due to the synergistic effect of central Ir single&#8208;atom and axial N coordination, Ir&#63743;N5 SA exhibits better enzymatic catalytic performance than Ir&#63743;N4 SA. At tumor sites, Ir&#63743;N5 SA can generate a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through oxidase (OXD)&#8208;like and peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like catalytic activities. Moreover, Ir&#63743;N5 SA can also generate O2 and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through catalase (CAT)&#8208;like and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) oxidase (NOX)&#8208;like catalytic activities, realizing the efficient nanozyme catalytic therapy in a substrate&#8208;cycle manner. Additionally, Ir&#63743;N5 SA can effectively break the intracellular NADH/NAD+ cycle balance by mimicking NOX, and then cooperate with fatty acid synthase cerulenin (Cer) to interfere with the energy metabolism homeostasis of tumor cells. Consequently, the designed Ir&#63743;N5 SA/Cer nanoagent can disrupt redox and metabolic homeostasis in the tumor region through an enzyme&#8208;mimicking cascade reaction, effectively overcoming the shortcomings of current nanozyme catalytic therapy.

         <title>Monolithic Tandem Vertical Electrochemical Transistors for Printed Multi&#8208;Valued Logic</title>

A new design of high&#8208;speed electrochemical ternary logic transistor is presented. A vertically stacked dual channel heterostructure enables a clear manifestation of multiple logic states in 1&#160;V input&#8211;output voltage ranges, through a simple chemical&#8208;tuning of semiconductor materials.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have recently emerged as a feasible candidate to realize the next generation of printable electronics. Especially, their chemical versatility and the unique redox&#8208;based operating principle have provided new possibilities in high&#8208;functioning logic circuitry beyond the traditional binary Boolean logic. Here, a simple strategy to electrochemically realize monolithic multi&#8208;valued logic transistors is presented, which is one of the most promising branches of transistor technology in the forthcoming era of hyper Moore's law. A vertically stacked heterogeneous dual&#8208;channel architecture is introduced with a patterned reference electrode, which enables a facile manifestation of stable and equiprobable ternary logic states with a reduced transistor footprint. The dual&#8208;ion&#8208;penetration mechanism coupled with ultrashort vertical channel even allows a very&#8208;high accessing frequency to multiple logic states reaching over 10&#160;MHz. Furthermore, printed arrays of ternary logic gates with full voltage swing within 1&#160;V are demonstrated.

         <title>Metal Anodes with Ultrahigh Reversibility Enabled by the Closest Packing Crystallography for Sustainable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal strategy is reported to construct dendrite&#8208;free metal anodes with multiple crystal structures (hexagonal close&#8208;packed, face&#8208;centered cubic, and body&#8208;centered cubic) on single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) substrates, which epitaxially match the closest packed facets of metals. The closest packed facets of metal anodes aligned horizontally with substrates, resulting in compact planar construction and excellent chemical stability. Consequently, the metal anodes display high reversibility and outstanding performance.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;growing annual electricity generated from sustainable and intermittent energy such as wind and solar power requires cost effective and reliable electrochemical energy storage. Rechargeable batteries based on multivalent metal anodes such as Zn, Al, and Fe, taking advantage of large&#8208;scale production and affordable cost, have emerged as promising candidates. However, the uncontrollable dendrite&#8208;like metal deposition on regular substrate caused by disordered metal crystallization usually leads to premature failure of batteries and even safety concerns when the dendrite bridges the electrodes. Here it is reported that a series of metal anodes (Zn, Co, Al, Ni, and Fe) with multiple crystal structures (hexagonal close&#8208;packed, face&#8208;centered cubic, and body&#8208;centered cubic) can achieve dendrite&#8208;free and epitaxial deposition on single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) substrates enabled by the closest packing crystallography. Moreover, the closest packed facets are aligned horizontally with the substrates, resulting in compact planar construction and excellent chemical stability even at an unprecedented current density of 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2. The full cells under a practical anode&#8208;to&#8208;cathode capacity ratio of 2.3 show a cycling life span of over 800 cycles with Coulombic efficiency of &gt;&#160;99.9%. The universal approach of regulating metal electrodeposition in this work is expected to boost the development of emerging sustainable energy storage/conversion devices.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Cation Composition Engineering of Hybrid Cs1&#8722;xFAxPbBr3 Nanocrystals for Self&#8208;Healing Electronics Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel post&#8208;synthesis cesium/formamidinium (Cs/FA) mixed&#8208;cation perovskite nanocrystals possess high structural and optoelectronic properties for integration in self&#8208;healing polymer composites. Entropic&#8208;driven self&#8208;healing not only enhances white backlight display performance, but also sustains the working performance of a shattered&#8211;repaired glass substrate laser, thereby representing potentially major advances in optoelectronics and photonics applications.








Abstract
Mixed&#8208;cation hybrid perovskite nanocrystal (HPNC) with high crystallinity, color purity, and tunable optical bandgap offers a practical pathway toward next&#8208;generation&#160;displays. Herein, a two&#8208;step modified hot&#8208;injection combined with cation compositional engineering and surface treatment to synthesize high&#8208;purity cesium/formamidinium lead bromide HPNCs(Cs1&#8208;xFAxPbBr3) is presented. The optimized Cs0.5FA0.5PbBr3 light&#8208;emitting devices (LEDs) exhibit uniform luminescence of 3500&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and a prominent current efficiency of 21.5&#160;cd A&#8722;1. As a proof of concept, a self&#8208;healing polymer (SHP) integrated with white LED backlight and laser prototypes exhibited 4 h autonomous self&#8208;healing through the synergistic effect of weak reversible imine bonds and stronger H&#8208;bonds. First, the SHP&#8208;HPNCs&#8208;initial and SHP&#8208;HPNCs&#8208;cut possess high long&#8208;term stability and dramatically suppressed lead leakage as low as 0.6&#160;ppm along with a low leakage rate of 1.11 &#215; 10&#8722;5 cm2 and 3.36 &#215; 10&#8722;5 cm2 even over 6 months in water. Second, the Cs0.5FA0.5PbBr3 HPNCs and SHP&#8208;induced shattered&#8211;repaired perovskite glass substrate show the lowest lasing threshold values of 1.24 and 8.58 &#181;J cm&#8722;2, respectively. This work provides an integrative and in&#8208;depth approach to exploiting SHP with intrinsic and entropic self&#8208;healing capabilities combined with HPNCs to develop robust and reliable soft&#8208;electronic backlight and laser applications.

Organic Metal Halide Hybrids
Efficient electroluminescent devices can now be fabricated using solution&#8208;processed thin films based on 0D organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs). In article number 2209417, Biwu Ma and co&#8208;workers develop a highly luminescent 0D OMHH containing organic semiconducting cations, which successfully addresses the issues of low conductivity and poor energy alignment of existing 0D OMHHs for electrically driven light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs).

Aerogel Anodes
An innovative 3D cold trap environment printing (3DCEP) technology is proposed by Yujie Li, Jingxin Zhao, Bingang Xu, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2209886 to fabricate a highly aligned aerogel anode with MXene and Zn powder (3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8211;P). Benefitting from the combined induction of laminar flow and ice crystals in the 3DCEP process, MXene and Zn&#8211;P can be arranged in the Zn anode to achieve a unique Zn&#8208;dendrite inhibition effect.

         <title>Resistive Switching Crossbar Arrays Based on Layered Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resistive switching devices made of layered materials (LMs) have shown interesting performance. However, most studies employ fabrication methods and device structures that are not industry&#8208;relevant. In this review, the focus is on the status of crossbar arrays of LMs.








Abstract
Resistive switching (RS) devices are metal/insulator/metal cells that can change their electrical resistance when electrical stimuli are applied between the electrodes, and they can be used to store and compute data. Planar crossbar arrays of RS devices can offer a high integration density (&gt;108&#160;devices mm&#8722;2) and this can be further enhanced by stacking them three&#8208;dimensionally. The advantage of using layered materials (LMs) in RS devices compared to traditional phase&#8208;change materials and metal oxides is that their electrical properties can be adjusted with a higher precision. Here, the key figures&#8208;of&#8208;merit and procedures to implement LM&#8208;based RS devices are defined. LM&#8208;based RS devices fabricated using methods compatible with industry are identified and discussed. The focus is on small devices (size&#160;&lt;&#160;9&#160;&#181;m2) arranged in crossbar structures, since larger devices may be affected by artifacts, such as grain boundaries and flake junctions. How to enhance device performance, so to accelerate the development of this technology, is also discussed.
