      <title>GSH&#8208;Depleted Nanozymes with Hyperthermia&#8208;Enhanced Dual Enzyme&#8208;Mimic Activities for Tumor Nanocatalytic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Superior tumor inhibition effects of the bacteria&#8208;like nanozyme based on the hyperthermia&#8208;enhanced dual enzyme&#8208;mimic activities and glutathione depletion are reported.








Abstract
Nanocatalytic therapy, using artificial nanoscale enzyme mimics (nanozymes), is an emerging technology for therapeutic treatment of various malignant tumors. However, the relatively deficient catalytic activity of nanozymes in the tumor microenvironment (TME) restrains their biomedical applications. Here, a versatile and bacteria&#8208;like PEG/Ce&#8208;Bi@DMSN nanozyme is developed by coating uniform Bi2S3 nanorods (NRs) with dendritic mesoporous silica (Bi2S3@DMSN) and then decorating ultrasmall ceria nanozymes into the large mesopores of Bi2S3@DMSN. The nanozymes exhibit dual enzyme&#8208;mimic catalytic activities (peroxidase&#8208;mimic and catalase&#8208;mimic) under acidic conditions that can regulate the TME, that is, simultaneously elevate oxidative stress and relieve hypoxia. In addition, the nanozymes can effectively consume the overexpressed glutathione (GSH) through redox reaction. Photothermal therapy (PTT) is introduced to synergistically improve the dual enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalytic activities and depletion of the overexpressed GSH in the tumors by photonic hyperthermia. This is achieved by taking advantage of the desirable light absorbance in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window of the PEG/Ce&#8208;Bi@DMSN nanozymes. Subsequently the reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated therapeutic efficiency is significantly improved. Therefore, this study provides a proof of concept of hyperthermia&#8208;augmented multi&#8208;enzymatic activities of nanozymes for tumor ablation.

In addition, the nanozymes can effectively consume the overexpressed glutathione (GSH) through redox reaction. Photothermal therapy (PTT) is introduced to synergistically improve the dual enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalytic activities and depletion of the overexpressed GSH in the tumors by photonic hyperthermia. This is achieved by taking advantage of the desirable light absorbance in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window of the PEG/Ce&#8208;Bi@DMSN nanozymes. Subsequently the reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated therapeutic efficiency is significantly improved. Therefore, this study provides a proof of concept of hyperthermia&#8208;augmented multi&#8208;enzymatic activities of nanozymes for tumor ablation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Recent Advances on Mixed Metal Sulfides for Advanced Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Mixed metal sulfides are considered as promising negative electrode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. This unique class of electrodes has some distinct advantages in boosting sodium storage properties. Some recent advances in the rational design and synthesis of mixed metal sulfides as anode materials for sodium storage are summarized.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have drawn enormous attention in the past few years from both academic and industrial battery communities in view of the fascinating advantages of rich abundance and low cost of sodium resources. Among various electrode materials, mixed metal sulfides (MMSs) stand out as promising negative electrode materials for SIBs considering their superior structural and compositional advantages, such as decent electrochemical reversibility, high electronic conductivity, and rich redox reactions. Here, a summary of some recent developments in the rational design and synthesis of various kinds of MMSs with tailorable architectures, structural/compositional complexity, controllable morphologies, and enhanced electrochemical properties is presented. The effect of structural engineering and compositional design of MMSs on the sodium storage properties is highlighted. It is anticipated that further innovative works on the material design of advanced electrodes for batteries can be inspired.

      <title>Combating Implant Infections: Shifting Focus from Bacteria to Host</title>
      <dc:description>
Biomaterials are known to frustrate the immune system, rendering them more likely to be colonized by pathogens. The importance of host immunomodulation in the development of anti&#8208;infective biomaterials is described. Novel strategies in this field can help decrease the susceptibility to infection and the high reliance on antibiotic drugs.








Abstract
The widespread use of biomaterials to support or replace body parts is increasingly threatened by the risk of implant&#8208;associated infections. In the quest for finding novel anti&#8208;infective biomaterials, there generally has been a one&#8208;sided focus on biomaterials with direct antibacterial properties, which leads to excessive use of antibacterial agents, compromised host responses, and unpredictable effectiveness in vivo. This review sheds light on how host immunomodulation, rather than only targeting bacteria, can endow biomaterials with improved anti&#8208;infective properties. How antibacterial surface treatments are at risk to be undermined by biomaterial features that dysregulate the protection normally provided by critical immune cell subsets, namely, neutrophils and macrophages, is discussed. Accordingly, how the precise modification of biomaterial surface biophysical cues, or the incorporation of immunomodulatory drug delivery systems, can render biomaterials with the necessary immune&#8208;compatible and immune&#8208;protective properties to potentiate the host defense mechanisms is reviewed. Within this context, the protective role of host defense peptides, metallic particles, quorum sensing inhibitors, and therapeutic adjuvants is discussed. The highlighted immunomodulatory strategies may lay a foundation to develop anti&#8208;infective biomaterials, while mitigating the increasing threat of antibacterial drug resistance.

      <title>Multioperation&#8208;Mode Light&#8208;Emitting Field&#8208;Effect Transistors Based on van der Waals Heterostructure</title>
      <dc:description>
A light emitting transistor based on van der Waals heterostructure is demonstrated. Utilizing tunable graphene contacts, holes and electrons are separately injected into the ambipolar WSe2 monolayer. By balanced recombination of electrons and holes, the external quantum efficiency reaches &#8776;6% at room temperature. Multimode operation of this device powered by combination of electrical and optical states would be beneficial for optical circuitry.








Abstract
2D semiconductors have shown great potential for application to electrically tunable optoelectronics. Despite the strong excitonic photoluminescence (PL) of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), their efficient electroluminescence (EL) has not been achieved due to the low efficiency of charge injection and electron&#8211;hole recombination. Here, multioperation&#8208;mode light&#8208;emitting field&#8208;effect transistors (LEFETs) consisting of a monolayer WSe2 channel and graphene contacts coupled with two top gates for selective and balanced injection of charge carriers are demonstrated. Visibly observable EL is achieved with the high external quantum efficiency of &#8776;6% at room temperature due to efficient recombination of injected electrons and holes in a confined 2D channel. Further, electrical tunability of both the channel and contacts enables multioperation modes, such as antiambipolar, depletion,and unipolar regions, which can be utilized for polarity&#8208;tunable field&#8208;effect transistors and photodetectors. The work exhibits great potential for use in 2D semiconductor LEFETs for novel optoelectronics capable of high efficiency, multifunctions, and heterointegration.

      <title>Past, Present, and Future of Soft&#8208;Tissue Prosthetics: Advanced Polymers and Advanced Manufacturing</title>
      <dc:description>
Soft tissue prosthetics reduce suffering for millions experiencing disfigurement due to cancers, congenital defects, or trauma. Advanced manufacturing and advanced synthetic materials promise significantly improved realism and function, replacing traditional materials and labor intensive fabrication. Both traditional synthetic polymers and advanced manufacturing and materials are discussed in the context of soft tissue prosthetics, including future technologies and their potential.








Abstract
Millions of people worldwide experience disfigurement due to cancers, congenital defects, or trauma, leading to significant psychological, social, and economic disadvantage. Prosthetics aim to reduce their suffering by restoring aesthetics and function using synthetic materials that mimic the characteristics of native tissue. In the 1900s, natural materials used for thousands of years in prosthetics were replaced by synthetic polymers bringing about significant improvements in fabrication and greater realism and utility. These traditional methods have now been disrupted by the advanced manufacturing revolution, radically changing the materials, methods, and nature of prosthetics. In this report, traditional synthetic polymers and advanced prosthetic materials and manufacturing techniques are discussed, including a focus on prosthetic material degradation. New manufacturing approaches and future technological developments are also discussed in the context of specific tissues requiring aesthetic restoration, such as ear, nose, face, eye, breast, and hand. As advanced manufacturing moves from research into clinical practice, prosthetics can begin new age to significantly improve the quality of life for those suffering tissue loss or disfigurement.

      <title>Intercalation Pseudocapacitive Zn2+ Storage with Hydrated Vanadium Dioxide toward Ultrahigh Rate Performance</title>
      <dc:description>
A structural design method is presented wherein lattice defects and crystal water are introduced into vanadium dioxide. The high&#8208;rate electrochemical behavior stems from intercalation pseudocapacitance, promoting the surface&#8208;controlled capacitance feature. The suitable crystal structure makes the solid ion diffusion process no longer the rate&#8208;limiting step.








Abstract
The weak van der Waals interactions enable ion&#8208;intercalation&#8208;type hosts to be ideal pseudocapacitive materials for energy storage. Here, a methodology for the preparation of hydrated vanadium dioxide nanoribbon (HVO) with moderate transport pathways is proposed. Out of the ordinary, the intercalation pseudocapacitive reaction mechanism is discovered for HVO, which powers high&#8208;rate capacitive charge storage compared with the battery&#8208;type intercalation reaction. The main factor is that the defective crystalline structure provides suitable ambient spacing for rapidly accommodating and transporting cations. As a result, the HVO delivers a fast Zn2+ ion diffusion coefficient and a low Zn2+ diffusion barrier. The electrochemical results with intercalation pseudocapacitance demonstrate a high reversible capacity of 396 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.05 A g&#8722;1, and even maintain 88 mAh g&#8722;1 at a high current density of 50 A g&#8722;1.

The high&#8208;rate electrochemical behavior stems from intercalation pseudocapacitance, promoting the surface&#8208;controlled capacitance feature. The suitable crystal structure makes the solid ion diffusion process no longer the rate&#8208;limiting step.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weak van der Waals interactions enable ion&#8208;intercalation&#8208;type hosts to be ideal pseudocapacitive materials for energy storage. Here, a methodology for the preparation of hydrated vanadium dioxide nanoribbon (HVO) with moderate transport pathways is proposed. Out of the ordinary, the intercalation pseudocapacitive reaction mechanism is discovered for HVO, which powers high&#8208;rate capacitive charge storage compared with the battery&#8208;type intercalation reaction. The main factor is that the defective crystalline structure provides suitable ambient spacing for rapidly accommodating and transporting cations. As a result, the HVO delivers a fast Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion diffusion coefficient and a low Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion barrier. The electrochemical results with intercalation pseudocapacitance demonstrate a high reversible capacity of 396 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.05 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and even maintain 88 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at a high current density of 50 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Based on Group 3 and 4 Metals</title>
      <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) based on group 3 and 4 metals with high chemical stability, structural diversity, and various interesting properties are reviewed. Cluster and framework chemistry of group 3 and 4 metals are expected to provide a timely summary on MOF development, which shall guide the discovery and development of stable and functional MOFs for practical applications.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) based on group 3 and 4 metals are considered as the most promising MOFs for varying practical applications including water adsorption, carbon conversion, and biomedical applications. The relatively strong coordination bonds and versatile coordination modes within these MOFs endow the framework with high chemical stability, diverse structures and topologies, and interesting properties and functions. Herein, the significant progress made on this series of MOFs since 2018 is summarized and an update on the current status and future trends on the structural design of robust MOFs with high connectivity is provided. Cluster chemistry involving Y, lanthanides (Ln, from La to Lu), actinides (An, from Ac to Lr), Ti, and Zr is initially introduced. This is followed by a review of recently developed MOFs based on group 3 and 4 metals with their structures discussed based on the types of inorganic or organic building blocks. The novel properties and arising applications of these MOFs in catalysis, adsorption and separation, delivery, and sensing are highlighted. Overall, this review is expected to provide a timely summary on MOFs based on group 3 and 4 metals, which shall guide the future discovery and development of stable and functional MOFs for practical applications.

      <title>Fluorescent Diagnostic Probes in Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent progress in fluorescent diagnostic probes for detecting the biomarkers associated with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, spinal cord injury, and prion diseases is reviewed. Guides to develop new sensing strategies and recognition mechanisms, and the ideal features to further improve neurodegenerative disease fluorescence imaging, are also explored.








Abstract
Neurodegenerative diseases are debilitating disorders that feature progressive and selective loss of function or structure of anatomically or physiologically associated neuronal systems. Both chronic and acute neurodegenerative diseases are associated with high morbidity and mortality along with the death of neurons in different areas of the brain; moreover, there are few or no effective curative therapy options for treating these disorders. There is an urgent need to diagnose neurodegenerative disease as early as possible, and to distinguish between different disorders with overlapping symptoms that will help to decide the best clinical treatment. Recently, in neurodegenerative disease research, fluorescent&#8208;probe&#8208;mediated biomarker visualization techniques have been gaining increasing attention for the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. A survey of fluorescent probes for sensing and imaging biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases is provided. These imaging probes are categorized based on the different potential biomarkers of various neurodegenerative diseases, and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed. Guides to develop new sensing strategies, recognition mechanisms, as well as the ideal features to further improve neurodegenerative disease fluorescence imaging are also explored.

      <title>A Continuously Tunable Solid&#8208;Like Convective Thermal Metadevice on the Reciprocal Line</title>
      <dc:description>
A solid&#8208;like convective thermal metadevice is proposed. It can disguise any target as a solid material with a continuously tunable thermal conductivity in a wide range. This is achieved by restoring the reciprocity of a convective system on the reciprocal line, based on its effective thermal conductivity.








Abstract
The emerging thermal metamaterials and metadevices demonstrate significant potential to transform thermal conduction. However, the thermal conductivities of existing devices are all restricted at fixed values if the configuration or constituent materials are static. Thermal convection provides an additional tool to boost and flexibly modify the heat transfer in moving matter, but it is essentially distinct from thermal conduction since the Onsager reciprocity is generally broken in the former but preserved in the latter. Therefore, it is difficult to use convective components for sophisticated control of conductive heat. Here, it is shown that a convective system can be made undistinguishable from a conductive one in principle, by discovering and operating on the reciprocal line of mechanically rotating systems. The realized thermal metadevice can thus mimic a solid&#8208;like material whose thermal conductivity dynamically covers a wide range. It offers great possibilities of real&#8208;time smooth control over heat transfer for broad applications.

      <title>Surface and Interface Engineering for Nanocellulosic Advanced Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanocelluloses, the natural reinforcement for plants, are incredibly strong and stiff, and are therefore under great scrutiny for incorporation in sustainable, ecofriendly, and strong man&#8208;made materials. Nanocelluloses enable dramatic tailoring of surface chemistry, interface interactions, and functionalities via chemical and/or physical surface and interface engineering that permit assembly of diverse nanocellulosic materials. Some of the promising progress in this area is reviewed.








Abstract
How do trees support their upright massive bodies? The support comes from the incredibly strong and stiff, and highly crystalline nanoscale fibrils of extended cellulose chains, called cellulose nanofibers. Cellulose nanofibers and their crystalline parts&#8212;cellulose nanocrystals, collectively nanocelluloses, are therefore the recent hot materials to incorporate in man&#8208;made sustainable, environmentally sound, and mechanically strong materials. Nanocelluloses are generally obtained through a top&#8208;down process, during or after which the original surface chemistry and interface interactions can be dramatically changed. Therefore, surface and interface engineering are extremely important when nanocellulosic materials with a bottom&#8208;up process are fabricated. Herein, the main focus is on promising chemical modification and nonmodification approaches, aiming to prospect this hot topic from novel aspects, including nanocellulose&#8208;, chemistry&#8208;, and process&#8208;oriented surface and interface engineering for advanced nanocellulosic materials. The reinforcement of nanocelluloses in some functional materials, such as structural materials, films, filaments, aerogels, and foams, is discussed, relating to tailored surface and/or interface engineering. Although some of the nanocellulosic products have already reached the industrial arena, it is hoped that more and more nanocellulose&#8208;based products will become available in everyday life in the next few years.

      <title>Recent Advances of Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy for Microporous Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent progress in the application of solid&#8208;state NMR in the study of microporous materials is reviewed. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopies for characterization of the structures and dynamics of microporous materials are summarized. The obtained atomic&#8208;level information that allows understanding of the structure&#8211;performance relationships is highlighted.








Abstract
Microporous materials have attracted a rapid growth of research interest in materials science and the multidisciplinary area because of their wide applications in catalysis, separation, ion exchange, gas storage, drug release, and sensing. A fundamental understanding of their diverse structures and properties is crucial for rational design of high&#8208;performance materials and technological applications in industry. Solid&#8208;state NMR (SSNMR), capable of providing atomic&#8208;level information on both structure and dynamics, is a powerful tool in the scientific exploration of solid materials. Here, advanced SSNMR instruments and methods for characterization of microporous materials are briefly described. The recent progress of the application of SSNMR for the investigation of microporous materials including zeolites, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, porous aromatic frameworks, and layered materials is discussed with representative work. The versatile SSNMR techniques provide detailed information on the local structure, dynamics, and chemical processes in the confined space of porous materials. The challenges and prospects in SSNMR study of microporous and related materials are discussed.

      <title>3D Printing: 3D Printing of Microgel&#8208;Loaded Modular Microcages as Instructive Scaffolds for Tissue Engineering (Adv. Mater. 36/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2001736, Luiz E. Bertassoni and co&#8208;workers present the use of lithography&#8208;based 3D printing to fabricate a novel modular microcage scaffold system. These hollow microcages can be stacked in thousands of geometric configurations with the ability to scale in size and shape to fit complex tissue defects. Different growth factors and cells can be placed inside each block, enabling cell&#8208;instructive and accelerated repair of musculoskeletal tissue injuries.

In article number 2002784, Qin Hu, Haiming Zhu, Feng Liu, and co&#8208;workers use in situ grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering techniques to study the crystallization kinetics of 2D perovskites and reveal the role of additives in the crystallization process. The synergy between DMSO and KI additives can improve the crystal orientation and effectively passivate defects, owing to the sandwich&#8208;type distribution of K+, delivering a high efficiency of 16.48%.

      <title>Metasurfaces: Coherent Perfect Diffraction in Metagratings (Adv. Mater. 36/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
Coherent control of metagratings through multiple wave excitations provides new opportunities for highly reconfigurable broadband metasurfaces with large diffraction efficiency, beyond the limitations of conventional approaches. In article number 2002341, Ming Kang, Xueqian Zhang, Alex Krasnok, Jiaguang Han, Andrea Al&#249;, and co&#8208;workers discover that energy distribution between the diffraction orders can be continuously controlled on&#8208;demand by simply changing the relative phase difference between two excitation signals.

In article number &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.2020023412002341&lt;/a&gt;, Ming Kang, Xueqian Zhang, Alex Krasnok, Jiaguang Han, Andrea Al&#249;, and co&#8208;workers discover that energy distribution between the diffraction orders can be continuously controlled on&#8208;demand by simply changing the relative phase difference between two excitation signals.

A sky&#8208;blue&#8208;exciplex&#8208;forming host constructed by &#960;&#8211;donor and &#960;&#8211;acceptor with bipolar &#960;&#8208;spacers is used to fabricate single&#8208;emissive&#8208;layer all&#8208;fluorescent white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, leading to stable warm white emission with a record&#8208;high power efficiency of 69.6 lm W&#8722;1 and a long T80 (time to 80% of the initial luminance) of &gt;8200 h at 1000 cd m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Exciplex&#8208;forming hosts with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) provide a viable opportunity to unlock the full potential of the yet&#8208;to&#8208;be improved power efficiencies (PEs) and stabilities of all&#8208;fluorescent white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (WOLEDs), but this, however, is hindered by the lack of stable blue exciplexes. Here, an advanced exciplex system is proposed by incorporating bipolar charge&#8208;transport &#960;&#8208;spacers into both the electron&#8208;donor (D) and the electron&#8208;accepter (A) to increase their distance for hypsochromic&#8208;shifted emission while maintaining the superior transporting ability. By using spirofluorene as the &#960;&#8208;spacer, 3,3&#8242;&#8208;bicarbazole as the D&#8208;unit, and 2,4,6&#8208;triphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine as the A&#8208;unit, a &#960;&#8211;D and &#960;&#8211;A exciplex with sky&#8208;blue emission and fast reverse intersystem crossing process is thereof constructed. Combining this exciplex&#8208;forming host, a blue TADF&#8208;sensitizer, and a yellow conventional fluorescent dopant in a single&#8208;emissive&#8208;layer, the fabricated warm&#8208;white&#8208;emissive device simultaneously exhibits a low driving voltage of 3.08 V, an external quantum efficiency of 21.4%, and a remarkable T80 (time to 80% of the initial luminance) of &gt;8200 h at 1000 cd m&#8722;2, accompanied by a new benchmark PE of 69.6 lm W&#8722;1 among all&#8208;fluorescent WOLEDs.

      <title>Recent Progress in Graphene/Polymer Nanocomposites</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent progress on graphene/polymer nanocomposites is reviewed with emphasis on strengthening and toughening, electrical conduction, thermal transportation, and photothermal conversion. The roles of graphene configuration, interfacial interaction, and distribution of graphene in the polymer to determine the properties of the nanocomposites are systematically explored. This may provide constructive guidance to develop high&#8208;performance nanocomposites in the future.








Abstract
Nanocomposites, multiphase solid materials with at least one nanoscaled component, have been attracting ever&#8208;increasing attention because of their unique properties. Graphene is an ideal filler for high&#8208;performance multifunctional nanocomposites in light of its superior mechanical, electrical, thermal, and optical properties. However, the 2D nature of graphene usually gives rise to highly anisotropic features, which brings new opportunities to tailor nanocomposites by making full use of its excellent in&#8208;plane properties. Here, recent progress on graphene/polymer nanocomposites is summarized with emphasis on strengthening/toughening, electrical conduction, thermal transportation, and photothermal energy conversion. The influence of the graphene configuration, including layer number, defects, and lateral size, on its intrinsic properties and the properties of graphene/polymer nanocomposites is systematically analyzed. Meanwhile, the role of the interfacial interaction between graphene and polymer in affecting the properties of nanocomposites is also explored. The correlation between the graphene distribution in the matrix and the properties of the nanocomposite is discussed in detail. The key challenges and possible solutions are also addressed. This review may provide a constructive guidance for preparing high&#8208;performance graphene/polymer nanocomposite in the future.

      <title>Effective Modulation of CNS Inhibitory Microenvironment using Bioinspired Hybrid&#8208;Nanoscaffold&#8208;Based Therapeutic Interventions</title>
      <dc:description>
Current biomaterials&#8208;based treatment of central nervous system (CNS) injuries has been hampered by the resulting neuroinhibitory microenvironment. By targeting two critical neuroinhibitory factors in a single platform, a biomimetic 3D porous hybrid nanoscaffold is created by developing viscous interfacial self&#8208;assembly. The nanoscaffold&#8208;based therapeutic interventions achieve functional recovery through reducing neuroinflammation and fibrotic scarring, thereby paving a new road for the biomaterials&#8208;based treatment of CNS injuries.








Abstract
Central nervous system (CNS) injuries are often debilitating, and most currently have no cure. This is due to the formation of a neuroinhibitory microenvironment at injury sites, which includes neuroinflammatory signaling and non&#8208;permissive extracellular matrix (ECM) components. To address this challenge, a viscous interfacial self&#8208;assembly approach, to generate a bioinspired hybrid 3D porous nanoscaffold platform for delivering anti&#8208;inflammatory molecules and establish a favorable 3D&#8208;ECM environment for the effective suppression of the neuroinhibitory microenvironment, is developed. By tailoring the structural and biochemical properties of the 3D porous nanoscaffold, enhanced axonal growth from the dual&#8208;targeting therapeutic strategy in a human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)&#8208;based in vitro model of neuroinflammation is demonstrated. Moreover, nanoscaffold&#8208;based approaches promote significant axonal growth and functional recovery in vivo in a spinal cord injury model through a unique mechanism of anti&#8208;inflammation&#8208;based fibrotic scar reduction. Given the critical role of neuroinflammation and ECM microenvironments in neuroinhibitory signaling, the developed nanobiomaterial&#8208;based therapeutic intervention may pave a new road for treating CNS injuries.

      <title>Nanometer&#8208;Scale Uniform Conductance Switching in Molecular Memristors</title>
      <dc:description>
A&#160;well&#8208;known&#160;problem of all the existing resistive&#8208;switching mechanisms is that they are inherently nonuniform and suffer from stochastic variability. This long&#8208;standing problem is resolved by demonstrating a 100% areally uniform current switching driven by molecular redox, characterized via concurrent conductive atomic force microscopy and tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy with &lt;7 nm resolution.








Abstract
One common challenge highlighted in almost every review article on organic resistive memory is the lack of areal switching uniformity. This, in fact, is a puzzle because a molecular switching mechanism should ideally be isotropic and produce homogeneous current switching free from electroforming. Such a demonstration, however, remains elusive to date. The reports attempting to characterize a nanoscopic picture of switching in molecular films show random current spikes, just opposite to the expectation. Here, this longstanding conundrum is resolved by demonstrating 100% spatially homogeneous current switching (driven by molecular redox) in memristors based on Ru&#8208;complexes of azo&#8208;aromatic ligands. Through a concurrent nanoscopic spatial mapping using conductive atomic force microscopy and in operando tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (both with resolution &lt;7 nm),&#160;it is shown that molecular switching in the films is uniform from hundreds of micrometers down to the nanoscale and that conductance value exactly correlates with spectroscopically determined molecular redox states. This provides a deterministic molecular route to obtain spatially homogeneous, forming&#8208;free switching that can conceivably overcome the chronic problems of robustness, consistency, reproducibility, and scalability in organic memristors.

Through a concurrent nanoscopic spatial mapping using conductive atomic force microscopy and in operando tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (both with resolution &amp;lt;7 nm),&#160;it is shown that molecular switching in the films is uniform from hundreds of micrometers down to the nanoscale and that conductance value exactly correlates with spectroscopically determined molecular redox states. This provides a deterministic molecular route to obtain spatially homogeneous, forming&#8208;free switching that can conceivably overcome the chronic problems of robustness, consistency, reproducibility, and scalability in organic memristors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Multifunctional Charge Transporting Materials for Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
      <dc:description>
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes attract much attention because of their advantages such as high color purity, easy and wide color tunability, and high photoluminescence quantum yields. The recent developments of ideal multifunctional charge transport layers are discussed by considering the fundamental limitations including defects, morphological and phase instability, high refractive index, and poor outcoupling of perovskites.








Abstract
Despite their low exciton&#8208;binding energies, metal halide perovskites are extensively studied as light&#8208;emitting materials owing to narrow emission with high color purity, easy/wide color tunability, and high photoluminescence quantum yields. To improve the efficiency of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs), much effort has been devoted to controlling the emitting layer morphologies to induce charge confinement and decrease the nonradiative recombination. The interfaces between the emitting layer and charge transporting layer (CTL) are vulnerable to various defects that deteriorate the efficiency and stability of the PeLEDs. Therefore, the establishment of multifunctional CTLs that can improve not only charge transport but also critical factors that influence device performance, such as defect passivation, morphology/phase control, ion migration suppression, and light outcoupling efficiency, are highly required. Herein, the fundamental limitations of perovskites as emitters (i.e., defects, morphological and phase instability, high refractive index with poor outcoupling) and the recent developments with regard to multifunctional CTLs to compensate such limitations are summarized, and their device applications are also reviewed. Finally, based on the importance of multifunctional CTLs, the outlook and research prospects of multifunctional CTLs for the further improvement of PeLEDs are discussed.

      <title>Nonmetal Current Collectors: The Key Component for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Aluminum Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel nonmetal current collector for aluminum batteries is demonstrated to substantially promote the chemical and electrochemical stability in an acidic ionic&#8208;liquid electrolyte. The energy&#8208;storage performance is enhanced obviously in terms of decreasing the mass ratio of the materials in the positive electrode. The results offer a novel strategy for assembling highly stable electrodes to achieve high&#8208;performance aluminum batteries.








Abstract
As one of the emerging safe energy&#8208;storage devices with high energy&#8208;to&#8208;cost ratio, nonaqueous aluminum batteries with enhanced energy density are intensively pursued by researchers. Although significant progress has been made on positive electrode materials, the effective energy density of aluminum batteries is still limited by the presence of high&#8208;density refractory metal current collectors, which are known to be electrochemically inert in highly acidic ionic&#8208;liquid electrolytes. To address such critical issues, here, a novel low&#8208;density (&lt;2 g cm&#8722;3) nonmetal current collector is presented, which uses poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) substrates coated with indium tin oxide (ITO), with the purpose of significantly reducing the ratio of nonactive components in the electrodes. In addition to the excellent chemical and electrochemical stability (with voltage as high as &#8776;2.75 V vs Al3+/Al), this nonmetal current collector, also encompassing a carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) binder, allows as&#8208;assembled pouch cells to deliver a reversible specific capacity of &#8776;120 mAh g&#8722;1 at a current density of 50 mA g&#8722;1. In comparison with the high&#8208;density refractory metal Mo or Ta current collectors, these nonmetal current collectors offer a novel strategy for constructing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density aluminum batteries by substituting the key components, with the aim of boosting the energy density of nonaqueous aluminum batteries.

      <title>Gap States in Methylammonium Lead Halides: The Link to Dimethylsulfoxide?</title>
      <dc:description>
Minimization of gap states in halide perovskites is crucial for approaching theoretical device limit. This work correlates the appearance of gap states in methylammonium lead halides and the presence of dimethylsulfoxide in the processing solution. The results suggest the link between the products of the dimethylsulfoxide&#8211;methylammonium reaction and the gap states. Replacement with a non&#8208;reactive additive eliminates these gap states.








Abstract
Understanding the origin and distribution of electronic gap states in metal halide perovskite (MHP) thin films is crucial to the further improvement of the efficiency and long&#8208;term stability of MHP&#8208;based optoelectronic devices. In this work, the impact of Lewis&#8208;basic additives introduced in the precursor solution on the density of states in the perovskite bandgap is investigated. Ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy and contact potential difference measurements are conducted on MHP thin films processed from dimethylformamide (DMF)&#8208;based solutions to which either no additive, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), or N&#8208;methylpyrrolidine&#8208;2&#8208;thione (NMPT) is&#160;added. The results show the presence of a density of states in the gap of methylammonium lead halide films processed from DMSO&#8208;containing solution. The density of gap states is either suppressed when the methylammonium concentration in mixed cation films is reduced or when NMPT is used as an additive, and eliminated when methylammonium (MA) is replaced with cesium or formamidinium (FA). These results are consistent with the notion that reaction products that result from DMSO reacting with MA+ in the precursor solution are responsible for the formation of gap states.

      <title>Sensitive and Stable 2D Perovskite Single&#8208;Crystal X&#8208;ray Detectors Enabled by a Supramolecular Anchor</title>
      <dc:description>
F atoms in an organic spacer of a 2D perovskite enhance the supramolecular electrostatic interactions, serving as supramolecular anchors to stabilize single crystals. The corresponding optoelectronic properties are also improved. A fluorophenethylammonium lead iodide X&#8208;ray detector exhibits stable and sensitive response to 120 keVp X&#8208;rays; clear X&#8208;ray images with detection limit of 23 nGy s&#8722;1 are demonstrated.








Abstract
Perovskite X&#8208;ray detectors have been demonstrated to be sensitive to soft X&#8208;rays (&lt;80 keV) for potential medical imaging applications. However, developing X&#8208;ray detectors that are stable and sensitive to hard X&#8208;rays (80 to 120 keV) for practical medical imaging is highly desired. Here, a sensitive 2D fluorophenethylammonium lead iodide ((F&#8208;PEA)2PbI4) perovskite single&#8208;crystal hard&#8208;X&#8208;ray detector from low&#8208;cost solution processes is reported. Dipole interaction of organic ions promotes the ordering of benzene rings as well as the supramolecular electrostatic interaction between electron&#8208;deficient F atoms with neighbor benzene rings. Supramolecular interactions serve as a supramolecular anchor to stabilize and tune the electronic properties of single crystals. The 2D (F&#8208;PEA)2PbI4 perovskite single crystal exhibits an intrinsic property with record bulk resistivity of 1.36 &#215; 1012 &#937; cm, which brings a low device noise for hard X&#8208;ray detection. Meanwhile, the ion&#8208;migration phenomenon is effectively suppressed, even under the large applied bias of 200 V, by blocking the ion migration paths after anchoring. Consequently, the (F&#8208;PEA)2PbI4 single crystal detector yields a sensitivity of 3402 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1air cm&#8722;2 to 120 keVp hard X&#8208;rays with lowest detectable X&#8208;ray dose rate of 23 nGyair s&#8722;1, outperforming the dominating CsI scintillator of commercial digital radiography systems by acquiring clear X&#8208;ray images under much lower dose rate. In addition, the detector shows high operation stability under extremely high&#8208;flux X&#8208;ray irradiation.

      <title>ATP&#8208;Responsive and ATP&#8208;Fueled Self&#8208;Assembling Systems and Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
The use of ATP&#8212;the energy currency of life&#8212;for self&#8208;assembling systems via non&#8208;enzymatic and enzymatic mechanisms, which are categorized as ATP&#8208;triggered unidirectional self&#8208;assemblies, counter&#8208;trigger&#8208;mediated reversible self&#8208;assemblies, and ATP&#8208;fueled autonomous systems, is reviewed. Concepts from different fields, such as supramolecular chemistry and DNA nanoscience, are brought together, and concept development from equilibrium to non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;assemblies is elaborated.








Abstract
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a central metabolite that plays an indispensable role in various cellular processes, from energy supply to cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell signaling. Nature has developed sophisticated strategies to use the energy stored in ATP for many metabolic and non&#8208;equilibrium processes, and to sense and bind ATP for biological signaling. The variations in the ATP concentrations from one organelle to another, from extracellular to intracellular environments, and from normal cells to cancer cells are one motivation for designing ATP&#8208;triggered and ATP&#8208;fueled systems and materials, because they show great potential for applications in biological systems by using ATP as a trigger or chemical fuel. Over the last decade, ATP has been emerging as an attractive co&#8208;assembling component for man&#8208;made stimuli&#8208;responsive as well as for fuel&#8208;driven active systems and materials. Herein, current advances and emerging concepts for ATP&#8208;triggered and ATP&#8208;fueled self&#8208;assemblies and materials are discussed, shedding light on applications and highlighting future developments. By bringing together concepts of different domains, that is from supramolecular chemistry to DNA nanoscience, from equilibrium to non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;assembly, and from fundamental sciences to applications, the aim is to cross&#8208;fertilize current approaches with the ultimate aim to bring synthetic ATP&#8208;dependent systems closer to living systems.

&lt;p&gt;The use of ATP&#8212;the energy currency of life&#8212;for self&#8208;assembling systems via non&#8208;enzymatic and enzymatic mechanisms, which are categorized as ATP&#8208;triggered unidirectional self&#8208;assemblies, counter&#8208;trigger&#8208;mediated reversible self&#8208;assemblies, and ATP&#8208;fueled autonomous systems, is reviewed. Concepts from different fields, such as supramolecular chemistry and DNA nanoscience, are brought together, and concept development from equilibrium to non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;assemblies is elaborated.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a central metabolite that plays an indispensable role in various cellular processes, from energy supply to cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell signaling. Nature has developed sophisticated strategies to use the energy stored in ATP for many metabolic and non&#8208;equilibrium processes, and to sense and bind ATP for biological signaling. The variations in the ATP concentrations from one organelle to another, from extracellular to intracellular environments, and from normal cells to cancer cells are one motivation for designing ATP&#8208;triggered and ATP&#8208;fueled systems and materials, because they show great potential for applications in biological systems by using ATP as a trigger or chemical fuel. Over the last decade, ATP has been emerging as an attractive co&#8208;assembling component for man&#8208;made stimuli&#8208;responsive as well as for fuel&#8208;driven active systems and materials. Herein, current advances and emerging concepts for ATP&#8208;triggered and ATP&#8208;fueled self&#8208;assemblies and materials are discussed, shedding light on applications and highlighting future developments. By bringing together concepts of different domains, that is from supramolecular chemistry to DNA nanoscience, from equilibrium to non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;assembly, and from fundamental sciences to applications, the aim is to cross&#8208;fertilize current approaches with the ultimate aim to bring synthetic ATP&#8208;dependent systems closer to living systems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Self&#8208;Densification of Highly Mesoporous Wood Structure into a Strong and Transparent Film</title>
      <dc:description>
TEMPO&#8208;mediated oxidation under neutral conditions using the TEMPO/NaClO/NaClO2 system is developed for delignified balsa wood. Individualization of cellulose microfibrils within the wood cell wall is achieved without mechanical disintegration. The resulting highly mesoporous oxidized wood structure can self&#8208;densify at ambient conditions to form a strong and transparent cellulose film, driven by the elastocapillary forces upon water evaporation.








Abstract
In the native wood cell wall, cellulose microfibrils are highly aligned and organized in the secondary cell wall. A new preparation strategy is developed to achieve individualization of cellulose microfibrils within the wood cell wall structure without introducing mechanical disintegration. The resulting mesoporous wood structure has a high specific surface area of 197 m2 g&#8722;1 when prepared by freeze&#8208;drying using liquid nitrogen, and 249 m2 g&#8722;1 by supercritical drying. These values are 5 to 7 times higher than conventional delignified wood (36 m2 g&#8722;1) dried by supercritical drying. Such highly mesoporous structure with individualized cellulose microfibrils maintaining their natural alignment and organization can be processed into aerogels with high porosity and high compressive strength. In addition, a strong film with a tensile strength of 449.1 &#177; 21.8 MPa and a Young's modulus of 51.1 &#177; 5.2 GPa along the fiber direction is obtained simply by air drying owing to the self&#8208;densification of cellulose microfibrils driven by the elastocapillary forces upon water evaporation. The self&#8208;densified film also shows high optical transmittance (80%) and high optical haze (70%) with interesting biaxial light scattering behavior owing to the natural alignment of cellulose microfibrils.

      <title>An &#8220;Ether&#8208;In&#8208;Water&#8221; Electrolyte Boosts Stable Interfacial Chemistry for Aqueous Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel &#8220;ether&#8208;in&#8208;water&#8221; electrolyte is demonstrated by introducing the non&#8208;aqueous co&#8208;solvent TEGDME into an aqueous electrolyte. The designed Li4(TEGDME)(H2O)7 solvation sheath structure with stable interfacial chemistry dynamically expands the electrochemical stability window to 4.2 V. Meanwhile, the high&#8208;quality solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) and cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface (CEI) derived from the reduction of Li+2(TFSI&#8722;) and Li+4(TEGDME) effectively suppress hydrogen/oxygen evolution and electrode dissolution.








Abstract
Aqueous batteries are promising devices for electrochemical energy storage because of their high ionic conductivity, safety, low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, their voltage output and energy density are limited by the failure to form a solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) that can expand the inherently narrow electrochemical window of water (1.23 V) imposed by hydrogen and oxygen evolution. Here, a novel (Li4(TEGDME)(H2O)7) is proposed as a solvation electrolyte with stable interfacial chemistry. By introducing tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME) into a concentrated aqueous electrolyte, a new carbonaceous component for both cathode&#8722;electrolyte interface and SEI formation is generated. In situ characterizations and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations reveal a bilayer hybrid interface composed of inorganic LiF and organic carbonaceous species reduced from Li+2(TFSI&#8722;) and Li+4(TEGDME). Consequently, the interfacial films kinetically broaden the electrochemical stability window to 4.2 V, thus realizing a 2.5 V LiMn2O4&#8722;Li4Ti5O12 full battery with an excellent energy density of 120 W h kg&#8722;1 for 500 cycles. The results provide an in&#8208;depth, mechanistic understanding of a potential design of more effective interphases for next&#8208;generation aqueous lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

      <title>Observation and Ultrafast Dynamics of Inter&#8208;Sub&#8208;Band Transition in InAs Twinning Superlattice Nanowires</title>
      <dc:description>
The periodically spaced twin boundaries in semiconductors could introduce extraordinary miniband structure and lead to mid&#8208;infrared inter&#8208;sub&#8208;band transitions. Near&#8208;field infrared nano spectroscopy is employed to reveal this subtle but substantial mid&#8208;infrared transition in twin boundaries of well&#8208;engineered InAs twinning superlattice nanowires. Near&#8208;field pump&#8211;probe measurements demonstrate rich details of the mid&#8208;infrared transition dynamics.








Abstract
A variety of infrared applications rely on semiconductor superlattices, including, notably, the realization of high&#8208;power, compact quantum cascade lasers. Requirements for atomically smooth interface and limited lattice matching options set high technical standards for fabricating applicable heterostructure devices. The semiconductor twinning superlattice (TSL) forms in a single compound with periodically spaced twin boundaries and sharp interface junctions and can be grown with convenient synthesis methods. Therefore, employing semiconductor TSL may facilitate the development of optoelectronic applications related to superlattice structures. Here, it is shown that InAs TSL nanowires generate inter&#8208;sub&#8208;band transition channels due to the band projection and the Bragg&#8208;like electron reflection. The findings reveal the physical mechanisms of inter&#8208;sub&#8208;band transitions in TSL structure and suggest that TSL structures are promising candidates for mid&#8208;infrared optoelectronic applications.

      <title>Confined Fe&#8211;Cu Clusters as Sub&#8208;Nanometer Reactors for Efficiently Regulating the Electrochemical Nitrogen Reduction Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>
The utilization of regular surface cavities with unique microenvironment on graphitic carbon nitride as &#8220;subnano reactors&#8221; can precisely confine multiple Fe and Cu atoms for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) electrocatalysis. The synergy of Fe and Cu atoms in such confined subnano space provides significantly enhanced NRR performance, in terms of much increased ammonia yield and faradic efficiency.








Abstract
Electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) over nonprecious&#8208;metal and single&#8208;atom catalysts has received increasing attention as a sustainable strategy to synthesize ammonia. However, the atomic&#8208;scale regulation of such active sites for NRR catalysis remains challenging because of the large distance between them, which significantly weakens their cooperation. Herein, the utilization of regular surface cavities with unique microenvironment on graphitic carbon nitride as &#8220;subnano reactors&#8221; to precisely confine multiple Fe and Cu atoms for NRR electrocatalysis is reported. The synergy of Fe and Cu atoms in such confined subnano space provides significantly enhanced NRR performance, with nearly doubles ammonia yield and 54%&#8208;increased Faradic efficiency up to 34%, comparing with the single&#8208;metal counterparts. First principle simulation reveals this synergistic effect originates from the unique Fe&#8211;Cu coordination, which effectively modifies the N2 absorption, improves electron transfer, and offers extra redox couples for NRR. This work thus provides new strategies of manipulating catalysts active centers at the sub&#8208;nanometer scale.

      <title>Supramolecular Chiral Aggregates Exhibiting Nonlinear CD&#8211;ee Dependence</title>
      <dc:description>
The research progress of nonlinear CD&#8211;ee dependence in the dynamic supramolecular aggregates, positive and negative, are summarized from the viewpoint of their discoveries, experimental observations, theoretical descriptions, and applications, in a hope to facilitate a better understanding of supramolecular chirality and the fabrication of functional supramolecular chiral materials.








Abstract
Although a linear relationship between the optical activity (normally the CD signal) and the enantiomeric excess (ee) of chiral auxiliaries has been the most commonly observed dependence in dynamic supramolecular helical aggregates, positive nonlinear CD&#8211;ee dependence, known as the &#8220;majority&#8208;rules effect&#8221; (MRE), indicative of chiral amplification, has also been well documented and to some extent understood. In sharp contrast, the negative nonlinear CD&#8211;ee dependence has been much less reported and is not well understood. Here, the state of the art of both the positive and negative nonlinear CD&#8211;ee dependence in noncovalently bound supramolecular helical aggregates is summarized, with the hope that the vast examples of supramolecular aggregates showing positive nonlinear dependence, in terms of the methods of investigations, variations in the structure of the building block (single species or multiple species), and theoretical modeling using the mismatch penalty energy and helix reversal penalty energy, would help to guide the design of building blocks to form aggregates showing negative nonlinear dependence, and thus to understand the mechanisms. The potential applications of those functional supramolecular aggregates are also discussed.

      <title>Reconstruction&#8208;Determined Alkaline Water Electrolysis at Industrial Temperatures</title>
      <dc:description>
Complete reconstruction of molybdate oxygen&#8208;evolving pre&#8208;catalysts and its fundamental understanding at industrial temperatures of 50&#8211;80 &#176;C are uncovered. In situ low&#8208;/high&#8208;temperature Raman and electron tomography identify the reconstruction mechanism, real active species, and stereoscopic structural characteristics. The boundary&#8211;vacancy co&#8208;effect enables the fast catalytic kinetics. The coupled cat.&#8208;51.9 and MoO2&#8208;Ni hydrogen&#8208;evolving arrays provide stable electrolysis operation (220 h) at 51.9 &#176;C.








Abstract
Evaluating the alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) at 50&#8211;80 &#176;C required in industry can veritably promote practical applications. Here, the thermally induced complete reconstruction (TICR) of molybdate oxygen evolution reaction (OER) pre&#8208;catalysts at 51.9 &#176;C and its fundamental mechanism are uncovered. The dynamic reconstruction processes, the real active species, and stereoscopic structural characteristics are identified by in situ low&#8208;/high&#8208;temperature Raman, ex situ microscopy, and electron tomography. The completely reconstructed (CR) catalyst (denoted as cat.&#8208;51.9) is interconnected by thermodynamically stable (oxy)hydroxide nanoparticles, with abundant boundaries and low crystallinity. For alkaline OER, cat.&#8208;51.9 exhibits a low overpotential (282.3 mV at 20 mA cm&#8722;2, 25.0 &#176;C) and ultrastable catalysis at 51.9 &#176;C (250 h, with a negligible activity decay of 19.6 &#181;V h&#8722;1). The experimental observations combined with theoretical analyses confirm the fast catalytic kinetics enabled by the co&#8208;effect of boundaries and vacancies. The coupled cat.&#8208;51.9 and MoO2&#8208;Ni hydrogen&#8208;evolving arrays provide stable electrolysis operation at 51.9 &#176;C for 220 h. This work uncovers new reconstruction phenomenon of pre&#8208;catalysts under realistic conditions and exceptional durability of CR catalysts toward practical high&#8208;temperature AWE.

Highly flexible and robust low&#8208;temperature solution&#8208;processed amorphous indium&#8211;gallium&#8211;zinc&#8211;oxide thin&#8208;film transistors and their integrated seven&#8208;stage ring oscillators are realized by using a stress&#8208;diffusive mesa&#8208;structured substrate.

Abstract
The increasing interest in flexible and wearable electronics has demanded a dramatic improvement of mechanical robustness in electronic devices along with high&#8208;resolution implemented architectures. In this study, a site&#8208;specific stress&#8208;diffusive manipulation is demonstrated to fulfill highly robust and ultraflexible amorphous indium&#8211;gallium&#8211;zinc oxide (a&#8208;IGZO) thin&#8208;film transistors (TFTs) and integrated circuits. The photochemically activated combustion sol&#8211;gel a&#8208;IGZO TFTs on a mesa&#8208;structured polyimide show an average saturation mobility of 6.06 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and a threshold voltage of &#8722;0.99 V with less than 9% variation, followed by 10 000 bending cycles with a radius of 125 &#956;m. More importantly, the site&#8208;specific monolithic formation of mesa pillar&#8208;structured devices can provide fully integrated logic circuits such as seven&#8208;stage ring&#8208;oscillators, meeting the industrially needed device density and scalability. To exploit the underlying stress&#8208;diffusive mechanism, a physical model is provided by using a variety of chemical, structural, and electrical characterizations along with multidomain finite&#8208;element analysis simulation. The physical models reveal that a highly scalable and robust device can be achieved via the site&#8208;specific mesa architecture, by enabling generation of multineutral layers and fine&#8208;tuning the accumulated stresses on specific element of devices with their diffusion out into the boundary of the mesa regions.

      <title>Reduced Graphene Oxide&#8208;Encapsulated Microfiber Patterns Enable Controllable Formation of Neuronal&#8208;Like Networks</title>
      <dc:description>
Conductive microfiber scaffolds are fabricated by combining near&#8208;field electrostatic printing (NFEP) and layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (L&#8208;b&#8208;L) assembly technologies. In situ reduction of graphene oxide L&#8208;b&#8208;L coated on NFEP microfibers yields conductive scaffolds with superior conductivity (&#8776;0.95 S cm&#8211;1) and the ability to guide neuronal&#8208;like network formation under electrical stimulation.








Abstract
Scaffold&#8208;guided formation of neuronal&#8208;like networks, especially under electrical stimulation, can be an appealing avenue toward functional restoration of injured nervous systems. Here, 3D conductive scaffolds are fabricated based on printed microfiber constructs using near&#8208;field electrostatic printing (NFEP) and graphene oxide (GO) coating. Various microfiber patterns are obtained from poly(l&#8208;lactic acid&#8208;co&#8208;caprolactone) (PLCL) using NFEP and complexity is achieved via modulating the fiber overlay angles (45&#176;, 60&#176;, 75&#176;, 90&#176;), fiber diameters (15 to 148&#160;&#181;m), and fiber spatial organization (spider web and tubular structure). Upon coating GO onto PLCL microfibers via a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (L&#8208;b&#8208;L) assembly technique and in situ reduction into reduced GO (rGO), the obtained conductive scaffolds, with 25&#8211;50 layers of rGO, demonstrate superior conductivity (&#8776;0.95 S cm&#8722;1) and capability of inducing neuronal&#8208;like network formation along the conductive microfibers under electrical stimulation (100&#8211;150&#160;mV cm&#8722;1). Both electric field (0&#8211;150&#160;mV cm&#8722;1) and microfiber diameter (17&#8211;150&#160;&#181;m) affect neurite outgrowth (PC&#8208;12 cells and primary mouse hippocampal neurons) and the formation of orientated neuronal&#8208;like networks. With further demonstration of such guidance to neuronal cells, these conductive scaffolds may see versatile applications in nerve regeneration and neural engineering.

      <title>Leveraging mRNA Sequences and Nanoparticles to Deliver SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Antigens In Vivo</title>
      <dc:description>
In the fight against the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 pandemic, mRNA is a promising vaccine candidate. Untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs are systematically engineered and optimized to enhance protein production. Through the use of lipid&#8208;derived nanoparticles, the mRNA vaccines, which are equipped with the optimized UTRs, trigger a dramatic expression of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 antigens and induce potent production of antigen&#8208;specific antibodies in vaccinated mice.








Abstract
SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 has become a pandemic worldwide; therefore, an effective vaccine is urgently needed. Recently, messenger RNAs (mRNAs) have emerged as a promising platform for vaccination. In this work, the untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs are systematically engineered in order to enhance protein production. Through a comprehensive analysis of endogenous gene expression and de novo design of UTRs, the optimal combination of 5&#8242; and 3&#8242; UTR are identified and termed NASAR, which are 5&#8208; to 10&#8208;fold more efficient than the tested endogenous UTRs. More importantly, NASAR mRNAs delivered by lipid&#8208;derived TT3 nanoparticles trigger a dramatic expression of potential SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 antigens. The antigen&#8208;specific antibodies induced by TT3&#8208;nanoparticles and NASAR mRNAs are over two orders of magnitude more than that induced by the FDA&#8208;approved lipid nanoparticle material MC3 in vaccinated mice. These NASAR mRNAs merit further development as alternative SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 vaccines.

In this work, the untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs are systematically engineered in order to enhance protein production. Through a comprehensive analysis of endogenous gene expression and de novo design of UTRs, the optimal combination of 5&#8242; and 3&#8242; UTR are identified and termed NASAR, which are 5&#8208; to 10&#8208;fold more efficient than the tested endogenous UTRs. More importantly, NASAR mRNAs delivered by lipid&#8208;derived TT3 nanoparticles trigger a dramatic expression of potential SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 antigens. The antigen&#8208;specific antibodies induced by TT3&#8208;nanoparticles and NASAR mRNAs are over two orders of magnitude more than that induced by the FDA&#8208;approved lipid nanoparticle material MC3 in vaccinated mice. These NASAR mRNAs merit further development as alternative SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blocking Ion Migration Stabilizes the High Thermoelectric Performance in Cu2Se Composites</title>
      <dc:description>
The space&#8208;charge region between the Cu2Se host matrix and in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed BiCuSeO under a direct current causes drastic suppression of Cu+ ion migration in the composites and obstructs the reduction reaction of Cu+ into Cu metal, which, together with the effective regulation of carrier concentration as well as enhanced interfacial phonon scattering, greatly stabilizes the improved thermoelectric performance.








Abstract
The applications of mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors are limited due to phase instability under a high direct current and large temperature difference. Here, it is shown that Cu2Se is stabilized through regulating the behaviors of Cu+ ions and electrons in a Schottky heterojunction between the Cu2Se host matrix and in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed BiCuSeO nanoparticles. The accumulation of Cu+ ions via an ionic capacitive effect at the Schottky junction under the direct current modifies the space&#8208;charge distribution in the electric double layer, which blocks the long&#8208;range migration of Cu+ and produces a drastic reduction of Cu+ ion migration by nearly two orders of magnitude. Moreover, this heterojunction impedes electrons transferring from BiCuSeO to Cu2Se, obstructing the reduction reaction of Cu+ into Cu metal at the interface and hence stabilizes the &#946;&#8208;Cu2Se phase. Furthermore, incorporation of BiCuSeO in Cu2Se optimizes the carrier concentration and intensifies phonon scattering, contributing to the peak figure of merit ZT value of &#8776;2.7&#160;at 973 K and high average ZT value of &#8776;1.5 between 400 and 973 K for the Cu2Se/BiCuSeO composites. This discovery provides a new avenue for stabilizing mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conduction thermoelectrics, and gives fresh insights into controlling ion migration in these ionic&#8208;transport&#8208;dominated materials.

      <dc:description>
A series of nitrogen&#8208;doped, cross&#8208;coupled micro&#8208;mesoporous carbon&#8211;metal networks are developed as robust additives to 3D printing inks for the fabrication of micro&#8208;supercapacitors (MSCs).

Abstract
The construction of advanced micro&#8208;supercapacitors (MSCs) with both wide working&#8208;voltage and high energy density is promising but still challenging. In this work, a series of nitrogen&#8208;doped, cross&#8208;coupled micro&#8208;mesoporous carbon&#8211;metal networks (N&#8208;STC/MxOy) is developed as robust additives to 3D printing inks for MSCs fabrication. Taking the N&#8208;STC/Fe2O3 nanocomposite as an example, both experimental results and theoretical simulations reveal that the well&#8208;developed hierarchical networks with abundantly decorated ultrafine Fe2O3 nanoparticles not only significantly facilitate the ion adsorption at its three&#8208;phase boundaries (Fe2O3, N&#8208;STC, and electrolyte), but also greatly favor ionic diffusion/transport with shortened pathways. Consequently, the as&#8208;prepared N&#8208;STC/Fe2O3 electrode delivers a high gravimetric capacitance (267 F g&#8722;1 at 2 mV s&#8722;1) and outstanding stability in a liquid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based symmetric device, as well as a record&#8208;high energy density of 114 Wh kg&#8722;1 for an asymmetric supercapacitor. Particularly, the gravimetric capacitance of the ionogel&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state MSCs by 3D printing reaches 377 F g&#8722;1 and the device can operate under a wide temperature range (&#8722;10 to 60 &#176;C).

      <title>Organic Multiferroic Magnetoelastic Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
The spin&#8211;lattice interaction is an intrinsic property of magnetoelastic coupling. In organic ferromagnetic crystals, the deformed crystal lattice changes the saturation magnetization of ferromagnets to exhibit a remarkable magnetoelastic coupling. Moreover, when stimulated by a magnetic field, the lattice of the ferromagnetic crystals shrinks. Organic magnetoelastic coupling is expected to be of great interest for ultrasensitive spin&#8208;mechanical devices.








Abstract
The design of crystal structures aids the discovery of interesting physical phenomena in organic crystals. In this work, the optimization of the coronene&#8211;tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) structure generates non&#8208;degenerate energy levels of spin&#8208;up and spin&#8208;down electrons after charge transfer, producing spontaneous spin polarization, leading to pronounced ferromagnetism. The deformed crystal lattice can significantly affect the saturation magnetization of organic ferromagnets to present a remarkable magnetoelastic coupling. Furthermore, the magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;induced lattice shrinkage of the ferromagnetic crystals supports a spin&#8211;lattice&#8208;interaction&#8208;dependent magnetoelastic coupling. This concept of organic magnetoelastic coupling will pave the way for the rapid mechanical control of spin polarization in organic multiferroic magnetoelastic materials.

      <title>Lattice&#8208;Strain Engineering of Homogeneous NiS0.5Se0.5 Core&#8211;Shell Nanostructure as a Highly Efficient and Robust Electrocatalyst for Overall Water Splitting</title>
      <dc:description>
A series of tunable lattice&#8208;strained NiSxSe1&#8211;x core&#8208;shell electrocatalysts are synthesized by a facile strategy. The generated lattice strain in NiS0.5Se0.5 can decrease the metal d&#8208;orbital overlap and lead to a closer d&#8208;band center toward the Fermi level, thus optimizing the electronic structure and reaction energy barrier for hydrogen and oxygen evolution process, enhancing the overall water splitting performance.








Abstract
Developing highly&#8208;efficient non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal electrocatalysts for water splitting is crucial for the development of clean and reversible hydrogen energy. Introducing lattice strain is an effective strategy to develop efficient electrocatalysts. However, lattice strain is typically co&#8208;created with heterostructure, vacancy, or substrate effects, which complicate the identification of the strain&#8208;activity correlation. Herein, a series of lattice&#8208;strained homogeneous NiSxSe1&#8722;x nanosheets@nanorods hybrids are designed and synthesized by a facile strategy. The NiS0.5Se0.5 with &#8776;2.7% lattice strain exhibits outstanding activity for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER), affording low overpotentials of 70 and 257 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively, as well as excellent long&#8208;term durability even at a large current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2 (300 h), significantly superior to other benchmarks and the precious metal catalysts. Experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the generated lattice strain decreases the metal d&#8208;orbital overlap, leading to a narrower bandwidth and a closer d&#8208;band center toward the Fermi level. Thus, NiS0.5Se0.5 possesses favorable H* adsorption kinetics for HER and lower energy barriers for OER. This work provides a new insight to regulate the lattice strain of advanced catalyst materials and further improve the performance of energy conversion technologies.

      <title>TFT Channel Materials for Display Applications: From Amorphous Silicon to Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance thin&#8208;film&#8208;transistor (TFT) channel materials are essential components in future displays with novel functions and form factors. The basic materials properties and their TFT applications are discussed, focusing mainly on their performance. In addition, other key considerations such as bias&#8208; and light&#8208;stability are also covered.








Abstract
As the need for super&#8208;high&#8208;resolution displays with various form factors has increased, it has become necessary to produce high&#8208;performance thin&#8208;film transistors (TFTs) that enable faster switching and higher current driving of each pixel in the display. Over the past few decades, hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a&#8208;Si:H) has been widely utilized as a TFT channel material. More recently, to meet the requirement of new types of displays such as organic light&#8208;emitting diode displays, and also to overcome the performance and reliability issues of a&#8208;Si:H, low&#8208;temperature polycrystalline silicon and amorphous oxide semiconductors have partly replaced a&#8208;Si:H channel materials. Basic material properties and device structures of TFTs in commercial displays are explored, and then the potential of atomically thin layered transition metal dichalcogenides as next&#8208;generation channel materials is discussed.

      <title>Metamaterials for Enhanced Optical Responses and their Application to Active Control of Terahertz Waves</title>
      <dc:description>
Passive and active metamaterials are important to the development of unconventional terahertz optical devices due to their engineered optical responses, such as enhanced optical responses, electrical control, and spatiotemporal control. These materials are reviewed, with emphasis on metamaterials for engineering of terahertz waves, from the regime of passive devices to broader areas in which functionalized active terahertz devices are particularly required.








Abstract
Metamaterials, artificially constructed structures that mimic lattices in natural materials, have made numerous contributions to the development of unconventional optical devices. With an increasing demand for more diverse functionalities, terahertz (THz) metamaterials are also expanding their domain, from the realm of mere passive devices to the broader area where functionalized active THz devices are particularly required. A brief review on THz metamaterials is given with a focus on research conducted in the authors' group. The first part is centered on enhanced THz optical responses from tightly coupled meta&#8208;atom structures, such as high refractive index, enhanced optical activity, anomalous wavelength scaling, large phase retardation, and nondispersive polarization rotation. Next, electrically gated graphene metamaterials are reviewed with an emphasis on the functionalization of enhanced THz optical responses. Finally, the linear frequency conversion of THz waves in a rapidly time&#8208;variant THz metamaterial is briefly discussed in the more general context of spatiotemporal control of light.

Abstract
One of the key breakthroughs enabling flexible electronics with novel form factors is the deployment of flexible polymer films in place of brittle glass, which is one of the major structural materials for conventional electronic devices. Flexible electronics requires polymer films with the core properties of glass (i.e., dimensional stability and transparency) while retaining the pliability of the polymer, which, however, is fundamentally intractable due to the mutually exclusive nature of these characteristics. An overview of a transparent fiber&#8208;reinforced polymer, which is suggested as a potentially viable structural material for emerging flexible/wearable electronics, is provided. This includes material concept and fabrication and a brief review of recent research progress on its applications over the past decade.

Abstract
Control of magnetization in magnetic nanostructures is essential for development of spintronic devices because it governs fundamental device characteristics such as energy consumption, areal density, and operation speed. In this respect, spin&#8211;orbit torque (SOT), which originates from the spin&#8211;orbit interaction, has been widely investigated due to its efficient manipulation of the magnetization using in&#8208;plane current. SOT spearheads novel spintronic applications including high&#8208;speed magnetic memories, reconfigurable logics, and neuromorphic computing. Herein, recent advances in SOT research, highlighting the considerable benefits and challenges of SOT&#8208;based spintronic devices, are reviewed. First, the materials and structural engineering that enhances SOT efficiency are discussed. Then major experimental results for field&#8208;free SOT switching of perpendicular magnetization are summarized, which includes the introduction of an internal effective magnetic field and the generation of a distinct spin current with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin polarization. Finally, advanced SOT functionalities are presented, focusing on the demonstration of reconfigurable and complementary operation in spin logic devices.

Various approaches to enhance the outcoupling efficiency of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are presented along with a discussion as to what can be done further to realize their ultimate potential. Recent efforts to extend the applications of OLEDs beyond displays are also highlighted. As such examples, OLED&#8208;based health&#8208;monitoring sensors, wearable phototherapeutic patches, and fabric&#8208;like OLEDs are introduced.








Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are established as a mainstream light source for display applications and can now be found in a plethora of consumer electronic devices used daily. This success can be attributed to the rich luminescent properties of organic materials, but efficiency enhancement made over the last few decades has also played a significant role in making OLEDs a practically viable technology. This report summarizes the efforts made so far to improve the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of OLEDs and discusses what should further be done to push toward the ultimate efficiency that can be offered by OLEDs. The study indicates that EQE close to 58% and 80% can be within reach without and with additional light extraction structures, respectively, with an optimal combination of cavity engineering, low&#8208;index transport layers, and horizontal dipole orientation. In addition, recent endeavors to identify possible applications of OLEDs beyond displays are presented with emphasis on their potential in wearable healthcare, such as OLED&#8208;based pulse oximetry as well as phototherapeutic applications based on body&#8208;attachable flexible OLED patches. OLEDs with fabric&#8208;like form factors and washable encapsulation strategies are also introduced as technologies essential to the success of OLED&#8208;based wearable electronics.

      <title>Polydopamine and Its Derivative Surface Chemistry in Material Science: A Focused Review for Studies at KAIST</title>
      <dc:description>
Polydopamine coating, the first material&#8208;independent surface chemistry, and its derivative methods influence nearly all areas of material sciences. Polydopamine chemistry&#8212;material science of four categories (catechol&#8208;containing small molecules, catechol&#8208;tethered polymers, gallol&#8208;containing small molecules, and gallol&#8208;conjugated polymers)&#8212;is discussed in detail.








Abstract
Polydopamine coating, the first material&#8208;independent surface chemistry, and its related methods significantly influence virtually all areas of material science and engineering. Functionalized surfaces of metal oxides, synthetic polymers, noble metals, and carbon materials by polydopamine and its related derivatives exhibit a variety of properties for cell culture, microfluidics, energy storage devices, superwettability, artificial photosynthesis, encapsulation, drug delivery, and numerous others. Unlike other articles, this review particularly focuses on the development of material science utilizing polydopamine and its derivatives coatings at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology for a decade. Herein, it is demonstrated how material&#8208;independent coating methods provide solutions for challenging problems existed in many interdisciplinary areas in bio&#8208;, energy&#8208;, and nanomaterial science by collaborations and independent research.

      <title>Disordered Optics: Exploiting Multiple Light Scattering and Wavefront Shaping for Nonconventional Optical Elements</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent progress on disordered materials is summarized. By exploiting disorder in materials using optical wavefront&#8208;shaping techniques, great potential is shown in enabling functionalities that go beyond their conventional materials, while exhibiting advantages in reduced form factors. Disordered materials will play important roles in both basic physical studies and their application in nanotechnology.








Abstract
Advances in diverse areas such as inspection, imaging, manufacturing, telecommunications, and information processing have been stimulated by novel optical devices. Conventional material ingredients for these devices are typically made of homogeneous refractive or diffractive materials and require sophisticated design and fabrication, which results in practical limitations related to their form and functional figures of merit. To overcome such limitations, recent developments in the application of disordered materials as novel optical elements have indicated great potential in enabling functionalities that go beyond their conventional counterparts, while the materials exhibit potential advantages with respect to reduced form factors. Combined with wavefront shaping, disordered materials enable dynamic transitions between multiple functionalities in a single active optical device. Recent progress in this field is summarized to gain insight into the physical principles behind disordered optics with regard to their advantages in various applications as well as their limitations compared to conventional optics.

      <title>Closest Packing Polymorphism Interfaced Metastable Transition Metal for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>
A closest packing polymorphism interface is constructed between metastable hexagonal&#8208;close&#8208;packed phase and its stable counterpart (face&#8208;centered cubic) in a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalyst, promoting the catalytic activity and long&#8208;term durability towards the alkaline hydrogen evolution process.








Abstract
Metastable materials are promising because of their catalytic properties, high&#8208;energy structure, and unique electronic environment. However, the unstable nature inherited from the metastability hinders further performance improvement and practical applications of these materials. Herein, this limitation is successfully addressed by constructing an in situ polymorphism interface (inf) between the metastable hexagonal&#8208;close&#8208;packed (hcp) phase and its stable counterpart (face&#8208;centered cubic, fcc) in cobalt&#8211;nickel (CoNi) alloy. Calculations reveal that the interfacial synergism derived from the hcp and fcc phases lowers the formation energy and enhances stability. Consequently, the optimized CoNi&#8208;inf exhibits an exceptionally low potential of 72&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 57&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1.0 m KOH. Furthermore, it is superior to most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based HER catalysts. No noticeable activity decay or structural changes are observed even over 14 h of catalysis. The computational simulation further rationalizes that the interface of CoNi&#8208;inf with a suitable d&#8208;band center provides uniform sites for hydrogen adsorption, leading to a distinguished HER catalytic activity. This work, therefore, presents a new route for designing metastable catalysts for potential energy conversion.

      <title>Tuning the Structural and Optoelectronic Properties of Cs2AgBiBr6 Double&#8208;Perovskite Single Crystals through Alkali&#8208;Metal Substitution</title>
      <dc:description>
The search for nontoxic perovskite materials with long&#8208;term stability provides new opportunities for optoelectronics. Alkali&#8208;substituted compounds based on the double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 are scrutinized in terms of their photo&#8208;physical and structural properties. Cation&#8208;substitution entails an enhanced carrier recombination lifetime and, in combination with the tunability in the sensitivity to X&#8208;rays, makes these materials suitable for applications in X&#8208;ray detectors.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;free double perovskites have great potential as stable and nontoxic optoelectronic materials. Recently, Cs2AgBiBr6 has emerged as a promising material, with suboptimal photon&#8208;to&#8208;charge carrier conversion efficiency, yet well suited for high&#8208;energy photon&#8208;detection applications. Here, the optoelectronic and structural properties of pure Cs2AgBiBr6 and alkali&#8208;metal&#8208;substituted (Cs1&#8722;xYx)2AgBiBr6 (Y: Rb+, K+, Na+; x&#160;= 0.02) single crystals are investigated. Strikingly, alkali&#8208;substitution entails a tunability to the material system in its response to X&#8208;rays and structural properties that is most strongly revealed in Rb&#8208;substituted compounds whose X&#8208;ray sensitivity outperforms other double&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based devices reported. While the fundamental nature and magnitude of the bandgap remains unchanged, the alkali&#8208;substituted materials exhibit a threefold boost in their fundamental carrier recombination lifetime at room temperature. Moreover, an enhanced electron&#8211;acoustic phonon scattering is found compared to Cs2AgBiBr6. The study thus paves the way for employing cation substitution to tune the properties of double perovskites toward a new material platform for optoelectronics.

As a result, the additive&#8208;treated perovskite solar cell delivers a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19%.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3 holds promise for efficient tandem solar cells, but reported fabrication techniques are not transferrable to scalable manufacturing methods. Herein, printable CsPbI3 solar cells are reported, in which the charge transporting layers and photoactive layer are deposited by fast blade&#8208;coating at a low temperature (&#8804;100 &#176;C)&#160;in ambient conditions. High&#8208;quality CsPbI3 films are grown via introducing a low concentration of the multifunctional molecular additive Zn(C6F5)2, which reconciles the conflict between air&#8208;flow&#8208;assisted fast drying and low&#8208;quality film including energy misalignment and trap formation. Material analysis reveals a preferential accumulation of the additive close to the perovskite/SnO2 interface and strong chemisorption on the perovskite surface, which leads to the formation of energy gradients and suppressed trap formation within the perovskite film, as well as a 150 meV improvement of the energetic alignment at the perovskite/SnO2 interface. The combined benefits translate into significant enhancement of the power conversion efficiency to 19% for printable solar cells. The devices without encapsulation degrade only by &#8776;2% after 700 h in air conditions.

      <title>Solution&#8208;Processable Pure Green Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter Based on the Multiple Resonance Effect</title>
      <dc:description>
A thermally activated delayed fluorescence material featuring multiple resonance effect of boron, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms (OAB&#8208;ABP&#8208;1) is synthesized by one&#8208;shot double borylation. A solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) device using OAB&#8208;ABP&#8208;1 exhibits pure green electroluminescence with a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum, and a high external quantum efficiency with minimum efficiency roll&#8208;off.








Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials based on the multiple resonance (MR) effect are applied in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), combining high color purity and efficiency. However, they are not fabricated via solution&#8208;processing, which is an economical approach toward the mass production of OLED displays. Here, a solution&#8208;processable MR&#8208;TADF material (OAB&#8208;ABP&#8208;1), with an extended &#960;&#8208;skeleton and bulky substituents, is designed. OAB&#8208;ABP&#8208;1 is synthesized from commercially available starting materials via a four&#8208;step process involving one&#8208;shot double borylation. OAB&#8208;ABP&#8208;1 presents attractive photophysical properties, a narrow emission band, a high photoluminescence quantum yield, a small energy gap between S1 and T1, and low activation energy for reverse intersystem crossing. These properties are attributed to the alternating localization of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals induced by the boron, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms. Furthermore, to facilitate charge recombination, two novel semiconducting polymers with similar ionization potentials to that of OAB&#8208;ABP&#8208;1 are synthesized for use as interlayer and emissive layer materials. A solution&#8208;processed OLED device is fabricated using OAB&#8208;ABP&#8208;1 and the aforementioned polymers; it exhibits pure green electroluminescence with a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum and a high external quantum efficiency with minimum efficiency roll&#8208;off.

      <title>4D&#8208;Printed Transformable Tube Array for High&#8208;Throughput 3D Cell Culture and Histology</title>
      <dc:description>
A 4D&#8208;printed transformable culture tube array (TTA) can directly transfer a large number of 3D culture models from a microwell plate to a histology cassette, enabling rapid and parallel histological analysis. A seamless workflow from cell culture to histological analysis is demonstrated with human neural progenitor cell (hNPC) spheroids cultured in the TTA.








Abstract
3D cell cultures are rapidly emerging as a promising tool to model various human physiologies and pathologies by closely recapitulating key characteristics and functions of in vivo microenvironment. While high&#8208;throughput 3D culture is readily available using multi&#8208;well plates, assessing the internal microstructure of 3D cell cultures still remains extremely slow because of the manual, laborious, and time&#8208;consuming histological procedures. Here, a 4D&#8208;printed transformable tube array (TTA) using a shape&#8208;memory polymer that enables massively parallel histological analysis of 3D cultures is presented. The interconnected TTA can be programmed to be expanded by 3.6 times of its printed dimension to match the size of a multi&#8208;well plate, with the ability to restore its original dimension for transferring all cultures to a histology cassette in order. Being compatible with microtome sectioning, the TTA allows for parallel histology processing for the entire samples cultured in a multi&#8208;well plate. The test result with human neural progenitor cell spheroids suggests a remarkable reduction in histology processing time by an order of magnitude. High&#8208;throughput analysis of 3D cultures enabled by this TTA has great potential to further accelerate innovations in various 3D culture applications such as high&#8208;throughput/content screening, drug discovery, disease modeling, and personalized medicine.

      <title>Biopolymers Derived from Trees as Sustainable Multifunctional Materials: A Review</title>
      <dc:description>
A timely overview of the recent development of materials and structures derived from different parts of trees for sustainability is provided. The relationships between the structure, properties, performance, and applications of components from trees are comprehensively reviewed. A concise introduction of the corresponding chemistry and preparation methods of functional elements from the trees is given.








Abstract
The world is currently transitioning from a fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;driven energy economy to one that is supplied by more renewable and sustainable materials. Trees as the most abundant renewable bioresource have attracted significant attention for advanced materials and manufacturing in this epochal transition. Trees are composed with complex structures and components such as trunk (stem and bark), leaf, flower, seed, and root. Although many excellent reviews have been published regarding advanced applications of wood and wood&#8208;derived biopolymers in different fields, such as energy, electronics, biomedical, and water treatment, no reviews have revisited and systematically discussed functional materials and even devices derived from trees in a full scope yet. Therefore, a timely summary of the recent development of materials and structures derived from different parts of trees for sustainability is prsented here. A concise introduction to the different parts of the trees is given first, which is followed by the corresponding chemistry and preparation of functional materials using various biopolymers from trees. The most promising applications of biopolymer&#8208;based materials are discussed subsequently. A comprehensive review of the different parts of trees as sustainable functional materials and devices for critical applications is thus provided.

      <title>Time&#8208;Resolved Structural Kinetics of an Organic Mixed Ionic&#8211;Electronic Conductor</title>
      <dc:description>
Time&#8208;resolved operando scattering captures the transient microstructural changes of an organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductor in response to dynamic electrochemical potential. The timescales of structural changes related to doping and dedoping are not symmetrical. Combined with spectroelectrochemical measurements, the close relationship between microstructure transients and polaron&#8211;bipolaron population kinetics is revealed.








Abstract
The structure and packing of organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors have an especially significant effect on transport properties. In operating devices, this structure is not fixed but is responsive to changes in electrochemical potential, ion intercalation, and solvent swelling. Toward this end, the steady&#8208;state and transient structure of the model organic mixed conductor, poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), is characterized using multimodal time&#8208;resolved operando techniques. Steady&#8208;state operando X&#8208;ray scattering reveals a doping&#8208;induced lamellar expansion of 1.6 &#197; followed by 0.4 &#197; relaxation at high doping levels. Time&#8208;resolved operando X&#8208;ray scattering reveals asymmetric rates of lamellar structural change during doping and dedoping that do not directly depend on potential or charging transients. Time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy establishes a link between structural transients and the complex kinetics of electronic charge carrier subpopulations, in particular the polaron&#8211;bipolaron equilibrium. These findings provide insight into the factors limiting the response time of organic mixed&#8208;conductor&#8208;based devices, and present the first real&#8208;time observation of the structural changes during doping and dedoping of a conjugated polymer system via X&#8208;ray scattering.

Hydrophilic molybdenum boride (MoB) nanoparticles are prepared through a facile solid&#8208;state reaction and employed as an efficient catalytic additive in sulfur cathodes. Benefiting from the appealing properties of MoB, pouch cells fabricated with the MoB additive deliver an ultrahigh discharge capacity of 947 mA h g&#8722;1 over 55 cycles under practically necessary conditions.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, despite having high theoretical specific energy, possess many practical challenges, including lithium polysulfide (LiPS) shuttling. To address the issues, here, hydrophilic molybdenum boride (MoB) nanoparticles are presented as an efficient catalytic additive for sulfur cathodes. The high conductivity and rich catalytically active sites of MoB nanoparticles allow for a fast kinetics of LiPS redox in high&#8208;sulfur&#8208;loading electrodes (6.1 mg cm&#8722;2). Besides, the hydrophilic properties and good wettability toward electrolyte of MoB can facilitate electrolyte penetration and LiPS redox, guaranteeing a high utilization of sulfur under a lean&#8208;electrolyte condition. Therefore, the cells with MoB achieve impressive electrochemical performance, including a high capacity (1253 mA h g&#8722;1) and ultralong lifespan (1000 cycles) with a low capacity fade rate of 0.03% per cycle. Also, pouch cells fabricated with the MoB additive deliver an ultrahigh discharge capacity of 947 mA h g&#8722;1, corresponding to a low electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;capacity ratio of about 4.8 &#181;L (mA h)&#8722;1, and remain stable over 55 cycles under practically necessary conditions with a low electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;sulfur ratio of 4.5 &#181;L mg&#8722;1.

      <title>Optomechanically Actuated Microcilia for Locally Reconfigurable Surfaces</title>
      <dc:description>
Chromium dioxide/poly(dimethylsiloxane) composite micropillars with high aspect&#8208;ratio and magnetic properties are presented. The microcilia can be remotely actuated either collectively or selectively by using magnetic fields and light. Light&#8208;driven local actuation enables this microcilia array to function as reconfigurable and controllably moving subsets.








Abstract
Artificial microcilia structures have shown potential to incorporate actuators in various applications such as microfluidic devices and biomimetic microrobots. Among the multiple possibilities to achieve cilia actuation, magnetic fields present an opportunity given their quick response and wireless operation, despite the difficulty in achieving localized actuation because of their continuous distribution. In this work, a high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio (&gt;8), elastomeric, magnetically responsive microcilia array is presented that allows for wireless, localized actuation through the combined use of light and magnetic fields. The microcilia array can move in response to an external magnetic field and can be locally actuated by targeted illumination of specific areas. The periodic pattern of the microcilia also diffracts light with varying diffraction efficiency as a function of the applied magnetic field, showing potential for wirelessly controlled adaptive optical elements.

      <title>Particulate Alum via Pickering Emulsion for an Enhanced COVID&#8208;19 Vaccine Adjuvant</title>
      <dc:description>
The adjuvant&#8208;effect of the licensed alum adjuvant by particulate alum via Pickering emulsion (PAPE) is exploited toward enhanced COVID&#8208;19 vaccines. PAPE mirrors and &#8220;inherits&#8221; the acknowledged biosafety profile. Additionally, the alum&#8208;packed interphase confers higher affinity for dendritic cell uptake, which provokes the uptake and cross&#8208;presentation of antigens for potent humoral and cellular responses.








Abstract
For rapid response against the prevailing COVID&#8208;19 (coronavirus disease 19), it is a global imperative to exploit the immunogenicity of existing formulations for safe and efficient vaccines. As the most accessible adjuvant, aluminum hydroxide (alum) is still the sole employed adjuvant in most countries. However, alum tends to attach on the membrane rather than entering the dendritic cells (DCs), leading to the absence of intracellular transfer and process of the antigens, and thus limits T&#8208;cell&#8208;mediated immunity. To address this, alum is packed on the squalene/water interphase is packed, forming an alum&#8208;stabilized Pickering emulsion (PAPE). &#8220;Inheriting&#8221; from alum and squalene, PAPE demonstrates a good biosafety profile. Intriguingly, with the dense array of alum on the oil/water interphase, PAPE not only adsorbs large quantities of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) antigens, but also harbors a higher affinity for DC uptake, which provokes the uptake and cross&#8208;presentation of the delivered antigens. Compared with alum&#8208;treated groups, more than six times higher antigen&#8208;specific antibody titer and three&#8208;fold more IFN&#8208;&#947;&#8208;secreting T cells are induced, indicating the potent humoral and cellular immune activations. Collectively, the data suggest that PAPE may provide potential insights toward a safe and efficient adjuvant platform for the enhanced COVID&#8208;19 vaccinations.

      <title>Structural Approaches to Control Interlayer Interactions in 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>
Some of the effects that the structure of monomers can have on the interlayer interactions in 2D covalent organic frameworks and related materials are presented.








Abstract
The ability to design and synthesize monomers can affect fundamental aspects in 2D covalent organic frameworks, such as dimensionality, topology, and pore size. Besides this, the structure of the monomers can also affect interlayer interactions, which provide an additional means to influence crystallinity, layer arrangement, interlayer distances, and exfoliability. Herein, some of the effects that the structure of monomers can have on the interlayer interactions in 2D covalent organic frameworks and related materials are illustrated.

      <title>An Efficient Approach to Fabricate Air&#8208;Stable Perovskite Solar Cells via Addition of a Self&#8208;Polymerizing Ionic Liquid</title>
      <dc:description>
The inclusion of a novel in situ polymerizable ionic liquid, 1,3&#8208;bis(4&#8208;vinylbenzyl)imidazolium chloride ([bvbim]Cl), allows perovskite films to be manufactured under humid environments, conferring improved materials quality, higher power conversion efficiency, and long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
Despite the excellent photovoltaic properties achieved by perovskite solar cells at the laboratory scale, hybrid perovskites decompose in the presence of air, especially at high temperatures and in humid environments. Consequently, high&#8208;efficiency perovskites are usually prepared in dry/inert environments, which are expensive and less convenient for scale&#8208;up purposes. Here, a new approach based on the inclusion of an in situ polymerizable ionic liquid, 1,3&#8208;bis(4&#8208;vinylbenzyl)imidazolium chloride ([bvbim]Cl), is presented, which allows perovskite films to be manufactured under humid environments, additionally leading to a material with improved quality and long&#8208;term stability. The approach, which is transferrable to several perovskite formulations, allows efficiencies as high as 17% for MAPbI3 processed in air % relative humidity (RH) &#8805;30 (from an initial 15%), and 19.92% for FAMAPbI3 fabricated in %RH &#8805;50 (from an initial 17%), providing one of the best performances to date under similar conditions.

      <title>Engineering Macrophages for Cancer Immunotherapy and Drug Delivery</title>
      <dc:description>
Macrophages play important roles in tumor growth and treatment. Strategies to engineer tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) to combat tumors are summarized as follows: inhibiting macrophage recruitment, depleting TAMs, reprograming TAMs, and blocking the CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; pathway. Furthermore, tumor&#8208;targeting M1 macrophages are used in anti&#8208;cancer drug delivery in three ways: as macrophages, macrophage&#8208;derived exosomes, and macrophage&#8208;coated nanoparticles acting as drug carriers.








Abstract
Macrophages play an important role in cancer development and metastasis. Proinflammatory M1 macrophages can phagocytose tumor cells, while anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 macrophages such as tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) promote tumor growth and invasion. Modulating the tumor immune microenvironment through engineering macrophages is efficacious in tumor therapy. M1 macrophages target cancerous cells and, therefore, can be used as drug carriers for tumor therapy. Herein, the strategies to engineer macrophages for cancer immunotherapy, such as inhibition of macrophage recruitment, depletion of TAMs, reprograming of TAMs, and blocking of the CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; pathway, are discussed. Further, the recent advances in drug delivery using M1 macrophages, macrophage&#8208;derived exosomes, and macrophage&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles are elaborated. Overall, there is still significant room for development in macrophage&#8208;mediated immune modulation and macrophage&#8208;mediated drug delivery, which will further enhance current tumor therapies against various malignant solid tumors, including drug&#8208;resistant tumors and metastatic tumors.

Further, the recent advances in drug delivery using M1 macrophages, macrophage&#8208;derived exosomes, and macrophage&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles are elaborated. Overall, there is still significant room for development in macrophage&#8208;mediated immune modulation and macrophage&#8208;mediated drug delivery, which will further enhance current tumor therapies against various malignant solid tumors, including drug&#8208;resistant tumors and metastatic tumors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Realizing Reduced Imperfections via Quantum Dots Interdiffusion in High Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Introduction of multi&#8208;cation hybrid halide perovskite quantum dots reduces ionic defects at the surface and grain boundaries via a solid&#8208;state interdiffusion process. The enhanced moisture and photostability enable power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 21% to be achieved with more than 90% of its initial PCE retained on exposure to continuous illumination of more than 550 h.








Abstract
Realization of reduced ionic (cationic and anionic) defects at the surface and grain boundaries (GBs) of perovskite films is vital to boost the power conversion efficiency of organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskite (OIHP) solar cells. Although numerous strategies have been developed, effective passivation still remains a great challenge due to the complexity and diversity of these defects. Herein, a solid&#8208;state interdiffusion process using multi&#8208;cation hybrid halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) is introduced as a strategy to heal the ionic defects at the surface and GBs. It is found that the solid&#8208;state interdiffusion process leads to a reduction in OIHP shallow defects. In addition, Cs+ distribution in QDs greatly influences the effectiveness of ionic defect passivation with significant enhancement to all photovoltaic performance characteristics observed on treating the solar cells with Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95PbBr3 (abbreviated as QDs&#8208;Cs5). This enables power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 21% to be achieved with more than 90% of its initial PCE retained on exposure to continuous illumination of more than 550 h.

      <title>Colloidal Nanosurfactants for 3D Conformal Printing of 2D van der Waals Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanosurfactant&#8208;stabilized 2D material inks are printed conformally on various 2D/3D substrates enabling rapid fabrication of complex device structures with high spatial resolution. Specifically, graphene quantum dot nanosurfactants not only provide electrostatic stabilization for a wide range of 2D materials, but also have become an integrated part of printed devices and result in superior mechanical/optoelectronic properties in 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Printing techniques using nanomaterials have emerged as a versatile tool for fast prototyping and potentially large&#8208;scale manufacturing of functional devices. Surfactants play a significant role in many printing processes due to their ability to reduce interfacial tension between ink solvents and nanoparticles and thus improve ink colloidal stability. Here, a colloidal graphene quantum dot (GQD)&#8208;based nanosurfactant is reported to stabilize various types of 2D materials in aqueous inks. In particular, a graphene ink with superior colloidal stability is demonstrated by GQD nanosurfactants via the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interaction, leading to the printing of multiple high&#8208;resolution patterns on various substrates using a single printing pass. It is found that nanosurfactants can significantly improve the mechanical stability of the printed graphene films compared with those of conventional molecular surfactant, as evidenced by 100 taping, 100 scratching, and 1000 bending cycles. Additionally, the printed composite film exhibits improved photoconductance using UV light with 400 nm wavelength, arising from excitation across the nanosurfactant bandgap. Taking advantage of the 3D conformal aerosol jet printing technique, a series of UV sensors of heterogeneous structures are directly printed on 2D flat and 3D spherical substrates, demonstrating the potential of manufacturing geometrically versatile devices based on nanosurfactant inks.

      <title>Transparent and Freestanding Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotube Films Synthesized Directly and Continuously via a Blown Aerosol Technique</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel blown aerosol chemical vapor deposition (BACVD) method is reported to continuously produce single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) transparent conductive films (TCFs) at a rate of several hundred meters per hour. With BACVD, both carbon conversion efficiency and SWCNT TCF yield can reach three orders of magnitude higher than those with conventional floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition.








Abstract
Single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) films are promising materials as flexible transparent conductive films (TCFs). Here, inspired by the extrusion blown plastic film technique and the SWCNT synthesis approach by floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition (FCCVD), a novel blown aerosol chemical vapor deposition (BACVD) method is reported to directly and continuously produce freestanding SWCNT TCFs at several hundred meters per hour. The synthesis mechanism, involving blowing a stable aerosol bubble and transforming the bubble into an aerogel, is investigated, and a general phase diagram is established for this method. For the SWCNT TCFs via BACVD, both carbon conversion efficiency and SWCNT TCF yield can reach three orders of magnitude higher than those with the conventional FCCVD. The film displays a sheet resistance of 40&#160;ohm&#160;sq&#8722;1 at 90% transmittance after being doped, representing the record performance based on large&#8208;scale SWCNT films. Transparent, flexible, and stretchable electrodes based on BACVD films are demonstrated. Moreover, this high&#8208;throughput method of producing SWCNT TCFs can be compatible with the roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll process for mass production of flexible displays, touch screens, solar cells, and solid&#8208;state lighting, and is expected to have a broad and long&#8208;term impact on many fields from consumer electronics to energy conversion and generation.

      <title>MoS2/Polymer Heterostructures Enabling Stable Resistive Switching and Multistate Randomness</title>
      <dc:description>
MoS2/polymer heterostructure&#8208;based resistive switching devices are demonstrated. These devices show much improved switching performance, such as low set/reset voltage, high on/off ratio, and device stability during cycle to cycle operation, and thus enable potential applications on random number generation for enhanced cybersecurity.








Abstract
Resistive random&#8208;access memories (ReRAMs) based on transition metal dichalcogenide layers are promising physical sources for random number generation (RNG). However, most ReRAM devices undergo performance degradation from cycle to cycle, which makes preserving a normal probability distribution during operation a challenging task. Here, ReRAM devices with excellent stability are reported by using a MoS2/polymer heterostructure as active layer. The stability enhancement manifests in outstanding cumulative probabilities for both high&#8208; and low&#8208;resistivity states of the memory cells. Moreover, the intrinsic values of the high&#8208;resistivity state are found to be an excellent source of randomness as suggested by a Chi&#8208;square test. It is demonstrated that one of these cells alone can generate ten distinct random states, in contrast to the four conventional binary cells that would be required for an equivalent number of states. This work unravels a scalable interface engineering process for the production of high&#8208;performance ReRAM devices, and sheds light on their promising application as reliable RNGs for enhanced cybersecurity in the big data era.

      <title>Multistate Switching of Photonic Angular Momentum Coupling in Phase&#8208;Change Metadevices</title>
      <dc:description>
Multistate switching of photonic angular momentum coupling, namely, symmetric, asymmetric, and no coupling, is experimentally demonstrated at different crystallization levels of structured GST. In practical applications, coded information can be encrypted in asymmetric mode using the spin degree of freedom, while revealing misleading one without proper phase change or after excessive crystallinity.








Abstract
The coupling between photonic spin and orbital angular momenta is significantly enhanced at the subwavelength scale and has found a plethora of applications in nanophotonics. However, it is still a great challenge to make such kind of coupling tunable with multiple sates. Here, a versatile metasurface platform based on polyatomic phase&#8208;change resonators is provided to realize multiple&#8208;state switching of photonic angular momentum coupling. As a proof of concept, three coupling modes, namely, symmetric coupling, asymmetric coupling, and no coupling, are experimentally demonstrated at three different crystallization levels of structured Ge2Sb2Te5 alloy. In practical applications, coded information can be encrypted in asymmetric mode using the spin degree of freedom, while revealing misleading one without proper phase change or after excessive crystallinity. With these findings, this study may open an exciting direction for subwavelength electromagnetics with unprecedented compactness, allowing to envision applications in active nanophotonics and information security engineering.

These supramolecular materials have tough mechanical properties, rapid self&#8208;healing properties, and recyclable properties.








Abstract
The host&#8211;guest interaction as noncovalent bonds can make polymeric materials tough and flexible based on the reversibility property, which is a promising approach to extend the lifetime of polymeric materials. Supramolecular materials with cyclodextrin and adamantane are prepared by mixing host polymers and guest polymers by planetary ball milling. The toughness of the supramolecular materials prepared by ball milling is approximately 2 to 5 times higher than that of supramolecular materials prepared by casting, which is the conventional method. The materials maintain their mechanical properties during repeated ball milling treatments. They are also applicable as self&#8208;healable bulk materials and coatings, and they retain the transparency of the substrate. Moreover, fractured pieces of the materials can be re&#8208;adhered within 10 min. Dynamic mechanical analysis, thermal property measurements, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, and microscopy observations reveal these behaviors in detail. Scars formed on the coating disappear within a few seconds at 60&#160;&#176;C. At the same time, the coating shows scratch resistance due to its good mechanical properties. The ball milling method mixes the host polymer and guest polymer at the nano level to achieve the self&#8208;healing and recycling properties.

      <title>Spin Wave Excitation, Detection, and Utilization in the Organic&#8208;Based Magnet, V(TCNE)x (TCNE = Tetracyanoethylene)</title>
      <dc:description>
Excited coherent and non&#8208;coherent spin waves in organic&#8208;based magnet [V(TCNE)x; TCNE = tetracyanoethylene; x &#8776; 2] can be respectively achieved by microwave and thermal means and this can be transformed into electric energy via the inverse spin Hall effect, in which the efficiency can be modulated by different spin wave modes.








Abstract
Spin waves, quantized as magnons, have low energy loss and magnetic damping, which are critical for devices based on spin&#8208;wave propagation needed for information processing devices. The organic&#8208;based magnet [V(TCNE)x; TCNE = tetracyanoethylene; x &#8776; 2] has shown an extremely low magnetic damping comparable to, for example, yttrium iron garnet (YIG). The excitation, detection, and utilization of coherent and non&#8208;coherent spin waves on various modes in V(TCNE)x is demonstrated and show that the angular momentum carried by microwave&#8208;excited coherent spin waves in a V(TCNE)x film can be transferred into an adjacent Pt layer via spin pumping and detected using the inverse spin Hall effect. The spin pumping efficiency can be tuned by choosing different excited spin wave modes in the V(TCNE)x film. In addition, it is shown that non&#8208;coherent spin waves in a V(TCNE)x film, excited thermally via the spin Seebeck effect, can also be used as spin pumping source that generates an electrical signal in Pt with a sign change in accordance with the magnetization switching of the V(TCNE)x. Combining coherent and non&#8208;coherent spin wave detection, the spin pumping efficiency can be thermally controlled, and new insight is gained for the spintronic applications of spin wave modes in organic&#8208;based magnets.

      <title>NiCo2O4&#8208;Based Nanosheets with Uniform 4 nm Mesopores for Excellent Zn&#8211;Air Battery Performance</title>
      <dc:description>
Optimized NiCo2.148O4 mesoporous nanosheets with an average Co valence state of 2.3 and uniform 4 nm mesopores demonstrate exceptional performance for Zn&#8211;air batteries under a wide temperature range from 80 to &#8722;35 &#176;C, which arises from the high activities of electron exchange and transfer by the surface lower&#8208;coordinated Co&#8208;sites within the porous region.








Abstract
Herein, a strategy is reported for the fabrication of NiCo2O4&#8208;based mesoporous nanosheets (PNSs) with tunable cobalt valence states and oxygen vacancies. The optimized NiCo2.148O4 PNSs with an average Co valence state of 2.3 and uniform 4 nm nanopores present excellent catalytic performance with an ultralow overpotential of 190 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability (700 h) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. Furthermore, Zn&#8211;air batteries built using the NiCo2.148O4 PNSs present a high power and energy density of 83 mW cm&#8722;2 and 910 Wh kg&#8722;1, respectively. Moreover, a portable battery box with NiCo2.148O4 PNSs as the air cathode presents long&#8208;term stability for 120 h under low temperatures in the range of 0 to &#8722;35 &#176;C. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the prominent electron exchange and transfer activity of the electrocatalyst is attributed to the surface lower&#8208;coordinated Co&#8208;sites in the porous region presenting a merging 3d&#8211;eg&#8211;t2g band, which overlaps with the Fermi level of the Zn&#8211;air battery system. This favors the adsorption of the *OH, and stabilized *O radicals are reached, toward competitively lower overpotential, demonstrating a generalized key for optimally boosting overall OER performance.

      <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Organic Solar Cells with High Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage of 1.3 V and Low Non&#8208;Radiative Voltage Loss of 0.16 V</title>
      <dc:description>
The relatively large non&#8208;radiative recombination voltage loss (&#916;Vnon&#8208;rad) is the main challenge for the development of organic solar cells (OSCs). &#916;Vnon&#8208;rad of OSCs can be effectively reduced to 0.16 V by adopting material combinations that deliver high ECT (the energy of charge&#8208;transfer state) and low &#916;ECT (energetic difference between singlet excited state and CT state), together with chlorination in donors.








Abstract
Compared with inorganic or perovskite solar cells, the relatively large non&#8208;radiative recombination voltage losses (&#916;Vnon&#8208;rad) in organic solar cells (OSCs) limit the improvement of the open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc). Herein, OSCs are fabricated by adopting two pairs of D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A polymers (PBT1&#8208;C/PBT1&#8208;C&#8208;2Cl and PBDB&#8208;T/PBDB&#8208;T&#8208;2Cl) as electron donors and a wide&#8208;bandgap molecule BTA3 as the electron acceptor. In these blends, a charge&#8208;transfer state energy (ECT) as high as 1.70&#8211;1.76 eV is achieved, leading to small energetic differences between the singlet excited states and charge&#8208;transfer states (&#916;ECT &#8776; 0.1 eV). In addition, after introducing chlorine atoms into the &#960;&#8208;bridge or the side chain of benzodithiophene (BDT) unit, electroluminescence external quantum efficiencies as high as 1.9 &#215; 10&#8722;3 and 1.0 &#215; 10&#8722;3 are realized in OSCs based on PBTI&#8208;C&#8208;2Cl and PBDB&#8208;T&#8208;2Cl, respectively. Their corresponding &#916;Vnon&#8208;rad are 0.16 and 0.17 V, which are lower than those of OSCs based on the analog polymers without a chlorine atom (0.21 and 0.24 V for PBT1&#8208;C and PBDB&#8208;T, respectively), resulting in high Voc of 1.3 V. The &#916;Vnon&#8208;rad of 0.16 V and Voc of 1.3 V achieved in PBT1&#8208;C&#8208;2Cl:BTA3 OSCs are thought to represent the best values for solution&#8208;processed OSCs reported in the literature so far.

      <title>Toward Rapid&#8208;Charging Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries using Hybrid&#8208;Phase Molybdenum Sulfide Selenide&#8208;Based Anodes</title>
      <dc:description>
Innovatively, a hybrid 1T/2H phase is constructed by the synergistic effect of dual&#8208;anions in MoSSe. Superior ionic/electrical conductivities can be attained due to the hybrid phase and rGO composite. Meanwhile, the stable structure for Na+ storage is ascribed to the enlarged layer spacing and remarkable pseudocapacitive effect. The strong interactions between Mo&#63743;S and Mo&#63743;Se bonds can effectively limit the dissolution of S/Se electrodes.








Abstract
To attain both high energy density and power density in sodium&#8208;ion (Na+) batteries, the reaction kinetics and structural stability of anodes should be improved by materials optimization. In this work, few&#8208;layered molybdenum sulfide selenide (MoSSe) consisting of a mixture of 1T and 2H phases is designed to provide high ionic/electrical conductivities, low Na+ diffusion barrier, and stable Na+ storage. Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is used as a conductive matrix to form 3D electron transfer paths. The resulting MoSSe@rGO anode exhibits high capacity and rate performance in both organic and solid&#8208;state electrolytes. The ultrafast Na+ storage kinetics of the MoSSe@rGO anode is attributed to the surface&#8208;dominant reaction process and broad Na+ channels. In situ and ex situ measurements are conducted to reveal the Na+ storage process in MoSSe@rGO. It is found that the Mo&#63743;S and Mo&#63743;Se bonds effectively limit the dissolution of the active materials. The favorable Na+ storage kinetics of the MoSSe@rGO electrode are ascribed to its low adsorption energy of &#8722;1.997&#160;eV and low diffusion barrier of 0.087&#160;eV. These results reveal that anion doping of metal sulfides is a feasible strategy to develop sodium&#8208;ion batteries with high energy and power densities and long life&#8208;span.

     alt="Toward Rapid&#8208;Charging Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries using Hybrid&#8208;Phase Molybdenum Sulfide Selenide&#8208;Based Anodes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovatively, a hybrid 1T/2H phase is constructed by the synergistic effect of dual&#8208;anions in MoSSe. Superior ionic/electrical conductivities can be attained due to the hybrid phase and rGO composite. Meanwhile, the stable structure for Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; storage is ascribed to the enlarged layer spacing and remarkable pseudocapacitive effect. The strong interactions between Mo&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;S and Mo&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;Se bonds can effectively limit the dissolution of S/Se electrodes.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To attain both high energy density and power density in sodium&#8208;ion (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) batteries, the reaction kinetics and structural stability of anodes should be improved by materials optimization. In this work, few&#8208;layered molybdenum sulfide selenide (MoSSe) consisting of a mixture of 1T and 2H phases is designed to provide high ionic/electrical conductivities, low Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion barrier, and stable Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; storage. Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is used as a conductive matrix to form 3D electron transfer paths. The resulting MoSSe@rGO anode exhibits high capacity and rate performance in both organic and solid&#8208;state electrolytes. The ultrafast Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; storage kinetics of the MoSSe@rGO anode is attributed to the surface&#8208;dominant reaction process and broad Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. In situ and ex situ measurements are conducted to reveal the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; storage process in MoSSe@rGO. It is found that the Mo&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;S and Mo&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;Se bonds effectively limit the dissolution of the active materials. The favorable Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; storage kinetics of the MoSSe@rGO electrode are ascribed to its low adsorption energy of &#8722;1.997&#160;eV and low diffusion barrier of 0.087&#160;eV. These results reveal that anion doping of metal sulfides is a feasible strategy to develop sodium&#8208;ion batteries with high energy and power densities and long life&#8208;span.&lt;/p&gt;
