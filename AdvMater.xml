         <title>Assembly of AIEgen&#8208;Based Fluorescent Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheets and Seaweed Cellulose Nanofibrils for Humidity Sensing and UV&#8208;Shielding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seaweed cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs)&#8208;based composites, with strong fluorescence emission sensitive to relative humidity, are fabricated by integrating 4.0 wt% aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission luminogen (AIEgen)&#8208;based 2D metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanosheets in a water suspension. The composite films also show efficient UV&#8208;shielding capacity without compromise of the optical transmittance and excellent mechanical properties, owing to the metal&#8211;carboxylate coordination between the 2D MOF nanosheets and the CNFs.








Abstract
Integrating synthetic low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials such as metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanosheets with a sustainable biopolymer is a promising strategy to endow composites with attractive structural and functional properties for expanded applications. Herein, aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission luminogen (AIEgen)&#8208;based MOF bulk crystals are successfully exfoliated into ultrathin 2D nanosheets. Seaweed cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) are assembled with low amounts (0.3 to 4.0&#160;wt%) of the 2D nanosheets to generate luminescent composites. The 2D nanosheets are adsorbed onto the CNFs in dilute water suspensions owing to the flexibility of the MOF nanosheets and the high aspect ratio of the CNFs. Transparent films are prepared by solution casting from a water suspension of the CNF&#8208;MOF assembly. The fluorescence emission of the composite films is enhanced because of the favored affinity between MOF nanosheets and CNFs. Remarkably, these films demonstrate excellent UV&#8208;shielding capacity and high optical transmittance at the visible wavelength range. The composite films also show reversible changes in fluorescence emission intensity in response to ambient humidity. The tensile strength and modulus of the composite films are also enhanced owing to the increased adhesion between CNFs through the adsorbed MOF nanosheets. This work provides a novel pathway to fabricate luminescent CNFs&#8208;based composites with tunable optical properties for functional materials.

         <title>Simultaneous One&#8208;Pot Interpenetrating Network Formation to Expand 3D Processing Capabilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot photoinitiated reaction strategy is utilized to create tough interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) hydrogels that are amenable to processing modalities such as Digital Light Processing based 3D printing and microfluidic fabrication of microparticles. The mechanical properties of these IPN hydrogels are highly tunable with optimal formulations exhibiting high toughness and low hysteresis despite the high water content.








Abstract
The incorporation of a secondary network into traditional single&#8208;network hydrogels can enhance mechanical properties, such as toughness and loading to failure. These features are important for many applications, including as biomedical materials; however, the processing of interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) hydrogels is often limited by their multistep fabrication procedures. Here, a one&#8208;pot scheme for the synthesis of biopolymer IPN hydrogels mediated by the simultaneous crosslinking of two independent networks with light, namely: i) free&#8208;radical crosslinking of methacrylate&#8208;modified hyaluronic acid (HA) to form the primary network and ii) thiol&#8211;ene crosslinking of norbornene&#8208;modified HA with thiolated guest&#8211;host assemblies of adamantane and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin to form the secondary network, is reported. The mechanical properties of the IPN hydrogels are tuned by changing the network composition, with high water content (&#8776;94%) hydrogels exhibiting excellent work of fracture, tensile strength, and low hysteresis. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the IPN hydrogels are implemented as low&#8208;viscosity Digital Light Processing resins to fabricate complex structures that recover shape upon loading, as well as in microfluidic devices to form deformable microparticles. Further, the IPNs are cytocompatible with cell adhesion dependent on the inclusion of adhesive peptides. Overall, the enhanced processing of these IPN hydrogels will expand their utility across applications.

         <title>Achieving Ultrahigh&#8208;Rate Planar and Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Electroplating for Aqueous Zinc Battery Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc&#8208;metal anodes, which are desirable for various aqueous zinc battery chemistries, degrade over repeated cycling due to dendrite growth. It is found that dendrites can be prevented by ensuring no defective regions form during zinc deposition, thus removing sites for dendrite nucleation and ensuring purely planar deposition. This allows unprecedentedly high charging rates to be achieved.








Abstract
Despite being one of the most promising candidates for grid&#8208;level energy storage, practical aqueous zinc batteries are limited by dendrite formation, which leads to significantly compromised safety and cycling performance. In this study, by using single&#8208;crystal Zn&#8208;metal anodes, reversible electrodeposition of planar Zn with a high capacity of 8 mAh cm&#8722;2 can be achieved at an unprecedentedly high current density of 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This dendrite&#8208;free electrode is well maintained even after prolonged cycling (&gt;1200 cycles at 50 mA cm&#8722;2). Such excellent electrochemical performance is due to single&#8208;crystal Zn suppressing the major sources of defect generation during electroplating and heavily favoring planar deposition morphologies. As so few defect sites form, including those that would normally be found along grain boundaries or to accommodate lattice mismatch, there is little opportunity for dendritic structures to nucleate, even under extreme plating rates. This scarcity of defects is in part due to perfect atomic&#8208;stitching between merging Zn islands, ensuring no defective shallow&#8208;angle grain boundaries are formed and thus removing a significant source of non&#8208;planar Zn nucleation. It is demonstrated that an ideal high&#8208;rate Zn anode should offer perfect lattice matching as this facilitates planar epitaxial Zn growth and minimizes the formation of any defective regions.

         <title>Confined Assembly of Colloidal Nanorod Superstructures by Locally Controlling Free&#8208;Volume Entropy in Nonequilibrium Fluids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Confined assembly of colloidal nanorods is achieved by locally controlling free&#8208;volume entropy near the three&#8208;phase contact line and optimized self&#8208;assembly thermodynamic conditions. By designing the shape of liquid bridge, nanorod&#8208;superstructure microassembly arrays with long&#8208;range order and designable geometry are fabricated, including microwires, microrings, and orthogonal&#8208;oriented patterns, which exhibit programmable polarized fluorescence emission and polarization&#8208;dependent photoresponse.








Abstract
Long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered structures of nanoparticles with controllable orientation have advantages in applications toward sensors, photoelectric conversion, and field&#8208;effect transistors. The assembly process of nanorods in colloidal systems undergoes a nonequilibrium process from dispersion to aggregation. A variety of assembly methods such as solvent volatilization, electromagnetic field induction, and photoinduction are restricted to suppress local perturbations during the nonequilibrium concentration of nanoparticles, which are adverse to controlling the orientation and order of assembled structures. Here, a confined assembly method is reported by locally controlling free&#8208;volume entropy in nonequilibrium fluids to fabricate microstructure arrays based on colloidal nanorods with controllable orientation and long&#8208;range order. The unique fluid dynamics of the liquid bridge is utilized to form a local region, where the free volume entropy reduction triggers assembly near the three&#8208;phase contact line (TPCL), allowing nanorods to assemble in 2D closest packing parallel to the TPCL for the maximum Gibbs free energy reduction. By manipulating the orientation of liquid flow, microstructures are assembled with programmable geometry, which sustains polarized photoluminescence and polarization&#8208;dependent photodetection. This confined assembly method opens up perspectives on assemblies of nanomaterials with controllable orientation and long&#8208;range order as a platform for multifunctional integrated devices.

         <title>Controlled Doping of Electrocatalysts through Engineering Impurities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of ab&#160;initio calculations and atom probe tomography is used to evidence and rationalize B&#8208;doping of Pd nanocatalysts. The doping level is adjusted by controlling the wet&#8208;chemical synthesis conditions, that is, chemical potential and kinetics. Using this &#8220;impurity engineering&#8221; approach, an influence of B&#8208;doping on the electrocatalytic behavior toward the hydrogen&#8208;oxidation reaction in alkaline conditions is demonstrated.








Abstract
Fuel cells recombine water from H2 and O2 thereby can power, for example, cars or houses with no direct carbon emission. In anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), to reach high power densities, operating at high pH is an alternative to using large volumes of noble metals catalysts at the cathode, where the oxygen&#8208;reduction reaction occurs. However, the sluggish kinetics of the hydrogen&#8208;oxidation reaction (HOR) hinders upscaling despite promising catalysts. Here, the authors observe an unexpected ingress of B into Pd nanocatalysts synthesized by wet&#8208;chemistry, gaining control over this B&#8208;doping, and report on its influence on the HOR activity in alkaline conditions. They rationalize their findings using ab&#160;initio calculations of both H&#8208; and OH&#8208;adsorption on B&#8208;doped Pd. Using this &#8220;impurity engineering&#8221; approach, they thus design Pt&#8208;free catalysts as required in electrochemical energy conversion devices, for example, next generations of AEMFCs, that satisfy the economic and environmental constraints, that is, reasonable operating costs and long&#8208;term stability, to enable the &#8220;hydrogen economy.&#8221;

         <title>A Lysosome&#8208;Activated Tetrahedral Nanobox for Encapsulated siRNA Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetrahedral nanobox, a kind of dynamic framework nucleic acid nanocarrier, is fabricated to completely encapsulate target siRNA and realize controllable delivery of cargo strands upon a pH&#8208;responsive switch. Based on the protective encapsulation against degradation and detachment during delivery and final active release in cells, excellent gene&#8208;silencing effects are achieved for in vitro and in vivo experiments.








Abstract
Tetrahedral framework nucleic acids (tFNAs) have attracted extensive attention as drug nanocarriers because of their excellent cellular uptake. However, for oligonucleotide cargos, tFNA mainly acts as a static delivery platform generated via sticky&#8208;ended ligation. Here, inspired by the original stable space inside the tetrahedral scaffold, a dynamic lysosome&#8208;activated tFNA nanobox is fabricated for completely encapsulating a short interfering RNA (siRNA) of interest. The closed tetrahedral structure endows cargo siRNA with greater resistance against RNase and serum and enables solid integration with the vehicle during delivery. Moreover, the pH&#8208;responsive switch of nanobox allows the controlled release of siRNA upon entry into lysosomes at cell culture temperature. Based on protective loading and active unloading, an excellent silencing effect on the target tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#945;) gene is achieved in in vitro and in vivo experiments. Conclusively, the nanobox offers a dynamic pH&#8208;sensitive confinement delivery system for siRNA and can be an extendable strategy for other small RNA.

         <title>Tailoring Ultrafast and High&#8208;Capacity Sodium Storage via Binding&#8208;Energy&#8208;Driven Atomic Scissors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ge metal with remarkable alloying ability is utilized as novel chemical scissors to controllably reconstruct Ge&#63743;S bonds in the sulfide matrix to fabricate a new GeTiS3 compound. The integrated alloying&#8208;conversion and surface&#8208;dominated redox reactions with enhanced capacitive contribution enable high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;capacity sodium storage.








Abstract
Controllably tailoring alloying anode materials to achieve fast charging and enhanced structural stability is crucial for sodium&#8208;ion batteries with high rate and high capacity performance, yet remains a significant challenge owing to the huge volume change and sluggish sodiation kinetics. Here, a chemical tailoring tool is proposed and developed by atomically dispersing high&#8208;capacity Ge metal into the rigid and conductive sulfide framework for controllable reconstruction of Ge&#63743;S bonds to synergistically realize high capacity and high rate performance for sodium storage. The integrated GeTiS3 material with stable Ti&#8211;S framework and weak Ge&#63743;S bonding delivers high specific capacities of 678 mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.3 C over 100 cycles and 209 mA h g&#8722;1 at 32 C over 10&#160;000 cycles, outperforming most of the reported alloying type anode materials for sodium storage. Interestingly, in situ Raman, X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), and ex situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterizations reveal the formation of well&#8208;dispersed NaxGe confined in the rigid Ti&#8211;S matrix with suppressed volume change after discharge. The synergistically coupled alloying&#8208;conversion and surface&#8208;dominated redox reactions with enhanced capacitive contribution and high reaction reversibility by a binding&#8208;energy&#8208;driven atomic scissors method would break new ground on designing a high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;capacity sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>A Protein&#8208;Like Nanogel for Spinning Hierarchically Structured Artificial Spider Silk</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fiber is draw&#8208;spun from a soluble and crosslinked nanogel, and exhibits spider&#8208;silk&#8208;like hierarchical structures containing cross&#8208;links, aligned nanoassemblies, and sheath&#8211;core structures. Introducing nucleation seeds, prestretch, and a spiral architecture in the nanogel fiber further tunes the alignment and assembly of the polymer chains, and enhances the breaking strength (1.27 GPa) and toughness (383 MJ m&#8722;3).








Abstract
Spider dragline silk is draw&#8208;spun from soluble, &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;crosslinked spidroin in aqueous solution. This spider silk has an excellent combination of strength and toughness, which originates from the hierarchical structure containing &#946;&#8208;sheet crosslinking points, spiral nanoassemblies, a rigid sheath, and a soft core. Inspired by the spidroin structure and spider spinning process, a soluble and crosslinked nanogel is prepared and crosslinked fibers are drew spun with spider&#8208;silk&#8208;like hierarchical structures containing cross&#8208;links, aligned nanoassemblies, and sheath&#8211;core structures. Introducing nucleation seeds in the nanogel solution, and applying prestretch and a spiral architecture in the nanogel fiber, further tunes the alignment and assembly of the polymer chains, and enhances the breaking strength (1.27&#160;GPa) and toughness (383&#160;MJ m&#8722;3) to approach those of the best dragline silk. Theoretical modeling provides understanding for the dependence of the fiber's spinning capacity on the nanogel size. This work provides a new strategy for the direct spinning of tough fiber materials.

         <title>Printable and Highly Stretchable Viscoelastic Conductors with Kinematically Reconstructed Conductive Pathways</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stretch&#8208;induced kinematic reorganization of Ag flakes in a viscoelastic polymer matrix can lead to spontaneous formation of new and efficient conductive pathways with enhanced conductivity, successfully addressing the conductivity&#8211;stretchability dilemma. This study establishes a fundamentally new approach to fabricate filler&#8208;reinforced stretchable conductors, paving the way for the future development of polymer composites for soft, stretchable electronics.








Abstract
Printable and stretchable conductors based on metallic&#8208;filler&#8208;reinforced polymer composites that can maintain high electrical conductivity at large strains are essential for emerging applications in wearable electronics, soft robotics, and bio&#8208;integrated devices. Regulating microstructures of conductive fillers during mechanical deformations is the key to reconstructing the conductive pathway and retaining high electrical conductivity, which has proven to be challenging. Here, it is reported that Ag flakes can spontaneously reorganize inside a viscoelastic, liquid&#8208;like polymer matrix by cyclic mechanical stretching, resulting in reconstructed microstructures and forming highly efficient and stable conductive pathways. Consequently, the electrical conductivities of the resultant composites can be dramatically enhanced by &#8776;4&#8211;8 orders of magnitude and reach &#8776;104 S cm&#8722;1. The stretch&#8208;induced kinematic movements of Ag flakes inside the polymer matrix, together with the reorganization and stabilization mechanisms, are unraveled and validated by the dissipative particle dynamics simulations. This unique phenomenon enables high&#8208;performance stretchable conductors to be fabricated with significantly reduced conductive fillers. The printable and stretchable composites presented here hold great promise for use in soft and stretchable electronics, as demonstrated in stretchable light&#8208;emitting diode arrays and wearable electronics.

The stretch-induced kinematic movements of Ag flakes inside the polymer matrix, together with the reorganization and stabilization mechanisms, are unraveled and validated by the dissipative particle dynamics simulations. This unique phenomenon enables high-performance stretchable conductors to be fabricated with significantly reduced conductive fillers. The printable and stretchable composites presented here hold great promise for use in soft and stretchable electronics, as demonstrated in stretchable light-emitting diode arrays and wearable electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Slip&#8208;Line&#8208;Guided Growth of Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Slip lines on metal surfaces are found to play a pivotal role in determining the orientation of graphene. The slip&#8208;line&#8208;guided growth principle is established to explain and predict the orientation of graphene grown on a variety of metal facets, further enabling the controllable synthesis of single&#8208;crystal graphene and grain&#8208;boundary engineering of bicrystal graphene on designed metal facets.








Abstract
Manipulating the crystal orientation of emerging 2D materials via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a key premise for obtaining single&#8208;crystalline films and designing specific grain&#8208;boundary (GB) structures. Herein, the controllable crystal orientation of graphene during the CVD process is demonstrated on a single&#8208;crystal metal surface with preexisting atomic&#8208;scale stair steps resulting from dislocation slip lines. The slip&#8208;line&#8208;guided growth principle is established to explain and predict the crystal orientation distribution of graphene on a variety of metal facets, especially for the multidirectional growth cases on Cu(hk0) and Cu(hkl) substrates. Not only large&#8208;area single&#8208;crystal graphene, but also bicrystal graphene with controllable GB misorientations, are successfully synthesized by rationally employing tailored metal substrate facets. As a demonstration, bicrystal graphenes with misorientations of &#8776;21&#176; and &#8776;11&#176; are constructed on Cu(410) and Cu(430) foils, respectively. This guideline builds a bridge linking the crystal orientation of graphene and the substrate facet, thereby opening a new avenue for constructing bicrystals with the desired GB structures or manipulating 2D superlattice twist angles in a bottom&#8208;up manner.

         <title>Stable Solid Electrolyte Interphase In&#8208;situ Formed on Magnesium Metal Anode by Using a Perfluorinated Alkoxide&#8208;based All&#8208;magnesium Salt Electrolyte</title>

Abstract
Passivation of Mg anode surface in conventional electrolytes composes a critical issue for practical Mg batteries. In this work, a perfluorinated tert&#8208;butoxide magnesium salt, Mg(pftb)2, is co&#8208;dissolved with MgCl2 in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to form an all&#8208;magnesium salt electrolyte. Raman spectroscopy and density function theory calculation confirm that [Mg2Cl3&#183;6THF]+[Mg(pftb)3]&#8211; is the main electrochemically active species of the electrolyte. The proper lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level of the [Mg(pftb)3]&#8211; anion enables in&#8208;situ formation of a stable a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Mg anodes. A detailed analysis of the SEI reveals that its stability originates from a dual&#8208;layered organic/inorganic hybrid structure. Mg//Cu and Mg//Mg cells using the electrolyte achieve a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% over 3000 cycles, and low overpotentials over ultralong&#8208;cycle lives of 8100, 3000, and 1500 h at current densities of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, respectively. The robust SEI layer, once formed on a Mg electrode, is also shown highly effective in suppressing side&#8208;reactions in a TFSI&#8211;&#8208;containing electrolyte. A high Coulombic efficiency of 99.5% over 800 cycles is also demonstrated for a Mg//Mo6S8 full cell, showing great promise of the SEI forming electrolyte in future Mg batteries.

         <title>Elastic Lattice Enabling Reversible Tetrahedral Li Storage Sites in High&#8208;Capacity Manganese Oxide Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The key to breaking through the capacity limitation imposed by intercalating chemistry lies in the ability to harness more active sites that can reversibly accommodate more ions (e.g., Li+) and electrons within a finite space. However, excessive Li&#8208;ion insertion into Li layer of layered cathodes result in fast performance decay due to the huge lattice change and irreversible phase transformation. In this study, an ultra&#8208;high reversible capacity is demonstrated by a layered oxide cathode purely based on manganese. Through a wealth of characterizations, it is clarified that the presence of low&#8208;content Li2MnO3 domains not only reduces the amount of irreversible O loss; but also regulates Mn migration in LiMnO2 domains, enabling elastic lattice with high reversibility for tetrahedral sites Li&#8208;ion storage in Li layers. Our work utilizs bulk cation disorder to create stable Li&#8208;ions storage tetrahedral sites and elastic lattice for layered materials, with a reversible capacity of 600&#160;mA h g&#8211;1 demonstrated in 0.6&#8208; 4.9&#160;V versus Li/Li+ at 10&#160;mA g&#8211;1. Admittedly, discharging to 0.6&#160;V might be too low for practical use, this exploration is still of great importance as it conceptually demonstrates the limit of Li&#8208;ions insertion into layered oxide materials.

         <title>Prediction and Design of Nanozymes using Explainable Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is a time&#8208;consuming, laborious, and resource&#8208;intensive task to control the catalytic activity of nanozymes. A data&#8208;driven approach that utilizes machine&#8208;learning algorithms is trained on extracted data to understand particle&#8211;property relationships, allowing for classification and quantitative predictions of enzyme&#8208;like activity exhibited by nanozymes. This study offers a promising model to develop nanozymes with desirable catalytic activity.








Abstract
An abundant number of nanomaterials have been discovered to possess enzyme&#8208;like catalytic activity, termed nanozymes. It is identified that a variety of internal and external factors influence the catalytic activity of nanozymes. However, there is a lack of essential methodologies to uncover the hidden mechanisms between nanozyme features and enzyme&#8208;like activity. Here, a data&#8208;driven approach is demonstrated that utilizes machine&#8208;learning algorithms to understand particle&#8211;property relationships, allowing for classification and quantitative predictions of enzyme&#8208;like activity exhibited by nanozymes. High consistency between predicted outputs and the observations is confirmed by accuracy (90.6%) and R2 (up to 0.80). Furthermore, sensitive analysis of the models reveals the central roles of transition metals in determining nanozyme activity. As an example, the models are successfully applied to predict or design desirable nanozymes by uncovering the hidden relationship between different periods of transition metals and their enzyme&#8208;like performance. This study offers a promising strategy to develop nanozymes with desirable catalytic activity and demonstrates the potential of machine learning within the field of material science.

         <title>2D&#8208;Topology&#8208;Seeded Graphitization for Highly Thermally Conductive Carbon Fibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D&#8208;topology&#8208;seeded graphitization strategy effectively generates a new species of highly thermally conductive carbon fibers. Strong mechanical strength and high thermal conductivity up to 850 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 are simultaneously realized, which are one order of magnitude more conductive than commercial PAN&#8208;based carbon fibers. These fibers have great potential for lightweight thermal&#8208;management materials, high&#8208;power electronics, and energy storage.








Abstract
Highly thermally conductive carbon fibers (CFs) have become an important material to meet the increasing demand for efficient heat dissipation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highly thermally conductive carbon fibers (CFs) have become an important material to meet the increasing demand for efficient heat dissipation. To date, high thermal conductivity has been only achieved in specific pitch-based CFs with high crystallinity. However, obtaining high graphitic crystallinity and high thermal conductivity beyond pitch-CFs remains a grand challenge. Here, a 2D-topology-seeded graphitization method is presented to mediate the topological incompatibility in graphitization by seeding 2D graphene oxide (GO) sheets into the polyacrylonitrile (PAN) precursor. Strong mechanical strength and high thermal conductivity up to 850 W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; are simultaneously realized, which are one order of magnitude higher in conductivity than commercial PAN-based CFs. The self-oxidation and seeded graphitization effect generate large crystallite size and high orientation to far exceed those of conventional CFs. Topologically seeded graphitization, verified in experiments and simulations, allows conversion of the non-graphitizable into graphitizable materials by incorporating 2D seeds. This method extends the preparation of highly thermally conductive CFs, which has great potential for lightweight thermal-management materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Promoting Ex&#8208;Solution from Metal&#8211;Organic&#8208;Framework&#8208;Mediated Oxide Scaffolds for Highly Active and Robust Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ex&#8208;solution process is reconceptualized with the design of the host oxide structure using a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) as an oxide precursor. Owing to the structural advantages of the MOF, higher levels of doping and more uniform ex&#8208;solution are enabled. These ex&#8208;solved materials attain a record&#8208;breaking performance in acetone oxidation and acetone&#8208;detection reactions.








Abstract
Ex&#8208;solution catalysts, in which a host oxide is decorated with confined metallic nanoparticles, have exhibited breakthrough activity in various catalytic reactions. However, catalysts prepared by conventional ex&#8208;solution processes are limited by the low surface area of host oxides, the limited solubility of dopants, and the incomplete conversion of doped cations into metal catalysts. Here, the design of the host oxide structure is reconceptualized using a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) as an oxide precursor that can absorb a large quantity of ions while also promoting ex&#8208;solution at low temperatures (400&#8211;500&#160;&#176;C). The MOF&#8208;derived metal oxide host can readily incorporate metal cations, from which catalytic nanoparticles can be uniformly ex&#8208;solved owing to the short diffusion length in the nano&#8208;sized oxides. The distinct ex&#8208;solution behaviors of Pt, Pd, and Rh, and their bimetallic combinations are investigated. The MOF&#8208;driven mesoporous ZnO particles functionalized with PdPt catalysts ex&#8208;solved at 500&#160;&#176;C show benchmark&#8208;level of acetone oxidation activity as well as acetone&#8208;sensing characteristics by accelerating both oxygen chemisorption and acetone dissociation. Their findings provide a new route for the preparation of highly active catalysts by engineering the architecture and composition of the host oxide to facilitate the ex&#8208;solution process rationally.

         <title>Engineered Nanoerythrocytes Alleviate Central Nervous System Inflammation by Regulating the Polarization of Inflammatory Microglia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microglia are the main regulator of inflammatory response in ischemic stroke and multiple sclerosis. An engineered nanoerythrocyte immunosuppressive platform is developed for precise targeting and efficient reprogramming of M1 microglia. The regulation of microglia function, protection of the blood&#8211;brain barrier, and neurons are realized through upregulation of heme oxygenase&#8208;1 and reinforcement by intrinsic metabolism to generate anti&#8208;inflammatory substances CO and bilirubin.








Abstract
Microglial polarization is one of the most promising therapeutic strategies for multiple central nervous system (CNS) disorders. However, safe, effective, and controllable microglial regulation still faces formidable challenges. Although some anti&#8208;inflammatory factors promote microglia polarization, their short half&#8208;life, high cost, unpredictable in vivo behavior, and complex delivery operations, hamper their clinical application. Here, inspired by the natural microhemorrhage cleaning mechanism, an MG1 peptide and RVG29 peptide engineered nanoerythrocyte (NEMR) that can reprogram microglia are developed from classical M1 toward alternative M2 by inducing heme oxygenase&#8208;1 (HO&#8208;1), stimulating Notch1/Hes1/Stat3 signaling, and further inhibiting NF&#8208;&#954;B p65 translocation. Moreover, anti&#8208;inflammatory carbon monoxide (CO) and bilirubin produced by endogenous metabolism of heme further reinforces the anti&#8208;inflammatory effect. In middle cerebral artery occlusion and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models, a satisfactory prognosis is achieved, with precise regulation of inflammatory microglia in lesion sites, increased expression of anti&#8208;inflammatory factors, reduced blood&#8211;brain barrier permeability, as well as promotion of neurogenesis and functional recovery. Furthermore, NEMR can be integrated with clinical therapeutic agents, which facilitates precise drug delivery to enhance therapeutic effects. Hence, the natural nanoerythrocytes, as a feasible, efficient, safe, and practical tool, provides a new strategy for rebalancing of the immune environment in the CNS disorders.

         <title>Sr&#8208;Doped Superionic Hydrogen Glass: Synthesis and Properties of SrH22</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under high pressure, strontium reacts with hydrogen forming molecular SrH22&#8212;a yellow&#8208;orange semiconductor with the bandgap of &#8776;1.8&#160;eV. SrH22 has a glassy superionic hydrogen sublattice stabilized by a solid framework of Sr atoms. The formation of hydrogen glass is a new phenomenon that may have a significant impact on the development of new materials for hydrogen storage and high&#8208;pressure electrochemistry.








Abstract
Recently, several research groups announced reaching the point of metallization of hydrogen above 400&#160;GPa. Despite notable progress, detecting superconductivity in compressed hydrogen remains an unsolved problem. Following the mainstream of extensive investigations of compressed metal polyhydrides, here small doping of molecular hydrogen by strontium is demonstrated to lead to a dramatic reduction in the metallization pressure to &#8776;200&#160;GPa. Studying the high&#8208;pressure chemistry of the Sr&#8211;H system, the formation of several new phases is observed: C2/m&#8208;Sr3H13, pseudocubic SrH6, SrH9 with cubic F4&#175;3m$F\bar{4}3m$&#8208;Sr sublattice, and pseudo tetragonal superionic P1&#8208;SrH22, the metal hydride with the highest hydrogen content (96 at%) discovered so far. High diffusion coefficients of hydrogen in the latter phase DH&#160;= 0.2&#8211;2.1 &#215; 10&#8722;9 m2 s&#8722;1 indicate an amorphous state of the H&#8208;sublattice, whereas the strontium sublattice remains solid. Unlike Ca and Y, strontium forms molecular semiconducting polyhydrides, whereas calcium and yttrium polyhydrides are high&#8208;TC superconductors with an atomic H sublattice. The discovered SrH22, a kind of hydrogen sponge, opens a new class of materials with ultrahigh content of hydrogen.

         <title>Flexible and Tough Superelastic Co&#8211;Cr Alloys for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel developed Co&#8211;Cr&#8208;based biomaterial not only has a low Young's modulus (10&#8211;30 GPa) similar to human bone, but also a high wear resistance, disrupting the trade&#8208;off relation in conventional metallic biomaterials. The thermoelastic martensitic transformation of these alloys allows a huge recoverable superelastic strain up to 17.0%, which is twice that of commercial Ti&#8211;Ni.








Abstract
The demand for biomaterials has been increasing along with the increase in the population of elderly people worldwide. The mechanical properties and high wear resistance of metallic biomaterials make them well&#8208;suited for use as substitutes or as support for damaged hard tissues. However, unless these biomaterials also have a low Young's modulus similar to that of human bones, bone atrophy inevitably occurs. Because a low Young's modulus is typically associated with poor wear resistance, it is difficult to realize a low Young's modulus and high wear resistance simultaneously. Also, the superelastic property of shape&#8208;memory alloys makes them suitable for biomedical applications, like vascular stents and guide wires. However, due to the low recoverable strain of conventional biocompatible shape&#8208;memory alloys, the demand for a new alloy system is high. The novel body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic cobalt&#8211;chromium&#8208;based alloys in this work provide a solution to both of these problems. The Young's modulus of &lt;001&gt;&#8208;oriented&#160;single&#8208;crystal cobalt&#8211;chromium&#8208;based alloys is 10&#8211;30 GPa, which is similar to that of human bone, and they also demonstrate high wear and corrosion resistance. They also exhibit superelasticity with a huge recoverable strain up to 17.0%. For these reasons, the novel cobalt&#8211;chromium&#8208;based alloys can be promising candidates for biomedical applications.

         <title>Dual Self&#8208;Built Gating Boosts the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A design strategy, namely &#8220;dual self&#8208;built gating&#8221; is reported to boost the hydrogen evolution reaction. Taking ReS2 and WS2 as an example, dual self&#8208;built gating induces electrons from WS2 to ReS2 directionally. The tailored electronic structure can balance the adsorption of intermediates and the desorption of hydrogen synergistically, thus greatly promoting the intrinsic activity of the active sites.








Abstract
Optimizing the intrinsic activity of active sites is an appealing strategy for accelerating the kinetics of the catalytic process. Here, a design principle, namely &#8220;dual self&#8208;built gating&#8221;, is proposed to tailor the electronic structures of catalysts. Catalytic improvement is confirmed in a model catalyst with a ReS2&#8211;WS2/WS2 hybridized heterostructure. As demonstrated in experimental and theoretical results, the dual gating can bidirectionally guide electron transfer and redistribute at the interface, endowing the model catalyst with an electron&#8208;rich region. The tailored electronic structures balance the adsorption of intermediates and the desorption of hydrogen synergistically to enhance the reaction kinetics for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Interestingly, the effect of dual gating can be easily amplified by the electric field. The overpotential and Tafel slope (49&#160;mV, 35&#160;mV dec&#8722;1) obtained under the electric field for ReS2&#8211;WS2/WS2 catalyst with the dual self&#8208;built gating effect are far below than those (210&#160;mV, 116&#160;mV dec&#8722;1) of the pure WS2 catalyst, which exhibits nearly four times improvement. The concept of dual gating can be applied to more systems, offering a new guideline for designing advanced electrocatalysts.

         <title>Highly Selective Adsorption of Perfluorinated Greenhouse Gases by Porous Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Anthropogenic greenhouse gases contribute to global warming. Among those gases, perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are thousands to tens of thousands times more harmful to the environment than comparable amounts of carbon dioxide. Till date, materials that selectively adsorb perfluorocarbons in favor to other less harmful gases have not been reported. Here a series of porous organic cage compounds with alkyl&#8208;, fluoroalkyl&#8208;, and partially fluorinated alkyl groups is presented. Their isomorphic crystalline states allowed us to study the property&#8208;relationship of the degree of fluorination of the alkyl chains on gas sorption properties for PFCs and their selective uptakes in comparison to other, non&#8208;fluorinated gases. By this approach, one compound was identified, having superior selectivities of PFCs versus N2 or CO2 under ambient conditions.

         <title>A Light&#8208;Hole Germanium Quantum Well on Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silicon&#8208;integrated light&#8208;hole quantum wells: a versatile platform toward coherent optical photon&#8211;spin interfaces for a direct mapping of the quantum information encoded in photon flying qubits to stationary spin processor is reported.








Abstract
The quiet quantum environment of holes in solid&#8208;state devices is at the core of increasingly reliable architectures for quantum processors and memories. However, due to the lack of scalable materials to properly tailor the valence band character and its energy offsets, the precise engineering of light&#8208;hole (LH) states remains a serious obstacle toward coherent optical photon&#8211;spin interfaces needed for a direct mapping of the quantum information encoded in photon flying qubits to stationary spin processors. Herein, to alleviate this long&#8208;standing limitation, an all&#8208;group&#8208;IV low&#8208;dimensional system is demonstrated, consisting of a highly tensile strained germanium quantum well grown on silicon allowing new degrees of freedom to control and manipulate the hole states. Wafer&#8208;level, high bi&#8208;isotropic in&#8208;plane tensile strain (&lt;1%) is achieved using strain&#8208;engineered, metastable germanium&#8211;tin alloyed buffer layers yielding quantum wells with LH ground state, high g&#8208;factor anisotropy, and a tunable splitting of the hole sub&#8208;bands. The epitaxial heterostructures display sharp interfaces with sub&#8208;nanometer broadening and show room&#8208;temperature excitonic transitions that are modulated and extended to the mid&#8208;wave infrared by controlling strain and thickness. This ability to engineer quantum structures with LH selective confinement and controllable optical response enables manufacturable silicon&#8208;compatible platforms relevant to integrated quantum communication and sensing technologies.

         <title>Water&#8208;Triggered Stiffening of Shape&#8208;Memory Polyurethanes Composed of Hard Backbone Dangling PEG Soft Segments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the thermally triggered phase transformation process and &#8220;soft&#8208;to&#8208;stiff&#8221; achieved by lattice distortion of shape&#8208;memory alloys, a series of water&#8208;triggered stiffening shape&#8208;memory polyurethane are developed. They can achieve &#8220;soft&#8208;to&#8208;stiff&#8221; transition by forming more continuous hard domains upon hydration.








Abstract
Shape&#8208;memory polymers (SMPs) induced by heat or water are commonly used candidates for biomedical applications. Shape recovery inevitably leads to a dramatic decrease of Young's modulus due to the enhanced flexibility of polymer chains at the transition temperature. Herein, the principle of phase&#8208;transition&#8208;induced stiffening of shape&#8208;memory metallic alloys (SMAs) is introduced to the design of molecular structures for shape&#8208;memory polyurethane (SMPUs), featuring all&#8208;hard segments composed of main chains that are attached with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) dangling side chains. Different from conventional SMPs, they achieve a soft&#8208;to&#8208;stiff transition when shape recovers. The stiffening process is driven by water&#8208;triggered segmental rearrangement due to the incompatibility between the hard segments and the soft PEG segments. Upon hydration, the extent of microphase separation is enhanced and the hard domains are transformed to a more continuous morphology to realize more effective stress transfer. Meanwhile, such segmental rearrangement facilitates the shape&#8208;recovery process in the hydrated state despite the final increased glass transition temperature (Tg). This work represents a novel paradigm of simultaneously integrating balanced mechanics, shape&#8208;memory property, and biocompatibility for SMPUs as materials for minimally invasive surgery such as endoluminal stents.

         <title>Enabling 100C Fast&#8208;Charging Bulk Bi Anodes for Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the difficulty in simultaneously achieving a large capacity, ultrafast charging capability, and long cycling stability in a battery anode, a bulk Bi anode is presented for Na&#8208;ion batteries that provides a simple yet practical route&#160;to address this issue without using expensive nanoscale materials and additional complex modifications.








Abstract
It is challenging to develop alloying anodes with ultrafast charging and large energy storage using bulk anode materials because of the difficulty of carrier&#8208;ion diffusion and fragmentation of the active electrode material. Herein, a rational strategy is reported to design bulk Bi anodes for Na&#8208;ion batteries that feature ultrafast charging, long cyclability, and large energy storage without using expensive nanomaterials and surface modifications. It is found that bulk Bi particles gradually transform into a porous nanostructure during cycling in a glyme&#8208;based electrolyte, whereas the resultant structure stores Na ions by forming phases with high Na diffusivity. These features allow the anodes to exhibit unprecedented electrochemical properties; the developed Na&#8211;Bi half&#8208;cell delivers 379&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 (97% of that measured at 1C) at 7.7&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 (20C) during 3500 cycles. It also retained 94% and 93% of the capacity measured at 1C even at extremely fast&#8208;charging rates of 80C and 100C, respectively. The structural origins of the measured properties are verified by experiments and first&#8208;principles calculations. The findings of this study not only broaden understanding of the underlying mechanisms of fast&#8208;charging anodes, but also provide basic guidelines for searching battery anodes that simultaneously exhibit high capacities, fast kinetics, and long cycling stabilities.

         <title>Boosting H2 Production from a BiVO4 Photoelectrochemical Biomass Fuel Cell by the Construction of a Bridge for Charge and Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique BiVO4 photoelectrochemical fuel cell is successfully developed by utilizing the low&#8208;cost tartaric acid biomass as an organic fuel. The strong complexation between BiVO4 and tartaric acid provides a bridge for charge and energy transfer. The optimal BiVO4 photoanode exhibits a remarkable current density of 13.54 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode under AM1.5G.








Abstract
Utilizing a photoelectrochemical (PEC) fuel cell to replace difficult water oxidation with facile oxidation of organic wastes is regarded as an effective method to improve the H2 production efficiency. However, in most reported PEC fuel cells, their PEC activities are still low and the energy in organic fuels cannot be effectively utilized. Here, a unique BiVO4 PEC fuel cell is successfully developed by utilizing the low&#8208;cost biomass, tartaric acid, as an organic fuel. Thanks to the strong complexation between BiVO4 and tartaric acid, a bridge for the charge and energy transfer is successfully constructed, which not only improves the photoelectric conversion efficiency of BiVO4, but also effectively converts the chemical energy of biomass into H2. Remarkably, under AM1.5G illumination, the optimal nanoporous BiVO4 photoanode exhibits a high current density of 13.54&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for H2 production, which is higher than that of previously reported PEC water splitting systems or PEC fuel cell systems. This work opens a new path for solving the low PEC H2 production efficiency and provides a new idea for improving the performances and energy conversion efficiency in traditional PEC fuel cells.

         <title>Modulation of the Crosstalk between Schwann Cells and Macrophages for Nerve Regeneration: A Therapeutic Strategy Based on a Multifunctional Tetrahedral Framework Nucleic Acids System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional tetrahedral framework nucleic acids (tFNAs) system, denoted as MiDs, is reported, which integrates the nerve regenerative potential of microRNA&#8208;22 and tFNAs to enhance the peripheral nerve regeneration by improving the communication between Schwann cells (SCs) and macrophages. MiDs can rapidly initiate the repair procedures of SCs and facilitate the polarization of macrophages into M2 macrophages to reconstruct the post&#8208;injury microenvironment.








Abstract
Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) is currently recognized as one of the most significant public health issues and affects the general well&#8208;being of millions of individuals worldwide. Despite advances in nerve tissue engineering, nerve repair still cannot guarantee complete functional recovery. In the present study, an innovative approach is adopted to establish a multifunctional tetrahedral framework nucleic acids (tFNAs) system, denoted as MiDs, which can integrate the powerful programmability, permeability, and structural stability of tFNAs, with the nerve regeneration potential of microRNA&#8208;22 to enhance the communication between Schwann cells (SCs) and macrophages for more effective functional rehabilitation of peripheral nerves. Relevant results demonstrate that MiDs can amplify the ability of SCs to recruit macrophages and facilitate their polarization into the pro&#8208;healing M2 phenotype to reconstruct the post&#8208;injury microenvironment. Furthermore, MiDs can initiate the adaptive intracellular reprogramming of SCs within a short period to further promote axon regeneration and remyelination. MiDs represent a new possibility for enhancing nerve repair and may have critical clinical applications in the future.

         <title>A Unique Fe&#8211;N4 Coordination System Enabling Transformation of Oxygen into Superoxide for Photocatalytic C&#63743;H Activation with High Efficiency and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activation of the &#945;&#8208;C&#63743;H bond of ethylbenzene by use of photocatalysis&#8208;generated superoxide anions (O2&#8226;&#8722;) remains a challenge. In this work, the formation of individual Fe atoms on polymeric carbon nitride, that activates O2&#160;to create O2&#8226;&#8722; for facilitating the reaction of ethylbenzene to form acetophenone, is demonstrated.








Abstract
Selective oxidation of C&#63743;H bonds is one of the most important reactions in organic synthesis. However, activation of the &#945;&#8208;C&#63743;H bond of ethylbenzene by use of photocatalysis&#8208;generated superoxide anions (O2&#8226;&#8722;) remains a challenge. Herein, the formation of individual Fe atoms on polymeric carbon nitride (CN), that activates O2&#160;to create O2&#8226;&#8722; for facilitating the reaction of ethylbenzene to form acetophenone, is demonstrated. By utilizing density functional theory and materials characterization techniques, it is shown that individual Fe atoms are coordinated to four N atoms of CN and the resultant low&#8208;spin Fe&#8211;N4&#160;system (t2g6eg0) is not only a great adsorption site for oxygen molecules, but also allows for fast transfer of electrons generated in the CN framework to adsorbed O2, producing O2&#8226;&#8722;. The oxidation reaction of ethylbenzene triggered by O2&#8226;&#8722; ions turns out to have a high conversion rate of 99% as well as an acetophenone selectivity of 99%, which can be ascribed to a novel reaction pathway that is different from the conventional route involving hydroxyl radicals and the production of phenethyl alcohol. Furthermore, it possesses great potential for other C&#63743;H activation reactions besides ethylbenzene oxidation.

         <title>Structural Regulation of Coupled Phthalocyanine&#8208;Porphyrin Covalent Organic Frameworks to Highly Active and Selective Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been applied as potential electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) due to their adjustable architecture and porous feature. Herein, tetraanhydrides of 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24&#8208;octacarboxyphthalocyanine cobalt(II) (CoTAPc) is used as node to couple with 5,15&#8208;di(4&#8208;aminophenyl)&#8208;10,20&#8208;diphenylporphyrin (DAPor) or 5,15,10,20&#8208;tetrayl(4&#8208;aminophenyl)porphyrin (TAPor) via imidization reaction to fabricate novel coupled phthalocyanine&#8208;porphyrin Type 1:2 (CoPc&#8208;2H2Por) or Type 1:1 (CoPc&#8208;H2Por) COFs for the first time. Electrocatalytic CO2RR experiments show that both Type 1:2 and Type 1:1 COFs exhibit the maximum Faraday efficiency over 90% with high stability, while Type 1:2 COF (CoPc&#8208;2H2Por) delivers lower overpotential, higher current density and CO selectivity than Type 1:1 COF (CoPc&#8208;H2Por) and CoPc monomer. Theoretical and experimental results reveal that the better CO2RR activity of CoPc&#8208;2H2Por than CoPc&#8208;H2Por can be attributed to its larger pore size and conjugate structure, which then cause more efficient electron transfer, adsorption/activation of CO2, faster mass transfer and reaction kinetics. This work provides a new idea in the structural design of COF&#8208;based electrocatalyst for efficient CO2RR.

         <title>All&#8208;Organic Self&#8208;Powered Photodetector with Ultra&#8208;Flexible Dual&#8208;Polarity Output for Bio&#8208;Signal Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Endowing photodetectors with mechanically flexibility and actual functionality are current research issues in developing optoelectronic devices. However, rigid metal&#8208;based or metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;based electrodes remain a block to the realization of ultra&#8208;flexible electronics. Thus, we design an ultra&#8208;flexible all&#8208;organic photodetectors (all&#8208;OPD) by innovatively introducing symmetrical organic electrodes PH1000/PH1000 to substitute the widely applied ITO/Ag electrodes. Specifically, this all&#8208;OPD exhibits a high self&#8208;powered responsivity (R) of over 100&#160;mA/W among 500&#8211;600&#160;nm and the photocurrent remains about 80% of the original performance after being bent 20000 circles, which can output steady bio&#8208;signals for photoplethysmography (PPG) application. More importantly, this all&#8208;OPD outputs dual&#8208;polarity photocurrent as it is flipped or folded. Benefitting from the ordered phase distribution and designed Schottky barrier heights, the photogenerated holes will be transferred and collected by nearer electrode, while electrons will be trapped in the thick bulk heterojunction (BHJ) as a result of the long channel. Our work offers a new avenue towards developing a multifunctional and ultra&#8208;flexible all&#8208;OPD with a straightforward all&#8208;solution method, and it is expected to be more compatible in complex application scenarios.

         <title>Blading of Conformal Electron Transport Layers in p&#8208;i&#8208;n Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are promising to reduce the cost of photovoltaic system due to their low&#8208;cost raw materials and high&#8208;throughput solution process, however it has not been demonstrated yet to fabricate all the active layers in perovskite modules using scalable solution process. Herein, we report the fabrication of highly efficient PSCs and modules in ambient conditions with all layers bladed except the metal electrode by overcoming the challenges of blading of 36&#177;9&#160;nm&#160;thick electron transport layer (ETL) on perovskite films with a roughness of &#8764;80&#160;nm. A combination of additives in phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) allows PCBM to conformally cover perovskites and still have a good electrical conductivity. Amine functionalized molecules are added to enhance both the dispersity of PCBM molecules and the affinity to perovskites. A PCBM dopant of 4&#8208;(2,3&#8208;Dihydro&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylbenzenamine (N&#8208;DMBI) recovers the conductivity loss induced by small amine functionalized molecules. Perovskite solar cells (0.08 cm2) fabricated by all blading process have reached an average efficiency of &#8764;22.4&#177;0.5%&#160;and a champion efficiency of 23.1% for perovskites with a bandgap of 1.51&#160;eV, with much better stability compared to evaporated ETL solar cells. The all&#8208;bladed minimodule with an area of 25.03 cm2 shows an aperture efficiency of &#8764;19.3%, showing the good uniformity of the bladed ETLs.

         <title>Insights into Redox Processes and Correlated Performance of Organic Carbonyl Electrode Materials in Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic carbonyl compounds have been considered as promising electrode materials for high&#8208;performance rechargeable batteries. However, their redox processes and performance need to be fully understood. An in&#8208;depth understanding on redox processes and the correlated electrochemical performance of organic carbonyl electrode materials is provided, with the aim of promoting their practical applications in the foreseeable future.








Abstract
Organic carbonyl electrode materials have shown great prospects for rechargeable batteries in view of their high capacity, flexible designability, and sustainable production. However, organic carbonyl electrode materials still suffer from unsatisfactory electrochemical performance, which is highly relevant to their redox processes. Herein, an in&#8208;depth understanding on redox processes and the correlated electrochemical performance of organic carbonyl electrode materials is provided. The redox processes discussed mainly involve molecular structure evolution (intermediates), crystal structure evolution (phase transition), and charge storage mechanisms. The properties of intermediates can affect voltage, cycling stability, reversible capacity, and rate performance of batteries. Moreover, the reversible capacity/cycling stability and rate performance would be also influenced by phase transition and charge storage mechanisms (diffusion&#8208; or surface&#8208;controlled), respectively. To accelerate the practical applications of organic carbonyl electrode materials, future work should focus on developing more in situ or operando characterization techniques and further understanding the intrinsic relationships between redox processes and performance. It is hoped that the work discussed herein will stimulate more attention to the detailed redox processes and their correlations with the performance of organic carbonyl electrode materials in rechargeable batteries.

Conjugated polyelectrolytes are characterized by an electronically delocalized backbone bearing ionic functionalities. These features lead to properties relevant for use in energy&#8208;storing pseudocapacitor devices, including ionic conductivity, water processability, gel formation, and formation of polaronic species stabilized by electrostatic interactions. Moreover, that conjugated polyelectrolytes are miscible in aqueous media enables living materials that can switch from energy production to energy storage.








Abstract
Conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) are characterized by an electronically delocalized backbone bearing ionic functionalities. These features lead to properties relevant for use in energy&#8208;storing pseudocapacitor devices, including ionic conductivity, water processability, gel&#8208;formation, and formation of polaronic species stabilized by electrostatic interactions. In this Perspective, the basis for evaluating the figures of merit for pseudocapacitors is provided, together with the techniques used for their evaluation. The general utility and challenges encountered with neutral conjugated polymers are then discussed. Finally, recent advances on the use of CPEs in pseudocapacitor devices are reviewed. The article is concluded by discussing how their miscibility in aqueous media permits the incorporation of CPEs in living materials that are capable of switching function from extraction of energy from bacterial metabolic pathways to pseudocapacitor energy storage.

         <title>Assessing the Photovoltaic Quality of Vacuum&#8208;Thermal Evaporated Organic Semiconductor Blends</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art vacuum thermal&#8208;evaporated organic solar cells (VTE OSCs) in their photovoltaic material quality is assessed. The comprehensive optoelectronic characterization yields four key metrics governing OSC performance&#8212;a new methodology that equally applies to solution&#8208;processed OSCs. The five studied material blends give a representative overview of today's VTE OSCs and needs for improvement are identified for this industrially leading OSC technology.








Abstract
Vacuum&#8208;thermal evaporation (VTE) is a highly relevant fabrication route for organic solar cells (OSCs), especially on an industrial scale as proven by the commercialization of organic light emitting diode&#8208;based displays. While OSC performance is reported for a range of VTE&#8208;deposited molecules, a comprehensive assessment of donor:acceptor blend properties with respect to their photovoltaic performance is scarce. Here, the organic thin films and solar cells of three select systems are fabricated and ellipsometry, external quantum efficiency with high dynamic range, as well as OTRACE are measured to quantify absorption, voltage losses, and charge carrier mobility. These parameters are key to explain OSC performance and will help to rationalize the performance of other material systems reported in literature as the authors&#8217; methodology is applicable beyond VTE systems. Furthermore, it can help to judge the prospects of new molecules in general. The authors find large differences in the measured values and find that today's VTE OSCs can reach high extinction coefficients, but only moderate mobility and voltage loss compared to their solution&#8208;processed counterparts. What needs to be improved for VTE OSCs is outlined to again catch up with their solution&#8208;processed counterparts in terms of power conversion efficiency.

         <title>Tuning Conjugated Polymer Chain Packing for Stretchable Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulky additive molecules residing between amorphous chain networks can disrupt the crystalline ordering of polymer semiconductors. The long&#8208;range crystalline domains are suppressed while short&#8208;range aggregations of conjugated polymers are promoted, leading to an improved thin&#8208;film stretchability without affecting charge transport under an external strain up to 100%.








Abstract
In order to apply polymer semiconductors to stretchable electronics, they need to be easily deformed under strain without being damaged. A small number of conjugated polymers, typically with semicrystalline packing structures, have been reported to exhibit mechanical stretchability. Herein, a method is reported to modify polymer semiconductor packing&#8208;structure using a molecular additive, dioctyl phthalate (DOP), which is found to act as a molecular spacer, to be inserted between the amorphous chain networks and disrupt the crystalline packing. As a result, large&#8208;crystal growth is suppressed while short&#8208;range aggregations of conjugated polymers are promoted, which leads to an improved mechanical stretchability without affecting charge&#8208;carrier transport. Due to the reduced conjugated polymer intermolecular interactions, strain&#8208;induced chain alignment and crystallization are observed. By adding DOP to a well&#8208;known conjugated polymer, poly[2,5&#8208;bis(4&#8208;decyltetradecyl)pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole&#8208;1,4&#8208;(2H,5H)&#8208;dione&#8208;(E)&#8208;1,2&#8208;di(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophen&#8208;5&#8208;yl)ethene] (DPPTVT), stretchable transistors are obtained with anisotropic charge&#8208;carrier mobilities under strain, and stable current output under strain up to 100%.

         <title>Controlled n&#8208;Doping of Naphthalene&#8208;Diimide&#8208;Based 2D Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bulk conductivity of naphthalene&#8208;diimide&#8208;based 2D polymers is increased by controlled stoichiometric n&#8208;doping with cobaltocene. Following single&#8208;electron reduction, these 2DPs retain their periodic structure and become paramagnetic. Substoichiometric doping leads to the highest bulk electronic conductivities, which is found to proceed through a hopping&#8208;mechanism.








Abstract
2D polymers (2DPs) are promising as structurally well&#8208;defined, permanently porous, organic semiconductors. However, 2DPs are nearly always isolated as closed shell organic species with limited charge carriers, which leads to low bulk conductivities. Here, the bulk conductivity of two naphthalene diimide (NDI)&#8208;containing 2DP semiconductors is enhanced by controllably n&#8208;doping the NDI units using cobaltocene (CoCp2). Optical and transient microwave spectroscopy reveal that both as&#8208;prepared NDI&#8208;containing 2DPs are semiconducting with sub&#8208;2&#160;eV optical bandgaps and photoexcited charge&#8208;carrier lifetimes of tens of nanoseconds. Following reduction with CoCp2, both 2DPs largely retain their periodic structures and exhibit optical and electron&#8208;spin resonance spectroscopic features consistent with the presence of NDI&#8208;radical anions. While the native NDI&#8208;based 2DPs are electronically insulating, maximum bulk conductivities of &gt;10&#8722;4&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 are achieved by substoichiometric levels of n&#8208;doping. Density functional theory calculations show that the strongest electronic couplings in these 2DPs exist in the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (&#960;&#8208;stacking) crystallographic directions, which indicates that cross&#8208;plane electronic transport through NDI stacks is primarily responsible for the observed electronic conductivity. Taken together, the controlled molecular doping is a useful approach to access structurally well&#8208;defined, paramagnetic, 2DP n&#8208;type semiconductors with measurable bulk electronic conductivities of interest for electronic or spintronic devices.

         <title>Developing the Nondevelopable: Creating Curved&#8208;Surface Electronics from Nonstretchable Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Curved&#8208;surface electronics promise to bring new levels of interactivity, sensitivity, and energy efficiency to our&#160;everyday lives. These curved shapes, however, pose a challenge to established fabrication methods for high&#8208;performance electronics. In this work, ultrathin, nonstretchable planar electronics are attached to nondevelopable surfaces by introducing a shrinkage&#8208;based wrinkling paradigm that can enable future curved devices to leverage developments in flexible electronics.








Abstract
The incorporation of electronics onto curved surfaces promises to bring new levels of intelligence to the ergonomic, aesthetic, aerodynamic, and optical surfaces that are ever&#8208;present in our&#160;lives. However, since many of these surfaces have 2D (i.e., nondevelopable) curvature, they cannot be formed from the deformation of a flat, nonstretchable sheet. This means that curved electronics cannot capitalize on the rapid technological advances taking place in the field of ultrathin electronics, since ultrathin devices, though ultraflexible, are not stretchable. In this work, a shrink&#8208;based paradigm is presented to apply such thin&#8208;film electronics to nondevelopable surfaces, expanding the capabilities of current nondevelopable electronics, and linking future developments in thin&#8208;film technology to similar developments in curved devices. The wrinkling of parylene&#8208;based devices and the effects of shrinkage on common electrical components are examined, culminating in shrinkable touch sensors and organic photovoltaics, laminated to various nondevelopable surfaces without loss of performance.

&lt;p&gt;Curved-surface electronics promise to bring new levels of interactivity, sensitivity, and energy efficiency to our&#160;everyday lives. These curved shapes, however, pose a challenge to established fabrication methods for high-performance electronics. In this work, ultrathin, nonstretchable planar electronics are attached to nondevelopable surfaces by introducing a shrinkage-based wrinkling paradigm that can enable future curved devices to leverage developments in flexible electronics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incorporation of electronics onto curved surfaces promises to bring new levels of intelligence to the ergonomic, aesthetic, aerodynamic, and optical surfaces that are ever-present in our&#160;lives. However, since many of these surfaces have 2D (i.e., nondevelopable) curvature, they cannot be formed from the deformation of a flat, nonstretchable sheet. This means that curved electronics cannot capitalize on the rapid technological advances taking place in the field of ultrathin electronics, since ultrathin devices, though ultraflexible, are not stretchable. In this work, a shrink-based paradigm is presented to apply such thin-film electronics to nondevelopable surfaces, expanding the capabilities of current nondevelopable electronics, and linking future developments in thin-film technology to similar developments in curved devices. The wrinkling of parylene-based devices and the effects of shrinkage on common electrical components are examined, culminating in shrinkable touch sensors and organic photovoltaics, laminated to various nondevelopable surfaces without loss of performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>De Novo Synthesis of Free&#8208;Standing Flexible 2D Intercalated Nanofilm Uniform over Tens of cm2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The de novo synthesis of a 3&#8208;nm&#8208;thick nanofilm intercalating a hydrogen&#8208;bonded water network between two layers of fullerene molecules is reported. The film can be laminated into a multiply film either in situ or by sequential lamination. The film is uniform over an area of 30 cm2, and shows electron&#8208;dose&#8208;dependent reversible bending and proton conductivity up to 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1.








Abstract
Of a variety of intercalated materials, 2D intercalated systems have attracted much attention both as materials per se, and as a platform to study atoms and molecules confined among nanometric layers. High&#8208;precision fabrication of such structures has, however, been a difficult task using the conventional top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up approaches. The de novo synthesis of a 3&#8208;nm&#8208;thick nanofilm intercalating a hydrogen&#8208;bonded network between two layers of fullerene molecules is reported here. The two&#8208;layered film can be further laminated into a multiply film either in situ or by sequential lamination. The 3 nm film forms uniformly over an area of several tens of cm2 at an air/water interface and can be transferred to either flat or perforated substrates. A free&#8208;standing film in air prepared by transfer to a gold comb electrode shows proton conductivity up to 1.4&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1. Electron&#8208;dose&#8208;dependent reversible bending of a free&#8208;standing 6&#8208;nm&#8208;thick nanofilm hung in a vacuum is observed under electron beam irradiation.

         <title>14&#160;GHz Schottky Diodes Using a p&#8208;Doped Organic Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining asymmetric co&#8208;planar nanogap electrodes with a p&#8208;doped organic polymer semiconductor yields Schottky diodes that are capable of operating at 14&#160;GHz, making them the fastest organic electronic devices reported to date.








Abstract
The low carrier mobility of organic semiconductors and the high parasitic resistance and capacitance often encountered in conventional organic Schottky diodes hinder their deployment in emerging radio frequency (RF) electronics. Here, these limitations are overcome by combining self&#8208;aligned asymmetric nanogap electrodes (&#8776;25&#160;nm) produced by adhesion lithography, with a high mobility organic semiconductor, and RF Schottky diodes able to operate in the 5G frequency spectrum are demonstrated. C16IDT&#8208;BT is used, as the high hole mobility polymer, and the impact of p&#8208;doping on the diode performance is studied. Pristine C16IDT&#8208;BT&#8208;based diodes exhibit maximum intrinsic and extrinsic cutoff frequencies (fC) of &gt;100&#160;and 6&#160;GHz, respectively. This extraordinary performance is attributed to the planar nature of the nanogap channel and the diode's small junction capacitance (&lt;2&#160;pF). Doping of C16IDT&#8208;BT with the molecular p&#8208;dopant C60F48 improves the diode's performance further by reducing the series resistance resulting to intrinsic and extrinsic fC of &gt;100&#160;and &#8776;14&#160;GHz respectively, while the DC output voltage of an RF rectifier circuit increases by a tenfold. Our&#160;work highlights the importance of the planar nanogap architecture and paves the way for the use of organic Schottky diodes in large&#8208;area RF electronics of the future.

         <dc:description>
Combining interface assembly of 2D organic semiconductor crystal (2DOSCs) with a poly(dimethylsiloxane)&#8208;mold&#8208;assisted selective contact evaporation printing technique, large&#8208;area, high&#8208;resolution (1271 dpi), and layer&#8208;controlled 2DOSC arrays are fabricated. OFETs based on the 2DOSC arrays show high electrical performance and a small relative variation of 12.5% in mobility. This method will promote the research and application of 2DOSCs.








Abstract
2D organic semiconductor crystals (2DOSCs) have extraordinary charge transport capability, adjustable photoelectric properties, and superior flexibility, and have stimulated continuous research interest for next&#8208;generation electronic and optoelectronic applications. The prerequisite for achieving large&#8208;area and high&#8208;throughput optoelectronic device integration is to fabricate high&#8208;resolution 2DOSC arrays. Patterned substrate&#8208; and template&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly is an effective strategy to fabricate OSC arrays. However, the film thickness is difficult to control due to the complicated crystallization process during solvent evaporation. Therefore, the manufacturing of 2DOSC arrays with high&#8208;resolution and controllable molecular&#8208;layer numbers through solution&#8208;based patterning methods remains a challenge. Herein, a two&#8208;step strategy to produce high&#8208;resolution layer&#8208;controlled 2DOSC arrays is reported. First, large&#8208;scale 2DOSCs with well&#8208;defined layer numbers are obtained by a solution&#8208;processed organic semiconductor crystal engineering method. Next, the high&#8208;resolution layer&#8208;controlled 2DOSC arrays are fabricated by a polydimethylsiloxane mold&#8208;assisted selective contact evaporation printing technique. The organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) based on 2DOSC arrays have high electrical performance and excellent uniformity. The 2,6&#8208;bis(4&#8208;hexylphenyl)anthracene 2DOSC arrays&#8208;based OFETs have a small variation of 12.5% in mobility. This strategy can be applied to various organic semiconductors and pattern arrays. These demonstrations will offer more opportunities for 2DOSCs for integrated optoelectronic devices.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Ion&#8208;Exchange Doping of Conducting Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extremely efficient ion&#8208;exchange doping process for conjugated polymers which enables conductivities exceeding 1000 S cm&#8722;1 is demonstrated. Factors which affect ion exchange, such as electrolyte concentration, doping solvent, and film crystallinity are discussed. When exchange is efficient there is a direct correspondence between ion exchange electrochemical doping, which is used to reveal the detrimental impact of off&#8208;target oxidation reactions.








Abstract
Molecular doping&#8212;the use of redox&#8208;active small molecules as dopants for organic semiconductors&#8212;has seen a surge in research interest driven by emerging applications in sensing, bioelectronics, and thermoelectrics. However, molecular doping carries with it several intrinsic problems stemming directly from the redox&#8208;active character of these materials. A recent breakthrough was&#160;a doping technique based on ion&#8208;exchange, which separates the redox and charge compensation steps of the doping process. Here, the equilibrium and kinetics of ion exchange doping in a model system, poly(2,5&#8208;bis(3&#8208;alkylthiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)thieno(3,2&#8208;b)thiophene) (PBTTT) doped with FeCl3 and an ionic liquid, is studied, reaching conductivities in excess of 1000 S cm&#8722;1 and ion exchange efficiencies above 99%. Several factors that enable such high performance, including the choice of acetonitrile as the doping solvent, which largely eliminates electrolyte association effects and dramatically increases the doping strength of FeCl3, are demonstrated. In this high ion exchange efficiency regime, a simple connection between electrochemical doping and ion exchange is illustrated, and it is shown that the performance and stability of highly doped PBTTT is ultimately limited by intrinsically poor stability at high redox potential.

Here, the equilibrium and kinetics of ion exchange doping in a model system, poly(2,5-bis(3-alkylthiophen-2-yl)thieno(3,2-b)thiophene) (PBTTT) doped with FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and an ionic liquid, is studied, reaching conductivities in excess of 1000 S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and ion exchange efficiencies above 99%. Several factors that enable such high performance, including the choice of acetonitrile as the doping solvent, which largely eliminates electrolyte association effects and dramatically increases the doping strength of FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, are demonstrated. In this high ion exchange efficiency regime, a simple connection between electrochemical doping and ion exchange is illustrated, and it is shown that the performance and stability of highly doped PBTTT is ultimately limited by intrinsically poor stability at high redox potential.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Short Excited&#8208;State Lifetimes Mediate Charge&#8208;Recombination Losses in Organic Solar Cell Blends with Low Charge&#8208;Transfer Driving Force</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic solar cells that employ donor:acceptor blends with near&#8208;zero driving force for charge transfer are becoming prevalent because of their superior performance. In this work, the factors affecting charge transfer and subsequent dissociation of the charge&#8208;transfer state are experimentally and theoretically analyzed. Short excited&#8208;state lifetime and hybridization open up new recombination channels with detrimental effects on free&#8208;charge generation.








Abstract
A blend of a low&#8208;optical&#8208;gap diketopyrrolopyrrole polymer and a fullerene derivative, with near&#8208;zero driving force for electron transfer, is investigated. Using femtosecond transient absorption and electroabsorption spectroscopy, the charge transfer (CT) and recombination dynamics as well as the early&#8208;time transport are quantified. Electron transfer is ultrafast, consistent with a Marcus&#8211;Levich&#8211;Jortner description. However, significant charge recombination and unusually short excited (S1) and CT state lifetimes (&#8776;14&#160;ps) are observed. At low S1&#8211;CT offset, a short S1 lifetime mediates charge recombination because: i) back&#8208;transfer from the CT to the S1 state followed by S1 recombination occurs and ii) additional S1&#8211;CT hybridization decreases the CT lifetime. Both effects are confirmed by density functional theory calculations. In addition, relatively slow (tens of picoseconds) dissociation of charges from the CT state is observed, due to low local charge mobility. Simulations using a four&#8208;state kinetic model entailing the effects of energetic disorder reveal that the free charge yield can be increased from the observed 12% to 60% by increasing the S1 and CT lifetimes to 150&#160;ps. Alternatively, decreasing the interfacial CT state disorder while increasing bulk disorder of free charges enhances the yield to 65% in spite of the short lifetimes.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Triggered Supramolecular Assembly of Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A temperature&#8208;triggered supramolecular assembly process is reported for fabricating highly ordered organic semiconductor arrays. The central concept of the molecule design&#8212;named the "Tetris strategy"&#8212;is to increase the rotational freedom of the molecules through thermal perturbation, thereby inducing conformation locking of adjacent molecules through cooperative [&#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;] interactions.

Abstract
Supramolecular assembly is a promising bottom&#8208;up approach for producing materials that behave as charge transporting components in electronic devices. Although extensive advances have been made during the past two decades, formidable challenges exist in controlling the local randomness present in supramolecular assemblies. Here, a temperature&#8208;triggered supramolecular assembly strategy using heat to heal defects and disorders is reported. The central concept of the molecular design&#8212;named the "Tetris strategy" in this research&#8212;is to: i) increase the rotational freedom of the molecules through thermal perturbation, ii) induce conformation&#8208;fitting of adjacent molecules through two different kinds of intermolecular [&#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;] interactions, and finally iii) lock the nearby molecules in inactive co&#8208;conformations. Experimentally, upon heating to 57&#160;&#176;C, amorphous solid&#8208;state films undergo spontaneous assembly, leading to the growth of uniform and highly ordered microwire arrays. Temperature&#8208;triggered supramolecular assembly provides an approach closer to the precision control of assembled structures and presents with a broad canvas to work on in approaching a new generation of supramolecular electronics.

         <title>Oligoethylene Glycol Side Chains Increase Charge Generation in Organic Semiconductor Nanoparticles for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Employing conjugated polymers functionalized with (oligo)ethylene glycol side chains in nanoparticle photocatalysts can greatly enhance their H2&#8208;evolution efficiency. Glycolation facilitates charge generation and suppresses both geminate and nongeminate charge recombination in donor/acceptor nanoparticles. This results in a high yield of photogenerated charges with lifetimes long enough to efficiently drive ascorbic acid oxidation and H2 evolution.








Abstract
Organic semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs) composed of an electron donor/acceptor (D/A) semiconductor blend have recently emerged as an efficient class of hydrogen&#8208;evolution photocatalysts. It is demonstrated that using conjugated polymers functionalized with (oligo)ethylene glycol side chains in NP photocatalysts can greatly enhance their H2&#8208;evolution efficiency compared to their nonglycolated analogues. The strategy is broadly applicable to a range of structurally diverse conjugated polymers. Transient spectroscopic studies show that glycolation facilitates charge generation even in the absence of a D/A heterojunction, and further suppresses both geminate and nongeminate charge recombination in D/A NPs. This results in a high yield of photogenerated charges with lifetimes long enough to efficiently drive ascorbic acid oxidation, which is correlated with greatly enhanced H2&#8208;evolution rates in the glycolated NPs. Glycolation increases the relative permittivity of the semiconductors and facilitates water uptake. Together, these effects may increase the high&#8208;frequency relative permittivity inside the NPs sufficiently, to cause the observed suppression of exciton and charge recombination responsible for the high photocatalytic activities of the glycolated NPs.

         <title>Emissive Charge&#8208;Transfer States at Hybrid Inorganic/Organic Heterojunctions Enable Low Non&#8208;Radiative Recombination and High&#8208;Performance Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient charge generation mediated by an emissive charge&#8208;transfer state is observed in hybrid heterojunctions comprising the inorganic semiconductor copper thiocyanate and common organic semiconductors. This enables the fabrication of solar cells with very low voltage losses and highly sensitive photodetectors that can detect sub&#8208;picowatt near&#8208;infrared light.








Abstract
Hybrid devices based on a heterojunction between inorganic and organic semiconductors have offered a means to combine the advantages of both classes of materials in optoelectronic devices, but, in practice, the performance of such devices has often been disappointing. Here, it is demonstrated that charge generation in hybrid inorganic&#8211;organic heterojunctions consisting of copper thiocyanate (CuSCN) and a variety of molecular acceptors (ITIC, IT&#8208;4F, Y6, PC70BM, C70, C60) proceeds via emissive charge&#8208;transfer (CT) states analogous to those found at all&#8208;organic heterojunctions. Importantly, contrary to what has been observed at previous organic&#8211;inorganic heterojunctions, the dissociation of the CT&#8208;exciton and subsequent charge separation is efficient, allowing the fabrication of planar photovoltaic devices with very low non&#8208;radiative voltage losses (0.21&#160;&#177; &#8197;0.02&#160;V). It is shown that such low non&#8208;radiative recombination enables the fabrication of simple and cost&#8208;effective near&#8208;IR (NIR) detectors with extremely low dark current (4 pA cm&#8722;2) and noise spectral density (3 fA Hz&#8722;1/2) at no external bias, leading to specific detectivities at NIR wavelengths of just under 1013 Jones, close to the performance of commercial silicon photodetectors. It is believed that this work demonstrates the possibility for hybrid heterojunctions to exploit the unique properties of both inorganic and organic semiconductors for high&#8208;performance opto&#8208;electronic devices.

         <title>Intrinsic Linear Dichroism of Organic Single Crystals toward High&#8208;Performance Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superior organic semiconductor, 2,6&#8208;diphenyl anthracene (DPA), is selected to develop polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors. High&#8208;quality DPA crystals exhibit strong anisotropic nature. Their photodetectors show remarkable polarization sensitivity with a dichroic ratio up to &#8776;1.9. It is revealed that intrinsic linear dichroism is responsible for the observed polarization sensitivity. This work demonstrates the potential of developing efficient polarization&#8208;sensitive organic photodetectors for diverse applications.








Abstract
The ability to detect light in photodetectors is central to practical optoelectronic applications, which has been demonstrated in inorganic semiconductor devices. However, so far, the study of polarization&#8208;sensitive organic photodetectors, which have unique applications in flexible and wearable electronics, has not received much attention. Herein, the construction of polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors based on the single crystals of a superior optoelectronic organic semiconductor, 2,6&#8208;diphenyl anthracene (DPA), is demonstrated. The systematic characterization of two&#8208;dimensionally grown DPA crystals with various techniques definitely show their strong anisotropy in molecular vibration, optical reflectance and optical absorption. In terms of polarization sensitivity, DPA&#8208;crystal based photodetectors exhibit a linear dichroic ratio up to &#8776;1.9. Theoretical calculations confirm that intrinsic linear dichroism, originated from the anisotropic in&#8208;plane crystal structure, is responsible for the polarization sensitivity of DPA crystals. This work opens up a new door for exploiting organic semiconductors for developing highly compact polarization photodetectors and providing new functionalities in novel flexible optical and optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Color&#8208;Tunable All&#8208;Fluorescent White Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with a High External Quantum Efficiency Over 30% and Extended Device Lifetime</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Color&#8208;tunable white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with hole&#8208;trapping thermally activated delayed&#8208;fluorescence&#8208;sensitized emissions realize significant Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage coordinates and correlated&#160;color&#160;temperature shifts from (0.40, 0.47) and 4088 K at 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2 to (0.27, 0.33) and 9269 K at 5000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, with a reported maximum external quantum efficiency of 30.7% and long lifetime of over 20&#160;000 h at 80% of the initial luminance.








Abstract
White organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (WOLEDs) with high efficiencies and tunable colors attracts considerable interest from the industry and academia. Thermally activated delayed&#8208;fluorescence (TADF) emitters can revolutionize such WOLED devices; however, they still suffer from poor performances. In this study, an advanced double&#8208;emissive&#8208;layer device architecture capable of hole&#8208;trapping TADF&#8208;sensitized emissions is proposed to not only achieve a recombination zone shift for the tunable colors but also accelerate exciton emission dynamics for high efficiency and alleviated roll&#8208;off. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept WOLEDs exhibit significant shifts in their Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates and correlated color temperatures from (0.40, 0.47) and 4088 K at 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2 to (0.27, 0.33) and 9269 K at 5000&#160;cd m&#8722;2. Additionally, the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) reaches 30.7% and remains &gt;25%&#160;over a wide luminance range of 500&#8211;5000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, along with an extended LT80 of over 20&#160;000 h at an initial luminance of 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2. This is the first time that all&#8208;fluorescent WOLEDs have been used to realize an EQE exceeding 30%, thereby establishing a new benchmark in this field.

         <title>Molecular Oligothiophene&#8211;Fullerene Dyad Reaching Over 5% Efficiency in Single&#8208;Material Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel structurally defined and covalently linked donor&#8211;acceptor dyad 4 is implemented into single&#8208;material organic solar cells as the essential ambipolar and photoactive layer. The combination of an oligothiophene donor and PC71BM fullerene as acceptor not only leads to enhanced 5.34% power conversion efficiency, but also to impressive long&#8208;term stability after 750 hours (one month) of continuous illumination.








Abstract
A novel donor&#8211;acceptor dyad, 4, in which the conjugated oligothiophene donor is covalently connected to fullerene PC71BM by a flexible alkyl ester linker, is synthesized and applied as photoactive layer in solution&#8208;processed single&#8208;material organic solar cells (SMOSCs). Excellent photovoltaic performance, including a high short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC) of 13.56&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, is achieved, leading to a power conversion efficiency of 5.34% in an inverted cell architecture, which is substantially increased compared to other molecular single materials. Furthermore, dyad 4&#8208;based SMOSCs display excellent stability maintaining 96% of the initial performance after 750 h (one month) of continuous illumination and operation under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation. These results will strengthen the rational molecular design to further develop SMOSCs for potential industrial application.

Multiscale Organic Semiconductors
The intrinsic properties and devices performance of multiscale organic semiconductors can be regulated through chemical structure design and controlled self&#8208;assembly in a wide scale range from micro&#8208;molecule to aggregated structures.

Conformal Films
In article number 2106683, Kenjiro Fukuda, Takao Someya, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate how a variety of ultrathin, ultraflexible organic photovoltaics that differ in layout, active area, and active material can be laminated to glass spheres of different sizes using a thermally activated shrink film. The wrinkling pattern that occurs in these ultrathin sheets allows even nonstretchable devices to conform to surfaces with a 3D curvature.

Multiscale organic semiconductors (OSs) are widely used as active components in practical devices. The intrinsic properties of OSs can be regulated through chemical structure design and self&#8208;assembly process control.








Abstract
Currently, organic semiconductors (OSs) are widely used as active components in practical devices related to energy storage and conversion, optoelectronics, catalysis, and biological sensors, etc. To satisfy the actual requirements of different types of devices, chemical structure design and self&#8208;assembly process control have been synergistically performed. The morphology and other basic properties of multiscale OS components are governed on a broad scale from nanometers to macroscopic micrometers. Herein, the up&#8208;to&#8208;date design strategies for fabricating multiscale OSs are comprehensively reviewed. Related representative works are introduced, applications in practical devices are discussed, and future research directions are presented. Design strategies combining the advances in organic synthetic chemistry and supramolecular assembly technology perform an integral role in the development of a new generation of multiscale OSs.

         <title>Color&#8208;Tunable Supramolecular Luminescent Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular chemistry has provided a platform for the rational design of smart optical materials. Noncovalent bonding interactions, not only afford convenient and efficient approaches to fabricate emissive materials, but also endow them with dynamic reversibility and stimuli responsiveness. This review highlights the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art noncovalent strategies available for the construction of color&#8208;tunable luminescent materials.








Abstract
Constructing multicolor photoluminescent materials with tunable properties is an attractive research objective on account of their abundant applications in materials science and biomedical engineering. By comparison with covalent synthesis, supramolecular chemistry has provided a more competitive and promising strategy for the production of organic materials and the regulation of their photophysical properties. By taking advantage of dynamic and reversible noncovalent bonding interactions, supramolecular strategies can, not only simplify the design and fabrication of organic materials, but can also endow them with dynamic reversibility and stimuli responsiveness, making it much easier to adjust the superstructures and properties of the materials. Occasionally, it is possible to introduce emergent properties into these materials, which are absent in their precursor compounds, broadening their potential applications. In an attempt to highlight the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art noncovalent strategies available for the construction of smart luminescent materials, an overview of color&#8208;tunable materials is presented in this Review, with the emphasis being placed on the examples drawn from host&#8211;guest complexes, supramolecular assemblies and crystalline materials. The noncovalent synthesis of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent materials and the modulation of their luminescent properties are also described.

&lt;p&gt;Supramolecular chemistry has provided a platform for the rational design of smart optical materials. Noncovalent bonding interactions, not only afford convenient and efficient approaches to fabricate emissive materials, but also endow them with dynamic reversibility and stimuli responsiveness. This review highlights the state-of-the-art noncovalent strategies available for the construction of color-tunable luminescent materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constructing multicolor photoluminescent materials with tunable properties is an attractive research objective on account of their abundant applications in materials science and biomedical engineering. By comparison with covalent synthesis, supramolecular chemistry has provided a more competitive and promising strategy for the production of organic materials and the regulation of their photophysical properties. By taking advantage of dynamic and reversible noncovalent bonding interactions, supramolecular strategies can, not only simplify the design and fabrication of organic materials, but can also endow them with dynamic reversibility and stimuli responsiveness, making it much easier to adjust the superstructures and properties of the materials. Occasionally, it is possible to introduce emergent properties into these materials, which are absent in their precursor compounds, broadening their potential applications. In an attempt to highlight the state-of-the-art noncovalent strategies available for the construction of smart luminescent materials, an overview of color-tunable materials is presented in this Review, with the emphasis being placed on the examples drawn from host&#8211;guest complexes, supramolecular assemblies and crystalline materials. The noncovalent synthesis of room-temperature phosphorescent materials and the modulation of their luminescent properties are also described. Finally, future directions and scientific challenges in the emergent field of color-tunable supramolecular emissive materials are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Slip&#8208;Stacked J&#8208;Aggregate Materials for Organic Solar Cells and Photodetectors</title>

         <dc:description>
J&#8208; and H&#8208;aggregates constitute archetype functional materials due to unique properties originating from exciton coupling. Here, a broader perspective on the origin of red&#8208;shifted absorption bands including intermolecular charge transfer&#8208;mediated J&#8208;coupling is provided. Further, important classes of dye aggregates with regard to the prevailing intermolecular couplings and their relevance for organic solar cells and photodetectors are analyzed.








Abstract
Dye&#8211;dye interactions affect the optical and electronic properties in organic semiconductor films of light harvesting and detecting optoelectronic applications. This review elaborates how to tailor these properties of organic semiconductors for organic solar cells (OSCs) and organic photodiodes (OPDs). While these devices rely on similar materials, the demands for their optical properties are rather different, the former requiring a broad absorption spectrum spanning from the UV over visible up to the near&#8208;infrared region and the latter an ultra&#8208;narrow absorption spectrum at a specific, targeted wavelength. In order to design organic semiconductors satisfying these demands, fundamental insights on the relationship of optical properties are provided depending on molecular packing arrangement and the resultant electronic coupling thereof. Based on recent advancements in the theoretical understanding of intermolecular interactions between slip&#8208;stacked dyes, distinguishing classical J&#8208;aggregates with predominant long&#8208;range Coulomb coupling from charge transfer (CT)&#8208;mediated or &#8208;coupled J&#8208;aggregates, whose red&#8208;shifts are primarily governed by short&#8208;range orbital interactions, is suggested. Within this framework, the relationship between aggregate structure and functional properties of representative classes of dye aggregates is analyzed for the most advanced OSCs and wavelength&#8208;selective OPDs, providing important insights into the rational design of thin&#8208;film optoelectronic materials.

         <title>Structures and Materials in Stretchable Electroluminescent Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses the challenges in fabricating stretchable electroluminescent (EL) devices, with focus on providing a basic understanding of the materials meeting both the mechanical and electronic requirements and introducing important techniques to fabricate the devices. The developments of stretchable transparent electrodes and EL materials relevant to intrinsically stretchable EL devices are described in detail.








Abstract
Stretchable electroluminescent (EL) devices are obtained by partitioning a large emission area into areas specifically for stretching and light&#8208;emission (island&#8211;bridge structure). Buckled and textile structures are also shown effective to combine the conventional light emitting diode fabrication with elastic substrates for structure&#8208;enabled stretchable EL devices. Meanwhile, intrinsically stretchable EL devices which are characterized with uniform stretchability down to microscopic scale are relatively less developed but promise simpler device structure and higher impact resistance. The challenges in fabricating intrinsically stretchable EL devices with high and robust performance are in many facets, including stretchable conductors, emissive materials, and compatible processes. For the stretchable transparent electrode, ionically conductive gel, conductive polymer coating, and conductor network in surface of elastomer are all proven useful. The stretchable EL materials are currently limited to conjugated polymers, conjugated polymers with surfactants and ionic conductors added to boost stretchability, and phosphor particles embedded in elastomer matrices. These emissive materials operate under different mechanisms, require different electrode materials and fabrication processes, and the corresponding EL devices face distinctive challenges. This review aims to provide a basic understanding of the materials meeting both the mechanical and electronic requirements and important techniques to fabricate the stretchable EL devices.

         <title>Acceptor Modulation Strategies for Improving the Electron Transport in High&#8208;Performance Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review illustrates the significance of improving electron transport of semiconducting polymers. To improve the electron mobilities, acceptor modulation strategies are summarized and discussed. The introduction of electron&#8208;withdrawing groups into polymers is also involved. High&#8208;performance organic field&#8208;effect transistors are reviewed. The relationship between device performance and chemical structure, energy levels, molecular packing orientation, and processing condition is comprehensively discussed.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance ambipolar and electronic type semiconducting polymers are essential for fabricating various organic optoelectronic devices and complementary circuits. This review summarizes the strategies of improving the electron transport of semiconducting polymers via acceptor modulation strategies, which include the use of single, dual, triple, multiple, and all acceptors as well as the fusion of multiple identical acceptors to obtain new heterocyclic acceptors. To further improve the electron transport of semiconducting polymers, the introduction of strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups can enhance the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of donors and acceptors, thereby facilitating electron injection and suppressing hole accumulation. In addition, the relationships between the molecular structure, frontier molecular orbital energy levels, thin film morphology, microstructure, processing conditions, and device performances are also comprehensively discussed. Finally, the challenges encountered in this research area are proposed and the future outlook is presented.

         <dc:description>
In this review, the recent process of stimulus&#8208;responsive 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is summarized. The responsive behaviors and design strategies of these smart 2D COFs under physical or chemical stimuli are well described. Moreover, their applications in chemical sensors and photoelectronic devices are also discussed.








Abstract
Recently, smart 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs), combining the advantages of both inherent structure features and functional building blocks, have been demonstrated to show reversible changes in conformation, color, and luminescence in response to external stimuli. This review provides a summary on the recent progress of 2D COFs that are responsive to external stimuli such as metal ions, gas molecules, pH values, temperature, electricity, light, etc. Moreover, the responsive mechanisms and design strategies, along with the applications of these stimulus&#8208;responsive 2D COFs in chemical sensors and photoelectronic devices are also discussed. It is believed that this review would provide some guidelines for designing novel single&#8208;/multistimulus&#8208;responsive 2D COFs with controllable responsive behaviors for advanced photoelectronic applications.

         <title>Quinoxaline&#8208;Based D&#8211;A Copolymers for the Applications as Polymer Donor and Hole Transport Material in Polymer/Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>

Recent developments of the quinoxaline&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymers for the applications as polymer donor in polymer solar cells and as hole transport material in perovskite solar cells are reviewed.








Abstract
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have achieved great progress recently, benefiting from the rapid development of narrow bandgap small molecule acceptors and wide bandgap conjugated polymer donors. Among the polymer donors, the D&#8211;A copolymers with quinoxaline (Qx) as A&#8208;unit have received increasing attention since the report of the low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance D&#8211;A copolymer donor based on thiophene D&#8208;unit and difluoro&#8208;quinoxalline A&#8208;unit in 2018. In addition, the weak electron&#8208;deficient characteristic and the multiple substitution positions of the Qx unit make it an ideal A&#8208;unit in constructing the wide bandgap polymer donors with different functional substitutions. In this review article, recent developments of the Qx&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymer donors, including synthetic method of the Qx unit, backbone modulation, side chain optimization, and functional substitution of the Qx&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymers, are summarized and discussed. Furthermore, the application of the Qx&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymers as hole transport material in perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) is also introduced.

&lt;p&gt;Recent developments of the quinoxaline-based D&#8211;A copolymers for the applications as polymer donor in polymer solar cells and as hole transport material in perovskite solar cells are reviewed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have achieved great progress recently, benefiting from the rapid development of narrow bandgap small molecule acceptors and wide bandgap conjugated polymer donors. Among the polymer donors, the D&#8211;A copolymers with quinoxaline (Qx) as A-unit have received increasing attention since the report of the low-cost and high-performance D&#8211;A copolymer donor based on thiophene D-unit and difluoro-quinoxalline A-unit in 2018. In addition, the weak electron-deficient characteristic and the multiple substitution positions of the Qx unit make it an ideal A-unit in constructing the wide bandgap polymer donors with different functional substitutions. In this review article, recent developments of the Qx-based D&#8211;A copolymer donors, including synthetic method of the Qx unit, backbone modulation, side chain optimization, and functional substitution of the Qx-based D&#8211;A copolymers, are summarized and discussed. Furthermore, the application of the Qx-based D&#8211;A copolymers as hole transport material in perovskite solar cells (pero-SCs) is also introduced. The focus mainly on the molecular design strategies and structure&#8211;properties relationship of the Qx-based D&#8211;A copolymers, aiming to provide a guideline for developing high-performance Qx-based D&#8211;A copolymers for the applications as donor in PSCs and as hole transport material in pero-SCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Research Progress of Intramolecular &#960;&#8208;Stacked Small Molecules for Device Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike traditional covalent bond&#8208;connected conjugated molecules, &#960;&#8208;stacked small molecules have special advantages in organic semiconductors. This review mainly focuses on the research development of &#960;&#8208;stacked molecular systems and introduces the new characteristics brought by the special molecular configuration and its application in organic semiconductors.








Abstract
Organic semiconductors can be designed and constructed in &#960;&#8208;stacked structures instead of the conventional &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures. Through&#8208;space interaction (TSI) occurs in &#960;&#8208;stacked optoelectronic materials. Thus, unlike electronic coupling along the conjugated chain, the functional groups can stack closely to facilitate spatial electron communication. Using &#960;&#8208;stacked motifs, chemists and materials scientists can find new ways for constructing materials with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), as well as enhanced molecular conductance. Organic optoelectronic devices based on &#960;&#8208;stacked molecules have exhibited very promising performance, with some of them exceeding &#960;&#8208;conjugated analogues. Recently, reports on various organic &#960;&#8208;stacked structures have grown rapidly, prompting this review. Representative molecular scaffolds and newly developed &#960;&#8208;stacked systems could stimulate more attention on through&#8208;space charge transfer the well&#8208;known through&#8208;bond charge transfer. Finally, the opportunities and challenges for utilizing and improving particular materials are discussed. The previous achievements and upcoming prospects may provide new insights into the theory, materials, and devices in the field of organic semiconductors.

         <title>Influence of Oxidation on Structure, Performance, and Application of Metallic Glasses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent research concerning metallic glass oxidation is reviewed by summarizing metallic glass oxidation behaviors, how oxidation influences metallic glass structure and performance, and the possibilities and the feasibility of using controlled oxidation to reinforce metallic glasses or develop metallic glass systems.








Abstract
Owing to their unique structure and outstanding properties, metallic glasses are a novel class of structural and functional materials with vast application prospects. However, the metastable amorphous structures and chemical activity of metallic glass constituent elements lead to frequent oxidation during preparation, processing, and application. Comprehensively understanding the oxidation behaviors and underlying mechanisms of metallic glasses is essential for gaining knowledge of metallic glass structures and properties and for promoting engineering applications. Although many studies have examined these issues, more investigations are still required to explore potential industrial applications of metallic glasses. Here, recent research on metallic glass oxidation is consolidated by summarizing the oxidation influence on metallic glass structure, performance, and application and the possibilities and feasibility of oxidizing metallic glasses to reinforce materials or develop material systems are discussed.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Electron&#8208;Driving Observations of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 Photoreduction on Co&#8208;Doped CeO2/Crystalline Carbon Nitride S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic&#8208;level regulation of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions is designed by integrating Co&#8208;doped CeO2 nanoparticles with highly crystalline poly(triazine imide), of which the surface Co&#8208;embedded CeCo conjunction features functionalized Co species toward the boosted directional electron&#8208;driving effect from the carbon nitride donations to site&#8208;specific Co hubs, thus promoting electronic transferability for multiple electrons&#8208;involving CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 photoreduction.








Abstract
Photoexcited dynamic modulation, maximizing the effective utilization of photoinduced electron&#8211;hole pairs, dominates the multiple electrons&#8208;involving reduction pathways for terminal CH4 evolution during CO2 photoreduction. Yet, the site&#8208;specific regulation of directional charge transfer by modification of an S&#8208;scheme heterojunction has seldom been discussed. Herein, an atomic&#8208;level tailoring strategy by anchoring single&#8208;atomic Co into CeO2 co&#8208;catalyst rather than carbon nitride supports, which can selectively favor CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 photoreduction, is reported. Through in situ dynamic tracking investigations, this study identifies that surface Co&#8208;embedded bimetallic CeCo conjunction is the key feature driving a strong interconnection of dynamical charge states through S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions. The Co&#8208;embedded modification into CeO2 co&#8208;catalysts is demonstrated to have a critical effect on directional charge control, accelerating the driving of electrons from the carbon nitride donations to site&#8208;specific Co hubs, which thereby promotes electronic transferability for electrons&#8208;involving CH4 formation. As a result, an unprecedented CH4 yield (181.7&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1) is obtained with a high turnover number (411.4) through a fully gas&#8211;solid reaction, demonstrating its potential toward targeted CH4 formation without adding any sacrificial agent.

Abstract
Traditional electronic skin (e&#8208;skin), due to the lack of human brain&#8208;like thinking and judging capability, is powerless to accelerate the pace to the intelligent era. Herein, we propose an AI&#8208;motivated full&#8208;skin bionic (FSB) e&#8208;skin consisting of the structures of human vellus hair, epidermis&#8208;dermis&#8208;hypodermis. Benefiting from the double interlocked layered microcone structure and supercapacitive iontronic effect, the FSB e&#8208;skin exhibits ultra&#8208;high sensitivity of 8053.1 kPa&#8722;1 (&lt;1&#160;kPa), linear sensitivity of 3103.5 kPa&#8722;1 (1&#8208;34&#160;kPa), fast response/recovery time (&lt;5.6&#160;ms) and limit of detection (0.05&#160;Pa). In addition, it is also demonstrated it can realize the evolution from tactile perception to advanced intelligent tactile cognition after being equipped with a &#8220;brain&#8221;. Firstly, static/dynamic contactless tactile perception is achieved based on the triboelectric effect of the vellus hair bionics. Secondly, the supercapacitive iontronic effect based structural bionics of the epidermis&#8208;dermis&#8208;hypodermis and a 5&#8208;layer multilayer perception (MLP) enable the general intelligent tactile cognition of gesture cognition and robot interaction. Most importantly, by making full use of FSB e&#8208;skin with a 6&#8208;layer MLP neural network, we develop an advanced intelligent material cognition system for real&#8208;time cognition of the object material species and locations via one contact, which surpasses the capability of humans.

         <title>Diammonium mediated perovskite film formation for high&#8208;luminescence red perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes</title>

Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) mixed halide perovskite&#8208;based red emitters combine excellent charge transport characteristics with simple solution processing and good film formation; however, light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) based on these emitters cannot yet outperform their nanocrystal counterparts. Here we explored the use of diammonium halides in regulating the formation of mixed bromide&#8208;iodide perovskite films. We found that the diammonium cations preferentially bond to Pb&#8208;Br, rather than Pb&#8208;I, octahedra, promoting the formation of quasi&#8208;2D phases. We propose that the perovskite formation is initially dominated by the crystallization of the thermodynamically more favorable 3D phase, but, as the solution gets depleted from the regular A cations, thin shells of amorphous quasi&#8208;2D perovskites form. This leads to crystalline perovskite grains with efficiently passivated surfaces and reduced lattice strain. As a result, the diammonium treated perovskite LEDs demonstrate a record luminance (10745&#160;cd m&#8211;2) and half&#8208;lifetime among 3D perovskite&#8208;based red LEDs.

         <title>Designing rewritable dual&#8208;mode patterns using a stretchable photoresponsive polymer via orthogonal photopatterning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The fabrication of dual&#8208;mode patterns in the same region of a material is a promising approach for high&#8208;density information storage, new anti&#8208;counterfeiting technologies, and highly secure encryption. However, dual&#8208;mode patterns are difficult to achieve because the two patterns in one material may interfere with each other during fabrication and usage. The development of non&#8208;interfering dual&#8208;mode patterns requires new materials and patterning techniques. Herein, a novel orthogonal photopatterning technique is reported for the fabrication of non&#8208;interfering dual&#8208;mode patterns on an azopolymer P1. P1 is a unique material that exhibits both photo&#8208;induced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transitions and good stretchability. In the first step of orthogonal photopatterning, patterned photonic structures are fabricated on a P1 film via masked nanoimprinting controlled by photoinduced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transitions. In the second step, the P1 film is stretched and irradiated with polarized light through a photomask, which generates a chromatic polarization pattern. In particular, the photonic structures and chromatic polarization in the dual&#8208;mode pattern are noninterfering. Another feature of dual&#8208;mode patterns is that they are rewritable via photo, thermal, or solution reprocessing, which are useful for recycling and reprogramming. Our study opens an avenue for the development of novel materials and techniques for photopatterning.

         <title>Activated Ni&#8211;OH Bonds in a Catalyst Facilitates the Nucleophile Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nucleophile oxidation reaction (NOR) is a complex reaction including electrochemical step and spontaneous non&#8208;electrochemical process. The interlayer Pt nanosheets and multiple defects of Ni3Fe LDH&#8208;Pt NS enable the activated Ni2+&#8211;OH to exhibit an excellent NOR activity. More importantly, spontaneous non&#8208;electrochemical steps, including proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer, hydration, and rearrangement, lead to diverse nucleophile dehydrogenation oxidation pathways of different NOR systems.








Abstract
The nucleophile oxidation reaction (NOR) is of enormous significance for organic electrosynthesis and coupling for hydrogen generation. However, the nonuniform NOR mechanism limits its development. For the NOR, involving electrocatalysis and organic chemistry, both the electrochemical step and non&#8208;electrochemical process should be taken into account. The NOR of nickel&#8208;based hydroxides includes the electrogenerated dehydrogenation of the Ni2+&#8211;OH bond and a spontaneous non&#8208;electrochemical process; the former determines the electrochemical activity, and the nucleophile oxidation pathway depends on the latter. Herein, the space&#8208;confinement&#8208;induced synthesis of Ni3Fe layered double hydroxide intercalated with single&#8208;atom&#8208;layer Pt nanosheets (Ni3Fe LDH&#8208;Pt NS) is reported. The synergy of interlayer Pt nanosheets and multiple defects activates Ni&#8211;OH bonds, thus exhibiting an excellent NOR performance. The spontaneous non&#8208;electrochemical steps of the NOR are revealed, such as proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET; Ni3+&#8211;O + X&#8211;H = Ni2+&#8211;OH + X&#8226;), hydration, and rearrangement. Hence, the reaction pathway of the NOR is deciphered, which not only helps to perfect the NOR mechanism, but also provides inspiration for organic electrosynthesis.

         <title>Visualizing Atomically Layered Magnetism in CrSBr</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CrSBr is a layered material possessing intralayer ferromagnetic and interlayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering at low temperatures (T&#160;&lt;&#160;132&#160;K). At higher temperatures or in the presence of modest magnetic fields, AFM correlations are suppressed, yielding a magnetic phase with a comparatively high sheet susceptibility (&#967;2D). Magnetic force microscopy is sensitive to &#967;2D and identifies local nanoscale magnetic ordering.








Abstract
2D materials can host long&#8208;range magnetic order in the presence of underlying magnetic anisotropy. The ability to realize the full potential of 2D magnets necessitates systematic investigation of the role of individual atomic layers and nanoscale inhomogeneity (i.e., strain) on the emergence of stable magnetic phases. Here, spatially dependent magnetism in few&#8208;layer CrSBr is revealed using magnetic force microscopy (MFM) and Monte Carlo&#8208;based simulations. Nanoscale visualization of the magnetic sheet susceptibility is extracted from MFM data and force&#8211;distance curves, revealing a characteristic onset of both intra&#8208; and interlayer magnetic correlations as a function of temperature and layer&#8208;thickness. These results demonstrate that the presence of a single uncompensated layer in odd&#8208;layer terraces significantly reduces the stability of the low&#8208;temperature antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase and gives rise to multiple coexisting magnetic ground states at temperatures close to the bulk N&#233;el temperature (TN). Furthermore, the AFM phase can be reliably suppressed using modest fields (&#8776;16 mT) from the MFM probe, behaving as a nanoscale magnetic switch. This prototypical study of few&#8208;layer CrSBr demonstrates the critical role of layer parity on field&#8208;tunable 2D magnetism and validates MFM for use in nanomagnetometry of 2D materials (despite the ubiquitous absence of bulk zero&#8208;field magnetism in magnetized sheets).

         <title>Electrochemical Construction of Edge&#8208;Contacted Metal&#8208;Semiconductor Junctions with Low Contact Barrier</title>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconductors, such as MoS2 have emerged as promising ultrathin channel materials for the further scaling of field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). However, the contact barrier at the metal&#8208;2D semiconductor junctions still significantly limits the device performance. By extending the application of electrochemical deposition in 2D electronics, we developed a distinct approach for constructing metal&#8208;2D semiconductor junctions in an edge&#8208;contacted configuration through the edge guided electrodeposition of varied metals. Both high resolution microscopic imaging and electrical transport measurements confirmed the successful creation of high quality Pd&#8208;2D MoS2 junctions in desired geometry by combining electrodepostion with lithographic patterning. We further fabricated FETs on the obtained Pd&#8208;2D MoS2 junctions and confirmed that these junctions exhibited reduced contact barrier of &#8764;20 meV and extremely low contact resistance of 290 &#937;&#183;&#956;m and thus increased the averaged mobility of MoS2 FETs to &#8764;108 cm2V&#8211;1s&#8211;1. Our approach paves a new way for the construction of metal&#8208;semiconductor junctions and also demonstrates the great potential of electrochemical deposition technique in 2D electronics.

         <title>Cell&#8208;in&#8208;Catalytic&#8208;Shell Nanoarchitectonics: Catalytic Empowerment of Individual Living Cells by Single&#8208;Cell Nanoencapsulation</title>

Abstract
Cell&#8208;in&#8208;shell biohybrid structures, synthesized by encapsulating individual living cells with exogenous materials, have emerged as exciting functional entities for engineered living materials, with emergent properties outside the scope of biochemical modifications. Artificial exoskeletons have, up to date, provided physicochemical shelters to the cells inside in the first stage of technological development, and further advances in the field demand catalytically empowered, cellular hybrid systems that augment the biological functions of cells and even introduce completely new functions to the cells. This work describes a facile and generalizable strategy for empowering living cells with extrinsic catalytic capability through nanoencapsulation of living cells with supramolecular metal&#8208;organic complex of Fe3+ and benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxylic acid (BTC). A series of enzymes are embedded in situ, without loss of catalytic activity, in the Fe3+&#8208;BTC shells, not to mention the superior characteristics of cytocompatible and rapid shell&#8208;forming processes. The nanoshell enhances the catalytic efficiency of multienzymatic cascade reactions by confining reaction intermediates to its internal voids, and the nanoencapsulated cells acquire exogenous biochemical functions, including enzymatic cleavage of lethal octyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucopyranoside into d&#8208;glucose, with autonomous cytoprotection. Our system will provide a versatile, nanoarchitectonic tool for interfacing biological cells with functional materials, especially for catalytic bioempowerment of living cells.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;driven Self&#8208;healing of Metal Oxides Assisted By Polymer&#8208;inorganic Hybrid Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Enabling self&#8208;healing of materials is crucially important for saving resources and energy in numerous emerging applications. While strategies for the self&#8208;healing of polymers are advanced, mechanisms for semiconducting inorganic materials are scarce due to the lack of suitable healing agents. Here we have developed a concept for the self&#8208;healing of metal oxides. This concept consists of metal oxide nanoparticle growth inside the bulk of halogenated polymers and their subsequent entropy&#8208;driven migration to externally induced defect sites, leading to recovery of the defect. Herein we demonstrate that the pool of self&#8208;healing materials has been expanded to include semiconductors, thereby increasing the reliability and sustainability of functional materials through the use of metal oxides. We revealed that electrical properties of ITO can be partially restored upon healing. Such properties are of immediate interest for the further development of transparent flexible electrodes.

         <title>Single&#8208;Layer&#8208;Particle Electrode Design for Practical Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Efforts to enable fast charging and high energy density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) are hampered by the trade&#8208;off nature of the traditional electrode design: increasing the areal capacity usually comes with sacrificing the fast charge transfer. Here we report a single&#8208;layer chunky particle electrode design, where red phosphorus active material is embedded in nanochannels of vertically aligned graphene (red P/VAG) assemblies. Such electrode design addresses the sluggish charge transfer stemming from the high tortuosity and inner particle/electrode resistance of traditional electrode architectures consisting of randomly stacked active particles. The vertical ion transport nanochannels and electron transfer conductive nanowalls of graphene confine the direction of charge transfer to minimize the transfer distance, and the incomplete filling of nanochannels in the red P/VAG composite buffers volume change locally, thus avoiding the variation of electrodes thickness during cycling. The single&#8208;layer chunky particle electrode displays a high areal capacity (5.6 mAh cm&#8211;2), which was the highest among the reported fast&#8208;charging battery chemistries. Paired with a high&#8208;loading LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622) cathode, a pouch cell showed stable cycling with high energy density (405&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1, 1040&#160;Wh L&#8211;1), and power density (1224 W kg&#8211;1 and 3137 W L&#8211;1 at 6 C, 30&#160;mA cm&#8211;2). Such single&#8208;layer chunky particle electrode design with inner vertical charge transport pathways can be extended to other advanced battery systems and boost the development of LIBs with fast&#8208;charging capability and high energy density.

Abstract
Traditional alternating&#8208;current&#8208;driven electroluminescent (AC&#8208;EL) devices adopting a sandwich structure are commonly used in solid&#8208;state lighting and displays, while the emerging coplanar&#8208;electrode alternating&#8208;current&#8208;driven light&#8208;emitting variants manifest excellent application prospects in intelligent, multifunctional and full&#8208;color displays, and sensing purposes. Here, an asymmetrically&#8208;enhanced coplanar&#8208;electrode alternating&#8208;current&#8208;driven electroluminescent (AECE AC&#8208;EL) device with a universal and straightforward architecture is designed based on the impedance adjustment strategy. This newly devised asymmetric structure extends the functionalities of the coplanar&#8208;electrode AC&#8208;EL devices by overcoming the bottlenecks of complicated patterning procedures and high driving voltages of symmetric configuration. The developed device design enables a new type of information encryption and ultra&#8208;high stretchable patterned displays. Notably, the novel encryption appliances demonstrate feasible encryption/decryption features, multiple encryptions, and practical applicability; the biaxially&#8208;stretchable display devices achieve the highest tensile performance in the field of stretchable electroluminescent pattern displays, and outperforms the ultrahigh stretchable sandwich devices in terms of simple patterning process, higher brightness, wider color gamut and long&#8208;term stability. The proposed configuration opens up new avenues for AC&#8208;EL devices towards a plethora of smart applications in wearable electronics with intelligent displays, dynamic interaction of human&#8208;machine interface, and soft robotics.

         <title>Highly Curved, Quasi&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystalline Mesoporous Metal Nanoplates Promote C&#8212;C Bond Cleavage in Ethanol Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>

Abstract
The ability to manipulate metal nanocrystals with well&#8208;defined morphologies and structures is greatly important in material chemistry, catalysis chemistry, nanoscience and nanotechnology. Although two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metals serve as interesting platforms, further manipulating them in solution with highly penetrated mesopores and ideal crystallinity remains a huge challenge. Here, we report an easy yet powerful synthesis strategy to manipulating mesoporous structure and crystallinity of 2D metals in a controlled manner with cetyltrimethylammonium chloride as the mesopore&#8208;forming surfactant and extra iodine ion as the structure/facet&#8208;selective agent. This strategy allows for preparing an unprecedented type of 2D quasi&#8208;single&#8208;crystalline mesoporous nanoplates (SMPs) with highly curved morphology and controlled metal composition. The products, for example PdCu SMPs, feature abundant undercoordinated sites, optimized electronic structures, excellent electron/mass transfers, and confined mesopore environments. Curved PdCu SMPs exhibit remarkable electrocatalytic activity of 6.09 A mgPd&#8722;1 and stability for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) compared with its counterpart catalysts and commercial Pd/C. More importantly, PdCu SMPs are highly selective for EOR electrocatalysis that dramatically promotes the C&#8212;C bond cleavage with a superior C1 pathway selectivity as high as 72.1%. The findings in this work may put forward new insight into producing a new family of 2D and/or mesoporous metals with fascinating physicochemical properties for various targeted applications.

Abstract
Regulating surface strain of nanomaterials is an effective strategy to manipulate the activity of catalysts, yet not well recognized in the rechargeable Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. Herein, biaxially compressive strained nickel/ruthenium core/shell hexagonal nanoplates (Ni/Ru HNPs) with lattice compression of &#8764;5.1% and &#8764;3.2% in the Ru {10&#8208;10} and (0002) facets are developed as advanced catalysts for Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. We demonstrate that tuning the electronic structure of Ru shell through biaxially compressive strain engineering can boost the kinetically sluggish CO2 reduction and evolution reactions, thus achieving a high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;CO2 battery with low charge platform/overpotential (3.75&#160;V/0.88&#160;V) and ultralong cycling life (120 cycles at 200&#160;mA g&#8211;1 with a fixed capacity of 1000 mAh g&#8211;1). Density functional theory calculations reveal that the biaxially compressive strain can downshift the d&#8208;band center of surface Ru atoms and thus weaken the binding of CO2 molecules, which is energetically beneficial for the nucleation and decomposition of Li2CO3 crystals during the discharge and charge processes. Our study confirms that strain engineering though constructing the well&#8208;defined core/shell structure is a promising strategy to improve the inherent catalytic activity of Ru&#8208;based materials in Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.

Abstract
Cancer&#8208;targeting ligands used for nanomedicines have been limited to mostly antibodies, peptides, aptamers, and small molecules thus far. Here we report a library of glycocalyx&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles as a platform enabling screening and identification of cancer&#8208;targeting nanomedicines. Specifically, a library of 31 artificial glycopolymers composed of either homogeneous or heterogeneous display of five different sugar moieties (&#946;&#8208;Glc, &#946;&#8208;Gal, &#945;&#8208;Man, &#946;&#8208;GlcNAc, and &#946;&#8208;GalNAc) was converted to a library of glyconanoparticles (GlyNPs). We systematically screened and identified GlyNPs optimal for targeting CT26, DU145, A549, and PC3 tumors. The cypate&#8208;conjugated GlyNP displaying &#945;&#8208;Man and &#946;&#8208;GlcNAc showed selective targeting and potent photothermal therapeutic efficacy against A549 human lung tumors. The docetaxel&#8208;contained GlyNP displaying &#946;&#8208;Glc, &#946;&#8208;Gal, and &#945;&#8208;Man demonstrated targeted chemotherapy against DU145 human prostate tumors. The results presented herein collectively demonstrated that the GlyNP library is a versatile platform enabling the identification of cancer&#8208;targeting glyconanoparticles and suggested its potential applicability for targeting various diseased cells beyond cancer.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Driven Auto&#8208;Detachable Patterning of Flexible Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Flexible electrodes that are multilayer, multi&#8208;material and conformal are pivotal for multifunctional wearable electronics. Traditional electronic circuits manufacturing requires substrate&#8208;supported transfer printing, which limits their multilayer integrity and device conformability on arbitrary surfaces. Herein, we report a SHrinkage&#8208;Assisted Patterning by Evaporation (SHAPE) method, by employing evaporation&#8208;induced interfacial strain mismatch, to fabricate auto&#8208;detachable, freestanding, and patternable electrodes. The SHAPE method utilizes vacuum&#8208;filtration of polyaniline/bacterial cellulose (PANI/BC) ink through a masked filtration membrane to print high&#8208;resolution, patterned, and multilayer electrodes. The strong inter&#8208;layer hydrogen bonding ensures robust multilayer integrity, while the controllable evaporative shrinking property of PANI/BC induces mismatch between the strains of the electrode and filtration membrane at the interface and thus autodetachment of electrodes. Notably, a 500&#8208;layer substrateless microsupercapacitor fabricated using the SHAPE method exhibits an energy density of 350 mWh cm&#8722;2 at a power density of 40&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, 100 times higher than reported substrate&#8208;confined counterparts. Moreover, a digital circuit fabricated using the SHAPE method functioned stably on a deformed glove, highlighting the broad wearable applications of the SHAPE method.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Assembled 3D Penetrating Nanonetwork for High&#8208;Performance Intrinsically Stretchable Polymer Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled 3D penetrating nanonetwork tactic is developed based on high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight phenylenevinylene (L&#8208;SY&#8208;PPV) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) to achieve increased stretchability and charge transportability simultaneously for blended emissive films. The obtained intrinsically stretchable polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibit low turn&#8208;on voltage (6.5 V) and high luminescence (over 3780 cd m&#8211;2), simultaneously.








Abstract
The emergence of wearable technology can significantly benefit from electronic displays fabricated using intrinsically stretchable (is&#8208;) materials. Typically, an improvement in the stretchability of conventional light&#8208;emitting polymers is accompanied by a decrease in charge transportability, thus resulting in a significant decrease in device efficiency. In this study, a self&#8208;assembled 3D penetrating nanonetwork is developed to achieve increased stretchability and mobility simultaneously, based on high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight phenylenevinylene (L&#8208;SY&#8208;PPV) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN). The mobility of L&#8208;SY&#8208;PPV/PAN increases by 5&#8211;6 times and the stretchability increases from 20% (pristine L&#8208;SY&#8208;PPV film) to 100%. A high current efficiency (CE) of 8.13&#160;cd A&#8722;1 is observed in polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) fabricated using 40% stretched L&#8208;SY&#8208;PPV/PAN. Furthermore, using a polyethyleneimine ethoxylated (PEIE), an 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline monohydrate (pBphen), and a reduced Triton X&#8208;100 (TR) chelated Zn&#8208;based is&#8208; electron&#8208;injection layer of Zn&#8208;PEIE&#8208;pBphen&#8208;TR, an is&#8208;PLED is realized with a turn&#8208;on voltage of 6.5&#160;V and a high CE of 2.35&#160;cd A&#8722;1. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of using the self&#8208;assembled 3D penetrating nanonetwork for the fabrication of is&#8208;PLEDs.

         <title>Submolecular Ligand Size and Spacing for Cell Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Submolecular tuning of ligand size and spacing is demonstrated via template&#8208;mediated in situ growth of nanoparticles. It is revealed that submolecular ligand spacing stimulates integrin binding to facilitate the adhesion&#8208;mediated pro&#8208;regenerative polarization of macrophages. Increasing ligand spacing only significantly inhibits macrophage adhesion, whereas increasing both ligand size and spacing slightly hinders macrophage adhesion.








Abstract
Cell adhesion occurs when integrin recognizes and binds to Arg&#8211;Gly&#8211;Asp (RGD) ligands present in fibronectin. In this work, submolecular ligand size and spacing are tuned via template&#8208;mediated in situ growth of nanoparticles for dynamic macrophage modulation. To tune liganded gold nanoparticle (GNP) size and spacing from 3 to 20&#160;nm, in situ localized assemblies of GNP arrays on nanomagnetite templates are engineered. 3&#160;nm&#8208;spaced ligands stimulate the binding of integrin, which mediates macrophage&#8208;adhesion&#8208;assisted pro&#8208;regenerative polarization as compared to 20&#160;nm&#8208;spaced ligands, which can be dynamically anchored to the substrate for stabilizing integrin binding and facilitating dynamic macrophage adhesion. Increasing the ligand size from 7 to 20&#160;nm only slightly promotes macrophage adhesion, not observed with 13&#160;nm&#8208;sized ligands. Increasing the ligand spacing from 3 to 17&#160;nm significantly hinders macrophage adhesion that induces inflammatory polarization. Submolecular tuning of ligand spacing can dominantly modulate host macrophages.

A nanococktail therapeutic strategy is proposed to treat epidermal growth factor receptor&#8208;tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR&#8208;TKI)&#8208;resistant non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by employing stimuli&#8208;responsive block&#8208;dendritic&#8208;polymer&#8208;based nanoparticles for targeted co&#8208;delivery of gefitinib and Yes&#8208;associated protein (YAP)&#8208;siRNA. The nanosystem can block the EGFR signaling pathway with gefitinib, inhibit the EGFR bypass signaling pathway via YAP&#8208;siRNA, and induce tumor cell apoptosis by photodynamic therapy.








Abstract
Yes&#8208;associated protein (YAP) has been identified as a key driver for epidermal growth factor receptor&#8208;tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR&#8208;TKI) resistance. Inhibition of YAP expression could be a potential therapeutic option for treating non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Herein, a nanococktail therapeutic strategy is proposed by employing amphiphilic and block&#8208;dendritic&#8208;polymer&#8208;based nanoparticles (NPs) for targeted co&#8208;delivery of EGFR&#8208;TKI gefitinib (Gef) and YAP&#8208;siRNA to achieve a targeted drug/gene/photodynamic therapy. The resulting NPs are effectively internalized into Gef&#8208;resistant NSCLC cells, successfully escape from late endosomes/lysosomes, and responsively release Gef and YAP&#8208;siRNA in an intracellular reductive environment. They preferentially accumulate at the tumor site after intravenous injection in both cell&#8208;line&#8208;derived xenograft (CDX) and patient&#8208;derived xenograft (PDX) models of Gef&#8208;resistant NSCLC, resulting in potent antitumor efficacy without distinct toxicity after laser irradiation. Mechanism studies reveal that the cocktail therapy could block the EGFR signaling pathway with Gef, inhibit activation of the EGFR bypass signaling pathway via YAP&#8208;siRNA, and induce tumor cell apoptosis through photodynamic therapy (PDT). Furthermore, this combination nanomedicine can sensitize PDT and impair glycolysis by downregulating HIF&#8208;1&#945;. These results suggest that this stimuli&#8208;responsive dendritic&#8208;polymer&#8208;based nanococktail therapy may provide a promising approach for the treatment of EGFR&#8208;TKI resistant NSCLC.

         <title>Local Coordination Regulation through Tuning Atomic&#8208;Scale Cavities of Pd Metallene toward Efficient Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic&#8208;scale cavities of ultrathin (111)&#8208;exposed Pd metallene, which can increase coordination number and result in moderate downshifting of the d&#8208;band center, are proposed as a new active site for boosting oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysis.








Abstract
Moderate adsorption of oxygenated intermediates takes a significant role in rational design of high&#8208;efficiency oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts. Long&#8208;serving as a reliable strategy to tune geometric structure of nanomaterials, defect engineering enjoys the great ability of adjusting the coordination environment of catalytic active sites, which enables dominant regulation of adsorption energy and kinetics of ORR catalysis. However, limited to controllable nanocrystals fabrication, inducing uniformly dispersed high&#8208;coordinated defects into ultrathin 2D nanosheets remains challenging. Herein, atomic&#8208;scale cavities (ASCs) are proposed as a new kind of high&#8208;coordinated active site and successfully introduced into suprathin Pd (111)&#8208;exposed metallene. Due to its atomic concave architecture, leading to elevated CN and moderately downshifted d&#8208;band center, the as&#8208;made Pd metallene with ASCs (c&#8208;Pd M) exhibits excellent ORR performance with mass activity of 2.76 A mgPd&#8722;1 at 0.9&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and half&#8208;wave potential as high as 0.947&#160;V, which is 18.9 (2.7) times higher and 104 (46) mV larger than that of commercial Pt/C (Pd metallene without ASCs). Besides, the durability of c&#8208;Pd M exceeds its commercial counterpart with &#8776;30% loss after 5000 cycles. This work highlights a new&#8208;style mentality of designing fancy active sites toward efficient ORR electrocatalysis.

         <title>CsPbCl3&#8208;Cluster&#8208;Widened Bandgap and Inhibited Phase Segregation in a Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite and its Application to NiOx&#8208;Based Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title>

The bandgap of Cs0.22FA0.78Pb (I0.85Br0.15)3 is widened from 1.64 to 1.67 eV by adding 3 mol% CsPbCl3&#8208;clusters. Adding extra 2 mol% CsCl can enrich Cl at the NiOx/perovskite interface, thereby preventing the redox reaction at the interface and improving the photostability of the wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite. This enables efficient p&#8211;i&#8211;n&#8208;type NiOx&#8208;based perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with PCE up to 27.26%.








Abstract
Nickel oxide (NiOx) is an attractive hole&#8208;transport material for efficient and stable p&#8211;i&#8211;n metal&#8208;halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, an undesirable redox reaction occurs at the NiOx/perovskite interface, which results in a low open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC), instability, and phase separation of the NiOx&#8208;based wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite (Br &gt; 20%). In order to simultaneously address the abovementioned phase separation problem and redox chemistry at the perovskite/NiOx interface, the bandgap is widened from 1.64 to 1.67 eV by adding inorganic CsPbCl3&#8208;clusters (3 mol%) to the Cs22Br15 perovskite precursor solution. Moreover, adding extra 2 mol% CsCl enriches the NiOx/perovskite interface with Cl, thereby preventing the redox reaction at the interface, while controlling the Br content to within 15% improves the photostability of the wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a single&#8208;junction p&#8211;i&#8211;n PSC increases from 17.82% to 19.76%, which leads to the fabrication of highly efficient monolithic p&#8211;i&#8211;n&#8208;type NiOx&#8208;based perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with PCEs of up to 27.26% (certified PCE: 27.15%). The perovskite to an n&#8211;i&#8211;p&#8208;type perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell is also applied to deliver a VOC of 1.93 V and a final efficiency of 25.5%. These findings provide critical insight into the fabrication of highly efficient and stable wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites.

         <title>Ge Bidirectional Diffusion to Simultaneously Engineer Back Interface and Bulk Defects in the Absorber for Efficient CZTSSe Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ge bidirectional diffusion, simultaneously toward the Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) absorber and MoSe2 at the back interface, is realized by an easy&#8208;handling method. The crystal growth of the absorbers is regulated and the work function of MoSe2 is enhanced as well. Up to 13.14% efficiency is achieved for Ge&#8208;involved CZTSSe solar cells, which present a certified efficiency of 12.8%.








Abstract
Aiming at a large open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficit in Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) solar cells, a new and effective strategy to simultaneously regulate the back interface and restrain bulk defects of CZTSSe absorbers is developed by directly introducing a thin GeO2 layer on Mo substrates. Power conversion efficiency (power&#8208;to&#8208;efficiency) as high as 13.14% with a VOC of 547&#160;mV is achieved for the champion device, which presents a certified efficiency of 12.8% (aperture area: 0.25667 cm2). Further investigation reveals that Ge bidirectional diffusion simultaneously occurs toward the CZTSSe absorber and MoSe2 layer at the back interface while being selenized. That is, some Ge element from the GeO2 diffuses into the CZTSSe absorber layer to afford Ge&#8208;doped absorbers, which can significantly reduce the defect density and band tailing, and facilitate quasi&#8208;Fermi level split by relatively higher hole concentration. Meanwhile, a small amount of Ge element also participates in the formation of MoSe2 at the back interface, thus enhancing the work function of MoSe2 and effectively separating photoinduced carriers. This work highlights the synergistic effect of Ge element toward the bulk absorber and the back interface and also provides an easy&#8208;handling way to achieve high&#8208;performance CZTSSe solar cells.

&lt;p&gt;Ge bidirectional diffusion, simultaneously toward the Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZnSn(S,Se)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (CZTSSe) absorber and MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at the back interface, is realized by an easy-handling method. The crystal growth of the absorbers is regulated and the work function of MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is enhanced as well. Up to 13.14% efficiency is achieved for Ge-involved CZTSSe solar cells, which present a certified efficiency of 12.8%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aiming at a large open-circuit voltage (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;) deficit in Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZnSn(S,Se)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (CZTSSe) solar cells, a new and effective strategy to simultaneously regulate the back interface and restrain bulk defects of CZTSSe absorbers is developed by directly introducing a thin GeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer on Mo substrates. Power conversion efficiency (power-to-efficiency) as high as 13.14% with a &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; of 547&#160;mV is achieved for the champion device, which presents a certified efficiency of 12.8% (aperture area: 0.25667 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Further investigation reveals that Ge bidirectional diffusion simultaneously occurs toward the CZTSSe absorber and MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer at the back interface while being selenized. That is, some Ge element from the GeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; diffuses into the CZTSSe absorber layer to afford Ge-doped absorbers, which can significantly reduce the defect density and band tailing, and facilitate quasi-Fermi level split by relatively higher hole concentration. Meanwhile, a small amount of Ge element also participates in the formation of MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at the back interface, thus enhancing the work function of MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and effectively separating photoinduced carriers.

         <title>Biaxially Strained MoS2 Nanoshells with Controllable Layers Boost Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of biaxial strain and layer numbers of MoS2 nanoshells on the electrocatalytic activity is investigated in detail. Calculations reveal the superiority of biaxial strain over uniaxial strain and identify the ideal Mo coordination and S vacancies for maximal catalytic activity.








Abstract
Strain in layered transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is a type of effective approach to enhance the catalytic performance by activating their inert basal plane. However, compared with traditional uniaxial strain, the influence of biaxial strain and the TMD layer number on the local electronic configuration remains unexplored. Herein, via a new in situ self&#8208;vulcanization strategy, biaxially strained MoS2 nanoshells in the form of a single&#8208;crystalline Ni3S2@MoS2 core&#8211;shell heterostructure are realized, where the MoS2 layer is precisely controlled between the 1 and 5 layers. In particular, an electrode with the bilayer MoS2 nanoshells shows a remarkable hydrogen evolution reaction activity with a small overpotential of 78.1&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8208;2, and negligible activity degradation after durability testing. Density functional theory calculations reveal the contribution of the optimized biaxial strain together with the induced sulfur vacancies and identify the origin of superior catalytic sites in these biaxially strained MoS2 nanoshells. This work highlights the importance of the atomic&#8208;scale layer number and multiaxial strain in unlocking the potential of 2D TMD electrocatalysts.

         <title>Engineering DNA&#8208;Guided Hydroxyapatite Bulk Materials with High Stiffness and Outstanding Antimicrobial Ability for Dental Inlay Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrastiff DNA&#8211;hydroxyapatite bulk composites are fabricated by in situ mineralization in a long&#8208;range ordered DNA scaffold. The as&#8208;prepared composites exhibit an ultrahigh Young's modulus and a long&#8208;lasting and local antibacterial behavior. A new type of artificial dental inlay with outstanding antibacterial ability is thus developed for dental restoration applications.








Abstract
Programmable base pair interactions at the nanoscale make DNA an attractive scaffold for forming hydroxyapatite (HAP) nanostructures. However, engineering macroscale HAP mineralization guided by DNA molecules remains challenging. To overcome this issue, a facile strategy is developed for the fabrication of ultrastiff DNA&#8211;HAP bulk composites. The electrostatic complexation of DNA and a surfactant with a quaternary ammonium salt group enables the formation of long&#8208;range ordered scaffolds using electrospinning. The growth of 1D and 2D HAP minerals is thus realized by this DNA template at a macroscale. Remarkably, the as&#8208;prepared DNA&#8211;HAP composites exhibit an ultrahigh Young's modulus of &#8776;25&#160;GPa, which is comparable to natural HAP and superior to most artificial mineralized composites. Furthermore, a&#160;new type of dental inlay with outstanding antibacterial properties is developed using the stiff DNA&#8211;HAP. The encapsulated quaternary ammonium group within the dense HAP endows the composite with long&#8208;lasting and local antibacterial activity. Therefore, this new type of super&#8208;stiff biomaterial holds great potential for oral prosthetic applications.

         <title>More Powerful Twistron Carbon Nanotube Yarn Mechanical Energy Harvesters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
More powerful twistron carbon nanotube yarn mechanical energy harvesters are achieved by mechanically and thermally modifying the fundamental structure of twistrons and by incorporating graphene sheets within twistrons. The energy conversion efficiency of the twistrons can be increased over 7&#8208;fold and the peak power output can reach values that are 12&#8208;fold those reported for previous materials&#8208;based technologies for key frequency ranges.








Abstract
Stretching a coiled carbon nanotube (CNT) yarn can provide large, reversible electrochemical capacitance changes, which convert mechanical energy to electricity. Here, it is shown that the performance of these &#8220;twistron&#8221; harvesters can be increased by optimizing the alignment of precursor CNT forests, plastically stretching the precursor twisted yarn, applying much higher tensile loads during precoiling twist than for coiling, using electrothermal pulse annealing under tension, and incorporating reduced graphene oxide nanoplates. The peak output power for a 1 and a 30&#160;Hz sinusoidal deformation are 0.73 and 3.19&#160;kW&#160;kg&#8722;1, respectively, which are 24&#8208; and 13&#8208;fold that of previous twistron harvesters at these respective frequencies. This performance at 30&#160;Hz is over 12&#8208;fold that of other prior&#8208;art mechanical energy harvesters for frequencies between 0.1 and 600&#160;Hz. The maximum energy conversion efficiency is 7.2&#8208;fold that for previous twistrons. Twistron anode and cathode yarn arrays are stretched 180&#176; out&#8208;of&#8208;phase by locating them in the negative and positive compressibility directions of hinged wine&#8208;rack frames, thereby doubling the output voltage and reducing the input mechanical energy.

         <title>Nanochitin and Nanochitosan: Chitin Nanostructure Engineering with Multiscale Properties for Biomedical and Environmental Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanochitin and nanochitosan (with random copolymer&#8208;based multiscale architectures of glucosamine and N&#8208;acetylglucosamine units) have recently attracted immense attention for the development of green, sustainable, and advanced functional materials. Nanochitin and nanochitosan are multiscale materials from small oligomers, rod&#8208;shaped nanocrystals, longer nanofibers, to hierarchical assemblies of nanofibers. Various physical properties of chitin and chitosan depend on their molecular&#8208; and nano&#8208;structures; translational research has utilized them for a wide range of applications (biomedical, industrial, environmental, and so on). Instead of reviewing the entire extensive literature on chitin and chitosan, this paper highlights recent developments in multiscale&#8208;dependent material properties and their applications; immune, medical, reinforcing, adhesive, green electrochemical materials, biological scaffolds, and sustainable food packaging have been discussed considering the size, shape, and assembly of chitin nanostructures. In summary, new perspectives for the development of sustainable advanced functional materials based on nanochitin and nanochitosan by understanding and engineering their multiscale properties are described.

         <title>Metasurface&#8208;Enhanced Infrared Spectroscopy: An Abundance of Materials and Functionalities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Infrared (IR) spectroscopy provides unique information on the composition and dynamics of biochemical systems by resolving the characteristic absorption fingerprints of their constituent molecules. Based on this inherent chemical specificity and the capability for label&#8208;free, non&#8208;invasive, and real&#8208;time detection, IR spectroscopy approaches have unlocked a plethora of breakthrough application perspectives for fields ranging from environmental monitoring and defense to chemical analysis and medical diagnostics. Nanophotonics has played a crucial role for pushing the sensitivity limits of traditional far&#8208;field spectroscopy by using resonant nanostructures to focus the incident light into nanoscale hot&#8208;spots of the electromagnetic field, greatly enhancing light&#8208;matter interaction. Metasurfaces composed of regular arrangements of such resonators further increase the design space for tailoring this nanoscale light control both spectrally and spatially, which has established them as an invaluable toolkit for surface&#8208;enhanced spectroscopy. Starting from the fundamental concepts of metasurface&#8208;enhanced IR spectroscopy, we showcase a broad palette of resonator geometries, materials and arrangements for realizing highly sensitive metadevices, with a special focus on emerging systems such as phononic and 2D van der Waals materials, and integration with waveguides for lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip devices. Furthermore, we will highlight some advanced sensor functionalities of metasurface&#8208;based IR spectroscopy, including multiresonance, tunability, dielectrophoresis, live cell sensing, and machine&#8208;learning&#8208;aided analysis.

         <title>Carrier Transport Mechanism in Organic Antiambipolar Transistors Unveiled by Operando Photoemission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic antiambipolar transistors (AATs) have partially overlapped p&#8211;n junctions. At room temperature, this p&#8211;n junction induces a negative differential transconductance in an AAT. However, the detailed carrier transport mechanism remains unclear. Herein, we use operando photoemission electron microscopy to tackle this issue owing to the technique's ability to visualize conductive electrons in real time during the transistor operation. Notably, we observed that when the AAT is on, a depletion layer forms at the lateral p&#8211;n junction. The visualized depletion layer showed that both p&#8208; and n&#8208;type channels have pinch&#8208;off states in the gate voltage range when the AAT is in on state. The steep potential gradient at the lateral p&#8211;n interface enhances the electron conduction from n&#8208;type to p&#8208;type semiconductor. Another significant finding is that most electrons are considered to recombine with the accumulated holes in the p&#8208;type semiconductor, affording the reduction of photoemission intensity by approximately 80%. Our technique provides a thorough understanding of carrier transport in AATs, further improving the device performance.

         <title>Raman scattering measurement of suspended graphene under extreme strain induced by nanoindentation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Graphene is known as a super&#8208;stiff and extremely strong material. Hence, applying strains greater than 1% to graphene and simultaneously measuring changes in its physical properties has been challenging because of the limited methodologies for measuring both high strain and other physical properties. Here, we report the Raman scattering measurement of suspended graphene under extremely high biaxial strain as large as 6.1% using an atomic force microscopy (AFM)&#8211;Raman spectroscopy measurement tool. Nanoindentation was performed using AFM tips machined to have a flat top and a hole shape, resulting in a strained graphene area sufficiently large to enable the acquisition of a Raman signal. At the same time, the laser light was focused on the strained flat area of the graphene membrane. The Raman signal of the G and 2D bands of graphene was redshifted by 282 and 684 cm&#8722;1, respectively, which is unprecedented for graphene. Our measurement technique provides an effective methodology to measure variations in the physical properties of atomically thin materials under super&#8208;high strain.

         <title>Semi&#8208;immobilized Ionic Liquid Regulator with Fast Kinetics towards Highly Stable Zinc Anode under &#8208;35&#176;C to 60&#176;C</title>

Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries have been extensively investigated as next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries due to their advantages including high theoretical capacity, reliable safety, environment friendly, and low cost. However, the critical issues of irregular dendrite growth and intricate side reactions severely restrict the further industrialization of zinc ion batteries. Here, a strategy to fabricate a semi&#8208;immobilized ionic liquid interface layer is proposed to protect the Zn anode in a wide temperature range from &#8208;35&#176;C to 60&#176;C. The immobilized SiO2@cation can form high conjugate racks that can regulate the Zn2+ concentration gradient and self&#8208;polarizing electric field to guarantee uniform nucleation and planar deposition, the free anions of ILs can weaken hydrogen bonds of water to promote rapid Zn2+ desolvation and accelerate ion transport kinetics simultaneously. Because of these unique advantages, the cycling performance of the symmetric Zn batteries has been greatly enhanced, evidenced by a cycling life of 1800 h at 20&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, and a cycle lifespan of 2000 h under a wide temperature window from &#8208;35&#176;C&#8764;60&#176;C. The efficiency of this semi&#8208;immobilizing strategy has been well demonstrated in various full cells including pouch cells, showing high performance at large current (20 A g&#8211;1) and wide temperatures with extra&#8208;long cycles up to 80000 cycles. This work provides a new platform for constructing stable Zn anode and high&#8208;performance zinc ion batteries.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Integration of a Zinc Metasilicate Interface Layer Guiding Well&#8208;Regulated Zn Deposition</title>

A low&#8208;temperature wet&#8208;chemistry strategy with industrial operability is developed to realize large&#8208;scale integration of Zn&#8211;Si&#8211;O nanosheet arrays on Zn foil. Zn&#8208;island&#8208;based identical&#8208;location electron microscopy characterization is designed to visualize and uncover the in situ integration mechanism of Zn&#8211;Si&#8211;O layer. The life spans of symmetric cells, and full cells coupled with high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading cathode, have increased by 3&#8211;7 times.








Abstract
Uneven distribution of electric fields at the electrolyte&#8211;anode interface and associated Zn dendrite growth is one of the most critical barriers that limit the life span of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, new&#8208;type Zn&#8211;A&#8211;O (A = Si, Ti) interface layers with thin and uniform thickness, porosity, and hydrophilicity properties are developed to realize homogeneous and smooth Zn plating. For ZnSiO3 nanosheet arrays on Zn foil (Zn@ZSO), their formation follows an &#8220;etching&#8211;nucleation&#8211;growth&#8221; mechanism that is confirmed by a well&#8208;designed Zn&#8208;island&#8208;based identical&#8208;location microscopy method, the geometric area of which is up to 1000 cm2 in one&#8208;pot synthesis based on a low&#8208;temperature wet&#8208;chemical method. Guided by the structural advantages of the ZSO layer, the Zn2+ flux gets equalized. Besides ultralow polarization, the life spans of symmetric cells and full cells coupled with a high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading K0.27MnO2&#183;0.54H2O (8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) cathode, are increased by 3&#8211;7 times with the Zn@ZSO anode. Moreover, the large&#8208;scale preparation of Zn@ZSO foil contributes to a 0.5 Ah multilayer pouch cell with high performance, further confirming its prospects for practical application.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the characteristics of the microenvironment of vulnerable plaques, nanomedicine targeting strategies for assessing plaque vulnerability by imaging are systematically summarized, developments in construction of stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoplatforms and surface&#8208;functionalized nanoagents to boost the efficacy of plaque stabilization therapy are highlighted, and existing challenges and prospects in the fields of diagnosis and therapy of atherosclerosis based on nanomaterials are discussed.








Abstract
Atherosclerosis is considered one of the primary causes of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Unpredictable rupture of the vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques triggers adverse cardiovascular events such as acute myocardial syndrome and even sudden cardiac death. Therefore, assessing the vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaques and early intervention are of significance in reducing CVD mortality. Nanomedicine possesses tremendous advantages in achieving the integration of the diagnosis and therapy of atherosclerotic plaques because of its magnetic, optical, thermal, and catalytic properties. Based on the pathological characteristics of vulnerable plaques, stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoplatforms and surface&#8208;functionalized nanoagents are designed and have drawn great attention for accomplishing the precise imaging and treatment of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques due to their superior properties, such as high bioavailability, lesion&#8208;targeting specificity, on&#8208;demand cargo release, and low off&#8208;target damage. Here, the characteristics of vulnerable plaques are generalized, and some targeted strategies for boosting the accuracy of plaque vulnerability evaluation by imaging and the efficacy of plaque stabilization therapy (including antioxidant therapy, macrophage depletion therapy, regulation of lipid metabolism therapy, anti&#8208;inflammation therapy, etc.) are systematically summarized. In addition, existing challenges and prospects in this field are discussed, and it is believed to provide new thinking for the diagnosis and treatment of CVDs in the near future.

         <title>Gradient Design for High&#8208;Energy and High&#8208;Power Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge transport is a key process that dominates battery performance, and the microstructure of battery key components plays a central role in guiding the charge transport. By gradient design, optimal local charge&#8208;transport dynamics can be realized and high energy/power supported. Recent processes in the gradient design strategies of cathodes, lithium&#8208;metal anodes, and solid&#8208;state electrolytes are presented with future research directions highlighted.








Abstract
Charge transport is a key process that dominates battery performance, and the microstructures of the cathode, anode, and electrolyte play a central role in guiding ion and/or electron transport inside the battery. Rational design of key battery components with varying microstructure along the charge&#8208;transport direction to realize optimal local charge&#8208;transport dynamics can compensate for reaction polarization, which accelerates electrochemical reaction kinetics. Here, the principles of charge&#8208;transport mechanisms and their decisive role in battery performance are presented, followed by a discussion of the correlation between charge&#8208;transport regulation and battery microstructure design. The design strategies of the gradient cathodes, lithium&#8208;metal anodes, and solid&#8208;state electrolytes are summarized. Future directions and perspectives of gradient design are provided at the end to enable practically accessible high&#8208;energy and high&#8208;power&#8208;density batteries.

         <title>A New Polystyrene&#8211;Poly(vinylpyridinium) Ionic Copolymer Dopant for n&#8208;Type All&#8208;Polymer Thermoelectrics with High and Stable Conductivity Relative to the Seebeck Coefficient giving High Power Factor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel polystyrene&#8211;poly(vinylpyridinium)&#8208;based n&#8208;type polymer dopant is designed and synthesized. It can dope n&#8208;type conjugated polymers to make n&#8208;type all&#8208;polymer conducting materials and thermoelectrics, analogous to poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4&#8208;styrenesulfonate). An electron conductivity of 4.2 S cm&#8211;1, mobility of 0.86 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1 and power factor of 67 &#181;W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;2 are achieved.








Abstract
A novel n&#8208;type copolymer dopant polystyrene&#8211;poly(4&#8208;vinyl&#8208;N&#8208;hexylpyridinium fluoride) (PSpF) with fluoride anions is designed and synthesized by reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. This is thought to be the first polymeric fluoride dopant. Electrical conductivity of 4.2 S cm&#8211;1 and high power factor of 67 &#181;W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;2 are achieved for PSpF&#8208;doped polymer films, with a corresponding decrease in thermal conductivity as the PSpF concentration is increased, giving the highest ZT of 0.1. An especially high electrical conductivity of 58 S cm&#8211;1 at 88&#160;&#176;C and outstanding thermal stability are recorded. Further, organic transistors of PSpF&#8208;doped thin films exhibit high electron mobility and Hall mobility of 0.86 and 1.70 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1, respectively. The results suggest that polystyrene&#8211;poly(vinylpyridinium) salt copolymers with fluoride anions are promising for high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type all&#8208;polymer thermoelectrics. This work provides a new way to realize organic thermoelectrics with high conductivity relative to the Seebeck coefficient, high power factor, thermal stability, and broad processing window.

         <title>Polystyrene Pocket Lithography: Sculpting Plastic with Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct deep ultraviolet (DUV) photolithography method, which enables fabrication of microstructures in bulk polystyrene cell culture substrates, is presented. Pipelines for generating ink&#8208;based DUV masks and micropattern virtualization further increase the remarkable straightforwardness of the process. This, combined with the high applicability, can significantly improve accessibility of this class of microfabrication techniques to a broad biological research community.








Abstract
Tissue&#8208;culture&#8208;ware polystyrene is the gold standard for in vitro cell culture. While microengineering techniques can create advanced cell microenvironments in polystyrene, they require specialized equipment and reagents, which hinder their accessibility for most biological researchers. An economical and easily accessible method is developed and validated for fabricating microstructures directly in polystyrene with sizes approaching subcellular dimensions while requiring minimal processing time. The process involves deep ultraviolet irradiation through a shadow mask or ink pattern using inexpensive, handheld devices followed by selective chemical development with common reagents to generate micropatterns with depths/heights between 5 and 10&#160;&#181;m, which can be used to guide cell behavior. The remarkable straightforwardness of the process enables this class of microengineering techniques to be broadly accessible to diverse research communities.

         <title>Active Ultrahigh&#8208;Q (0.2 &#215; 106) THz Topological Cavities on a Chip</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;loss terahertz (THz) silicon topological interconnect&#8211;cavity system that can actively route signals through sharp bends by critically coupling to a topological cavity with an ultrahigh&#8208;quality (Q) factor of 0.2 &#215; 106 is shown. On&#8208;chip active tailoring is demonstrated of the cavity resonance linewidth, frequency, and modulation at extremely low power through complete suppression of the back reflection, essential for sixth generation (6G) communication with THz topological integrated photonic circuits.








Abstract
Rapid scaling of semiconductor devices has led to an increase in the number of processor cores and integrated functionalities onto a single chip to support the growing demands of high&#8208;speed and large&#8208;volume consumer electronics. To meet this burgeoning demand, an improved interconnect capacity in terms of bandwidth density and active tunability is required for enhanced throughput and energy efficiency. Low&#8208;loss terahertz silicon interconnects with larger bandwidth offer a solution for the existing inter&#8208;/intrachip bandwidth density and energy&#8208;efficiency bottleneck. Here, a low&#8208;loss terahertz topological interconnect&#8211;cavity system is presented that can actively route signals through sharp bends, by critically coupling to a topological cavity with an ultrahigh&#8208;quality (Q) factor of 0.2 &#215; 106. The topologically protected large Q factor cavity enables energy&#8208;efficient optical control showing 60&#160;dB modulation. Dynamic control is further demonstrated of the critical coupling between the topological interconnect&#8211;cavity for on&#8208;chip active tailoring of the cavity resonance linewidth, frequency, and modulation through complete suppression of the back reflection. The silicon topological cavity is complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS)&#8208;compatible and highly desirable for hybrid electronic&#8211;photonic technologies for sixth (6G) generation terahertz communication devices. Ultrahigh&#8208;Q cavity also paves the path for designing ultrasensitive topological sensors, terahertz topological integrated circuits, and nonlinear topological photonic devices.

Ultrahigh-&lt;i&gt;Q&lt;/i&gt; cavity also paves the path for designing ultrasensitive topological sensors, terahertz topological integrated circuits, and nonlinear topological photonic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Vinylene&#8208;Linker&#8208;Based Polymer Acceptor Featuring a Coplanar and Rigid Molecular Conformation Enables High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with Over 17% Efficiency</title>

         <dc:description>
A vinylene&#8208;linker&#8208;based polymer acceptor (PY&#8208;V&#8208;&#947;) with rigid and coplanar chain conformations is synthesized, exhibiting redshifted absorption and ordered packing. When employed in all&#8208;polymer solar cells, the PY&#8208;V&#8208;&#947;&#8208;based devices yield a higher efficiency of 17.1% than PY&#8208;T&#8208;&#947;&#8208; and PY&#8208;2T&#8208;&#947;&#8208;based ones and exhibit robust mechanical stability in flexible devices, suggesting the potential for commercial application.








Abstract
State&#8208;of&#8208;art Y&#8208;series polymer acceptors are typically based on a mono&#8208;thiophene linker, which can cause some twisted molecular conformations and thus limit the performance of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs). Here, a high&#8208;performance polymer acceptor based on vinylene linkers is reported, which leads to surprising changes in the polymers&#8217; molecular conformations, optoelectronic properties, and enhanced photovoltaic performance. It is found that the polymer acceptors based on thiophene or bithiophene linkers (PY&#8208;T&#8208;&#947; and PY&#8208;2T&#8208;&#947;) display significant molecular twisting between end&#8208;groups and linker units, while the vinylene&#8208;based polymer (PY&#8208;V&#8208;&#947;) exhibits a more coplanar and rigid molecular conformation. As a result, PY&#8208;V&#8208;&#947; demonstrates a better conjugation and tighter interchain stacking, which results in higher mobility and a reduced energetic disorder. Furthermore, detailed morphology investigations reveal that the PY&#8208;V&#8208;&#947;&#8208;based blend exhibits high domain purity and thus a better fill factor in its all&#8208;PSCs. With these, a higher efficiency of 17.1% is achieved in PY&#8208;V&#8208;&#947;&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs, which is the highest efficiency reported for binary all&#8208;PSCs to date. This work demonstrates that the vinylene&#8208;linker is a superior unit to build polymer acceptors with more coplanar and rigid chain conformation, which is beneficial for polymer aggregation and efficient all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Magnetic Anisotropy Control with Curie Temperature above 400 K in a van der Waals Ferromagnet for Spintronic Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic phase control is the source of fascinating correlated phenomena and the frontier research direction in materials science and spintronic devices. Magnetic anisotropy control and a dramatically enhanced Tc up to 400 K are realized in van der Waals ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 during a high&#8208;pressure loading&#8211;deloading process, shedding light on exploring the exchange interaction mechanism and realizing practical spintronic applications.








Abstract
The technological appeal of van der Waals ferromagnetic materials is the ability to control magnetism under external fields with desired thickness toward novel spintronic applications. For practically useful devices, ferromagnetism above room temperature or tunable magnetic anisotropy is highly demanded but remains challenging. To date, only a few layered materials exhibit unambiguous ferromagnetic ordering at room temperature via gating techniques or interface engineering. Here, it is demonstrated that the magnetic anisotropy control and dramatic modulation of Curie temperature (Tc) up to 400 K are realized in layered Fe5GeTe2 via the high&#8208;pressure diamond&#8208;anvil&#8208;cell technique. Magnetic phases manifesting with in&#8208;plane anisotropic, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane anisotropic and nearly isotropic magnetic states can be tuned in a controllable way, depicted by the phase diagram with a maximum Tc up to 360 K. Remarkably, the Tc can be gradually enhanced to above 400 K owing to the Fermi surface evolution during a pressure loading&#8211;deloading process. Such an observation sheds light on the understanding and control of emergent magnetic states in practical spintronic applications.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Mid&#8208;Infrared Biosensing in Aqueous Solutions with Graphene Plasmons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ identification of biomolecules in aqueous solutions by IR spectroscopy is important for exploring biological processes. However, the strong and broad IR absorption of water overwhelms the vibrations of the biomolecules. In this work, a tunable graphene plasmonic aqueous IR biosensor is exploited to directly probe a protein's vibrations and characterize the deuterium effects, which provides a platform for studying nanoscale biological processes.








Abstract
Identifying nanoscale biomolecules in aqueous solutions by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) provides an in situ and noninvasive method for exploring the structure, reactions, and transport of biologically active molecules. However, this remains a challenge due to the strong and broad IR absorption of water which overwhelms the respective vibrational fingerprints of the biomolecules. In this work, a tunable IR transparent microfluidic system with graphene plasmons is exploited to identify &#8776;2&#160;nm&#8208;thick proteins in physiological conditions. The acquired in situ tunability makes it possible to eliminate the IR absorption of water outside the graphene plasmonic hotspots by background subtraction. Most importantly, the ultrahigh confinement of graphene plasmons (confined to &#8776;15&#160;nm) permits the implementation of nanoscale sensitivity. Then, the deuterium effects on monolayer proteins are characterized within an aqueous solution. The tunable graphene&#8208;plasmon&#8208;enhanced FTIR technology provides a novel platform for studying biological processes in an aqueous solution at the nanoscale.

Abstract
Long processing time and high temperatures are often required in sintering ceramic electrolytes, which lead to volatile element loss and high cost. Here, we report an ultrafast sintering method of microwave&#8208;induced carbothermal shock to fabricate various ceramic electrolytes in seconds. Furthermore, it is also able to integrate electrode and electrolyte in one step by simultaneous co&#8208;sintering. Based on this ultrafast co&#8208;sintering technique, an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal battery with a high areal capacity is successfully achieved, realizing a promising electrochemical performance at room temperature. This method can extend to other various ceramic multilayer based solid devices.

         <title>Stable Zinc Anodes Enabled by a Zincophilic Polyanionic Hydrogel Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique polyanionic hydrogel is employed as an artificial protective layer for reversible Zn&#8208;metal anodes. The polyanions in the hydrogel framework facilitate a homogeneous zinc&#8208;ion flux, and the Zn&#8211;O bonding strengthens the interface and suppresses surface corrosion and irregular Zn dendrites growth. This strategy could apply also to other aqueous metal batteries.








Abstract
The practical application of the Zn&#8208;metal anode for aqueous batteries is greatly restricted by catastrophic dendrite growth, intricate hydrogen evolution, and parasitic surface passivation. Herein, a polyanionic hydrogel film is introduced as a protective layer on the Zn anode with the assistance of a silane coupling agent (denoted as Zn&#8211;SHn). The hydrogel framework with zincophilic &#8211;SO3&#8722; functional groups uniformizes the zinc ions flux and transport. Furthermore, such a hydrogel layer chemically bonded on the Zn surface possesses an anti&#8208;catalysis effect, which effectively suppresses both the hydrogen evolution reaction and formation of Zn dendrites. As a result, stable and reversible Zn stripping/plating at various currents and capacities is achieved. A full cell by pairing the Zn&#8211;SHn anode with a NaV3O8&#183;1.5 H2O cathode shows a capacity of around 176 mAh g&#8722;1 with a retention around 67% over 4000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1. This polyanionic hydrogel film protection strategy paves a new way for future Zn&#8208;anode design and safe aqueous batteries construction.

&lt;p&gt;A unique polyanionic hydrogel is employed as an artificial protective layer for reversible Zn-metal anodes. The polyanions in the hydrogel framework facilitate a homogeneous zinc-ion flux, and the Zn&#8211;O bonding strengthens the interface and suppresses surface corrosion and irregular Zn dendrites growth. This strategy could apply also to other aqueous metal batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practical application of the Zn-metal anode for aqueous batteries is greatly restricted by catastrophic dendrite growth, intricate hydrogen evolution, and parasitic surface passivation. Herein, a polyanionic hydrogel film is introduced as a protective layer on the Zn anode with the assistance of a silane coupling agent (denoted as Zn&#8211;SHn). The hydrogel framework with zincophilic &#8211;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; functional groups uniformizes the zinc ions flux and transport. Furthermore, such a hydrogel layer chemically bonded on the Zn surface possesses an anti-catalysis effect, which effectively suppresses both the hydrogen evolution reaction and formation of Zn dendrites. As a result, stable and reversible Zn stripping/plating at various currents and capacities is achieved. A full cell by pairing the Zn&#8211;SHn anode with a NaV&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;1.5 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O cathode shows a capacity of around 176 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a retention around 67% over 4000 cycles at 10 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This polyanionic hydrogel film protection strategy paves a new way for future Zn-anode design and safe aqueous batteries construction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting Electrochemical Styrene Transformation via Tandem Water Oxidation over a Single&#8208;Atom Cr1/CoSe2 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem oxidation strategy based on a Co&#8211;Cr cooperated single&#8208;atom Cr1/CoSe2 electrocatalyst is presented, turning the competition between the oxygen evolution reaction and styrene oxidation into mutual benefits via the migration of the *OOH intermediate from the Co to the Cr site, achieving an efficient and mild selective oxidation of styrene without any exogenous oxidizing reagent.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic oxidation of organics using water as the oxygen source is a prospective but challenging method to produce high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals; especially, the competitive oxygen evolution reaction (OER) limits its efficiency. Herein, a tandem catalysis strategy based on a single&#8208;atom catalyst with Cr atoms atomically dispersed at a CoSe2 support (Cr1/CoSe2) is presented. Thereinto, Co and Cr sites are endowed with a specific function to activate water and styrene respectively, and the competition between the OER and styrene oxidation is turned into mutual benefits via cooperated active sites. Under a potential of 1.6&#160;VAg/AgCl, excellent selectivity of 95% to benzaldehyde and a high conversion rate of styrene at 88% without any exogenous oxidizing reagent are achieved. Isotopic tracing, isotope&#8208;labeled in situ Raman spectra, and detailed theoretical calculation further reveal the tandem mechanism, showing that the transfer of *OOH intermediates from the Co to the Cr sites serves as a bridge to link the oxidation of water and styrene. This work develops a new strategy for the co&#8208;oxidation of multi&#8208;species based on tandem catalysis, providing novel insights for the design of single&#8208;atom catalysts.

         <title>Simultaneous Electrochemical Exfoliation and Covalent Functionalization of MoS2 Membrane for Ion Sieving</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through exfoliation of the electrochemically lithium&#8208;intercalated MoS2 in iodoacetamide water solution, the covalent functionalization of single&#8208;layer MoS2 with iodoacetamide molecules can be shortened to 15 min, and functionalized MoS2 membranes are fabricated via vacuum filtration. Under reverse osmosis mode, the functionalized MoS2 membranes exhibit rejection rates of &gt;90% and &gt;80% for various dyes and NaCl, respectively.








Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenide membranes exhibit good antiswelling properties but poor water desalination property. Here, a one&#8208;step covalent functionalization of MoS2 nanosheets for membrane fabrication is reported, which is accomplished by simultaneous exfoliating and grafting the lithium&#8208;ion&#8208;intercalated MoS2 in organic iodide water solution. The lithium intercalation amount in MoS2 is optimized so that the quality of the produced 2D nanosheets is improved with homogeneous size distribution. The lamellar MoS2 membranes are tested in reverse osmosis (RO), and the functionalized MoS2 membrane exhibits rejection rates of &gt;90% and &gt;80% for various dyes (Rhodamine B, Crystal Violet, Acid Fuchsin, Methyl Orange, and Evans Blue) and NaCl, respectively. The excellent ion&#8208;sieving performance and good water permeability of the functionalized MoS2 membranes are attributed to the suitable channel widths that are tuned by iodoacetamide. Furthermore, the stability of the functionalized MoS2 membranes in NaCl and dye solutions is also confirmed by RO tests. Molecular dynamics simulation shows that water molecules tend to form a single layer between the amide&#8208;functionalized MoS2 layers but a double layer between the ethanol&#8208;functionalized MoS2 (MoS2&#8208;ethanol) layers, which indicates that a less packed structure of water between the MoS2&#8208;ethanol layers leads to lower hydrodynamic resistance and higher permeation.

         <title>Engineered Exosomes with Independent Module/Cascading Function for Therapy of Parkinson's Disease by Multistep Targeting and Multistage Intervention Method</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of an &#8220;independent module/cascading function&#8221; to construct an engineered exosome nanotherapy platform is proposed. The artificial module with movement/chemotaxis ability is controllably combined with a natural exosome module with &#8220;one by one&#8221; mode by using a &#8220;differentiated&#8221; modification method, which realizes the &#8220;cascading function&#8221; for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.








Abstract
Current exosome engineering methods usually lead to the damage of exosome morphology and membrane, which cannot meet the complex needs of disease treatment. Herein, the concept of an &#8220;independent module/cascading function&#8221; is proposed to construct an engineered exosome nanotherapy platform including an independent artificial module and a natural module. The artificial module with movement/chemotaxis function is first synthesized, and then it is controllably combined with the natural exosome module with &#8220;one by one&#8221; mode through a &#8220;differentiated&#8221; modification method. The whole process can not only maintain the activity of the natural exosome module, but also endows it with motion ability, so as to realize the purpose of &#8220;cascading function&#8221; in the process of disease treatment. The above engineered exosomes are used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Moreover, the multistep targeting strategy of &#8220;disease microenvironment&#8208;damaged cells&#8208;diseased mitochondria&#8221; and the multistage intervention concept of &#8220;inhibiting deterioration and promoting repair&#8221; are proposed, so as to break through the bottleneck of the existing treatment of PD.

         <title>Recent progress of metal sulfide photocatalysts for solar energy conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Artificial photosynthetic solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical cycles enable an entire environment to operate in a more complex, yet effective, way to perform natural photosynthesis. However, such artificial systems suffer from a lack of well&#8208;established photocatalysts with the ability to harvest the solar spectrum and rich catalytic active&#8208;site density. Benefiting from extensive experimental and theoretical investigations, this bottleneck may be overcome by devising a photocatalytic platform based on metal sulfides with predominant electronic, physical, and chemical properties. These tunable properties can endow them with abundant active sites, favorable light utilization, and expedited charge transportation for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion. In this review, we describe how some vital lessons extracted from previous investigations are employed to promote the further development of metal sulfides for artificial photosynthesis, including water splitting, CO2 reduction, N2 reduction, and pollutant removal. Their functions, properties, synthetic strategies, emerging issues, design principles, and intrinsic functional mechanisms for photocatalytic redox reactions are discussed in detail. Finally, we highlight the associated challenges and prospects for the utilization of metal sulfides and envision future development trends in photocatalysis.

         <dc:description>
Janus oncolytic adenovirus&#8208;loaded 293T cell robots with full coating of targeted peptides and Janus modification of magnetic nanoparticles are capable of controllable magnetic propulsion and tumor&#8208;specific binding and killing. Such active medical platform with enhanced tissue retention and penetration shows the highest therapeutic efficacy in treating orthoptic mice bladder cancer models with minimized damage to normal tissues.








Abstract
A unique robotic medical platform is designed by utilizing cell robots as the active &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; of oncolytic adenovirus (OA), capable of tumor&#8208;selective binding and killing. The OA&#8208;loaded cell robots are fabricated by entirely modifying OA&#8208;infected 293T cells with cyclic arginine&#8211;glycine&#8211;aspartic acid tripeptide (cRGD) to specifically bind with bladder cancer cells, followed by asymmetric immobilization of Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) on the cell surface. OA can replicate in host cells and induce cytolysis to release the virus progeny to the surrounding tumor sites for sustainable infection and oncolysis. The asymmetric coating of magnetic NPs bestows the cell robots with effective movement in various media and wireless manipulation with directional migration in a microfluidic device and bladder mold under magnetic control, further enabling steerable movement and prolonged retention of cell robots in the mouse bladder. The biorecognition of cRGD and robust, controllable propulsion of cell robots work synergistically to greatly enhance their tissue penetration and anticancer efficacy in the 3D cancer spheroid and orthotopic mouse bladder tumor model. Overall, this study integrates cell&#8208;based microrobots with virotherapy to generate an attractive robotic system with tumor specificity, expanding the operation scope of cell robots in biomedical community.

         <title>The Role of Long&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;Group Spacers in Glycolated Copolymers for High&#8208;Performance Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New molecular design rules are established to overcome the trade&#8208;off between electronic and ionic conduction in OECTs. The gDPP&#8208;TTVTT copolymer achieves the best operational stability and maximum transconductance of 61.9 S cm&#8722;1. The long&#8208;alkyl&#8208;group spacer prevents morphological and electrostatic disruptions to the conjugated backbone, maintaining high electronic charge&#8208;carrier mobilities, while increasing ion density for efficient and stable OECTs.








Abstract
Semiconducting polymers with oligoethylene glycol (OEG) sidechains have attracted strong research interest for organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) applications. However, key molecular design rules for high&#8208;performance OECTs via efficient mixed electronic/ionic charge transport are still unclear. In this work, new glycolated copolymers (gDPP&#8208;TTT and gDPP&#8208;TTVTT) with diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) acceptor and thiophene (T) and vinylene (V) thiophene&#8208;based donor units are synthesized and characterized for accumulation mode OECTs, where a long&#8208;alkyl&#8208;group (C12) attached to the DPP unit acts as a spacer distancing the OEG groups from the polymer backbone. gDPP&#8208;TTVTT shows the highest OECT transconductance (61.9 S cm&#8211;1) and high operational stability, compared to gDPP&#8208;TTT and their alkylated counterparts. Surprisingly, gDPP&#8208;TTVTT also shows high electronic charge mobility in a field&#8208;effect transistor, suggesting efficient ion injection/diffusion without hindering its efficient electronic charge transport. The elongated donor unit (TTVTT) facilitates hole polaron formation to be more localized to the donor unit, leading to faster and easier polaron formation with less impact on polymer structure during OECT operation, as opposed to the TTT unit. This is supported by molecular dynamics simulation. These simultaneously high electronic and ionic charge&#8208;transport properties are achieved due to the long&#8208;alkyl&#8208;group spacer in amphipathic sidechains, providing an important molecular design rule for glycolated copolymers.

         <title>Revealing the Structural Coloration of Self&#8208;Assembled Chitin Nanocrystal Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The structural coloration of arthropods often arises from helicoidal structures made primarily of chitin. Although it is possible to achieve analogous helicoidal architectures by exploiting the self&#8208;assembly of chitin nanocrystals (ChNCs), to date no evidence of structural coloration has been reported from such structures. In this work, we identify that previous studies were constrained by both the experimental inability to access sub&#8208;micron helicoidal pitches and the intrinsically low birefringence of crystalline chitin. To expand the range of accessible pitches, here we isolate ChNCs from two phylogenetically distinct sources of &#945;&#8208;chitin, namely fungi and shrimp, while to increase the birefringence, we perform an in situ alkaline treatment, increasing the intensity of the reflected color by nearly two orders of magnitude. By combining this treatment with precise control over suspension formulation, we demonstrate structurally colored chitin&#8208;based films with reflection tunable from blue to near infrared.

         <title>Polarity&#8208;Differentiated Dielectric Materials in Monolayer Graphene Charge&#8208;Regulated Field&#8208;Effect Transistors for an Artificial Reflex Arc and Pain Modulation System of the Spinal Cord</title>

Abstract
The nervous system is a vital part of organisms to survive and it endows them with remarkable abilities, such as perception, recognition, regulation, learning, and decision&#8208;making, by intertwining myriad neurons. To realize such outstanding efficacies and functions, many artificial devices and systems have been investigated to emulate the operating principles of the nervous system. Here, an artificial reflex arc (ARA) and artificial pain modulation system (APMS) are proposed to imitate the unconscious behaviors of the spinal cord. GdxOy&#8208; and AlxOy&#8208;based charge&#8208;regulated field effect transistors (CRFETs) with a monolayer graphene channel were fabricated and adopted as inhibitory and excitatory synapses, respectively, under the same pulse signals to mimic the biological reflex arc through a connection with a poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene)&#8208;based actuator. Additionally, a memristor was integrated with a CRFET as the interneuron to regulate the Dirac point by controlling the voltage drop on the graphene channel, analogous to the descending pain inhibition system in the spinal cord, to prevent excessive pain perception. The proposed ARA and APMS have provided a significant step forward to realizing the functions of the nervous system, giving promising potential for developing future intelligent alarm systems, neuroprosthetics, and neurorobotics.

         <title>Inhibition and Reconstruction of Zener Tunneling in Photonic Honeycomb Lattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A precise site&#8208;dependent photonic material has the ability of modifying momentum&#8208;space properties and maintaining the coherence of bulk states in transport. Artificial honeycomb lattices with an effective force are constructed to realize highly controllable Zener tunneling and the coherence protection of particles transmitting on artificial quantum materials.








Abstract
Quantum coherence is the central element of particle states, and it characterizes the overall performance of various quantum materials. Bloch oscillation is a fundamental coherent behavior of particles under a static potential, which can be easily destroyed by Zener tunneling in multiband 2D lattice materials. The control of Zener tunneling therefore plays the key role in quantum engineering for complicated physical systems. Here, the inhibition and reconstruction of Zener tunneling in photonic honeycomb lattices are experimentally demonstrated. &#160;Deformed honeycomb lattices are integrated and an effective static potential is realized on the 2D lattice materials. Zener tunneling disappears in stretch&#8208;type lattices and wave packets stay in the dispersionless upper energy band. On the contrary, Zener tunneling is greatly enhanced in compression&#8208;type lattices and wave packets exhibit directional oscillations without branches, which manifest the preserved coherence of the wave packets. The results demonstrate the protection of photonic coherence by structurally controlling the Zener tunneling, representing a step toward flexible quantum engineering for large&#8208;scale artificial quantum&#160;materials.

Abstract
Riding on the rapid growth in electric vehicles and the stationary energy storage market, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries and next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries (i.e., advanced batteries) have been long&#8208;accepted as essential building blocks for future technology reaching the specific energy density of 400&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at the cell&#8208;level. Such progress, mainly driven by the emerging electrode materials or electrolytes, necessitates the development of polymeric materials with advanced functionalities in the battery to address new challenges. Therefore, it is urgently required to understand the basic chemistry and essential research directions in polymeric materials and establish a library for the polymeric materials that enables the development of advanced batteries. Herein, based on indispensable polymeric materials in advanced high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion, lithium&#8208;sulfur, lithium metal, and dual&#8208;ion battery chemistry, the key research directions of polymeric materials for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and safety are summarized and design strategies for further improving performance are examined. Furthermore, the challenges of polymeric materials for advanced battery technologies are discussed.

Abstract
Phase change materials (PCMs) offer tremendous potential to store thermal energy during reversible phase transitions for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications. The practicality of these materials is adversely restricted by volume expansion, phase segregation, and leakage problems associated with conventional solid&#8208;liquid PCMs. Solid&#8208;solid PCMs, as promising alternatives to solid&#8208;liquid PCMs, are gaining much attention towards practical thermal energy storage (TES) owing to their inimitable advantages such as solid&#8208;state processing, negligible volume change during phase transition, no contamination, and long cyclic life. Herein, we aim to provide a holistic analysis of solid&#8208;solid PCMs suitable for thermal energy harvesting, storage, and utilization. We start by presenting developing strategies of solid&#8208;solid PCMs and then discuss the structure&#8208;property relationship followed by potential applications. We finish by presenting an outlook discussion with momentous challenges and future directions. We hope our efforts will provide a guideline to the scientific community to develop high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;solid PCMs for advanced TES applications

         <title>Reinforced Layered Double Hydroxide Oxygen&#8208;Evolution Electrocatalysts: A Polyoxometallic Acid Wet&#8208;Etching Approach and Synergistic Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiskilled polyoxometallic acid etching approach to ingeniously reconstructing nickel&#8211;iron&#8208;based layered double hydroxides through morphology optimization, active site synergistic regulation, and defect regulation as a promising electrode post&#8208;treatment technique toward industrial anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane electrolyzer applications is reported.








Abstract
Nickel&#8211;iron&#8208;based layered double hydroxides (NiFe LDHs) have attracted tremendous research and industrial interests for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysis. However, methodologies on simultaneous regulation of performance&#8208;influencing factors remain scarce and their real synergistic effects are not clear enough. Herein, a versatile polyoxometallic acids (POMs) etching approach is reported to ingeniously reconstruct NiFe LDH, including 3D morphological nanotailoring, Fe3+ and &#945;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 active species reconfiguration, creation of multiple Ni, Fe, and O vacancies, and intercalation of POM polyanionic clusters. The experimental and theoretical data collaboratively unveil that control of the key performance&#8208;influencing factors and their multiple synergistic mechanisms dominantly contribute to the step&#8208;like OER performance enhancement. The reinforced electrocatalyst is further produced with low cost and high performance up to &#1060;180 mm in diameter, showing its feasibility and advancement of the promising configuration of NiFe LDH&#8208;PMo12(+) II Ni@NiFe LDH(&#8722;) for alkaline anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane electrode stack cells. Furthermore, to mathematically evaluate the evolution, a novel empirical formula is proposed for quantitative identification of structure&#8211;activity correlations, which offers an opportunity for first and fast reliability on materials screening.

         <title>Short&#8208;Range Diffusion Enables General Synthesis of Medium&#8208;Entropy Alloy Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Medium&#8208;entropy alloy aerogels (MEAAs) with the advantages of both multimetallic alloys and aerogels are promising new materials in catalytic and mechanical applications. However, limited by the immiscible behavior of different metals, it is still a grand challenge to achieve single&#8208;phase MEAAs using current synthetic methods. Herein, we report a general strategy for the preparation of ultralight three&#8208;dimensional (3D) porous MEAAs with the lowest density of 39.3&#160;mg cm&#8722;3 among the metal materials and a very high porosity of 99.5% through combining the auto&#8208;combustion method and subsequent low&#8208;temperature reduction procedures. The homogenous mixing of precursors at ionic level makes the short&#8208;range diffusion of metal atoms possible to drive the formation of single&#8208;phase MEAAs. As a proof of concept in catalysis, as&#8208;synthesized Ni50Co15Fe30Cu5 MEAAs exhibit a high mass activity of 1.62 A mg&#8722;1 and specific activity of 132.24&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 towards methanol oxidation reactions, much higher than those of the low&#8208;entropy counterparts. In&#8208;situ Fourier transform infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies reveal that the highly selective CO2&#8208;emission&#8208;free conversion of methanol to formate over MEAA catalysts. We also demonstrate that the methanol&#8208;oxidation&#8208;assisted MEAAs&#8208;based water electrolyzer can achieve a low cell voltage of 1.476&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 173&#160;mV lower than that of traditional alkaline water electrolyzer, and obtain value&#8208;added formate at anode to realize the sustainable H2 generation at cathode. This work lays the foundation for the design of advanced 3D MEAAs and broadens the electrocatalytic application of multimetallic MEAAs.

         <title>Phonon Symphony of Stacked of Multilayer and Weakly Bond Lowering Lattice Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Controlling of lattice vibrations to obtain intrinsic low thermal conductivity play a critical role in thermal management of electronic and photonic devices, energy converters and thermal insulation, which necessitates exploring new compounds and a thorough understanding of their chemical structure, bonding and lattice dynamics. Herein, we demonstrated a new chalcogenide, Ga6Cr5Se16, shows intrinsic low lattice thermal conductivity, which crystallizes in the monoclinic phase (C2/m) with the stacked inversed GaSe4 layers (g&#8217;), closed&#8208;packed Cr3+Se6 layers (c), GaSe4 layers (g) and loosely&#8208;stacked Cr2+Se6 layers (c&#8217;) along the c axis. In this structure, a wide variety of chemical bonding arrange in each layer, such as covalent Ga&#8211;Se, covalent Cr3+&#8211;Se, and weaker Cr2+&#8211;Se bonding, which endue it a large phonon symphony by strong coupling of soft acoustic and low&#8208;lying optical phonons. As a result, Ga6Cr5Se16 realizes an intrinsic low lattice thermal conductivity of 0.79 W/m/K at 323 K, which is almost four times, or twice lower than that of Cr3Se4 (2.95 W/m/K), or Cr2Se3 (1.56 W/m/K), Ga2Se3 (1.36 W/m/K) at 323 K, respectively. These insights will offer comprehensive understanding of the phonon propagation in complex layered chalcogenides, also shed useful light on future design of low lattice thermal conductivity solids.

         <title>Programming Cellular Alignment in Engineered Cardiac Tissue via Bioprinting Anisotropic Organ Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aligned cardiac tissues are produced by 3D bioprinting a densely cellular ink composed of anisotropic organ building blocks (aOBBs). The aOBBs undergo shear&#8208;induced alignment along the print path when extruded through a tapered nozzle. This method enables programmable control over cardiac tissue alignment across multiple scales.








Abstract
The ability to replicate the 3D myocardial architecture found in human hearts is a grand challenge. Here, the fabrication of aligned cardiac tissues via bioprinting anisotropic organ building blocks (aOBBs) composed of human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC&#8208;CMs) is reported. A bioink composed of contractile cardiac aOBBs is first generated and aligned cardiac tissue sheets with linear, spiral, and chevron features are printed. Next, aligned cardiac macrofilaments are printed, whose contractile force and conduction velocity increase over time and exceed the performance of spheroid&#8208;based cardiac tissues. Finally, the ability to spatially control the magnitude and direction of contractile force by printing cardiac sheets with different aOBB alignment is highlighted. This research opens new avenues to generating functional cardiac tissue with high cell density and complex cellular alignment.

         <title>Real&#8208;Space Crystal Structure Analysis by Low&#8208;Dose Focal&#8208;Series TEM Imaging of Organic Materials with Near&#8208;Atomic Resolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) methodology, low&#8208;dose focal&#8208;series reconstruction (LD&#8208;FSR), enables near&#8208;atomic resolution of 1.6 &#197;. This method allows the distinction between co&#8208;existing organic polymorphs, and observation of crystal defects and atoms. Moreover, a new copper phthalocyanine polymorph (&#955;&#8208;CuPc) is identified using LD&#8208;FSR, resulting in real&#8208;space crystal structure elucidation.








Abstract
Structural analysis of beam&#8208;sensitive materials by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) represents a significant challenge, as high&#8208;resolution TEM (HRTEM) requires high electron doses that limit its applicability to stable inorganic materials. Beam&#8208;sensitive materials, e.g., organic crystals, must be imaged under low dose conditions, leading to problematic contrast interpretation and loss of fine structural details. Here, HRTEM imaging of organic crystalline materials with near&#8208;atomic resolution of up to 1.6 &#197; is described, which enables real&#8208;space studies of crystal structures, as well as observation of co&#8208;existing polymorphs, crystal defects, and atoms. This is made possible by a low&#8208;dose focal&#8208;series reconstruction methodology, which provides HRTEM images where contrast reflects true object structure and can be performed on contemporary cryo&#8208;EM instruments available to many research institutions. Copper phthalocyanine (CuPc), a perchlorinated analogue of CuPc, and indigo crystalline films are imaged. In the case of indigo crystals, co&#8208;existing polymorphs and individual atoms (carbonyl oxygen) can be observed. In the case of CuPc, several polymorphs are observed, including a new one, for which the crystal structure is found based on direct in&#8208;focus imaging, accomplishing real&#8208;space crystal structure elucidation. Such direct analysis can be transformative for structure studies of organic materials.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;pressure&#8208;guided superhydrophobic surfaces with adaptive adhesion and stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The dynamic application environments of superhydrophobic surfaces, such as in the manufacturing, chemical, and garment industries, require the fast adaptiveness of the surfaces to their surroundings. Despite the progress in materials and structural design of superhydrophobic surfaces, simultaneously achieving high superhydrophobic stability and low adhesion by traditional design is still challenging. Here, we demonstrate a liquid&#8208;pressure&#8208;guided superhydrophobic surface with self&#8208;adjustable solid&#8208;liquid stability and adhesion when reacting to the dynamic environmental requirements. To understand the underlying adaptive processes, we imaged the liquid impalement dynamics in three dimensions by confocal microscope and measured the stability and superhydrophobicity in varied systems. We envision our design strategy of liquid&#8208;pressure&#8208;guided superhydrophobic surfaces with dynamic anti&#8208;infiltration capability could stimulate the development of stable superhydrophobicity under complex wetting conditions.

         <title>Tensile&#8208;Strained Palladium Nanosheets for Synthetic Catalytic Therapy and Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Palladium nanosheets (Pd NSs) are well&#8208;investigated photothermal therapy (PTT) agents, but their catalytic potential for tumor therapy has been underexplored owing to the inactive dominant (111) facets. Herein, lattice tensile strain is introduced by surface reconstruction to activate the inert surface, endowing the strained Pd NSs (SPd NSs) with photodynamic, catalase&#8208;like and peroxidase&#8208;like properties. Tensile strain promoting the photodynamic and enzyme&#8208;like activities is revealed by density functional theory calculations. Compared with Pd NSs, SPd NSs exhibit lower photothermal effect, but &#8764;5 times higher tumor inhibition rate. This work calls for further study to activate nanomaterials by strain engineering and surface reconstruction for catalytic therapy of tumors.

         <title>Interface Modulated Resistive Switching in Mo&#8208;irradiated ReS2 for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Coupling charge impurity scattering effects and charge carrier modulation by doping can offer intriguing opportunities for atomic&#8208;level control of resistive switching (RS). Nonetheless, such effects have remained unexplored for memristive applications based on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials. Here we report a facile approach to transform a RS&#8208;inactive rhenium disulfide (ReS2) into an effective switching material through interfacial modulation induced by Mo&#8208;irradiation doping. Using ReS2 as a model system, we unveil a unique RS mechanism based on the formation/dissolution of metallic &#946;&#8208;ReO2 filament across the defective ReS2 interface during the set/reset process. Through simple interfacial modulation, ReS2 of various thicknesses are switchable by modulating Mo irradiation period. Besides, the Mo&#8208;irradiated ReS2 memristor further exhibits a bipolar non&#8208;volatile switching ratio of nearly two orders of magnitude, programmable multilevel resistance states, and long&#8208;term synaptic plasticity. Additionally, the fabricated device could achieve a high MNIST learning accuracy of 91% under a non&#8208;identical pulse train. Our findings manifest the potential for modulating resistive switching in RS&#8208;inactive 2D materials via the unique doping&#8208;induced charged impurity scattering property.

         <title>Morphology Tuned Pt3Ge Accelerates Water Dissociation to Industrial Standard Hydrogen Production over a wide pH Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The discovery of novel materials for industrial standard hydrogen production is the present need considering the global energy infrastructure. We introduce a novel electrocatalyst, Pt3Ge, engineered with a desired crystallographic facet (202) accelerates hydrogen production by water electrolysis and records industrially desired operational stability compared to the commercial catalyst platinum. Pt3Ge&#8208;(202) exhibits low overpotential of 21.7 mV (24.6 mV for Pt/C) and 92 mV for 10 mA/cm2 and 200 mA/cm2 current density, respectively in 0.5M H2SO4. It also exhibits remarkable stability of 15,000 accelerated degradation tests cycles (5000 for Pt/C) and exceptional durability of 500 h (@10 mA/cm2) in acidic media. Pt3Ge&#8208;(202) also displayed low overpotential of 96 mV for 10 mA/cm2 current density in the alkaline medium, rationalizing its hydrogen production ability over a wide pH range required commercial operations. Long&#8208;term durability (&gt;75 h in alkaline media) with the industrial level current density (&gt;500 mA/cm2) has been demonstrated by utilizing the electrochemical flow reactor. The driving force behind this stupendous performance of Pt3Ge&#8208;(202) has been envisaged by mapping the reaction mechanism, active sites and charge transfer kinetics via controlled electrochemical experiments, ex&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in&#8208;situ infrared spectroscopy and in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy further corroborated by first principles calculations.

Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ge-(202) exhibits low overpotential of 21.7 mV (24.6 mV for Pt/C) and 92 mV for 10 mA/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 200 mA/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; current density, respectively in 0.5M H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. It also exhibits remarkable stability of 15,000 accelerated degradation tests cycles (5000 for Pt/C) and exceptional durability of 500 h (@10 mA/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in acidic media. Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ge-(202) also displayed low overpotential of 96 mV for 10 mA/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; current density in the alkaline medium, rationalizing its hydrogen production ability over a wide pH range required commercial operations. Long-term durability (&amp;gt;75 h in alkaline media) with the industrial level current density (&amp;gt;500 mA/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) has been demonstrated by utilizing the electrochemical flow reactor. The driving force behind this stupendous performance of Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ge-(202) has been envisaged by mapping the reaction mechanism, active sites and charge transfer kinetics via controlled electrochemical experiments, ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in-situ infrared spectroscopy and in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy further corroborated by first principles calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Universal Dynamic Liquid Interface for Healing Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal method of creating a dynamic healing interface (DHI) is launched by reinforcing the defective surface and grain boundaries of perovskite film with nonvolatile 2&#8208;bromonaphthalene (BN) with a low melting point of 53&#8211;58&#160;&#176;C. Different from static interfaces, the fluid characteristic originating from the easy solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid phase conversion of the DHI not only reinforces management of defect passivation and energetics modification, but also enables effective defect real&#8208;time self&#8208;healing. High efficiencies are thus achieved for popular PSCs up to 12.05% (CsPbIBr2), 14.14% (CsPbI2Br), and 23.37% (FA0.92MA0.08PbI3).








Abstract
Healing charge&#8208;selective contact interfaces in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) highly determines the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability. However, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies are often static by one&#8208;off formation of a functional interlayer, which delivers fixed interfacial properties during the subsequent operation. As a result, defects formed in&#8208;service will gradually deteriorate the photovoltaic performances. Herein, a dynamic healing interface (DHI) is presented by incorporating a low&#8208;melting&#8208;point small molecule onto perovskite film surface for highly efficient and stable PSCs. Arising from the reduced non&#8208;radiative recombination, the DHI boosts the PCE to 12.05% for an all&#8208;inorganic CsPbIBr2 solar cell and 14.14% for a CsPbI2Br cell, as well as 23.37% for an FA0.92MA0.08PbI3 (FA = formamidinium, MA = methylammonium) cell. The solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid phase conversion of DHI at elevated temperature causes a longitudinal infiltration into the bulk perovskite film to maximize the charge extraction, passivate defects at grain boundaries, and suppress ion migration. Furthermore, the stability is remarkably enhanced under air, heat, and persistent light&#8208;irradiation conditions, paving a universal strategy for advanced perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronics.

However, the state-of-the-art strategies are often static by one-off formation of a functional interlayer, which delivers fixed interfacial properties during the subsequent operation. As a result, defects formed in-service will gradually deteriorate the photovoltaic performances.

         <title>Studying Complex Evolution of Hyperelastic Materials under External Field Stimuli using Artificial Neural Networks with Spatiotemporal Features in a Small&#8208;Scale Dataset</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonlinear mechanical properties of hyperelastic materials can be viewed as responses of materials to external serial stimuli. A convolutional bidirectional long short&#8208;term memory (CBLSTM) model with spatiotemporal features is used to capture the complex evolution of structures and properties of materials under external field stimuli and to design materials with excellent performance via taking full advantage of data information even in a small&#8208;scale dataset.








Abstract
Deep&#8208;learning (DL) methods, in consideration of their excellence in dealing with highly complex structure&#8211;performance relationships for materials, are expected to become a new design paradigm for breakthroughs in material performance. However, in most cases, it is impractical to collect massive&#8208;scale experimental data or open&#8208;source theoretical databases to support training DL models with sufficient prediction accuracy. In a dataset consisting of 483 porous silicone rubber observations generated via ink&#8208;writing additive manufacturing, this work demonstrates that constructing low&#8208;dimensional, accurate descriptors is the prerequisite for obtaining high&#8208;precision DL models based on small experimental datasets. On this basis, a unique convolutional bidirectional long short&#8208;term memory model with spatiotemporal features extraction capability is designed, whose hierarchical learning mechanism further reduces the requirement for the amount of data by taking full advantage of data information. The proposed approach can be expected as a powerful tool for innovative material design on small experimental datasets, which can also be used to explore the evolutionary mechanisms of the structures and properties of materials under complex working conditions.

         <title>The Non&#8208;Classical Crystallization Mechanism of a Composite Biogenic Guanine Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Spectacular colors and visual phenomena in animals are produced by light interference from highly reflective guanine crystals. Little is known about how organisms regulate crystal morphology to tune the optics of these systems. By following guanine crystal formation in developing spiders, we elucidate a crystallization mechanism. Guanine crystallization is a &#8220;non&#8208;classical&#8221;, multi&#8208;step process involving a progressive ordering of states. Crystallization begins with nucleation of partially ordered nanogranules from a disordered precursor phase. Growth proceeds by orientated attachment of the nanogranules into platelets which coalesce into single crystals, via progressive relaxation of structural defects. Despite their prismatic morphology, the platelet texture is retained in the final crystals, which are composites of crystal lamellae and interlamellar sheets. Interactions between the macromolecular sheets and the planar face of guanine appear to direct nucleation, favoring platelet formation. These findings provide insights on how organisms control the morphology and optical properties of molecular crystals.

         <title>Fabrication of Bragg Mirrors by Multilayer Inkjet Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Bragg mirrors are widely applied in optical and photonic devices due to their capability of light management. However, the fabrication of Bragg mirrors is mainly accomplished by physical and chemical vapor deposition processes, which are costly and do not allow for lateral patterning. We here report for the first time the fabrication of Bragg mirrors by fully inkjet printing. The photonic bandgap of Bragg mirrors is tailored by adjusting the number of bilayers in the stack and the layer thickness via simply varying printing parameters. An ultra&#8208;high reflectance of 99% is achieved with the devices consisting of ten bilayers only, and the central wavelength of Bragg mirrors is tuned from visible into near&#8208;infrared wavelength range. Inkjet printing allows for fabricating Bragg mirrors on various substrates (e.g., glass and foils), in different sizes and variable lateral patterns. The printed Bragg mirrors not only exhibit a high reflection at designed wavelengths but also show an outstanding homogeneity in color over a large area. Our approach thus enables additive manufacturing for various applications ranging from microscale photonic elements to enhanced functionality and aesthetics in large&#8208;area displays and solar technologies.

         <title>Unraveling Thermodynamic and Kinetic Contributions to the Stability of Doped Nanocrystalline Alloys using Nanometallic Multilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided by modeling informed selection of the Mo&#8211;Au system, evolving grain boundary segregation behavior is explored through in situ electron microscopy thermal aging experiments on nanometallic multilayers. Isolation of the underlying stability mechanisms is accomplished by mapping the Au distribution with temperature, which, through comparison with thermodynamic predictions, collectively demonstrates the segregation states responsible for temperature&#8208;dependent stability transitions.








Abstract
Targeted doping of grain boundaries is widely pursued as a pathway for combating thermal instabilities in nanocrystalline metals. However, certain dopants predicted to produce grain&#8208;boundary&#8208;segregated nanocrystalline configurations instead form small nanoprecipitates at elevated temperatures that act to kinetically inhibit grain growth. Here, thermodynamic modeling is implemented to select the Mo&#8211;Au system for exploring the interplay between thermodynamic and kinetic contributions to nanostructure stability. Using nanoscale multilayers and in situ transmission electron microscopy thermal aging, evolving segregation states and the corresponding phase transitions are mapped with temperature. The microstructure is shown to evolve through a transformation at lower homologous temperatures (&lt;600&#160;&#176;C) where solute atoms cluster and segregate to the grain boundaries, consistent with predictions from thermodynamic models. An increase in temperature to 800&#160;&#176;C is accompanied by coarsening of the grain structure via grain boundary migration but with multiple pinning events uncovered between migrating segments of the grain boundary and local solute clustering. Direct comparison between the thermodynamic predictions and experimental observations of microstructure evolution thus demonstrates a transition from thermodynamically preferred to kinetically inhibited nanocrystalline stability and provides a general framework for decoupling contributions to complex stability transitions while simultaneously targeting a dominant thermal stability regime.

Isolation of the underlying stability mechanisms is accomplished by mapping the Au distribution with temperature, which, through comparison with thermodynamic predictions, collectively demonstrates the segregation states responsible for temperature-dependent stability transitions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeted doping of grain boundaries is widely pursued as a pathway for combating thermal instabilities in nanocrystalline metals. However, certain dopants predicted to produce grain-boundary-segregated nanocrystalline configurations instead form small nanoprecipitates at elevated temperatures that act to kinetically inhibit grain growth. Here, thermodynamic modeling is implemented to select the Mo&#8211;Au system for exploring the interplay between thermodynamic and kinetic contributions to nanostructure stability. Using nanoscale multilayers and in situ transmission electron microscopy thermal aging, evolving segregation states and the corresponding phase transitions are mapped with temperature. The microstructure is shown to evolve through a transformation at lower homologous temperatures (&amp;lt;600&#160;&#176;C) where solute atoms cluster and segregate to the grain boundaries, consistent with predictions from thermodynamic models. An increase in temperature to 800&#160;&#176;C is accompanied by coarsening of the grain structure via grain boundary migration but with multiple pinning events uncovered between migrating segments of the grain boundary and local solute clustering. Direct comparison between the thermodynamic predictions and experimental observations of microstructure evolution thus demonstrates a transition from thermodynamically preferred to kinetically inhibited nanocrystalline stability and provides a general framework for decoupling contributions to complex stability transitions while simultaneously targeting a dominant thermal stability regime.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Effective Passivation with Self&#8208;Organized Molecules for Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small molecules with a planar molecular skeleton exhibit effective defect&#8208;passivation capability for perovskite photovoltaics, contributed by their ordered intermolecular arrangement and well&#8208;matched size with the perovskite lattice. The passivators spontaneously form a uniform passivation network adherent to the bottom surface of perovskite films during a top&#8208;down crystallization via liquid medium annealing, which enables the best device yield in&#8208;lab efficiency of 25.05%.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 25% over the past decade and effective passivation for the interface with high trap density plays a significant role in this process. Here, two organic molecules are studied as passivators, and it is demonstrated that an advantageous molecular geometry and intermolecular ordering, aside from the functional moieties, are of great significance for effective and extensive passivation. Besides, the passivation molecules spontaneously form a uniform passivation network adjacent to the bottom surface of perovskite films during a top&#8208;down crystallization via liquid medium annealing, which greatly reduces defect&#8208;assisted recombination throughout the whole perovskite/SnO2 interface. The champion device yields an in&#8208;lab PCE of 25.05% (certified 24.39%). The investigation provides a more comprehensive understanding of passivation and a new avenue to achieve effective bottom&#8208;interface engineering for perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Preparation of Amorphous SnO2&#8208;Encapsulated Multiphased Crystalline Cu Heterostructures for Highly Efficient CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three types of Cu@SnO2 nanostructures with hemicapsule, yolk&#8211;shell, and core&#8211;shell architectures are synthesized, in which a series of unconventional phases of Cu (i.e., 2H, 4H, and 6H) is observed. The obtained hemicapsule heterostructures exhibit superior CO2 reduction reaction selectivity toward CO and formate with high Faradaic efficiency (above 90%) in a wide potential window, outperforming their yolk&#8211;shell and core&#8211;shell counterparts.








Abstract
Controlling the architectures and crystal phases of metal@semiconductor heterostructures is very important for modulating their physicochemical properties and enhancing their application performances. Here, a facile one&#8208;pot wet&#8208;chemical method to synthesize three types of amorphous SnO2&#8208;encapsulated crystalline Cu heterostructures, i.e., hemicapsule, yolk&#8211;shell, and core&#8211;shell nanostructures, in which unconventional crystal phases (e.g., 2H, 4H, and 6H) and defects (e.g., stacking faults and twin boundaries) are observed in the crystalline Cu cores, is reported. The hemicapsule Cu@SnO2 heterostructures, with voids that not only expose the Cu core with unconventional phases but also retain the interface between Cu and SnO2, show an excellent electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) selectivity toward the production of CO and formate with high Faradaic efficiency (FE) above 90% in a wide potential window from &#8722;1.05 to &#8722;1.55&#160;V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), and the highest FE of CO2RR (95.3%) is obtained at &#8722;1.45&#160;V (vs RHE). This work opens up a new way for the synthesis of new heterostructured nanomaterials with promising catalytic application.

Abstract
Memory technologies and applications implemented fully or partially using emerging two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials have attracted increasing interest in the research community in recent years. Their unique characteristics provide new possibilities for highly integrated circuits with superior performances, low power consumption as well as special functionalities. Here, an overview of progress in 2D material&#8208;based memory technologies and applications on the circuit level is presented. In the material growth and fabrication aspects, the advantages and disadvantages of various methods for producing large&#8208;scale 2D memory devices in batches are discussed. Reports on 2D material&#8208;based integrated memory circuits, from conventional dynamic random&#8208;access memory (DRAM), static random&#8208;access memory (SRAM), and Flash memory arrays, to emerging memristive crossbar structures, all the way to three&#8208;dimensional (3D) monolithic stacking architecture, are systematically reviewed. Comparisons between experimental implementations and theoretical estimations for different integration architectures are given in terms of the critical parameters in 2D memory devices. Attempts to use 2D memory arrays for in&#8208;memory computing applications, which are mostly focused on logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory and neuromorphic computing, are summarized here. Finally, we review the major challenges that impede the large&#8208;scale applications of 2D material&#8208;based memory, and also give perspectives on possible approaches towards a more reliable system&#8208;level fabrication, hopefully shedding some light on future research in this field.

         <title>Multichannel superposition of grafted perfect vortex beams</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Inspired by plant grafting; grafted vortex beams can be formed through grafting two or more helical phase profiles of optical vortex beams. Recently; grafted perfect vortex beams (GPVBs) have attracted much attention due to their unique optical properties and potential applications. However; the current method to generate and manipulate GPVBs requires a complex and bulky optical system; hindering further investigation and limiting its practical applications. Here; we propose and demonstrate a compact metasurface approach for generating and manipulating GPVBs in multiple channels which eliminates the need for such a complex optical setup. For the first time; a single metasurface is utilized to realize various superpositions of GPVBs with different combinations of topological charges in four channels; leading to asymmetric singularity distributions. The positions of singularities in the superimposed beam can be further modulated by introducing an initial phase difference in the metasurface design. Our work demonstrates a compact metasurface platform that performs a sophisticated optical task that is very challenging with conventional optics; opening opportunities for the investigation and applications of GPVBs in a wide range of emerging application areas such as singular optics and quantum science.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II photothermally triggered &#8220;oxygen bomb&#8221; for hypoxic tumor programmed cascade therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hypoxia as a characteristic feature of solid tumors, has a close relationship with tumor resistance to photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemotherapy. Perfluorocarbon (PFC) was reported to relieve hypoxic in solid tumors by acting as an oxygen carrier via several nanostructures. However, the oxygen delivery process is mostly driven by a concentration gradient, which is uncontrollable. Herein, a photothermally controlled &#8220;oxygen bomb&#8221; PSPP&#8208;Au980&#8208;D is designed by encapsulating a PFC core within a functionalized bilayer polymer shell. Near&#8208;infrared second window photothermal agent gold nanorods (AuNRs) with excellent photo&#8208;to&#8208;heat energy conversion ability are fabricated on the surface of a polymer shell via an innovative modified two&#8208;step seedless ex situ growth process to thermally trigger O2 release. Then, a programmed cascade therapy strategy is customized for hypoxic orthotopic pancreatic cancer. Firstly, PSPP&#8208;Au980&#8208;D is irradiated by a 980&#160;nm laser to photothermally trigger O2 infusing into the hypoxic tumor microenvironment, which is accompanied by local hyperemia and doxorubicin release. Subsequently, a 680&#160;nm laser is executed to generate singlet oxygen in the oxygenated tumor microenvironment for PDT. This choreographed programmed cascade therapy strategy would provide a new route for suppressing hypoxic tumor growth under mild conditions based on controllable and effective oxygen release.

Firstly, PSPP-Au&lt;sub&gt;980&lt;/sub&gt;-D is irradiated by a 980&#160;nm laser to photothermally trigger O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; infusing into the hypoxic tumor microenvironment, which is accompanied by local hyperemia and doxorubicin release. Subsequently, a 680&#160;nm laser is executed to generate singlet oxygen in the oxygenated tumor microenvironment for PDT. This choreographed programmed cascade therapy strategy would provide a new route for suppressing hypoxic tumor growth under mild conditions based on controllable and effective oxygen release.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Construction of N, P co&#8208;doped carbon frames anchored with Fe single atoms and Fe2P nanoparticles as robust coupling catalyst for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction</title>

Abstract
Development of low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance and high atomic economy electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and investigation of the related catalytic mechanism are of crucial importance yet such tasks are still challenging. Herein, we synthesized a highly dispersed N, P co&#8208;doped carbon frames (NPCFs) anchored with Fe single atoms (SAs) and Fe2P nanoparticles (NPs) coupling catalyst by a novel in situ&#8208;doping&#8208;adsorption&#8208;phosphatization strategy for electrocatalytic ORR. The Fe SAs&#8211;Fe2P NPs/NPCFs&#8208;2.5 catalyst shows a superior ORR activity with high E1/2 of 0.78 and 0.91&#160;V, low Tafel slope of 63.8 and 45.4 mV&#183;dec&#8211;1, and large JK of 2.46 and 14.47 mA&#183;cm&#8211;2 at 0.8 and 0.85&#160;V in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 0.1 M KOH, respectively, which surpasses most of the non&#8208;noble metal ORR catalysts, and is comparable to that of Pt/C. Density functional theory calculations reveal a synergistic effect that the existence of Fe2P weakens the adsorption of ORR intermediates on active sites and lowers the reaction free energy. The doped P atoms with a strong electron&#8208;donating ability would elevate the energy level of Fe&#8208;3d orbitals and facilitate the adsorption of O2. The active Fe atoms in Fe SAs&#8208;Fe2P NPs/NPCFs&#8208;2.5 exist in a low oxidation state and are less positively charged, which serve as an electron reservoir capable of donating and releasing electrons thus improving the ORR activity. Operando and in situ characterization results indicated that the atomically dispersed Fe&#8211;N4/Fe&#8211;P coupled active centers in Fe SAs&#8211;Fe2P NPs/NPCFs&#8208;2.5 catalyst is characteristic of different catalytic mechanisms in acidic and alkaline media. In 0.5 M H2SO4, the Fe&#8211;P site as an active site for the O2 adsorption&#8211;activation process, which is beneficial to the formation of P&#8211;Fe&#8211;O&#8211;H* intermediate species, and the O&#8211;H bond in P&#8211;Fe&#8211;O&#8211;H* can cleave to form spillover H species, which can in turn combine with another N4&#8211;Fe&#8211;O&#8211;H* intermediate species, accelerating the ORR progress. By contrast, in 0.1 M KOH, the Fe&#8211;P sites are not involved in the ORR process, but the doping of P atoms alters the electronic structure of the Fe&#8211;N4 center, thereby improving the ORR activity. This work proposes a novel idea for constructing coupling catalysts with atomic&#8208;level precision and provides a strong reference for the development of high&#8208;efficiency ORR electrocatalysts for practical application.

         <title>Direct Light Orbital Angular Momentum Detection in Mid&#8208;Infrared Based on Type&#8208;II Weyl Semimetal TaIrTe4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The direct photocurrent detection capability of light orbital angular momentum (OAM) has recently been realized with topological Weyl semimetals, but it is limited to the near&#8208;infrared wavelength range. The extension of the direct OAM detection capability to the mid&#8208;infrared band, which is a wave band that plays an important role in a vast range of applications, has not yet been realized. This is because the photocurrent responses of most photodetectors are neither sensitive to the phase information nor efficient in the mid&#8208;infrared region. In this study, a photodetector based on type&#8208;II Weyl semimetal tantalum iridium tellurides is designed with peculiar electrode geometries to directly detect the topological charge of the OAM using the orbital photogalvanic effect. Our results indicate that the helical phase gradient of light can be distinguished by a current winding around the optical beam axis, with a magnitude proportional to its quantized OAM mode number. The topologically enhanced responses in the mid&#8208;infrared region of TaIrTe4 further help overcome the low responsivity issues and finally render direct OAM detection capability. Our study enables on&#8208;chip integrated OAM detection, and thus OAM&#8208;sensitive focal plane arrays in the mid&#8208;infrared region.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;broadband Strong Electromagnetic Interference Shielding with Ferromagnetic Graphene Quartz Fabric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Flexible electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials with ultrahigh shielding effectiveness (SE) are highly desirable for high&#8208;speed electronic devices to attenuate radiated emissions. For hindering interference of their internal or external EMI fields, however, a metallic enclosure suffers from relatively low SE, band&#8208;limited anti&#8208;EMI responses, poor corrosion resistance, and non&#8208;adaptability to complex geometry of a given circuit. Here, we demonstrate a broadband, strong EMI shielding response fabric based on a highly structured ferromagnetic graphene quartz fiber (FGQF) via a modulation&#8208;doped chemical vapour deposition (CVD) growth process. The precise control of graphitic N&#8208;doping configuration endows graphene coatings on specifically designable quartz fabric weave with both high conductivity (3,906 S&#183;cm&#8211;1) and high magnetic responsiveness (a saturation magnetization of &#8764;0.14 emu / g under 300 k), thus attaining the synergistic effect of EMI shielding and electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption for broadband anti&#8208;EMI technology. The large&#8208;scale durable FGQF exhibits extraordinary EMI SE of &#8764;107&#160;dB over a broadband frequency (1&#8211;18&#160;GHz), by configurating &#8764;20&#160;nm thick graphene coatings on a millimeter&#8208;thick quartz fabric. Our work enables a potential for developing an industrial&#8208;scale, flexible, lightweight, durable and ultra&#8208;broadband strong shielding material in advanced applications of flexible anti&#8208;electronic reconnaissance, antiradiation and stealthy technologies.

         <title>Metamaterial Absorbers: from Tunable Surface to Structural Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Since the first demonstration, remarkable progress has been made in the theoretical analysis, structural design, numerical simulation, and potential applications of metamaterial absorbers (MAs). With the continuous advancement of novel materials and creative designs, the absorption of MAs has been significantly improved over a wide frequency spectrum from microwave to optical regime. Further, the integration of active elements into MAs design allows the dynamically manipulation of electromagnetic waves, opening a new platform to push the breakthrough in metadevices. In last several years, numerous efforts have been devoted to exploring innovative approaches for incorporating tunability to MAs, which is highly desirable because of the progressively increasing demand on designing versatile metadevices. In this review, a comprehensive and systematical overview of active MAs with adaptive and on&#8208;demand manner is revisited, highlighting innovative materials and unique strategies to precisely control the electromagnetic response. In addition to the mainstream method by manipulating periodic patterns, we call back two additional approaches including tailoring dielectric spacer and transforming overall structure. Following this, key parameters, such as operating frequency, relative tuning range, and switching speed, are summarized and compared to guide for optimum design. Finally, potential opportunities in the development of active MAs are discussed.

Asymmetric substitution of end&#8208;groups is first applied in molecular donors. Three commonly used end&#8208;groups of 2&#8208;ethylhexyl cyanoacetate (CA), 2&#8208;ethylhexyl rhodanine (Reh), and 1H&#8208;indene&#8208;1,3(2H)&#8208;dione (ID) are combined to construct a series of symmetric and asymmetric donors. Correspondingly, the asymmetric donors SM&#8208;CA&#8208;Reh and SM&#8208;CA&#8208;ID show largely increased dipole moments (2.14 D and 3.39 D respectively) and enhanced aggregation propensity, as compared to those of symmetric donors of SM&#8208;CA, SM&#8208;Reh, and SM&#8208;ID. Using N3 as acceptor, interestingly, SM&#8208;CA&#8208;Reh integrates the photovoltaic characteristics of high fill factor (FF) for SM&#8208;CA and high short&#8208;current density for SM&#8208;Reh, and delivers a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.34% with a high FF of 77.5%, which is much higher than 15.41% for SM&#8208;CA and 14.76% for SM&#8208;Reh. However, SM&#8208;CA&#8208;ID and SM&#8208;ID give the lower PCE of 8.20% and 2.76%. Characterization results suggest that the &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction dictates the packing morphology of blend films instead of dipole effect or crystallinity. Mono&#8208;substitution of Reh facilitates the molecular demixing appropriately but keeps the characteristic of fine bicontinuous network of SM&#8208;CA:N3. SM&#8208;CA&#8208;Reh:N3 shows more efficient exciton extraction, higher hole transport, and better miscibility, which explains the merits integration and improved photovoltaic performance.

&lt;p&gt;Asymmetric substitution of end-groups is first applied in molecular donors. Three commonly used end-groups of 2-ethylhexyl cyanoacetate (CA), 2-ethylhexyl rhodanine (Reh), and 1H-indene-1,3(2H)-dione (ID) are combined to construct a series of symmetric and asymmetric donors.

Using N3 as acceptor, interestingly, SM-CA-Reh integrates the photovoltaic characteristics of high fill factor (FF) for SM-CA and high short-current density for SM-Reh, and delivers a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.34% with a high FF of 77.5%, which is much higher than 15.41% for SM-CA and 14.76% for SM-Reh.

         <title>Engineering kesterite based photocathode for photoelectrochemical ammonia synthesis from NOx reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ammonia is a key chemical feedstock for industry as well as future carbon&#8208;free fuel and transportable vector for renewable energy. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) ammonia synthesis from NOx reduction reaction (NOxRR) provides not only a promising alternative to the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8208;Bosch process through direct solar&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion, but a sustainable solution for balancing the global nitrogen cycle by restoring ammonia from wastewater. In this work, we, for the first time, demonstrated selective ammonia synthesis from PEC NOxRR by kesterite (Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS)) photocathode through loading defect&#8208;engineered TiOx cocatalyst on CdS/CZTS photocathode (TiOx/CdS/CZTS). The uniquely designed photocathode enables selective ammonia production from NOxRR, yielding up to 89.1% faradaic efficiency (0.1&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) with a remarkable positive onset potential (0.38&#160;V versus RHE). By tailoring the amount of surface defective Ti3+ species, the adsorption of reactant NO3&#8211; and *NO2 intermediate is significantly promoted while the full coverage of TiOx also suppresses NO2&#8211; liberation as a by&#8208;product, contributing to high ammonia selectivity. Our further attempted PEC ammonia synthesis from simulated wastewater shows good faradaic efficiency of 64.9%, unveiling the potential of using kesterite based photocathode for sustainably restoring ammonia from nitrate&#8208;rich wastewater.

         <title>In&#8208;situ Synthesis of MOF&#8208;74 Family for High Areal Energy Density of Aqueous Nickel&#8208;Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Limited by single metal active sites and low electrical conductivity, designing nickel&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) materials with high capacity and high energy density remains a challenge. Herein, a series of bi/multimetallic MOF&#8208;74 family in situ grown on carbon cloth (CC) by doping Mx+ ions in Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 are fabricated, NiM&#8208;MOF@CC (M = Mn2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Al3+, Fe3+), and NiCoM&#8208;MOF@CC (M = Mn2+, Zn2+, Al3+, Fe3+). The type and ratio of doping metal ions can be adjusted while the original topology is preserved. Different metal ions are confirmed by X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS). Furthermore, these Ni&#8208;based MOF electrodes are directly utilized as cathodes for aqueous nickel&#8208;zinc batteries (NZBs). Among all the as&#8208;prepared electrodes, NiCo&#8208;MOF@CC&#8208;3 (NCM@CC&#8208;3) with an optimized Co/Ni ratio 1:1 exhibits the best electrical conductivity, which is according with the DFT theoretical calculations. The NCM@CC&#8208;3//Zn@CC battery achieves a high specific capacity of 1.77 mAh cm&#8211;2, a high areal energy density of 2.97 mWh cm&#8211;2, and high cycling stability of 83% capacity retention rate after 6000 cycles. The synthetic strategy based on the coordination effect of metal ions and the concept of binder&#8208;free electrodes, provides a new direction for the synthesis of high&#8208;performance materials in the energy storage field.

         <title>Isolated&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy Hardening in Lead&#8208;Free Piezoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Defect engineering is a well&#8208;established approach to customize the functionalities of perovskite oxides. In demanding high&#8208;power applications of piezoelectric materials; acceptor doping serves as the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hardening approach but inevitably deteriorates the electromechanical properties. Here; we propose a new hardening effect associated with the isolated oxygen vacancy for achieving well&#8208;balanced performances. Guided by theoretical design; a well&#8208;balanced performance of mechanical quality factor (Qm) and piezoelectric coefficient (d33) is achieved in lead&#8208;free potassium sodium niobate ceramics; where Qm increases by over 60% while d33 remains almost unchanged. By atomic&#8208;scale Z&#8208;contrast imaging; hysteresis measurement; and quantitative piezoresponse force microscopy analysis; we reveal that the improved Qm results from the inhibition of both extrinsic and intrinsic losses while the unchanged d33 is associated with the retainment of polarization contributes. More encouragingly; the hardening effect shows exceptional stability with increasing vibration velocity; offering the potential in material designing for practical high&#8208;power applications; such as pharmaceutical extraction and ultrasonic osteotome.

         <title>Highly Potassiophilic Graphdiyne Skeletons Decorated with Cu Quantum Dots Enable Dendrite&#8208;Free Potassium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Employing Al foil current collector at the potassium anode side is an ideal choice to entail low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;energy potassium metal battery (PMB). Nevertheless, the poor affinity between potassium and planar Al can cause uneven K plating/stripping and hence undermined anode performance, which remains a significant challenge to be addressed. Herein, we propose a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon@graphdiyne (NC@GDY) modified Al current collector affording potassiophilic properties that simultaneously suppresses the dendrite growth and prolongs the lifespan of K anodes. The thin and light modification layer (7&#160;&#956;m thick, with a mass loading of 500&#160;&#956;g cm&#8208;2) is fabricated by directly growing GDY nanosheets interspersed by Cu quantum dots on NC polyhedron templates. As a result, symmetric cell tests reveal that the K@NC@GDY&#8208;Al electrode exhibits an unprecedented cycle life of over 2400 h at a 40% depth of discharge. Even at an 80% depth of discharge, the cell can still sustain for 850 h. When paired with a potassium Prussian blue cathode, thus&#8208;assembled full cell demonstrates comparable capacity and rate performance with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PMBs.

         <title>Machine Learning on a Robotic Platform for the Design of Polymer&#8208;Protein Hybrids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polymer&#8208;protein hybrids are intriguing materials that can bolster protein stability in non&#8208;native environments, thereby enhancing their utility in diverse medicinal, commercial, and industrial applications. One stabilization strategy involves designing synthetic random copolymers with compositions attuned to the protein surface, but rational design is complicated by a vast chemical and composition space. Here, a strategy is reported to design protein&#8208;stabilizing copolymers based on active machine learning, facilitated by automated material synthesis and characterization platforms. The versatility and robustness of the approach is demonstrated by the successful identification of copolymers that preserve, or even enhance, the activity of three chemically distinct enzymes following exposure to thermal denaturing conditions. Although systematic screening results in mixed success, active learning appropriately identifies unique and effective copolymer chemistries for the stabilization of each enzyme. Overall, this work broadens our&#160;capabilities to design fit&#8208;for&#8208;purpose synthetic copolymers that promote or otherwise manipulate protein activity, with extensions towards the design of robust polymer&#8208;protein hybrid&#160;materials.

         <title>A print&#8208;and&#8208;fuse Strategy for Sacrificial Filaments Enables Biomimetically Structured Perfusable Microvascular Networks with Functional Endothelium Inside 3D Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Current methods of microvessel fabrication mostly rely on self&#8208;assembly in tiny volumes, prefabricated designs of microchannels, or demand complicated multi&#8208;step procedures based on sacrificial templating to achieve specific geometrical features. Such application&#8208;oriented geometries subsequently require a design&#8208;specific and functional perfusion system that must be developed in parallel. In this study, we present a facile and flexible approach for the integration of biomimetically branched microvasculature within bulk hydrogels. For this, sacrificial scaffolds of thermoresponsive poly(2&#8208;cyclopropyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PcycloPrOx) are created using Melt Electrowriting (MEW) in an optimized and predictable way and subsequently placed into a customized bioreactor system, which is then filled with a hydrogel precursor solution. Aqueous environment above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of PcycloPrOx at 25&#176;C swells the polymer without dissolving it, resulting in fusion of filaments that were deposited onto each other (print&#8208;and&#8208;fuse approach). Accordingly, an adequate printing pathway design results in generating physiological&#8208;like branchings and channel volumes which approximate Murray's law in the geometrical ratio between parent and daughter vessels. After gel formation, a temperature decrease below the LCST produces interconnected microchannels with distinct inlet and outlet regions. Initial placement of the sacrificial scaffolds in the bioreactors in a pre&#8208;defined manner directly yields perfusable structures via leakage&#8208;free fluid connections in a reproducible one&#8208;step procedure. Using this approach, rapid formation of a tight and biologically functional endothelial layer, as assessed not only through fluorescent dye diffusion, but also by tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#8208;&#945;) stimulation, is obtained within three days.

         <title>Recording Temperature with Magnetic Supraparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Small&#8208;sized temperature indicator additives autonomously record temperature events via a gradual irreversible signal change. This permits for instance the indication of possible cold&#8208;chain breaches or failure of electronics but also curing of glues. Thus, information about the materials&#8217; thermal history can be obtained upon signal detection at every point of interest. In this work, we introduce maximum&#8208;temperature indicators with magnetic readout based on micrometer&#8208;sized supraparticles. The magnetic signal transduction is by nature independent of the materials&#8217; optical properties. This facilitates to obtain valuable temperature information from the inside, i.e., bulk, even of dark and opaque macroscopic objects, which might differ from their surface. Compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art optical temperature indicators, complementary magnetic readout characteristics ultimately expand their applicability. The conceptualized supraparticles are hierarchically structured assemblies of environmentally friendly, inexpensive iron oxide nanoparticles and thermoplastic polymer. Irreversible structural changes, induced by polymer softening, yield magnetic interaction changes within and between the hierarchic sub&#8208;structures, which are distinguishable and define the temperature indication mechanism. The fundamental understanding of the supraparticles&#8217; working principle enabled us to customize the particles&#8217; working range, response time, and sensitivity, using a toolbox&#8208;like manufacturing approach. The magnetic signal change is detected self&#8208;referenced, fast and contactless.

         <title>Recent progress in 1D contacts for 2D material&#8208;based devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Recent studies have intensively examined two&#8208;dimensional materials (2DMs) as promising materials for use in future quantum devices due to their atomic thinness. However, a major limitation occurs when 2DMs are in contact with metals; a van der Waals (vdW) gap is generated at the 2DM&#8208;metal interfaces, which induces metal&#8208;induced gap states that are responsible for uncontrollable Schottky barrier (SB), Fermi&#8208;level pinning (FLP), and high contact resistance (RC), thereby substantially lower the electronic mobility of 2DM&#8208;based devices. Here, vdW gap&#8208;free one&#8208;dimensional (1D) edge contact has been studied for use in 2D devices with substantially suppressed carrier scattering of 2DMs with hexagonal boron&#8208;nitride (hBN) encapsulation. The 1D contact further enables uniform carrier transport across multi&#8208;layered 2DM channels, high density transistor integration independent of scaling, and the fabrication of double gate transistors suitable for demonstrating unique quantum phenomena of 2DMs. In this paper, we review the existing 1D contact methods first. As a promising technology toward the large&#8208;scale production of 2D devices, seamless lateral contacts are reviewed in detail. We subsequently review the electronic, optoelectronic, and quantum devices developed via 1D contacts. Finally, we address the challenges regarding the reliability of 1D contacts, followed by an outlook of the 1D contact methods.

         <title>Compact modeling technology for the simulation of integrated circuits based on graphene field&#8208;effect transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In this study, we report the progress made towards the definition of a modular compact modeling technology for graphene field&#8208;effect transistors (GFET) that enables the electrical analysis of arbitrary GFET&#8208;based integrated circuits. A set of primary models embracing the main physical principles defines the ideal GFET response under DC, transient (time domain), AC (frequency domain), and noise (frequency domain) analysis. Other set of secondary models accounts for the GFET non&#8208;idealities, such as extrinsic&#8208;, short&#8208;channel&#8208;, trapping/detrapping&#8208;, self&#8208;heating&#8208;, and non&#8208;quasi static&#8208;effects, which could have a significant impact under static and/or dynamic operation. At both device and circuit levels, significant consistency is demonstrated between the simulation output and experimental data for relevant operating conditions. Additionally, we provide a perspective of the challenges during the scale up of the GFET modeling technology towards higher technology readiness levels while drawing a collaborative scenario among fabrication technology groups, modeling groups, and circuit designers.

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide with increased entropy for piezoelectric electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Piezoelectricity in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has attracted considerable interest because of their excellent flexibility and high piezoelectric coefficient compared to the conventional piezoelectric bulk materials. However, the ability to regulate the piezoelectric properties is limited because the entropy is constant for certain binary TMDs other than multielement ones. Herein, in order to increase the entropy, the ternary TMDs alloy, Mo1&#8208;xWxS2 with different W concentrations, is synthesized. The W concentration in the Mo1&#8208;xWxS2 alloy can be controlled precisely in the low&#8208;supersaturation synthesis and the entropy can be tuned accordingly. The Mo0.46W0.54S2 alloy (x = 0.54) has the highest configurational entropy and best piezoelectric properties such as a piezoelectric coefficient of 4.22 pm V&#8211;1 and a piezoelectric output current of 150 pA at 0.24% strain. More importantly, it can be combined into a larger package to increase the output current to 600 pA to cater to self&#8208;powered applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piezoelectricity in two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has attracted considerable interest because of their excellent flexibility and high piezoelectric coefficient compared to the conventional piezoelectric bulk materials. However, the ability to regulate the piezoelectric properties is limited because the entropy is constant for certain binary TMDs other than multielement ones. Herein, in order to increase the entropy, the ternary TMDs alloy, Mo&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with different W concentrations, is synthesized. The W concentration in the Mo&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; alloy can be controlled precisely in the low-supersaturation synthesis and the entropy can be tuned accordingly. The Mo&lt;sub&gt;0.46&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;0.54&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; alloy (x = 0.54) has the highest configurational entropy and best piezoelectric properties such as a piezoelectric coefficient of 4.22 pm V&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a piezoelectric output current of 150 pA at 0.24% strain. More importantly, it can be combined into a larger package to increase the output current to 600 pA to cater to self-powered applications. Combining with excellent mechanical durability, a mechanical sensor based on the Mo&lt;sub&gt;0.46&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;0.54&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; alloy has been demonstrated for real-time health monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Dual Ligands Strategy to Regulate the Nucleation and Growth of Lead Chromate Photoanode for Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>

Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting for renewable hydrogen production has been regarded as a promising solution to utilize solar energy. However, most of the photoelectrodes still suffer from poor film quality and poor charge separation properties, mainly owing to the possible formation of detrimental defects including microcracks and grain boundaries. Herein, we developed a molecular coordination engineering strategy by employing acetylacetone (Acac) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) dual ligands to regulate the nucleation and crystal growth of lead chromate (PbCrO4) photoanode, resulting in the formation of a high&#8208;quality film with large grain size, well&#8208;stitched grain boundaries and reduced oxygen vacancies defects. With these efforts, the non&#8208;radiative charge recombination was efficiently suppressed, leading to the enhancement of its charge separation efficiency from 47% to 90%. After decorating with Co&#8208;Pi co&#8208;catalyst, the PbCrO4 photoanode achieves a photocurrent density of 3.15&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 at 1.23&#160;V (versus RHE under simulated AM1.5G) and an applied bias photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency (ABPE) of 0.82%. Our work provides a new strategy to modulate the nucleation and growth of high&#8208;quality photoelectrodes for efficient PEC water splitting.

         <title>High Performance Narrowband Pure&#8208;red OLEDs with External Quantum Efficiencies up to 36.1% and Ultra&#8208;low Efficiency Roll&#8208;off</title>

Abstract
High color&#8208;purity blue and green organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) have been resolved thanks to the development of B/N&#8208;based polycyclic multiple resonance (MR) emitters. However, due to the derivatization limit of B/N polycyclic structures, the design of red MR emitters remains challenging. Herein, we report a series of novel red MR emitters by para&#8208;positioning N&#8208;&#960;&#8208;N, O&#8208;&#960;&#8208;O, B&#8208;&#960;&#8208;B pairs onto a benzene ring to construct a MR central core. These emitters can be facilely and modularly synthesized, allowing for easy fine&#8208;tuning of emission spectra by peripheral groups. Moreover, these red MR emitters display excellent photophysical properties such as near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), fast radiative decay rate (kr) up to 7.4 &#8569; 107 s&#8722;1, and most importantly, narrowband emission with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 32&#160;nm. Incorporating these MR emitters, pure red OLEDs sensitized by phosphor realize state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device performances with external quantum efficiency (EQE) exceeding 36%, ultra&#8208;low efficiency roll&#8208;off (EQE remains as high as 25.1% at the brightness of 50000&#160;cd m&#8722;2), ultra&#8208;high brightness over 130000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, together with good device lifetime.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Level Methylcellulose/MXene Hybrids with Greatly Enhanced Electrochemical Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ti3C2Tx MXene film is promising for electrochemical actuators due to its high electrical conductivity and volumetric capacitance. However, its actuation performance is limited by the slow ion diffusion through the film and poor mechanical property in aqueous electrolytes. Here, molecular&#8208;level methylcellulose/MXene hybrid films are assembled with obviously enlarged layer distance, improved wet strength and ambient stability. The hybrid films show significantly higher in&#8208;plane actuation strain in a liquid electrolyte. Based on direct strain measurements, in&#8208;situ XRD and ex&#8208;situ XPS analyses, the actuation enhancement can be ascribed to the enlarged layer distance allowing more water and ions to be intercalated/deintercalated and methylcellulose&#8208;induced sliding of MXene sheets. The assembled soft actuator has a high Young's modulus of 1.93&#160;GPa and can be operated in air, generating a peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak strain difference up to 0.541% under a triangular wave voltage of &#177;1&#160;V&#160;and a blocking force of 4.7 times its own weight.
