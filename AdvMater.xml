      <title>Hetero&#8208;MXenes: Theory, Synthesis, and Emerging Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
A comprehensive overview of hetero&#8208;MXenes, from theoretical predictions to experimental investigations, is presented. The reviewed theoretical calculations focus on three sites of MXenes and the reviewed metal&#8208;/nonmetal&#8208;doped/substituted MXenes are experimentally synthesized by in situ/ex situ strategies. It is believed that this work will be beneficial to bridge the predictions and experiments, further promoting the development of hetero&#8208;MXenes.








Abstract
Since their discovery in 2011, MXenes (abbreviation for transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides) have emerged as a rising star in the family of 2D materials owing to their unique properties. Although the primary research interest is still focused on pristine MXenes and their composites, much attention has in recent years been paid also to MXenes with diverse compositions. To this end, this work offers a comprehensive overview of the progress on compositional engineering of MXenes in terms of doping and substituting from theoretical predictions to experimental investigations. Synthesis and properties are briefly introduced for pristine MXenes and then reviewed for hetero&#8208;MXenes. Theoretical calculations regarding the doping/substituting at M, X, and T sites in MXenes and the role of vacancies are summarized. After discussing the synthesis of hetero&#8208;MXenes with metal/nonmetal (N, S, P) elements by in situ and ex situ strategies, the focus turns to their emerging applications in various fields such as energy storage, electrocatalysts, and sensors. Finally, challenges and prospects of hetero&#8208;MXenes are addressed. It is anticipated that this review will be beneficial to bridge the gap between predictions and experiments as well as to guide the future design of hetero&#8208;MXenes with high performance.

      <title>Design, Fabrication, and Mechanism of Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Graphene&#8208;Based Photocatalyst</title>
      <dc:description>
Nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene plays a significant role in photocatalysis. Rational design, preparation, and understanding the mechanism of N&#8208;doped graphene&#8208;based photocatalyst provide a new opportunity to further enhance the photocatalytic performance. The research progress, atomic and band structures, photocatalytic mechanism, synthesis strategy, unique advantages, and wide application of N&#8208;doped graphene in photocatalysis are highlighted.








Abstract
Solving energy and environmental problems through solar&#8208;driven photocatalysis is an attractive and challenging topic. Hence, various types of photocatalysts have been developed successively to address the demands of photocatalysis. Graphene&#8208;based materials have elicited considerable attention since the discovery of graphene. As a derivative of graphene, nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (NG) particularly stands out. Nitrogen atoms can break the undifferentiated structure of graphene and open the bandgap while endowing graphene with an uneven electron density distribution. Therefore, NG retains nearly all the advantages of original graphene and is equipped with several novel properties, ensuring infinite possibilities for NG&#8208;based photocatalysis. This review introduces the atomic and band structures of NG, summarizes in situ and ex situ synthesis methods, highlights the mechanism and advantages of NG in photocatalysis, and outlines its applications in different photocatalysis directions (primarily hydrogen production, CO2 reduction, pollutant degradation, and as photoactive ingredient). Lastly, the central challenges and possible improvements of NG&#8208;based photocatalysis in the future are presented. This study is expected to learn from the past and achieve progress toward the future for NG&#8208;based photocatalysis.

      <dc:description>
Paper&#8208;based fully roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll manufactured flexible lightweight large&#8208;area piezoelectric transducers are presented. Embedding the printed electronic layers into conventional paper webs by inline lamination and inline poling leads to piezoelectric devices with high remnant polarization and high production yield. The development gives the opportunity i.a. for novel surround sound installations of several meter length.








Abstract
The trend to a world with ubiquitous electronics has the need for novel concepts for sensors and actuators that are lightweight, flexible, low&#8208;cost, and also sustainable. Piezoelectric transducers on the basis of functional polymers can meet these expectations. In this work, a novel concept for paper&#8208;embedded large&#8208;area piezoelectric devices realized solely by means of roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll (R2R) mass printing and post printing technologies including inline poling are introduced. The device set&#8208;up, as well as the process technology, offers the great opportunity for a cost&#8208;efficient and environmentally friendly mass production of thin and flexible organic large&#8208;area piezoelectric devices. As the functional layers are embedded into paper by the hot lamination of two poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene) P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) layers, the printed electronics is protected and invisible. The paper gives insights to the R2R printing of a 500 m long web including R2R post printing processes and electrical and acoustic inline characterization. Fully R2R processed devices show a high remnant polarization of up to 78&#160;mC&#160;m&#8722;2 and can be realized with high yield of &gt;90%.&#160;Finally, a 360&#176; surround&#8208;sound installation realized with a 387&#160;cm long paper web consisting of 56 piezoelectric speakers including wiring is presented.

      <title>Lattice Matching Growth of Conductive Hierarchical Porous MOF/LDH Heteronanotube Arrays for Highly Efficient Water Oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>
Porous metal&#8211;organic framework/layered double hydroxide (MOF/LDH) hierarchical heteronanotube arrays consisting of a lattice&#8208;matched 2D conductive MOF and a trimetallic LDH, established by an inner template sacrifice process, enable excellent activity and superior stability toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) reaction among the best MOF and non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts for OER.








Abstract
The conjugation of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) into different multicomponent materials to precisely construct aligned heterostructures is fascinating but elusive owing to the disparate interfacial energy and nucleation kinetics. Herein, a promising lattice&#8208;matching growth strategy is demonstrated for conductive MOF/layered double hydroxide (cMOF/LDH) heteronanotube arrays with highly ordered hierarchical porous structures enabling an ultraefficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER). CoNiFe&#8208;LDH nanowires are used as interior template to engineer an interface by inlaying cMOF and matching two crystal lattice systems, thus conducting a graft growth of cMOF/LDH heterostructures along the LDH nanowire. A class of hierarchical porous cMOF/LDH heteronanotube arrays is produced through continuously regulating the transformation degree. The synergistic effects of the cMOF and LDH components significantly promote the chemical and electronic structures of the heteronanotube arrays and their electroactive surface area. Optimized heteronanotube arrays exhibit extraordinary OER activity with ultralow overpotentials of 216 and 227&#160;mV to deliver current densities of 50 and 100 mA cm&#8722;2 with a small Tafel slope of 34.1 mV dec&#8722;1, ranking it among the best MOF and non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts for OER. The robust performance under high current density and vigorous gas bubble conditions enable such hierarchical MOF/LDH heteronanotube arrays as promising materials for practical water electrolysis.

      <title>New Frontiers in 3D Structural Sensing Robots</title>
      <dc:description>
Sensing robots synergically merge 3D integrated sensors and robotics. Geometrical difficulty from the structural complexity of sensing robots has been the main challenge in the production of sensing robots. 3D integrated electronics prepared by 3D printing is a potential solution for realistic sensing robot systems. The platform of 3D sensing systems is investigated, and their expansion into sensing robots is studied further in practical settings such as in healthcare and manufacturing units.

Abstract
Advanced robotics is the result of various contributions from complex fields of science and engineering and has tremendous value in human society. Sensing robots are highly desirable in practical settings such as healthcare and manufacturing sectors through sensing activities from human&#8211;robot interaction. However, there are still ongoing research and technical challenges in the development of ideal sensing robot systems. The sensing robot should synergically merge sensors and robotics. Geometrical difficulty in the sensor positioning caused by the structural complexity of sensing robots and their corresponding processing have been the main challenges in the production of sensing robots. 3D electronics integrated into 3D objects prepared by the 3D printing process can be the potential solution for designing realistic sensing robot systems. 3D printing provides the advantage to manufacture complex 3D structures in electronics in a single setup, allowing the ease of design flexibility, and customized functions. Therefore, the platform of 3D sensing systems is investigated and their expansion into sensing robots is studied further. The progress toward sensing robots from 3D electronics integrated into 3D objects and the advanced material strategies, used to overcome the challenges, are discussed.

      <title>A Brief History of OLEDs&#8212;Emitter Development and Industry Milestones</title>
      <dc:description>
The history of emitter development and industry's interest in organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) technology are reviewed. OLED device technology has equally inspired and driven innovation in academia and industry. Three generations of emitters based on different emission mechanisms are designed. Recently, research in both academia and industry points towards a fourth generation of light&#8208;emitting materials for OLEDs.








Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) have come a long way ever since their first introduction in 1987 at Eastman Kodak. Today, OLEDs are especially valued in the display and lighting industry for their promising features. As one of the research fields that equally inspires and drives development in academia and industry, OLED device technology has continuously evolved over more than 30&#160;years. OLED devices have come forward based on three generations of emitter materials relying on fluorescence (first generation), phosphorescence (second generation), and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (third generation). Furthermore, research in academia and industry toward the fourth generation of OLEDs is in progress. Excerpts from the history of green, orange&#8208;red, and blue OLED emitter development on the side of academia and milestones achieved by key players in the industry are included in this report.

      <title>Micellar Lyotropic Nematic Gels</title>
      <dc:description>
By adding low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelators to lyotropic nematic phases a new kind of liquid crystal network, namely lyotropic nematic physical gels, is obtained. These lyotropic nematic gels combine anisotropy with mechanical stability and are promising new materials for the field of soft robotics and biomimetic actuation.








Abstract
Lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) gels are a new class of liquid crystal (LC) networks that combine the anisotropy of micellar LLCs with the mechanical stability of a gel. However, so far, only micellar LLC gels with lamellar and hexagonal structures have been obtained by the addition of gelators to LLCs. Here, the first examples of lyotropic nematic gels are presented. The key to obtain these nematic gels is the use of gelators that have a non&#8208;amphiphilic molecular structure and thus leave the size and shape of the micellar aggregates essentially unchanged. By adding these gelators to lyotropic nematic phases, an easy and reproducible way to obtain large amounts of lyotropic nematic gels is established. These nematic gels preserve the long&#8208;range orientational order and optical birefringence of a lyotropic nematic phase but have the mechanical stability of a gel. LLC nematic gels are promising new materials for elastic and anisotropic hydrogels to be applied as water&#8208;based stimuli&#8208;responsive actuators and sensors.

LLC nematic gels are promising new materials for elastic and anisotropic hydrogels to be applied as water&#8208;based stimuli&#8208;responsive actuators and sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inelastic Electron Tunneling Spectroscopy at High&#8208;Temperatures</title>
      <dc:description>
Inelastic tunneling spectroscopy is shown to be a viable high&#8208;resolution technique to analyze mobile species in solids at high&#8208;temperatures. In the measurements reported, BaZrO3&#8208;based heterostructures are used as proton conductors and tunnel barriers. By analyzing O&#63743;H bond vibrations at 400 K, the existence of protons in the tunnel barriers is demonstrated.








Abstract
Ion conducting materials are critical components of batteries, fuel cells, and devices such as memristive switches. Analytical tools are therefore sought that allow the behavior of ions in solids to be monitored and analyzed with high spatial resolution and in real time. In principle, inelastic tunneling spectroscopy offers these capabilities. However, as its spectral resolution is limited by thermal softening of the Fermi&#8211;Dirac distribution, tunneling spectroscopy is usually constrained to cryogenic temperatures. This constraint would seem to render tunneling spectroscopy useless for studying ions in motion. Here, the first inelastic tunneling spectroscopy studies above room temperature are reported. For these measurements, high&#8208;temperature&#8208;stable tunnel junctions that incorporate within the tunnel barrier ultrathin layers for efficient proton conduction are developed. By analyzing the vibrational modes of O&#63743;H bonds in BaZrO3&#8208;based heterostructures, the detection of protons with a spectral resolution of 20 meV at 400 K (full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half maximum) is demonstrated. Overturning the hitherto existing prediction for the spectral resolution limit of 186 meV (5.4 kBT ) at 400 K, this resolution enables high&#8208;temperature tunneling spectroscopy of ion conductors. With these advances, inelastic tunneling spectroscopy constitutes a novel, valuable analytical tool for solid&#8208;state ionics.

      <title>A Programmable DNA&#8208;Silicification&#8208;Based Nanocavity for Single&#8208;Molecule Plasmonic Sensing</title>
      <dc:description>
Integrating advances in DNA nanotechnology and plasmonic sensing, this study reports a method, termed DNA&#8208;silicified template for Raman optical beacon (DNA&#8208;STROBE), for development of ultrasmall and structurally resilient nanocavities with high fidelity. The DNA&#8208;STROBE constructs exhibit large, controlled local electromagnetic field enhancement for reproducible single&#8208;molecule surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopic sensing even at elevated background concentrations.








Abstract
Plasmonic nanocavities are highly desirable for optical sensing because of their singular ability to confine light into deep subwavelength volumes. Yet, it remains profoundly challenging to fabricate structurally resilient nanocavities with high fidelity, and to obtain direct, noninvasive visualization of the plasmonic hotspots within such constructs. Herein, highly precise and robust nanocavities, entitled DNA&#8208;silicified template for Raman optical beacon (DNA&#8208;STROBE), are engineered by using silicified DNA scaffolds for spatial organization of discrete plasmonic nanoparticles. In addition to substantially enhancing structural stability and chemical inertness, DNA silicification significantly improves nanogap control, resulting simultaneously in large and controlled local electromagnetic field enhancement. The ultrasmall mode volume of the DNA&#8208;STROBE constructs promotes single&#8208;molecule occupancy enabling surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) observations of single&#8208;molecule activity even at elevated background concentration, significantly relaxing the restrictive pico&#8208; to nanomolar molecular concentration condition typically required for such investigations. Additionally, leveraging super&#8208;resolution SERS measurements allows noninvasive and diffraction&#8208;unlimited spatial profiling of otherwise unresolvable plasmonic hotspots. The highly programmable and reproducible nature of the DNA&#8208;STROBE, coupled with its quantitative label&#8208;free molecular readouts, provides a versatile platform with applications across the spectrum of nanophotonics and biomedical sciences.

      <title>Structure Design of Long&#8208;Life Spinel&#8208;Oxide Cathode Materials for Magnesium Rechargeable Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Defect spinel ZnMnO3 with cation deficiencies at octahedral sites allows highly reversible Mg insertion/extraction avoiding the irreversible transformation into a rocksalt phase. It is successfully demonstrated that the material can work as a high&#8208;performance cathode for magnesium rechargeable batteries exhibiting high potential (&#8776;2.5&#160;V vs Mg2+/Mg) and capacity (&#8776;100&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1) with long&#8208;term cyclability.








Abstract
Development of metal&#8208;anode rechargeable batteries is a challenging issue. Especially, magnesium rechargeable batteries are promising in that Mg metal can be free from dendrite formation upon charging. However, in case of oxide cathode materials, inserted magnesium tends to form MgO&#8208;like rocksalt clusters in a parent phase even with another structure, which causes poor cyclability. Here, a design concept of high&#8208;performance cathode materials is shown, based on: i) selecting an element to destabilize the rocksalt&#8208;type structure and ii) utilizing the defect&#8208;spinel&#8208;type structure both to avoid the spinel&#8208;to&#8208;rocksalt reaction and to secure the migration path of Mg cations. This theoretical and experimental work substantiates that a defect&#8208;spinel&#8208;type ZnMnO3 meets the above criteria and shows excellent cycle performance exceeding 100 cycles upon Mg insertion/extraction with high potential (&#8776;2.5&#160;V vs Mg2+/Mg) and capacity (&#8776;100&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1). Thus, this work would provide a design guideline of cathode materials for various multivalent rechargeable batteries.

The single&#8208;step growth of alloy/alloy (MoS2(1&#8208;x)Se2x/SnS2(1&#8208;y)Se2y) vertical heterostructures is demonstrated and the heterostructure exhibits nearly intrinsic Van der Waals (vdW) interface in terms of a near&#8208;atomically sharp and defect&#8208;free boundary along the interface as well as a well&#8208;aligned epitaxial relationship. The almost&#8208;ideal interface enables the identification of the intrinsic behaviors of the heterostructures such as the band alignment, charge transfer, and carrier transport.








Abstract
The interfacial tunable band alignment of heterostructures is coveted in device design and optimization of device performance. As an intentional approach, alloying allows band engineering and continuous band&#8208;edge tunability for low&#8208;dimensional semiconductors. Thus, combining the tunability of alloying with the band structure of a heterostructure is highly desirable for the improvement of device characteristics. In this work, the single&#8208;step growth of alloy&#8208;to&#8208;alloy (MoS2(1&#8208;x)Se2x/SnS2(1&#8208;y)Se2y) 2D vertical heterostructures is demonstrated. Electron diffraction reveals the well&#8208;aligned heteroepitaxial relationship for the heterostructure, and a near&#8208;atomically sharp and defect&#8208;free boundary along the interface is observed. The nearly intrinsic van der Waals (vdW) interface enables measurement of the intrinsic behaviors of the heterostructures. The optimized type&#8208;II band alignment for the MoS2(1&#8208;x)Se2x/SnS2(1&#8208;y)Se2y heterostructure, along with the large band offset and effective charge transfer, is confirmed through quenched PL spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations. Devices based on completely stacked heterostructures show one or two orders enhanced electron&#160;mobility and rectification ratio than those of the constituent materials. The realization of device&#8208;quality alloy&#8208;to&#8208;alloy heterostructures provides a new material platform for precisely tuning band alignment and optimizing device applications.

      <title>3D&#8208;Printable Fluoropolymer Gas Diffusion Layers for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
      <dc:description>
Multiscale structural control in 3D&#8208;printable fluoropolymers enables highly tunable gas diffusion electrodes. By modulating the diffusion of reactants to and products from the catalyst layer during electroreduction, the product distribution in favor of higher carbon products is shifted. Insights into the rational design of electrodes offer a platform for developing and optimizing next&#8208;generation flow reactors.








Abstract
The electrosynthesis of value&#8208;added multicarbon products from CO2 is a promising strategy to shift chemical production away from fossil fuels. Particularly important is the rational design of gas diffusion electrode (GDE) assemblies to react selectively, at scale, and at high rates. However, the understanding of the gas diffusion layer (GDL) in these assemblies is limited for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR): particularly important, but incompletely understood, is how the GDL modulates product distributions of catalysts operating in high current density regimes &gt; 300&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Here, 3D&#8208;printable fluoropolymer GDLs with tunable microporosity and structure are reported and probe the effects of permeance, microstructural porosity, macrostructure, and surface morphology. Under a given choice of applied electrochemical potential and electrolyte, a 100&#215; increase in the C2H4:CO ratio due to GDL surface morphology design over a homogeneously porous equivalent and a 1.8&#215; increase in the C2H4 partial current density due to a pyramidal macrostructure are observed. These findings offer routes to improve CO2RR GDEs as a platform for 3D catalyst design.

&lt;p&gt;Multiscale structural control in 3D&#8208;printable fluoropolymers enables highly tunable gas diffusion electrodes. By modulating the diffusion of reactants to and products from the catalyst layer during electroreduction, the product distribution in favor of higher carbon products is shifted. Insights into the rational design of electrodes offer a platform for developing and optimizing next&#8208;generation flow reactors.

      <title>MnO2&#8208;Based Materials for Environmental Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
The recent experimental and computational research progress on modulation of MnO2 single&#8208;species and MnO2&#8208;based composites for environmental applications are summarized. MnO2 single&#8208;species can be modified through morphology control, structure construction, facet engineering, and element doping while MnO2&#8208;based composites can be tuned by construction of homojunctions, MnO2/semiconductor/conductor binary heterojunctions, and MnO2&#8208;based ternary heterojunctions.








Abstract
Manganese dioxide (MnO2) is a promising photo&#8211;thermo&#8211;electric&#8208;responsive semiconductor material for environmental applications, owing to its various favorable properties. However, the unsatisfactory environmental purification efficiency of this material has limited its further applications. Fortunately, in the last few years, significant efforts have been undertaken for improving the environmental purification efficiency of this material and understanding its underlying mechanism. Here, the aim is to summarize the recent experimental and computational research progress in the modification of MnO2 single species by morphology control, structure construction, facet engineering, and element doping. Moreover, the design and fabrication of MnO2&#8208;based composites via the construction of homojunctions and MnO2/semiconductor/conductor binary/ternary heterojunctions is discussed. Their applications in environmental purification systems, either as an adsorbent material for removing heavy metals, dyes, and microwave (MW) pollution, or as a thermal catalyst, photocatalyst, and electrocatalyst for the degradation of pollutants (water and gas, organic and inorganic) are also highlighted. Finally, the research gaps are summarized and a perspective on the challenges and the direction of future research in nanostructured MnO2&#8208;based materials in the field of environmental applications is presented. Therefore, basic guidance for rational design and fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency MnO2&#8208;based materials for comprehensive environmental applications is provided.

      <title>Challenges and Strategies toward Cathode Materials for Rechargeable Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent advances in the design of cathode materials for potassium&#8208;ion batteries involving the use of hexacyanometalates, layered metal oxides, polyanionic frameworks, and organic compounds are reviewed. Particular emphasis is given to the intercalation reaction mechanism and the existing challenges and corresponding optimized strategies pertaining to cathode materials. Finally, an outlook of future perspectives for emerging potassium&#8208;ion batteries is presented.








Abstract
With increasing demand for grid&#8208;scale energy storage, potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) have emerged as promising complements or alternatives to commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries owing to the low cost, natural abundance of potassium resources, the low standard reduction potential of potassium, and fascinating K+ transport kinetics in the electrolyte. However, the low energy density and unstable cycle life of cathode materials hamper their practical application. Therefore, cathode materials with high capacities, high redox potentials, and good structural stability are required with the advancement toward next&#8208;generation PIBs. To this end, understanding the structure&#8208;dependent intercalation electrochemistry and recognizing the existing issues relating to cathode materials are indispensable prerequisites. This review summarizes the recent advances of PIB cathode materials, including metal hexacyanometalates, layered metal oxides, polyanionic frameworks, and organic compounds, with an emphasis on the structural advantages of the K+ intercalation reaction. Moreover, major current challenges with corresponding strategies for each category of cathode materials are highlighted. Finally, future research directions and perspectives are presented to accelerate the development of PIBs and facilitate commercial applications. It is believed that this review will provide practical guidance for researchers engaged in developing next&#8208;generation advanced PIB cathode materials.

      <title>Liquid Metals: A Novel Possibility of Fabricating 2D Metal Oxides</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent advances in the fabrication of 2D metal oxides (2DMOs) via liquid metals are comprehensively reviewed. The introduction of progress in fabricating 2DMOs by virtue of the features of liquid metals improves diversity in the development and applications of 2DMOs. The current challenges concerning the fabrication of 2DMOs are discussed to promote future research.








Abstract
2D metal oxides (2DMOs) have been widely applied in the fields of electronic, magnetic, optical, and catalytic materials, owing to their rich surface chemistry and unique electronic structures. However, their further development faces challenges such as the difficulty in fabricating 2DMOs with unstable surface induced by strong surface polarizability, or the high cost and limited yield of the fabrication process. Recently, liquid metals have shown great potential in the fabrication of 2DMOs. The native oxide skin formed on the surface of liquid metals can be considered as a perfect 2D planar material. Due to the solubility, fluidity, and reactivity of liquid metals, they can act as the solvent, reactant, and interface in the fabrication of 2DMOs. Moreover, liquid metals undergo a liquid&#8211;solid phase transition, enabling them to be a symmetric matched substrate for growing high&#8208;quality 2DMOs. An insightful survey of the recent progress in this research direction is presented. The features of liquid metals including good solubility, chemical reactivity, weak interface force, and liquid&#8211;solid phase transitions are introduced in detail. Furthermore, strategies for the fabrication of 2DMOs by virtue of these features are summarized comprehensively. Finally, current challenges and prospects regarding the future development in the fabrication of 2DMOs via liquid metals are highlighted.

      <title>Controllable Capillary Assembly of Magnetic Ellipsoidal Janus Particles into Tunable Rings, Chains and Hexagonal Lattices</title>
      <dc:description>
Magnetic ellipsoidal Janus particles assemble into rings, chains, and hexagonal&#8208;lattice structures at fluid&#8211;fluid interfaces driven by capillary interactions, where a dynamical transition between these assembly states can be obtained by dynamically manipulating the external magnetic field.








Abstract
Colloidal assembly at fluid interfaces has a great potential for the bottom&#8208;up fabrication of novel structured materials. However, challenges remain in realizing controllable and tunable assembly of particles into diverse structures. Herein, the capillary assembly of magnetic ellipsoidal Janus particles at a fluid&#8211;fluid interface is reported. Depending on their tilt angle, that is, the angle the particle main axis forms with the fluid interface, these particles deform the interface and generate capillary dipoles or hexapoles. Driven by capillary interactions, multiple particles thus assemble into chain&#8208;, hexagonal&#8208;lattice&#8208;, and ring&#8208;like structures, which can be actively controlled by applying an external magnetic field. A field&#8208;strength phase diagram is predicted in which various structures are present as stable states. Owing to the diversity, controllability, and tunability of assembled structures, magnetic ellipsoidal Janus particles at fluid interfaces could therefore serve as versatile building blocks for novel&#160;materials.

Owing to the diversity, controllability, and tunability of assembled structures, magnetic ellipsoidal Janus particles at fluid interfaces could therefore serve as versatile building blocks for novel&#160;materials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;Mediated Delivery of Inhaled Immunotherapeutics for Treating Lung Metastasis</title>
      <dc:description>
A noninvasive inhaled immunotherapeutic chitosan (CS)&#8211;antibody complex is developed for immunotherapy against lung cancer. In this system, CS with adjuvant effect is able to assemble with anti&#8208;programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (aPDL1) to enable efficient transmucosal delivery, which is promising for immunotherapy against lung metastasis without the concern of systemic toxicity.








Abstract
Despite the critical breakthrough achieved by immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), the clinical benefits are usually restricted by inefficient infiltration of immune cells and immune&#8208;associated adverse effects. Noninvasive aerosol inhalation, as a definitive procedure for treatment of respiratory diseases, for ICB immunotherapy against lung metastasis, has not been realized to the best knowledge. Herein, an inhaled immunotherapeutic chitosan (CS)&#8211;antibody complex is developed for immunotherapy against lung cancer. In this system, CS is used as a carrier to assemble with anti&#8208;programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (aPD&#8208;L1) to enable efficient transmucosal delivery. Moreover, CS exhibits adjuvant effects to drive potent immune responses via activating the cyclic&#8208;di&#8208;GMP&#8208;AMP synthase (cGAS)&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway. Interestingly, repeated inhalation of CS/aPD&#8208;L1 complex can effectively activate the immune system by promoting the infiltration of different immune cells especially CD8+ T cells around tumor lesions, and finally prolongs the survival of mice to 60 days. Thus, the work presents a unique aerosol inhalation delivery system for ICB antibody, which is promising for immunotherapy against lung metastasis without the concern of systemic toxicity.

      <title>Simultaneous Incorporation of Two Types of Azo&#8208;Groups in the Side Chains of a Conjugated D&#8211;A Polymer for Logic Control of the Semiconducting Performance by Light Irradiation</title>
      <dc:description>
Conjugated D&#8211;A polymers with two types of azo groups, for which trans&#8211;cis isomerization can sequentially occur with light irradiation at different wavelengths, in the side chains possess tri&#8208;stable semiconducting states. As a consequence, the performance of the resulting field&#8208;effect transistors can be logically controlled by light irradiation at three different wavelengths, mimicking three&#8208;value logic gates.








Abstract
A new design strategy for photoresponsive semiconducting polymer with tri&#8208;stable semiconducting states is reported by simultaneous incorporation of tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;methoxy&#8208;substituted azobenzene (mAzo) and arylazopyrazole (pAzo) in the side chains. The trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis transformations for mAzo and pAzo groups can sequentially occur within the polymer thin film after sequential 560 and 365&#160;nm light irradiation. Remarkably, the trans&#8211;cis isomerization of mAzo and pAzo groups can modulate the thin film crystallinity. Accordingly, the performances of the resulting field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) can be reversibly modulated, leading to tri&#8208;stable semiconducting states after sequential 560, 365, and 470&#160;nm light irradiation. Therefore, the device performance can be logically controlled by light irradiation at three different wavelengths. In addition, with light irradiation and device current as the input and output signals, the three&#8208;value logic gate by using single FET device can be successfully mimicked.

      <title>Shape&#8208;Memory Metallopolymers Based on Two Orthogonal Metal&#8211;Ligand Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>
The synthesis and characterization of shape&#8208;memory metallopolymers based on orthogonal supramolecular interactions are presented; i.e., two different metal complexes. By a cyclo mechanic test, the structure&#8211;property relationship is studied, and a strong correlation between the switching temperature, which ranges in this case from 85 to 115&#160;&#176;C, and the structural parameters is achieved.








Abstract
A new shape&#8208;memory polymer is presented, in which both the stable phase as well as the switching unit consist of two different metal complexes. Suitable metal ions, which simultaneously form labile complexes with histidine and stable ones with terpyridine ligands, are identified via isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements. Different copolymers are synthesized, which contain butyl methacrylate as the main monomer and the metal&#8208;binding ligands in the side chains. Zn(TFMS)2 and NiCl2 are utilized for the dual crosslinking, resulting in the formation of metallopolymer networks. The switching temperature can simply be tuned by changing the composition as well as by the choice of the metal ion. Strain fixity rates (about 99%) and very high strain recovery rates (up to 95%) are achieved and the mechanism is revealed using different techniques such as Raman spectroscopy.

      <title>Liquid Crystal Elastomer&#8208;Based Magnetic Composite Films for Reconfigurable Shape&#8208;Morphing Soft Miniature Machines</title>
      <dc:description>
A liquid crystal elastomer material with embedded ferromagnetic microparticles takes advantage of both magnetic and thermal stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. Such monolithic soft material enables reconfigurable magnetic soft miniature machines that self&#8208;adapt to changing environmental conditions. The hybrid material introduces a multi&#8208;modal actuation and physical intelligence capability for wireless soft machines.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive and active materials promise radical advances for many applications. In particular, soft magnetic materials offer precise, fast, and wireless actuation together with versatile functionality, while liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are capable of large reversible and programmable shape&#8208;morphing with high work densities in response to various environmental stimuli, e.g., temperature, light, and chemical solutions. Integrating the orthogonal stimuli&#8208;responsiveness of these two kinds of active materials could potentially enable new functionalities and future applications. Here, magnetic microparticles (MMPs) are embedded into an LCE film to take the respective advantages of both materials without compromising their independent stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. This composite material enables reconfigurable magnetic soft miniature machines that can self&#8208;adapt to a changing environment. In particular, a miniature soft robot that can autonomously alter its locomotion mode when it moves from air to hot liquid, a vine&#8208;like filament that can sense and twine around a support, and a light&#8208;switchable magnetic spring are demonstrated. The integration of LCEs and MMPs into monolithic structures introduces a new dimension in the design of soft machines and thus greatly enhances their use in applications in complex environments, especially for miniature soft robots, which are self&#8208;adaptable to environmental changes while being remotely controllable.

      <title>A Patternable and In Situ Formed Polymeric Zinc Blanket for a Reversible Zinc Anode in a Skin&#8208;Mountable Microbattery</title>
      <dc:description>
A zinc blanket created by the coordination between carbonyl oxygen atoms in a polyimide coating and zinc ions overcomes the thermodynamic instability and facilitates plating/stripping kinetics. Patterning this zinc blanket for a Zn microanode allows for the development of a skin&#8208;mountable microbattery with an outstanding rate capability and stable cycling performance, providing promise for microbatteries integrable for electronic skin.








Abstract
Owing to their high safety and reversibility, aqueous microbatteries using zinc anodes and an acid electrolyte have emerged as promising candidates for wearable electronics. However, a critical limitation that prevents implementing zinc chemistry at the microscale lies in its spontaneous corrosion in an acidic electrolyte that causes a capacity loss of 40% after a ten&#8208;hour rest. Widespread anti&#8208;corrosion techniques, such as polymer coating, often retard the kinetics of zinc plating/stripping and lack spatial control at the microscale. Here, a polyimide coating that resolves this dilemma is reported. The coating prevents corrosion and hence reduces the capacity loss of a standby microbattery to 10%. The coordination of carbonyl oxygen in the polyimide with zinc ions builds up over cycling, creating a zinc blanket that minimizes the concentration gradient through the electrode/electrolyte interface and thus allows for fast kinetics and low plating/stripping overpotential. The polyimide's patternable feature energizes microbatteries in both aqueous and hydrogel electrolytes, delivering a supercapacitor&#8208;level rate performance and 400 stable cycles in the hydrogel electrolyte. Moreover, the microbattery is able to be attached to human skin and offers strong resistance to deformations, splashing, and external shock. The skin&#8208;mountable microbattery demonstrates an excellent combination of anti&#8208;corrosion, reversibility, and durability in wearables.

      <dc:description>
A self&#8208;regulated conjugation strategy is proposed to engineer viologen for flow batteries. In the oxidized state, the conjugation is &#8220;off&#8221; and the two pyridinium rings behave independently, yielding concomitant transfer of two electrons and one voltage plateau. In the reduced state, the conjugation is &#8220;on&#8221; and the charge can be effectively delocalized, lowering the Lewis basicity and improving the cycling stability of the battery.

A rotating phenyl ring is introduced between the two pyridinium rings, namely, 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bis[3&#8208;(trimethylamonium)propyl]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;(1,4&#8208;phenylene)bispyridinium tetrachloride ((APBPy)Cl4), to form a switchable conjugation. In this design, the conjugation is switched &#8220;off&#8221; in the oxidized state and the two pyridinium rings behave independently during the redox process, yielding a concomitant transfer of two electrons at the same potential and, thus, simplifying the battery management. The conjugation is switched &#8220;on&#8221; in the reduced state and the charge can be effectively delocalized, lowering the Lewis basicity and improving its chemical stability. By pairing 0.50 m (APBPy)Cl4 with a 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl oxyl derivative as the positive electrolyte, a flow battery delivers a high standard cell voltage of 1.730&#160;V and a high specific capacity of 20.0 Ah L&#8211;1. The battery also shows an exceptionally high energy efficiency of 80.8% and a superior cycling stability at 80&#160;mA cm&#8211;2. This strategy proves itself a great success in engineering viologen as a two&#8208;electron storage mediator with high capacity and stability.

&lt;p&gt;A self&#8208;regulated conjugation strategy is proposed to engineer viologen for flow batteries. In the oxidized state, the conjugation is &#8220;off&#8221; and the two pyridinium rings behave independently, yielding concomitant transfer of two electrons and one voltage plateau. In the reduced state, the conjugation is &#8220;on&#8221; and the charge can be effectively delocalized, lowering the Lewis basicity and improving the cycling stability of the battery.

      <title>Surface Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Fluorescence for Detecting Sub&#8208;Millimeter&#8208;Sized Tumors</title>
      <dc:description>
A surface plasmon&#8208;enhanced short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) fluorescent probe with high brightness is developed. Both the actively and passively targeted imaging probes can locate tumors in vivo with similar intratumor distributions in an SKOV&#8208;3 ovarian cancer model. In addition, these SWIR imaging probes are able to detect sub&#8208;millimeter&#8208;sized tumor nodules, making them excellent candidates for fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided surgery.








Abstract
Short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR, 900&#8211;1700&#160;nm) enables in vivo imaging with high spatiotemporal resolution and penetration depth due to the reduced tissue autofluorescence and decreased photon scattering at long wavelengths. Although small organic SWIR dye molecules have excellent biocompatibility, they have been rarely exploited as compared to their inorganic counterparts, mainly due to their low quantum yield. To increase their brightness, in this work, the SWIR dye molecules are placed in close proximity to gold nanorods (AuNRs) for surface plasmon&#8208;enhanced emission. The fluorescence enhancement is optimized by controlling the dye&#8208;to&#8208;AuNR number ratio and up to &#8776;45&#8208;fold enhancement factor is achieved. In addition, the results indicate that the highest dye&#8208;to&#8208;AuNR number ratio gives the highest emission intensity per weight and this is used for synthesizing SWIR imaging probes using layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) technique with polymer coating protection. Then, the SWIR imaging probes are applied for in vivo imaging of ovarian cancer and the surface coating effect on intratumor distribution of the imaging probes is investigated in two orthotopic ovarian cancer models. Lastly, it is demonstrated that the plasmon&#8208;enhanced SWIR imaging probe has great potential for fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided surgery by showing its capability to detect sub&#8208;millimeter&#8208;sized tumors.

      <title>Hidden Vacancy Benefit in Monolayer 2D Semiconductors</title>
      <dc:description>
An unusual benefit of vacancies in monolayer 2D semiconductors is enhancing their charge transport properties of a nearest&#8208;neighbor hopping conduction mechanism, to push the performance limit of atomically thin transistors with record&#8208;setting performance metrics.








Abstract
Monolayer 2D semiconductors (e.g., MoS2) are of considerable interest for atomically thin transistors but generally limited by insufficient carrier mobility or driving current. Minimizing the lattice defects in 2D semiconductors represents a common strategy to improve their electronic properties, but has met with limited success to date. Herein, a hidden benefit of the atomic vacancies in monolayer 2D semiconductors to push their performance limit is reported. By purposely tailoring the sulfur vacancies (SVs) to an optimum density of 4.7% in monolayer MoS2, an unusual mobility enhancement is obtained and a record&#8208;high carrier mobility (&gt;115 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) is achieved, realizing monolayer MoS2 transistors with an exceptional current density (&gt;0.60&#160;mA &#181;m&#8722;1) and a record&#8208;high on/off ratio &gt;1010,&#160;and enabling a logic inverter with an ultrahigh voltage gain &gt;100.&#160;The systematic transport studies reveal that the counterintuitive vacancy&#8208;enhanced transport originates from a nearest&#8208;neighbor hopping conduction model, in which an optimum SV density is essential for maximizing the charge hopping probability. Lastly, the vacancy benefit into other monolayer 2D semiconductors is further generalized; thus, a general strategy for tailoring the charge transport properties of monolayer materials is defined.

      <title>Supramolecular Assembled Programmable Nanomedicine As In Situ Cancer Vaccine for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel strategy to use programmable nanomedicine for cancer immunotherapy is presented. A programmable immune activation nanomedicine (PIAN) is constructed through supramolecular modular assembly, which automatically transforms after intravenous injection and finishes sequential multiple steps for eliciting robust immune responses in vivo.








Abstract
Using nanotechnology for improving the immunotherapy efficiency represents a major research interest in recent years. However, there are paradoxes and obstacles in using a single nanoparticle to fulfill all the requirements in the complicated immune activation processes. Herein, a supramolecular assembled programmable immune activation nanomedicine (PIAN) for sequentially finishing multiple steps after intravenous injection and eliciting robust antitumor immunity in situ is reported. The programmable nanomedicine is constructed by supramolecular assembly via host&#8211;guest interactions between poly&#8208;[(N&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)&#8208;aspartamide]&#8208;Pt(IV)/&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (PPCD), CpG/polyamidoamine&#8208;thioketal&#8208;adamantane (CpG/PAMAM&#8208;TK&#8208;Ad), and methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;thioketal&#8208;adamantane (mPEG&#8208;TK&#8208;Ad). After intravenous injection and accumulation at the tumor site, the high level of reactive oxygen species in the tumor microenvironment promotes PIAN dissociation and the release of PPCD (mediating tumor cell killing and antigen release) and CpG/PAMAM (mediating antigen capturing and transferring to the tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes). This results in antigen&#8208;presenting cell activation, antigen presentation, and robust antitumor immune responses. In combination with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody, the PIAN cures 40% of mice in a colorectal cancer model. This PIAN provides a new framework for designing programmable nanomedicine as in situ cancer vaccine for cancer immunotherapy.

      <title>Two&#8208;Photon Polymerization of Nanocomposites for the Fabrication of Transparent Fused Silica Glass Microstructures</title>
      <dc:description>
High&#8208;resolution 3D printing of photocurable silica nanocomposites using two&#8208;photon direct laser writing is presented. The nanocomposites are consecutively debound and sintered to high&#8208;quality fused silica microstructures with optical surface roughness.








Abstract
Fused silica glass is the material of choice for many high&#8208;performance components in optics due to its high optical transparency combined with its high thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability. Especially, the generation of fused silica microstructures is of high interest for microoptical and biomedical applications. Direct laser writing (DLW) is a suitable technique for generating such devices, as it enables nearly arbitrary structuring down to the sub&#8208;micrometer level. In this work, true 3D structuring of transparent fused silica glass using DLW with tens of micrometer resolution and a surface roughness of Ra&#160;&#8776; 6&#160;nm is demonstrated. The process uses a two&#8208;photon curable silica nanocomposite resin that can be structured by DLW, with the printout being convertible to transparent fused silica glass via thermal debinding and sintering. This technology will enable a plethora of applications from next&#8208;generation optics and photonics to microfluidic and biomedical applications with resolutions on the scale of tens of micrometers.

Abstract
A graphitic carbon nitride/rGO/perylene diimide polymer (g&#8208;C3N4/rGO/PDIP) Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction is successfully constructed to realize high&#8208;flux charge transfer and efficient photocatalytic overall water splitting. A giant internal electric field in the Z&#8208;scheme junction is built, enabling the charge separation efficiency to be enhanced dramatically by 8.5 times. Thus, g&#8208;C3N4/rGO/PDIP presents an efficient and stable photocatalytic overall water splitting activity with H2 and O2 evolution rate of 15.80 and 7.80 &#181;mol h&#8722;1, respectively, &#8776;12.1 times higher than g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets. Meanwhile, a notable quantum efficiency of 4.94% at 420 nm and solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen energy&#8208;conversion efficiency of 0.30% are achieved, prominently surpassing many reported g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;based photocatalysts. Briefly, this work throws light on enhancing the internal electric field by interface control to dramatically improve the photocatalytic performance.

      <dc:description>
The combination of yellow&#8208;emissive CsCu2I3 and blue&#8208;emissive Cs3Cu2I5 for environmentally friendly white LEDs is demonstrated by Zhifeng Shi, Lijun Zhang, Chongxin Shan, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2001367. Both copper halides are highly stable against heat, ultraviolet light, and oxygen/moisture degradation, as is demonstrated, and they use this strategy to overcome photon self&#8208;absorption, color instability, and lead&#8208;toxicity issues, which are among the challenges faced for perovskite white LEDs.

      <dc:description>
In article number 2004732, Michael R. Bockstaller, George Fytas, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate an order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude amplification of optical absorption in low&#8208;contrast opals formed by the self&#8208;assembly of polymer&#8208;tethered nanoparticles. The amplification is shown to be caused by the &#8220;slow photons effect&#8221; and to induce rapid &#8220;melting&#8221; of the opal films even in the absence of visible absorption. This work points to novel opportunities for tailoring light&#8211;matter interactions in hybrid materials by deliberate engineering of the molecular structure of polymer chains at interfaces.

      <title>Review on Li Deposition in Working Batteries: From Nucleation to Early Growth</title>
      <dc:description>
Lithium (Li) nucleation and early growth processes significantly determine the final deposition behavior. The recent progress in influential models proposed to understand the process of Li nucleation and early growth is highlighted. Inspired by the abovementioned understanding, diverse anode&#8208;design strategies, which contribute to better batteries with superior electrochemical performance and dendrite&#8208;free deposition behavior, are also summarized.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal is one of the most promising alternative anode materials of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries demanded for advanced energy storage in the coming fourth industrial revolution. Nevertheless, disordered Li deposition easily causes short lifespan and safety concerns and thus severely hinders the practical applications of Li metal batteries. Tremendous efforts are devoted to understanding the mechanism for Li deposition, while the final deposition morphology tightly relies on the Li nucleation and early growth. Here, the recent progress in insightful and influential models proposed to understand the process of Li deposition from nucleation to early growth, including the heterogeneous model, surface diffusion model, crystallography model, space charge model, and Li&#8208;SEI model, are highlighted. Inspired by the abovementioned understanding on Li nucleation and early growth, diverse anode&#8208;design strategies, which contribute to better batteries with superior electrochemical performance and dendrite&#8208;free deposition behavior, are also summarized. This work broadens the horizon for practical Li metal batteries and also sheds light on more understanding of other important metal&#8208;based batteries involving the metal deposition process.

      <title>Self&#8208;Activatable Photo&#8208;Extracellular Vesicle for Synergistic Trimodal Anticancer Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Self&#8208;activatable photo&#8208;extracellular vesicles are constructed by loading M1 macrophage&#8208;derived EVs with bis[2,4,5&#8208;trichloro&#8208;6&#8208;(pentyloxycarbonyl)phenyl] oxalate, chlorin e6, and prodrug aldoxorubicin. This skillfully engineered extracellular vesicles can actively target tumors owing to its inherent tumor&#8208;homing ability, wherein it exhibits potent trimodal therapy effects in an intersynergistic and self&#8208;controllable way attributed to the interaction between the engineered EV and the special tumor microenvironment.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) hold great potential in both disease treatment and drug delivery. However, accurate drug release from EVs, as well as the spontaneous treatment effect cooperation of EVs and drugs at target tissues, is still challenging. Here, an engineered self&#8208;activatable photo&#8208;EV for synergistic trimodal anticancer therapy is reported. M1 macrophage&#8208;derived EVs (M1 EVs) are simultaneously loaded with bis[2,4,5&#8208;trichloro&#8208;6&#8208;(pentyloxycarbonyl) phenyl] oxalate (CPPO), chlorin e6 (Ce6), and prodrug aldoxorubicin (Dox&#8208;EMCH). After administration, the as&#8208;prepared system actively targets tumor cells because of the tumor&#8208;homing capability of M1 EVs, wherein M1 EVs repolarize M2 to M1 macrophages, which not only display immunotherapy effects but also produce H2O2. The reaction between H2O2 and CPPO generates chemical energy that activates Ce6, creating both chemiluminescence for imaging and singlet oxygen (1O2) for photodynamic therapy (PDT). Meanwhile, 1O2&#8208;induced membrane rupture leads to the release of Dox&#8208;EMCH, which is then activated and penetrates the deep hypoxic areas of tumors. The synergism of immunotherapy, PDT, and chemotherapy results in potent anticancer efficacy, showing great promise to fight cancers.

      <title>Chiral Spin Textures in Amorphous Iron&#8211;Germanium Thick Films</title>
      <dc:description>
Topological magnetic states emerge in amorphous iron&#8211;germanium with local inversion symmetry breaking. The formation of helical spins, Bloch, and anisotropic skyrmions is accompanied by a suppressed orbital moment, indicating electron orbital disorder. Temporal evolution of thermal spin fluctuations reveals a persistent switching of anisotropic skyrmions between two discrete states affirming degenerate spin chirality and particle&#8208;like properties.








Abstract
Topological solitary fields, such as magnetic and polar skyrmions, are envisioned to revolutionize microelectronics. These configurations have been stabilized in solid&#8208;state materials with a global inversion symmetry breaking, which translates in magnetic materials into a vector spin exchange known as the Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction (DMI), as well as spin chirality selection and isotropic solitons. This work reports experimental evidence of 3D chiral spin textures, such as helical spins and skyrmions with different chirality and topological charge, stabilized in amorphous Fe&#8211;Ge thick films. These results demonstrate that structurally and chemically disordered materials with a random DMI can resemble inversion symmetry broken systems with similar magnetic properties, moments, and states. Disordered systems are distinguished from systems with global inversion symmetry breaking by their degenerate spin chirality that allows for forming isotropic and anisotropic topological spin textures at remanence, while offering greater flexibility in materials synthesis, voltage, and strain&#160;manipulation.

      <title>Mirroring Action Potentials: Label&#8208;Free, Accurate, and Noninvasive Electrophysiological Recordings of Human&#8208;Derived Cardiomyocytes</title>
      <dc:description>
A new electrophysiology paradigm transduces cellular action potentials into optical signals by mirroring the cellular ionic currents into the motion of fluorophores in a separate fluid. The resulting optical signals (mirror action potentials) offer an accurate, noninvasive measurement of the cells&#8217; action potentials. This methodology, successfully tested on human&#8208;derived cardiomyocytes, is an ideal candidate for noninvasive optical drug screenings.








Abstract
The electrophysiological recording of action potentials in human cells is a long&#8208;sought objective due to its pivotal importance in many disciplines. Among the developed techniques, invasiveness remains a common issue, causing cytotoxicity or altering unpredictably cell physiological response. In this work, a new approach for recording intracellular signals of outstanding quality and with noninvasiveness is introduced. By taking profit of the concept of mirror charge in classical electrodynamics, the new proposed device transduces cell ionic currents into mirror charges in a microfluidic chamber, thus realizing a virtual mirror cell. By monitoring mirror charge dynamics, it is possible to effectively record the action potentials fired by the cells. Since there is no need for accessing or interacting with the cells, the method is intrinsically noninvasive. In addition, being based on optical recording, it shows high spatial resolution and high parallelization. As shown through a set of experiments, the presented methodology is an ideal candidate for the next generation devices for the reliable assessment of cardiotoxicity on human&#8208;derived cardiomyocytes. More generally, it paves the way toward a new family of in vitro biodevices that will lay a new milestone in the field of electrophysiology.

      <title>Digital Transformation in Materials Science: A Paradigm Change in Material's Development</title>
      <dc:description>
The ongoing expansion of digitalization approaches influences the material research significantly. The complete workflow of the development of novel materials, from synthesis, over characterization, to fabrication will change within the coming years to a more automatic, data&#8208;driven, and robot&#8208;based approach. The current status is summarized and advantages, challenges, and future perspectives discussed.








Abstract
The ongoing digitalization is rapidly changing and will further revolutionize all parts of life.

&lt;p&gt;The ongoing expansion of digitalization approaches influences the material research significantly. The complete workflow of the development of novel materials, from synthesis, over characterization, to fabrication will change within the coming years to a more automatic, data&#8208;driven, and robot&#8208;based approach. The current status is summarized and advantages, challenges, and future perspectives discussed.

&lt;p&gt;The ongoing digitalization is rapidly changing and will further revolutionize all parts of life. This statement is currently omnipresent in the media as well as in the scientific community; however, the exact consequences of the proceeding digitalization for the field of materials science in general and the way research will be performed in the future are still unclear. There are first promising examples featuring the potential to change discovery and development approaches toward new materials. Nevertheless, a wide range of open questions have to be solved in order to enable the so&#8208;called digital&#8208;supported material research.

      <title>Nanocatalytic Theranostics with Glutathione Depletion and Enhanced Reactive Oxygen Species Generation for Efficient Cancer Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
A fully biodegradable and biocompatible nanotheranostics (denoted as PGC&#8208;DOX) is constructed by an in situ biomineralization method using poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;modified glucose oxidase (GOx) as template. The integration of GOx&#8208;mediated starvation therapy, H2O2 self&#8208;supplying and glutathione&#8208;eliminating enhanced chemodynamic therapy, and DOX&#8208;induced chemotherapy, mean that the prepared PGC&#8208;DOX is effective for tumor growth inhibition with minimal side effects in vivo.








Abstract
Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) is an emerging therapy method that kills cancer cells by converting intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into highly toxic hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH). To overcome the current limitations of the insufficient endogenous H2O2 and the high concentration of glutathione (GSH) in tumor cells, an intelligent nanocatalytic theranostics (denoted as PGC&#8208;DOX) that possesses both H2O2 self&#8208;supply and GSH&#8208;elimination properties for efficient cancer therapy is presented. This nanoplatform is constructed by a facile one&#8208;step biomineralization method using poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;modified glucose oxidase (GOx) as a template to form biodegradable copper&#8208;doped calcium phosphate nanoparticles, followed by the loading of doxorubicin (DOX). As an enzyme catalyst, GOx can effectively catalyze intracellular glucose to generate H2O2, which not only starves the tumor cells, but also supplies H2O2 for subsequent Fenton&#8208;like reaction. Meanwhile, the redox reaction between the released Cu2+ ions and intracellular GSH will induce GSH depletion and reduce Cu2+ to Fenton agent Cu+ ions, and then trigger the H2O2 to generate &#8226;OH by a Cu+&#8208;mediated Fenton&#8208;like reaction, resulting in enhanced CDT efficacy. The integration of GOx&#8208;mediated starvation therapy, H2O2 self&#8208;supply and GSH&#8208;elimination enhanced CDT, and DOX&#8208;induced chemotherapy, endow the PGC&#8208;DOX with effective tumor growth inhibition with minimal side effects in vivo.

      <title>Metasurfaces: Three&#8208;Dimensional Photoengraving of Monolithic, Multifaceted Metasurfaces (Adv. Mater. 1/2021)</title>
      <dc:description>
Metasurfaces are traditionally 2D metamaterials that manipulate light. In article number 2005454, Shu Yang and co&#8208;workers bring them into 3D by photoengraving diverse metasurfaces onto different facets of monolithic, 3D microstructured arrays in a high&#8208;throughput and on demand fashion. By patterning locally confined metasurfaces on a cube, each cube becomes a multiplexing pixel for color reflection and filtering.

      <dc:description>
The coupling of quasi&#8208;2D perovskite layers is demonstrated by Kai Wang, Rui Chen, Wallace C. H. Choy, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2005570. Their results show that a bifunctional ligand can simultaneously diminish the weak van der Waals gap and passivate perovskite defects for efficient energy transfer and radiative recombination. They fabricate blue PeLEDs that show high performance with an EQE of 10.11% and a long stability of 81.3 min.

      <title>Chiral Materials: Fullerene Desymmetrization as a Means to Achieve Single&#8208;Enantiomer Electron Acceptors with Maximized Chiroptical Responsiveness (Adv. Mater. 1/2021)</title>
      <dc:description>
Solubilized fullerene derivatives have revolutionized the development of organic photovoltaic devices, but the isomeric complexity that arises from addition of the solubilizing group is often ignored. In article number 2004115, Matthew J. Fuchter and co&#8208;workers separate 10 pairs of enantiomers from the 19 structural isomers of a common fullerene acceptor. They demonstrate the potential to discriminate circularly polarized light with a fast light&#8208;response time and with a very high photocurrent dissymmetry factor, enabled by a chiral fullerene.

Abstract
Nano polymorphism (NPM), as an emerging research area in the field of energy storage, and rechargeable batteries, have attracted much attention recently. In this review, the recent progress on the composition and formation of polymorphs, and the evolution processes of different redox electrodes in rechargeable metal&#8208;ion, metal&#8211;air, and metal&#8211;sulfur batteries are highlighted. First, NPM and its significance for rechargeable batteries are discussed. Subsequently, the current NPM modulation strategies of different types of representative electrodes for their corresponding rechargeable battery applications are summarized. The goal is to demonstrate how NPM could tune the intrinsic material properties, and hence, improve their electrochemical activities for each battery type. It is expected that the analysis of polymorphism and electrochemical properties of materials could help identify some &#8220;processing&#8211;structure&#8211;properties&#8221; relationships for material design and performance enhancement. Lastly, the current research challenges and potential research directions are discussed to offer guidance and perspectives for future research on NPM engineering.

      <title>Self&#8208;Amplifying Nanotherapeutic Drugs Homing to Tumors in a Manner of Chain Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel tumor&#8208;targeting nanodrug with self&#8208;amplifying effects based on chain reaction mechanism is developed. The nanodrug can activate more drug&#8208;accessible targets for effectively homing itself to tumor in large amount. In addition, it can be used as a nanocarrier to selectively deliver other drugs to tumors. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated its high tumor&#8208;targeting ability and antitumor effect.








Abstract
Active tumor&#8208;targeting drug delivery has great potency in cancer therapy. However, the targeting efficiency of traditional active tumor&#8208;targeting nanotherapeutic drugs is limited by the scarcity of their accessible targets/receptors in tumors. Here, a novel self&#8208;amplifying tumor&#8208;targeting strategy with a chain reaction mechanism is developed. A coagulation targeting peptide (GNQEQVSPLTLLKXC, termed A15)&#8208;decorated poly(L&#8208;glutamic acid)&#8208;graft&#8208;maleimide poly(ethylene glycol)/combretastatin A4 conjugate (A15&#8208;PLG&#8208;CA4) is prepared to obtain a self&#8208;amplifying nanotherapeutic platform homing to tumors. After administration to tumor&#8208;bearing mice, A15&#8208;PLG&#8208;CA4 starts a chain reaction cycle consisting of intratumoral hemorrhage, target FXIIIa amplification, blood clot binding, and CA4 release in tumors. In this way, A15&#8208;PLG&#8208;CA4 increases the level of its accessible targets (FXIIIa) in a manner of chain reaction. The FXIIIa activity at 8&#160;h is 4.1&#8208;fold more than the one at 0&#160;h in the C26 tumors treated with A15&#8208;PLG&#8208;CA4. The total CA4 concentration at 24&#160;h is 2.9&#8208;fold more than the control. A15&#8208;PLG&#8208;CA4 shows a significantly higher antitumor effect against large C26 tumors (&#8776;500&#160;mm3) thanks to the remarkable tumor&#8208;targeting ability compared with the control. Therefore, this report highlights the potential of the self&#8208;amplifying tumor&#8208;targeting strategy in the development of next generation active tumor&#8208;targeting nanotherapeutic drugs for tumor therapy.

      <title>Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper&#8208;Phase Hybrid Halide Perovskite/Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Blend Memory Transistors</title>
      <dc:description>
Blending the organic semiconductor 2,7&#8208;dioctyl[1]benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b]benzothiophene (C8&#8208;BTBT) with the layered Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper&#8208;phase perovskite (PEA)2PbBr4 in solution phase facilitates the formation of large and near&#8208;single&#8208;crystalline&#8208;quality platelet&#8208;like perovskite domains overlaid by a thin layer of the organic molecule. Transistors utilizing the (PEA)2PbBr4/C8&#8208;BTBT bilayer as the channel exhibit unexpectedly large hysteresis, and their use as non&#8208;volatile memory element is demonstrated.








Abstract
Controlling the morphology of metal halide perovskite layers during processing is critical for the manufacturing of optoelectronics. Here, a strategy to control the microstructure of solution&#8208;processed layered Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper&#8208;phase perovskite films based on phenethylammonium lead bromide ((PEA)2PbBr4) is reported. The method relies on the addition of the organic semiconductor 2,7&#8208;dioctyl[1]benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b]benzothiophene (C8&#8208;BTBT) into the perovskite formulation, where it facilitates the formation of large, near&#8208;single&#8208;crystalline&#8208;quality platelet&#8208;like (PEA)2PbBr4 domains overlaid by a &#8776;5&#8208;nm&#8208;thin C8&#8208;BTBT layer. Transistors with (PEA)2PbBr4/C8&#8208;BTBT channels exhibit an unexpectedly large hysteresis window between forward and return bias sweeps. Material and device analysis combined with theoretical calculations suggest that the C8&#8208;BTBT&#8208;rich phase acts as the hole&#8208;transporting channel, while the quantum wells in (PEA)2PbBr4 act as the charge storage element where carriers from the channel are injected, stored, or extracted via tunneling.&#160;When tested as a non&#8208;volatile memory, the devices exhibit a record memory window (&gt;180&#160;V), a high erase/write channel current ratio (104), good data retention, and high endurance (&gt;104 cycles). The results here highlight a new memory device concept for application in large&#8208;area electronics, while the growth technique can potentially be exploited for the development of other optoelectronic devices including solar cells, photodetectors, and light&#8208;emitting diodes.

      <title>Epitaxial Growth of Single&#8208;Phase 1T'&#8208;WSe2 Monolayer with Assistance of Enhanced Interface Interaction</title>
      <dc:description>
The WSe2 monolayer in 1T&#8217; phase is a large&#8208;gap quantum spin Hall insulator, but is thermodynamically metastable. Thanks to the enhanced interface interaction, a single&#8208;phase 1T'&#8208;WSe2 monolayer is grown on SrTiO3(100) substrate using the molecular beam epitaxial method, and the interlayer in&#8208;plane strain also drives the 1T'&#8208;WSe2 into a semimetallic phase.








Abstract
The WSe2 monolayer in 1T&#8217; phase is reported to be a large&#8208;gap quantum spin Hall insulator, but is thermodynamically metastable and so far the fabricated samples have always been in the mixed phase of 1T&#8217; and 2H, which has become a bottleneck for further exploration and potential applications of the nontrivial topological properties. Based on first&#8208;principle calculations in this work, it is found that the 1T&#8217; phase could be more stable than 2H phase with enhanced interface interactions. Inspired by this discovery, SrTiO3 (100) is chosen as substrate and WSe2 monolayer is successfully grown in a 100% single 1T&#8217; phase using the molecular beam epitaxial method. Combining in situ scanning tunneling microscopy and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements, it is found that the in&#8208;plane compressive strain in the interface drives the 1T'&#8208;WSe2 into a semimetallic phase. Besides providing a new material platform for topological states, the results show that the interface interaction is a new approach to control both the structure phase stability and the topological band structures of transition metal dichalcogenides.

      <title>Perovskite Quantum Wells Formation Mechanism for Stable Efficient Perovskite Photovoltaics&#8212;A Real&#8208;Time Phase&#8208;Transition Study</title>
      <dc:description>
The time&#8208;resolved grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering technique provides real&#8208;time insights on the phase&#8208;transition during the organic cation coating and perovskite quantum wells (PQWs)/3D architecture formation mechanism. With fluorinated poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) as a dopant&#8208;free hole&#8208;transport layer, this PQWs/3D architecture leads to stable perovskite photovoltaics with power conversion efficiency of &gt;22%.








Abstract
The combination of a bulk 3D perovskite layer and a reduced dimensional perovskite layer (perovskite quantum wells (PQWs)) is demonstrated to enhance the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) significantly in terms of stability and efficiency. This perovskite hierarchy has attracted intensive research interest; however, the in&#8208;depth formation mechanism of perovskite quantum wells on top of a 3D perovskite layer is not clearly understood and is therefore the focus of this study. Along with ex situ morphology and photophysical characterization, the time&#8208;resolved grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (TS&#8208;GIWAXS) technique performed in this study provides real&#8208;time insights on the phase&#8208;transition during the organic cation (HTAB ligand molecule) coating and PQWs/3D architecture formation process. A strikingly strong ionic reaction between the 3D perovskite and the long&#8208;chain organic cation leads to the quick formation of an ordered intermediate phase within only a few seconds. The optimal PQWs/3D&#160;architecture is achieved by controlling the HTAB casting, which is assisted by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight SIMS characterization. By controlling the second ionic reaction during the long&#8208;chain cation coating process, along with the fluorinated&#160;poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) as a hole&#8208;transport layer, the perovskite solar cells demonstrate efficiencies exceeding 22% along with drastically improved device stability.

      <title>Strategy of Enhancing the Volumetric Energy Density for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
The volumetric energy density (WV) of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries is critical for mobile applications. This review analyzes key factors that dominate WV, summarizes progress on WV research, and discusses technologies for tuning cathode structure. A &#8220;Three High One Low (THOL)&#8221; strategy is proposed for high WV and gravimetric energy density (WG), and catalytic hosts are important to unlock the sulfur electroactivity.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries hold the promise of the next generation energy storage system beyond state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Despite the attractive gravimetric energy density (WG), the volumetric energy density (WV) still remains a great challenge for the practical application, based on the primary requirement of Small and Light for Li&#8211;S batteries. This review highlights the importance of cathode density, sulfur content, electroactivity in achieving high energy densities. In the first part, key factors are analyzed in a model on negative/positive ratio, cathode design, and electrolyte/sulfur ratio, orientated toward energy densities of 700&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8722;1/500&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1. Subsequently, recent progresses on enhancing WV for coin/pouch cells are reviewed primarily on cathode. Especially, the &#8220;Three High One Low&#8221; (THOL) (high sulfur fraction, high sulfur loading, high density host, and low electrolyte quantity) is proposed as a feasible strategy for achieving high WV, taking high WG into consideration simultaneously. Meanwhile, host materials with desired catalytic activity should be paid more attention for fabricating high performance cathode. In the last part, key engineering technologies on manipulating the cathode porosity/density are discussed, including calendering and dry electrode coating. Finally, a future outlook is provided for enhancing both WV and WG of the Li&#8211;S batteries.

      <title>A Library of Atomically Thin 2D Materials Featuring the Conductive&#8208;Point Resistive Switching Phenomenon</title>
      <dc:description>
The library of atomically thin 2D materials featuring non&#8208;volatile resistive switching can provide a promising and broad platform for exploring the sub&#8208;nanometer scaling limit, which is beneficial for emerging device concepts. A dissociation&#8211;diffusion&#8211;adsorption (DDA) model is proposed to describe the common conductive&#8208;point mechanism behind 2D&#8208;materials&#8208;based universal resistive switching and supported by systematic density functional theory (DFT) calculations showing favorable adsorption of metal into native defects.








Abstract
Non&#8208;volatile resistive switching (NVRS) is a widely available effect in transitional metal oxides, colloquially known as memristors, and of broad interest for memory technology and neuromorphic computing. Until recently, NVRS was not known in other transitional metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), an important material class owing to their atomic thinness enabling the ultimate dimensional scaling. Here, various monolayer or few&#8208;layer 2D&#160;materials are presented in the conventional vertical structure that exhibit NVRS, including TMDs (MX2, M = transitional metal, e.g., Mo, W, Re, Sn, or Pt; X = chalcogen, e.g., S, Se, or Te), TMD heterostructure (WS2/MoS2), and an atomically thin insulator (h&#8208;BN). These results indicate the universality of the phenomenon in 2D non&#8208;conductive materials, and feature low switching voltage, large ON/OFF ratio, and forming&#8208;free characteristic. A&#160;dissociation&#8211;diffusion&#8211;adsorption model is proposed, attributing the enhanced conductance to metal atoms/ions adsorption into intrinsic vacancies, a conductive&#8208;point mechanism supported by first&#8208;principle calculations and scanning tunneling microscopy characterizations. The results motivate further research in the understanding and applications of defects in 2D materials.

      <title>Tunable Photocontrolled Motions of Anil&#8208;Poly(ethylene terephthalate) Systems through Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer and Trans&#8211;Cis Isomerization</title>
      <dc:description>
Multiple photoresponsive motions, excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer, and trans&#8211;cis isomerization, are combined into anil&#8208;poly(ethylene terephthalate) systems to achieve photocontrolled function with the aid of a stretching process. The relationship between molecular structure and photodeformation property is investigated, to provide efficient strategies of molecular design for the further development of photoresponsive materials.








Abstract
With the combination of excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer and trans&#8211;cis isomerization as microscopic molecular motions under light stimulus, multiple photodeformable processes are achieved in anil&#8208;poly(ethylene terephthalate) systems, including simple bending, dancing butterflies, and switches. The doping films can realize light&#8208;driven contraction as large as 70% and bending angle of about 141&#176;, upon a simple stretching process. The internal mechanism is confirmed by transient absorption spectra, and the relationship between molecular structure and photocontrolled motion is investigated by theoretical calculations and crystal analysis. This work provides a convenient approach by utilizing anils to fabricate reversible actuations with desirable geometries, greatly contributing to the applications and manufacturing of soft robots and related research.

&lt;p&gt;Multiple photoresponsive motions, excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer, and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; isomerization, are combined into anil&#8208;poly(ethylene terephthalate) systems to achieve photocontrolled function with the aid of a stretching process. The relationship between molecular structure and photodeformation property is investigated, to provide efficient strategies of molecular design for the further development of photoresponsive materials.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the combination of excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; isomerization as microscopic molecular motions under light stimulus, multiple photodeformable processes are achieved in anil&#8208;poly(ethylene terephthalate) systems, including simple bending, dancing butterflies, and switches. The doping films can realize light&#8208;driven contraction as large as 70% and bending angle of about 141&#176;, upon a simple stretching process. The internal mechanism is confirmed by transient absorption spectra, and the relationship between molecular structure and photocontrolled motion is investigated by theoretical calculations and crystal analysis. This work provides a convenient approach by utilizing anils to fabricate reversible actuations with desirable geometries, greatly contributing to the applications and manufacturing of soft robots and related research.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nanoassemblies with Effective Serum Tolerance Capability Achieving Robust Gene Silencing Efficacy for Breast Cancer Gene Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
A new strategy of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) modification is proposed for constructing cationic polymers&#8208;based siRNA vectors with enhanced serum resistance. This PEG modification strategy does not consume free aminos of cationic polymers. The constructed siRNA vectors show robust gene silencing efficacy in the absence and presence of serum. In vivo, these vectors exhibit excellent antitumor effects and good biocompatibility.








Abstract
The transfection efficiency of siRNA mediated by cationic polymers is limited due to the instability of polymers/siRNA complexes in the presence of serum. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is usually applied to modify cationic polymers, so as to reduce protein and cell adsorption and then to improve siRNA transfection efficiency. However, the polymers&#8217; modification with PEG mostly consumes the free amino of the polymers, which can, in turn, reduce the charge density and limit their siRNA transfection efficacy. Here, a new PEG modification strategy that need not consume the surface aminos of polymers is proposed. Catechol&#8211;PEG polymers are coated on the surface of phenylboronic acid (PBA)&#8208;modified Generation 5 (G5) poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (G5PBA) via reversible boronate esters to establish PEG&#8208;modified dendrimer/siRNA nanoassemblies for efficient siRNA delivery. The PEG/G5PBA/siRNA nanoassemblies have positive charge and show excellent gene silencing efficacy in the absence of serum in vitro. More importantly, the PEG/G5PBA/siRNA nanoassemblies also exhibit excellent serum resistance and gene silencing efficacy in serum&#8208;containing medium. Furthermore, the effective antiserum and gene silencing efficacy elicited by these nanoassemblies lead to excellent antitumor effects in vivo. This proposed strategy constitutes an important approach to reach an excellent gene silencing efficacy in the presence of serum.

      <title>Light&#8208;Activated Stress Relaxation, Toughness Improvement, and Photoinduced Reversal of Physical Aging in Glassy Polymer Networks</title>
      <dc:description>
Reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) moieties are introduced into glassy copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) networks to promote spatiotemporally controlled dynamic bond exchange in the glassy state. As a result, unprecedented levels of stress relaxation, extended plastic deformation post yielding, and intriguing rejuvenation of mechanical properties in physically aged samples are achieved by activation of RAFT in the glassy state.








Abstract
A covalent adaptable network (CAN) with high glass transition temperature (Tg), superior mechanical properties including toughness and ductility, and unprecedented spatio&#8208;temporally controlled dynamic behavior is prepared by introducing dynamic moieties capable of reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) into photoinitiated copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC)&#8208;based networks. While the CuAAC polymerization yields glassy polymers composed of rigid triazole linkages with enhanced toughness, the RAFT moieties undergo bond exchange leading to stress relaxation upon light exposure. This unprecedented level of stress relaxation in the glassy state leads to numerous desirable attributes including glassy state photoinduced plasticity, toughness improvement during large deformation, and even photoinduced reversal of the effects of physical aging resulting in the rejuvenation of mechanical and thermodynamic properties in physically aged RAFT&#8208;CuAAC networks that undergo bond exchange in the glassy state. Surprisingly, when an allyl&#8208;sulfide&#8208;containing azide monomer (AS&#8208;N3) is used to form the network, the network exhibits up to 80% stress relaxation in the glassy state (Tg&#160;&#8722; 45 &#176;C) under fixed displacement. In situ activation of RAFT during mechanical loading results in a 50% improvement in elongation to break and 40% improvement in the toughness when compared to the same network without light&#8208;activation of RAFT during the tensile testing.

      <title>A Monochloro Copper Phthalocyanine Memristor with High&#8208;Temperature Resilience for Electronic Synapse Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
An organic memristor using small&#8208;molecule monochloro copper phthalocyanine as the active material is developed. The unencapsulated memristive devices exhibit high thermal resilience at 300 &#176;C, good flexibility, and high capability of simulating a variety of functions of biological synapses. This work offers an effective approach toward the implementation of brain&#8211;computer interface technology for high&#8208;temperature applications.








Abstract
Memristors are considered to be one of the most promising device concepts for neuromorphic computing, in particular thanks to their highly tunable resistive states. To realize neuromorphic computing architectures, the assembly of large memristive crossbar arrays is necessary, but is often accompanied by severe heat dispassion. Organic materials can be tailored with on&#8208;demand electronic properties in the context of neuromorphic applications. However, such materials are more susceptible to heat, and detrimental effects such as thermally induced degradation directly lead to failure of device operation. Here, an organic memristive synapse formed of monochloro copper phthalocyanine, which remains operational and capable of memristive switching at temperatures as high as 300 &#176;C in ambient air without any encapsulation, is demonstrated. The change in the electrical conductance is found to be a result of ion movement, closely resembling what takes place in biological neurons. Furthermore, the high viability of this approach is showcased by demonstrating flexible memristors with stable switching behaviors after repeated mechanical bending as well as organic synapses capable of emulating a trainable and reconfigurable memristor array for image information processing. The results set a precedent for thermally resilient organic synapses to impact organic neuromorphic devices in progressing their practicality.

      <title>Magnetoelectric Tuning of Pinning&#8208;Type Permanent Magnets through Atomic&#8208;Scale Engineering of Grain Boundaries</title>
      <dc:description>
Through injection of hydrogen atoms into grain boundaries, the coercivity of a Sm2Co17&#8208;based magnet is tuned by &#8776;1.3 T by applying &#8776;1 V. This work not only offers an effective route to achieve giant magneto&#8208;electric effects in metallic ferromagnets, but also unveils the neglected critical role of grain boundaries in determining the coercivity of pinning&#8208;type magnets.








Abstract
Pinning&#8208;type magnets with high coercivity at high temperatures are at the core of thriving clean&#8208;energy technologies. Among these, Sm2Co17&#8208;based magnets are excellent candidates owing to their high&#8208;temperature stability. However, despite intensive efforts to optimize the intragranular microstructure, the coercivity currently only reaches 20&#8211;30% of the theoretical limits. Here, the roles of the grain&#8208;interior nanostructure and the grain boundaries in controlling coercivity are disentangled by an emerging magnetoelectric approach. Through hydrogen charging/discharging by applying voltages of only &#8776;1&#160;V, the coercivity is reversibly tuned by an unprecedented value of &#8776;1.3 T. In situ magneto&#8208;structural characterization and atomic&#8208;scale tracking of hydrogen atoms reveal that the segregation of hydrogen atoms at the grain boundaries, rather than the change of the crystal structure, dominates the reversible and substantial change of coercivity. Hydrogen reduces the local magnetocrystalline anisotropy and facilitates the magnetization reversal starting from the grain boundaries. This study opens a way to achieve the giant magnetoelectric effect in permanent magnets by engineering grain boundaries with hydrogen atoms. Furthermore, it reveals the so far neglected critical role of grain boundaries in the conventional magnetization&#8208;switching paradigm of pinning&#8208;type magnets, suggesting a critical reconsideration of engineering strategies to overcome the coercivity limits.

      <title>Ultrasonic Interfacial Engineering of Red Phosphorous&#8211;Metal for Eradicating MRSA Infection Effectively</title>
      <dc:description>
A controllable sonothermal ability can be realized through interfacial engineering by constructing heterojunction interfaces between red phosphorous and metals (Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Co, and Ni). Ultrasound&#8208;excited electrons convert ultrasonic energy into heat through vibration, relaxation, and recombination in the heterointerface. Multidrug&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus can be eradicated efficiently by sonothermal effect and with thermally controlled release of nitric oxide gas.








Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is considered to be a potential treatment for various diseases including cancers and bacterial infections due to its deep penetration ability and biosafety, but its SDT efficiency is limited by the hypoxia environment of deep tissues. This study proposes creating a potential solution, sonothermal therapy, by developing the ultrasonic interfacial engineering of metal&#8211;red phosphorus (RP), which has an obviously improved sonothermal ability of more than 20 &#176;C elevation under 25 min of continuous ultrasound (US) excitation as compared to metal alone. The underlying mechanism is that the mechanical energy of the US activates the motion of the interfacial electrons. US&#8208;induced electron motion in the RP can efficiently transfer the US energy into phonons in the forms of heat and lattice vibrations, resulting in a stronger US absorption of metal&#8211;RP. Unlike the nonspecific heating of the cavitation effect induced by US, titanium&#8211;RP can be heated in situ when the US penetrates through 2.5&#160;cm of pork tissue. In addition, through a sonothermal treatment in vivo, bone infection induced by multidrug&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is successfully eliminated in under 20 min of US without tissue damage. This work provides a new strategy for combating MRSA by strong sonothermal therapy through US interfacial engineering.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is considered to be a potential treatment for various diseases including cancers and bacterial infections due to its deep penetration ability and biosafety, but its SDT efficiency is limited by the hypoxia environment of deep tissues. This study proposes creating a potential solution, sonothermal therapy, by developing the ultrasonic interfacial engineering of metal&#8211;red phosphorus (RP), which has an obviously improved sonothermal ability of more than 20 &#176;C elevation under 25 min of continuous ultrasound (US) excitation as compared to metal alone. The underlying mechanism is that the mechanical energy of the US activates the motion of the interfacial electrons. US&#8208;induced electron motion in the RP can efficiently transfer the US energy into phonons in the forms of heat and lattice vibrations, resulting in a stronger US absorption of metal&#8211;RP. Unlike the nonspecific heating of the cavitation effect induced by US, titanium&#8211;RP can be heated in situ when the US penetrates through 2.5&#160;cm of pork tissue. In addition, through a sonothermal treatment in vivo, bone infection induced by multidrug&#8208;resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (MRSA) is successfully eliminated in under 20 min of US without tissue damage. This work provides a new strategy for combating MRSA by strong sonothermal therapy through US interfacial engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Deep&#8208;Blue Perovskite Single&#8208;Mode Lasing through Efficient Vapor&#8208;Assisted Chlorination</title>
      <dc:description>
Deep&#8208;blue laser sources are of interest in lithography, microscopy, and medical and scientific devices; and lasers have, until now, been limited to bulky gas laser systems and III&#8211;V semiconductor devices. A new strategy to achieve deep&#8208;blue emitting perovskite films, and the prospect of extending the range of deep&#8208;blue/near UV laser sources are reported.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites have emerged as promising candidates for solution&#8208;processed laser gain materials, with impressive performance in the green and red spectral regions. Despite exciting progress, deep&#8208;blue&#8212;an important wavelength for laser applications&#8212;remains underexplored; indeed, cavity integration and single&#8208;mode lasing from large&#8208;bandgap perovskites have yet to be achieved. Here,&#160;a vapor&#8208;assisted chlorination strategy that enables synthesis of low&#8208;dimensional CsPbCl3&#160;thin films exhibiting deep&#8208;blue emission is reported. Using this approach,&#160; high&#8208;quality perovskite thin films having a low surface roughness (RMS &#8776; 1.3&#160;nm) and efficient charge transfer properties are achieved. These enable us to document low&#8208;threshold amplified spontaneous emission. Levering the high quality of the gain medium,&#160; vertical&#8208;cavity surface&#8208;emitting lasers with a low lasing threshold of 6.5 &#181;J cm&#8722;2&#160;are fabricated. This report of deep&#8208;blue perovskite single&#8208;mode lasing showcases the prospect of increasing the range of deep&#8208;blue laser sources.

      <title>Efficient Hydrogen Evolution of Oxidized Ni&#8208;N3 Defective Sites for Alkaline Freshwater and Seawater Electrolysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Seawater electrolysis is an attractive alternative to traditional freshwater electrolysis due to the abundance of seawater. A&#160;novel Ni single&#8208;atom catalyst with oxidized Ni&#8208;N3 and Ni&#8208;N4 coordination is developed to achieve efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance in alkaline seawater electrolytes. Both experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the low&#8208;coordinated Ni&#8208;N3 facilitates water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption during HER.








Abstract
For mass production of high&#8208;purity hydrogen fuel by electrochemical water splitting, seawater electrolysis is an attractive alternative to the traditional freshwater electrolysis due to the abundance and low cost of seawater in nature. However, the undesirable chlorine ion oxidation reactions occurring simultaneously with seawater electrolysis greatly hinder the overall performance of seawater electrolysis. To tackle this problem, electrocatalysts of high activity and selectivity with purposely modulated coordination and an alkaline environment are urgently required. Herein, it is demonstrated that atomically dispersed Ni with triple nitrogen coordination (Ni&#8208;N3) can achieve efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance in alkaline media. The atomically dispersed Ni electrocatalysts exhibit overpotentials as low as 102 and 139&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8211;2 in alkaline freshwater and seawater electrolytes, respectively, which compare favorably with those previously reported. They also deliver large current densities beyond 200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8211;2 at lower overpotentials than Pt/C, as well as show negligible current attenuation over 14 h. The X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) experimental analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations verify that the Ni&#8208;N3 coordination, which exhibits a lower coordination number than Ni&#8208;N4, facilitates water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption, and hence enhances the HER activity.

      <title>Sensing of COVID&#8208;19 Antibodies in Seconds via Aerosol Jet Nanoprinted Reduced&#8208;Graphene&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Coated 3D Electrodes</title>
      <dc:description>
A ten&#8208;second COVID&#8208;19 antibody test is developed, which represents the fastest detection of this pathogenic biomarker. The test uses 3D nanoprinted electrodes coated with reduced&#8208;graphene&#8208;oxide and viral antigens. The COVID&#8208;19 sensor can be reused 9 times and is connected to a smartphone interface for a convenient readout. This sensing technology is a powerful tool that will greatly benefit public health.








Abstract
Rapid diagnosis is critical for the treatment and prevention of diseases. An advanced nanomaterial&#8208;based biosensing platform that&#160;detects COVID&#8208;19 antibodies within seconds is reported. The biosensing platform is created by 3D nanoprinting of three&#8208;dimensional electrodes, coating the electrodes by nanoflakes of&#160;reduced&#8208;graphene&#8208;oxide&#160;(rGO), and immobilizing specific viral antigens on the rGO nanoflakes. The electrode is then integrated with a microfluidic device and used in a standard electrochemical cell. When antibodies are introduced on the electrode surface, they selectively bind with the antigens, changing the impedance of the electrical circuit which is detected via impedance spectroscopy. Antibodies to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike S1 protein and its&#160;receptor&#8208;binding&#8208;domain (RBD)&#160;are detected&#160;at a limit&#8208;of&#8208;detection of 2.8&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;15 and 16.9&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;15 m,&#160;respectively,&#160;and read by a smartphone&#8208;based user interface. The sensor can be regenerated within a minute by introducing a low&#8208;pH chemistry that elutes the antibodies from the antigens, allowing successive&#160;sensing&#160;of&#160;test&#160;samples using the same sensor. Sensing of S1 and RBD antibodies is specific, which cross&#8208;reacts neither with other antibodies such as RBD, S1, and nucleocapsid antibody nor with proteins such as interleukin&#8208;6. The proposed sensing platform could also be useful to detect biomarkers for other infectious agents such as Ebola, HIV, and Zika.

      <title>Kirigami Engineering&#8212;Nanoscale Structures Exhibiting a Range of Controllable 3D Configurations</title>
      <dc:description>
This work studies the effect of the thickness of a single nanoscale 3D kirigami structure with two distinct out&#8208;of&#8208;plane tilting configurations. The findings represent a new step in the characterization of thin films experiencing buckling&#8208;induced out of plane shape transformations and provide a new degree of freedom to control 3D configurations of micro&#8208; and nanoscale buckling&#8208;induced kirigami structures.








Abstract
Kirigami structures provide a promising approach to transform flat films into 3D complex structures that are difficult to achieve by conventional fabrication approaches. By designing the cutting geometry, it is shown that distinct buckling&#8208;induced out&#8208;of&#8208;plane configurations can be obtained, separated by a sharp transition characterized by a critical geometric dimension of the structures. In situ electron microscopy experiments reveal the effect of the ratio between the in&#8208;plane cut size and film thickness on out&#8208;of&#8208;plane configurations. Moreover, geometrically nonlinear finite element analyses (FEA) accurately predict the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane modes measured experimentally, their transition as a function of cut geometry, and provide the stress&#8211;strain response of the kirigami structures. The combined computational&#8211;experimental approach and results reported here represent a step forward in the characterization of thin films experiencing buckling&#8208;induced out&#8208;of&#8208;plane shape transformations and provide a path to control 3D configurations of micro&#8208; and nanoscale buckling&#8208;induced kirigami structures. The out&#8208;of&#8208;plane configurations promise great utility in the creation of micro&#8208; and nanoscale systems that can harness such structural behavior, such as optical scanning micromirrors, novel actuators, and nanorobotics. This work is of particular significance as the kirigami dimensions approach the sub&#8208;micrometer scale which is challenging to achieve with conventional micro&#8208;electromechanical system technologies.

      <title>First Decade of Interfacial Iontronic Sensing: From Droplet Sensors to Artificial Skins</title>
      <dc:description>
Iontronic interfacial sensing is a merging field with unique advantages. The development of the iontronic interfacial sensing technology in its first decade is summarized with comprehensive discussions on theorical models, iontronic materials, and device architectures and structures, as well as novel enabling applications, aiming to provide a technical roadmap for the next wave of innovations and breakthroughs in this direction.








Abstract
Over the past decade, a brand&#8208;new pressure&#8208; and tactile&#8208;sensing modality, known as iontronic sensing has emerged, utilizing the supercapacitive nature of the electrical double layer (EDL) that occurs at the electrolytic&#8211;electronic interface, leading to ultrahigh device sensitivity, high noise immunity, high resolution, high spatial definition, optical transparency, and responses to both static and dynamic stimuli, in addition to thin and flexible device architectures. Together, it offers unique combination of enabling features to tackle the grand challenges in pressure&#8208; and tactile&#8208;sensing applications, in particular, with recent interest and rapid progress in the development of robotic intelligence, electronic skin, wearable health as well as the internet&#8208;of&#8208;things, from both academic and industrial communities. A historical perspective of the iontronic sensing discovery, an overview of the fundamental working mechanism along with its device architectures, a survey of the unique material aspects and structural designs dedicated, and finally, a discussion of the newly enabled applications, technical challenges, and future outlooks are provided for this promising sensing modality with implementations. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments of the iontronic sensing technology in its first decade are summarized, potentially providing a technical roadmap for the next wave of innovations and breakthroughs in this field.

      <title>Quantum Rescaling, Domain Metastability, and Hybrid Domain&#8208;Walls in 2D CrI3 Magnets</title>
      <dc:description>
Higher&#8208;order exchange and quantum effects are widely known to play an important role in nanomagnets. However, it is unclear whether they are important in recently discovered 2D magnets. It is shown that biquadratic exchange interactions and quantum&#8208;rescaling corrections are the keys on the long&#8208;range ordering of 2D CrI3 layers. Metastability induces domain walls of hybrid types with different chirality.








Abstract
Higher&#8208;order exchange interactions and quantum effects are widely known to play an important role in describing the properties of low&#8208;dimensional magnetic compounds. Here, the recently discovered 2D van der Waals (vdW) CrI3 is identified as a quantum non&#8208;Heisenberg material with properties far beyond an Ising magnet as initially assumed. It is found that biquadratic exchange interactions are essential to quantitatively describe the magnetism of CrI3 but quantum rescaling corrections are required to reproduce its thermal properties. The quantum nature of the heat bath represented by discrete electron&#8211;spin and phonon&#8211;spin scattering processes induces the formation of spin fluctuations in the low&#8208;temperature regime. These fluctuations induce the formation of metastable magnetic domains evolving into a single macroscopic magnetization or even a monodomain over surface areas of a few micrometers. Such domains display hybrid characteristics of N&#233;el and Bloch types with a narrow domain wall width in the range of 3&#8211;5 nm. Similar behavior is expected for the majority of 2D vdW magnets where higher&#8208;order exchange interactions are appreciable.

      <title>Failing Forward: Stability of Transparent Electrodes Based on Metal Nanowire Networks</title>
      <dc:description>
Metal nanowire (MNW)&#8208;based transparent electrode technology is a promising low&#8208;cost alternative to indium tin oxide, offering mechanical flexibility and low materials cost. The fundamental failure mechanisms of MNWs, strategies to computationally model MNW networks, characterization strategies, and encapsulation strategies are discussed. Lastly, a perspective on evaluating MNW&#8208;based electrodes based on their technological relevance and cost is presented.








Abstract
Metal nanowire (MNW)&#8208;based transparent electrode technologies have significantly matured over the last decade to become a prominent low&#8208;cost alternative to indium tin oxide (ITO). Beyond reaching the same level of performance as ITO, MNW networks offer additional advantages including flexibility and low materials cost. To facilitate adoption of MNW networks as a replacement to ITO, they must overcome their inherent stability issues while maintaining their properties and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Herein, the fundamental failure mechanisms of MNW networks are discussed in detail. Recent strategies to computationally model MNWs from the nano&#8208; to macroscale and suggest future work to capture dynamic failure to unravel mechanisms that account for convolution of the failure modes are highlighted. Strategies to characterize MNW network failure in situ and postmortem are also discussed. In addition, recent work about improving the stability of MNW networks via encapsulation is discussed. Lastly, a perspective is given on how to frame the requirements of MNW&#8208;encapsulant hybrids with reference to their target applications, namely: solar cells, transparent film heaters, sensors, and displays. A cost analysis to comment on the feasibility of implementing MNW hybrids is provided, and critical areas to focus on for future work on MNW networks are suggested.

Abstract
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have been a hot research topic due to their facile synthesis, excellent optical and optoelectronic properties, and record&#8208;breaking efficiency of corresponding optoelectronic devices. Nowadays, the development of miniaturized high&#8208;performance photodetectors (PDs) has been fueling the demand for novel photoactive materials, among which low&#8208;dimensional MHPs have attracted burgeoning research interest. In this report, the synthesis, properties, photodetection performance, and stability of low&#8208;dimensional MHPs, including 0D, 1D, 2D layered and nonlayered nanostructures, as well as their heterostructures are reviewed. Recent advances in the synthesis approaches of low&#8208;dimensional MHPs are summarized and the key concepts for understanding the optical and optoelectronic properties related to the PD applications of low&#8208;dimensional MHPs are introduced. More importantly, recent progress in novel PDs based on low&#8208;dimensional MHPs is presented, and strategies for improving the performance and stability of perovskite PDs are highlighted.

      <title>Progress and Roadmap for Intelligent Self&#8208;Healing Materials in Autonomous Robotics</title>
      <dc:description>
Self&#8208;healing materials are exciting avenues toward sustainable and intelligent long lifespan robots. The history and recent advances in material strategies for self&#8208;healing in robotics and stretchable electronics toward future development of the fully autonomous self&#8208;healing robots are reviewed.








Abstract
Robots are increasingly assisting humans in performing various tasks. Like special agents with elite skills, they can venture to distant locations and adverse environments, such as the deep sea and outer space. Micro/nanobots can also act as intrabody agents for healthcare applications. Self&#8208;healing materials that can autonomously perform repair functions are useful to address the unpredictability of the environment and the increasing drive toward the autonomous operation. Having self&#8208;healable robotic materials can potentially reduce costs, electronic wastes, and improve a robot endowed with such materials longevity. This review aims to serve as a roadmap driven by past advances and inspire future cross&#8208;disciplinary research in robotic materials and electronics. By first charting the history of self&#8208;healing materials, new avenues are provided to classify the various self&#8208;healing materials proposed over several decades. The materials and strategies for self&#8208;healing in robotics and stretchable electronics are also reviewed and discussed. It is believed that this article encourages further innovation in this exciting and emerging branch in robotics interfacing with material science and electronics.

A general and facile self&#8208;assembly strategy for fabricating high&#8208;performance films with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), based on nacre&#8208;mimetic nanocomposite design is proposed. The laminated nanoclay endows the films with tunable oxygen permeability, and programmable retention times of RTP signals can be achieved. Applications including oxygen sensors and photolithographic RTP tags, and a new anti&#8208;interception concept are demonstrated.








Abstract
A generic, facile, and waterborne strategy is introduced to fabricate flexible, low&#8208;cost nanocomposite films with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) by incorporating waterborne RTP polymers into self&#8208;assembled bioinspired polymer/nanoclay nanocomposites. The excellent oxygen barrier of the lamellar nanoclay structure suppresses the quenching effect from ambient oxygen (kq) and broadens the choice of polymer matrices towards lower glass transition temperature (Tg), while providing better mechanical properties and processability. Moreover, the oxygen permeation and diffusion inside the films can be fine&#8208;tuned by varying the polymer/nanoclay ratio, enabling programmable retention times of the RTP signals, which is exploited for transient information storage and anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials. Additionally, anti&#8208;interception materials are showcased by tracing the interception&#8208;induced oxygen history that interferes with the preset self&#8208;erasing time. Merging bioinspired nanocomposite design with RTP materials contributes to overcoming the inherent limitations of molecular design of organic RTP compounds, and allows programmable temporal features to be added into RTP materials by controlled mesostructures. This will assist in paving the way for practical applications of RTP materials as novel anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials.
