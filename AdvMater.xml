         <title>Hardware and Information Security Primitives Based on 2D Materials and Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A review of hardware security solutions using novel electronics, optical, and material properties of 2D materials and their corresponding heterostructure device configurations for Internet of Things platforms. The five quintessential security domains for discussion are physically unclonable functions, true random number generators, logic locking, hardware watermarking and anticounterfeiting, and hardware camouflaging.








Abstract
Hardware security is a major concern for the entire semiconductor ecosystem that accounts for billions of dollars in annual losses. Similarly, information security is a critical need for the rapidly proliferating edge devices that continuously collect and communicate a massive volume of data. While silicon&#8208;based complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor technology offers security solutions, these are largely inadequate, inefficient, and often inconclusive, as well as resource intensive in time, energy, and cost, leading to tremendous room for innovation in this field. Furthermore, silicon&#8208;based security primitives have shown vulnerability to machine learning (ML) attacks. In recent years, 2D materials such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides have been intensely explored to mitigate these security challenges. In this review, 2D&#8208;materials&#8208;based hardware security solutions such as camouflaging, true random number generation, watermarking, anticounterfeiting, physically unclonable functions, and logic locking of integrated circuits (ICs) are summarized with accompanying discussion on their reliability and resilience to ML attacks. In addition, the role of native defects in 2D materials in developing high entropy hardware security primitives is also examined. Finally, the existing challenges for 2D materials, which must be overcome for large&#8208;scale deployment of 2D ICs to meet the security needs of the semiconductor industry, are discussed.

         <title>MOF&#8208;Based Chemiresistive Gas Sensors: Toward New Functionalities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are being designed with more sophisticated and tailored strategies by the development of computer sciences, and the unlimited versatility of MOFs provides potential to be used in gas sensors as sensing materials, heterostructures, and templates. These MOF&#8208;based gas sensors will increase the diversity of gas&#8208;sensing libraries, and are expected to achieve novel functionalities.








Abstract
The sensing performances of gas sensors must be improved and diversified to enhance quality of life by ensuring health, safety, and convenience. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), which exhibit an extremely high surface area, abundant porosity, and unique surface chemistry, provide a promising framework for facilitating gas&#8208;sensor innovations. Enhanced understanding of conduction mechanisms of MOFs has facilitated their use as gas&#8208;sensing materials, and various types of MOFs have been developed by examining the compositional and morphological dependences and implementing catalyst incorporation and light activation. Owing to their inherent separation and absorption properties and catalytic activity, MOFs are applied as molecular sieves, absorptive filtering layers, and heterogeneous catalysts. In addition, oxide&#8208; or carbon&#8208;based sensing materials with complex structures or catalytic composites can be derived by the appropriate post&#8208;treatment of MOFs. This review discusses the effective techniques to design optimal MOFs, in terms of computational screening and synthesis methods. Moreover, the mechanisms through which the distinctive functionalities of MOFs as sensing materials, heterostructures, and derivatives can be incorporated in gas&#8208;sensor applications are presented.

         <title>Funnel Devices Based on Asymmetrically Strained Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Funnel devices are developed using WS2 and MoS2 transferred onto a fork&#8208;shaped SU&#8208;8 microstructure. Atomic force microscope, Raman, and photoluminescence measurements indicate that asymmetric strains are introduced to the transferred transition metal dichalcogenides. The scanning photocurrent mapping images acquired from various funnel devices follow a fork&#8208;shaped pattern, demonstrating that funneled excitons can be converted to electrical currents.








Abstract
The strain applied to transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) reduces their energy bandgap, and local strains result in a funnel&#8208;like band structure in which funneled excitons move toward the most strained region. Herein, a funnel device based on asymmetrically strained WS2 and MoS2 is reported. Asymmetric strains are induced by transferring the TMD flakes onto a fork&#8208;shaped SU&#8208;8 microstructure. Raman and photoluminescence spectra peaks are shifted according to the morphology of the SU&#8208;8 microstructure, indicating the application of asymmetric strains to the TMDs. To investigate whether funneled excitons can be converted to electrical currents, various devices are constructed by depositing symmetric and asymmetric electrodes onto the strained TMDs. The scanning photocurrent mapping images follow a fork&#8208;shaped pattern, indicating probable conversion of the funneled excitons into electrical currents. In the case of the funnel devices with asymmetric Au and Al electrodes, short&#8208;circuit current (ISC) of WS2 is enhanced by the strains, whereas ISC of MoS2 is suppressed because the Schottky barrier lowers with increasing strain for the MoS2. These results demonstrate that the funnel devices can be implemented using asymmetrically strained TMDs and the effect of strains on the Schottky barrier is dependent on the TMD used.

         <title>A Room&#8208;Temperature Spin&#8208;Valve with van der Waals Ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2/Graphene Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The room&#8208;temperature operation of spin&#8208;valve devices using the van der Waals itinerant ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 in heterostructures with graphene is demonstrated. Lateral spin&#8208;valve, Hanle spin precession measurements, and theoretical calculations provide unique insights by probing the Fe5GeTe2/graphene interface spintronic properties via spin&#8208;dynamics measurements, revealing multidirectional spin polarization.








Abstract
The discovery of van der Waals (vdW) magnets opened a new paradigm for condensed matter physics and spintronic technologies. However, the operations of active spintronic devices with vdW ferromagnets are limited to cryogenic temperatures, inhibiting their broader practical applications. Here, the robust room&#8208;temperature operation of lateral spin&#8208;valve devices using the vdW itinerant ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 in heterostructures with graphene is demonstrated. The room&#8208;temperature spintronic properties of Fe5GeTe2 are measured at the interface with graphene with a negative spin polarization. Lateral spin&#8208;valve and spin&#8208;precession measurements provide unique insights by probing the Fe5GeTe2/graphene interface spintronic properties via spin&#8208;dynamics measurements, revealing multidirectional spin polarization. Density functional theory calculations in conjunction with Monte Carlo simulations reveal significantly canted Fe magnetic moments in Fe5GeTe2 along with the presence of negative spin polarization at the Fe5GeTe2/graphene interface. These findings open opportunities for vdW interface design and applications of vdW&#8208;magnet&#8208;based spintronic devices at ambient temperatures.

         <title>Even&#8211;Odd&#8208;Layer&#8208;Dependent Ferromagnetism in 2D Non&#8208;van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals CrCuSe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals 2D CuCrSe2 nanosheets with thickness down to monolayer are produced using a redox&#8208;controlled exfoliation route. Differing from its bulk form with antiferromagnetic order, the CuCrSe2 nanosheets exhibit intriguing even&#8211;odd&#8208;layer&#8208;dependent magnetism evolution, which can be attributed to the orbital shift of Cr layers due to Cu&#8208;induced centrosymmetry breaking.








Abstract
Van der Waals (vdW) layered materials with strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy have attracted significant interest as the long&#8208;range magnetic order in these systems can survive even when their thicknesses is reduced to the 2D limit. Even though the interlayer coupling between the neighboring magnetic layers is very weak, it has a determining effect on the magnetism of these atomic&#8208;thickness materials. Herein, a new 2D ferromagnetic material, namely, non&#8208;vdW CuCrSe2 nanosheets with even&#8211;odd&#8208;layer&#8208;dependent ferromagnetism when laminated from an antiferromagnetic bulk is reported. Monolayer and even&#8208;layer CuCrSe2 exhibit the anomalous Hall effect and a significantly enhanced magnetic ordering temperature of more than 125 K. In contrast, the linear Hall effect exists in the odd&#8208;layer samples. Theoretical calculations indicate that the layer&#8208;dependent magnetic coupling is attributable to the orbital shift of the Cr atoms in the CrSe2 layers owing to the Cu&#8208;induced breaking of the centrosymmetry. Thus, this work sheds light on the exotic magnetic properties of layered materials that exhibit phenomena beyond weak interlayer interactions.

     alt="Even&#8211;Odd-Layer-Dependent Ferromagnetism in 2D Non-van-der-Waals CrCuSe2"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-van-der-Waals 2D CuCrSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets with thickness down to monolayer are produced using a redox-controlled exfoliation route. Differing from its bulk form with antiferromagnetic order, the CuCrSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets exhibit intriguing even&#8211;odd-layer-dependent magnetism evolution, which can be attributed to the orbital shift of Cr layers due to Cu-induced centrosymmetry breaking.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van der Waals (vdW) layered materials with strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy have attracted significant interest as the long-range magnetic order in these systems can survive even when their thicknesses is reduced to the 2D limit. Even though the interlayer coupling between the neighboring magnetic layers is very weak, it has a determining effect on the magnetism of these atomic-thickness materials. Herein, a new 2D ferromagnetic material, namely, non-vdW CuCrSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets with even&#8211;odd-layer-dependent ferromagnetism when laminated from an antiferromagnetic bulk is reported. Monolayer and even-layer CuCrSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibit the anomalous Hall effect and a significantly enhanced magnetic ordering temperature of more than 125 K. In contrast, the linear Hall effect exists in the odd-layer samples. Theoretical calculations indicate that the layer-dependent magnetic coupling is attributable to the orbital shift of the Cr atoms in the CrSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layers owing to the Cu-induced breaking of the centrosymmetry. Thus, this work sheds light on the exotic magnetic properties of layered materials that exhibit phenomena beyond weak interlayer interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Graphene&#8208;Like Conjugated Molecule as Hole&#8208;Selective Contact for Operationally Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Further enhancing the operational lifetime of the inverted&#8208;structure perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is crucial for their commercialization, and the design of hole&#8208;selective contacts at the illumination side has played a key role on operational stability. In this work, we develop the self&#8208;anchoring benzo[rst]pentaphene (SA&#8208;BPP) as a new type of hole&#8208;selective contact toward long&#8208;term operationally stable inverted PSCs. The SA&#8208;BPP molecule with a graphene&#8208;like conjugated structure shows a higher photostability and mobility than that of the frequently&#8208;used triphenylamine and carbazole&#8208;based hole&#8208;selective molecules. Besides, the anchoring groups of SA&#8208;BPP promote the formation of a large&#8208;scale uniform hole contact on ITO substrate and efficiently passivate the perovskite absorbers. Benefiting from these merits, the champion efficiencies of 22.03% for the small&#8208;sized cells and 17.08% for 5&#160;cm &#215; 5&#160;cm solar modules on an aperture area of 22.4 cm2 are achieved based on this SA&#8208;BPP contact. Also, the SA&#8208;BPP&#8208;based device exhibits a promising operational stability, with an efficiency retention of 87.4% after 2,000&#8208;hour continuous operation at the maximum power point under simulated 1&#8208;sun illumination, which indicates an estimated T80 lifetime of 3,175 hours. This novel design concept of hole&#8208;selective contacts provides a potential strategy for further improving the PSC stability.

         <title>Liquid Metal Droplets&#8208;based Elastomers from Electric Toothbrush&#8208;inspired Revolving Microfluidics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Liquid metal (LM)&#8208;based elastomers have a demonstrated value in flexible electronics. Attempts in this area include the development of multifunctional LM&#8208;based elastomers with controllable morphology, superior mechanical performances, and great stability. Herein, inspired by the working principle of electric toothbrushes, we present a revolving microfluidic system for the generation of LM droplets and construction of desired elastomers. The system involves revolving modules assembled by a needles array and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) microfluidic channels. LM droplets can be generated with controllable size in a high&#8208;throughput manner due to the revolving motion&#8208;derived drag force. We have demonstrated that by employing a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) matrix as the collection phase, the generated LM droplets can act as conductive fillers for the construction of flexible electronics directly. The resultant LM droplets&#8208;based elastomers exhibit high mechanical strength, stable electrical performance, as well as superior self&#8208;healing property benefiting from the dynamic exchangeable urea bond of the polymer matrix. Notably, due to the flexible programmable feature of the LM droplets embedded within the elastomers, various patterned LM droplets&#8208;based elastomers can be easily achieved. These results indicate that the proposed microfluidic LM droplets&#8208;based elastomers have a great potential for promoting the development of flexible electronics.

         <title>Harnessing Nanomaterials for Cancer Sonodynamic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Immunotherapy has made remarkable strides in cancer therapy over the past decade. However, such emerging therapy still suffers from the low response rates and immune&#8208;related adverse events. Various strategies have been developed to overcome these serious challenges. Thereinto, sonodynamic therapy (SDT), as a non&#8208;invasive treatment, has received ever&#8208;increasing attention especially in the treatment of deep&#8208;seated tumors. Significantly, SDT can effectively induce immunogenic cell death to trigger systemic anti&#8208;tumor immune response, termed sonodynamic immunotherapy. The rapid development of nanotechnology has revolutionized SDT effects with robust immune response induction. As a result, more and more innovative nanosonosensitizers and synergistic treatment modalities were established with superior efficacy and safe profile. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in cancer sonodynamic immunotherapy with a particular emphasis on how nanotechnology can be explored to harness SDT for amplifying anti&#8208;tumor immune response. Moreover, the current challenges in this field and the prospects for its clinical translation are also presented. We anticipate that this review can provide rational guidance and facilitate the development of nanomaterials&#8208;assisted sonodynamic immunotherapy, helping to pave the way for next&#8208;generation cancer therapy and eventually achieve a durable response in patients.

         <title>Oxyanion Engineering Suppressed Iron Segregation in Nickel&#8208;Iron Catalysts Toward Stable Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nickel&#8208;iron catalysts represent an appealing platform for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media because of their high adjustability in component and activity. However, their long&#8208;term stabilities under high current density still remain unsatisfactory due to undesirable Fe segregation. Herein, we developed a nitrate ion (NO3&#8722;) tailored strategy to mitigate Fe segregation, and thereby improve the OER stability of nickel&#8208;iron catalyst. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations indicate that introducing Ni3(NO3)2(OH)4 with stable NO3&#8722; in the lattice is conducive to constructing the stable interface of FeOOH/Ni3(NO3)2(OH)4 via the strong interaction between Fe and incorporated NO3&#8722;. Time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry and wavelet transformation analysis demonstrate that the NO3&#8722; tailored nickel&#8208;iron catalyst greatly alleviates Fe segregation, exhibiting a considerably enhanced long&#8208;term stability with a six&#8208;fold improvement over FeOOH/Ni(OH)2 without NO3&#8722; modification. Our work represents a momentous step toward regulating Fe segregation for stabilizing the catalytic performances of nickel&#8208;iron catalysts.

         <title>Flexible Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Device for Emerging Multifunctional and Smart Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs), owing to their exceptional performances in device efficiency, color purity/tunability in the visible region, and solution&#8208;processing ability on various substrates, become a potential candidate for flexible and ultrathin electroluminescent (EL) lighting and display. Moreover, beyond the lighting and display, flexible QLEDs are enabled with endless possibilities in the era of the internet of things and artificial intelligence by acting as input/output ports in wearable integrated systems. Challenges remain in the development of flexible QLEDs with the goals for high performance, excellent flexibility/even stretchability, and emerging applications. In this paper, we review the recent developments of QLEDs including quantum dot materials, working mechanism, flexible/stretchable strategies, and patterning strategies, and highlight its emerging multifunctional integrations and smart applications covering wearable optical medical devices, pressure&#8208;sensing EL devices, and neural smart EL devices. We also summarize the remaining challenges and make an outlook on the future development of flexible QLEDs. The review is expected to offer a systematic understanding and valuable inspiration for flexible QLEDs to simultaneously satisfy optoelectronic and flexible properties for emerging applications.

         <title>Gadolinium (III)&#8208;Chelated Deformable Mesoporous Organosilica Nanoparticles as Magnetic Resonance Imaging Contrast Agent</title>

Abstract
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents, such as Gd&#8208;DTPA (Magnevist), have been routinely used for detecting tumors at an early stage. However, the rapid clearance by the kidney of Gd&#8208;DTPA leads to short blood circulation time, which limits further improvement of the contrast between tumorous and normal tissue. Inspired by the deformability of red blood cells, which improves their blood circulation, we fabricated a novel MRI contrast agent by incorporating Gd&#8208;DTPA into deformable mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles (D&#8208;MON). In vivo distribution showed that the novel contrast agent was able to depress rapid clearance by the liver and spleen, and the mean residence time was 20 hours longer than Gd&#8208;DTPA. Tumor MRI showed that the D&#8208;MON&#8208;based contrast agent was highly enriched in the tumor tissue and achieved prolonged high&#8208;contrast imaging. D&#8208;MON significantly improved the performance of clinical contrast agent Gd&#8208;DTPA, exhibiting good potential in clinical applications.

         <title>Bioinspired Liquid Crystalline Spinning Enables Scalable Fabrication of High&#8208;Performing Fibrous Artificial Muscles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired spinning technology is reported that allows for continuous, high&#8208;speed production of thin and aligned liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) microfibers combined with rapid deformation, powerful actuation, high response frequency, and long cycle life. This processing technology capable of scalable production of high&#8208;performing fibrous LCEs would benefit the development of smart fabrics, intelligent wearable devices, humanoid robotics, and other areas.








Abstract
Leveraging liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) to realize scalable fabrication of high&#8208;performing fibrous artificial muscles is of particular interest because these active soft materials can provide large, reversible, programmable deformations upon environmental stimuli. High&#8208;performing fibrous LCEs require the used processing technology to enable shaping LCEs into micro&#8208;scale fine fibers as thin as possible while achieving macroscopic LC orientation, which however remains a daunting challenge. Here, a bioinspired spinning technology is reported that allows for continuous, high&#8208;speed production (fabrication speed up to 8400&#160;m&#160;h&#8722;1) of thin and aligned LCE microfibers combined with rapid deformation (actuation strain rate up to 810% s&#8722;1), powerful actuation (actuation stress up to 5.3&#160;MPa), high response frequency (50&#160;Hz), and long cycle life (250&#8201;000 cycles without obvious fatigue). Inspired by liquid crystalline spinning of spiders that takes advantage of multiple drawdowns to thin and align their dragline silks, internal drawdown via tapered&#8208;wall&#8208;induced&#8208;shearing and external drawdown via mechanical stretching are employed to shape LCEs into long, thin, aligned microfibers with the desirable actuation performances, which few processing technologies can achieve. This bioinspired processing technology capable of scalable production of high&#8208;performing fibrous LCEs would benefit the development of smart fabrics, intelligent wearable devices, humanoid robotics, and other areas.

         <title>Arrested Phase Separation Enables High&#8208;Performance Keratoprostheses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrothermally treating a dense and transparent hydrophobic association hydrogel can confer synergetic optimization among multiple performance indexes essential for keratoprostheses, where the morphology is kinetically arrested via glass transition under isochoric conditions. Such a process can mediate porous structure at &#8776;100 nm, rendering a combination of multiple desired properties that equal or surpass those of current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art keratoprostheses.








Abstract
Corneal transplantation is impeded by donor shortages, immune rejection, and ethical reservations. Pre&#8208;made cornea prostheses (keratoprostheses) offer a proven option to alleviate these issues. Ideal keratoprostheses must possess optical clarity and mechanical robustness, but also high permeability, processability, and recyclability. Here, it is shown that rationally controlling the extent of arrested phase separation can lead to optimized multiscale structure that reconciles permeability and transparency, a previously conflicting goal by common pore&#8208;forming strategies. The process is simply accomplished by hydrothermally treating a dense and transparent hydrophobic association hydrogel. The examination of multiscale structure evolution during hydrothermal treatment reveals that the phase separation with upper miscibility gap evolves to confer time&#8208;dependent pore growth due to slow dynamics of polymer&#8208;rich phase which is close to vitrification. Such a process can render a combination of multiple desired properties that equal or surpass those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art keratoprostheses. In vivo tests confirm that the keratoprosthesis can effectively repair corneal perforation and restore a transparent cornea with treatment outcomes akin to that of allo&#8208;keratoplasty. The keratoprosthesis is&#160;easy to access and convenient to carry, and thus would be an effective temporary substitute for a corneal allograft in emergency conditions.

         <title>Regenerative Living 4D Printing via Reversible Growth of Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work is inspired by an &#8220;immortal&#8221; jellyfish, Turritopsis nutricula. A mature T. nutricula has the ability to rejuvenate under unusual circumstances. A regenerative living 4D printable material system is designed. After printing, the printed seed with complex geometries can not only grow by absorbing external monomers (nutrients), but also degrow to its original seed state.








Abstract
Living creatures possess complex geometries, exceptional adaptability, and continuous growing and regenerating characteristics, which are difficult for synthetic materials to imitate simultaneously. A living polymer network with these features is reported. The polymer can be digitally printed into arbitrary 3D shapes and subsequently undergoes growth via living polymerization of a monomer as the nutrient. This leads to macroscopic dimensional growth and transforms the printed amorphous network into a crystallizable network, resulting in geometric adaptability via a shape&#8208;memory mechanism. By controlling the localized growth, an initial homogeneous structure can be converted into a geometrically different heterogeneous structure composed of materials with different properties (crystallization and mechanical properties). After growth, the original network can be chemically regenerated for regrowth. With this regenerative living 4D printing, one 3D&#8208;printed seed template can be turned into different derivatives with distinct geometries and mechanical properties when repeated regeneration is conducted in different localized regions and the degree of regrowth is varied.

         <title>Building K&#8211;C Anode with Ultrahigh Self&#8208;Diffusion Coefficient for Solid State Potassium Metal Batteries Operating at &#8722;20 to 120&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin K&#8211;10% reduced graphene oxide anode is constructed, delivering promoted K diffusion kinetics and mechanical/thermal stability at 200&#160;&#176;C, which creates an interfacial resistance (&#8776;1.3 &#937; cm2) with a current density of 2.8&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 25&#160;&#176;C and an areal capacity of 11.86 mAh cm&#8722;2, enabling solid state potassium metal batteries operating at &#8722;20 to 120&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Solid state potassium (K) metal batteries are intriguing in grid&#8208;scale energy storage, benefiting from the low cost, safety, and high energy density. However, their practical applications are impeded by poor K/solid electrolyte (SE) interfacial contact and limited capacity caused by the low K self&#8208;diffusion coefficient, dendrite growth, and intrinsically low melting point/soft features of metallic K. Herein, a fused&#8208;modeling strategy using potassiophilic carbon allotropes molted with K is demonstrated that can enhance the electrochemical performance/stability of the system via promoting K diffusion kinetics (2.37 &#215; 10&#8722;8 cm2 s&#8722;1), creating a low interfacial resistance (&#8776;1.3 &#937; cm2), suppressing dendrite growth, and maintaining mechanical/thermal stability at 200&#160;&#176;C. A homogeneous/stable K stripping/plating is consequently implemented with a high current density of 2.8&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 (at 25&#160;&#176;C) and a record&#8208;high areal capacity of 11.86 mAh cm&#8722;2 (at 0.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). The enhanced K diffusion kinetics contribute to sustaining intimate interfacial contact, stabilizing the stripping/plating at high current densities. Full cells coupling ultrathin K&#8211;C composite anodes (&#8776;50&#160;&#181;m) with Prussian blue cathodes and &#946;/&#946;&#8243;&#8208;Al2O3 SEs deliver a high energy density of 389&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 with a retention of 94.4% after 150 cycles and fantastic performances at &#8722;20 to 120&#160;&#176;C.

A homogeneous/stable K stripping/plating is consequently implemented with a high current density of 2.8&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (at 25&#160;&#176;C) and a record-high areal capacity of 11.86 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (at 0.2&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The enhanced K diffusion kinetics contribute to sustaining intimate interfacial contact, stabilizing the stripping/plating at high current densities. Full cells coupling ultrathin K&#8211;C composite anodes (&#8776;50&#160;&#181;m) with Prussian blue cathodes and &#946;/&#946;&#8243;-Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; SEs deliver a high energy density of 389&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a retention of 94.4% after 150 cycles and fantastic performances at &#8722;20 to 120&#160;&#176;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Compressible Polymer Composites with Enhanced Dielectric Temperature Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By constructing a microscale interconnected ferroelectric scaffold with a dielectric transition layer, relative dielectric constant close to the parallel model, as well as excellent mechanical compliance, are realized in polymer composites. An artificially designed composite ceramic scaffold with a compositional gradient enables the composite display high dielectric temperature stability within wide temperature ranges, offering a new approach for designing high&#8208;performance flexible dielectrics.








Abstract
High&#8208;dielectric&#8208;constant polymer composites have broad application prospects in flexible electronics and electrostatic energy storage capacitors. Substantial enhancement in dielectric constants (&#949;r) of polymer composites so far can only be obtained at a high loading of nanofillers, resulting in high dielectric loss and high elastic modulus of polymer composites. Addressing the polarization shielding and the consequent polarization discontinuity at polymer/filler interfaces has been a long&#8208;standing challenge to achieve flexible polymer composite with high &#949;r. Herein, a polymer composite with interconnected BaTiO3 (BT) ceramic scaffold is proposed and demonstrated, which exhibits a high &#949;r of &#8776;210 at a low BT volume fraction of &#8776;18&#160;vol%, approaching the upper limit predicted by the parallel model. By incorporating relaxor Ba(ZrxTi1&#8722;x)O3 phase in BT scaffold, dielectric temperature stability is further achieved with &#916;&#949;r below &#177;10% within a broad temperature range (25&#8211;140&#160;&#176;C). Moreover, the dielectric performances remain stable under a compressive strain of up to 80%. This work provides a facile approach to construct large&#8208;scale polymer composites with robust dielectric performance against changes in thermal and mechanical conditions, which are promising for high&#8208;temperature applications in flexible electronics.

         <title>Origin of the Anomalous Electrical Transport Behavior in Fe&#8208;Intercalated Weyl Semimetal Td&#8208;MoTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;intercalated Td&#8208;FexMoTe2 single crystals (0 &#8804; x &#8804; 0.15) are grown successfully. The Fe intercalation significantly tunes the structural instability and brings about exotic electronic properties for the Weyl semimetal MoTe2, including the first observed Kondo effect and spin&#8208;glass transition in its topologically nontrivial Td phase at low temperature.








Abstract
Weyl semimetal Td&#8208;MoTe2 has recently attracted much attention due to its intriguing electronic properties and potential applications in spintronics. Here, Fe&#8208;intercalated Td&#8208;FexMoTe2 single crystals (0 &lt; x&#160;&lt; 0.15 ) are grown successfully. The electrical and thermoelectric transport results consistently demonstrate that the phase transition temperature TS is gradually suppressed with increasing x. Theoretical calculation suggests that the increased energy of the Td phase, enhanced transition barrier, and more occupied bands in 1T&#8242; phase is responsible for the suppression in TS. In addition, a &#961;&#945;&#8211;lnT behavior induced by Kondo effect is observed with x &#8805; 0.08, due to the coupling between conduction carriers and the local magnetic moments of intercalated Fe atoms. For Td&#8208;Fe0.15MoTe2, a spin&#8208;glass transition occurs at &#8776;10 K. The calculated band structure of Td&#8208;Fe0.25MoTe2 shows that two flat bands exist near the Fermi level, which are mainly contributed by the dyz and dx2&#8722;y2${{\rm{d}}_{{x^2} - {y^2}}}$ orbitals of the Fe atoms. Finally, the electronic phase diagram of Td&#8208;FexMoTe2 is established for the first time. This work provides a new route to control the structural instability and explore exotic electronic states for transition&#8208;metal&#160;dichalcogenides.

         <title>Heteroepitaxial Control of Fermi Liquid, Hund Metal, and Mott Insulator Phases in Single&#8208;Atomic&#8208;Layer Ruthenates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interface control of electronic structure in single&#8208;atomic&#8208;layer ruthenates is demonstrated. Combining thin film epitaxy and photoemission spectroscopy, a method to study interfacial electronic phases of ultrathin heterostructures is developed. Fermi liquid, Hund metal, and Mott insulator phases of SrRuO3 are discovered, exclusively in the single&#8208;atomic&#8208;layer limit. This work suggests a general way to investigate ultrathin interfacial electronic systems.








Abstract
Interfaces between dissimilar correlated oxides can offer devices with versatile functionalities, and great efforts have been made to manipulate interfacial electronic phases. However, realizing such phases is often hampered by the inability to directly access the electronic structure information; most correlated interfacial phenomena appear within a few atomic layers from the interface. Here, atomic&#8208;scale epitaxy and photoemission spectroscopy are utilized to realize the interface control of correlated electronic phases in atomic&#8208;scale ruthenate&#8211;titanate heterostructures. While bulk SrRuO3 is a ferromagnetic metal, the heterointerfaces exclusively generate three distinct correlated phases in the single&#8208;atomic&#8208;layer limit. The theoretical analysis reveals that atomic&#8208;scale structural proximity effects yield Fermi liquid, Hund metal, and Mott insulator phases in the quantum&#8208;confined SrRuO3. These results highlight the extensive interfacial tunability of electronic phases, hitherto hidden in the atomically thin correlated heterostructure. Moreover, this experimental platform suggests a way to control interfacial electronic phases of various correlated materials.

A multifunctional therapeutic immune&#8208;nanomedicine, MOF&#8208;CpG&#8208;DMXAA, effectively delivers cytosine&#8211;phosphate&#8211;guanine oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODNs) and 5,6&#8208;dimethylxanthenone&#8208;4&#8208;acetic acid (DMXAA) to improve the miserable immune response by reprogramming tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs), promoting dendritic cells&#160;(DCs) maturation and inhibiting angiogenesis, achieving synergistically immunotherapy. MOF&#8208;CpG&#8208;DMXAA significantly enhances stimulator of interferon genes (STING) activation, reverses the immunosuppression state and stimulates robust tumoricidal immunity, exhibiting a synergistic efficiency to eradicate hepatocellular carcinoma.








Abstract
Immunotherapy has achieved revolutionary success in clinics, but it remains challenging for treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) characterized by high vascularization. Here, it is reported that metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;801 (MOF&#8208;801) can be employed as a stimulator of interferon genes (STING) through Toll&#8208;like receptor 4 (TLR4) not just as a drug delivery carrier. Notably, cytosine&#8211;phosphate&#8211;guanine oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODNs) and 5, 6&#8208;dimethylxanthenone&#8208;4&#8208;acetic acid (DMXAA) STING agonist with vascular disrupting function coordinates with MOF&#8208;801 to self&#8208;assemble into a nanoparticle (MOF&#8208;CpG&#8208;DMXAA) that effectively delivers CpG ODNs and DMXAA to cells for synergistically improving the tumor microenvironment by reprogramming tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs), promoting dendritic cells (DCs) maturation, as well as destroying tumor blood vessels. In HCC&#8208;bearing mouse models, it is demonstrated that MOF&#8208;CpG&#8208;DMXAA triggers systemic immune activation and stimulates robust tumoricidal immunity, resulting in a superior immunotherapeutic efficiency in orthotopic and recurrent HCC.

Here, it is reported that metal&#8211;organic framework-801 (MOF-801) can be employed as a stimulator of interferon genes (STING) through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) not just as a drug delivery carrier. Notably, cytosine&#8211;phosphate&#8211;guanine oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODNs) and 5, 6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA) STING agonist with vascular disrupting function coordinates with MOF-801 to self-assemble into a nanoparticle (MOF-CpG-DMXAA) that effectively delivers CpG ODNs and DMXAA to cells for synergistically improving the tumor microenvironment by reprogramming tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), promoting dendritic cells (DCs) maturation, as well as destroying tumor blood vessels. In HCC-bearing mouse models, it is demonstrated that MOF-CpG-DMXAA triggers systemic immune activation and stimulates robust tumoricidal immunity, resulting in a superior immunotherapeutic efficiency in orthotopic and recurrent HCC.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ionic covalent organic framework with moderate&#8208;length spacer exhibits the highest through&#8208;plane proton conductivity attributed to the synergistic contribution from the spacers and the &#8211;SO3H groups.








Abstract
Side&#8208;chain engineering of covalent organic frameworks as advanced ion conductors is a critical issue to be explored. Herein, ionic covalent organic framework membranes (iCOFMs) with spacer&#8208;engineered ionic channel are de novo designed and prepared. The ionic channels are decorated with side chains comprising spacers having different carbon chain lengths and the &#8211;SO3H groups at the end. Attributed to the synergistic contribution from the spacers and the &#8211;SO3H groups, the iCOFM with moderate&#8208;length spacer exhibit the highest through&#8208;plane proton conductivity of 889 mS cm&#8208;1 at 90&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Synergetic Lithium and Hydrogen Bonds Endow Liquid&#8208;free Photonic Ionic Elastomer with Mechanical Robustness and Electrical/optical Dual&#8208;output</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Photonic ionic elastomers (PIEs) capable of multiple signal outputs is intriguing in flexible interactive electronics. However, fabricating PIEs with simultaneous mechanical robustness, good ionic conductivity and brilliant structure color still remains challenging. Here, we break the limitations through introducing synergistic effect of lithium and hydrogen bonds into an elastomer. In virtue of lithium bonding between lithium ions and carbonyl groups in the polymer matrix as well as hydrogen bonding between silanol on the surface of silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) and ether groups along polymer chains, the PIEs demonstrate mechanical strength up to 4.3&#160;MPa and toughness up to 8.6&#160;MJ m&#8722;3. Meanwhile, the synchronous electrical and optical output under mechanical strains could be achieved in the PIEs with the presence of dissociated ions contributed by lithium bond and non&#8208;close&#8208;packed SiNPs stabilized by hydrogen bond. Moreover, due to their liquid&#8208;free nature, the PIEs exhibit extraordinary stability and durability, which could withstand extreme conditions including both high and low temperatures as well as high humidity. This work provides a promising molecular engineering route to construct high performance photonic ionic conductors towards advanced ionotronic applications.

         <title>Intrinsic Dipole Arrangement to Coordinate Energy Levels for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Despite great progress in perovskite photovoltaics, it should be noted that the intrinsic disorder dipolar cations in organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites exert negative effects on the energy band structure as well as the carrier separation and transfer dynamics. However, oriented polarization achieved by applying an external electric field may cause irreversible damage to perovskites. Herein, a unique and efficient strategy is developed to modulate the intrinsic dipole arrangement in perovskite films for high&#8208;performance and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The spontaneous reorientation of dipolar cation MA+ is triggered by a polar molecule, constructing a vertical polarization during crystallization regulation. The oriented dipole determines a gradient energy&#8208;level arrangement in PSCs and more favorable energetics at interfaces, effectively enhancing the built&#8208;in electric field and suppressing the nonradiative recombination. Besides, the dipole reorientation induces a local dielectric environment to remarkably reduce exciton binding energy, leading to an ultralong carrier diffusion length of up to 1708&#160;nm. Accordingly, the n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs achieve a significant increase in power conversion efficiency, reaching 24.63% with negligible hysteresis and exhibiting outstanding stabilities. This strategy also provides a facile route to eliminate the mismatched energetics and enhance carrier dynamics for other novel photovoltaic devices.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Induced Chirality&#8208;Selective Routing of Valley Photons via Metallic Nanostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Valleytronics in two&#8208;dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides has raised a great impact in nanophotonic information processing and transport as it provides the pseudospin degree of freedom for carrier control. The imbalance of carrier occupation in inequivalent valleys can be achieved by external stimulations such as helical light and electric field. With metasurfaces, it is feasible to separate the valley exciton in real space and momentum space, which is significant for logical nanophotonic circuits. However, the control of valley&#8208;separated far&#8208;field emission by a single nanostructure is rarely reported, despite the fact that it is crucial for subwavelength research of valley&#8208;dependent directional emission. Here, we demonstrate that the electron beam permits the chirality&#8208;selective routing of valley photons in a monolayer WS2 with Au nanostructures. The electron beam can locally excite valley excitons and regulate the coupling between excitons and nanostructures, hence controlling the interference effect of multipolar electric modes in nanostructures. Therefore, the separation degree can be modified by steering the electron beam, exhibiting the capability of subwavelength control of valley separation. Our work provides a novel method to create and resolve the variation of valley emission distribution in momentum space, paving the way for the design of future nanophotonic integrated devices.

         <title>Cartilage Lacuna&#8208;inspired Microcarriers Drive Hyaline Neocartilage Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Cartilage equivalents from hydrogels containing chondrocytes exhibit excellent potential in hyaline cartilage regeneration, yet current approaches have limited success at reconstituting the architecture to culture nondifferentiated chondrocytes in vitro. In this study, we report specially designed lacunar hyaluronic acid microcarriers (LHAMC) with mechanotransductive conditions that rapidly form stable hyaluronic acid (HA) N&#8208;hydroxy succinimide ester (NHS&#8208;ester). Specifically, carboxyl&#8208;functionalized HA is linked to collagen type I via amide&#8208;crosslinking, and gas foaming produced by ammonium bicarbonate form concave surface of the microcarriers. The temporal three&#8208;dimensional culture of chondrocytes on LHAMC uniquely remodels the extracellular matrix to induce hyaline cartilaginous microtissue regeneration and prevents an anaerobic&#8208;to&#8208;aerobic metabolism transition in response to the geometric constraints. Furthermore, by inhibiting the canonical Wnt pathway, LHAMC prevent &#946;&#8208;catenin translocation to the nucleus, repressing chondrocyte dedifferentiation. Additionally, the subcutaneous implantation model indicates that LHAMC display favorable cytocompatibility and drive robust hyaline chondrocyte&#8208;derived neocartilage formation. Our findings reveal a novel strategy for regulating chondrocyte dedifferentiation. The current study paves the way for a better understanding of geometrical insight clues into mechanotransduction interaction in regulating cell fate, opening new avenues for advancing tissue engineering.

         <title>Triclinic&#8208;Phase Bismuth Chromate: A Promising Candidate for Photocatalytic Water Splitting with Broad Spectrum Ranges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and crystal structure verification of a novel triclinic bismuth chromate, Bi2CrO6, are reported. Detailed investigations on the electronic structure and the capability of both visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven water oxidation and reduction reactions, as well as the fabrication of a Z&#8208;scheme overall water splitting system are reported, demonstrating a huge potential of the triclinic Bi2CrO6 in photocatalysis.








Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting for solar energy conversion remains challenged by the lack of novel semiconductor photocatalysts with paramount parameters including wide light&#8208;harvesting ranges and suitable band structures. Here, a novel triclinic&#8208;phase bismuth chromate (Bi2CrO6) acting as a semiconductor photocatalyst candidate is reported. Triclinic Bi2CrO6 exhibits a broad absorption range of &#8776;650&#160;nm with a direct bandgap of 1.86&#160;eV and shows a suitable band structure for water splitting. Theoretical simulations of triclinic Bi2CrO6 reveal a high charge mobility,&#160;possibly owing to the strong hybridized covalent bonds, large elastic modulus, and small carrier effective mass. The triclinic Bi2CrO6 is demonstrated to work well toward photocatalytic water oxidation and hydrogen production reactions under visible light and match well with its absorption ranges. In particular, it exhibits decent photocatalytic water oxidation performance in the presence of various electron scavengers. Furthermore, the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven Z&#8208;scheme overall water splitting system is fabricated by coupling triclinic Bi2CrO6 as the oxygen evolution photocatalyst with SrTiO3:Rh as the hydrogen evolution photocatalyst, giving a stable overall water splitting with stoichiometric evolution of H2 and O2. This work presents a promising semiconductor material enabling wide&#8208;range light harvesting for photocatalytic and photo&#8208;electrochemical solar energy conversion.

&lt;p&gt;The synthesis and crystal structure verification of a novel triclinic bismuth chromate, Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CrO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, are reported. Detailed investigations on the electronic structure and the capability of both visible-light-driven water oxidation and reduction reactions, as well as the fabrication of a Z-scheme overall water splitting system are reported, demonstrating a huge potential of the triclinic Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CrO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; in photocatalysis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photocatalytic water splitting for solar energy conversion remains challenged by the lack of novel semiconductor photocatalysts with paramount parameters including wide light-harvesting ranges and suitable band structures. Here, a novel triclinic-phase bismuth chromate (Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CrO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) acting as a semiconductor photocatalyst candidate is reported. Triclinic Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CrO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits a broad absorption range of &#8776;650&#160;nm with a direct bandgap of 1.86&#160;eV and shows a suitable band structure for water splitting.

The triclinic Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CrO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is demonstrated to work well toward photocatalytic water oxidation and hydrogen production reactions under visible light and match well with its absorption ranges.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Assisted Wet Annealing: A New Strategy for Superstrong, Tough, Stretchable, and Anti&#8208;Fatigue Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel solvent&#8208;exchange&#8208;assisted wet&#8208;annealing strategy is first proposed to develop superstrong and tough hydrogels with extremely high stretchability and excellent fatigue resistance. The hydrogels have extremely high tensile strength of 11.19 &#177; 0.27 MPa, a fracture toughness of 82.28 &#177; 2.89 MJ m&#8722;3 with stretchability up to 1879 &#177; 10%, and a fatigue threshold of &#8776;1233 J m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Hydrogels are widely used in tissue engineering, soft robots, wearable electronics, etc. However, it remains a great challenge to develop hydrogels possessing simultaneously high strength, large stretchability, great fracture energy, and good fatigue threshold to suit different applications. Herein, a novel solvent&#8208;exchange&#8208;assisted wet&#8208;annealing strategy is proposed to prepare high performance poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogels by extensively tuning the macromolecular chain movement and optimizing the polymer network. The reinforcing and toughening mechanisms are found to be &#8220;macromolecule crystallization and entanglement&#8221;. These hydrogels have large tensile strengths up to 11.19 &#177; 0.27&#160;MPa and extremely high fracture strains of 1879 &#177; 10%. In addition, the fracture energy and fatigue threshold can reach as high as 25.39 &#177; 6.64&#160;kJ m&#8722;2 and &#8776;1233 J m&#8722;2, respectively. These superb mechanical properties compare favorably to those of other tough hydrogels, organogels, and even natural tendons and synthetic rubbers. This work provides a new and effective method to fabricate superstrong, tough, stretchable, and anti&#8208;fatigue hydrogels with potential applications in artificial tendons and ligaments.

         <title>A General Strategy to Remove Metal Aggregates toward Metal&#8211;Nitrogen&#8211;Carbon Catalysts with Exclusive Atomic Dispersion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and efficient strategy is developed to obtain metal&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;doped carbons (M&#63743;N&#63743;Cs) with exclusive atomic dispersion by making use of ammonium iodide as a high&#8208;temperature etchant to remove excessive crystalline metal aggregates, which eases the identification of the genuine catalytically active sites and enables the rational design and synthesis of high&#8208;performance M&#63743;N&#63743;C catalysts.








Abstract
Metal&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;doped nanocarbons (M&#63743;N&#63743;Cs) are promising alternatives to precious metals for catalyzing electrochemical energy conversion processes. However, M&#63743;N&#63743;Cs synthesized by high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis frequently suffer from compositional heterogeneity with the simultaneous presence of atomically dispersed M&#63743;Nx sites and crystalline metal nanoparticles (NPs), which hinders the identification of active sites and rational optimization in performance. Herein, a universal and efficient strategy is reported to obtain both precious&#8208; and nonprecious&#8208;metal&#8208;based M&#63743;N&#63743;Cs (M = Pt, Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Cu, Zn) with exclusive atomic dispersion by making use of ammonium iodide as the etchant to remove excessive metal aggregates at high temperature. Taking Pt&#63743;N&#63743;C as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, the complete removal of Pt NPs in Pt&#63743;N&#63743;C enables clarification on the contributions of the atomic Pt&#63743;Nx moieties and Pt NPs to the catalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction. Combined electrochemical measurements and theoretical calculations identify that the atomic Pt&#63743;Nx moieties by themselves possess negligible activity, but they can significantly boost the activity of the Pt NPs via the synergistic effect.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Electrochemical Glycerol Conversion over a Mie Scattering Effect Enhanced Porous BiVO4 Photoanode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Mie scattering porous BiVO4 photoanode transformed from the well&#8208;documented porous BiVO4 photoanode by a facile annealing treatment in the air decreases the reflection of incident light and enables the reabsorbed ability of scattered light, leading to pronounced light&#8208;harvesting efficiency enhancement, which delivers a high dihydroxyacetone conversion rate of 325.2 mmol m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 from photo&#8208;electrochemical glycerol oxidation.








Abstract
The photo&#8208;electrochemical (PEC) oxidation of glycerol (GLY) to high&#8208;value&#8208;added dihydroxyacetone (DHA) can be achieved over a BiVO4 photoanode, while the PEC performance of most BiVO4 photoanodes is impeded due to the upper limits of the photocurrent density. Here, an enhanced Mie scattering effect of the well&#8208;documented porous BiVO4 photoanode is obtained with less effort by a simple annealing process, which significantly reduces the reflectivity to near zero. The great light absorbability increases the basic photocurrent density by 1.77 times. The selective oxidation of GLY over the BiVO4 photoanode results in a photocurrent density of 6.04 mA cm&#8722;2 and a DHA production rate of 325.2 mmol m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 that exceeds all reported values. This work addresses the poor ability of nanostructured BiVO4 to harvest light, paving the way for further improvements in charge transport and transfer to realize highly efficient PEC conversion.

         <title>Highly Reversible Lithium Metal Anode Enabled by 3D Lithiophilic&#8211;Lithiophobic Dual&#8208;Skeletons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A free&#8208;standing composite Li metal anode (Li&#8208;B@SSM) with hierarchical 3D lithiophilic&#8211;lithiophobic dual&#8208;skeletons is developed via a facile roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll mechanical pressing of stainless&#8208;steel mesh (SSM) and Li&#8208;B alloy. The coupling of micro&#8208;gridding SSM framework and LiB nanofibers enables site&#8208;selective Li stripping/plating processes, achieving excellent cycle performance and practically feasible Li metal anodes.








Abstract
Lithium metal is a promising anode for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium batteries, but its practical application is still hindered by intrinsic defects such as infinite volume expansion and uncontrollable dendrite growth. Herein, a dendrite&#8208;free 3D composite Li anode (Li&#8208;B@SSM) is prepared by mechanical rolling of lithiophilic LiB nanofibers supported by Li&#8211;B composite and lithiophobic stainless&#8208;steel mesh (SSM). Featuring hierarchical lithiophilic&#8211;lithiophobic dual&#8208;skeletons, the Li&#8208;B@SSM anode shows an ultrahigh Coulombic efficiency of 99.95% and a long lifespan of 900 h under 2 mA cm&#8722;2/1 mAh cm&#8722;2.

     alt="Highly Reversible Lithium Metal Anode Enabled by 3D Lithiophilic&#8211;Lithiophobic Dual-Skeletons"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A free-standing composite Li metal anode (Li-B@SSM) with hierarchical 3D lithiophilic&#8211;lithiophobic dual-skeletons is developed via a facile roll-to-roll mechanical pressing of stainless-steel mesh (SSM) and Li-B alloy. The coupling of micro-gridding SSM framework and LiB nanofibers enables site-selective Li stripping/plating processes, achieving excellent cycle performance and practically feasible Li metal anodes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium metal is a promising anode for high-energy-density lithium batteries, but its practical application is still hindered by intrinsic defects such as infinite volume expansion and uncontrollable dendrite growth. Herein, a dendrite-free 3D composite Li anode (Li-B@SSM) is prepared by mechanical rolling of lithiophilic LiB nanofibers supported by Li&#8211;B composite and lithiophobic stainless-steel mesh (SSM). Featuring hierarchical lithiophilic&#8211;lithiophobic dual-skeletons, the Li-B@SSM anode shows an ultrahigh Coulombic efficiency of 99.95% and a long lifespan of 900 h under 2 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;/1 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. It is demonstrated that the abnormally reversible Li stripping/plating processes should be closely related to the site-selective plating behavior and spatial confinement effect induced by the robust lithiophilic&#8211;lithiophobic dual-skeletons, which alleviates the volume changes, suppresses the growth of Li dendrites, and reduces the accumulation of &#8220;dead&#8221; Li. More importantly, the application feasibility of the Li-B@SSM anode is also confirmed in full batteries, of which the Li-B@SSM|LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; full cell shows a high capacity retention of 97.5% after 400 cycles&#160;while the Li-B@SSM|S pouch battery exhibits good cycle stability even under practically harsh conditions. This work paves the way for the facile and efficient fabrication of high-efficiency Li metal anodes toward practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Band Position&#8208;independent Piezo&#8208;electrocatalysis for Ultrahigh CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Piezo&#8208;electrocatalysis as an emerging mechano&#8208;to&#8208;chemistry energy conversion technique opens multiple innovative opportunities and draws great interest over the past decade. However, the two potential mechanisms in piezo&#8208;electrocatalysis, i.e., screening charge effect and energy band theory, generally coexist in the most piezoelectrics, making the essential mechanism remain controversial. Here, for the first time, we distinguish the two mechanisms in piezo&#8208;electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (PECRR) through a narrow&#8208;bandgap piezo&#8208;electrocatalyst strategy using MoS2 nanoflakes as demo. With conduction band of &#8208;0.12&#160;eV, the MoS2 nanoflakes are unsatisfied for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO redox potential of &#8208;0.53&#160;eV, yet they achieve an ultrahigh CO yield of &#8764; 543.1 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 in PECRR. Potential band position shifts under vibration are still unsatisfied with CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO potential verified by a combination analysis of theoretical investigation and piezo&#8208;photocatalytic experiment, further indicating that the mechanism of piezo&#8208;electrocatalysis is independent of band position. Besides, MoS2 nanoflakes exhibit unexpected intense &#8220;breathing&#8221; effect under vibration and enable the naked&#8208;eye&#8208;visible inhalation of CO2 gas, independently achieving the complete carbon cycle chain from CO2 capture to conversion. The CO2 inhalation and conversion processes in PECRR are revealed by a self&#8208;designed in situ reaction cell. This work brings new insights into the essential mechanism and surface reaction evolution of piezo&#8208;electrocatalysis.

         <dc:description>
An ultrathin metasurface approach utilizing planarized micropillars in discrete phase arrays is demonstrated, and&#160;which is easily fabricated by a&#160;single&#8208;step etching process. This metasurface demonstrates flexibility in the generation of complex acoustic patterns by acoustic holography and has broad potential in applications including high&#8208;frequency acoustic manipulation in microfluidics, cell/tissue engineering, and medical ultrasound.








Abstract
Acoustic metasurfaces offer unique capabilities to steer and direct acoustic fields, though these are generally composed of complex 3D structures, complicating their fabrication and applicability to higher frequencies. Here, an ultrathin metasurface approach is demonstrated,&#160;wherein&#160;planarized micropillars in a discretized phase array&#160;are&#160;utilized. This subwavelength metasurface is easily produced via a single&#8208;step etching process and is suitable for megahertz&#8208;scale applications. The flexibility of this approach is further demonstrated in the production of complex acoustic patterns via acoustic holography. This metasurface approach, with models used to predict their behavior, has broad potential in applications where robust, high&#8208;frequency acoustic manipulation is required, including microfluidics, cell/tissue engineering, and medical ultrasound.

         <title>Single&#8208;crystalline BaZr0.2Ti0.8O3 membranes enabled high energy density in PEI&#8208;based composites for high&#8208;temperature electrostatic capacitors</title>

Abstract
Dielectric capacitors are promising for high power energy storage, but their breakdown strength (Eb) and energy density (Ue) usually degrade rapidly at high temperatures. Adding boron nitride (BN) nanosheets could improve the Eb and high&#8208;temperature endurance but with a limited Ue due to its low dielectric constant. Here, we fabricate freestanding single&#8208;crystalline BaZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (BZT) membranes with high dielectric constant, and introduce them into BN doped polyetherimide (PEI) to obtain laminated PEI&#8208;BN/BZT/PEI&#8208;BN composites. At room temperature, the composite shows a maximum Ue of 17.94 J cm&#8722;3 with the highest Eb of 730 MV m&#8722;1, which is more than two times the pure PEI. Particularly, the composites exhibit excellent dielectric&#8208;temperature stability between 25 and 150&#176;C. An outstanding Ue = 7.90 J cm&#8722;3 is obtained at a relatively large electric field of 650 MV m&#8722;1 under 150&#176;C, which is superior to the most high&#8208;temperature dielectric capacitors reported so far. Phase&#8208;field simulation reveals that the depolarization electric field generated at the BZT/PEI&#8208;BN interfaces could effectively reduce carrier mobility, leading to the remarkable enhancement of the Eb and Ue over a wide temperature range. This work provides a promising and scalable route to develop sandwich&#8208;structured composites with prominent energy storage performances for high&#8208;temperature capacitive applications.

Abstract
Solar driven CO2 reduction by water with a Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction affords an avenue to access energy storage and to alleviate greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, yet the separation of charge carriers and the integrative regulation of water oxidation and CO2 activation sites remain challenging. Here, a BiVO4/g&#8208;C3N4 (BVO/CN) Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction as such a prototype has been constructed by spatially separated dual sites with CoOx clusters and imidazolium ionic liquids (IL) towards CO2 photoreduction. The optimized CoOx&#8208;BVO/CN&#8208;IL delivers a ca. 80&#8208;fold CO production rate without H2 evolution compared with urea&#8208;C3N4 counterpart, together with nearly stoichiometric O2 gas produced. Experimental results and DFT calculations unveil the cascade Z&#8208;scheme charge transfer and subsequently the prominent redox co&#8208;catalysis by CoOx and IL for holes&#8208;H2O oxidation and electrons&#8208;CO2 reduction, respectively. Moreover, in&#8208;situ &#956;s&#8208;transient absorption spectra clearly show the function of each cocatalyst and quantitatively reveal that the resulting CoOx&#8208;BVO/CN&#8208;IL reaches up to the electron transfer efficiency of 36.4% for CO2 reduction, far beyond those for BVO/CN (4.0%) and urea&#8208;CN (0.8%), underlining an exceptional synergy of dual reaction sites engineering. This work provides deep insights and guidelines to the rational design of highly efficient Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction with precise redox catalytic sites toward solar fuel production.

         <title>Unsaturated, Trialkyl Ionizable Lipids are Versatile Lipid&#8208;Nanoparticle Components for Therapeutic and Vaccine Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through rational design and structure&#8211;activity relationship analysis, a library of 16 novel ionizable lipids that use trialkyl structural motifs is screened. A potent trialkyl lipid (&#8220;Lipid 10&#8221;) that demonstrates broad spectrum activity in both therapeutic and vaccine applications is identified. In many cases, it outperforms the leading ionizable lipid benchmarks used in Onpattro, SpikeVax, and Comirnaty.








Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have proven a successful platform for the delivery of nucleic acid (NA)&#8208;based therapeutics and vaccines, with the ionizable lipid component playing a key role in modulating potency and tolerability. Here, a library of 16 novel ionizable lipids is screened hypothesizing that short, branched trialkyl hydrophobic domains can improve LNP fusogenicity or endosomal escape, and potency. LNPs formulated with the top&#8208;performing trialkyl lipid (Lipid 10) encapsulating transthyretin siRNA elicit significantly greater gene silencing and are better tolerated than those with the benchmark Onpattro lipid DLin&#8208;MC3&#8208;DMA. Lipid 10 also demonstrates superior liver delivery of mRNA when compared to other literature ionizable lipids, is well tolerated, and successfully repeat&#8208;doses in nonhuman primates. In a prime&#8208;boost hemagglutinin rodent vaccine model, intramuscular administration of Lipid&#8208;10 LNP elicits comparable or better antibody titers to the SM&#8208;102 and ALC&#8208;0315 lipid compositions used in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved mRNA COVID vaccines. These data suggest that Lipid 10 is a particularly versatile ionizable lipid, well&#8208;suited for both systemic therapeutic and intramuscular vaccine applications and able to successfully deliver diverse NA payloads.

         <title>Alloying of Cu with Ru Enabling the Relay Catalysis for Reduction of Nitrate to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Involving eight electron transfer process and multiple intermediates of nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) leads to a sluggish kinetic and low Faradic efficiency, therefore, it's essential to get an insight into the reaction mechanism to develop highly efficient electrocatalyst. Herein, a series of reduced graphene oxide supported RuCu alloy catalysts (RuxCuy/rGO) were fabricated and used for the direct reduction of NO3&#8722; to NH3. It is found that the Ru1Cu10/rGO shows the ammonia formation rate of 0.38&#160;mmol cm&#8722;2h&#8722;1 (loading 1&#160;mg/cm2) and the ammonia Faradic efficiency (FE) of 98% under an ultralow potential of &#8722;0.05&#160;V versus RHE, which is comparable to Ru catalyst. The highly efficient activity of Ru1Cu10/rGO can be attributed to the synergetic effect between Ru and Cu sites via a relay catalysis, in which the Cu shows the exclusively efficient activity for the reduction of NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722; and Ru exhibits the superior activity for NO2&#8722; to NH3. In addition, the doping of Ru into Cu tunes the d&#8208;band center of alloy and effectively modulates the adsorption energy of the NO3&#8722; and NO2&#8722;, which promotes the direct reduction of NO3&#8722; to NH3. This synergetic electrocatalysis strategy opens a new avenue for developing highly efficient multifunctional catalysts.

         <title>Lipid Deposition Profiles Influence Foreign Body Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fibrosis remains a significant cause of failure in implanted biomedical devices and early absorption of proteins on implant surfaces has been shown to be a key instigating factor. However, lipids can also regulate immune activity and their presence may also contribute to biomaterial&#8208;induced foreign body responses (FBR) and fibrosis. Here we demonstrate that the surface presentation of lipids on implant affects FBR by influencing reactions of immune cells to materials as well as their resultant inflammatory/suppressive polarization. We employed time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF&#8208;SIMS) to characterize lipid deposition on implants that were surface&#8208;modified chemically with immunomodulatory small molecules. Multiple immunosuppressive phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and sphingomyelin) were all found to deposit preferentially on implants with anti&#8208;FBR surface modifications in mice. Significantly, a set of 11 fatty acids was enriched on unmodified implanted devices that failed in both mice and humans, highlighting relevance across species. Phospholipid deposition was also found to upregulate the transcription of anti&#8208;inflammatory genes in murine macrophages, while fatty acid deposition stimulated the expression of pro&#8208;inflammatory genes. These results provide further insights into how to improve the design of biomaterials and medical devices to mitigate biomaterial material&#8208;induced FBR and fibrosis.

         <title>Realization and current&#8208;driven dynamics of fractional hopfions and their ensembles in a helimagnet FeGe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) topological spin textures&#8212;hopfions&#8212;have been predicted in helimagnetic systems but have not been experimentally confirmed thus far. By utilizing external magnetic field and electric current in the present study, 3D topological spin textures were realized, including fractional hopfions with nonzero topological index, in a skyrmion&#8208;hosting helimagnet FeGe. Microsecond current pulses were employed to control the dynamics of the expansion and contraction of a bundle composed of a skyrmion and fractional hopfion, as well as its current&#8208;driven Hall motion. This research approach has demonstrated the novel electromagnetic properties of fractional hopfions and their ensembles in helimagnetic systems.

         <title>Piezoresistive Free&#8208;standing Microfiber Strain Sensor for High&#8208;resolution Battery Thickness Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Highly sensitive microfiber strain sensors are promising for the detection of mechanical deformations in applications where limited space is available. In particular for in&#8208;situ battery thickness monitoring where high resolution and low detection limit are key requirements. Herein, we present the realization of a highly sensitive strain sensor for in&#8208;situ Li&#8208;ion battery thickness monitoring. The compliant fiber&#8208;shaped sensor is fabricated by an upscalable wet&#8208;spinning method employing a composite of microspherical core&#8208;shell conductive particles embedded in an elastomer. The electrical resistance of the sensor changes under applied strain, exhibiting a high strain sensitivity and extremely low strain detection limit of 0.00005 with high durability of 10000 cycles. To demonstrate the accuracy and ease of applicability of our sensor, the real&#8208;time thickness change of a Li&#8208;ion battery pouch cell is monitored during the charge and discharge cycles. Our work introduces a promising approach with the least material complexity for soft microfiber strain gauges.

         <title>Embedded 3D Printing of Architected Ceramics via Microwave&#8208;Activated Polymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microwave&#8208;activated, embedded 3D printing (EMB3D) method is developed to create complex ceramic lattices and interpenetrating architectures with tailored composition, density, and mechanical properties.








Abstract
Light&#8208; and ink&#8208;based 3D printing methods have vastly expanded the design space and geometric complexity of architected ceramics.

&lt;p&gt;Light- and ink-based 3D printing methods have vastly expanded the design space and geometric complexity of architected ceramics. However, light-based methods are typically confined to a relatively narrow range of preceramic and particle-laden resins, while ink-based methods are limited in geometric complexity due to layerwise assembly. Here, embedded 3D printing is combined with microwave-activated curing to generate architected ceramics with spatially controlled composition in freeform shapes.

         <title>An Engineered Living Intestinal Muscle Patch Produces Macroscopic Contractions that can Mix and Break Down Artificial Intestinal Contents</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered intestinal muscle patch is created in vitro to generate three distinct contraction modes. It shows record strength of contractility, strong enough to mix and physically triturate viscoelastic gels that mimic the mechanical properties of the intestinal digesta. Generating such muscle patches depends on both biochemical signals from the medium and environmental cues from a bioscaffold.








Abstract
The intestinal muscle layers execute various gut wall movements to achieve controlled propulsion and mixing of intestinal content. Engineering intestinal muscle layers with complex contractile function is critical for developing bioartificial intestinal tissue to treat patients with short bowel syndrome. Here, the first demonstration of a living intestinal muscle patch capable of generating three distinct motility patterns and displaying multiple digesta manipulations&#160;is reported. Assessment of contractility, cellular morphology, and transcriptome profile reveals that successful generation of the contracting muscle patch relies on both biological factors in a serum&#8208;free medium and environmental cues from an elastic electrospun gelatin scaffold. By comparing gene&#8208;expression patterns among samples, it is shown that biological factors from the medium strongly affect ion&#8208;transport activities, while the scaffold unexpectedly regulates cell&#8211;cell communication. Analysis of ligandreceptor interactome identifies scaffold&#8208;driven changes in intercellular communication, and 78% of the upregulated ligand&#8211;receptor interactions are involved in the development and function of enteric neurons. The discoveries highlight the importance of combining biomolecular and biomaterial approaches for tissue engineering. The living intestinal muscle patch represents a pivotal advancement for building functional replacement intestinal tissue. It offers a more physiological model for studying GI motility and for preclinical drug discovery.

         <title>Electronic State and Microenvironment Modulation of Metal Nanoparticles Stabilized by MOFs for Boosting Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tiny PdCu nanoparticles are encapsulated into a representative metal&#8208;organic framework, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;SO3H, followed by post&#8208;synthetic coating of the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer to afford PdCu@UiO&#8208;S@PDMS composite. Strikingly, the protonated and hydrophobic microenvironment&#160;and electron&#8208;rich PdCu sites endow PdCu@UiO&#8208;S@PDMS with high activity toward the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (Faraday efficiency: 13.16%, yield: 20.24&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1), far superior to the corresponding counterparts.








Abstract
Modulation of the local electronic structure and microenvironment of catalytic metal sites plays a critical role in electrocatalysis, yet remains a grand challenge. Herein, PdCu nanoparticles with an electron rich state are encapsulated into a sulfonate functionalized metal&#8208;organic framework, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;SO3H (simply as UiO&#8208;S), and their microenvironment&#160;is further modulated by coating a hydrophobic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer, affording PdCu@UiO&#8208;S@PDMS. This resultant catalyst presents high activity toward the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR, Faraday efficiency: 13.16%, yield: 20.24&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1), far superior to the corresponding counterparts. Experimental and theoretical results jointly demonstrate that the protonated and hydrophobic microenvironment supplies protons for the NRR yet suppresses the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction reaction, and electron&#8208;rich PdCu sites in PdCu@UiO&#8208;S@PDMS are favorable to formation of the N2H* intermediate and reduce the energy barrier of NRR, thereby accounting for its good performance.

         <title>Nanoimprinted 2D&#8208;Chiral Perovskite Nanocrystal Metasurfaces for Circularly Polarized Photoluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unmodified CsPbBr3 and CsPbBr1I2 perovskite nanocrystals exhibit intense circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) reaching glum values up to 0.15 and 0.3 (with a high index coating) when they are nanostructured into 2D chiral metasurfaces using soft nanoimprinting lithography. The approach is scalable and leads to large areas enabling CPL production from a variety of nanoemitters.








Abstract
The versatile hybrid perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) are one of the most promising materials for optoelectronics by virtue of their tunable bandgaps and high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields. However, their inherent crystalline chemical structure limits the chiroptical properties achievable with the material. The production of chiral perovskites has become an active field of research for its promising applications in optics, chemistry, or biology. Typically, chiral halide perovskites are obtained by the incorporation of different chiral moieties in the material. Unfortunately, these chemically modified perovskites have demonstrated moderate values of chiral PL so far. Here, a general and scalable approach is introduced to produce chiral PL from arbitrary nanoemitters assembled into 2D&#8208;chiral metasurfaces. The fabrication via nanoimprinting lithography employs elastomeric molds engraved with chiral motifs covering millimeter areas that are used to pattern two types of unmodified colloidal perovskite NC inks: green&#8208;emissive CsPbBr3 and red&#8208;emissive CsPbBr1I2. The perovskite 2D&#8208;metasurfaces exhibit remarkable PL dissymmetry factors (glum) of 0.16 that can be further improved up to glum of 0.3 by adding a high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index coating on the metasurfaces. This scalable approach to produce chiral photoluminescent thin films paves the way for the seamless production of bright chiral light sources for upcoming optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Comprehensively Understanding the Role of Anion Vacancies on K&#8208;Ion Storage: A Case Study of Se&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Engineered VSe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Se&#8208;vacancy&#8208;engineered VSe2 is proposed to reveal the role of anion vacancies on the K+ storage of conversion&#8208;type anode materials. The results reveal that Se vacancies boost the first potassiation by offering additional K+ adsorption sites and diffusion channels in the intercalation stage and weakening bond strength in the conversion stage. In addition, Se vacancies disappear&#160;after the first potassiation.








Abstract
Anion vacancy engineering (AVE) is widely used to improve the Li&#8208;ion and Na&#8208;ion storage of conversion&#8208;type anode materials. However, AVE is still an emerging strategy in K&#8208;ion batteries, which are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage. In addition, the role of anion vacancies on ion storage is far from clear, despite several proposed explanations. Herein, by employing VSe2 as a model conversion&#8208;type anode material, Se vacancies are intentionally introduced (labeled as P&#8208;VSe2&#8722;x) to investigate their effect on K+ storage. The P&#8208;VSe2&#8722;x shows excellent cyclability in half cells (143&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 3.0&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles) and high energy density in coin&#8208;type full cells (206.8&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1). By applying various electrochemical techniques, the effects of Se vacancies on the redox potentials of K&#8208;ion insertion/extraction and the K&#8208;ion diffusion in electrodes upon cycling are uncovered. In addition, the structural evolution of Se vacancies during potassiation/de&#8208;potassiation using various operando and ex characterizations is revealed. Moreover, it is demonstrated that Se vacancies can facilitate the breaking of V&#63743;Se bonds upon the P&#8208;VSe2&#8722;x conversion using theoretical calculations. This work comprehensively explains the role of anion vacancies in ion storage for developing high&#8208;performance conversion&#8208;type anode materials.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Synthesis of &#63743;P&#63742;N&#8208;Doped Carbon Nanofibers for Single&#8208;Atom Catalytic Hydrosilylation</title>

         <dc:description>
By using 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidone (NMP) as the carbon source, &#63743;P&#63742;N&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers can be synthesized by NMP&#8211;P2O5 interaction, serving as a superior support to build the single&#8208;atom catalyst for hydrosilylation. Since NMP itself is an outstanding solvent, it is possible to regulate the structure of the carbon nanofibers by dissolving other chemicals/materials.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts have become a popular choice in various catalysis applications, as they take advantages of both homogeneous catalysis (e.g., high efficiency) and heterogeneous catalysis (e.g., easy catalyst recovery). The atom support plays an indispensable role in anchoring atomic species and interplaying with them for ultimate catalytic performance. Therefore, development of new support materials for superior catalysis is of great importance. Here the synthesis of carbon nanofibers based on the reaction between phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) and N&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidone (NMP) is reported. The underlying reaction process is systematically investigated by Fourier&#8208;transform infrared&#160;(FTIR) spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The carbon nanofibers have interesting &#63743;P&#63742;N&#63743; units in their chemical structure, which act as anchoring sites for the single&#8208;atom catalyst. The Pt atoms anchoring carbon nanofibers exhibit high activity for hydrosilylation with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 9.2&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;h&#8722;1 and a selectivity of &gt;99%. This research affords not only a new in situ chemical strategy to synthesize multiatom doped carbon nanofibers but also presents a potential superior support in catalysis, which opens a hopeful window in materials chemistry and catalysis applications.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Amphiphilic Pyridinium Salt and Its Application in the Visualization of Level 3 Details in Latent Fingerprints</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Organic luminescent materials that can simultaneously achieve multimode mechanochromism and its water&#8208;vapor&#8208;induced recovery are desirable for practical applications but rarely reported. Herein, an amphiphilic compound, 4&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;1&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)pyridin&#8208;1&#8208;ium bromide (CPAB), was designed by integrating a lipophilic aromatic unit and hydrophilic end in the molecular architecture. Self&#8208;recovered mechanochromism from brown to cyan was observed upon mechanical grinding in air. Comprehensive research by X&#8208;ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, and single&#8208;crystal analysis revealed that the photoluminescence switch originated from the variation in intermolecular hydrogen bonds and molecular packing mode. The amphiphilic nature of CPAB allowed water molecules to enter the crystalline lattice, forming two polymorphs of the crystalline phase, namely CPAB&#8208;D and CPAB&#8208;W. The hydrosoluble CPAB exhibited excellent capability in probing the level 3 details of fingerprints because its lipophilic part could target the fatty acid residues of fingerprints, leading to strong aggregation&#8208;induced fluorescence. The research may inspire the design of latent fingerprint developers and application in forensics/anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Multileveled Hierarchical Hydrogel with Continuous Biophysical and Biochemical Gradients for Enhanced Repair of Full&#8208;thickness Osteochondral Defect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The repair of hierarchical osteochondral defect requires sophisticated gradient reestablishment; however, few current strategies for continuous gradient casting consider the relevance to clinical practice regarding cell adaptability, multiple gradient elements, and precise gradient mirroring native tissue. Here, a hydrogel with continuous gradients in nano&#8208;hydroxyapatite (HA) content, mechanical, and magnetism are developed using synthesized superparamagnetic HA nanorods (MagHA) that easily respond to a brief magnetic field. To precisely reconstruct osteochondral tissue, we calculate the optimized gradient mode according to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of healthy rabbit knees. Then, MagHA are patterned to form an evidence&#8208;based gradient, consequently generating incremental HA, mechanical, and electromagnetic cues under an external magnetic stimulus from top to bottom matching cartilage&#8208;bone interface. To make such depth&#8208;dependent biocues work, an adaptable hydrogel is developed to conform to cell infiltration. Furthermore, this approach is applied in rabbit full&#8208;thickness osteochondral defects equipped with a local magnetic field. Surprisingly, this multileveled gradient hydrogel repairs osteochondral unit in a perfect heterogeneous feature, which mimics the gradual cartilage&#8208;to&#8208;subchondral transition. Collectively, this is the first study that combines an adaptable hydrogel with magneto&#8208;driven MagHA gradients to achieve promising outcomes in osteochondral regeneration.

         <title>Topology Hierarchy of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides Built from Quantum Spin Hall Layers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The evolution of the physical properties of two&#8208;dimensional material from monolayer limit to the bulk reveals unique consequences from dimension confinement and provides a distinct tuning knob for applications. Monolayer 1T&#8217;&#8208;phase transition metal dichalcogenides (1T&#8217;&#8208;TMDs) with ubiquitous quantum spin Hall (QSH) states are ideal two&#8208;dimensional building blocks of various three&#8208;dimensional topological phases. However, the stacking geometry was previously limited to the bulk 1T&#8217;&#8208;WTe2 type. Here, we introduce the novel 2M&#8208;TMDs consisting of translationally stacked 1T&#8217;&#8208;monolayers as promising material platforms with tunable inverted bandgaps and interlayer coupling. By performing advanced polarization&#8208;dependent angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy as well as first&#8208;principles calculations on the electronic structure of 2M&#8208;TMDs, we revealed a topology hierarchy: 2M&#8208;WSe2, MoS2, and MoSe2 are weak topological insulators (WTIs), whereas 2M&#8208;WS2 is a strong topological insulator (STI). Further demonstration of topological phase transitions by tunning interlayer distance indicates that band inversion amplitude and interlayer coupling jointly determine different topological states in 2M&#8208;TMDs. We propose that 2M&#8208;TMDs are parent compounds of various exotic phases including topological superconductors and promise great application potentials in quantum electronics due to their flexibility in patterning with two&#8208;dimensional materials.

Abstract
The zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NPs) have been well&#8208;documented as an excellent electron transport layer (ETL) in optoelectronic devices. However, the intrinsic surface flaw of the ZnO NPs can easily result in serious surface recombination of carriers. Exploring effective passivation methods of ZnO NPs is essential to maximize the device performance. Herein, we for the first time explore a hybrid strategy to improve the quality of ZnO ETL by incorporating stable organic open&#8208;shell donor&#8208;acceptor type diradicaloids. The high electron&#8208;donating feature of the diradical molecules can efficiently passivate the deep&#8208;level trap states and improve the conductivity of ZnO NP film. The unique advantage of the radical strategy is that its passivation effectiveness is highly correlated with the electron&#8208;donating ability of radical molecules, which can be precisely controlled by the rational design of molecular chemical structures. The well&#8208;passivated ZnO ETL is applied in lead sulfide (PbS) colloidal quantum dot (CQD) solar cells, delivering a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.54%. More importantly, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, this work will inspire the exploration of general strategies using radical molecules to construct high&#8208;efficiency solution&#8208;processed optoelectronic devices.

Abstract
The limited selection pool of high&#8208;performance wide band gap (WBG) polymer donors is a bottleneck problem of the nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) based organic solar cells (OSCs) that impedes the further improvement of their photovoltaic performances. Herein, a series of new WBG polymers, namely PH&#8208;BTz, PS&#8208;BTz, PF&#8208;BTz, and PCl&#8208;BTz, were developed by using the bicyclic difluoro&#8208;benzo[d]thiazole (BTz) as the acceptor block and benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene (BDT) derivatives as the donor units. By introducing S, F and Cl atoms to the alkylthienyl sidechains on BDT, the resulting polymers exhibited lowered energy levels and enhanced aggregation properties. The fluorinated PBTz&#8208;F not only exhibited a low&#8208;lying HOMO level, but also had stronger face&#8208;on packing order and resulted in more uniform fibril&#8208;like interpenetrating networks in the related PF&#8208;BTz:L8&#8208;BO blend. A high&#8208;power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.57% was achieved. Moreover, PBTz&#8208;F also exhibited a good batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch reproducibility and general applicability. In addition, ternary blend OSCs based on the host PBTz&#8208;F:L8&#8208;BO blend and PM6 guest donor exhibited a further enhanced PCE of 19.54%, which is among the highest values of OSCs.

         <title>Programmably Controllable Delivery of Metastable Ferrous Ions for Multiscale Dynamic Imaging Guided Photothermal Primed Chemodynamic Therapy</title>

Abstract
Metallo&#8208;modulation cell death strategies have been extensively investigated for antitumor therapy, such as cuproptosis, ferroptosis, chemodynamic therapy (CDT), etc. Undoubtedly, the accurate and specific elevation of metal ions levels in cancer cells is key to boosting the therapeutic index of these strategies. Herein, a programmably controllable delivery system is developed based on croconium dye (Croc)&#8208;ferrous ion (Fe2+) nanoprobes (denoted as CFNPs) for multiscale dynamic imaging guided photothermal primed CDT. The Croc with kinds of electron&#8208;rich iron&#8208;chelating groups can form the Croc&#8208;Fe2+ complex with a precise stoichiometry of 1:1 to steadily maintain the valence state of Fe2+. The CFNPs could achieve pH&#8208;responsive visualization of cancerous tissues, and accurate release of Fe2+ in tumor tissues under the coactivation of &#8220;dual&#8208;key&#8221; stimulation of &#8220;acidity and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8221;. The acidic tumor microenvironment actuates NIR fluorescence/photoacoustic imaging and photothermal properties of CFNPs. Sequentially, under exogenous NIR light, the CFNPs enable the in vivo accurate visualization of Croc&#8208;Fe2+ complex delivery for photothermal primed Fe2+ release, thus achieving CDT of tumors. By leveraging multiscale dynamic imaging technologies, we not only sketch the complicated spatiotemporal release of Fe2+ in a programmably controllable manner, but also reveal the domino effect of tumor pH level, photothermal effect, and CDT, endowing the customized feedback of therapeutic panorama within disease microenvironment.

         <title>Hydrogel with Robust Adhesion in Various Liquid Environments by Electrostatic&#8208;Induced Hydrophilic and Hydrophobic Polymer Chains Migration and Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pressure&#8208;sensitive hydrogel exhibits robust adhesion in aqueous solution and oil environments by electrostatic&#8208;induced hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer chains migration and rearrangement, which realizes the removal of the interfacial liquid layer and the effective interfacial bonding during wet adhesion. This polymer&#8208;chains&#8208;regulated hydrogel provides a new strategy for adhesion in liquid environments, broadening the application scenarios of adhesives.








Abstract
Hydrogels with wet adhesion are promising interfacial adhesive materials; however, their adhesion in water, oil, or organic solvents remains a major challenge. To address this, a pressure&#8208;sensitive P(AAm&#8208;co&#8208;C18)/PTA&#8208;Fe hydrogel is fabricated, which exhibits robust adhesion to various substrates in both aqueous solutions and oil environments. It is demonstrated that the key to wet adhesion under liquid conditions is the removal of the interfacial liquid, which can be achieved through rational molecular composition regulation. By complexing with hydrophilic polymer networks, phosphotungstic acid (PTA) is introduced into the hydrogel network as a physical cross&#8208;linker and anchor point to improve the cohesion strength and drive the migration of polymer chains. The migration and rearrangement of hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer chains on the hydrogel surface are induced by the electrostatic interactions of Fe3+, which create a surface with interfacial water&#8208; and oil&#8208;removing properties. By co&#8208;regulating the hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer chains, the P(AAm&#8208;co&#8208;C18)/PTA&#8208;Fe hydrogel is able to act as a pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesive under water and oils with adhesion strength of 92.6 and 90.0&#160;kPa, respectively. It is anticipated that this regulation strategy for polymer chains will promote the development of wet adhesion hydrogels, which can have a wide range of applications.

         <title>Dynamically Interfacial pH&#8208;Buffering Effect Enabled by N&#8208;Methylimidazole Molecules as Spontaneous Proton Pumps toward Highly Reversible Zinc&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamically interfacial pH&#8208;buffering strategy implemented by N&#8208;methylimidazole (NMI) which acts as a spontaneous proton pump, is proposed to remove the detrimental OH&#8722; at zinc/electrolyte interface in real&#8208;time. An in situ interfacial pH detection method with micro&#8208;sized spatial resolution based on the ultra&#8208;microelectrode technology is developed to probe pH evolution in the diffusion layer.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries have attracted extensive attention due to their outstanding merits of high safety and low cost. However, the intrinsic thermodynamic instability of zinc in aqueous electrolyte inevitably results in hydrogen evolution, and the consequent generation of OH&#8722; at the interface will dramatically exacerbate the formation of dead zinc and dendrites. Herein, a dynamically interfacial pH&#8208;buffering strategy implemented by N&#8208;methylimidazole (NMI) additive is proposed to remove the detrimental OH&#8722; at zinc/electrolyte interface in real&#8208;time, thus eliminating the accumulation of by&#8208;products fundamentally. Electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance and molecular dynamics simulation results reveal the existence of an interfacial absorption layer assembled by NMI and protonated NMI (NMIH+), which acts as an ion pump for replenishing the interface with protons constantly. Moreover, an in situ interfacial pH detection method with micro&#8208;sized spatial resolution based on the ultra&#8208;microelectrode technology is developed to probe the pH evolution in diffusion layer, confirming the stabilized interfacial chemical environment in NMI&#8208;containing electrolyte. Accordingly, with the existence of NMI, an excellent cumulative plating capacity of 4.2 Ah cm&#8722;2 and ultrahigh Coulombic efficiency of 99.74% are realized for zinc electrodes. Meanwhile, the NMI/NMIH+ buffer additive can accelerate the dissolution/deposition process of MnO2/Mn2+ on the cathode, leading to enhanced cycling capacity.

         <title>Encapsulating High&#8208;Temperature Superconducting Twisted van der Waals Heterostructures Blocks Detrimental Effects of Disorder</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method of fabricating high&#8208;temperature&#8208;superconductor&#8208;based van der Waals heterostructures is reported. The novel method utilizing the encapsulating heterostructure's interface overcomes detrimental effects of disorder and enables crucial improvement of the characteristics of the Josephson junction constituting the core of the proposed van der Waals material. The designed heterostructures operating at elevated temperatures holds potential for emerging quantum technologies.








Abstract
High&#8208;temperature cuprate superconductors based van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures hold high technological promise. One of the obstacles hindering their progress is the detrimental effect of disorder on the properties of the vdW&#8208;devices&#8208;based Josephson junctions (JJs). Here, a new method of fabricating twisted vdW heterostructures made of Bi2Sr2CuCa2O8+&#948;, crucially improving the JJ characteristics and pushing them up to those of the intrinsic JJs in bulk samples, is reported. The method combines cryogenic stacking using a solvent&#8208;free stencil mask technique and covering the interface by insulating hexagonal boron nitride crystals. Despite the high&#8208;vacuum condition down to 10&#8722;6 mbar in the evaporation chamber, the interface appears to be protected from water molecules during the in situ metal deposition only when fully encapsulated. Comparing the current&#8211;voltage curves of encapsulated and unencapsulated interfaces, it is revealed that the encapsulated interfaces&#8217; characteristics are crucially improved, so that the corresponding JJs demonstrate high critical currents and sharpness of the superconducting transition comparable to those of the intrinsic JJs. Finally, it is shown that the encapsulated heterostructures are more stable over&#160;time.

Here, a new method of fabricating twisted vdW heterostructures made of Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuCa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8+&#948;&lt;/sub&gt;, crucially improving the JJ characteristics and pushing them up to those of the intrinsic JJs in bulk samples, is reported. The method combines cryogenic stacking using a solvent-free stencil mask technique and covering the interface by insulating hexagonal boron nitride crystals. Despite the high-vacuum condition down to 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;6&lt;/sup&gt; mbar in the evaporation chamber, the interface appears to be protected from water molecules during the in situ metal deposition only when fully encapsulated. Comparing the current&#8211;voltage curves of encapsulated and unencapsulated interfaces, it is revealed that the encapsulated interfaces&#8217; characteristics are crucially improved, so that the corresponding JJs demonstrate high critical currents and sharpness of the superconducting transition comparable to those of the intrinsic JJs. Finally, it is shown that the encapsulated heterostructures are more stable over&#160;time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pt&#8208;Quantum&#8208;Dot&#8208;Modified Sulfur&#8208;Doped NiFe Layered Double Hydroxide for High&#8208;Current&#8208;Density Alkaline Water Splitting at Industrial Temperature</title>

         <dc:description>
To obtain exceptional performance for industrial water splitting at high current densities, Pt&#8208;quantum&#8208;dot&#8208;modified NiFe layered double hydroxides are designed. Benefiting from optimized mass transfer and enhanced hydrogen release, its mass activity is 2.7 times higher than that of 40% Pt/C in hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Suitable electrocatalysts for industrial water splitting can veritably promote practical hydrogen applications. Rational surface design is exceptionally significant for electrocatalysts to bridge the gap between fundamental science and industrial expectation in water splitting. Here, Pt&#8208;quantum&#8208;dot&#8208;modified sulfur&#8208;doped NiFe layered double hydroxides (Pt@S&#8211;NiFe LDHs) are designed with eximious catalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under industrial&#160;condition. Benefiting from enhanced binding energy, mass transfer, and hydrogen release, Pt@S&#8211;NiFe LDHs exhibit outstanding activity in HER at high current densities. Notably, it obtains an impressively low overpotential of 71&#160;mV and long&#8208;term stability of 200 h at 100 mA cm&#8722;2, exceeding commercial 40% Pt/C and most reported Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Its mass activity is 2.7 times higher than that of 40% Pt/C with an overpotential of 100 mV. Furthermore, at industrial temperature (65&#160;&#176;C), the electrolyzer based on Pt@S&#8211;NiFe LDH needs just 1.62 V to reach the current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, superior to that of the commercial one of 40% Pt/C//IrO2. This work provides rational ideas to develop electrocatalysts with exceptional performance for industrial high&#8208;temperature water splitting at high current densities.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Zn&#63743;N5 Sites Immobilized on g&#8208;C3N4 Nanosheets for Ultrasensitive Selective Detection of Phenanthrene by Dual Ratiometric Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed Zn(II)&#63743;N5 sites are immobilized on g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets for detecting phenanthrene (PHE) by dual ratiometric fluorescence with ultrahigh sensitivity (limit of detection = 0.35 ng L&#8722;1) and selectivity among typical polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons due to favorable selective adsorption of PHE on as&#8208;constructed atomic Zn(II)&#63743;N5 sites via the ionic cation&#8211;&#960; interactions (Zn&#948;+&#63743;C2&#948;&#8722; type).








Abstract
Ultrasensitively selective detection of trace polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) like phenanthrene (PHE) is critical but remains challenging. Herein, atomically dispersed Zn sites on g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets (sZn&#8208;CN) are constructed by thermal polymerization of a Zn&#8211;cyanuric acid&#8211;melamine supramolecular precursor for the fluorescence detection of PHE. A high amount (1.6 wt%) of sZn is grafted in the cave of CN with one N vacancy in the form of unique Zn(II)&#63743;N5 coordination. The optimized sZn&#8208;CN achieves a wide detection range (1 ng L&#8722;1 to 5 mg L&#8722;1), ultralow detection limit (0.35 ng L&#8722;1, with 5&#8208;order magnitude improvement over CN), and ultrahigh selectivity toward PHE even among typical PAHs based on the built PHE&#8208;CN dual ratiometric fluorescence method. By means of in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, time&#8208;resolved absorption&#160;and fluorescence spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations, the resulting superior detection performance is attributed to the favorable selective adsorption of PHE on as&#8208;constructed atomic Zn(II)&#63743;N5 sites via the ionic cation&#8211;&#960; interactions (Zn&#948;+&#63743;C2&#948;&#8722; type), and the fluorescence quenching is dominated by the inner filter effect (IFE) from the multilayer adsorption of PHE at low concentrations, while it is done by the protruded photogenerated electron&#8208;transfer process, as well as IFE from the monolayer adsorption of PHE at ultralow concentration.

         <title>In Situ Generation of Red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR Emissive Radical Cations in the Stomach for Gastrointestinal Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Red&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared&#160;(NIR) fluorescent probes are promising for gastrointestinal disease studies with the advantages of deep penetration and high sensitivity. However, conventional fluorophores feature electron closed&#8208;shell structures and require tedious procedures for preparation. Herein, it is found that red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR emissive and stable pyrrole radical cations can be quickly generated in situ in an acidic stomach after gavage with simple pyrroles, which can be used for gastrointestinal imaging with high spatiotemporal resolution and anti&#8208;gastric&#8208;acid therapy assessment with excellent sensitivity.








Abstract
Red&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent probes, with advantages such as high spatiotemporal resolution and in situ sensing abilities,&#160;are highly attractive for diagnosis of gastrointestinal diseases and targeted drug development. However, conventional red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR fluorophores with electron closed&#8208;shell structures require tedious synthetic procedures for preparation, and it is difficult to further decorate them with sensing groups. In this study, a series of easily prepared pyrroles with simple structures that can quickly be transformed into red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR emissive radical cations in acidic buffer solution and in vivo stomachs is developed. The in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR emissive pyrrole radical cations in the stomach have excellent biocompatibility and stability and can be used not only for intravital gastrointestinal imaging with high spatiotemporal resolution, but also for dynamic monitoring of the gastric emptying process and assessment of anti&#8208;gastric&#8208;acid therapy. The acidity&#8208;induced generation of pyrrole radical cations is believed to provide a facile strategy for developing red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR fluorophores and studying gastrointestinal diseases.

         <title>A Facile and Rational Method to Tailor the Symmetry of Au@Ag Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and rational method to tailor the symmetry of Au@Ag nanoparticles is reported. By introducing l&#8208;cysteine into the growth system, truncated cuboids/octahedra, well&#8208;defined octahedra, and tetrahedra can be readily obtained with the increase of Ag precursor concentration. Among them, the truncated cuboids/octahedra are chiral, and their formation can be seen as a result of dissymmetric synthesis.








Abstract
Precisely controlling the morphologies of plasmonic metal nanoparticles (NPs) is of great importance for many applications. Here, a facile seed&#8208;mediated growth method is demonstrated that tailors the morphologies of Au@Ag NPs from cubes/cuboids to chiral truncated cuboids/octahedra, well&#8208;defined octahedra, and tetrahedra, via simply increasing the concentrations of AgNO3&#160;and cysteine in the halide surfactant systems. Accordingly, the particle symmetries are also tuned. The method is quite robust where seeds with distinct shapes including irregular ones can all lead to uniform Au@Ag NPs. The evolution of these shapes can be illustrated by a recently proposed symmetry&#8208;based kinematic theory (SBKT). Furthermore, SBKT shows a strategy to optimize the preparation of chiral/dissymmetric NPs, and the experimental results confirm such a dissymmetric synthesis strategy. Cuboids and octahedra with corners differently truncated are identified as two different chiral forms. The chirality of the NPs is additionally probed by electrochemistry, where the chiral NPs show enantioselectivity in the oxidation of d&#8208; and l&#8208;glucose. Altogether, the results gain fundamental insights into tailoring the plasmonic NP morphologies, and also suggest strategies to obtain chiral NPs.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Energy&#8208;Regulated Growth of &#945;&#8208;Phase Cs0.03FA0.97PbI3 for Highly Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
Halogenated propeller&#8208;shaped ammonium is synthesized and applied to reduce the surface energy and prompt the formation of the &#945;&#8208;phase CsxFA1&#8722;xPbI3 perovskite structure, which generates a record efficiency of 23.6% for CsxFA1&#8722;xPbI3&#8208;based inverted structural perovskite solar cells with excellent stability.








Abstract
Methylammonium (MA)&#8208;free formamidinium (FA)&#8208;dominated CsxFA1&#8722;xPbI3 is rising as the most promising candidate for highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells. However, the growth of high&#8208;quality CsxFA1&#8722;xPbI3 black&#8208;phase perovskite structure without ion doping in the lattice remains a challenge. Herein, propeller&#8208;shaped halogenated tertiary ammonium is synthesized, showing high binding energy on the perovskite surface and large steric hindrance. This molecule can significantly reduce the barrier of high surface energy that suppresses the growth of the &#945;&#8208;phase CsxFA1&#8722;xPbI3 structure. As a result, the &#945;&#8208;phase structure can be formed at room temperature, which can further act as a seed for the growth of high&#8208;quality film. Solar cells based on the film show a record efficiency up to 23.6% for MA free CsxFA1&#8722;xPbI3 solar cells with inverted structure and excellent stability at 85&#160;&#176;C over 200&#160;h.

         <title>Dramatically Accelerated Formation of Graphite Intercalation Compounds Catalyzed by Sodium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pellets of graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) are synthesized by the Na&#8208;catalyzed method. AM&#8211;GICs (AM&#160;= Li, Na, K) are formed simply by mixing AM and graphite with Na at room temperature. A&#160;Ca&#8208;GIC&#160;(CaC6) is formed&#160;by heating a mixture of Ca, graphite, and Na at 250 &#176;C for only several hours.








Abstract
Graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) have a variety of functions due to their rich material variations, and thus, innovative methods for their synthesis are desired for practical applications. It is discovered that Na has a catalytic property that dramatically accelerates the formation of GICs. It is demonstrated that LiC6n (n&#160;= 1, 2), KC8, KC12n (n&#160;= 2, 3, 4), and NaCx are synthesized simply by mixing alkali metals and graphite powder with Na at room temperature (&#8776;25&#160;&#176;C), and AEC6 (AE&#160;= Ca, Sr, Ba) are synthesized by heating Na&#8208;added reagents at 250&#160;&#176;C only for a few hours. The NaCx, formed by the mixing of C and Na, is understood to act as a reaction intermediate for a catalyst, thereby accelerating the formation of GICs by lowering the activation energy of intercalation. The Na&#8208;catalyzed method, which enables the rapid and mass synthesis of homogeneous GIC samples in a significantly simpler manner than conventional methods, is anticipated to stimulate research and development for GIC applications.

         <title>An Active Pixel&#8208;Matrix Electrocaloric Device for Targeted and Differential Thermal Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient pixel&#8208;matrix electrocaloric (EC) cooling device is demonstrated on which each refrigeration pixel can be independently controlled and can effectively cool down the localized overheating on microelectronics in situ as needed. All active pixels in the EC cooling device exhibit a stable temperature span of 4.6 K and a heat flux of 62&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8208;1.








Abstract
More than 55% of electronic failures are caused by damage from localized overheating. Up to now, there is still no efficient method for targeted temperature control against localized overheating. Although some existing thermal management devices handle this issue by full coverage cooling, it generates a lot of useless energy consumption. Here, a highly efficient pixel&#8208;matrix electrocaloric (EC) cooling device is reported, which can realize a targeted and differential thermal management. The modified poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;tertrifluoroethylene&#8208;chlorofluoroethylene) reaches a large adiabatic temperature change of 7.8 K and is more suitable for thermal transfer and electrostatic actuation at high frequencies. All active pixels in the EC cooling device exhibit a stable temperature span of 4.6 K and a heat flux of 62&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8208;2, which is more than twice that of the one&#8208;layer EC device. Each refrigeration pixel can be independently controlled and effectively cooled down the localized overheating site(s) in situ. The surface temperature of the simulated central processing unit decreases by 33.2 K at 120 s after applying this EC device. Such a compact, embeddable, low cost, and active solid&#8208;state pixel&#8208;matrix cooling device has great potential for localized overheating protection in microelectronics.

         <title>Flattening Grain&#8208;Boundary Grooves for Perovskite Solar Cells with High Optomechanical Reliability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grain&#8208;boundary grooves are found to have important effects on the properties of perovskite heterointerfaces and thus the device performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Especially, flattening grain&#8208;boundary grooves elevates the (opto&#8208;)mechanical reliability, contributing to device efficiency and stability enhancement.








Abstract
Optomechanical reliability has emerged as an important criterion for evaluating the performance and commercialization potential of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to the mechanical&#8208;property mismatch of metal halide perovskites with other device layer. In this work, grain&#8208;boundary grooves, a rarely discussed film microstructural characteristic, are found to impart significant effects on the optomechanical reliability of perovskite&#8211;substrate heterointerfaces and thus PSC performance. By pre&#8208;burying iso&#8208;butylammonium chloride additive in the electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL), GB grooves (GBGs) are flattened and an optomechanically reliable perovskite heterointerface that resists photothermal fatigue is created. The improved mechanical integrity of the ETL&#8211;perovskite heterointerfaces also benefits the charge transport and chemical stability by facilitating carrier injection and reducing moisture or solvent trapping, respectively. Accordingly, high&#8208;performance PSCs which exhibit efficiency retentions of 94.8% under 440 h damp heat test (85% RH and 85 &#176;C), and 93.0% under 2000 h continuous light soaking are achieved.

         <title>Extremely Robust and Multifunctional Nanocomposite Fibers for Strain&#8208;Unperturbed Textile Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extremely robust and multifunctional nanocomposite fiber is fabricated by introducing a mechanically interlocked network inside the fibrous structure. The fiber obtains strong resistance against structural crack formation and propagation, and the fiber&#8208;based textile electronics show exceptional robustness. The textile&#8208;based electromechanical sensors exhibited strain&#8208;unalterable sensing performance and fiber&#8208;shaped supercapacitors showed invariant electrochemical performance during large and cyclic strain perturbations.








Abstract
Textile electronics are needed that can achieve strain&#8208;unaltered performance when they undergo irregular and repeated strain deformation. Such strain&#8208;unaltered textile electronics require advanced fibers that simultaneously have high functionalities and extreme robustness as fabric materials. Current synthetic nanocomposite fibers based on inorganic matrix have remarkable functionalities but often suffer from low robustness and poor tolerance against crack formation.

Moreover, the high electrical conductivity (&gt;1.1 &#215; 105 S m&#8722;1) and electrochemical performance (&gt;360 F cm&#8722;3) of the nanocomposite fiber can be well retained after subjecting the fiber to extensive (&gt;25% strain) and long&#8208;term repeated (10&#8201;000 cycles) dimensional changes.

&lt;p&gt;An extremely robust and multifunctional nanocomposite fiber is fabricated by introducing a mechanically interlocked network inside the fibrous structure. The fiber obtains strong resistance against structural crack formation and propagation, and the fiber-based textile electronics show exceptional robustness. The textile-based electromechanical sensors exhibited strain-unalterable sensing performance and fiber-shaped supercapacitors showed invariant electrochemical performance during large and cyclic strain perturbations.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Textile electronics are needed that can achieve strain-unaltered performance when they undergo irregular and repeated strain deformation. Such strain-unaltered textile electronics require advanced fibers that simultaneously have high functionalities and extreme robustness as fabric materials. Current synthetic nanocomposite fibers based on inorganic matrix have remarkable functionalities but often suffer from low robustness and poor tolerance against crack formation. Here,&#160;we&#160;present a design for a high-performance multifunctional nanocomposite fiber that is mechanically and electrically robust, which&#160;was&#160;realized by crosslinking titanium carbide (MXene) nanosheets with a slide-ring polyrotaxane to form an internal mechanically-interlocked network. This inorganic matrix nanocomposite fiber featured distinct strain-hardening mechanical behavior and exceptional load-bearing capability (toughness approaching 60 MJ m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; and ductility over 27%). It retained 100% of its ductility after cyclic strain loading. Moreover, the high electrical conductivity (&amp;gt;1.1 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; S m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and electrochemical performance (&amp;gt;360 F cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;) of the nanocomposite fiber can be well retained after subjecting the fiber to extensive (&amp;gt;25% strain) and long-term repeated (10&#8201;000 cycles) dimensional changes.

Abstract
Freshwater scarcity is a global challenge posing threats to the lives and daily activities of humankind such that two&#8208;thirds of the global population currently experience water shortages. Atmospheric water, irrespective of geographical location, is considered as an alternative water source. Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH) has recently emerged as an efficient strategy for decentralized water production. SAWH thus opens up a self&#8208;sustaining source of freshwater that can potentially support the global population for various applications. In this review, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of SAWH, considering its operation principle, thermodynamic analysis, energy assessment, materials, components, different designs, productivity improvement, scale&#8208;up, and application for drinking water are first extensively explored. Thereafter, the practical integration and potential application of SAWH, beyond drinking water, for wide range of utilities in agriculture, fuel/electricity production, thermal management in building services, electronic devices, and textile are comprehensively discussed. The various strategies to reduce human reliance on natural water resources by integrating SAWH into existing technologies, particularly in underdeveloped countries, in order to satisfy the interconnected needs for food, energy, and water are also examined. This study further highlights the urgent need and future research directions to intensify the design and development of hybrid&#8208;SAWH systems for sustainability and diverse applications.

         <title>Gate Dielectrics Integration for 2D Electronics: Challenges, Advances, and Outlook</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent development of dielectrics for high&#8208;performance 2D devices. Adapting integration protocols of conventional high&#8208;&#954; dielectrics and emerging dielectrics with inert surface can significantly improve the dielectric film and interface quality. The advancement of novel dielectrics boosts overall performance of 2D devices and paves way toward next&#8208;generation nanoelectronics.








Abstract
2D semiconductors have emerged both as an ideal platform for fundamental studies and as promising channel materials in beyond&#8208;silicon field&#8208;effect&#8208;transistors due to their outstanding electrical properties and exceptional tunability via external field. However, the lack of proper dielectrics for 2D semiconductors has become a major roadblock for their further development toward practical applications. The prominent issues between conventional 3D dielectrics and 2D semiconductors arise from the integration and interface quality, where defect states and imperfections lead to dramatic deterioration of device performance. In this review article, the root causes of such issues are briefly analyzed and recent advances on some possible solutions, including various approaches of adapting conventional dielectrics to 2D semiconductors, and the development of novel dielectrics with van der Waals surface toward high&#8208;performance 2D electronics are summarized. Then, in the perspective, the requirements of ideal dielectrics for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 2D devices are outlined and an outlook for their future development is provided.

         <title>Simultaneous Oxidative Cleavage of Lignin and Reduction of Furfural via Efficient Electrocatalysis by P&#8208;Doped CoMoO4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
P&#8208;doping&#8208;induced lattice growth of CoMoO4 increases crystal defects and causes the D&#8208;band center to migrate higher to obtain the appropriate adsorption energy and significantly lower overpotential, therefore this system performs well in lignin oxidation breakage and furfural reduction.








Abstract
Electrochemical oxidative lignin cleavage and coupled 2&#8208;furaldehyde reduction provide a promising approach for producing high&#8208;value added products. However, developing efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts with noble&#8208;metal&#8208;like activity still remains a challenge. Here, an efficient electrochemical strategy is reported for the selective oxidative cleavage of C&#945;&#8211;C&#946; bonds in lignin into aromatic monomers by tailoring the electronic structure through P&#8208;doped CoMoO4 spinels (99% conversion, highest monomer selectivity of 56%). Additionally, the conversion and selectivity of 2&#8208;furaldehyde reduction to 2&#8208;methyl furan reach 87% and 73%, respectively. In situ Fourier transform infrared and density functional theory analysis reveal that an upward shift of the Ed upon P&#8208;doping leads to an increase in the antibonding level, which facilitates the C&#945;&#8211;C&#946; adsorption of the lignin model compounds, thereby enhancing the bifunctional electrocatalytic activity of the active site. This work explores the potential of a spinel as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for the oxidative cracking of lignin and the reductive conversion of small organic molecules to high&#8208;value added chemicals via P&#8208;anion modulation.

         <title>A Polymorphic Memtransistor with Tunable Metallic and Semiconducting Channel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymorphic memtransistor based on atomically thin Mo0.91W0.09Te2 is achieved, where the lateral device channel can be tuned as metallic and semiconducting for diverse neuromorphic and in&#8208;memory computing.








Abstract
Modulating semiconducting channel potential has been used for electrical switching in transistors without biological plasticity operations that are critical for energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic computing. To achieve efficient data processing, alternative transport mechanisms, such as tunneling and thermionic emission, have been introduced with 2D materials. Here, a polymorphic memtransistor based on atomically thin Mo0.91W0.09Te2 is presented, where the lattice and electronic structures of the lateral device channel can be tuned as either metallic (1T&#8242;) or semiconducting (2H) phases by electrical gating. The structural and electronic phase change of the channel material, optimized in Mo0.91W0.09Te2, is explored using transport and optical measurements at the device scale. Based on the phase transition, the polymorphic memtransistor demonstrates a high on/off ratio (up to 105), low subthreshold swing (down to 80&#160;mV dec&#8722;1), and various memristive behaviors, which are distinguished from traditional phase&#8208;change memory, transistors, and passive memristors for diverse neuromorphic and in&#8208;memory computing.

         <title>Optically Tunable Transient Plasmons in InSb Nanowires</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The narrow bandgap and small electron effective mass enable InSb to support plasmons with sensitive optical tunability in the mid&#8208;infrared region. By using the time&#8208;resolved optical nanoscopy, the resonance plasmon is successfully switched in an individual InSb nanowire. By controlling the photoinduced electron yield, a sensitive modulation of the plasmon frequency is achieved by one octave.








Abstract
Optical carrier incubation can effectively alter the electron transport properties of semiconductors; thus, optical switching of the plasmonic response of the semiconductor enables the ultrafast manipulation of the light at the nanoscale. Semiconductor nanostructures are promising platforms in on&#8208;chip high&#8208;speed plasmonic devices, owing to their high photoinduced electron injection efficiency at sub&#8208;picosecond and compatibility with contemporary semiconductor technologies. The pure single crystalline InSb nanowires are promising plasmonic materials in the mid&#8208;infrared region due to their high electron mobility and small electron effective mass. Here, the pump&#8211;probe nanoscopy is utilized to investigate the pump fluence dependency and the dynamics of the non&#8208;equilibrium plasmons in the InSb nanowires. The InSb plasmon is successfully switched by injecting the photoinduced electrons and the practical tuning of the plasmon frequency to one octave is shown by increasing the pump fluence from 0 to 90&#160;&#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2. The density of the photoinduced electrons in InSb nanowires is 18.8&#160;&#215;&#160;1018&#160;cm&#8722;3 with pump fluence as low as 90&#160;&#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2. The high electron mobility of the InSb supports the low&#8208;loss plasmon with a damping rate of &#8776;200&#160;cm&#8722;1. The InSb nanowires&#8217; excellent plasmonic properties ensure that they are a promising platform for upcoming high&#8208;speed mid&#8208;infrared plasmonic materials for informatic devices.

&lt;p&gt;The narrow bandgap and small electron effective mass enable InSb to support plasmons with sensitive optical tunability in the mid-infrared region. By using the time-resolved optical nanoscopy, the resonance plasmon is successfully switched in an individual InSb nanowire. By controlling the photoinduced electron yield, a sensitive modulation of the plasmon frequency is achieved by one octave.

         <title>Achieving Ferroelectricity in a Centrosymmetric High&#8208;Performance Semiconductor by Strain Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Phase engineering by strain in 2D semiconductors is of great importance for a variety of applications. Here, we present a study of the strain&#8208;induced ferroelectric (FE) transition in bismuth oxyselenide (Bi2O2Se) films, a high&#8208;performance (HP) semiconductor for next&#8208;generation electronics. Bi2O2Se is not FE at ambient pressure. At a loading force of &#8819; 400 nN, the piezoelectric force responses exhibit butterfly loops in magnitude and 180o phase switching. By carefully ruling out extrinsic factors, these features are attributed to a transition to the FE phase. The transition is further supported by the appearance of a sharp peak in optical second harmonic generation under uniaxial strain. In general, solids with paraelectrics at ambient pressure and FE under strain are rare. The FE transition is discussed using first&#8208;principles calculations and theoretical simulations. The switching of FE polarization acts as a knob for Schottky barrier engineering at contacts and serves as the basis for a memristor with a huge on/off current ratio of 106. Our work adds a new degree of freedom to a HP electronic/optoelectronic semiconductor, and the integration of FE and HP semiconductivity paves the way for many exciting functionalities, including HP neuromorphic computing and bulk&#160;piezophotovoltaics.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Quenching NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;Aggregates of Benzo[c]thiophene Fluorophore for Highly Efficient Bioimaging and Phototheranostics</title>

Abstract
Molecular fluorophores with the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) emission hold great potential for deep&#8208;tissue bioimaging owing to their excellent biocompatibility and high resolution. Recently, J&#8208;aggregates are used to construct long&#8208;wavelength NIR&#8208;II emitters as their optical bands show remarkable red shifts upon forming water&#8208;dispersible nano&#8208;aggregates. However, their wide applications in the NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging are impeded by the limited varieties of J&#8208;type backbone and serious fluorescence quenching. Herein, we report a bright benzo[c]thiophene (BT) J&#8208;aggregate fluorophore (BT6) with anti&#8208;quenching effect for highly efficient NIR&#8208;II bioimaging and phototheranostics. The BT fluorophores are manipulated to have Stokes shift over 400&#160;nm and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) property for conquering the self&#8208;quenching issue of the J&#8208;type fluorophores. Upon forming BT6 assemblies in an aqueous environment, the absorption over 800&#160;nm and NIR&#8208;II emission over 1000&#160;nm are boosted for more than 41 and 26 folds, respectively. In vivo visualization of the whole&#8208;body blood vessel and imaging&#8208;guided phototherapy results verify that BT6 NPs are excellent agent for NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging and cancer phototheranostics. This work develops a strategy to construct bright NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates with precisely manipulated anti&#8208;quenching properties for highly efficient biomedical applications.

         <title>Achieving high quantum efficiency broadband NIR Mg4Ta2O9:Cr3+ phosphor through lithium ion compensation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ultra&#8208;efficient broadband near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diodes (pc&#8208;LEDs) are urgently needed to improve the detection sensitivity and spatial resolution of current smart NIR spectroscopy&#8208;based techniques. Nonetheless, the performance of NIR pc&#8208;LED have severely limited owing to the external quantum efficiency (EQE) bottleneck of NIR light&#8208;emitting materials. Herein, we advantageously modified a blue LED excitable Cr3+&#8208;doped tetramagnesium ditalate (Mg4Ta2O9, MT) phosphor through lithium ion as a key efficient broadband NIR emitter to achieve high optical output power of NIR light source. The emission spectrum encompasses the 700&#8211;1300&#160;nm electromagnetic spectrum of first biological window (&#955;max = 842&#160;nm) with a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of &#8764;2280 cm&#8722;1 (&#8764;167&#160;nm), and achieves a record EQE of 61.25% detected at 450&#160;nm excitation through Li&#8208;ion compensation. A prototype NIR pc&#8208;LED was fabricated with MT:Cr3+, Li+ to evaluate its potential practical application, which revealed a NIR output power of 53.22&#160;mW at a driving current of 100&#160;mA, and a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 25.09% at 10&#160;mA. This work provides an ultra&#8208;efficient broadband NIR luminescent material, which shows great promise in practical applications and presents a novel option for the next generation of high&#8208;power compact NIR light sources.

         <title>Interface Engineering for Highly Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have made dramatic advancements during the past decades owing to the innovative material design and device structure optimization, with power conversion efficiencies surpassing 19% and 20% for single&#8208;junction and tandem devices, respectively. Interface engineering, by modifying interface properties between different layers for OSCs, has become a vital part to promote the device efficiency. It is essential to elucidate the intrinsic working mechanism of interface layers, as well as the related physical and chemical processes that manipulate device performance and long&#8208;term stability. In this article, the advances in interface engineering aimed to pursue high&#8208;performance OSCs were reviewed. The specific functions and corresponding design principles of interface layers were summarized firstly. Then we discussed the anode interface layer (AIL), cathode interface layer (CIL) in single&#8208;junction OSCs, and interconnecting layer (ICL) of tandem devices in separate categories and analyzed the interface engineering&#8208;related improvements on device efficiency and stability. Finally, the challenges and prospects associated with application of interface engineering were discussed with the emphasis on large&#8208;area, high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;cost device manufacturing.

         <title>Superfast Mass Transport of Na/K Via Mesochannels for Dendrite&#8208;Free Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na/K plating&#8211;stripping behaviors in carbon hosts with mesochannels that enable superfast mass transport are systematically studied by in situ transmission electron microscopy. These mesochannels can remarkably increase the accessible surface area, thus boosting the surface ion diffusion, and then becoming the superfast channels for Na/K transport via interfacial diffusion. Such pore&#8208;modified hosts enable dendrite&#8208;free sodium deposition and superior high&#8208;rate performance.








Abstract
Fast ion diffusion in anode hosts enabling uniform distribution of Li/Na/K is essential for achieving dendrite&#8208;free alkali&#8208;metal batteries. Common strategies, e.g. expanding the interlayer spacing of anode materials, can enhance bulk diffusion of Li but are less efficient for Na and K due to their larger ionic radius. Herein, a universal strategy to drastically improve the mass&#8208;transport efficiency of Na/K by introducing open mesochannels in carbon hosts is proposed. Such pore engineering can increase the accessible surface area by one order of magnitude, thus remarkably accelerating surface diffusion, as visualized by in situ transmission electron microscopy. In particular, once the mesochannels are filled by the&#160;Na/K metals, they become the superfast channels for mass transport via the mechanism of interfacial diffusion. Thus&#8208;modified carbon hosts enable Na/K filling in their inner cavities and uniform deposition across the whole electrodes with fast kinetics. The resulting Na&#8208;metal anodes can exhibit stable dendrite&#8208;free cycling with outstanding rate performance at a high current density of up to 30&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This work presents an inspiring attempt to address the sluggish transport issue of Na/K, as well as valuable insights into the mass&#8208;transport mechanism in porous anodes for high&#8208;performance alkali&#8208;metal storage.

     alt="Superfast Mass Transport of Na/K Via Mesochannels for Dendrite-Free Metal Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na/K plating&#8211;stripping behaviors in carbon hosts with mesochannels that enable superfast mass transport are systematically studied by in situ transmission electron microscopy. These mesochannels can remarkably increase the accessible surface area, thus boosting the surface ion diffusion, and then becoming the superfast channels for Na/K transport via interfacial diffusion. Such pore-modified hosts enable dendrite-free sodium deposition and superior high-rate performance.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Planted Graphene Quantum Dots for Targeted, Enhanced Tumor Imaging and Long&#8208;Term Visualization of Local Pharmacokinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) are in situ planted in a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) layer of PEGylated nanoparticles from small&#8208;molecule pyrene. After accessible specificity modification, the multifunctional NPs&#8208;GQDs&#8208;PEG provides targeted, multimodal molecular imaging for various tumor models in vitro or in vivo. Moreover, the highly photostable GQDs enable long&#8208;term, real&#8208;time visualization of the local pharmacokinetics of NPs in vivo.








Abstract
While photoluminescent graphene quantum dots (GQDs) have long been considered very suitable for bioimaging owing to their protein&#8208;like size, superhigh photostability and in vivo long&#8208;term biosafety, their unique and crucial bioimaging applications in vivo remain unreachable. Herein, planted GQDs are presented as an excellent tool for in vivo fluorescent, sustainable and multimodality tumor bioimaging in various scenarios. The GQDs are in situ planted in the poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) layer of PEGylated nanoparticles via a bottom&#8208;up molecular approach to obtain the NPs&#8208;GQDs&#8208;PEG nanocomposite. The planted GQDs show more than four times prolonged blood circulation and 7&#8211;8 times increased tumor accumulation than typical GQDs in vivo. After accessible specificity modification, the multifunctional NPs&#8208;GQDs&#8208;PEG provides targeted, multimodal molecular imaging for various tumor models in vitro or in vivo. Moreover, the highly photostable GQDs enable long&#8208;term, real&#8208;time visualization of the local pharmacokinetics of NPs in vivo. Planting GQDs in PEGylated nanomedicine offers a new strategy for broad in vivo biomedical applications of GQDs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing, Reconfigurable, Thermal&#8208;Switching, Transformative Electronics for Health Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Printing solid&#8211;liquid biphasic liquid metal patterns on the hygroscopic hyperbranched polymer substrate demonstrates a self&#8208;healing, reconfigurable device platform with thermal&#8208;switching stiffness and adhesion. Triggered by the increased temperature, the device platform conforms and adheres to the textured skin or other 3D curvilinear surfaces can provide an integrated remote monitoring system for non&#8208;invasive, continuous, long&#8208;term health monitoring of people and structures.








Abstract
Soft, deformable electronic devices provide the means to monitor physiological information and health conditions for disease diagnostics. However, their practical utility is limited due to the lack of intrinsical thermal switching for mechanically transformative adaptability and self&#8208;healing capability against mechanical damages. Here, the design concepts, materials and physics, manufacturing approaches, and application opportunities of self&#8208;healing, reconfigurable, thermal&#8208;switching device platforms based on hyperbranched polymers and biphasic liquid metal are reported. The former provides excellent self&#8208;healing performance and unique tunable stiffness and adhesion regulated by temperature for the on&#8208;skin switch, whereas the latter results in liquid metal circuits with extreme stretchability (&gt;900%) and high conductivity (3.40&#160;&#215;&#160;104&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1), as well as simple recycling capability. Triggered by the increased temperature from the skin surface, a multifunctional device platform can conveniently conform and strongly adhere to the hierarchically textured skin surface for non&#8208;invasive, continuous, comfortable health monitoring. Additionally, the self&#8208;healing and adhesive characteristics allow multiple multifunctional circuit components to assemble and completely wrap on 3D curvilinear surfaces. Together, the design, manufacturing, and proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of the self&#8208;healing, transformative, and self&#8208;assembled electronics open up new opportunities for robust soft deformable devices, smart robotics, prosthetics, and Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things, and human&#8211;machine interfaces on irregular surfaces.

         <title>Small&#8208;Scale Robotics with Tailored Wettability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;scale robots (SSRs) have emerged as promising tools in a variety of biomedical, sensing, and decontamination applications. The review encompasses the basic understanding, theory, and up&#8208;to&#8208;date developments related to SSRs with tailored wettabilities, ranging from hydrophilic to hydrophobic.








Abstract
Small&#8208;scale robots (SSRs) have emerged as promising and versatile tools in various biomedical, sensing, decontamination, and manipulation applications, as they are uniquely capable of performing tasks at small length scales. With the miniaturization of robots from the macroscale to millimeter&#8208;, micrometer&#8208;, and nanometer&#8208;scales, the viscous and surface forces, namely adhesive forces and surface tension have become dominant. These forces significantly impact motion efficiency. Surface engineering of robots with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic functionalization presents a brand&#8208;new pathway to overcome motion resistance and enhance the ability to target and regulate robots for various tasks. This review focuses on the current progress and future perspectives of SSRs with hydrophilic and hydrophobic modifications (including both tethered and untethered robots). The study emphasizes the distinct advantages of SSRs, such as improved maneuverability and reduced drag forces, and outlines their potential applications. With continued innovation, rational surface engineering is expected to endow SSRs with exceptional mobility and functionality, which can broaden their applications, enhance their penetration depth, reduce surface fouling, and inhibit bacterial adhesion.

         <title>Unveiling Charge&#8208;Transport Mechanisms in Electronic Devices Based on Defect&#8208;Engineered MoS2 Covalent Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent networks of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) represent an efficient strategy to reduce the interflake junction resistance in thin&#8208;film devices. This multiscale investigation reveals that the molecular structure of the linker is crucial to control the overall charge&#8208;transport mechanisms. This work highlights the great potential of defect engineering for the fabrication of high&#8208;performance devices based on covalent TMD networks.








Abstract
Device performance of solution&#8208;processed 2D semiconductors in printed electronics has been limited so far by structural defects and high interflake junction resistance. Covalently interconnected networks of transition metal dichalcogenides potentially represent an efficient strategy to overcome both limitations simultaneously. Yet, the charge&#8208;transport properties in such systems have not been systematically researched. Here, the charge&#8208;transport mechanisms of printed devices based on covalent MoS2 networks are unveiled via multiscale analysis, comparing the effects of aromatic versus aliphatic dithiolated linkers. Temperature&#8208;dependent electrical measurements reveal hopping as the dominant transport mechanism: aliphatic systems lead to 3D variable range hopping, unlike the nearest neighbor hopping observed for aromatic linkers. The novel analysis based on percolation theory attributes the superior performance of devices functionalized with &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules to the improved interflake electronic connectivity and formation of additional percolation paths, as further corroborated by density functional calculations. Valuable guidelines for harnessing the charge&#8208;transport properties in MoS2 devices based on covalent networks are provided.

Abstract
Aligned submicron fibers have played an essential role in inducing stem cell proliferation and differentiation in tissue engineering. However, it remains challenging to fully understand and modify the differences between stem cell proliferation and differentiation on aligned&#8208;random fibers. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to identify the differential causes of stem cell proliferation and differentiation between BMSCs on aligned&#8208;random fibers with different elastic modulus, and to change the differential levels between them through a regulatory mechanism mediated by BCL&#8208;6 and miR&#8208;126&#8208;5p. The results showed that the most significant PIP2 alterations were found in the aligned fibers compared with the random fibers, which had a regular and oriented structure, excellent elastic modulus and cytocompatibility, regular cytoskeleton and movement pattern, high differentiation potential, and the most differentiated PIP2 gene. The same trend was actual for the aligned fibers with a lower elastic modulus. The level of proliferative differentiation genes in cells on random fibers and high elastic modulus aligned fibers was altered by BCL&#8208;6 and miR&#8208;126&#8208;5p mediated regulatory mechanisms to make the apparent cell distribution nearly consistent with the cell state on low elastic modulus aligned fibers. This work demonstrates the reason for the difference of cells between the two kinds of fibers and on fibers with different elastic modulus. It provides more insights for understanding the gene&#8208;level regulation of cell growth in tissue engineering. These findings will greatly help the application and design of 3D tissue culture for tissue engineering.

&lt;p&gt;Aligned submicron fibers have played an essential role in inducing stem cell proliferation and differentiation in tissue engineering. However, it remains challenging to fully understand and modify the differences between stem cell proliferation and differentiation on aligned-random fibers. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to identify the differential causes of stem cell proliferation and differentiation between BMSCs on aligned-random fibers with different elastic modulus, and to change the differential levels between them through a regulatory mechanism mediated by BCL-6 and miR-126-5p. The results showed that the most significant PIP2 alterations were found in the aligned fibers compared with the random fibers, which had a regular and oriented structure, excellent elastic modulus and cytocompatibility, regular cytoskeleton and movement pattern, high differentiation potential, and the most differentiated PIP2 gene.

         <title>Towards High Conversion Efficiency of Thermoelectric Modules Through Synergistical Optimization of Layered Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Waste&#8208;heat electricity generation using high&#8208;efficiency solid&#8208;state conversion technology can significantly decrease dependence on fossil fuels. In this paper, we report a synergistical optimization of layered half&#8208;Heusler (hH) materials and module to improve thermoelectric conversion efficiency. This was realized by manufacturing multiple thermoelectric materials with major compositional variations and temperature&#8208;gradient&#8208;coupled carrier distribution by one&#8208;step spark plasma sintering. This strategy provides a solution to overcome the intrinsic concomitants of the conventional segmented architecture that only considers the matching of the figure of merit (zT) with the temperature gradient. The current design is dedicated to temperature&#8208;gradient coupled resistivity and compatibility matching, optimum zT matching, and reducing contact resistance sources. By enhancing the quality factor of the materials by Sb&#8208;vapor pressure&#8208;induced annealing, a superior zT of 1.47 at 973 K was achieved for (Nb, Hf)FeSb hH alloys. Along with the low&#8208;temperature high&#8208;zT hH alloys of (Nb, Ta, Ti, V)FeSb, the single stage layered hH modules were developed with efficiencies of &#8764;15.2% and &#8764;13.5% for the single&#8208;leg and unicouple thermoelectric modules, respectively, under &#916;T of 670 K. Therefore, this work has a transformative impact on the design and development of next&#8208;generation thermoelectric generators for any thermoelectric materials families.

&lt;p&gt;Waste-heat electricity generation using high-efficiency solid-state conversion technology can significantly decrease dependence on fossil fuels. In this paper, we report a synergistical optimization of layered half-Heusler (hH) materials and module to improve thermoelectric conversion efficiency. This was realized by manufacturing multiple thermoelectric materials with major compositional variations and temperature-gradient-coupled carrier distribution by one-step spark plasma sintering. This strategy provides a solution to overcome the intrinsic concomitants of the conventional segmented architecture that only considers the matching of the figure of merit (&lt;i&gt;zT&lt;/i&gt;) with the temperature gradient. The current design is dedicated to temperature-gradient coupled resistivity and compatibility matching, optimum &lt;i&gt;zT&lt;/i&gt; matching, and reducing contact resistance sources.

         <title>Two Functions from a Single Photoresist: Tuning Microstructure Degradability from Light&#8208;Stabilized Dynamic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We introduce a photoresist &#8212; based on a light&#8208;stabilized dynamic material driven by an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium photo&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of triazolinediones with naphthalenes &#8212; whose ability to intrinsically degrade post&#8208;printing can be tuned by a simple adjustment of laser intensity during 3D laser lithography. Our resist's ability to form stable networks under green light irradiation that degrade in the dark was transformed into a tuneable degradable 3D printing materials platform. In&#8208;depth characterization of the printed microstructures via AFM before and during degradation revealed the high dependency of the final structures&#8217; properties on the writing parameters. Upon identifying the ideal writing parameters and their effect on the network structure, we are able to selectively toggle between stable and fully degradable structures simplifying the direct laser writing manufacturing process of multi&#8208;functional materials significantly, which typically requires the use of separate resists and consecutive writing efforts to achieve degradable and non&#8208;degradable material sections.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The interface tailoring is crucial for the efficiency and stability of Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs). The reported interface engineering primarily focuses on the energy level turning and trap states passivation to improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. In this review, we have classified molecule modifications according to the basics of electron transfer mechanisms for the interface tailoring of materials. An in&#8208;depth analysis of energy level modification and trap passivation, as well as the universal the Density Functional Theory (DFT) method employed in interface tailoring. In addition, strategies to address environmental protection and large&#8208;scale mini&#8208;modules fabrication by interface engineering are also discussed. This review will guide the researchers in understanding interface engineering to design interface materials for efficient, stable, and eco&#8208;friendly PSCs.

Various human&#8208;interactive sensing displays (HISDs) enabling facile detection of human information, followed by visualization of the information have been developed with innovative materials design and device architectures, making them suitable for emerging human&#8211;machine interface technologies including numerous biomedical and healthcare applications. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in emerging HISDs with their perspectives for future development.








Abstract
The development of human&#8208;interactive sensing displays (HISDs) that simultaneously detect and visualize stimuli is important for numerous cutting&#8208;edge human&#8211;machine interface technologies. Therefore, innovative device platforms with optimized architectures of HISDs combined with novel high&#8208;performance sensing and display materials are demonstrated. This study comprehensively reviews the recent advances in HISDs, particularly the device architectures that enable scaling&#8208;down and simplifying the HISD, as well as material designs capable of directly visualizing input information received by various sensors. Various HISD platforms for integrating sensors and displays are described. HISDs consist of a sensor and display connected through a microprocessor, and attempts to assemble the two devices by eliminating the microprocessor are detailed. Single&#8208;device HISD technologies are highlighted in which input stimuli acquired by sensory components are directly visualized with various optical components, such as electroluminescence, mechanoluminescence and structural color. The review forecasts future HISD technologies that demand the development of materials with molecular&#8208;level synthetic precision that enables simultaneous sensing and visualization. Furthermore, emerging HISDs combined with artificial intelligence technologies and those enabling simultaneous detection and visualization of extrasensory information are discussed.

         <title>Compute in&#8208;Memory with Non&#8208;Volatile Elements for Neural Networks: A Review from a Co&#8208;Design Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deep learning drives an increasing demand on compute resources. A key operation, matrix&#8208;vector&#8208;multiplication, can potentially be accelerated using cross&#8208;bar interconnects with nodal non&#8208;volatile memory. However, its application today is limited by the properties of the memory elements. Taking a co&#8208;design view, this review addresses the interdependencies of materials and architecture for such cross&#8208;bar hardware for training and inference.








Abstract
Deep learning has&#160;become ubiquitous, touching daily lives across the globe. Today, traditional computer architectures are stressed to their limits in efficiently executing the growing complexity of data and models. Compute&#8208;in&#8208;memory (CIM) can potentially play an important role in developing efficient hardware solutions that reduce data movement from compute&#8208;unit to memory, known as the von Neumann bottleneck. At its heart is a cross&#8208;bar architecture with nodal non&#8208;volatile&#8208;memory elements that performs an analog multiply&#8208;and&#8208;accumulate operation, enabling the matrix&#8208;vector&#8208;multiplications repeatedly used in all neural network workloads. The memory materials can significantly influence final system&#8208;level characteristics and chip performance, including speed, power, and classification accuracy. With an over&#8208;arching co&#8208;design viewpoint, this review assesses the use of cross&#8208;bar based CIM for neural networks, connecting the material properties and the associated design constraints and demands to application, architecture, and performance. Both digital and analog memory are considered, assessing the status for training and inference, and providing metrics for the collective set of properties non&#8208;volatile memory materials will need to demonstrate for a successful CIM technology.

         <title>Layered Metal Oxide Nanosheets with Enhanced Interlayer Space for Electrochemical Deionization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered metal oxide with enhanced interlayer spacing is synthesized and employed in electrochemical deionization, achieving high salt adsorption capacity&#160;and adsorption rate, and long&#8208;term cycling stability. The electro&#8208;sorption of layered metal oxides originates from the reconstruction of the layered structure based on the "memory effect".








Abstract
Electrochemical deionization is regarded as one of the promising water treatment technologies. Here, CoAl&#8208;layered metal oxide nanosheets intercalated by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) with an enhanced interlayer spacing from 0.76 to 1.33&#160;nm are synthesized and used as an anode. The enlarged interlayer spacing provides an enhanced ion&#8208;diffusion channel and improves the utilization of the interlayer electroactive sites, while heat treatment, transferring layered double hydroxides to layered metal oxides (LMOs), offers additional active oxidation reaction sites to facilitate the electro&#8208;sorption rate, contributing to the high salt adsorption capacity (31.78&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1) and average salt adsorption rate (3.75&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;min&#8722;1) at 1.2&#160;V in 500&#160;mg&#160;L&#8722;1 NaCl solution. In addition, the excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability (92.9%) after 40 cycles proves the strong electronic interaction between SDS and the host layer, which is validated by density functional theory calculations later on. Moreover, the electro&#8208;sorption mechanism of LMOs that originated from the reconstruction of the layered structure based on the &#8220;memory effect&#8221; is revealed according to the X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy peak shifts of Co element. This strategy of expanding the interlayer spacing combined with heat treatment makes LMOs a competitive candidate for electrochemical water deionization.

         <title>Probing the Mechanically Stable Solid Electrolyte Interphase and the Implications in Design Strategies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanically stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for realizing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. This review summarizes the desirable mechanical properties of SEI, mechanical characterization methods, and previous optimization attempts. Inconsistencies in these efforts are clarified and the causes are explored. A research protocol is proposed to accelerate the achievement of superior battery cycling performance by improving the mechanical stability of SEI.








Abstract
The inevitable volume expansion of secondary battery anodes during cycling imposes forces on the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The battery performance is closely related to the capability of SEI to maintain intact under the cyclic loading conditions, which basically boils down to the mechanical properties of SEI. The volatile and complex nature of SEI as well as its nanoscale thickness and environmental sensitivity make the interpretation of its mechanical behavior many roadblocks. Widely varied approaches are adopted to investigate the mechanical properties of SEI, and diverse opinions are generated. The lack of consensus at both technical and theoretical levels has hindered the development of effective design strategies to maximize the mechanical stability of SEIs. Here, the essential and desirable mechanical properties of SEI, the available mechanical characterization methods, and important issues meriting attention for higher test accuracy are outlined. Previous attempts to optimize battery performance by tuning SEI mechanical properties are also scrutinized, inconsistencies in these efforts are elucidated, and the underlying causes are explored. Finally, a set of research protocols is proposed to accelerate the achievement of superior battery cycling performance by improving the mechanical stability of SEI.

         <title>Dual Behavior Regulation: Tether&#8208;free Deep&#8208;brain Stimulation by Photothermal and Upconversion Hybrid Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Optogenetics has been plagued by invasive brain implants and thermal effects during photo&#8208;modulation. Here we demonstrate two upconversion hybrid nanoparticles modified with photothermal agents, named PT&#8208;UCNP&#8208;B/G, which can modulate neuronal activities via photostimulation and thermo&#8208;stimulation under near&#8208;infrared laser irradiation at 980&#160;nm and 808&#160;nm, respectively. PT&#8208;UCNP&#8208;B/G emits visible light (410&#8211;500&#160;nm or 500&#8211;570&#160;nm) through the upconversion process at 980&#160;nm, while they exhibit efficient photothermal effect at 808&#160;nm with no visible emission and tissue damage. Intriguingly, PT&#8208;UCNP&#8208;B significantly activates extracellular sodium currents in neuro2a (N2a) cells expressing light&#8208;gated channelrhodopsin&#8208;2 (ChR2) ion channels under 980&#8208;nm irradiation, and inhibits potassium currents in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells expressing the voltage&#8208;gated potassium channels (KCNQ1) under 808&#8208;nm irradiation in vitro. Furthermore, deep&#8208;brain bidirectional modulation of feeding behavior was achieved under tether&#8208;free 980&#8208;nm or 808&#8208;nm illumination (0.8&#160;W cm&#8722;2) in mice stereotactically injected with PT&#8208;UCNP&#8208;B in the ChR2&#8208;expressing lateral hypothalamus region. Thus, PT&#8208;UCNP&#8208;B/G creates new possibility of utilizing both light and heat to modulate neural activities and provides a viable strategy to overcome the limits of optogenetics.

         <title>Multi&#8208;targeted peptide&#8208;modified gold nanoclusters for treating solid tumors in the liver</title>

Abstract
Apoptosis and autophagy determine the fate of cancer cells. However, simply promoting apoptosis of tumor cells is limited in the treatment of unresectable solid liver tumors. Generally, autophagy is considered the anti&#8208;apoptotic &#8220;guardian&#8221;. But the pro&#8208;apoptotic effects of autophagy can be activated by excessive endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Here, we design amphiphilic peptide&#8208;modified glutathione (GSH)&#8208;gold nanocluster aggregates (AP1P2&#8208;PEG NCs) with the enrichment of solid liver tumors and the prolonged stress in the ER, which can achieve the mutual promotion of autophagy and apoptosis in liver tumor cells. In this study, orthotopic and subcutaneous liver tumor models show the anti&#8208;tumor effectiveness of AP1P2&#8208;PEG NCs, with a better antitumor effect than sorafenib, biosafety (LD50 of 827.3&#160;mg kg&#8722;1), wide therapeutic window (non&#8208;toxic in 20 times of therapeutic concentration) and high stability (blood half&#8208;life of 4&#160;h). These findings identify an effective strategy to develop peptide&#8208;modified gold nanocluster aggregates with low toxicity, high potency, and selectivity for solid liver tumors treatment.

         <title>Compromising Charge Generation and Recombination of Organic Photovoltaics with Mixed Diluents Strategy for Certified 19.4% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The ternary blend has been demonstrated an effective strategy to promote the device performance of organic photovoltaics (OPV) due to the dilution effect. While the compromise between the charge generation and recombination remains a challenge. Here, we proposed a mixed diluents strategy for further improving the device efficiency of OPV. Specifically, the high&#8208;performance OPV system with a polymer donor, i.e., PM6, and a non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA), i.e., BTP&#8208;eC9, is diluted by the mixed diluents, which involve a high band gap NFA of BTP&#8208;S17 and a low band gap NFA of BTP&#8208;S16 (similar with that of the BTP&#8208;eC9). The BTP&#8208;S17 of better miscibility with BTP&#8208;eC9 can dramatically enhance the open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC), while the BTP&#8208;S16 maximizes the charge generation or the short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC). The interplay of BTP&#8208;17 and BTP&#8208;S16 enables better compromise between charge generation and recombination, thus leading to a high device performance of 19.76% (certified 19.41%), which is the best among single&#8208;junction OPVs. Further analysis on carrier dynamics validates the efficacy of mixed diluents for balancing charge generation and recombination, which can be further attributed to the more diverse energetic landscapes and improved morphology. Therefore, this work provides an effective strategy for high&#8208;performance OPV for further commercialization.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;based Therapies for Inflammatory Diseases</title>

Abstract
Inflammatory diseases (IDs) are a general term that covers all diseases in which chronic inflammation perform as the major manifestation of pathogenesis. Traditional therapies based on the anti&#8208;inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs and are palliative with the short&#8208;term remission. The emerging of nanodrugs has been reported to solve the potential causes and prevent a recurrence, thus holding great potential for the treatment of IDs. Among various nanomaterial systems, transition metal&#8208;based smart nanosystems (TMSNs) with unique electronic structures possess therapeutic advantages owing to their large surface area to volume ratio (S/V ratio), high photothermal conversion efficiency, X&#8208;ray absorption capacity, and multiple catalytic enzyme activities. In this review, we will summarize the rationale, design principle and therapeutic mechanisms of TMSNs for treatments of various IDs. Specifically, TMSNs can not only be designed to scavenge danger signals, such as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) and cell&#8208;free DNA (cfDNA), but also can be engineered to block the mechanism of initiating inflammatory responses. In addition, TMSNs can be further applied as nanocarriers to deliver anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs. We conclude by discussing the opportunities and challenges of TMSNs, and emphasizing the future directions of TMSNs&#8208;based IDs treatment for clinical applications.

         <title>Micro&#8208;Scale Mechanical Metamaterial with a Controllable Transition in the Poisson's Ratio and Band Gap Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The ability to significantly change the mechanical and wave propagation properties of a structure without rebuilding it is currently one of the main challenges in the field of mechanical metamaterials. This stems from the enormous appeal that such tunable behavior may offer from the perspective of applications ranging from biomedical to protective devices, particularly in the case of micro&#8208;scale systems. In this work, a novel micro&#8208;scale mechanical metamaterial is proposed that can undergo a transition from one type of configuration to another, with one configuration having a very negative Poisson's ratio, corresponding to strong auxeticity, and the other having a highly positive Poisson's ratio. The formation of phononic band gaps can also be controlled concurrently which can be very useful for the design of vibration dampers and sensors. Finally, it is experimentally shown that the reconfiguration process can be induced and controlled remotely through application of a magnetic field by using appropriately distributed magnetic inclusions.

         <title>Efficient inorganic vapor&#8208;assisted defects passivation for perovskite solar module</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Surface trap as intrinsic defects&#8208;mediated non&#8208;radiative charge recombination is a major obstacle to achieving the reliable fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency and large&#8208;area perovskite photovoltaics. Here we propose a CS2 vapor&#8208;assisted passivation strategy for perovskite solar module (PSM), aiming to passivate the iodine vacancy and uncoordinated Pb2+ caused by ion migration. Significantly, this method can avoid the disadvantages of inhomogeneity film caused by spin&#8208;coating&#8208;assisted passivation and reconstruction of perovskite surface from solvent. The CS2 vapor passivated perovskite device presents the higher defect formation energy (0.54&#160;eV) of iodine vacancy than the pristine (0.37&#160;eV), while uncoordinated Pb2+ has been bonded with CS2. The shallow level defect passivation of iodine vacancy and uncoordinated Pb2+ has obviously enhanced the device efficiencies (25.20% for 0.08 cm2 and 20.66% for 40.6 cm2) and the stability, exhibiting an average T80&#8208;lifetime of 1040&#160;h working at the maximum power point, and maintaining over 90% of initial efficiency after 2000&#160;h at RH = 30% and 30 &#176;C.

         <title>Room&#8208;temperature Intrinsic Ferromagnetic Chromium Tellurium Compounds with Thickness&#8208;tunable Magnetic Texture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic chromium tellurides exhibit intriguing spin configurations and high&#8208;temperature intrinsic ferromagnetism, providing unprecedented opportunities to explore the fundamental spin physics and build spintronic devices. Here, we developed a generic van der Waals epitaxial approach to synthesize the 2D ternary chromium tellurium compounds with thicknesses down to mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and few&#8208;unit cell (UCs). The Mn0.14Cr0.86Te evolves from intrinsic ferromagnetic behavior in bi&#8208;UC, tri&#8208;UC, and few&#8208; UC to temperature&#8208;induced ferrimagnetic behavior as the thickness increases, resulting in a sign reversal of the anomalous Hall resistance. Temperature&#8208; and thickness&#8208;tunable labyrinthine&#8208;domain ferromagnetic behaviors were derived from the dipolar interactions in Fe0.26Cr0.74Te and Co0.40Cr0.60Te. Furthermore, the dipolar&#8208;interaction&#8208;induced stripe domain and field&#8208;induced domain wall motion (DW) velocity were studied, and multibit data storage was realized through an abundant DW state. The magnetic storage can function in neuromorphic computing tasks, and the pattern recognition accuracy can reach up to 97.93%, which is similar to the recognition accuracy of ideal software&#8208;based training (98.28%). Room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic chromium tellurium compounds with intriguing spin configurations can significantly promote the exploration of the processing, sensing, and storage based on 2D magnetic systems.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Industrial&#8208;Grade p&#8208;Type (Bi,Sb)2Te3 Thermoelectric Enabled by a Stepwise Optimization Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
As the sole dominator of the commercial thermoelectric (TE) market, Bi2Te3&#8208;based alloys play an irreplaceable role in Peltier cooling and low&#8208;grade waste heat recovery. At present, the main barrier to a wider application is the relatively low efficiency determined by the low&#8208;rise TE figure of merit ZT. Herein, an effective approach is reported for improving the TE performance of p&#8208;type (Bi,Sb)2Te3 by incorporating Ag8GeTe6 and Se. Specifically, the diffused Ag and Ge atoms into the matrix conduce to optimized carrier concentration and enlarged the density of states effective mass while the Sb&#8208;rich nanoprecipitates generate coherent interfaces with little loss of carrier mobility. The subsequent Se dopants introduce multiple phonon scattering sources and significantly suppress the lattice thermal conductivity while maintaining a decent power factor. Consequently, a high peak ZT of 1.53 at 350 K and a remarkable average ZT of 1.31 (300&#8722;500 K) are attained in the Bi0.4Sb1.6Te0.95Se0.05 + 0.10 wt% Ag8GeTe6 sample. Most noteworthily, the size and mass of the optimal sample have been enlarged to &#216;40 mm&#8208;200&#160;g and the constructed 17&#8208;couple TE module exhibits an extraordinary conversion efficiency &#951; of 6.3% at &#916;T = 245 K. This work demonstrates a facile method to develop high&#8208;performance and industrial&#8208;grade (Bi,Sb)2Te3&#8208;based alloys, which paves a strong way for the further practical applications.

         <title>Integrating Mixed Halide Perovskite Photocatalytic HI Splitting and Electrocatalysis into a Loop for Efficient and Robust Pure Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Developing a hydrogen economy to replace traditional fossil fuels is essential for sustainable human development. As two promising H2 production strategies, photocatalytic and electrocatalytic water splitting with large reaction energy barriers still face the great challenges of poor solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency and large electrochemical overpotentials, respectively.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing a hydrogen economy to replace traditional fossil fuels is essential for sustainable human development. As two promising H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production strategies, photocatalytic and electrocatalytic water splitting with large reaction energy barriers still face the great challenges of poor solar-to-hydrogen efficiency and large electrochemical overpotentials, respectively. Herein, a new strategy is proposed to disassemble the difficult pure water splitting into two parts that are easy to implement, namely mixed halide perovskite photocatalytic HI splitting for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production, and simultaneous electrocatalytic I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; reduction and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. The efficient charge separation, abundant H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production active sites, and a small HI splitting energy barrier contribute to the superior photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production activity of MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/MAPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3-x&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;. Subsequent electrocatalytic I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; reduction and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production reactions only need a small voltage of 0.92&#160;V to drive, which is far lower than that of the electrocatalytic pure water splitting (&amp;gt; 1.23&#160;V). The molar ratio of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (6.99&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) to O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (3.09&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) produced during the first photocatalytic and electrocatalytic cycle is close to 2:1, and the continuous circulation of I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Restoration of Sinusoid Fenestrae followed by Targeted Nanoassembly Delivery of an Anti&#8208;Fibrotic Agent Improves Treatment Efficacy in Liver Fibrosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
During the onset of liver fibrosis, capillarized liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) limit substance exchange between the blood and the Disse space, further accelerating hepatic stellate cell (HSCs) activation and fibrosis progression. Limited accessibility of therapeutics to the Disse space is often overlooked and remains a major bottleneck for HSCs&#8208;targeted therapy in liver fibrosis. Here, we report an integrated systemic strategy for liver fibrosis treatment, utilizing pretreatment with the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, riociguat, followed by insulin growth factor 2 receptor&#8208;mediated targeted delivery of the anti&#8208;fibrosis agent, JQ1, via peptide&#8208;nanoparticles (IGNP&#8208;JQ1). The riociguat reversed the liver sinusoid capillarization to maintain a relatively normal LSECs porosity, thus facilitating the transport of IGNP&#8208;JQ1 through the liver sinusoid endothelium wall and enhancing the accumulation of IGNP&#8208;JQ1 in the Disse space. IGNP&#8208;JQ1 was then selectively taken up by activated HSCs, inhibiting their proliferation and decreasing collagen deposition in the liver. The combined strategy resulted in significant fibrosis resolution in carbon tetrachloride&#8208;induced fibrotic mice as well as methionine&#8208;choline&#8208;deficient diet&#8208;induced non&#8208;alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) mice. Our work highlights the key role of LSECs in therapeutics transport through the liver sinusoid. The strategy of restoring LSECs fenestrae by riociguat represents a promising approach for liver fibrosis treatment.

         <title>A Scalable Platform for Fabricating Biodegradable Microparticles with Pulsatile Drug Release</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Pulsatile drug delivery systems have the potential to improve patient adherence and therapeutic efficacy by providing a sequence of doses in a single injection. Herein, we develop a novel platform, termed Particles Uniformly Liquified and Sealed to Encapsulate Drugs (PULSED), which enables the high&#8208;throughput fabrication of microparticles exhibiting pulsatile release. In PULSED, biodegradable polymeric microstructures with an open cavity are formed using high&#8208;resolution 3D printing and soft lithography, filled with drug, and sealed using a contactless heating step in which the polymer flows over the orifice to form a complete shell around a drug&#8208;loaded core. Poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) particles with this structure can rapidly release encapsulated material after delays of 10&#177;1, 15&#177;1, 17&#177;2, or 36&#177;1 days in vivo, depending on polymer molecular weight and end group. The system is even compatible with biologics, releasing over 90% of bevacizumab in its bioactive form after a two&#8208;week delay in vitro. The PULSED system is highly versatile, offering compatibility with crystalline and amorphous polymers, easily injectable particle sizes, and compatibility with several newly developed drug loading methods. Together, these results suggest that PULSED is a promising platform for creating long&#8208;acting drug formulations that improve patient outcomes due to its simplicity, low cost, and scalability.

         <title>Nonepitaxial electrodeposition of (002)&#8208;textured Zn anode on textureless substrates for dendrite&#8208;free and hydrogen evolution&#8208;suppressed Zn batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nontoxic and safe aqueous Zn batteries are largely restricted by the detrimental dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution of Zn metal anode. The (002)&#8208;textured Zn electrodeposition, demonstrated as effective approach for solving these issues, is nevertheless achieved mainly by epitaxial or hetero&#8208;epitaxial deposition of Zn on pre&#8208;textured substrates. Herein, we report the electrodeposition of (002)&#8208;textured and compact Zn on textureless substrates (commercial Zn, Cu and Ti foils) at a medium high galvanostatic current density. According to the systematic investigations on Zn nucleation and growth behaviors, this is ascribed to two reasons: (i) the promoted nonepitaxial nucleation of fine horizontal (002) nuclei at increased overpotential and (ii) the competitive growth advantages of (002)&#8208;orientated nuclei. The resulting freestanding (002)&#8208;textured Zn film exhibits significantly suppressed hydrogen evolution and prolonged Zn plating/stripping cycling life, achieving over 2100 mAh cm&#8722;2 cumulative capacity under a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a high depth of discharge (DOD) of 45.5%. Therefore, this study provides both fundamental and practical insights for long&#8208;life Zn metal batteries.

         <title>Unraveling the Plasma Protein Corona by Ultrasonic Cavitation Augments Active&#8208;Transporting of Liposome in Solid Tumor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transcytosis&#8208;targeting peptide&#8208;decorated reconfigurable liposome (LPGL) is capable of ultrasound&#8208;induced liposomal reassembly and protein&#8208;corona decortication. Ultrasound irradiation induces size&#8208;transformation of the LPGL and decorticates the surface protein corona by lipid membrane reassembly, whereby the capability to recognize the receptors on tumor neovascularization is regained, ligand/receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis is initiated, and efficient tumor accumulation and penetration is achieved, leading to potent antitumor activity.








Abstract
Ligand/receptor&#8208;mediated targeted drug delivery has been widely recognized as a promising strategy for improving the clinical efficacy of&#160;nanomedicines but is attenuated by the binding of plasma protein on the surface of nanoparticles to form a protein corona. Here, it is shown that ultrasonic cavitation can be used to unravel surface plasma coronas on liposomal nanoparticles through ultrasound (US)&#8208;induced liposomal reassembly. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the method, transcytosis&#8208;targeting&#8208;peptide&#8208;decorated reconfigurable liposomes (LPGLs) loaded with gemcitabine (GEM) and perfluoropentane (PFP) are developed for cancer&#8208;targeted therapy. In the blood circulation, the targeting peptides are deactivated by the plasma corona and lose their targeting capability. Once they reach tumor blood vessels, US irradiation induces transformation of the LPGLs from nanodrops into microbubbles via liquid&#8211;gas phase transition and decorticate the surface corona by reassembly of the lipid membrane. The activated liposomes regain the capability to recognize the receptors on tumor neovascularization, initiate ligand/receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis, achieve efficient tumor accumulation and penetration, and lead to potent antitumor activity in multiple tumor models of patient&#8208;derived tumor xenografts. This study presents an effective strategy to tackle the fluid biological barriers of the protein corona and develop transcytosis&#8208;targeting liposomes for active tumor transport and efficient cancer therapy.

&lt;p&gt;A transcytosis-targeting peptide-decorated reconfigurable liposome (LPGL) is capable of ultrasound-induced liposomal reassembly and protein-corona decortication. Ultrasound irradiation induces size-transformation of the LPGL and decorticates the surface protein corona by lipid membrane reassembly, whereby the capability to recognize the receptors on tumor neovascularization is regained, ligand/receptor-mediated transcytosis is initiated, and efficient tumor accumulation and penetration is achieved, leading to potent antitumor activity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ligand/receptor-mediated targeted drug delivery has been widely recognized as a promising strategy for improving the clinical efficacy of&#160;nanomedicines but is attenuated by the binding of plasma protein on the surface of nanoparticles to form a protein corona. Here, it is shown that ultrasonic cavitation can be used to unravel surface plasma coronas on liposomal nanoparticles through ultrasound (US)-induced liposomal reassembly. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the method, transcytosis-targeting-peptide-decorated reconfigurable liposomes (LPGLs) loaded with gemcitabine (GEM) and perfluoropentane (PFP) are developed for cancer-targeted therapy. In the blood circulation, the targeting peptides are deactivated by the plasma corona and lose their targeting capability. Once they reach tumor blood vessels, US irradiation induces transformation of the LPGLs from nanodrops into microbubbles via liquid&#8211;gas phase transition and decorticate the surface corona by reassembly of the lipid membrane. The activated liposomes regain the capability to recognize the receptors on tumor neovascularization, initiate ligand/receptor-mediated transcytosis, achieve efficient tumor accumulation and penetration, and lead to potent antitumor activity in multiple tumor models of patient-derived tumor xenografts. This study presents an effective strategy to tackle the fluid biological barriers of the protein corona and develop transcytosis-targeting liposomes for active tumor transport and efficient cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Realizing Highly Efficient Sonodynamic Bactericidal Capability through the Phonon&#8211;Electron Coupling Effect Using Two&#8208;Dimensional Catalytic Planar Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D catalytic planar defects have been rationally designed and engineered for reversing the ultrasonic silence of Ti3C2, dramatically realizing the highly efficient sonodynamic bactericidal therapy. It is unveiled that the electron's origin, electron transfer, and the visible O2&#160;activation pathway triggered by ultrasound are attributed to the phonon&#8211;electron coupling effect.








Abstract
Conferring catalytic defects in sonosensitizers is of paramount importance in reinforcing sonodynamic therapy. However, the formation of such 0D defects is governed by the Schottky defect principle. Herein, 2D catalytic planar defects are designed within Ti3C2&#160;sheets to address this challenge. These specific planar slip dislocations with abundant Ti3+ species (Ti3C2&#8208;SD(Ti3+)) can yield surface&#8208;bound O due to the effective activation of O2, thus resulting in a substantial amount of 1O2&#160;generation and the 99.72%&#160;&#177;&#160;0.03% bactericidal capability subject to ultrasound (US) stimulation. It is discovered that the 2D catalytic planar defects can intervene in electron transfer through the phonon drag effect&#8212;a coupling effect between surface electrons and US&#8208;triggered phonons&#8212;that simultaneously contributes to a dramatic decrease in O2&#160;activation energy from 1.65&#160;to 0.06&#160;eV. This design has achieved a qualitative leap in which the US catalytic site has transformed from 0D to 2D. Moreover, it is revealed that the electron origin, electron transfer, and visible O2&#160;activation pathway triggered by US can be attributed to the phonon&#8211;electron coupling effect. After coating with neutrophil membrane (NM) proteins, the NM&#8208;Ti3C2&#8208;SD(Ti3+) sheets further demonstrate a 6&#8208;log10&#160;reduction in methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus burden in the infected bony tissue.

         <title>Highly Stretchable and Biocompatible Wrinkled Nanoclay&#8208;Composite Hydrogel With Enhanced Sensing Capability for Precise Detection of Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel bioinspired nanoclay&#8208;composite wrinkled hydrogel sensor is developed with excellent mechanical and biocompatible properties and high and reliable sensing capacity due to the structural&#8211;mechanical&#8211;electrical integrity of the wrinkle micropattern and nanoclay&#8208;reinforced interpenetrating crosslinked network. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, this hydrogel sensor can accurately localize the region where myocardial infarction occurs, showing promise for real&#8208;time monitoring of pathological heart tissue.








Abstract
It is challenging to balance high biocompability with good mechanical&#8211;electrical sensing performance, especially when triggering inflammatory stress response after in vivo implantation. Herein, a bioinspired wrinkle&#8208;reinforced adaptive nanoclay&#8208;interlocked soft strain&#8208;sensor based on a highly stretchable and elastic ionic&#8208;conductive hydrogel is reported. This novel nanoclay&#8208;composite hydrogel exhibits excellent tensile properties and high sensing capacity with steady and reliable sensing performance due to the structural&#8211;mechanical&#8211;electrical integrity of the nanoclay crosslinked and nano&#8208;reinforced interpenetrating network. The incorporation of amphiphilic ions provides the hydrogel with significant protein resistance, reducing its non&#8208;specific adsorption to proteins upon implantation, improving its biosafety as an implanted device, and maintaining the authenticity of the sensing results. Based on the revealed sensing enhanced mechanism based on hierarchical ordered structures as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, this hydrogel sensor is demonstrated to be able to&#160;accurately localize the region where myocardial infarction occurs and may become a novel strategy for real&#8208;time monitoring of pathological changes in heart disease.

         <title>Synergistic Surface Modification of Tin&#8211;Lead Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>

Synergistic surface modification of mixed Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite films by the combination of piperazine and C60 pyrrolidine tris&#8208;acid realizes narrow&#8208;bandgap solar cells with power conversion efficiencies up to 22.7% and substantially elongated stability.








Abstract
Interfaces in thin&#8208;film photovoltaics play a pivotal role in determining device efficiency and longevity. In this work, the top surface treatment of mixed tin&#8211;lead (&#8776;1.26&#160;eV) halide perovskite films for p&#8211;i&#8211;n solar cells is studied. Charge extraction is promoted by treating the perovskite surface with piperazine. This compound reacts with the organic cations at the perovskite surface, modifying the surface structure and tuning the interfacial energy level alignment. In addition, the combined treatment with C60 pyrrolidine tris&#8208;acid (CPTA) reduces hysteresis and leads to efficiencies up to 22.7%, with open&#8208;circuit voltage values reaching 0.90&#160;V, &#8776;92% of the radiative limit for the bandgap of this material. The modified cells also show superior stability, with unencapsulated cells retaining 96% of their initial efficiency after &gt;2000 h of storage in N2 and encapsulated cells retaining 90% efficiency after &gt;450 h of storage in air. Intriguingly, CPTA preferentially binds to Sn2+ sites at film surface over Pb2+ due to the energetically favored exposure of the former, according to first&#8208;principles calculations. This work provides new insights into the surface chemistry of perovskite films in terms of their structural, electronic, and defect characteristics and this knowledge is used to fabricate state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art solar cells.

         <title>Magnetic Skyrmion Transistor Gated with Voltage&#8208;Controlled Magnetic Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment of a magnetic skyrmion transistor is presented using spatially uniform voltage&#8208;controlled magnetic anisotropy. A gate operation can control the translational motion of a magnetic skyrmion. Utilizing the gate&#8208;controlled skyrmion motion technique, the authors expect various skyrmion logic devices to be demonstrated in the future.








Abstract
The paradigm shift of information carriers from charge to spin has long been awaited in modern electronics. The invention of the spin&#8208;information transistor is expected to be an essential building block for the future development of spintronics. Here, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment of a magnetic skyrmion transistor working at room temperature, which has never been demonstrated experimentally, is introduced. With the spatially uniform control of magnetic anisotropy, the shape and topology of a skyrmion when passing the controlled area can be maintained. The findings will open a new route toward the design and realization of skyrmion&#8208;based spintronic devices in the near future.

         <dc:description>
By synthesizing a high weight&#8208;average molecular weight polymer donor PBDB&#8208;TF and combining a ternary blending strategy, favorable phase separation morphology featuring more compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance can be attained. A maximum power conversion efficiency of 18.2% (certified value of 17.7%) with excellent mechanical properties in all&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaic cells is demonstrated.








Abstract
All&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells possessing high photovoltaic performance and mechanical robustness are promising candidates for flexible wearable devices. However, developing photoactive materials with good mechanical properties and photovoltaic performance so far remains challenging. In this work, a polymer donor PBDB&#8208;TF with a high weight&#8208;average molecular weight (Mw) is introduced to enable highly efficient all&#8208;polymer OPV cells featuring excellent mechanical reliability. By incorporating the high&#8208;Mw PBDB&#8208;TF as a third component into the PBQx&#8208;TF:PY&#8208;IT blend, the bulk heterojunction morphology is finely tuned with a more compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance, affording efficient pathways for charge transport as well as mechanical stress dissipation. Hence, all&#8208;polymer OPV cells based on the ternary blend film demonstrate a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.2% with an outstanding fill factor of 0.796. The flexible OPV cell delivers a decent PCE of 16.5% with high mechanical stability. These results present a promising strategy to address the mechanical properties and boost the photovoltaic performance of all&#8208;polymer OPV cells.

         <title>Engineered Switchable&#8208;Wettability Surfaces for Multi&#8208;Path Directional Transportation of Droplets and Subaqueous Bubbles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D dumbbell&#8208;patterned functional surface featured by switchable wettability is proposed to achieve the multi&#8208;path parallel directional transportation of both water droplets and subaqueous bubbles. This programmable, easy&#8208;fabricable, highly&#8208;efficient, and cost&#8208;effective fluidic system with strong robustness against structural defects is ready for versatile fluid transportation supporting both liquid&#8208; and gas&#8208;phase matters.








Abstract
Conventional engineered surfaces for fluid manipulation are hindered by the set wettability, and thus they can only achieve spontaneous transport of single&#8208;phase fluid, namely liquid or gas. Moreover, fluid transport systems that are robust to path defects have yet to be fully explored. Here, unprecedentedly, a universal wettability switching strategy is developed for achieving programmable directional transport of both droplets and subaqueous bubbles on a dumbbell&#8208;patterned functional surface (DPFS), featuring in strong robustness, high efficiency, and effective cost. By tuning the superwettability of DPFS through octadecyltrichlorosilane treatment and ultraviolet&#8208;C selective irradiation, the transport fluid can alternate between liquid and gas. The material's switchable superwettability regulates the fluid directed dynamics within the confined pattern, in which the sustaining fluid propelling relies on the surface energy difference between the starting and terminal sites. This enables the construction of multiple channels, which works synergistically with ultralow&#8208;volume&#8208;loss transport to impart the fluidic system with strong robustness against path defects. Underlying the completion of complex microfluidics tasks, spatially&#8208;selective cooling devices and subaqueous gas microreactors are successfully demonstrated. This energy&#8208;consumption&#8208;free fluid transport system opens a new avenue for on&#8208;chip programmable fluid manipulation, promoting innovative applications requiring rational control of two&#8208;phase fluid transport.

         <title>Efficient Red Light Emitting Diodes Based on a Zero&#8208;Dimensional Organic Antimony Halide Hybrid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly luminescent zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic antimony bromide hybrid containing semiconducting organic cation is developed for the first time, with which electrically driven red light emitting diodes (LEDs) are fabricated to exhibit an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.12%, a peak luminance of 5957&#160;cd m&#8722;2, and a current efficiency of 14.2 cd A&#8722;1.








Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs) have recently emerged as a new class of light emitting materials with exceptional color tunability. While near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum efficiencies (PLQEs) are routinely obtained for a large number of 0D OMHHs, it remains challenging to apply them as emitter for electrically driven light emitting diodes (LEDs), largely due to the low conductivity of wide bandgap organic cations. Here, the development of a new OMHH, triphenyl(9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl) phosphonium antimony bromide (TPPcarzSbBr4), as emitter for efficient LEDs, which consists of semiconducting organic cations (TPPcarz+) and light emitting antimony bromide anions (Sb2Br82&#8722;), is reported. By replacing one of the phenyl groups in a well&#8208;known tetraphenylphosphonium cation (TPP+) with an electroactive phenylcarbazole group, a semiconducting TPPcarz+ cation is developed for the preparation of red emitting 0D TPPcarzSbBr4 single crystals with a high PLQE of 93.8%. With solution processed TPPcarzSbBr4 thin films (PLQE of 86.1%) as light emitting layer, red LEDs are fabricated to exhibit an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.12%, a peak luminance of 5957&#160;cd m&#8722;2, and a current efficiency of 14.2&#160;cd A&#8722;1, which are the best values reported to date for electroluminescence devices based on 0D OMHHs.

         <title>Construction of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Films via Crosslinking&#8208;Induced Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small clusters in the early growth steps of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can be stabilized by modulators to form fluidic precursors (denoted as preMOFs) with good processibility. Then, the removal of solvents and modulators will trigger the crosslinking of preMOFs and lead to the formation of continuous MOF films.








Abstract
The construction of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films is a crucial step for integrating them into technical applications. However, due to the crystallization nature, it is difficult to grow most MOFs spontaneously or process them into films. Here, a convenient strategy is demonstrated for constructing MOF films by using modulators to achieve homogeneous assembly of MOF clusters. Small clusters in the early growth steps of MOFs can be stabilized by modulators to form fluidic precursors with good processibility. Then, simple removal of modulators will trigger the crosslinking of MOF clusters and lead to the formation of continuous films. This strategy is universal for the fabrication of several types of MOF films with large scale and controllable thickness, which can be deposited on a variety of substrates as well as can be patterned in micro/nano resolution. Additionally, versatile composite MOF films can be easily synthesized by introducing functional materials during the crosslinking process, which brings them broader application prospects.

         <title>Microscale Combinatorial Libraries for the Discovery of High&#8208;Entropy Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microscale combinatorial libraries are introduced as a new method for exploration of polyelemental material systems. Composition gradients of quinary material systems are produced and characterized for crystal properties and electrocatalytic activity. The small dimensions of microscale combinatorial libraries enable efficient screening of thousands of compositions. Highly active electrocatalysts are identified in the systems Ru&#8211;Rh&#8211;Pd&#8211;Ir&#8211;Pt and Co&#8211;Ni&#8211;Mo&#8211;Pd&#8211;Pt.








Abstract
Polyelemental material systems, specifically high&#8208;entropy alloys, promise unprecedented properties. Due to almost unlimited combinatorial possibilities, their exploration and exploitation is hard. This challenge is addressed by co&#8208;sputtering combined with shadow masking to produce a multitude of microscale combinatorial libraries in one deposition process. These thin&#8208;film composition spreads on the microscale cover unprecedented compositional ranges of high&#8208;entropy alloy systems and enable high&#8208;throughput characterization of thousands of compositions for electrocatalytic energy conversion reactions using nanoscale scanning electrochemical cell microscopy. The exemplary exploration of the composition space of two high&#8208;entropy alloy systems provides electrocatalytic activity maps for hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution as well as oxygen reduction reactions. Activity optima in the system Ru&#8211;Rh&#8211;Pd&#8211;Ir&#8211;Pt are identified, and active noble&#8208;metal lean compositions in the system Co&#8211;Ni&#8211;Mo&#8211;Pd&#8211;Pt are discovered. This illustrates that the proposed microlibraries are a holistic discovery platform to master the multidimensionality challenge of polyelemental systems.

         <title>Unusual Spectrally Reproducible and High Q&#8208;Factor Random Lasing in Polycrystalline Tin Perovskite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly spectrally reproducible multimode random lasing is observed in thin polycrystalline films of tin iodide perovskite that cannot be explained by a strong mode localization. The observed spectral reproducibility can be due to the strong inhomogeneous broadening of photoluminescence spectra measured in tin&#8208;based perovskites on the basis of a comparison with an analogous Pb&#8208;based counterpart.








Abstract
An unusual spectrally reproducible near&#8208;IR random lasing (RL) with no fluctuation of lasing peak wavelength is disclosed in polycrystalline films of formamidinium tin triiodide perovskite, which have been chemically stabilized against Sn2+ to Sn4+ oxidation. Remarkably, a quality Q&#8208;factor as high as &#8776;104 with an amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) threshold as low as 2&#160;&#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2 (both at 20&#160;K) are achieved. The observed spectral reproducibility is unprecedented for semiconductor thin film RL systems and cannot be explained by the strong spatial localization of lasing modes. Instead, it is suggested that the spectral stability is a result of such an unique property of Sn&#8208;based perovskites as a large inhomogeneous broadening of the emitting centers, which is a consequence of an intrinsic structural inhomogeneity of the material. Due to this, lasing can occur simultaneously in modes that are spatially strongly overlapped, as long as the spectral separation between the modes is larger than the homogeneous linewidth of the emitting centers. The discovered mechanism of RL spectral stability in semiconductor materials, possessing inhomogeneous broadening, opens up prospects for their practical use as cheap sources of narrow laser lines.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Organohydrogel Artificial Muscle with Compartmentalized Anisotropic Actuation Under Microdomain Confinement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organohydrogel actuator achieving the combination of high speed, high actuation strength, and large material size is proposed. The water is confined in hydrophobic microdomains in organohydrogel, thus realizing a compartmentalization actuation mode similar to muscle. This strategy can break through the limitations that originated from the traditional solvent diffusion actuation mechanism, inspiring gel actuator design.








Abstract
Current hydrogel actuators mostly suffer from weak actuation strength and low responsive speed owing to their solvent diffusion&#8208;induced volume change mechanism. Here a skeletal muscle&#8208;inspired organohydrogel actuator is reported in which solvents are confined in hydrophobic microdomains. Organohydrogel actuator is driven by compartmentalized directional network deformation instead of volume change, avoiding the limitations that originate from solvent diffusion. Organohydrogel actuator has an actuation frequency of 0.11&#160;Hz, 110 times that of traditional solvent diffusion&#8208;driven hydrogel actuators (&lt;10&#8722;3&#160;Hz), and can lift more than 85 times their own weight. This design achieves the combination of high responsive speed, high actuation strength, and large material size, proposing a strategy to fabricate hydrogel actuators comparable with skeletal muscle performance.

         <title>Direct Conversion of Liquid Organic Precursor into 3D Laser&#8208;Induced Graphene Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A goal in graphene synthesis is to establish routes for preparing graphene materials from liquids instead of conventional solid or gaseous sources. This work reports the production of graphene materials with tunable composition directly from liquid precursor. A fundamentally new graphene 3D&#8208;printing system is further developed for constructing 3D graphene materials with high structural integrity unachievable by traditional printing strategy.








Abstract
Among the different states of matter, liquids have particular advantages in terms of easy handling and recycling, which has been manifested in various chemosynthetic reactions, but remains underexplored in graphene synthesis. This work reports the direct conversion of liquid organic precursor into versatile 3D graphene materials using rapid laser irradiation. The liquid precursor allows for easy fabrication of graphene with significant 3D architectures, including powders, patterned composite structures, and substrate&#8208;free films. Taking advantage of the high compatibility of liquid precursor with a wide range of dopants, the 3D graphene can be further engineered together with various functional components, especially the high loading (&#8776;15 wt.%) and well&#8208;dispersed (an average diameter of less than 50&#160;nm) high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles. Furthermore, combined with the 3D printing strategy, the rapid construction of graphene with complex and accurate 3D shapes is demonstrated via a selective in situ laser transforming (SLT) strategy. With the high structural integrity unachievable by traditional 3D printing methods, the obtained objects show an electrical conductivity of 4380 S&#160;m&#8722;1 and a compressive modulus of 31.8&#160;MPa. The results reported in this work will open up a new way for the fabrication of functional carbon materials with customizable shapes and components.

         <title>Bioengineering of High Cell Density Tissues with Hierarchical Vascular Networks for Ex Vivo Whole Organs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method is shown to fabricate an in vitro model of millimeter&#8208;sized scaffold&#8208;free tissues whose cell density is &#8776;200 million cells mL&#8722;1, corresponding to those of native tissues. The supply of oxygen and nutrition is extremely significant for such tissues. Therefore, a hierarchical vascular network containing capillaries and an artificial channel for perfusion are formed.








Abstract
The development of tissue&#8208;like structures such as cell sheets, spheroids, and organoids has contributed to progress in regenerative medicine. Simultaneous achievement of scale up and high cell density of these tissues is challenging because sufficient oxygen cannot be supplied to the inside of large, high cell density tissues. Here, in vitro fabrication of vessels to supply oxygen to the inside of millimeter&#8208;sized scaffold&#8208;free tissues whose cell density is &#8776;200 million cells mL&#8722;1, corresponding to those of native tissues, is shown. Hierarchical vascular networks by anastomosis of capillaries and a large vessel are essential for oxygen supply, whereas a large vessel or capillary networks alone make negligible contributions to the supply. The hierarchical vascular networks are formed by a top&#8208;down approach, which offers a new option for ex vivo whole organs without decellularization and 3D&#8208;bioprinting.

A simple small molecule 10&#8208;(4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;3,7&#8208;bis(4&#8208;vinylphenyl)&#8208;10H&#8208;phenoxazine is developed for in situ fabrication of polymer hole conductor (CL&#8208;MCz) via a facile and low&#8208;temperature cross&#8208;linking technology. The device with CL&#8208;MCz yields a champion power conversion efficiency of 23.9% along with an extremely low energy loss down to 0.41 eV.








Abstract
Poly[bis(4&#8208;phenyl)(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) represents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hole transport material (HTM) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, unsatisfied surface properties of PTAA and high energy disorder in the bulk film hinder the further enhancement of device performance. Herein, a simple small molecule 10&#8208;(4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;3,7&#8208;bis(4&#8208;vinylphenyl)&#8208;10H&#8208;phenoxazine (MCz&#8208;VPOZ) is strategically developed for in situ fabrication of polymer hole conductor (CL&#8208;MCz) via a facile and low&#8208;temperature cross&#8208;linking technology. The resulting polymer CL&#8208;MCz offers high energy ordering and improved electrical conductivity, as well as appropriate energy&#8208;level alignment, enabling efficient charge carrier collection in the devices. Meanwhile, CL&#8208;MCz synchronously provides satisfied surface wettability and interfacial functionalization, facilitating the formation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films with fewer bulk iodine vacancies and suppressed carrier recombination. Significantly, the device with CL&#8208;MCz yields a champion efficiency of 23.9% along with an extremely low energy loss down to 0.41 eV, which represents the highest reported efficiency for non&#8208;PTAA&#8208;based polymer HTMs in inverted PSCs. Furthermore, the corresponding unencapsulated devices exhibit competitive shelf&#8208;life stability under various operational stressors up to 2500 h, reflecting high promises of CL&#8208;MCz in the scalable PSC application. This work underscores the promising potential of the cross&#8208;linking approach in preparing low&#8208;cost, stable, and efficient polymer HTMs toward reliable PSCs.

         <title>A New Class of Cluster&#8211;Matrix Nanocomposite Made of Fully Miscible Components</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The prospect for creating highly metastable nanocomposite materials made from fully miscible alloy systems, like Ni&#8211;Cu, is opened. The cluster ion beam deposition technique allows stabilization of 2000&#8208;atom Ni&#8208;clusters in a Cu&#8208;matrix with varying macroscopic concentration. Consequently, unique magnetic and magnetotransport properties are evident as a function of cluster concentration and enthalpy&#8208;driven cluster dissolution.








Abstract
Nanocomposite materials, consisting of two or more phases, at least one of which has a nanoscale dimension, play a distinctive role in materials science because of the multiple possibilities for tailoring their structural properties and, consequently, their functionalities. In addition to the challenges of controlling the size, size distribution, and volume fraction of nanometer phases, thermodynamic stability conditions limit the choice of constituent materials. This study goes beyond this limitation by showing the possibility of achieving nanocomposites from a bimetallic system, which exhibits complete miscibility under equilibrium conditions. A series of nanocomposite samples with different compositions are synthesized by the co&#8208;deposition of 2000&#8208;atom Ni&#8208;clusters and a flux of Cu&#8208;atoms using a novel cluster ion beam deposition system. The retention of the metastable nanostructure is ascertained from atom probe tomography (APT), magnetometry, and magnetotransport studies. APT confirms the presence of nanoscale regions with &#8776;100 at% Ni. Magnetometry and magnetotransport studies reveal superparamagnetic behavior and magnetoresistance stemming from the single&#8208;domain ferromagnetic Ni&#8208;clusters embedded in the Cu&#8208;matrix. Essentially, the magnetic properties of the nanocomposites can be tailored by the precise control of the Ni concentration. The initial results offer a promising direction for future research on nanocomposites consisting of fully miscible elements.

         <title>Efficient Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells on Industrially Compatible Textured Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, an anion&#8208;engineered additive strategy is reported to modify the crystallization process of perovskite films on industrially feasible double&#8208;side textured silicon, which enables conformal deposition with improved film crystallinity and reduced trap density. This allows the fabrication of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with efficiencies of 28.9% (certified efficiency of 27.9%) and 25.1% for areas of 1 and 16&#160;cm2, respectively.








Abstract
Monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells promise power&#8208;conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding the Shockley&#8208;Queisser limit of single&#8208;junction solar cells. The conformal deposition of perovskites on industrially feasible textured silicon solar cells allows for both lowered manufacturing costs and a higher matched photocurrent density, compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art tandems using front&#8208;side flat or mildly textured silicon. However, the inferior crystal quality of perovskite films grown on fully&#8208;textured silicon compromises the photovoltaic performance. Here, an anion&#8208;engineered additive strategy is developed to control the crystallization process of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite films, which enables improved film crystallinity, reduced trap density, and conformal deposition on industrially textured silicon. This strategy allows the fabrication of 28.6%&#8208;efficient perovskite/silicon heterojunction tandem solar cells (certified 27.9%, 1&#160;cm2). This approach is compatible with the scalable fabrication of tandems on industrially textured silicon, demonstrating an efficiency of 25.1% for an aperture area of 16&#160;cm2. The anion&#8208;engineered additive significantly improves the operating stability of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells, and the encapsulated tandem solar cells retain over 80% of their initial performance following 2000&#160;h of operation under full 1&#8208;sun illumination in ambient conditions.

         <title>Observation of Multi&#8208;Directional Energy Transfer in a Hybrid Plasmonic&#8211;Excitonic Nanostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrafast charge and energy exchange across the interface of a hybrid plasmonic heterostructure are explored with momentum resolved electron spectroscopy and diffraction. The results identify a multi&#8208;directional energy exchange on timescales shorter than the electronic thermalization of the nanometal, driven by a non&#8208;linear plasmon&#8211;exciton interaction. Non&#8208;radiative exciton recombination, electron&#8211;phonon coupling, and diffusive charge&#8208;transfer determine the subsequent energy backflow.








Abstract
Hybrid plasmonic devices involve a nanostructured metal supporting localized surface plasmons to amplify light&#8211;matter interaction, and a non&#8208;plasmonic material to functionalize charge excitations. Application&#8208;relevant epitaxial heterostructures, however, give rise to ballistic ultrafast dynamics that challenge the conventional semiclassical understanding of unidirectional nanometal&#8208;to&#8208;substrate energy transfer. Epitaxial Au nanoislands are studied on WSe2 with time&#8208; and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy and femtosecond electron diffraction: this combination of techniques resolves material, energy, and momentum of charge&#8208;carriers and phonons excited in the heterostructure. A strong non&#8208;linear plasmon&#8211;exciton interaction that transfers the energy of sub&#8208;bandgap photons very efficiently to the semiconductor is observed, leaving the metal cold until non&#8208;radiative exciton recombination heats the nanoparticles on hundreds of femtoseconds timescales. The results resolve a multi&#8208;directional energy exchange on timescales shorter than the electronic thermalization of the nanometal. Electron&#8211;phonon coupling and diffusive charge&#8208;transfer determine the subsequent energy flow. This complex dynamics opens perspectives for optoelectronic and photocatalytic applications, while providing a constraining experimental testbed for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art&#160;modelling.

         <title>Multimorphic Materials: Spatially Tailoring Mechanical Properties via Selective Initiation of Interpenetrating Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two disparate polymer networks are created simultaneously using non&#8208;interacting chemical reactions and light as a stimulus. Upon turning the light on, the polymers want to phase&#8208;separate like oil and water, but the process is hindered as they interlock. Thus, the degree and location of phase separation, and in&#8208;turn mechanical properties, can be precisely controlled by the &#8220;flick of a switch&#8221;.








Abstract
Access to multimaterial polymers with spatially localized properties and robust interfaces is anticipated to enable new capabilities in soft robotics, such as smooth actuation for advanced medical and manufacturing technologies. Here, orthogonal initiation is used to create interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) with spatial control over morphology and mechanical properties. Base catalyzes the formation of a stiff and strong polyurethane, while blue LEDs initiate the formation of a soft and elastic polyacrylate. IPN morphology is controlled by when the LED is turned &#8220;on&#8221;, with large phase separation occurring for short time delays (&#8776;1&#8211;2 min) and a mixed morphology for longer time delays (&gt;5&#160;min), which is supported by dynamic mechanical analysis, small angle X&#8208;ray scattering, and atomic force microscopy. Through tailoring morphology, tensile moduli and fracture toughness can be tuned across &#8776;1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude. Moreover, a simple spring model is used to explain the observed mechanical behavior. Photopatterning produces &#8220;multimorphic&#8221; materials, where morphology is spatially localized with fine precision (&lt;100&#160;&#181;m), while maintaining a uniform chemical composition throughout to mitigate interfacial failure. As a final demonstration, the fabrication of hinges represents a possible use case for multimorphic materials in soft robotics.

         <title>Fast and Dynamic Mapping of the Protein Corona on Nanoparticle Surfaces by Photocatalytic Proximity Labeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein corona broadly affects the delivery of nanomedicines in vivo. Here, a photocatalytic proximity labeling technology in nanoparticles (nano&#8208;PPL) is developed for in situ labeling of corona proteins. Nano&#8208;PPL exhibits a significantly improved temporal resolution (5 s duration) and reveals precise dynamics of protein coronas on anionic and cationic nanoparticles. This technology represents a significant methodological advance toward nano&#8208;protein interactions.








Abstract
Protein corona broadly affects the delivery of nanomedicines in vivo. Although it has been widely studied by multiple strategies like centrifugal sedimentation, the rapidly forming mechanism and the dynamic structure of the protein corona at the seconds level remains challenging. Here, a photocatalytic proximity labeling technology in nanoparticles (nano&#8208;PPL) is developed. By fabricating a &#8220;core&#8208;shell&#8221; nanoparticle co&#8208;loaded with chlorin e6 catalyst and biotin&#8208;phenol probe, nano&#8208;PPL technology is validated for the rapid and precise labeling of corona proteins in situ. Nano&#8208;PPL significantly improves the temporal resolution of nano&#8208;protein interactions to 5 s duration compared with the classical centrifugation method (&gt;30 s duration). Furthermore, nano&#8208;PPL achieves the fast and dynamic mapping of the protein corona on anionic and cationic nanoparticles, respectively. Finally, nano&#8208;PPL is deployed to verify the effect of the rapidly formed protein corona on the initial interaction of nanoparticles with cells. These findings highlight a significant methodological advance toward nano&#8208;protein interactions in the delivery of nanomedicines in vivo.

         <title>Imaging Guided Endogenic H2&#8208;Augmented Electrochemo&#8208;Sonodynamic Domino Co&#8208;therapy of Tumor in Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective imaging&#8208;guided/&#8208;assessed H2&#8208;therapy of tumors based on a joint electrochemo&#8208;sonodynamic treatment (H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy) is developed. The endogenic H2&#8208;triggered &#8220;domino effect&#8221; in tumor tissue is clearly revealed. The developed H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy guided by US imaging in vivo will open up a feasible new way for green, economic, and effective treatment of cancer in the future.








Abstract
Precise and on&#8208;demand release of sufficient hydrogen (H2) to tumor sites remains a key challenge for emerging H2&#8208;oncotherapy, and little is known about the physiological effects of &#8220;abundant&#8221; H2 on complex tumor microenvironments (TME). Here, a highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective imaging&#8208;guided/&#8208;assessed H2&#8208;therapy of tumors based on a joint electrochemo&#8208;sonodynamic treatment (H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy) with strong &#8220;domino effect&#8221; triggered by endogenous H2 generation at tumor sites is reported to speedily eliminate tumor tissue (&#8804;80&#160;mm3) within 1&#160;day. Adequate H2 is controllably generated in tumor sites through mild electrochemistry in vivo due to acidic TME by using clinical acupuncture Fe needles as electrodes. Besides starvation damage due to gas blockage/destruction of vessels, nano&#8208;/micro&#8208;bubbles of H2 formed in situ can elevate the tumor's internal temperature and burst vessels to further destroy the tumor&#160;under ultrasound irradiation. Remarkably, vulnerable homeostasis of TME is disturbed as H2 also participates in the physiological activity of tumor cells, leading to tumor dysfunction. Last but not least, the body's inflammatory response to cancer is reduced after the treatment, which is beneficial for the body's immune system during post&#8208;treatment recovery. Based on all of these merits, the H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy provides a potentially safe and viable therapeutic strategy for future clinical applications.

         <title>Formation Mechanism and Bandgap Reduction of GaN&#8211;ZnO Solid&#8208;Solution Thin Films Fabricated by Nanolamination of Atomic Layer Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanolamination of GaN and ZnO layers by atomic layer deposition is employed to fabricate (GaN)1&#8722;x(ZnO)x homogenous solid&#8208;solution films with 0.39 &#8806; x &#8806; 0.79 by varying the cycle ratios. The density functional theory calculations using a superlattice model are performed to evaluate and validate the reduction of bandgaps that results in enhanced visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.








Abstract
Nanolamination of GaN and ZnO layers by atomic layer deposition (ALD) is employed to fabricate GaN&#8211;ZnO homogenous solid&#8208;solution thin films because it offers more precise control of the stoichiometry. By varying the ALD cycle ratios of GaN:ZnO from 5:10 to 10:5, the (GaN)1&#8722;x(ZnO)x films with 0.39 &#8806; x &#8806; 0.79 are obtained. The formation of solid solution is explained based on the atomic stacking and preferred orientation of the layers of GaN and ZnO. However, the growth rates of GaN and ZnO during the lamination process are different from those of pure GaN and ZnO films. It is found that GaN grows faster on ZnO, whereas ZnO grows slower on GaN. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed using a superlattice model for GaN and ZnO laminated layers fabricated by ALD to understand the difference of density of states (DOS) and evaluate the bandgaps for various atomic configurations in the solid&#8208;solution films. The band positions are experimentally defined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. Significant bandgap reduction of the solid solutions is observed, which can be explained by the DOS from the DFT calculations. Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is conducted to confirm the applicability of the solid&#8208;solution films.

         <title>Fullerene&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Crystal&#8208;Induced Micrometer&#8208;Scale Charge&#8208;Carrier Diffusion in Organic Bulk Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;mobility fullerene liquid crystal is introduced into the active layer of organic solar cells (OSCs) to provide a fast channel for charge&#8208;carrier transport, reduce energetic disorder and trap density via enhancing crystallization, and then realize micrometer&#8208;scale charge&#8208;carrier diffusion, leading to the impressive power conversion efficiencies of 15.23% for OSCs with the thickness approaching 500 nm.








Abstract
The short charge&#8208;carrier diffusion length (LD) (100&#8211;300&#160;nm) in organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) impedes the further improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs), especially for thick&#8208;film (&gt;400&#160;nm) devices matching with industrial solution processing. Here a facile method is developed to efficiently increase LD and then improve PCEs of OSCs via introducing a fullerene liquid crystal, F1, into the active layer. F1 combines the inherent high electron mobility of fullerene and strong self&#8208;assembly capacity of liquid crystal, providing a fast channel for charge&#8208;carrier transport&#160;and reducing energetic disorder and trap density in BHJ film via enhancing crystallization. Typically, in PM6:Y6:F1 BHJ, the enhanced charge&#8208;carrier mobility (&gt;10&#8722;2 cm&#8722;2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and prolonged charge&#8208;carrier lifetime (55.3 &#181;s) are acquired to realize the record LD of 1.6 or 2.4&#160;&#181;m for electron or hole, respectively, which are much higher than those of the PM6:Y6 binary sample and comparable to or even better than those values reported for some inorganic/hybrid materials, such as CuInxGa(1&#8722;x)Se2 (CIGS) and perovskite thin films. Benefitting from the micrometer&#8208;scale LD, the PM6:Y6:F1 ternary OSCs sustain a remarkable PCE of 15.23% with the active layer thickness approaching 500&#160;nm.

         <title>Electron Conductive and Transparent Hydrogels for Recording Brain Neural Signals and Neuromodulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is proposed to break the current bottleneck of implantable materials, which demonstrate a suit of desirable performances including matched modulus, good transparency, and high conductivity. The hydrogel electrode is successfully utilized for optogenetic neuromodulation and simultaneously recording the brain's neural signals, establishing the correlation between brain neural signals and corresponding limb behavior.








Abstract
Recording brain neural signals and optogenetic neuromodulations open&#160;frontiers in decoding brain neural information and neurodegenerative disease therapeutics. Conventional implantable probes suffer from modulus mismatch with biological tissues and an irreconcilable tradeoff between transparency and electron conductivity. Herein, a strategy is proposed to address these tradeoffs, which generates conductive and transparent hydrogels with polypyrrole&#8208;decorated microgels as cross&#8208;linkers. The optical transparency of the electrodes can be attributed to the special structures that allow light waves to bypass the microgel particles and minimize their interaction. Demonstrated by probing the hippocampus of rat brains, the biomimetic electrode shows a prolonged capacity for simultaneous optogenetic neuromodulation and recording of brain neural signals. More importantly, an intriguing brain&#8211;machine interaction is realized, which involves signal input to the brain, brain neural signal generation, and controlling limb behaviors. This breakthrough work represents a significant scientific advancement toward decoding brain neural information and developing neurodegenerative disease therapies.

         <title>Strain Engineering of Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode Enables Exceptional Cyclability in Pouch&#8208;Type Full Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a super&#8208;dispersed Nb&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;rich cathode, which consists of the elongated and radially aligned primary particles with rich oxygen stable {001} planes. The resultant cathode effectively homogenizes the intragranular and intergranular strain and greatly inhibits the Li/Ni disordering and lattice oxygen loss during de&#8208;/lilthiation, leading to superior electrochemical performances at various rates and operating temperatures.








Abstract
Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are at the forefront of the development of high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion batteries, yet the extensive applications are retarded by the deteriorative capacity and thermal instability. Herein, an in situ co&#8208;precipitation strategy is implemented to achieve the novel super&#8208;dispersed Nb&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;rich cathode that consists of the elongated and radially aligned primary particles with increased oxygen stable {001} planes. The unique microstructure homogenizes the intragranular and intergranular strain distribution and stabilizes the spherical secondary particles, effectively inhibiting microcrack formation and propagation and surface degradation. The super&#8208;dispersed Nb doping prevents the Li/Ni disordering and lattice oxygen escape, thereby further strengthening the crystal structure and thermal stability. Accordingly, this cathode delivers a high reversible capacity of 229.0 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C with much better retention at 55 &#176;C and 5 C after 100 cycles than the conventional Nb&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;rich cathodes. In a pouch&#8208;type full cell, it exhibits exceptionally long life with a capacity retention of 91.9% at 1 C after 500 cycles and 80.5% at 5 C after 2000 cycles within 3.0&#8211;4.2&#160;V, greatly prolonging the service period to cater to the lightweight and intelligence of electric vehicles.

         <title>Transparent Porous Conductive Substrates for Gas&#8208;Phase Photoelectrochemical Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transparent gas diffusion electrodes are developed via the F&#8208;doped SnO2 coating of SiO2 fused fiber felts. These highly porous and conductive substrates are amenable to the disposition of various semiconductors and are employed herein to demonstrate photoelectrode membrane assemblies for solar&#8208;driven H2 production in a gas&#8208;phase flow cell.








Abstract
Gas diffusion electrodes are essential components of common fuel and electrolysis cells but are typically made from graphitic carbon or metallic materials, which do not allow light transmittance and thus limit the development of gas&#8208;phase based photoelectrochemical devices. Herein, the simple and scalable preparation of F&#8208;doped SnO2 (FTO) coated SiO2 interconnected fiber felt substrates is reported. Using 2&#8211;5&#160;&#181;m diameter fibers at a loading of 4&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, the resulting substrates have porosity of 90%, roughness factor of 15.8, and Young's Modulus of 0.2&#160;GPa. A 100 nm conformal coating of FTO via atmospheric chemical vapor deposition gives sheet resistivity of 20 &#177; 3 &#937; sq&#8722;1 and loss of incident light of 41% at illumination wavelength of 550&#160;nm. The coating of various semiconductors on the substrates is established including Fe2O3 (chemical bath deposition), CuSCN and Cu2O (electrodeposition), and conjugated polymers (dip coating), and liquid&#8208;phase photoelectrochemical performance commensurate with flat FTO substrates is confirmed. Finally, gas phase H2 production is demonstrated with a polymer semiconductor photocathode membrane assembly at 1&#8208;Sun photocurrent density on the order of 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and Faradaic efficiency of 40%.

         <title>Dual Topology of Dirac Electron Transport and Photogalvanic Effect in Low&#8208;Dimensional Topological Insulator Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stacking layer number&#8208;dependent electron structure, quantum properties, and circularly (linearly) polarized photogalvanic effect are assessed in the low&#8208;dimensional dual topological superlattices (TSLs) (Bi2Se3)&#8208;(Bi2/Bi2Se3)N. The results show that the surface electronic structure of the dual TSLs is highly tunable and well&#8208;regulated for quantum transport and photoexcitation, which shed light on engineering for opto&#8208;electronic/spintronic applications.








Abstract
Dual topological insulators, simultaneously protected by time&#8208;reversal symmetry and crystalline symmetry, open great opportunities to explore different symmetry&#8208;protected metallic surface states. However, the conventional dual topological states located on different facets hinder integration into planar opto&#8208;electronic/spintronic devices. Here, dual topological superlattices (TSLs) Bi2Se3&#8208;(Bi2/Bi2Se3)N with limited stacking layer number N are constructed. Angle&#8208;resolved photoelectron emission spectra of the TSLs identify the coexistence and adjustment of dual topological surface states on Bi2Se3 facet. The existence and tunability of spin&#8208;polarized dual&#8208;topological bands with N on Bi2Se3 facet result in an unconventionally weak antilocalization effect (WAL) with variable WAL coefficient &#945; (maximum close to 3/2) from quantum transport experiments. Most importantly, it is identified that the spin&#8208;polarized surface electrons from dual topological bands exhibit circularly and linearly polarized photogalvanic effect (CPGE and LPGE). It is anticipated that the stacked dual&#8208;topology and stacking layer number controlled bands evolution provide a platform for realizing intrinsic CPGE and LPGE. The results show that the surface electronic structure of the dual TSLs is highly tunable and well&#8208;regulated for quantum transport and photoexcitation, which shed light on engineering for opto&#8208;electronic/spintronic applications.

         <title>Ferroelectric Domain Control of Nonlinear Light Polarization in MoS2 via PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 Thin Films and Free&#8208;Standing Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferroelectric domain patterning enabled approach is developed to achieve nanoscale reconfigurable modulation of the amplitude and polarization of SHG light in MoS2 interfaced with PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 thin films and membranes. The light polarization exhibits threefold symmetry at polar domains and twofold symmetry at domain walls. This study opens up new opportunities for developing smart nano&#8208;photonics and optical computing systems.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) such as MoS2 exhibit exceptionally strong nonlinear optical responses, while nanoscale control of the amplitude, polar orientation, and phase of the nonlinear light in TMDCs remains challenging. In this work, by interfacing monolayer MoS2 with epitaxial PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (PZT) thin films and free&#8208;standing PZT membranes, the amplitude and polarization of the second harmonic generation (SHG) signal are modulated via ferroelectric domain patterning, which demonstrates that PZT membranes can lead to in&#8208;operando programming of nonlinear light polarization. The interfacial coupling of the MoS2 polar axis with either the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polar domains of PZT or the in&#8208;plane polarization of domain walls tailors the SHG light polarization into different patterns with distinct symmetries, which are modeled via nonlinear electromagnetic theory. This study provides a new material platform that enables reconfigurable design of light polarization at the nanoscale, paving the path for developing novel optical information processing, smart light modulators, and integrated photonic circuits.

         <title>Fast and Durable Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction at the Electron&#8208;Deficient Ruthenium&#8211;Ruthenium Oxide Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ru/RuO2 in&#8208;plane heterostructure is designed as an efficient electrocatalyst toward the alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). The interfacial Ru and RuO2 domains are the optimal H and OH adsorption sites, respectively. The Ru domains are electron deficient and show substantially improved inoxidizability. The results highlight the significance of establishing robust and multifunctional heterointerfaces toward fast alkaline HOR and beyond.








Abstract
The slow hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics under alkaline conditions remain a critical challenge for the practical application of alkaline exchange membrane fuel cells. Herein, Ru/RuO2 in&#8208;plane heterostructures are designed with abundant active Ru&#8211;RuO2 interface domains as efficient electrocatalysts for the HOR in alkaline media. The experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that interfacial Ru and RuO2 domains at Ru&#8211;RuO2 interfaces are the optimal H and OH adsorption sites, respectively, endowing the well&#8208;defined Ru(100)/RuO2(200) interface as the preferential region for fast alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis. More importantly, the metallic Ru domains become electron deficient due to the strong interaction with RuO2 domains and show substantially improved inoxidizability, which is vital to maintain durable HOR electrocatalytic activity. The optimal Ru/RuO2 heterostructured electrocatalyst exhibits impressive alkaline HOR activity with an exchange current density of 8.86&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and decent durability. The exceptional electrocatalytic performance of Ru/RuO2 in&#8208;plane heterostructure can be attributed to the robust and multifunctional Ru&#8211;RuO2 interfaces endowed by the unique metal&#8211;metal oxide domains.

         <title>Weakening Li+ De&#8208;solvation Barrier for Cryogenic Li&#8211;S Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antecedent theoretical simulations decipher the correlation between lithium salt concentration and Li+ desolvation barrier in the electrolyte, indicating dilute electrolytes can enhance kinetics of sulfur cathode effectively. This insight endows Li&#8211;S pouch cells with an ultra&#8208;high energy density of 350 Wh kg&#8208;1 at 0 &#176;C, demonstrating great&#160;potential for&#160;cryogenic&#160;Li&#8211;S&#160;batteries.








Abstract
Li&#8211;S batteries hold promise for pushing cell&#8208;level energy densities beyond 300&#160;Wh kg&#8208;1 while operating at low temperatures (LTs, below 0&#160;&#176;C). However, the capacity release of existing Li&#8211;S batteries at LTs is still barely satisfactory, and there is almost no verification of the practicability of Li&#8211;S batteries at LTs in the Ah&#8208;level pouch cell. Here, antecedent molecular dynamics (MDs) combined with density functional theory analysis are used to systematically investigate Li+ solvation structure in conventional Li&#8211;S batteries at LTs, which unprecedentedly reveals the positive correlation between lithium salt concentration and Li+ de&#8208;solvation barrier, indicating dilute electrolytes can enhance the Li+ de&#8208;solvation kinetics and thus improve the capacity performance of cryogenic Li&#8211;S batteries. These insights derived from theoretical simulations invested Li&#8211;S batteries with a 67.34% capacity retention at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C compared to their room temperature performance. In particular, an Ah&#8208;level Li&#8211;S pouch cell using dilute electrolytes with a high sulfur loading (5.6&#160;mg cm&#8208;2) and lean electrolyte condition is fabricated, which delivers a discharge capacity of about 1000 mAh g&#8208;1 and ultra&#8208;high energy density of 350&#160;Wh kg&#8208;1 at 0&#160;&#176;C, offering a promising route toward a practical high&#8208;energy cryogenic Li&#8211;S battery.

         <title>3D Cold&#8208;Trap Environment Printing for Long&#8208;Cycle Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative 3D cold trap environment printing technology (3DCEP) is proposed in this work to fabricate a MXene/Zn&#8208;P aerogel anode with highly aligned arrangement. Benefitting from unique high lattice matching and physical confinement effects inside the electrode, it can effectively inhibit the Zn dendrite growth and Zn&#8208;P corrosion in electrolytes. Finally, a 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P//MXene/Co&#8208;MnHCF full cell with long cyclic life can be realized.








Abstract
Zn powder (Zn&#8208;P)&#8208;based anodes are always regarded as ideal anode candidates for zinc ion batteries owing to their low cost and ease of processing. However, the intrinsic negative properties of Zn&#8208;P&#8208;based anodes such as easy corrosion and uncontrolled dendrite growth have limited their further applications. Herein, a novel 3D cold&#8208;trap environment printing (3DCEP) technology is proposed to achieve the MXene and Zn&#8208;P (3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P) anode with highly ordered arrangement. Benefitting from the unique inhibition mechanism of high lattice matching and physical confinement effects within the&#160;3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P anode, it can effectively homogenize the Zn2+ flux and alleviate the Zn deposition rate of the 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P anode during Zn plating&#8211;stripping. Consequently, the 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P anode exhibits a superior cycling lifespan of 1400&#160;h with high coulombic efficiency of &#8776;9.2% in symmetric batteries. More encouragingly, paired with MXene and Co doped MnHCF cathode via 3D cold&#8208;trap environment printing (3 DCEP&#8208;MXene/Co&#8208;MnHCF), the 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P//3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Co&#8208;MnHCF full battery delivers high cyclic durability with the capacity retention of 95.7% after 1600 cycles. This study brings an inspired universal pathway to rapidly fabricate a reversible Zn anode with highly ordered arrangement in a cold environment for micro&#8208;zinc storage systems.

         <title>Many&#8208;Body Correlations and Exciton Complexes in CsPbBr3 Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many&#8208;body interactions in exciton complexes are crucial in many devices, for example, lasers, LEDs, and quantum light sources. Here, a combination of single quantum&#8208;dot photoluminescence spectroscopy at cryogenic temperatures and configuration&#8208;interaction calculations reveals the size&#8208;dependent binding energies of trions (7&#8211;17&#160;meV) and biexcitons (15&#8211;30&#160;meV) in CsPbBr3&#160;quantum dots.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic lead&#8208;halide perovskite (LHP) (CsPbX3, X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br, I) quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as a competitive platform for classical light&#8208;emitting devices (in the weak light&#8211;matter interaction regime, e.g., LEDs and laser), as well as for devices exploiting strong light&#8211;matter interaction at room temperature. Many&#8208;body interactions and quantum correlations among photogenerated exciton complexes play an essential role, for example, by determining the laser threshold, the overall brightness of LEDs, and the single&#8208;photon purity in quantum light sources. Here, by combining cryogenic single&#8208;QD photoluminescence spectroscopy with configuration&#8208;interaction (CI) calculations, the size&#8208;dependent trion and biexciton binding energies are addressed. Trion binding energies increase from 7&#160;to 17&#160;meV for QD sizes decreasing from 30&#160;to 9&#160;nm, while the biexciton binding energies increase from 15&#160;to 30&#160;meV, respectively. CI calculations quantitatively corroborate the experimental results and suggest that the effective dielectric constant for biexcitons slightly deviates from the one of the single excitons, potentially as a result of coupling to the lattice in the multiexciton regime. The findings here provide a deep insight into the multiexciton properties in all&#8208;inorganic LHP QDs, essential for classical and quantum optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Engineering the Electronic Structure of Single&#8208;Atom Iron Sites with Boosted Oxygen Bifunctional Activity for Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to create a single&#8208;atom Fe catalyst on a mesoporous NC material by engineering the electronic structures of the metal sites is reported. This catalyst achieves remarkable electrocatalytic activity in the oxygen reduction reaction&#160;and oxygen evolution reaction, and demonstrates great potential in zinc&#8211;air batteries. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the optimized electronic structure of Fe1N4O1 moieties contributes to excellent electrocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries typically require efficient, durable, and inexpensive bifunctional electrocatalysts to support oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER). However, sluggish kinetics and mass transportation challenges must be addressed if the performance of these catalysts is to be enhanced. Herein, a strategy to fabricate a catalyst comprising atomically dispersed iron atoms supported on a mesoporous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support (Fe SAs/NC) with accessible metal sites and optimized electronic metal&#8211;support interactions is developed. Both the experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the engineered electronic structures of the metal active sites can regulate the charge distribution of Fe centers to optimize the adsorption/desorption of oxygenated intermediates. The Fe SAs/NC containing Fe1N4O1 sites achieves remarkable ORR activity over the entire pH range, with half&#8208;wave potentials of 0.93, 0.83, and 0.75&#160;V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) in alkaline, acidic, and neutral electrolytes, respectively. In addition, it demonstrates a promising low overpotential of 320&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for OER in alkaline conditions. The zinc&#8211;air battery assembled with Fe SAs/NC exhibits superior performance than that of Pt/C+RuO2 counterpart in terms of peak power density, specific capacity, and cycling stability. These findings demonstrate the importance of the electronic structure engineering of metal sites in directing catalytic activity.

         <title>Initiating Reversible Aqueous Copper&#8211;Tellurium Conversion Reaction with High Volumetric Capacity through Electrolyte Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The copper&#8211;tellurium conversion reaction with high volumetric capacity of 3927&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;3 and long discharge plateau are investigated. The thermodynamic&#8211;kinetic asymmetries of the Cu&#8211;Te multiphase&#8208;conversion and oxidation&#8208;failure mechanisms are systematically revealed. The developed precise electrolyte engineering overcomes inherent oxidative distress and extends the cycling life of the battery by about three orders of magnitude.








Abstract
Pursuing conversion&#8208;type cathodes with high volumetric capacity that can be used in aqueous environments remains rewarding and challenging. Tellurium (Te) is a promising alternative electrode due to its intrinsic attractive electronic conductivity and high theoretical volumetric capacity yet still to be explored. Herein, the kinetically/thermodynamically co&#8208;dominat copper&#8211;tellurium (Cu&#8211;Te) alloying phase&#8208;conversion process and corresponding oxidation failure mechanism of tellurium are investigated using in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and comprehensive ex situ characterization techniques. By virtue of the fundamental insights into the tellurium electrode, facile and precise electrolyte engineering (solvated structure modulation or reductive antioxidant addition) is implemented to essentially tackle the dramatic capacity loss in tellurium, affording reversible aqueous Cu&#8211;Te conversion reaction with an unprecedented ultrahigh volumetric capacity of up to 3927&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;3, a flat long discharge plateau (capacity proportion of &#8776;81%), and an extraordinary level of capacity retention of 80.4% over 2000 cycles at 20&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 of which lifespan thousand&#8208;fold longer than Cu&#8211;Te conversion using CuSO4&#8211;H2O electrolyte. This work paves a significant avenue for expanding high&#8208;performance conversion&#8208;type cathodes toward energetic aqueous multivalent&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Optically Excited Lasing in a Cavity&#8208;Based, High&#8208;Current&#8208;Density Quantum Dot Electroluminescent Device</title>

         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;function colloidal quantum dot (QD) devices that operate as a high&#8208;current density light emitting diode and an optically excited laser are demonstrated. The device structure has been optimized to reduce optical losses and allow for efficient wave&#8208;guiding within the active QD layer. This demonstration represents an important milestone toward the practical implementation of a colloidal QD laser diode.








Abstract
Laser diodes based on solution&#8208;processable materials can benefit numerous technologies including integrated electronics and photonics, telecommunications, and medical diagnostics. An attractive system for implementing these devices is colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). The progress towards a QD laser diode has been hampered by rapid nonradiative Auger decay of optical&#8208;gain&#8208;active multicarrier states, fast device degradation at high current densities required for laser action, and unfavorable competition between optical gain and optical losses in a multicomponent device stack. Here&#160;we&#160;resolve some of these challenges and demonstrate optically excited lasing from fully functional high&#8208;current density electroluminescent (EL) devices with an integrated optical resonator. This advance has become possible due to excellent optical gain properties of continuously graded QDs and a refined device architecture, which allows for highly efficient light amplification in a thin, EL&#8208;active QD layer.

         <title>Macroscale Fabrication of Lightweight and Strong Porous Carbon Foams through Template&#8208;Coating Pair Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The manufacturing of low&#8208;density&#8208;high&#8208;strength carbon materials on a macroscopic length scale has a significant impact on the construction, packaging, and transportation industries. Presented herein is a tunable platform for macroscale fabrication of lightweight and strong pyrolytic carbon foams through template&#8208;coating pair design.








Abstract
Manufacturing of low&#8208;density&#8208;high&#8208;strength carbon foams can benefit the construction, transportation, and packaging industries. One successful route to lightweight and mechanically strong carbon foams involves pyrolysis of polymeric architectures, which is inevitably accompanied by drastic volumetric shrinkage (usually &gt;98%). As such, a challenge of these materials lies in maintaining bulk dimensions of building struts that span orders of magnitude difference in length scale from centimeters to nanometers. This work demonstrates fabrication of macroscale low&#8208;density&#8208;high&#8208;strength carbon foams that feature exceptional dimensional stability through pyrolysis of robust template&#8208;coating pairs. The template serves as the architectural blueprint and contains strength&#8208;imparting properties (e.g., high node density and small strut dimensions); it is composed of a low char&#8208;yielding porous polystyrene backbone with a high carbonization&#8208;onset temperature. The coating serves to imprint and transcribe the template architecture into pyrolytic carbon; it is composed of a high char&#8208;yielding conjugated polymer with a relatively low carbonization&#8208;onset temperature. The designed carbonization mismatch enables structural inheritance, while the decomposition mismatch affords hollow struts, minimizing density. The carbons synthesized through this new framework exhibit remarkable dimensional stability (&#8776;80% dimension retention; &#8776;50% volume retention) and some of the highest specific strengths (&#8776;0.13&#160;GPa g&#8722;1 cm3) among reported carbon foams derived from porous polymer templates.

         <title>Well&#8208;Defined Fullerene Bisadducts Enable High&#8208;Performance Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure&#8208;dependent effects of the four fullerene bisadduct regioisomers on the device performance of tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells are systemically investigated. Benefiting from the favorable molecular packing, energy level alignment, and interfacial interaction, the trans&#8208;3&#8208;based devices yield a champion efficiency of 14.58% with a certified efficiency of 14.30%, representing one of the best&#8208;performing tin&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) are attracting intense research interest due to their excellent optoelectric properties and eco&#8208;friendly features. To further improve the device performance, developing new fullerene derivatives as electron transporter layers (ETLs) is highly demanded. Four well&#8208;defined regioisomers (trans&#8208;2, trans&#8208;3, trans&#8208;4, and e) of diethylmalonate&#8208;C60 bisadduct (DCBA) are isolated and well characterized. The well&#8208;defined molecular structure enables us to investigate the real structure&#8208;dependent effects on photovoltaic performance. It is found that the chemical structures of the regioisomers not only affect their energy levels, but also lead to significant differences in their molecular packings and interfacial contacts. As a result, the devices with trans&#8208;2, trans&#8208;3, trans&#8208;4, and e as ETLs yield efficiencies of 11.69%, 14.58%, 12.59%, and 10.55%, respectively, which are higher than that of the as&#8208;prepared DCBA&#8208;based (10.28%) device. Notably, the trans&#8208;3&#8208;based device also demonstrates a certified efficiency of 14.30%, representing one of the best&#8208;performing TPSCs.

         <title>Control of Molecular Orbital Ordering Using a van der Waals Monolayer Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling and tuning the orbital ordering in a single molecule using a monolayer ferroelectric substrate is realized. This is achieved by adsorbing transition metal phthalocyanine (TMPc) molecules on a ferroelectric monolayer SnTe. The orbital order is probed using low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments, and it is demonstrated that it can be controllably changed by switching the polarization direction of the underlying ferroelectric monolayer.








Abstract
2D ferroelectric materials provide a promising platform for the electrical control of quantum states. In particular, due to their 2D nature, they are suitable for influencing the quantum states of deposited molecules via the proximity effect. Here, electrically controllable molecular states in phthalocyanine molecules adsorbed on monolayer ferroelectric material SnTe are reported. The strain and ferroelectric order in SnTe are found to create a transition between two distinct orbital orders in the adsorbed phthalocyanine molecules. By controlling the polarization of the ferroelectric domain using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), it is successfully demonstrated that orbital order can be manipulated electrically. The results show how ferroelastic coupling in 2D systems allows for control of molecular states, providing a starting point for ferroelectrically switchable molecular orbital ordering and ultimately, electrical control of molecular&#160;magnetism.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme with Asymmetric Electron Distribution for Tumor Catalytic Therapy by Disrupting Tumor Redox and Energy Metabolism Homeostasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the drawbacks of current nanozyme catalytic therapy, a novel Ir&#63743;N5 single&#8208;atom/Cer nanoagent with asymmetric electron distribution is developed, which can improve the efficiency of multienzyme&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions through a substrate&#8208;recyclable manner, thereby disrupting the intracellular redox and energy metabolism homeostasis to achieve efficient tumor therapy.








Abstract
Nanozyme catalytic therapy triggered by tumor&#8208;specific endogenous stimuli is an emerging tumor therapy that attracts wide attention. However, the current therapeutic efficacy of nanozyme catalytic therapy is severely limited by the catalytic efficiency of nanozymes and the concentration of endogenous reaction substrates. Herein, a novel and efficient Ir&#63743;N5 single&#8208;atom (Ir&#63743;N5 SA) nanozyme is developed with multiple enzyme&#8208;like catalytic activities. Due to the synergistic effect of central Ir single&#8208;atom and axial N coordination, Ir&#63743;N5 SA exhibits better enzymatic catalytic performance than Ir&#63743;N4 SA. At tumor sites, Ir&#63743;N5 SA can generate a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through oxidase (OXD)&#8208;like and peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like catalytic activities. Moreover, Ir&#63743;N5 SA can also generate O2 and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through catalase (CAT)&#8208;like and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) oxidase (NOX)&#8208;like catalytic activities, realizing the efficient nanozyme catalytic therapy in a substrate&#8208;cycle manner. Additionally, Ir&#63743;N5 SA can effectively break the intracellular NADH/NAD+ cycle balance by mimicking NOX, and then cooperate with fatty acid synthase cerulenin (Cer) to interfere with the energy metabolism homeostasis of tumor cells. Consequently, the designed Ir&#63743;N5 SA/Cer nanoagent can disrupt redox and metabolic homeostasis in the tumor region through an enzyme&#8208;mimicking cascade reaction, effectively overcoming the shortcomings of current nanozyme catalytic therapy.

Herein, a novel and efficient Ir&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; single-atom (Ir&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; SA) nanozyme is developed with multiple enzyme-like catalytic activities. Due to the synergistic effect of central Ir single-atom and axial N coordination, Ir&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; SA exhibits better enzymatic catalytic performance than Ir&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; SA. At tumor sites, Ir&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; SA can generate a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through oxidase (OXD)-like and peroxidase (POD)-like catalytic activities. Moreover, Ir&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; SA can also generate O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) through catalase (CAT)-like and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) oxidase (NOX)-like catalytic activities, realizing the efficient nanozyme catalytic therapy in a substrate-cycle manner. Additionally, Ir&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; SA can effectively break the intracellular NADH/NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cycle balance by mimicking NOX, and then cooperate with fatty acid synthase cerulenin (Cer) to interfere with the energy metabolism homeostasis of tumor cells. Consequently, the designed Ir&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; SA/Cer nanoagent can disrupt redox and metabolic homeostasis in the tumor region through an enzyme-mimicking cascade reaction, effectively overcoming the shortcomings of current nanozyme catalytic therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Monolithic Tandem Vertical Electrochemical Transistors for Printed Multi&#8208;Valued Logic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design of high&#8208;speed electrochemical ternary logic transistor is presented. A vertically stacked dual channel heterostructure enables a clear manifestation of multiple logic states in 1&#160;V input&#8211;output voltage ranges, through a simple chemical&#8208;tuning of semiconductor materials.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have recently emerged as a feasible candidate to realize the next generation of printable electronics. Especially, their chemical versatility and the unique redox&#8208;based operating principle have provided new possibilities in high&#8208;functioning logic circuitry beyond the traditional binary Boolean logic. Here, a simple strategy to electrochemically realize monolithic multi&#8208;valued logic transistors is presented, which is one of the most promising branches of transistor technology in the forthcoming era of hyper Moore's law. A vertically stacked heterogeneous dual&#8208;channel architecture is introduced with a patterned reference electrode, which enables a facile manifestation of stable and equiprobable ternary logic states with a reduced transistor footprint. The dual&#8208;ion&#8208;penetration mechanism coupled with ultrashort vertical channel even allows a very&#8208;high accessing frequency to multiple logic states reaching over 10&#160;MHz. Furthermore, printed arrays of ternary logic gates with full voltage swing within 1&#160;V are demonstrated.

         <title>Metal Anodes with Ultrahigh Reversibility Enabled by the Closest Packing Crystallography for Sustainable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal strategy is reported to construct dendrite&#8208;free metal anodes with multiple crystal structures (hexagonal close&#8208;packed, face&#8208;centered cubic, and body&#8208;centered cubic) on single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) substrates, which epitaxially match the closest packed facets of metals. The closest packed facets of metal anodes aligned horizontally with substrates, resulting in compact planar construction and excellent chemical stability. Consequently, the metal anodes display high reversibility and outstanding performance.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;growing annual electricity generated from sustainable and intermittent energy such as wind and solar power requires cost effective and reliable electrochemical energy storage. Rechargeable batteries based on multivalent metal anodes such as Zn, Al, and Fe, taking advantage of large&#8208;scale production and affordable cost, have emerged as promising candidates. However, the uncontrollable dendrite&#8208;like metal deposition on regular substrate caused by disordered metal crystallization usually leads to premature failure of batteries and even safety concerns when the dendrite bridges the electrodes. Here it is reported that a series of metal anodes (Zn, Co, Al, Ni, and Fe) with multiple crystal structures (hexagonal close&#8208;packed, face&#8208;centered cubic, and body&#8208;centered cubic) can achieve dendrite&#8208;free and epitaxial deposition on single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) substrates enabled by the closest packing crystallography. Moreover, the closest packed facets are aligned horizontally with the substrates, resulting in compact planar construction and excellent chemical stability even at an unprecedented current density of 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2. The full cells under a practical anode&#8208;to&#8208;cathode capacity ratio of 2.3 show a cycling life span of over 800 cycles with Coulombic efficiency of &gt;&#160;99.9%. The universal approach of regulating metal electrodeposition in this work is expected to boost the development of emerging sustainable energy storage/conversion devices.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Cation Composition Engineering of Hybrid Cs1&#8722;xFAxPbBr3 Nanocrystals for Self&#8208;Healing Electronics Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel post&#8208;synthesis cesium/formamidinium (Cs/FA) mixed&#8208;cation perovskite nanocrystals possess high structural and optoelectronic properties for integration in self&#8208;healing polymer composites. Entropic&#8208;driven self&#8208;healing not only enhances white backlight display performance, but also sustains the working performance of a shattered&#8211;repaired glass substrate laser, thereby representing potentially major advances in optoelectronics and photonics applications.








Abstract
Mixed&#8208;cation hybrid perovskite nanocrystal (HPNC) with high crystallinity, color purity, and tunable optical bandgap offers a practical pathway toward next&#8208;generation&#160;displays. Herein, a two&#8208;step modified hot&#8208;injection combined with cation compositional engineering and surface treatment to synthesize high&#8208;purity cesium/formamidinium lead bromide HPNCs(Cs1&#8208;xFAxPbBr3) is presented. The optimized Cs0.5FA0.5PbBr3 light&#8208;emitting devices (LEDs) exhibit uniform luminescence of 3500&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and a prominent current efficiency of 21.5&#160;cd A&#8722;1. As a proof of concept, a self&#8208;healing polymer (SHP) integrated with white LED backlight and laser prototypes exhibited 4 h autonomous self&#8208;healing through the synergistic effect of weak reversible imine bonds and stronger H&#8208;bonds. First, the SHP&#8208;HPNCs&#8208;initial and SHP&#8208;HPNCs&#8208;cut possess high long&#8208;term stability and dramatically suppressed lead leakage as low as 0.6&#160;ppm along with a low leakage rate of 1.11 &#215; 10&#8722;5 cm2 and 3.36 &#215; 10&#8722;5 cm2 even over 6 months in water. Second, the Cs0.5FA0.5PbBr3 HPNCs and SHP&#8208;induced shattered&#8211;repaired perovskite glass substrate show the lowest lasing threshold values of 1.24 and 8.58 &#181;J cm&#8722;2, respectively. This work provides an integrative and in&#8208;depth approach to exploiting SHP with intrinsic and entropic self&#8208;healing capabilities combined with HPNCs to develop robust and reliable soft&#8208;electronic backlight and laser applications.

Organic Metal Halide Hybrids
Efficient electroluminescent devices can now be fabricated using solution&#8208;processed thin films based on 0D organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs). In article number 2209417, Biwu Ma and co&#8208;workers develop a highly luminescent 0D OMHH containing organic semiconducting cations, which successfully addresses the issues of low conductivity and poor energy alignment of existing 0D OMHHs for electrically driven light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs).

Aerogel Anodes
An innovative 3D cold trap environment printing (3DCEP) technology is proposed by Yujie Li, Jingxin Zhao, Bingang Xu, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2209886 to fabricate a highly aligned aerogel anode with MXene and Zn powder (3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8211;P). Benefitting from the combined induction of laminar flow and ice crystals in the 3DCEP process, MXene and Zn&#8211;P can be arranged in the Zn anode to achieve a unique Zn&#8208;dendrite inhibition effect.

         <title>Resistive Switching Crossbar Arrays Based on Layered Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resistive switching devices made of layered materials (LMs) have shown interesting performance. However, most studies employ fabrication methods and device structures that are not industry&#8208;relevant. In this review, the focus is on the status of crossbar arrays of LMs.








Abstract
Resistive switching (RS) devices are metal/insulator/metal cells that can change their electrical resistance when electrical stimuli are applied between the electrodes, and they can be used to store and compute data. Planar crossbar arrays of RS devices can offer a high integration density (&gt;108&#160;devices mm&#8722;2) and this can be further enhanced by stacking them three&#8208;dimensionally. The advantage of using layered materials (LMs) in RS devices compared to traditional phase&#8208;change materials and metal oxides is that their electrical properties can be adjusted with a higher precision. Here, the key figures&#8208;of&#8208;merit and procedures to implement LM&#8208;based RS devices are defined. LM&#8208;based RS devices fabricated using methods compatible with industry are identified and discussed. The focus is on small devices (size&#160;&lt;&#160;9&#160;&#181;m2) arranged in crossbar structures, since larger devices may be affected by artifacts, such as grain boundaries and flake junctions. How to enhance device performance, so to accelerate the development of this technology, is also discussed.

         <title>Non&#8208;equilibrium&#8208;Growing Aesthetic Ionic Skin for Fingertip&#8208;Like Strain&#8208;Undisturbed Tactile Sensation and Texture Recognition</title>

Abstract
Humans use periodically ridged fingertips to precisely perceive the characteristics of objects via ion&#8208;based fast&#8208; and slow&#8208;adaptive mechanotransduction. However, designing artificial ionic skins with fingertip&#8208;like tactile capabilities remains challenging because of the contradiction between structural compliance and pressure sensing accuracy (e.g., anti&#8208;interference from stretch and texture recognition). Inspired by the formation and modulus&#8208;contrast hierarchical structure of fingertips, we introduce an aesthetic ionic skin grown from a non&#8208;equilibrium Liesegang patterning process. This ionic skin with periodic stiff ridges embedded in a soft hydrogel matrix enables strain&#8208;undisturbed triboelectric dynamic pressure sensing as well as vibrotactile texture recognition. By coupling with another piezoresistive ionogel, we further fabricate an artificial tactile sensory system as a soft robotic skin to mimic the simultaneous fast&#8208; and slow&#8208;adaptive multimodal sensations of fingers in grasping actions. Our approach may inspire the future design of high&#8208;performance ionic tactile sensors for intelligent applications in soft robotics and prosthetics.

         <title>Enabling 420&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 Stable Lithium&#8208;Metal Pouch Cells by Lanthanum Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystal plane regulation strategy for lithium&#160;(Li)&#8208;metal anodes is reported by in&#160;situ&#160;lanthanum (La) doping. La&#8208;doped Li metal enables a preferred crystal plane change to (200) from (110) plane, thereby decreasing the reactivity of Li metal toward electrolytes and establishing a stable interface. Consequently, dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8208;metal batteries are achieved under realistic conditions.








Abstract
Lithium (Li)&#160;metal, a promising anode for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries, typically grows along the low&#8208;surface energy (110) plane in the plating process, resulting in uncontrollable dendrite growth and unstable interface. Herein, an unexpected Li growth behavior by lanthanum (La) doping is reported: the preferred orientation turns to (200) from (110) plane, enabling 2D nuclei rather than the usual 1D nuclei upon Li deposition and thus forming a dense and dendrite&#8208;free morphology even at an ultrahigh areal capacity of 10&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. Noticeably, La doping further decreases the reactivity of Li metal toward electrolytes, thereby establishing a stable interface. The dendrite&#8208;free, stable Li anode enables a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.30% at 8&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 for asymmetric Li||LaF3&#8211;Cu cells. A 3.1&#160;Ah LaF3&#8211;Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cell at a high energy density (425.73&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1) with impressive cycling stability (0.0989% decay&#160;per&#160;cycle) under lean electrolyte (1.76&#160;g&#160;Ah&#8722;1) and high cathode loading (5.77&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2) using this doped Li anode is further demonstrated.

         <title>Reconfigurable Electrical Networks within a Conductive Hydrogel Composite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft conductors coupled with reversible electrical conductivity can enable new functions in wearable electronics and soft robotics. In&#160;this&#160;work, a reconfigurable conductive hydrogel composite is developed, which is made of silver flakes, polyacrylamide, and alginate hydrogel. By simply applying dehydration and rehydration treatments, the material can achieve reversible electrical conductivity. This reconfigurability can help the material to recover from severe damage or control locomotion of a legged robot.








Abstract
Soft materials that exhibit compliance, programmability, and reconfigurability can have a transformative impact as electronic skin for applications in wearable electronics/soft robotics. There has been significant progress in soft conductive materials; however, achieving electrically&#160;controlled and reversible changes in conductivity and circuit connectivity remains challenging. To overcome this limitation, a&#160;soft material architecture with reconfigurable conductive networks of silver flakes embedded within a hydrogel matrix is presented. The conductive networks can be reversibly created/disconnected through various stimuli, including current, humidity, or temperature. Such stimuli affect electrical connectivity of the hydrogel by controlling its water content, which can be modulated by evaporation under ambient conditions (passive dehydration), evaporation through electrical Joule heating (active dehydration), or absorption of additional water (rehydration). The resulting change in electrical conductivity is reversible and repeatable, endowing the composite with on&#8208;demand reconfigurable conductivity. To highlight this material's unique properties, it is shown that conductive traces can be reconfigured after severe damage and revert to lower conductivity after rehydration. Additionally, a quadruped robot is demonstrated that can respond to stimuli by changing direction following exposure to excess water, thereby achieving reprogrammable locomotion behaviors.

         <title>Mass Production of Sulfur&#8208;Tuned Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Zn&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) with highly active M&#63743;N4&#63743;S sites is successfully fabricated in a sustainable and large&#8208;scale manner by utilizing a by&#8208;product of the papermaking industry (i.e., lignosulfonate) as a multifunctional bioligand. The resulting SAC exhibits enhanced oxygen reduction and evolution reactions catalytic performance and shows high durability in Zn&#8211;air batteries.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) show great potential for rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries (ZABs); however, scalable production of SACs from sustainable resources is difficult owing to poor control of the local coordination environment. Herein, lignosulfonate, a by&#8208;product of the papermaking industry, is utilized as a multifunctional bioligand for the mass production of SACs with highly active M&#63743;N4&#63743;S sites (M represents Fe, Cu, and Co) via strong metal&#63743;nitrogen/sulfur coordination. This effectively adjusts the charge distribution and promotes the catalytic performance, leading to highly durable and excellent performance in oxygen reduction and evolution reactions for ZABs. This study paves the way for the industrial production of cost&#8208;effective SACs in a sustainable manner.

         <title>Bistable Joints Enable the Morphing of Hydrogel Sheets with Multistable Configurations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Active joints are designed by using a stiff gel as a frame and a responsive gel as an actuating unit. The response mismatch in the joint with in&#8208;plane gradient leads to folding or twisting with the feature of bistability. Integration of multiple joints into one hydrogel enables the formation of multistable configurations that facilitate designs of hydrogel devices with versatile functions.








Abstract
Joints, as a flexing element to connect different parts, are widespread in natural systems. Various joints exist in the body and play crucial roles to execute gestures and gaits. These scenarios have inspired the design of mechanical joints with passive, hard materials, which usually need an external power supply to drive the transformations. The incorporation of soft and active joints provides a modular strategy to devise soft actuators and robots. However, transformations of responsive joints under external stimuli are usually in uni&#8208;mode with a pre&#8208;determined direction. Here, hydrogel joints capable of folding and twisting transformation in bi&#8208;mode are reported, which enable the composite hydrogel to form multiple configurations under constant conditions. These joints have an in&#8208;plane gradient structure and comprise stiff, passive gel as the frame and soft, active gel as the actuating unit. Under external stimuli, the response mismatch between different gels leads to out&#8208;of&#8208;plane folding or twisting deformation with the feature of bistability. These joints can be modularly integrated with other gels to afford complex deformations and multistable configurations. This approach favors selective control of hydrogel's architectures and versatile design of hydrogel devices, as demonstrated by proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept examples. It shall also merit the development of metamaterials, soft actuators, and robots, etc.

         <title>Engineering Human Brain Assembloids by Microfluidics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel microfluidic system is presented for the spatially controlled patterning of human&#8208;brain region&#8208;specific organoids, allowing for the efficient, scalable, and flexible generation of brain assembloids. Therefore, this microfluidic system has remarkable potential in wide applications of assembloid technology in neurological and biomedical fields.








Abstract
Brain assembloids offer a highly promising strategy to model human brain development and disease, and advance potential studies in regenerative medicine, therapeutic screening, and drug discovery, while it is challenging to produce uniform brain organoids and assemble them flexibly by conventional methods. Here, a multidisciplinary engineered strategy to generate human brain assembloids with desired patterning based on microfluidic technology&#160;is presented. By encapsulating human induced pluripotent stem cells in microcapsules via microfluidic electrospray, brain region&#8208;specific organoids are efficiently formed, which are then introduced into a microfluidic chip consisting of a bottom layer with a micropillar array and a movable upper layer with a complementary microhole array. These brain organoids can settle into microholes and fuse into brain assembloids. As varied organoid microcapsules with designed 1D sequences or 2D arrays can be assembled into the vertical microholes, large coding amounts of fused brain assembloids with desired patterning can be produced. It is found that brain assembloids composed of cortical, hippocampal, and thalamic organoids can grow and function well, characterized with active neural migration and interaction. These features indicate that the suggested flexible, scalable, and controlled microfluidic systems are remarkably potential in wide applications of brain assembloids in neurological and biomedical fields.

         <title>Optimizing the Pd Sites in Pure Metallic Aerogels for Efficient Electrocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel catalyst design strategy is demonstrated for the optimization of Pd sites in pure metallic aerogels by tuning their geometric environments and electronic structures. By diminishing the Pd&#63743;Pd coordination, single&#8208;atom&#8208;like Pd motifs are constructed in the Pd2Hg5 aerogel, which are further fine&#8208;tuned to achieve an excellent electrocatalytic activity and selectivity for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production.








Abstract
Decentralized electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an attractive alternative to the industrial anthraquinone process, the application of which is hindered by the lack of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts in acidic media. Herein, a novel catalyst design strategy is reported to optimize the Pd sites in pure metallic aerogels by tuning their geometric environments and electronic structures. By increasing the Hg content in the Pd&#63743;Hg aerogels, the Pd&#63743;Pd coordination is gradually diminished, resulting in isolated, single&#8208;atom&#8208;like Pd motifs in the Pd2Hg5 aerogel. Further heterometal doping leads to a series of M&#8211;Pd2Hg5 aerogels with an unalterable geometric environment, allowing for sole investigation&#160;of&#160;the electronic effects. Combining theoretical and experimental analyses, a volcano relationship is obtained for the M&#8211;Pd2Hg5 aerogels, demonstrating an effective tunability of the electronic structure of the Pd active sites. The optimized Au&#8211;Pd2Hg5 aerogel exhibits an outstanding H2O2 selectivity of 92.8% as well as transferred electron numbers of &#8776;2.1 in the potential range of 0.0&#8211;0.4 VRHE. This work opens a door for designing metallic aerogel electrocatalysts for H2O2 production and highlights the importance of electronic effects in tuning electrocatalytic performances.

         <title>Nonlocal Cable&#8208;Network Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;plug&#8208;and&#8208;play&#8221; reconfigurable metamaterial platform based on standard coaxial cables and bayonet Neill&#8211;Concelman (BNC) connectors is proposed. Particularly, interesting nonlocal effects can be straightforwardly implemented through coupling unit cells via coaxial cables to their beyond nearest neighbors. Metamaterials with nonlocal interactions from 2nd order to 6th order are assembled and highly unusual dispersion relations than with only local interactions are experimentally demonstrated.








Abstract
Metamaterials are artificial materials in which the atoms of ordinary solids are replaced by tailored functional building blocks. Therefore, previous work has emphasized tailoring the inside of the building blocks, for example, by exploiting local resonances, to realize unusual effective metamaterial properties. However, the wave properties of a metamaterial are not only determined by its building blocks but also by the interactions between these building blocks. Here, reconfigurable &#8220;plug&#8208;and&#8208;play&#8221; electromagnetic metamaterials are introduced for which the building blocks are essentially trivial standard bayonet Neill&#8211;Concelman (BNC) connectors and the effective metamaterial properties are solely achieved by tailoring the local and especially the nonlocal interactions mediated by standard coaxial cables. Unprecedented dispersion relations of the lowest band with multiple regions of slow waves and backward waves are demonstrated. Importantly, the dispersion relation of such metamaterials dominated by nonlocal interactions is not limited by the principle of causality in the same way as for metamaterials designed by local resonances of building blocks.

Since leukocytes actively participate in cancers and inflammation&#8208;related diseases, leukocyte&#8208;based drug delivery systems have attracted much attention in recent years. Herein, recent progress and future perspectives in macrophage&#8208;, neutrophil&#8208;, and lymphocyte&#8208;based drug delivery systems, as well as their combination with other treatments (immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and photodynamic therapy) are reviewed, highlighting promising drug delivery strategies to treat cancers and inflammation&#8208;related diseases.








Abstract
Leukocytes play a vital role in immune responses, including defending against invasive pathogens, reconstructing impaired tissue, and maintaining immune homeostasis. When the immune system is activated in vivo, leukocytes accomplish a series of orderly and complex regulatory processes. While cancer and inflammation&#8208;related diseases like sepsis are critical medical difficulties plaguing humankind around the world, leukocytes have been shown to largely gather at the focal site,&#160;and significantly contribute to&#160;inflammation and cancer progression. Therefore, the living leukocyte&#8208;based&#160;drug delivery systems have attracted considerable attention in recent years due to the innate and specific targeting effect, low immunogenicity, improved therapeutic efficacy, and low reverse effect. In this review, the recent advances in the development of living leukocyte&#8208;based drug delivery systems including macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes as promising treatment strategies for cancer and inflammation&#8208;related diseases are introduced. The advantages, current challenges, and limitations of these delivery systems are also discussed, as well as perspectives on the future development of precision and targeted therapy in the clinics are provided. Collectively, it is expected that such kind of living cell&#8208;based drug delivery system is promising to improve or even revolutionize the treatments of cancers and inflammation&#8208;related diseases in the clinics.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;small Nano&#8208;assemblies as Tumor&#8208;targeted and Renal Clearable Theranostic Agent for Photodynamic Therapy</title>

Abstract
It is a challenge to design photosensitizers to balance between the tumor&#8208;targeting enrichment for precise treatment and efficient clearance within a reasonable timescale for reducing side effects. Herein, we report an ultra&#8208;small nano&#8208;photosensitizer 1a with excellent tumor&#8208;specific accumulation and renal clearance. It was formed from the self&#8208;assembly of compound 1 bearing three TEG arms and two pyridinium groups in water. The positively charged surface with neutral TEG coating enables 1a to efficiently target the tumor, with the signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio reaching as high as 11.5 after tail intravenous injection. The ultra&#8208;small size of 1a with an average diameter of 5.6&#160;nm allows its fast clearance through kidney. Self&#8208;assembly also endows 1a with an 18.2&#8208;fold enhancement of ROS generation rate compared to compound 1 in organic solution. Nano&#8208;PS 1a manifests an excellent PDT efficacy on tumor&#8208;bearing mouse models. This work provides a promising design strategy of photosensitizers with renal clearable and tumor&#8208;targeting ability.

         <title>Phage Display Screening as a Rational Approach to Design Additives for Selective Crystallization Control in Construction Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The design of additives showing strong and selective interactions with certain target surfaces is key to crystallization control in applied reactive multicomponent systems. While suitable chemical motifs can be found through semi&#8208;empirical trial&#8208;and&#8208;error procedures, bioinspired selection techniques offer a more rationally driven approach and explore a much larger space of possible combinations in a single assay. Here we use phage display screening to characterize the surfaces of crystalline gypsum, a mineral of broad relevance for construction applications. Based on next&#8208;generation sequencing of phages enriched during the screening process, we identify a triplet of amino acids, DYH, as main driver for adsorption on the mineral substrate. Furthermore, oligopeptides containing this motif prove to exert their influence in a strictly selective manner during the hydration of cements, where the sulfate reaction (initial setting) is strongly retarded while the silicate reaction (final hardening) remains unaffected. In a final step, these desired additive characteristics are successfully translated from the level of peptides to that of scalable synthetic copolymers. The approach described in this work demonstrates how modern biotechnological methods can be leveraged for the systematic development of efficient crystallization additives for materials science.

         <title>Low&#8208;Valent Manganese Atoms Stabilized on Ceria for Nitrous Oxide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
N2O exhibits unique reactivity in oxidation catalysis, but the high manufacturing costs limit its prospective uses. Direct oxidation of NH3 to N2O can ameliorate this issue but its implementation is thwarted by suboptimal catalyst selectivity and stability, and the lack of established structure&#8208;performance relationships. Systematic and controlled material nanostructuring offers an innovative approach for advancement in catalyst design. Herein we discover low&#8208;valent manganese atoms stabilized on ceria, CeO2, as the first stable catalyst for NH3 oxidation to N2O, exhibiting two&#8208;fold higher productivity than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. Detailed mechanistic, computational and kinetic studies reveal CeO2 as the mediator of oxygen supply, while undercoordinated manganese species activate O2 and facilitate N2O evolution via N&#8208;N bond formation between nitroxyl, HNO, intermediates. Synthesis via simple impregnation of a small metal quantity (1&#160;wt.%) predominantly generates isolated manganese sites, while full atomic dispersion is achieved upon redispersion of sporadic oxide nanoparticles during reaction, as confirmed by advanced microscopic analysis and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Subsequently, manganese speciation is maintained, and no deactivation is observed over 70&#160;h on stream. CeO2&#8208;supported isolated transition metals emerge as a novel class of materials for N2O production, encouraging future studies to evaluate their potential in selective catalytic oxidations at large.

         <title>Programmed Self&#8208;Assembly of Single Colloidal Gyroid for Chiral Photonic Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Gyroid structures are of extensive interest because they provide a rich platform for chiroptics as well as topological photonics. While the double gyroid morphology as a bicontinuous structure is not uncommon in self&#8208;assembled soft materials, direct self&#8208;assembly of single network gyroid has proven elusive. Here, an enantiomorphic pair of single gyroid crystals comprising colloidal spheres is presented, and two distinct routes are demonstrated for programmed self&#8208;assembly of each single colloidal gyroid enantiomorph from rationally designed patchy spheres. The designer colloidal patchy spheres, which closely hew to their synthetic feasibility, are chiral, having either two staggered rectangular patches at opposite poles or four circular patches arranged in a well&#8208;defined geometry. The single colloidal gyroid, as well as its inverse structure, is shown to support a wide complete photonic band gap in addition to exhibiting rich chiroptical properties, making them attractive chiral photonic crystals. The versatility of this single colloidal gyroid, the bottom&#8208;up routes devised here in silico and the robustness of the design space for the chiral colloidal patchy spheres together make a strong case for single colloidal gyroid to supersede colloidal diamond, as a target for programmed self&#8208;assembly, in the quest for a photonic crystal operating at optical&#160;frequencies.

         <title>A Molecular Scale Understanding of Misorientation Toughening in Corals and Seashells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Biominerals are organic&#8208;mineral composites formed by living organisms. They are the hardest and toughest tissues in those organisms, are often polycrystalline, and their mesostructure (which includes nano&#8208; and micro&#8208;scale crystallite size, shape, arrangement, and orientation) can vary dramatically. Marine biominerals may be aragonite, vaterite, or calcite, all calcium carbonate (CaCO3) polymorphs, differing in crystal structure. Unexpectedly, diverse CaCO3 biominerals such as coral skeletons and nacre share a similar characteristic: adjacent crystals are slightly misoriented. We document this observation quantitatively at the micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;scales, using Polarization&#8208;dependent Imaging Contrast mapping (PIC mapping), and measure the slight misorientations to be consistently between 1&#176;&#8208;40&#176;. Nanoindentation shows that both polycrystalline biominerals and abiotic synthetic spherulites are tougher than single&#8208;crystalline geologic aragonite, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of bicrystals at the molecular scale reveals that aragonite, vaterite, and calcite exhibit toughness maxima when they are misoriented by 10&#176;, 20&#176;, and 30&#176;, respectively, demonstrating that slight misorientation alone can increase fracture toughness. Slight misorientation&#8208;toughening can be harnessed for synthesis of bioinspired materials that only require one material, are not limited to specific top&#8208;down architecture, and are easily achieved by self&#8208;assembly of organic molecules (e.g., aspirin, chocolate), polymers, metals, and ceramics well beyond biominerals.

Slight misorientation-toughening can be harnessed for synthesis of bioinspired materials that only require one material, are not limited to specific top-down architecture, and are easily achieved by self-assembly of organic molecules (e.g., aspirin, chocolate), polymers, metals, and ceramics well beyond biominerals.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Orbital Symmetry Engineering in Fused Polycyclic Heteroaromatics toward Extremely Narrowband Green Emissions with an FWHM of 13&#160;nm</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Multiresonance (MR) molecules generally face spectral broadening issues with red&#8208;shifted emissions. Thus, green emitters with full width at half maximums (FWHMs) of &lt;20&#160;nm are rarely reported, despite being highly desired. Herein, by properly fusing indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole (ICZ) and naphthalene moieties, we report on green MR emitters with FWHMs of merely 13&#160;nm (0.064&#160;eV) and 14&#160;nm (0.069&#160;eV) in dichloromethane, accompanied by high photoluminescence quantum yields of &gt;95%, which represent not only the smallest FWHMs among all green MR emitters but also the first green emitters based on ICZ MR derivatives. Theoretical studies reveal that the orbital interactions between the antisymmetric sites of the segments play an important role in extending the conjugation length in the fusion architectures while simultaneously maintaining a small FWHM. The corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) exhibit green emission peaks at 508&#8211;509&#160;nm and the first green electroluminescence FWHM of &lt;20&#160;nm ever reported. Benefiting from the preferential horizontal dipole orientation, a high maximum external quantum efficiency of up to 30.9% was obtained, which remained at 28.9% and 23.2% under luminances of 1,000&#160;cd/m2 and 10,000&#160;cd/m2, respectively, outperforming most reported green devices based on narrowband emitters.

         <title>Electrostatic epitaxy of orientational perovskites for microlasers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Orientational growth of single&#8208;crystalline structures is pivotal in semiconductor industry, which is achievable by epitaxy for producing thin films, heterostructures, quantum wells and superlattices. Beyond silicon and III&#8208;V semiconductors, solution&#8208;processible semiconductors, such as metal&#8208;halide perovskites, are emerging for scalable and cost&#8208;effective manufacture of optoelectronic devices, whereas the polycrystalline nature of fabricated structures restricts their application towards integrated devices. Here, we develop electrostatic epitaxy, a process sustained by strong electrostatic interactions between self&#8208;assembled surfactants (octanoate anions) and Pb2+, to realize orientational growth of single&#8208;crystalline CsPbBr3 microwires. Strong electrostatic interactions localized at air&#8208;liquid interface not only support preferential nucleation for single crystallinity, but also select the crystal facet with the highest Pb2+ areal density for pure crystallographic orientation. Due to the epitaxy at air&#8208;liquid interface, we realize direct growth of oriented single&#8208;crystalline microwires onto different substrates without the processes of lift&#8208;off and transfer. Photonic lasing emission, waveguide coupling and on&#8208;chip propagation of coherent light are demonstrated based on these single&#8208;crystalline microwires. Our findings open an avenue for on&#8208;chip integration of single&#8208;crystalline materials.

         <title>Recent Progress in Colloidal Quantum Dot Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Semiconducting colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) represent an emerging class of thermoelectric materials for use in a wide range of future applications. CQDs combine solution processability at low temperatures with the potential for upscalable manufacturing via printing techniques. Moreover, due to their low dimensionality, CQDs exhibit quantum confinement and a high density of grain boundaries, which can be independently exploited to tune the Seebeck coefficient and thermal conductivity, respectively. This unique combination of attractive attributes makes CQDs very promising for application in emerging thermoelectric generator (TEG) technologies operating near room temperature. Herein, we review recent progress in CQDs for application in emerging thin&#8208;film thermoelectrics. We start by outlining the fundamental concepts of thermoelectricity in nanostructured materials, followed by an overview of the popular synthetic methods used to produce CQDs with controllable size and shape. Recent strides in CQD&#8208;based thermoelectrics are then discussed with particular emphasis on their application in thin&#8208;film TEGs. Finally, we highlight the current challenges and future perspectives in enhancing the performance of CQD&#8208;based thermoelectric materials for use in emerging applications.

         <title>Dihydroxyterephthalate &#8211; a Trojan Horse PET Counit for Facile Chemical Recycling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Here we&#160;demonstrate low&#8208;energy PET chemical recycling in water: PET copolymers with diethyl 2,5&#8208;dihydroxyterephthalate (DHTE) undergo selective hydrolysis at DHTE sites, autocatalyzed by neighboring group participation (NGP). Liberated oligomeric subchains further hydrolyze until only small molecules remain. Poly(ethylene terephthalate&#8208;stat&#8208;2,5&#8208;dihydroxyterephthalate) (PEDHT) copolymers were&#160;synthesized via melt polycondensation and then hydrolyzed in 150&#8211;200 &#176;C water with 0&#8211;1 wt % ZnCl2, or alternatively in simulated sea water. Degradation progress followed pseudo&#8208;first order kinetics. With increasing DHTE loading, the rate constant increased monotonically while the thermal activation barrier decreased. The depolymerization products were&#160;ethylene glycol, terephthalic acid, 2,5&#8208;dihydroxyterephthalic acid, and bis(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl) terephthalate dimer, which could be used to regenerate virgin polymer. Composition&#8208;optimized copolymers showed a decrease of nearly 50% in the Arrhenius activation energy, suggesting a 6&#8208;order reduction in depolymerization time under ambient conditions compared to that of PET homopolymer. This study provides new insight to the design of polymers for end&#8208;of&#8208;life while maintaining key properties like service temperature and mechanical properties. Moreover, this chemical recycling procedure is more environmentally friendly compared to traditional approaches since water is the only needed material, which is green, sustainable, and&#160;cheap.

         <title>Electronic/Optoelectronic Memory Device Enabled by Tellurium&#8208;based 2D van der Waals Heterostructure for in&#8208;Sensor Reservoir Computing at the Optical Communication Band</title>

Abstract
Although two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials have been widely explored for data storage and neuromorphic computing, the construction of 2D material&#8208;based memory devices with optoelectronic responsivity in the short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) region for in&#8208;sensor reservoir computing (RC) at the optical communication band still remains a big challenge. In this work, we report an electronic/optoelectronic memory device enabled by tellurium&#8208;based 2D van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure, where the ferroelectric CuInP2S6 and tellurium channel endow this device with both the long&#8208;term potentiation/depression by voltage pulses and short&#8208;term potentiation by 1550&#8208;nm laser pulses (a typical wavelength in the conventional fiber optical communication band). Leveraging the rich dynamics, we demonstrate a fully memristive in&#8208;sensor RC system that can simultaneously sense, decode and learn messages transmitted by optical fibers. The reported 2D vdW heterostructure&#8208;based memory featuring both the long&#8208;term and short&#8208;term memory behaviors using electrical and optical pulses in SWIR region has not only complemented the wide spectrum of applications of 2D materials family in electronics/optoelectronics but also paves the way for future smart signal processing systems at the edge.

         <title>Water&#8208;Resistant Conductive gels toward Underwater Wearable Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Conductive gels have been developing vigorously as superior wearable sensing materials due to their intrinsic conductivity, softness, stretchability and biocompatibility, showing a great potential in many aspects of our lives. However, compared to their wide application on land, it is significant yet rather challenging for traditional conductive gels to realize sensing application under water. The swelling of gels and the loss of conductive components in the aqueous environment, resulted from the diffusion across the interface, lead to structural instability and sensing performance decline. Fortunately, great efforts have been devoted to improving the water resistance of conductive gels and employing them in the field of underwater wearable sensing in recent years, and some exciting achievements have been obtained, which are of great significance for promoting the safety and efficiency of underwater activities. However, there has been no review to thoroughly summarize the underwater sensing application of conductive gels. This review presents a brief overview of the representative design strategies for developing water&#8208;resistant conductive gels and their diversified applications in the underwater sensing field as wearable sensors. Finally, the ongoing challenges for further developing water&#8208;resistant conductive gels for underwater wearable sensing are also discussed along with recommendations for the future.

         <title>In Situ Transformable Nanoplatforms with Supramolecular Crosslinking Triggered Complementary Function for Enhanced Cancer Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In vivo crosslinking of nanoparticles is widely used to increase accumulation of therapeutic agents at tumor site for enhanced therapy. However, the components in nanoplatforms usually only play for one role and are independent of each other, unable to amplify their biofunctions. Herein, a complementary functioning tumor microenvironment triggered, supramolecular coordination induced nanoparticle crosslinking strategy is constructed for enhanced photodynamic therapy. Manganese oxide (MnOx) and polyhydroxy photosensitizer hypericin (Hyp) are coated and loaded onto lanthanide doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) to form transformable UCNP@MnOx&#8208;Hyp. In CT26 mouse colon cancer cells and xenograft tumors, UCNP@MnOx&#8208;Hyp is reduced by glutathione (GSH) and H2O2, releasing Mn2+ and Hyp for in situ crosslinking to transform to UCNP@Mn2+&#8208;Hyp. Compared to the simple photosensitizer loaded UCNP@PEI&#8208;Hyp, the Mn2+&#8208;Hyp coordination redshifts absorbance of hypericin and improves the energy transfer efficiency from UCNPs to Hyp (5.6&#8208;fold). In turn, the supramolecular coordination induced UCNPs crosslinking exhibits enhanced luminescence recovery and increased intracellular accumulation of both UCNPs and Hyp, thus enhancing the photodynamic therapy efficacy both at cellular level (2.1&#8208;fold) and in vivo, realizing the function amplification of each component after responsive transformation and offering a new avenue for enhanced cancer therapy.

Abstract
The sense of spiciness is related to the stimulation of vanilloid compounds contained in the foods. Although, the spiciness is commonly considered as the part of taste, it is more classified to the sense of pain stimulated on a tongue, namely, pungency, which is described as a tingling or burning on the tongue. Herein, w e firstly fabricated a reusable electronic tongue based on a TRPV1 nanodisc conjugated graphene field&#8208;effect transistor and demonstrated spiciness&#8208;related pain evaluation with reusable electrode. The pungent compound reactive receptor TRPV1 w as synthesized in the form of nanodiscs to maintain stability and reusability. O ur newly developed platform showed highly selective and sensitive performance towards each spiciness related vanilloid compound repeatably: 1 aM capsaicin, 10 aM dihydrocapsaicin, 1 fM piperine, 10&#160;nM allicin, and 1 pM AITC. The binding mechanism w as also examined by simulation. Furthermore, the elimination of the burning sensation on the tongue after eating spicy foods w as not investigated. Based on the synthesis of micelles composed of casein protein (which is contained in skim milk) that remove pungent compounds bound to TRPV1 nanodisc, the deactivation of TRPV1 w as investigated, and the electrode w as reusable that mimicking electronic tongue.

         <title>Engineering Pore Environments of Sulfate&#8208;pillared Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Efficient C2H2/CO2 Separation with Record Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Engineering pore environments exhibits great potential in improving gas adsorption and separation performances but requires specific means for acetylene/carbon dioxide (C2H2/CO2) separation due to their identical dynamic diameters and similar properties. Herein, we report a novel sulfate&#8208;pillared MOF adsorbent (SOFOUR&#8208;TEPE&#8208;Zn) using 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetra(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl) ethene (TEPE) ligand with dense electronegative pore surfaces. Compared to the prototype SOFOUR&#8208;1&#8208;Zn, SOFOUR&#8208;TEPE&#8208;Zn exhibits a higher C2H2 uptake (89.1 cm3 g&#8722;1), meanwhile the CO2 uptake reduces to 14.1 cm3 g&#8722;1, only 17.4% of that on SOFOUR&#8208;1&#8208;Zn (81.0 cm3 g&#8722;1). The high affinity toward C2H2 than CO2 is demonstrated by the benchmark C2H2/CO2 selectivity (16833). Furthermore, dynamic breakthrough experiments confirm its application feasibility and good cyclability at various flow rates. During the desorption cycle, 60.1 cm3 g&#8722;1 C2H2 of 99.5% purity or 33.2 cm3 g&#8722;1 C2H2 of 99.99% purity can be recovered by stepped purging and mild heating. The simulated pressure swing adsorption processes reveal that 75.5 cm3 g&#8722;1 C2H2 of 99.5+% purity with a high gas recovery of 99.82% can be produced in a counter&#8208;current blowdown process. Modeling studies disclose four favorable adsorption sites and dense packing for C2H2.

         <title>Discovery of Topological Magnetic Textures Near room Temperature in Quantum Magnet TbMn6Sn6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The study of topology in quantum materials has fundamentally advanced our understanding in condensed matter physics and potential applications in next&#8208;generation quantum information technology. Recently, the discovery of a topological Chern phase in the spin&#8208;orbit coupled Kagome lattice TbMn6Sn6 has attracted considerable interest. Whereas these phenomena highlight the contribution of momentum space Berry curvature and Chern gap on the electronic transport properties, less is known about the intrinsic real space magnetic texture, which is crucial for understanding the electronic properties and further exploring the unique quantum behavior. Here, we directly observe the stabilization of topological magnetic skyrmions in TbMn6Sn6 using Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (L&#8208;TEM) near room temperature, where the spins experience full spin reorientation transition (SRT) between the a and c axes. We construct an effective spin Hamiltonian based on the Ginzburg&#8208;Landau theory and perform micromagnetic simulation to clarify the critical role of Ruderman&#8208;Kittel&#8208;Kasuya&#8208;Yosida (RKKY) interaction on the stabilization of skyrmion lattice. Our results not only uncover non&#8208;trivially spin topological texture in TbMn6Sn6, but also provide a solid basis to study its interplay with electronic topology.
