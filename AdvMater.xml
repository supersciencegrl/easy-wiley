         <title>Vertically Stacked Full Color Quantum Dots Phototransistor Arrays for High&#8208;Resolution and Enhanced Color&#8208;Selective Imaging</title>

Abstract
Color&#8208;selective multi&#8208;functional and multiplexed photodetectors have attracted considerable interest with the increasing demand for color filter free optoelectronics which can simultaneously process multispectral signal via minimized system complexity. The low efficiency of color&#8208;filter technology and conventional laterally pixelated photodetector array structures often limit opportunities for widespread realization of high&#8208;density photodetectors. Here, we develop low&#8208;temperature solution&#8208;processed vertically stacked full color quantum dot (QD) phototransistor arrays on plastic substrates for high&#8208;resolution color&#8208;selective photosensor applications. Particularly, the three different&#8208;sized/color (RGB) QDs were vertically stacked and pixelated via direct photo&#8208;patterning using a unique chelating chalcometallate ligand functioning both as solubilizing component and, after photoexposure, a semiconducting cement creating robust, insoluble, and charge&#8208;efficient QD layers localized in the a&#8208;IGZO transistor region, resulting in efficient wavelength&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;induced charge transfer. Thus, high&#8208;resolution vertically stacked full color QD photodetector arrays were successfully implemented with the density of 5,500 devices cm&#8211;2 on ultrathin flexible polymeric substrates with highly photosensitive characteristics such as photoresponsivity (1.1&#215;104 AW&#8211;1) and photodetectivity (1.1&#215;1018 Jones) as well as wide dynamic&#8208;ranges (&gt; 150&#160;dB).

         <title>Uncommon Behavior of Li Doping Suppresses Oxygen Redox in P2&#8208;type Manganese&#8208;Rich Sodium Cathodes</title>

Abstract
Utilizing both cationic and anionic oxygen redox reactions is regarded as an important approach to exploit high&#8208;capacity layered cathode materials with earth abundant elements. It has been popular strategies to effectively elevate the oxygen redox activities by Li&#8208;doping to introduce unhybridized O 2p orbitals in NaxMnO2&#8208;based chemistries or enabling high covalency transition metals in P2&#8208;Na0.66MnxTM1&#8208;xO2 (TM = Fe, Cu, Ni) materials. Here, we investigated the effect of Li doping on regulating the oxygen redox activities P2&#8208;structured Na0.66Ni0.25Mn0.75O2 materials. Systematic X&#8208;ray characterizations and ab initio simulations have shown that the doped Li has uncommon behavior in modulating the density of states of the neighboring Ni, Mn and O, leading to the suppression of the existing oxygen and Mn redox reactivities and the promotion of the Ni redox. The findings provide a complementary scenario to current oxygen redox mechanisms and shed lights on developing new routes for high&#8208;performance cathodes.

         <title>Deterministic Shallow Dopant Implantation in Silicon with Detection Confidence Upper&#8208;Bound to 99.85% by Ion&#8208;Solid Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Silicon chips containing arrays of single dopant atoms could be the material of choice for both classical and quantum devices that exploit single donor spins. For example, group&#8208;V&#8208;donors implanted in isotopically purified 28Si crystals are attractive for large&#8208;scale quantum computers. Useful attributes include long nuclear and electron spin lifetimes of 31P, hyperfine clock transitions in 209Bi or electrically controllable 123Sb nuclear spins. Promising architectures require the ability to fabricate arrays of individual near&#8208;surface dopant atoms with high yield. Here we employ an on&#8208;chip detector electrode system with 70&#160;eV r.m.s. noise (&#8764;20 electrons) to demonstrate near room temperature implantation of single 14&#160;keV 31P+ ions. The physics model for the ion&#8208;solid interaction shows an unprecedented upper&#8208;bound single ion detection confidence of 99.85&#177;0.02% for near&#8208;surface implants. As a result, the practical controlled silicon doping yield is limited by materials engineering factors including surface gate oxides in which detected ions may stop. For a device with 6&#160;nm gate oxide and 14&#160;keV 31P+ implants we demonstrate a yield limit of 98.1%. Thinner gate oxides allow this limit to converge to the upper&#8208;bound. Deterministic single ion implantation can therefore be a viable materials engineering strategy for scalable dopant architectures in silicon&#160;devices.

         <title>A novel porous Ti&#8208;squarate as efficient photocatalyst in the overall water splitting reaction under simulated sunlight irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A new porous titanium(IV) squarate metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), denoted as IEF&#8208;11, having a never reported titanium secondary building unit has been successfully synthesized and fully characterized. IEF&#8208;11 not only exhibits a permanent porosity, but also an outstanding chemical stability. Further, as a consequence of combining the photoactive Ti(IV) and the electroactive squarate, IEF&#8208;11 presents relevant optoelectronic properties, applied here to the photocatalytic overall water splitting reaction. Remarkably, IEF&#8208;11 as a photocatalyst is able to produce record H2 amounts for MOF&#8208;based materials under simulated sunlight (up to 672 &#956;mol&#183;gcatalyst in 22 h) without any activity loss during at least 10 days.

         <title>Highly Selective and Sensitive Detection of Volatile Sulfur Compounds by Ionically Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High selectivity to specific analyte is essential for chemical sensors but difficult to achieve. For most chemical sensors, although the response to the target analyte can be more significant than interference analytes, they still show obvious responses to the interference analytes. Here we develop highly selective chemical sensors with negligible responses to other interference vapors. Instead of the widely investigated electronically conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (EC&#8208;MOFs), ionically conductive MOFs (IC&#8208;MOFs) are used as the sensing materials, and the unique interaction between the ion charge carrier and the analyte is utilized to achieve high sensing selectivity. Through the modulation of the metal nodes (Cu, Co, Ni, Zn, Mg) and organic ligands (H2TCPP, H2THPP, H4BTEC), sensor arrays based on a set of IC&#8208;MOF are fabricated and achieve highly selective detection toward volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs). H2S and CH3SH can be selectively detected at concentrations down to 1 ppb and 1&#160;ppm, respectively. The facile preparation and low cost endow the device with disposability. These results suggest new approaches for the development of highly selective chemical sensors.

         <title>Strain&#8208;enabled Phase Transition of Periodic Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Phase transitions are universal in solid&#8208;state matters, as well as in periodic electromagnetic metasurfaces &#8211; the photonic analogues of crystals. Although such transitions dictate the properties of active metasurfaces, universal ways to describe the structure transition of periodic metasurfaces have not yet been established. Here, we report the strain&#8208;enable phase transition (or lattice deformation) of stretchable metasurfaces with the crystallographic description. We analytically and experimentally demonstrate the phase transition of plasmonic lattices between two arbitrary two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Bravais lattices under certain strain configurations. The strain&#8208;induced symmetry lowering of the structures gives rise to optical anisotropy upon polarization, namely, linearly and circularly polarized dichroism. We further demonstrate the potential of phase transition in information decoding with applied strain. Interpreting the phase transition of metesurfaces from a standpoint of symmetry would accelerate the discovery of emergent properties, and provide a generalizable approach to designing active metasurfaces.

         <title>Amine Functionalized Carbon Nanodots Electrocatalysts Converting Carbon Dioxide to Methane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to methane (CH4), which can be used not only as fuel but also as a hydrogen carrier, has drawn great attention for use in supporting carbon capture and utilization. The design of active and selective electrocatalysts with exceptional CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion efficiency is highly desirable; however, it remains a challenge. Here we present a molecular tuning strategy&#8722;in&#8208;situ amine functionalization of nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene quantum dots (GQDs) for highly efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion. Amine functionalized nitrogen&#8208;doped GQDs achieve a CH4 Faradic efficiency (FE) of 63% and 46%, respectively, at CH4 partial current densities of 170 and 258&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, approximating to or even outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Cu&#8208;based catalysts. These GQDs also convert CO2 to C2 products mainly including C2H4 and C2H5OH with a maximum FE of &#8764;10%. A systematic analysis reveals that the CH4 yield varies linearly with amine group content, whereas the C2 production rate is positively dependent on pyridinic N dopant content. This work provides insight into the rational design of carbon catalysts with CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion efficiency at the industrially relevant level.

         <title>Stretchable Soft Composites with strain&#8208;induced Architectured Color</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Colors enable interaction and communication between living species in a myriad of biological and artificial environments. While living organisms feature low&#8208;power mechanisms to dynamically control color in soft tissues, man&#8208;made color&#8208;changing devices remain predominantly rigid and energy&#8208;intensive. Here, we report soft architectured composites that display striking color changes when stretched in selective directions under ambient light with minimum power input. The orientation&#8208;dependent color change results from the rotation of reflective coated platelets that are embedded in a soft polymer matrix and pre&#8208;aligned in a well&#8208;defined architecture. The light reflected by the platelets generates structural color defined by the oxide coating on the platelet surface. By magnetically programming the initial orientation and spatial distribution of selected platelets within the soft matrix, we create composites with strain&#8208;modulated color&#8208;changing effects that cannot be achieved using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art technologies. The proposed concept of strain&#8208;induced architectured color can be harnessed to develop low&#8208;power smart stretchable displays, tactile synthetic skins and autonomous soft robotic devices that undergo fast and reversible color changes through the mechano&#8208;optic coupling programmed within their soft composite architecture.

         <title>Interface&#8208;mediated Twinning&#8208;induced Plasticity in A Fine Hexagonal Microstructure Generated By Additive Manufacturing

Abstract
The grain size is a determinant microstructural feature to enable the activation of deformation twinning in hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) metals. Although deformation twinning is one of the most effective mechanisms for improving the strength&#8208;ductility trade&#8208;off of structural alloys, its activation is reduced with decreasing grain size. This work reports the discovery of the activation of deformation twinning in a fine&#8208;grained hcp microstructure by introducing ductile body&#8208;centered cubic (bcc) nano&#8208;layer interfaces. The fast solidification and cooling conditions of laser&#8208;based additive manufacturing are exploited to obtain a fine microstructure that, coupled with an intensified intrinsic heat treatment, permits to generate the bcc nano&#8208;layers. In situ high&#8208;energy synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction allows tracking the activation and evolution of mechanical twinning in real&#8208;time. The findings obtained show the potential of ductile nano&#8208;layering for the novel design of hcp damage tolerant materials with improved life spans.

         <title>Optimized colossal near&#8208;field thermal radiation enabled by manipulating coupled plasmon polariton geometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Collective optoelectronic phenomena such as plasmons and phonon polaritons can drive processes in many branches of nanoscale science. Classical physics predicts that a perfect thermal emitter operates at the black body limit. Numerous experiments have shown that surface phonon polaritons allow emission two orders of magnitude above the limit at a gap distance of &#8764; 50&#160;nm. This work shows that a supported multilayer graphene structure improves the state of the art by around one order of magnitude with a &#8764; 1129 fold&#8208;enhancement at a gap distance of &#8764; 55&#160;nm. Coupled surface plasmon polaritons at mid&#8208; and far&#8208;infrared frequencies allow for near&#8208;unity photon tunneling across a broad swath of k&#8208;space enabling the improved result. Electric tuning of the Fermi&#8208;level allows for the detailed characterization and optimization of the colossal nanoscale heat transfer.

         <title>Green Recycling Methods to Treat Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries E&#8208;Waste: A Circular Approach to Sustainability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emerging green recycling processes for spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) are covered here, including bioleaching, waste&#8208;for&#8208;waste, and electrochemical methods that employ environmentally friendly sustainable technologies. It also highlights methods to regenerate recovered elements from spent LIB. The circular economy approach toward closed&#8208;loop LIB recycling is elaborated through approaches to reprocess recovered elements into electrodes and reusing them to fabricate new LIBs.








Abstract
E&#8208;waste generated from end&#8208;of&#8208;life spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is increasing at a rapid rate owing to the increasing consumption of these batteries in portable electronics, electric vehicles, and renewable energy storage worldwide. On the one hand, landfilling and incinerating LIBs e&#8208;waste poses environmental and safety concerns owing to their constituent materials. On the other hand, scarcity of metal resources used in manufacturing LIBs and potential value creation through the recovery of these metal resources from spent LIBs has triggered increased interest in recycling spent LIBs from e&#8208;waste. State of the art recycling of spent LIBs involving pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy processes generates considerable unwanted environmental concerns. Hence, alternative innovative approaches toward the green recycling process of spent LIBs are essential to tackle large volumes of spent LIBs in an environmentally friendly way. Such evolving techniques for spent LIBs recycling based on green approaches, including bioleaching, waste for waste approach, and electrodeposition, are discussed here. Furthermore, the ways to regenerate strategic metals post leaching, efficiently reprocess extracted high&#8208;value materials, and reuse them in applications including electrode materials for new LIBs.

     alt="Green Recycling Methods to Treat Lithium-Ion Batteries E-Waste: A Circular Approach to Sustainability"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging green recycling processes for spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are covered here, including bioleaching, waste-for-waste, and electrochemical methods that employ environmentally friendly sustainable technologies. It also highlights methods to regenerate recovered elements from spent LIB. The circular economy approach toward closed-loop LIB recycling is elaborated through approaches to reprocess recovered elements into electrodes and reusing them to fabricate new LIBs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E-waste generated from end-of-life spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is increasing at a rapid rate owing to the increasing consumption of these batteries in portable electronics, electric vehicles, and renewable energy storage worldwide. On the one hand, landfilling and incinerating LIBs e-waste poses environmental and safety concerns owing to their constituent materials. On the other hand, scarcity of metal resources used in manufacturing LIBs and potential value creation through the recovery of these metal resources from spent LIBs has triggered increased interest in recycling spent LIBs from e-waste. State of the art recycling of spent LIBs involving pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy processes generates considerable unwanted environmental concerns. Hence, alternative innovative approaches toward the green recycling process of spent LIBs are essential to tackle large volumes of spent LIBs in an environmentally friendly way. Such evolving techniques for spent LIBs recycling based on green approaches, including bioleaching, waste for waste approach, and electrodeposition, are discussed here. Furthermore, the ways to regenerate strategic metals post leaching, efficiently reprocess extracted high-value materials, and reuse them in applications including electrode materials for new LIBs. The concept of &#8220;circular economy&#8221; is highlighted through closed-loop recycling of spent LIBs achieved through green-sustainable approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intracellular Condensates of Oligopeptide for Targeting Lysosome and Addressing Multiple Drug Resistance of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lysosome selective construction of biomolecular hydrogel with emerging biological functions provides a novel strategy for controlling cancer cell fates by inducing lysosomal&#8208;membrane permeabilization and addressing multidrug resistance in a tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model.








Abstract
Biomolecular condensates have been demonstrated as a ubiquitous phenomenon in biological systems and play a crucial role in controlling cellular functions. However, the spatiotemporal construction of artificial biomolecular condensates with functions remains challenging and has been less explored. Herein, a general approach is reported to construct biomolecular condensates (e.g., hydrogel) in the lysosome of living cells for cancer therapy and address multiple drug resistance induced by lysosome sequestration. Aromatic&#8208;motif&#8208;appended pH&#8208;responsive hexapeptide (LTP) derived from natural insulin can be uptaken by cancer cells mainly through caveolae&#8208;dependent endocytosis, ensuring the proton&#8208;triggered phase transformation (solution to hydrogel) of LTP inside the lysosome specifically. Lysosomal hydrogelation further leads to enlargement of the lysosome in cancer cells and increases the permeability of the lysosome, resulting in cancer cell death. Importantly, lysosomal assemblies can significantly improve the efficiency of current chemotherapy drugs toward multidrug resistance (MDR) cells in vitro and in xenograft tumor models. As an example of functional artificial condensates in lysosomes, this work provides a new strategy for controlling functional condensates formation precisely in the organelles of living cells and addressing MDR in cancer therapy.

         <title>Self&#8208;Supporting 3D Carbon Nitride with Tunable n &#8594; &#960;* Electronic Transition for Enhanced Solar Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;supporting 3D (SSD) polymeric carbon nitride (PCN), with tunable n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transition, is successfully synthesized via a facile stepwise pyrolytic strategy. The synergistic optimization of the SSD structure and n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transition in PCN significantly advance the exciton dissociation and optical absorption, leading to enhanced visible&#8208;light H2 evolution activity in the spectral region above 500&#160;nm.








Abstract
Self&#8208;supporting 3D (SSD) carbon nitrides (UCN&#8208;X, X&#160;= 600&#8211;690; where X represents the pyrolytic temperature) consisting of curved layers, with plenty of wrinkles and enlarged size, are synthesized via a facile stepwise pyrolytic strategy. Such unique features of the SSD structure exhibiting dramatically improved charge mobility, extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated aromatic system, and partial distortion of heptazine&#8208;based skeleton can not only keep the easier activation of the intrinsic &#960;&#160;&#8594; &#160;&#960;* electronic transition but also awaken the n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transition in carbon nitride. The n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transition of UCN&#8208;X can be controllably tuned through changing the pyrolytic temperature, which can greatly extend the photoresponse range to 600&#160;nm. More importantly, the change regularity of H2 evolution rates is highly positive, correlated with the change tendency of n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transition in UCN&#8208;X, suggesting the positive contribution of n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transition to enhancing photocatalytic activity. The UCN&#8208;670, with optimal structural and optical properties, presents enhanced H2 evolution rate up to 9230&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 (Pt 1.1 wt%). This work realizes the synergistic optimization of optical absorption and exciton dissociation via fabricating an SSD structure. It offers a new strategy for the development of novel carbon nitride materials for efficient photocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Elastomeric Nanodielectrics for Soft and Hysteresis&#8208;Free Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elastomeric nanodielectrics are fabricated by the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of oppositely charged polyurethanes in aqueous solutions, showing high area capacitances, low leakage currents, high humidity immunity, and low densities of charge traps. These robust nanodielectrics are demonstrated in stretchable capacitors and flexible low&#8208;voltage and hysteresis&#8208;free field&#8208;effect transistors with uniform performance and fatigue resistance.








Abstract
Elastomeric dielectrics are crucial for reliably governing the carrier densities in semiconducting channels during deformation in soft/stretchable field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). Uncontrolled stacking of polymeric chains renders elastomeric dielectrics poorly insulated at nanoscale thicknesses, thereby thick films are usually required, leading to high voltage or power consumption for on/off operations of FETs. Here, layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly is exploited to build 15&#8208;nm&#8208;thick elastomeric nanodielectrics through alternative adsorption of oppositely charged polyurethanes (PUs) for soft and hysteresis&#8208;free FETs. After mild thermal annealing to heal pinholes, such PU multilayers offer high areal capacitances of 237&#160;nF cm&#8722;2 and low leakage current densities of 3.2 &#215; 10&#8722;8 A cm&#8722;2 at 2&#160;V. Owing to the intrinsic ductility of the elastomeric PUs, the nanofilms possess excellent dielectric properties at a strain of 5% or a bending radius of 1.5&#160;mm, while the wrinkled counterparts show mechanical stability with negligible changes of leakage currents after repeated stretching to a strain of 50%. Besides, these nanodielectrics are immune to high humidity and conserve their properties when immersed into water, despite their assembly occurs aqueously. Furthermore, the PU dielectrics are implemented in carbon nanotube FETs, demonstrating low&#8208;voltage operations (&lt; 1.5&#160;V) and negligible hysteresis without any encapsulations.

         <title>Unraveling Strain Gradient Induced Electromechanical Coupling in Twisted Double Bilayer Graphene Moir&#233; Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intrinsic flexoelectricity in twisted double bilayer graphene moir&#233; superlattices is presented. First, threefold symmetric polarizations are predicated based on density function theory and finite element analysis. Then, strain gradient induced polarizations are captured by piezoelectric force microscopy at room temperature with superior resolution. Finally, the 180&#176; phase change is determined using vector analysis which matches well with theoretical predication.








Abstract
Moir&#233; superlattices of 2D materials with a small twist angle are thought to exhibit appreciable flexoelectric effect, though unambiguous confirmation of their flexoelectricity is challenging due to artifacts associated with commonly used piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). For example, unexpectedly small phase contrast (&#8776;8&#176;) between opposite flexoelectric polarizations is reported in twisted bilayer graphene (tBG), though theoretically predicted value is 180&#176;. Here a methodology is developed to extract intrinsic moir&#233; flexoelectricity using twisted double bilayer graphene (tDBG) as a model system, probed by lateral PFM. For small twist angle samples, it is found that a vectorial decomposition is essential to recover the small intrinsic flexoelectric response at domain walls from a large background signal. The obtained threefold symmetry of commensurate domains with significant flexoelectric response at domain walls is fully consistent with the theoretical calculations. Incommensurate domains in tDBG with relatively large twist angles can also be observed by this technique. A general strategy is provided here for unraveling intrinsic flexoelectricity in van der Waals moir&#233; superlattices while providing insights into engineered symmetry breaking in centrosymmetric materials.

         <title>2D Molecular Sheets of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Ultrastable Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional molecular sheets of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks are prepared using diaminotriazole linkers to form multi&#8208;site hydrogen bonds. The product has excellent chemical stability and diminished solubility in common organic solvents, and can enable superstable sodium ion storage for 10,000 cycles.








Abstract
There has been growing research interest in hydrogen bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) by virtue of their great structural crystallinity, large surface areas and porosity. Their potential in electrochemical applications, unfortunately, remains elusive because weak hydrogen bonds would dissociate in solution that eventually compromises the structural integrity. Herein, it is demonstrated that this issue may be overcome by designing and introducing multisite hydrogen bonding within HOFs. 2D molecular sheets are prepared using diaminotriazole as the linkers for the first time. In spite of the molecular thickness (&#8776;1 nm), they are chemically stable and mechanically robust, and have diminished solubility in most polar or nonpolar organic solvents. This solution&#8208;stable HOF exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance for Na+ ion storage. In particular, it enables an exceptional cycle life of &gt;10&#160;000 cycles at 1 A g&#8208;1, which is far superior to most other organic electrode materials. Theoretical simulations indicate that the activation barrier for the intralayer or interlayer diffusion of Na+ ions within the organic frameworks is small.

Gradient alloyed CdSe/ZnxCd1&#8722;xS/ZnS and CdSe/CdS/ZnS core/shell/shell quantum&#8208;rod downconverters showing high&#8208;efficacy light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) covering a wide color gamut are reported. The engineered shell thickness suppresses energy transfer and Auger recombination and maintains the high quantum yield in the solid&#8208;state (81%). These LEDs show luminous efficacy of 149&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1 and wide color gamut.








Abstract
Efficient white light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with an efficacy of 200&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1 are much desirable for lighting and displays. The phosphor&#8208;based LEDs in use today for display applications offer poor color saturation. Intensive efforts have been made to replace the phosphor with quantum&#8208;dot&#8208;based downconverters, but the efficiency and stability of these devices are still in their infancy. Quantum rods (QRs), nanoparticles with an elongated shape, show superior properties such as relatively larger Stokes shifts, polarized emission, and high light out&#8208;coupling efficiency in the solid&#8208;state. However, these QRs usually suffer from poor optical quality for PL wavelengths &lt;&#160;550&#160;nm. Herein, a gradient alloyed CdSe/ZnxCd1&#8722;xS/ZnS and CdSe/CdS/ZnS core/shell/shell QR downconverters showing high efficacy LEDs covering a wide color gamut are reported. These QRs show high stability and a precisely tunable photoluminescence peak. The engineered shell thickness suppresses energy transfer and thus maintains the high quantum yield in the solid&#8208;state (81%). These QR&#8208;based LEDs attain an efficacy of 149&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1 (@10mA) and&#160;wide color gamut (118% NTSC), which is exceedingly higher than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum dots and phosphor&#8208;based on&#8208;chip LEDs.

         <title>Quinoxaline&#8208;Based D&#8211;A Copolymers for the Applications as Polymer Donor and Hole Transport Material in Polymer/Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments of the quinoxaline&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymers for the applications as polymer donor in polymer solar cells and as hole transport material in perovskite solar cells are reviewed.








Abstract
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have achieved great progress recently, benefiting from the rapid development of narrow bandgap small molecule acceptors and wide bandgap conjugated polymer donors. Among the polymer donors, the D&#8211;A copolymers with quinoxaline (Qx) as A&#8208;unit have received increasing attention since the report of the low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance D&#8211;A copolymer donor based on thiophene D&#8208;unit and difluoro&#8208;quinoxalline A&#8208;unit in 2018. In addition, the weak electron&#8208;deficient characteristic and the multiple substitution positions of the Qx unit make it an ideal A&#8208;unit in constructing the wide bandgap polymer donors with different functional substitutions. In this review article, recent developments of the Qx&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymer donors, including synthetic method of the Qx unit, backbone modulation, side chain optimization, and functional substitution of the Qx&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymers, are summarized and discussed. Furthermore, the application of the Qx&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymers as hole transport material in perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) is also introduced. The focus mainly on the molecular design strategies and structure&#8211;properties relationship of the Qx&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymers, aiming to provide a guideline for developing high&#8208;performance Qx&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymers for the applications as donor in PSCs and as hole transport material in pero&#8208;SCs.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Red Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on One&#8208;Step&#8208;Formed &#947;&#8208;CsPbI3 Cuboid Crystallites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile one&#8208;step method to in situ deposit &#947;&#8208;phase 3D CsPbI3 films consisting of cuboid crystallites is achieved by introducing 1,3&#8208;propanediamine dihydriodide (PDAI). The PDAI&#8208;perovskite light&#8208;emitting diode (PeLED) can reach a record efficiency of 15.03% for 3D CsPbI3 PeLEDs and a peak efficiency of 10.30% of a 9 cm2 PeLED.








Abstract
Inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite with high chemical stability is attractive for efficient deep&#8208;red perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with high color purity. Compared to PeLEDs based on ex&#8208;situ&#8208;synthesized CsPbI3 nanocrystals/quantum dots suffering from low conductivity and efficiency droop under high current densities, in situ deposited 3D CsPbI3 films from precursor solutions can maintain high conductivity but show high trap density. Here, it is demonstrated that introducing diammonium iodide can increase the size of colloids in the precursor solution, retard the phase&#8208;transition rate, and passivate trap states of the in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed cuboid crystallites. The PeLED based on the one&#8208;step&#8208;formed 3D CsPbI3 cuboid crystallite films shows a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) value up to 15.03% because of the high conductivity and reduced trap states. Furthermore, this one&#8208;step method also has a wide processing window, which is attractive for flow&#8208;line production of large&#8208;area PeLED modules. The fabrication of a 9 cm2 PeLED that exhibits a peak EQE of 10.30% is successfully demonstrated.

         <title>Microbially Catalyzed Biomaterials for Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Urease&#8208;producing haloalkalophilic&#160;bacteria can be used as biocatalyst adhered to the surface of bioceramics to form a biomineral layer: urea as the substrate is converted to carbonate by bacterial catalysis, and the subsequently increased CO32&#8722; reacts with the Ca2+ existing around the bacterial cells, leading to the formation of micro/nanostructures on the biomaterials. The newly generated micro/nanostructures facilitated by bacteria promote bone&#8208;forming bioactivity.








Abstract
Bone is a complex mineralized tissue composed of various organic (proteins, cells) and inorganic (hydroxyapatite, calcium carbonate) substances with micro/nanoscale structures. To improve interfacial bioactivity of bone&#8208;implanted biomaterials, extensive efforts are being made to fabricate favorable biointerface via surface modification. Inspired by microbially catalyzed mineralization, a novel concept to biologically synthesize the micro/nanostructures on bioceramics, microbial&#8208;assisted catalysis, is presented. It involves three processes: bacterial adhesion on biomaterials, production of CO32&#8722; assisted by bacteria, and nucleation and growth of CaCO3 nanocrystals on the surface of bioceramics. The microbially catalyzed biominerals exhibit relatively uniform micro/nanostructures on the surface of both 2D and 3D &#945;&#8208;CaSiO3 bioceramics. The topographic and chemical cues of the grown micro/nanostructures present excellent in vitro and in vivo bone&#8208;forming bioactivity. The underlying mechanism is closely related to the activation of multiple biological processes associated with bone regeneration. The study offers a microbially catalytic concept and strategy of fabricating micro/nanostructured biomaterials for tissue regeneration.

         <title>A Bioinspired Adhesive&#8208;Integrated&#8208;Agent Strategy for Constructing Robust Gas&#8208;Sensing Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An adhesive&#8208;integrated&#8208;agent strategy enabled by integrating the adhesive unit with the gas&#8208;sensing unit into one chemistry entity for constructing ultra&#8208;robust gas sensors to essentially solve the challenge of sensor stability at the molecular level is proposed. The fabricated sensors possess extremely strong interfacial adhesion and efficient gas sensitivity for outputting stable and reliable sensing signals even under harsh conditions.








Abstract
Gas sensors based on organic molecules are attractive for their tailored molecular structures and controllable functions, but weak interfacial adhesion between sensing materials and supporting substrates has severely hampered their practical applications, particularly in harsh environments. Here, inspired by the combined anchoring&#8208;recognizing feature of natural olfactory systems, an adhesive&#8208;integrated&#8208;agent strategy to integrate the adhesive unit (poly(dimethylsiloxane)) with the sensing unit (organoplatinum(II)) into one chemistry entity, creating robust and sensitive nanobelt array gas sensors is demonstrated. Systematic theoretical and experimental studies reveal that incorporating adhesive units significantly enhances the interfacial adhesion of the array sensors and gas&#8208;bridged super&#8208;exchange electronic couplings of sensing units ensure their efficient gas&#8208;sensing performance. The high shear strength of &#8776;7.05 &#215; 106 N m&#8722;2 allows these arrays to resist aggressive ultrasonication, tape peeling, or repeated bending without compromising their sensing performance. This molecular engineering strategy opens a new guideline to develop robust gas sensors.

         <title>Rippling Ferroic Phase Transition and Domain Switching In 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ripples are strongly coupled with ferroic orders in 2D ferroics. Take monolayer ferroelectric&#8208;ferroelastic GeSe as an example, it is shown that rippling ferroic phase transition and domain switching can render ultrahigh piezoelectric performance over a broad temperature range in 2D materials. It provides valuable guidance for ripple engineering in 2D materials with potential applications in 2D flexible electronics.








Abstract
Ripples are a class of native structural defects widely existing in 2D materials. They originate from the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane flexibility of 2D materials introducing spatially evolving electronic structure and friction behavior. However, the effect of ripples on 2D ferroics has not been reported. Here a molecular dynamics study of the effect of ripples on the temperature&#8208;induced ferroic phase transition and stress&#8208;induced ferroic domain switching in ferroelastic&#8208;ferroelectric monolayer GeSe is presented. Ripples stabilize the short&#8208;range ferroic orders in the high&#8208;temperature phase with stronger ferroicity and longer lifetime, thereby increasing the transition temperature upon cooling. In addition, ripples significantly affect the domain switching upon loading, changing it from a highly correlated process into a ripple&#8208;driven localized one where ripples act as source of dynamical random stress. These results reveal the fundamental role of ripples on 2D ferroicity and provide theoretical guidance for ripple engineering of controlled phase transition and domain switching with potential applications in flexible 2D electronics.

         <title>Utilizing the Built&#8208;in Electric Field of p&#8211;n Junctions to Spatially Propel the Stepwise Polysulfide Conversion in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel hierarchical and defect&#8208;rich Co3O4/TiO2 p&#8211;n junctions with built&#8208;in electric field are designed as the host materials of sulfur electrodes for Li&#8211;S batteries. The elaborate p&#8211;n junctions not only induce the directional migration of lithium polysulfides to suppress the dissolution of sulfur intermediates into the electrolyte but also implement the spatially sequential catalysis to ensure the superior utilization of sulfur.








Abstract
Integrating sulfur cathodes with effective catalysts to accelerate polysulfide conversion is a suitable way for overcoming the serious shuttling and sluggish conversion of polysulfides in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. However, because of the sharp differences in the redox reaction kinetics and complicated phase transformation of sulfur, a single&#8208;component catalyst cannot consistently accelerate the entire redox process. Herein, hierarchical and defect&#8208;rich Co3O4/TiO2 p&#8211;n junctions (p&#8208;Co3O4/n&#8208;TiO2&#8208;HPs) are fabricated to implement the sequential catalysis of S8(solid)&#160;&#8594; Li2S4(liquid)&#160;&#8594; Li2S(solid). Co3O4 sheets physiochemically immobilize the pristine sulfur and ensure the rapid reduction of S8 to Li2S4, while TiO2 dots realize the effective precipitation of Li2S, bridged by the directional migration of polysulfides from p&#8208;type Co3O4 to n&#8208;type TiO2 attributed to the interfacial built&#8208;in electric field. As a result, the sulfur cathode coupled with p&#8208;Co3O4/n&#8208;TiO2&#8208;HPs delivers long&#8208;term cycling stability with a low capacity decay of 0.07% per cycle after 500 cycles at 10 C. This study demonstrates the synergistic effect of the built&#8208;in electric field and heterostructures in spatially enhancing the stepwise conversion of polysulfides, which provides novel insights into the interfacial architecture for rationally regulating the polysulfide redox reactions.

         <title>A Morphologically Stable Li/Electrolyte Interface for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries Enabled by 3D&#8208;Micropatterned Garnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Morphological degradation at the Li/solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) interface is a prevalent issue causing performance fading of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.

Abstract
Morphological degradation at the Li/solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) interface is a prevalent issue causing performance fading of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). To maintain the interfacial integrity, most ASSBs are operated under low current density with considerable stack pressure, which significantly limits their widespread usage. Herein, a novel 3D&#8208;micropatterned SSE (3D&#8208;SSE) that can stabilize the morphology of the Li/SSE interface even under relatively high current density and limited stack pressure is reported. Under the pressure of 1.0&#160;MPa, the Li symmetric cell using a garnet&#8208;type 3D&#8208;SSE fabricated by laser machining shows a high critical current density of 0.7&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 and stable cycling over 500 h under 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8211;2. This excellent performance is attributed to the reduced local current density and amplified mechanical stress at the Li/3D&#8208;SSE interface. These two effects can benefit the flux balance between Li stripping and creep at the interface, thereby preventing interfacial degradation such as void formation and dendrite growth.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morphological degradation at the Li/solid-state electrolyte (SSE) interface is a prevalent issue causing performance fading of all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs). To maintain the interfacial integrity, most ASSBs are operated under low current density with considerable stack pressure, which significantly limits their widespread usage. Herein, a novel 3D-micropatterned SSE (3D-SSE) that can stabilize the morphology of the Li/SSE interface even under relatively high current density and limited stack pressure is reported. Under the pressure of 1.0&#160;MPa, the Li symmetric cell using a garnet-type 3D-SSE fabricated by laser machining shows a high critical current density of 0.7&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt; and stable cycling over 500 h under 0.5&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This excellent performance is attributed to the reduced local current density and amplified mechanical stress at the Li/3D-SSE interface. These two effects can benefit the flux balance between Li stripping and creep at the interface, thereby preventing interfacial degradation such as void formation and dendrite growth.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spacer Cation Alloying in Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskites for Efficient Red Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Precisely Tunable Wavelengths</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and general strategy of spacer cation alloying is developed to modulate the thickness distribution of quantum wells in Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskite films. Based on this method, efficient perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes with tunable emissions between pure red (626&#160;nm) and deep red (671&#160;nm) are achieved with peak external quantum efficiencies up to 11.5%.








Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have recently shown significant progress with external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) exceeding 20%. However, PeLEDs with pure&#8208;red (620&#8722;660&#160;nm) light emission, an essential part for full&#8208;color displays, remain a great challenge. Herein, a general approach of spacer cation alloying is employed in Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites (RPPs) for efficient red PeLEDs with precisely tunable wavelengths. By simply tuning the alloying ratio of dual spacer cations, the thickness distribution of quantum wells in the RPP films can be precisely modulated without deteriorating their charge&#8208;transport ability and energy funneling processes. Consequently, efficient PeLEDs with tunable emissions between pure red (626&#160;nm) and deep red (671&#160;nm) are achieved with peak EQEs up to 11.5%, representing the highest values among RPP&#8208;based pure&#8208;red PeLEDs. This work opens a new route for color tuning, which will spur future developments of pure&#8208;red or even pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs with high performance.

         <title>Ionic Covalent Organic Frameworks for Energy Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic covalent organic frameworks (iCOFs) are porous crystalline polymeric materials where the backbone is composed of 100% covalent bonds and on which ionic groups are functionalized. iCOFs can transport ions rapidly and reliably through the pores. Thus, they are ideal materials for solid electrolytes. Examples proved iCOFs showed excellent performance to make all&#8208;solid&#8208;state and single&#8208;ion conducting Li&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a class of porous crystalline materials whose facile preparation, functionality, and modularity have led to their becoming powerful platforms for the development of molecular devices in many fields of (bio)engineering, such as energy storage, environmental remediation, drug delivery, and catalysis. In particular, ionic COFs (iCOFs) are highly useful for constructing energy devices, as their ionic functional groups can transport ions efficiently, and the nonlabile and highly ordered all&#8208;covalent pore structures of their backbones provide ideal pathways for long&#8208;term ionic transport under harsh electrochemical conditions. Here, current research progress on the use of iCOFs for energy devices, specifically lithium&#8208;based batteries and fuel cells, is reviewed in terms of iCOF backbone&#8208;design strategies, synthetic approaches, properties, engineering techniques, and applications. iCOFs are categorized as anionic COFs or cationic COFs, and how each of these types of iCOFs transport lithium ions, protons, or hydroxides is illustrated. Finally, the current challenges to and future opportunities for the utilization of iCOFs in energy devices are described. This review will therefore serve as a useful reference on state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art iCOF design and application strategies focusing on energy devices.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Co2&#8211;N6 and Fe&#8211;N4 Costructures Boost Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Both Alkaline and Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ternary&#8208;atom electrocatalyst, in which atomically dispersed Co2&#8211;N6 and Fe&#8211;N4 sites are coanchored on N&#8208;doped carbon hosts (derived from reaction with ZIF&#8208;8), is synthesized. Synergistic effect is explicitly unraveled that induces higher filling degree of Fe&#8211;d orbitals and outstanding oxygen reduction reaction activity in both alkaline and acidic media.








Abstract
Polynary transition&#8208;metal atom catalysts are promising to supersede platinum (Pt)&#8208;based catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Regulating the local configuration of atomic catalysts is the key to catalyst performance enhancement. Different from the previously reported single&#8208;atom or dual&#8208;atom configurations, a new type of ternary&#8208;atom catalyst, which consists of atomically dispersed, nitrogen&#8208;coordinated Co&#8211;Co dimers, and Fe single sites (i.e., Co2&#8211;N6 and Fe&#8211;N4 structures) that are coanchored on highly graphitized carbon supports is developed. This unique atomic ORR catalyst outperforms the catalysts with only Co2&#8211;N6 or Fe&#8211;N4 sites in both alkaline and acid conditions. Density functional theory calculations clearly unravels the synergistic effect of the Co2&#8211;N6 and Fe&#8211;N4 sites, which can induce higher filling degree of Fe&#8211;d orbitals and favors the binding capability to *OH intermediates (the rate determining step). This ternary&#8208;atom catalyst may be a promising alternative to Pt to drive the cathodic ORR in zinc&#8211;air batteries.

         <title>Light&#8208;Motivated SnO2/TiO2 Heterojunctions Enabling the Breakthrough in Energy Density for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoaccelerated rechargeable lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) employing SnO2/TiO2 heterojunction nanoarrays as a multifunctional anode is demonstrated. The lithiation kinetics and reversibility are greatly enhanced, leading to 1.8 times increase in areal specific capacity without attenuation even for 100 cycles. This finding exhibits a feasible pathway to break the energy density of LIBs by conversion and storage of solar energy.








Abstract
Powering lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) by light&#8208;irradiation will bring a paradigm shift in energy&#8208;storage technologies. Herein, a photoaccelerated rechargeable LIB employing SnO2/TiO2 heterojunction nanoarrays as a multifunctional anode is developed. The electron&#8211;hole pairs generated by the LixTiO2 (x&#160;&#8805; 0) under light irradiation synergistically enhance the lithiation kinetics and electrochemical reversibility of both SnO2 and TiO2. Specifically, the electrons can quickly pour into the SnO2 and the generated Sn due to the more positive conduction band potentials (vs TiO2), and mean while the holes also promote the intercalation of Li+ into TiO2 by reaching charge balance. A remarkable increase in areal specific capacity is therefore achieved from 1.91 to 3.47 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. More impressively, there is no capacity loss even through 100 cycles, which is the best report for photorechargeable LIBs to date, owing to the strong and stable photoresponse current. This finding exhibits a feasible pathway to break the limitation in the energy density of LIBs by the efficient conversion and storage of solar energy.

         <title>Conjugated Polyelectrolytes: Underexplored Materials for Pseudocapacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated polyelectrolytes are characterized by an electronically delocalized backbone bearing ionic functionalities. These features lead to properties relevant for use in energy&#8208;storing pseudocapacitor devices, including ionic conductivity, water processability, gel formation, and formation of polaronic species stabilized by electrostatic interactions. Moreover, that conjugated polyelectrolytes are miscible in aqueous media enables living materials that can switch from energy production to energy storage.








Abstract
Conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) are characterized by an electronically delocalized backbone bearing ionic functionalities. These features lead to properties relevant for use in energy&#8208;storing pseudocapacitor devices, including ionic conductivity, water processability, gel&#8208;formation, and formation of polaronic species stabilized by electrostatic interactions. In this Perspective, the basis for evaluating the figures of merit for pseudocapacitors is provided, together with the techniques used for their evaluation. The general utility and challenges encountered with neutral conjugated polymers are then discussed. Finally, recent advances on the use of CPEs in pseudocapacitor devices are reviewed. The article is concluded by discussing how their miscibility in aqueous media permits the incorporation of CPEs in living materials that are capable of switching function from extraction of energy from bacterial metabolic pathways to pseudocapacitor energy storage.

         <title>Dynamically Tuneable Reflective Structural Coloration with Electroactive Conducting Polymer Nanocavities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemically tuneable structural coloration is demonstrated based on an optical cavity with a conducting polymer based on thienothiophene as electroactive spacer layer. Synergistic effects of optical properties and thickness changes enable low voltage tuning of the structural color across the whole visible range with high and similar reflectance for all the redox states.








Abstract
Dynamic control of structural colors across the visible spectrum with high brightness has proven to be a difficult challenge. Here, this is addressed with a tuneable reflective nano&#8208;optical cavity that uses an electroactive conducting polymer (poly(thieno[3,4&#8208;b]thiophene)) as spacer layer. Electrochemical doping and dedoping of the polymer spacer layer provides reversible tuning of the cavity's structural color throughout the entire visible range and beyond. Furthermore, the cavity provides high peak reflectance that varies only slightly between the reduced and oxidized states of the polymer. The results indicate that the polymer undergoes large reversible thickness changes upon redox tuning, aided by changes in optical properties and low visible absorption. The electroactive cavity concept may find particular use in reflective displays, by opening for tuneable monopixels that eliminate limitations in brightness of traditional subpixel&#8208;based systems.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc Batteries Based on Organic/Organic Cathodes Integrating Multi&#8208;Redox Centers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic cathode materials with redox&#8208;active sites and flexible structure are promising for developing aqueous zinc ion batteries with high capacity and large output power. However, the energy storage of most organic hosts relies on the coordination/incoordination reaction between Zn2+/H+ and a single functional group, which result in the inferior capacity, low discharge platform, and structural instability. Here, we take the lead in in&#8208;situ electrodepositing stable poly(1,5&#8208;naphthalenediamine, 1,5&#8208;NAPD) as interlayer and excellent conductive poly(para&#8208;aminophenol, pAP) skin onto nanoporous carbon in sequence for the structural optimization of organic/organic cathodes, designated as C@multi&#8208;layer polymer. In&#8208;situ analyses, electrochemical measurements, and theoretical calculation prove that both C = O and C = N active groups can display the strong electron donor as well as Zn2+ host during the discharging process. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the double organic layers, C@multi&#8208;layer polymer delivers with high capacity, long lifespan, and excellent capacity reservation even at large discharge current and commercial mass loading (&gt; 10&#160;mg cm&#8208;2). Introducing multi redox centers into one organic composites will provide new insights into designing advanced Zn&#8208;organic batteries.

         <title>Developing the non&#8208;developable: Creating curved&#8208;surface electronics from non&#8208;stretchable devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The incorporation of electronics onto curved surfaces promises to bring new levels of intelligence to the ergonomic, aesthetic, aerodynamic, and optical surfaces that are ever&#8208;present in our lives. However, since many of these surfaces have two&#8208;dimensional (i.e., non&#8208;developable) curvature, they cannot be formed from the deformation of a flat non&#8208;stretchable sheet. This means that curved electronics cannot capitalize on the rapid technological advances taking place in the field of ultrathin electronics, since ultrathin devices, though ultra&#8208;flexible, are not stretchable. In this work, we present a shrink&#8208;based paradigm to apply such thin&#8208;film electronics to non&#8208;developable surfaces, expanding the capabilities of current non&#8208;developable electronics, and linking future developments in thin&#8208;film technology to similar developments in curved devices. We examine the wrinkling of parylene&#8208;based devices and the effects of shrinkage on common electrical components, culminating in shrinkable touch sensors and organic photovoltaics, laminated to various non&#8208;developable surfaces without loss of performance.

         <title>Fe3O4/Ag/Bi2MoO6 Photoactivatable Nanozyme for Self&#8208;replenishing and Sustainable Cascaded Nanocatalytic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Catalytic cancer therapy based on nanozymes has recently attracted much interest. But the types of the current nanozymes are limited and their efficiency is usually compromised and not sustainable in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Therefore, combination therapy involving additional therapeutics is often necessary and the resulting complication may jeopardize the practical feasibility. Herein, an unprecedented &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; Fe3O4/Ag/Bi2MoO6 nanoparticle (FAB NP) is rationally devised to achieve synergistic chemodynamic, photodynamic, photothermal therapy with guidance by magnetic resonance, photoacoustic, and photothermal imaging. Based on its manifold nanozyme activities (mimicking peroxidase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione oxidase) and photodynamic property, cascaded nanocatalytic reactions are enabled and sustained in TME for outstanding therapeutic outcomes. The working mechanisms underlying the intraparticulate interactions, sustainability, and self&#8208;replenishment arising from the coupling between the nanocatalytic reactions and nanozyme activities are carefully revealed, providing new insights into the design of novel nanozymes for nanocatalytic therapy with high efficiency, good specificity, and low side effects.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Harsh&#8208;Environment&#8208;Resistant GaOX Solar&#8208;Blind Photodetectors via Defect and Doping Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Gallium oxide (Ga2O3), with an ultrawide bandgap, is currently regarded as one of the most promising materials for solar&#8208;blind photodetectors (SBPDs), which are greatly demanded in harsh environment, such as the situations of space exploration and flame prewarning. However, realization of high&#8208;performance SBPDs with high tolerance towards harsh environments based on low&#8208;cost Ga2O3 material faces great challenges. Here, defect and doping (DD) engineering towards amorphous GaOX (a&#8208;GaOX) has been proposed to obtain ultrasensitive SBPDs for harsh condition application. Serious oxygen deficiency and doping compensation of the engineered a&#8208;GaOX film ensure the high response currents and low dark currents, respectively. Annealing item in nitrogen of DD engineering also incurs the recrystallization of material, formation of nanopores by oxygen escape, and suppression of sub&#8208;bandgap defect states. As a result, the tailored GaOX SBPD based on DD engineering not only harvests a record&#8208;high responsivity rejection ratio (R254 nm/R365 nm) of 1.8&#215;107, 102 times higher detectivity, and 2&#215;102 times faster decay speed than the control device, but also keeps a high responsivity, high photo&#8208;to&#8208;dark current ratio, and sharp imaging capability even at high temperature (280&#176;C) or high bias (100&#160;V). The proposed DD engineering provides an effective strategy towards highly harsh&#8208;environment&#8208;resistant GaOX SBPDs.

Here, defect and doping (DD) engineering towards amorphous GaO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; (a-GaO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;) has been proposed to obtain ultrasensitive SBPDs for harsh condition application. Serious oxygen deficiency and doping compensation of the engineered a-GaO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; film ensure the high response currents and low dark currents, respectively. Annealing item in nitrogen of DD engineering also incurs the recrystallization of material, formation of nanopores by oxygen escape, and suppression of sub-bandgap defect states. As a result, the tailored GaO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; SBPD based on DD engineering not only harvests a record-high responsivity rejection ratio (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;254 nm&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;365 nm&lt;/sub&gt;) of 1.8&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; times higher detectivity, and 2&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; times faster decay speed than the control device, but also keeps a high responsivity, high photo-to-dark current ratio, and sharp imaging capability even at high temperature (280&#176;C) or high bias (100&#160;V). The proposed DD engineering provides an effective strategy towards highly harsh-environment-resistant GaO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; SBPDs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Solid&#8211;Liquid Host&#8211;Guest Composites: The Marriage of Porous Solids and Functional Liquids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8211;liquid host&#8211;guest composites have featured the ease of fabrication, long&#8208;term stability, and a broad spectrum of unprecedented properties, which cannot be fully met by conventional solid&#8211;solid composites or liquid&#8211;liquid composites. They have greatly evolved in a myriad of emerging applications. With new concepts in mind and persistent efforts, new functions and applications of the solid&#8211;liquid host&#8211;guest composites will appear.








Abstract
Composite materials can provide remarkable improvements over the individual constituents. Especially, with a liquid component introduced into a solid porous host, solid&#8211;liquid host&#8211;guest composites have recently come to the forefront with exceptional functions that promise them for a wealth of applications. Combining the unprecedented dynamic, transparent, omniphobic, self&#8208;healing, diffusive and adaptive nature of functional liquid with inherent solid host's property, solid&#8211;liquid host&#8211;guest composites can realize the ease of fabrication, long&#8208;term stability, and a broad spectrum of enhanced properties, which cannot be fully met by conventional solid&#8211;solid composites or liquid&#8211;liquid composites. This review presents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress in solid&#8211;liquid host&#8211;guest composites. Initially, the concept, classification, design strategy, as well as fabrication methods as a path forward to develop the composites are unraveled, and further it is elaborated on how the functionality of porous solid and functional liquid can be harnessed to create composites with a broad range of unique properties, especially, the optical, thermal, electric, mechanical, sorption, and separation properties. With these fascinating properties, a myriad of emerging applications such as optical devices, thermal management, electromagnetic&#8208;interference shielding, soft electronics, gas capture and release, and multiphase separations are touched upon, inspiring more frontier researches in materials science, interfacial chemistry, membrane science, engineering, and multidisciplinary. Finally, this review provides the perspective on the future directions of solid&#8211;liquid host&#8211;guest composites and assesses the challenges and opportunities ahead.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Dependent Intermediate Adsorption Modulation on Iridium&#8208;Modified Black Phosphorus Electrocatalysts for Efficient pH&#8208;Universal Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient iridium&#8208;modified 2D black phosphorus electrocatalyst is rationally designed to achieve the desired adsorption energies toward catalytic intermediates, and the resultant catalyst demonstrates outstanding pH&#8208;universal water splitting performances, surpassing the commercially dominate catalysts. Furthermore, an interesting surface&#8208;dependent activity enhancement mechanism is identified.








Abstract
2D black phosphorus (BP) is one promising electrocatalyst toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysis. The too strong adsorption of oxygen intermediates during OER, while the too weak adsorption of hydrogen intermediate during HER, however, greatly compromise its practical water splitting applications with overpotentials as high as 450&#160;mV for OER and 420&#160;mV for HER to achieve 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 under alkaline conditions. Herein, by rationally introducing the nanosized iridium (Ir) modifier together with optimized exposing surface toward electrolytes, an efficient Ir&#8208;modified BP electrocatalyst with much favorable adsorption energies toward catalytic intermediates possesses an outstanding pH&#8208;universal water splitting performance, surpassing the nearly all reported BP&#8208;based catalysts and the commercial noble&#8208;metal catalysts. The Ir&#8208;modified BP catalyst with the optimized exposed surfaces only requires an overall cell voltage of 1.54 and 1.57&#160;V to achieve 10 mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in acidic and alkaline electrolysers, respectively. This design uncovers the potential applications of 2D BP in practical electrocatalysis fields via decreasing reaction intermediate adsorption energy barriers and promoting the interfacial electron coupling for heterostructured catalysts, and offers new insights into the surface&#8208;dependent activity enhancement mechanism.

         <title>Advanced Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care Testing Technologies for Human Acute Respiratory Virus Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advanced rapid point&#8208;of&#8208;care tests (POCTs), including nucleic acid amplification, optical POCTs, electrochemistry, lateral flow assay, microfluidics, ELISA, and microarray&#8208;based platforms, act figuratively as the Great Wall to the widespread transmission of acute respiratory virus infections by enabling early and rapid detection of these pathogens, as is the case during the current pandemic.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;growing global threats to human life caused by the human acute respiratory virus (RV) infections have cost billions of lives, created a significant economic burden, and shaped society for centuries. The timely response to emerging RVs could save human lives and reduce the medical care burden. The development of RV detection technologies is essential for potentially preventing RV pandemic and epidemics. However, commonly used detection technologies lack sensitivity, specificity, and speed, thus often failing to provide the rapid turnaround times. To address this problem, new technologies are devised to address the performance inadequacies of the traditional methods. These emerging technologies offer improvements in convenience, speed, flexibility, and portability of point&#8208;of&#8208;care test (POCT). Herein, recent developments in POCT are comprehensively reviewed for eight typical acute respiratory viruses. This review discusses the challenges and opportunities of various recognition and detection strategies and discusses these according to their detection principles, including nucleic acid amplification, optical POCT, electrochemistry, lateral flow assays, microfluidics, enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assays, and microarrays. The importance of limits of detection, throughput, portability, and specificity when testing clinical samples in resource&#8208;limited settings is emphasized. Finally, the evaluation of commercial POCT kits for both essential RV diagnosis and clinical&#8208;oriented practices is included.

         <title>Ischemic Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Therapeutics for Cardiovascular Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ischemic microenvironment (IME)&#8208;responsive therapeutic modalities are defined in the present review. Fundamental principles and basic features of ischemic microenvironment are overviewed. Promising ischemic microenvironment&#8208;responsive therapeutic strategies are introduced and summarized. Perspectives toward the clinical practices based on the ischemic microenvironment&#8208;responsive biomaterials are outlooked.








Abstract
Cardiovascular diseases caused by ischemia are attracting considerable attention owing to its high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although numerous agents with cardioprotective benefits have been identified, their clinical outcomes are hampered by their low bioavailability, poor drug solubility, and systemic adverse effects. Advances in nanoscience and nanotechnology provide a new opportunity to effectively deliver drugs for treating ischemia&#8208;related diseases. In particular, cardiac ischemia leads to a characteristic pathological environment called an ischemic microenvironment (IME), significantly different from typical cardiac regions. These remarkable differences between ischemic sites and normal tissues have inspired the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive systems for the targeted delivery of therapeutic drugs to damaged cardiomyocytes. Recently, many biomaterials with intelligent properties have been developed to enhance the therapeutic benefits of drugs for the treatment of myocardial ischemia. Strategies for stimuli&#8208;responsive drug delivery and release based on IME include reactive oxygen species, pH&#8208;, hypoxia&#8208;, matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;, and platelet&#8208;inspired targeting strategies. In this review, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art IME&#8208;responsive biomaterials for the treatment of myocardial ischemia are summarized. Perspectives, limitations, and challenges are also discussed for the further development of innovative and effective approaches to treat ischemic diseases with high effectiveness and biocompatibility.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Palladium&#8208;Based Nanocrystals with Different Crystal Phases and a Comparison of Their Catalytic Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
There is a strong interest in developing phase&#8208;controlled metal nanocrystals to enhance their catalytic activity. Herein, template&#8208;directed growth is used to synthesize Ru@Pd nanocrystals with the Pd shells in either an fcc or hcp phase, and their catalytic properties are compared.








Abstract
A relatively unexplored aspect of noble&#8208;metal nanomaterials is polymorphism, or their ability to crystallize in different crystal phases. Here, a method is reported for the facile synthesis of Ru@Pd core&#8211;shell nanocrystals featuring polymorphism, with the core made of hexagonally close&#8208;packed (hcp)&#8208;Ru while the Pd shell takes either an hcp or face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) phase. The polymorphism shows a dependence on the shell thickness, with shells thinner than &#8776;1.4&#160;nm taking the hcp phase whereas the thicker ones revert to fcc. The injection rate provides an experimental knob for controlling the phase, with one&#8208;shot and drop&#8208;wise injection of the Pd precursor corresponding to fcc&#8208;Pd and hcp&#8208;Pd shells, respectively. When these nanocrystals are tested as catalysts toward formic acid oxidation, the Ru@Pdhcp nanocrystals outperform Ru@Pdfcc in terms of both specific activity and peak potential. Density functional theory calculations are also performed to elucidate the origin of this performance enhancement.

         <title>Superior High&#8208;Temperature Strength in a Supersaturated Refractory High&#8208;Entropy Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural materials with exceptional high&#8208;temperature strengths are highly desirable for high&#8208;temperature applications. Here, three alloy&#8208;design principles of the large atomic&#8208;size and elastic&#8208;modulus mismatches, the insensitive temperature&#8208;dependence of elastic properties, and the dominance of non&#8208;screw dislocations are used to design a CrMoNbV refractory high&#8208;entropy alloy, which exhibits outperforming high&#8208;temperature strengths.








Abstract
Refractory high&#8208;entropy alloys (RHEAs) show promising applications at high temperatures. However, achieving high strengths at elevated temperatures above 1173K is still challenging due to heat softening. Using intrinsic material characteristics as the alloy&#8208;design principles, a single&#8208;phase body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (BCC) CrMoNbV RHEA with high&#8208;temperature strengths (beyond 1000&#160;MPa at 1273 K) is designed, superior to other reported RHEAs as well as conventional superalloys. The origin of the high&#8208;temperature strength is revealed by in situ neutron scattering, transmission&#8208;electron microscopy, and first&#8208;principles calculations. The CrMoNbV's elevated&#8208;temperature strength retention up to 1273 K arises from its large atomic&#8208;size and elastic&#8208;modulus mismatches, the insensitive temperature dependence of elastic constants, and the dominance of non&#8208;screw character dislocations caused by the strong solute pinning, which makes the solid&#8208;solution strengthening pronounced. The alloy&#8208;design principles and the insights in this study pave the way to design RHEAs with outstanding high&#8208;temperature strength.

         <title>Synergistic Enzyme Mixtures to Realize Near&#8208;Complete Depolymerization in Biodegradable Polymer/Additive Blends</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When enzymes with deep, narrow active sites are embedded inside of plastics, chain&#8208;end&#8208;mediated processive depolymerization is realized. However, polymer additives can induce bending in crystalline lamellae, which causes chain ends to preferentially segregate at the crystal/amorphous interface where they are inaccessible for enzyme binding. Synergistic enzyme mechanisms can be exploited to create new chain ends and facilitate near&#8208;complete depolymerization.








Abstract
Embedding catalysts inside of plastics affords accelerated chemical modification with programmable latency and pathways. Nanoscopically embedded enzymes can lead to near&#8208;complete degradation of polyesters via chain&#8208;end mediated processive depolymerization. The overall degradation rate and pathways have a strong dependence on the morphology of semicrystalline polyesters. Yet, most studies to date focus on pristine polymers instead of mixtures that contain additives and other components despite their nearly universal use in plastic production. Here, additives are introduced to purposely change the morphology of polycaprolactone (PCL) by increasing the bending and twisting of crystalline lamellae. These morphological changes immobilize chain ends preferentially at the crystalline/amorphous interfaces and limit chain&#8208;end accessibility by the embedded processive enzyme. This chain&#8208;end redistribution reduces the polymer&#8208;to&#8208;monomer conversion from &gt;95%&#160;to less than 50%, causing formation of highly crystalline plastic pieces, including microplastics. By synergizing both random chain scission and processive depolymerization, it is feasible to navigate morphological changes in polymer/additive blends and to achieve near&#8208;complete depolymerization. The random scission enzymes in the amorphous domains create new chain ends that are subsequently bound and depolymerized by processive enzymes. Present studies further highlight the importance to consider how the host polymer's morphologies affect the reactions catalyzed by embedded catalytic species.

         <title>N&#8208;Type Surface Design for p&#8208;Type CZTSSe Thin Film to Attain High Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An n&#8208;type surface is realized successfully on the p&#8208;type CZTSSe thin film by controlling the Ag distribution using Ag2ZnSnS4/Al2O3/CZTS precursors. The photo&#8208;generated charge collection is improved and the interface recombination is suppressed, thus significantly improving the conversion efficiency of the CZTSSe solar cells.








Abstract
As a low&#8208;cost substitute that uses no expensive rare&#8208;earth elements for the high&#8208;efficiency Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 solar cell, the Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) solar cell has borrowed optimization strategies used for its predecessor to improve its device performance, including a profiled band gap and surface inversion. Indeed, there have been few reports of constructing CZTSSe absorber layers with surface inversion to improve efficiency. Here, a strategy that designs the CZTSSe absorber to attain surface modification by using n&#8208;type Ag2ZnSnS4 is demonstrated. It has been discovered that Ag plays two major roles in the kesterite thin film devices: surface inversion and front gradient distribution. It has not only an excellent carrier transport effect and reduced probability of electron&#8208;hole recombination but also results in increased carrier separation by increasing the width of the depletion region, leading to much improved VOC and JSC. Finally, a champion CZTSSe solar cell renders efficiency as high as 12.55%, one of the highest for its type, with the open&#8208;circuit voltage deficit reduced to as low as 0.306&#160;V (63.2% Shockley&#8208;Queisser limit). The band engineering for surface modification of the absorber and high efficiency achieved here shine a new light on the future of the CZTSSe solar cell.

         <title>High&#8208;Speed Fabrication of All&#8208;Inkjet&#8208;Printed Organometallic Halide Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes on Elastic Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inkjet&#8208;printing approaches are used to fabricate flexible organometallic halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes on elastic substrates from the bottom anode to the top cathode under ambient conditions. The fabrication time is significantly shortened by at least tenfold. The device has a novel simplified 4&#8208;layer structure without conventional electron&#8208; and hole&#8208;transport&#8208;layer, but still exhibiting extremely high performance even under aggressive bending tests.








Abstract
Halide perovskites have great potential for use in high&#8208;performance light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) and displays. Here, a perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) fabricated directly on an elastomer substrate, in which every single layer in the device from bottom anode to top cathode is patterned solely using a highly scalable inkjet printing process, is reported. Compared to PeLEDs made using conventional microfabrication processes, the printing process significantly shortens the fabrication time by at least tenfold (from over 5 h to less than 25 min). The all&#8208;printed PeLEDs have a novel 4&#8208;layer structure (bottom electrode, perovskite emissive layer, buffer layer, top electrode) without separate electron or hole transporting layers. For flexible PeLEDs printed directly in ambient conditions, a turn&#8208;on voltage, maximum luminance intensity, and maximum current efficiency of 3.46&#160;V, 10227&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, and 2.01&#160;cd&#160;A&#8722;1, respectively, is achieved. The devices also exhibit excellent robustness and stability even when bent to a curvature radius of 2.5&#160;mm. The reported device structure and fabrication processes can enable high&#8208;performance flexible PeLEDs to be manufactured over a larger area at extremely low cost and fast speed, which can facilitate the adoption of the promising PeLED technology in the emerging foldable displays, smart wearables, and many other applications.

     alt="High-Speed Fabrication of All-Inkjet-Printed Organometallic Halide Perovskite Light-Emitting Diodes on Elastic Substrates"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inkjet-printing approaches are used to fabricate flexible organometallic halide perovskite light-emitting diodes on elastic substrates from the bottom anode to the top cathode under ambient conditions. The fabrication time is significantly shortened by at least tenfold. The device has a novel simplified 4-layer structure without conventional electron- and hole-transport-layer, but still exhibiting extremely high performance even under aggressive bending tests.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halide perovskites have great potential for use in high-performance light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and displays. Here, a perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) fabricated directly on an elastomer substrate, in which every single layer in the device from bottom anode to top cathode is patterned solely using a highly scalable inkjet printing process, is reported. Compared to PeLEDs made using conventional microfabrication processes, the printing process significantly shortens the fabrication time by at least tenfold (from over 5 h to less than 25 min). The all-printed PeLEDs have a novel 4-layer structure (bottom electrode, perovskite emissive layer, buffer layer, top electrode) without separate electron or hole transporting layers. For flexible PeLEDs printed directly in ambient conditions, a turn-on voltage, maximum luminance intensity, and maximum current efficiency of 3.46&#160;V, 10227&#160;cd&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and 2.01&#160;cd&#160;A&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, is achieved. The devices also exhibit excellent robustness and stability even when bent to a curvature radius of 2.5&#160;mm. The reported device structure and fabrication processes can enable high-performance flexible PeLEDs to be manufactured over a larger area at extremely low cost and fast speed, which can facilitate the adoption of the promising PeLED technology in the emerging foldable displays, smart wearables, and many other applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Antipulverization and High&#8208;Continuity Lithium Metal Anode for High&#8208;Energy Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An antipulverization and high&#8208;continuity lithium metal anode comprising a small number of solid&#8208;state electrolyte nanoparticles as conformal/sacrificial fillers and a copper foil as supporting current collector is proposed to improve the lithium electrode stability and extend the cyclability of batteries.








Abstract
Lithium metal is one of the most promising anode candidates for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy batteries. Nevertheless, lithium pulverization and associated loss of electrical contact remain significant challenges. Here, an antipulverization and high&#8208;continuity lithium metal anode comprising a small number of solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) nanoparticles as conformal/sacrificial fillers and a copper (Cu) foil as the supporting current collector is reported. Guiding by the SSE, this new anode facilitates lithium nucleation, contributing to form a roundly shaped, micro&#8208;sized, and dendrite&#8208;free electrode during cycling, which effectively mitigates the lithium dendrite growth. The embedded Cu current collector in the hybrid anode not only reinforces the mechanical strength but also improves the efficient charge transfer among active lithium filaments, affording good electrode structural integrity and electrical continuity. As a result, this antipulverization and high&#8208;continuity lithium anode delivers a high average Coulombic efficiency of &#8776;99.6% for 300 cycles under a current density of 1 mA cm&#8722;2. Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (elemental sulfur or sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathodes) equipped with this anode show high&#8208;capacity retentions in their corresponding ether&#8208;based or carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes, respectively. This new electrode provides important insight into the design of electrodes that may experience large volume variation during operations.

         <title>Conductive CuCo&#8208;Based Bimetal Organic Framework for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conductive bimetal&#8208;based catecholate (CAT) nanorod arrays show excellent hydrogen evolution reaction activities in both alkaline and neutral electrolyte, comparable to that of the benchmark Pt/C. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the incorporation of Co not only optimize the &#916;GH* and the adsorption energy of water (&#916;EH2O) of Cu&#8208;CAT, but also increase the electrical conductivity of Cu&#8208;CAT.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with intrinsically porous structures and well&#8208;dispersed metal sites are promising candidates for electrocatalysis; however, the catalytic efficiencies of most MOFs are significantly limited by their impertinent adsorption/desorption energy of intermediates formed during electrocatalysis and very low electrical conductivity. Herein, Co is introduced into conductive Cu&#8208;catecholate (Cu&#8208;CAT) nanorod arrays directly grown on a flexible carbon cloth for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Electrochemical results show that the Co&#8208;incorporated Cu&#8208;CAT nanorod arrays only need 52 and 143&#160;mV overpotentials to drive a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline and neutral media for HER, respectively, much lower than most of the reported non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts and comparable to the benchmark Pt/C electrocatalyst. Density functional theory calculations show that the introduction of Co can optimize the adsorption energy of hydrogen (&#916;GH*) of Cu sites, almost close to that of Pt (111). Furthermore, the adsorption energy of water (&#916;EH2O) of Co sites in the CuCo&#8208;CAT is significantly lower than that of Cu sites upon coupling Cu with Co, effectively accelerating the Volmer step in the HER process. The findings, synergistic effect of bimetals, open a new avenue for the rational design of highly efficient MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts.

         <title>Fe&#8208;Ion Bolted VOPO4&#8729;2H2O as an Aqueous Fe&#8208;Ion Battery Electrode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron ion batteries are promising for grid energy storage due to their low cost and compatibility with aqueous electrolytes. This work demonstrates vanadium oxyphosphate as a capable cathode to host Fe2+. Vanadium oxyphosphate exhibits structural stability favoring Fe2+ to Zn2+ due to the bolting effect by the pre&#8208;intercalated Fe3+ before battery cycling.








Abstract
Iron ion batteries using Fe2+ as a charge carrier have yet to be widely explored, and they lack high&#8208;performing Fe2+ hosting cathode materials to couple with the iron metal anode. Here, it is demonstrated that VOPO4&#8729;2H2O can reversibly host Fe2+ with a high specific capacity of 100 mAh g&#8722;1 and stable cycling performance, where 68% of the initial capacity is retained over 800 cycles. In sharp contrast, VOPO4&#8729;2H2O's capacity of hosting Zn2+ fades precipitously over tens of cycles. VOPO4&#8729;2H2O stores Fe2+ with a unique mechanism, where upon contacting the electrolyte by the VOPO4&#8729;2H2O electrode, Fe2+ ions from the electrolyte get oxidized to Fe3+ ions that are inserted and trapped in the VOPO4&#8729;2H2O structure in an electroless redox reaction. The trapped Fe3+ ions, thus, bolt the layered structure of VOPO4&#8729;2H2O, which prevents it from dissolution into the electrolyte during (de)insertion of Fe2+. The findings offer a new strategy to use a redox&#8208;active ion charge carrier to stabilize the layered electrode materials.

         <title>Multifunctional Macroassembled Graphene Nanofilms with High Crystallinity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly crystalline macroassembled graphene nanofilms prepared by a camphor&#8208;assisted cooling&#8211;contraction strategy show excellent physical properties and advantages in high&#8208;performance electronic and optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
A &#8220;cooling&#8211;contraction&#8221; method to separate large&#8208;area (up to 4.2&#160;cm in lateral size) graphene oxide (GO)&#8208;assembled films (of nanoscale thickness) from substrates is reported. Heat treatment at 3000&#160;&#176;C of such free&#8208;standing macroscale films yields highly crystalline &#8220;macroassembled graphene nanofilms&#8221; (nMAGs) with 16&#8211;48&#160;nm thickness. These nMAGs present tensile strength of 5.5&#8211;11.3&#160;GPa (with &#8776;3&#160;&#181;m gauge length), electrical conductivity of 1.8&#8211;2.1 MS m&#8722;1, thermal conductivity of 2027&#8211;2820 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, and carrier relaxation time up to &#8776;23&#160;ps. As a demonstration application, an nMAG&#8208;based sound&#8208;generator shows a 30 &#181;s response and sound pressure level of 89&#160;dB at 1 W cm&#8722;2. A THz metasurface fabricated from nMAG has a light response of 8.2% for 0.159 W mm&#8722;2 and can detect down to 0.01&#160;ppm of glucose. The approach provides a straightforward way to form highly crystallized graphene nanofilms from low&#8208;cost GO sheets.

These nMAGs present tensile strength of 5.5&#8211;11.3&#160;GPa (with &#8776;3&#160;&#181;m gauge length), electrical conductivity of 1.8&#8211;2.1 MS m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, thermal conductivity of 2027&#8211;2820 W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and carrier relaxation time up to &#8776;23&#160;ps. As a demonstration application, an nMAG-based sound-generator shows a 30 &#181;s response and sound pressure level of 89&#160;dB at 1 W cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. A THz metasurface fabricated from nMAG has a light response of 8.2% for 0.159 W mm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and can detect down to 0.01&#160;ppm of glucose. The approach provides a straightforward way to form highly crystallized graphene nanofilms from low-cost GO sheets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Managing Growth and Dimensionality of Quasi 2D Perovskite Single&#8208;Crystalline Flakes for Tunable Excitons Orientation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Centimeter&#8208;sized quasi 2D&#8208;perovskites with tunable number of inorganic layers are synthesized by an innovative synthetic approach based on the use of a reactant, potassium iodide, that can modulate the supersaturation levels of the perovskite precursors solution without being part of the final products. Excitons orientation is changed from &#8220;in&#8208;plane&#8221; to &#8220;out&#8208;of&#8208;plane&#8221; by increasing the &#8220;n&#8221; value.








Abstract
Hybrid perovskites are among the most promising materials for optoelectronic applications. Their 2D crystalline form is even more interesting since the alternating inorganic and organic layers naturally forge a multiple quantum&#8208;well structure, leading to the formation of stable excitonic resonances. Nevertheless, a controlled modulation of the quantum well width, which is defined by the number of inorganic layers (n) between two organic ones, is not trivial and represents the main synthetic challenge in the field. Here, a conceptually innovative approach to easily tune n in lead iodide perovskite single&#8208;crystalline flakes is presented. The judicious use of potassium iodide is found to modulate the supersaturation levels of the precursors solution without being part of the final products. This allows to obtain a fine tuning of the n value. The excellent optical quality of the as synthesized flakes guarantees an in&#8208;depth analysis by Fourier&#8208;space microscopy, revealing that the excitons orientation can be manipulated by modifying the number of inorganic layers. Excitonic out&#8208;of&#8208;plane component, indeed, is enhanced when &#8220;n&#8221; is increased. The combined advances in the synthesis and optical characterization fill in the picture of the exciton behavior in low&#8208;dimensional perovskite, paving the way to the design of materials with improved optoelectronic characteristics.

         <title>The importance of surface adsorbates in solution&#8208;processed thermoelectric materials: the case of SnSe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solution synthesis of particles emerged as an alternative to prepare thermoelectric materials with less demanding processing conditions than conventional solid&#8208;state synthetic methods. However, solution synthesis generally involves the presence of additional molecules or ions belonging to the precursors or added to enable solubility and/or regulate nucleation and growth. These molecules or ions can end up in the particles as surface adsorbates and interfere in the material properties. This work demonstrates that ionic adsorbates, in particular Na&#8314; ions, are electrostatically adsorbed in SnSe particles synthesized in water and play a crucial role not only in directing the material nano/microstructure but also in determining the transport properties of the consolidated material. In dense pellets prepared by sintering SnSe particles, Na&#160;remains within the crystal lattice as dopant, in dislocations, precipitates, and forming grain boundary complexions. These results highlight the importance of considering all the possible unintentional impurities to establish proper structure&#8208;property relationships and control material properties in solution&#8208;processed thermoelectric materials.

         <title>Tin Halide Perovskites: From Fundamental Properties to Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal halide perovskites have unique optical and electrical properties, which make them an excellent class of materials for a broad spectrum of optoelectronic applications. However, it is with photovoltaic devices that this class of materials has reached the apotheosis of popularity, and is the massive interests of a large community of researchers that has led to a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.5% only after 10 years from their first use. Nevertheless, such high performance is achieved with Pb&#8208;based compounds, which are toxic to the environment. Therefore, in the last years a considerable research effort has been focused to substitute Pb with other less toxic group IVA metals. Sn&#8208;based perovskites are the most promising alternative because of their band&#8208;gap close to the optimal value for photovoltaic applications, the strong optical absorption, and the good charge carrier mobilities. Nevertheless, the low defect tolerance, the fast crystallization, and the oxidative instability of tin halide perovskites has confined till now the power conversion efficiency to much lower values of the one obtained with Pb&#8208;based perovskites. We believe that fundamental understanding of the electronic properties and of the film formation process is imperative to bring Sn&#8208;based devices at the level of Pb&#8208;based one. With this review we aim to give a detailed overview of the crystallographic, photophysical, and optoelectronic properties of Sn&#8208;based perovskite compounds in their multiple forms from the 3D systems till low dimensional structures. At the end, recent progresses in Sn&#8208;based perovskite solar cells are reviewed, mainly focusing on the detail of the strategies adopted to improve the device performances. For each sub&#8208;topic the current challenges and the outlook are discussed, with the aim to stimulate the community to address the most important issues in a concerted manner.

         <title>Enzymatically Transformable Polymersome&#8208;Based Nanotherapeutics to Eliminate Minimal Relapsable Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzymatically transformable nanotherapeutics is presented to improve the targeted delivery of old drugs&#8212;MMP inhibitor and colchicine&#8212;into minimal relapsable cancer. This distinct combination therapy not only ensures direct killing of residual cancer cells but also disrupts the premetastatic microenvironment to prevent distant seeding/outgrowth, which radically reduces metastatic and local&#8208;regional recurrence after surgery.








Abstract
Prevention of metastatic and local&#8208;regional recurrence of cancer after surgery remains difficult. Targeting postsurgical premetastatic niche and microresiduals presents an excellent prospective opportunity but is often challenged by poor therapeutic delivery into minimal residual tumors. Here, an enzymatically transformable polymer&#8208;based nanotherapeutic approach is presented that exploits matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) overactivation in tumor&#8208;associated tissues to guide the codelivery of colchicine (microtubule&#8208;disrupting and anti&#8208;inflammatory agent) and marimastat (MMP inhibitor). The dePEGylation of polymersomes catalyzed by MMPs not only exposes the guanidine moiety to improve tissue/cell&#8208;targeting/retention to increase bioavailability, but also differentially releases marimastat and colchicine to engage their extracellular (MMPs) and intracellular (microtubules) targets of action, respectively. In primary tumors/overt metastases, the vasculature&#8208;specific targeting of nanotherapeutics can function synchronously with the enhanced permeability and retention effect to deter malignant progression of metastatic breast cancer. After the surgical removal of large primary tumors, nanotherapeutic agents are localized in the premetastatic niche and at the site of the postsurgical wound, disrupting the premetastatic microenvironment and eliminating microresiduals, which radically reduces metastatic and local&#8208;regional recurrence. The findings suggest that nanotherapeutics can safely widen the therapeutic window to resuscitate colchicine and MMP inhibitors for other inflammatory disorders.

         <title>ZnS@BSA Nanoclusters Potentiate Efficacy of Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnS@BSA (bovine serum albumin) nanoclusters can promote reactive oxygen species accumulation and activate cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8208;adenosine monophosphate synthase/interferon gene stimulator signals in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), further suppressing tumor growth with more immune cells infiltration, which can serve as a new strategy for immunotherapy of HCC.








Abstract
Although immunotherapy such as immune checkpoint inhibitors has shown promising efficacy in cancer treatment, the responsiveness among patients is relatively limited. Activation of the cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8208;adenosine monophosphate synthase/interferon gene stimulator (cGAS/STING) signaling pathway to upregulate innate immunity has become an emerging strategy for enhancing tumor immunotherapy. Herein, ZnS@BSA (bovine serum albumin) nanoclusters synthesized via a self&#8208;assembly approach are reported, where the released zinc ions under acidic tumor microenvironment significantly enhance cGAS/STING signals. Meanwhile, intracellular zinc ions can produce reactive oxygen species, which is further facilitated by the generated H2S gas from ZnS@BSA via specifically inhibiting catalase in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. It is found that the nanoclusters activate the cGAS/STING signals in mice, which promotes the infiltration of CD8+ T cells at the tumor site and cross&#8208;presentation of dendritic cells, leading to an improved immunotherapy efficacy against hepatocellular carcinoma.

&lt;p&gt;ZnS@BSA (bovine serum albumin) nanoclusters can promote reactive oxygen species accumulation and activate cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase/interferon gene stimulator signals in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), further suppressing tumor growth with more immune cells infiltration, which can serve as a new strategy for immunotherapy of HCC.

         <title>A Critical Outlook for the Pursuit of Lower Contact Resistance in Organic Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Though organic transistors have long been considered as a potential cornerstone technology for flexible electronics applications, their widespread commercialization in high&#8208;frequency circuits has been substantially impeded by high contact resistance. A review of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art reveals the pivotal role of the organic&#8208;semiconductor morphology and the key challenges now to be overcome, such as Fermi&#8208;level pinning and low charge&#8208;carrier densities.








Abstract
To take full advantage of recent and anticipated improvements in the performance of organic semiconductors employed in organic transistors, the high contact resistance arising at the interfaces between the organic semiconductor and the source and drain contacts must be reduced significantly. To date, only a small portion of the accumulated research on organic thin&#8208;film transistors (TFTs) has reported channel&#8208;width&#8208;normalized contact resistances below 100 &#937;cm, well above what is regularly demonstrated in transistors based on inorganic semiconductors. A closer look at these cases and the relevant literature strongly suggests that the most significant factor leading to the lowest contact resistances in organic TFTs so far has been the control of the thin&#8208;film morphology of the organic semiconductor. By contrast, approaches aimed at increasing the charge&#8208;carrier density and/or reducing the intrinsic Schottky barrier height have so far played a relatively minor role in achieving the lowest contact resistances. Herein, the possible explanations for these observations are explored, including the prevalence of Fermi&#8208;level pinning and the difficulties in forming optimized interfaces with organic semiconductors. An overview of the research on these topics is provided, and potential device&#8208;engineering solutions are discussed based on recent advancements in the theoretical and experimental work on both organic and inorganic semiconductors.

         <title>Transformation Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transformation optics and metamaterials are useful and interesting techniques to control wave propagation at will. A comprehensive overview on manipulation of wave propagation based on coordinate transformation method and metamaterials is provided. Selected experimental fabrications for diverse waves, such as electromagnetic waves and stationary fields, are presented to demonstrate frontiers of transformation metamaterials.








Abstract
Based on the form&#8208;invariance of Maxwell's equations under coordinate transformations, mathematically smooth deformation of space can be physically equivalent to inhomogeneous and anisotropic electromagnetic (EM) medium (called a transformation medium). It provides a geometric recipe to control EM waves at will. A series of examples of achieving transformation media by artificially structured units from conventional materials is summarized here. Such concepts are firstly implemented for EM waves, and then extended to other wave dynamics, such as elastic waves, acoustic waves, surface water waves, and even stationary fields. These shall be cataloged as transformation metamaterials. In addition, it might be conceptually attractive and practically useful to control diverse waves for multi&#8208;physics designs.

         <title>Intrinsic Linear Dichroism of Organic Single Crystals toward High&#8208;Performance Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superior organic semiconductor, 2,6&#8208;diphenyl anthracene (DPA), is selected to develop polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors. High&#8208;quality DPA crystals exhibit strong anisotropic nature. Their photodetectors show remarkable polarization sensitivity with a dichroic ratio up to &#8776;1.9. It is revealed that intrinsic linear dichroism is responsible for the observed polarization sensitivity. This work demonstrates the potential of developing efficient polarization&#8208;sensitive organic photodetectors for diverse applications.








Abstract
The ability to detect light in photodetectors is central to practical optoelectronic applications, which has been demonstrated in inorganic semiconductor devices. However, so far, the study of polarization&#8208;sensitive organic photodetectors, which have unique applications in flexible and wearable electronics, has not received much attention. Herein, the construction of polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors based on the single crystals of a superior optoelectronic organic semiconductor, 2,6&#8208;diphenyl anthracene (DPA), is demonstrated. The systematic characterization of two&#8208;dimensionally grown DPA crystals with various techniques definitely show their strong anisotropy in molecular vibration, optical reflectance and optical absorption. In terms of polarization sensitivity, DPA&#8208;crystal based photodetectors exhibit a linear dichroic ratio up to &#8776;1.9. Theoretical calculations confirm that intrinsic linear dichroism, originated from the anisotropic in&#8208;plane crystal structure, is responsible for the polarization sensitivity of DPA crystals. This work opens up a new door for exploiting organic semiconductors for developing highly compact polarization photodetectors and providing new functionalities in novel flexible optical and optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Carbon Superstructures Achieving Ultra&#8208;Stable and Fast Proton&#8208;Coupled Charge Storage Kinetics</title>

Complementary acceptor&#8208;donor molecules of 2,4,6&#8208;trichloro&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and 2,6&#8208;diaminoanthraquinone form a porous organic polymer with &#8220;protic salt&#8221;&#8208;type rigid skeleton linked by &#8722;NH2+Cl&#8722;&#8722; &#8220;rivets&#8221;, which offers the cornerstone for H&#8208;bonding self&#8208;assembly of the organic backbone to carbon superstructures by &#960;&#8722;&#960; plane stacking. The superstructures achieve ultra&#8208;stable and fast proton&#8208;coupled charge storage kinetics, giving unprecedented lifespan (1&#160;000&#160;000 cycles) and high energy&#8208;density for carbon (zinc) supercapacitors.








Abstract
Designing ingenious and stable carbon nanostructures is critical but still challenging for use in energy storage devices with superior electrochemistry kinetics, durable capacitive activity, and high rate survivability. To pursue the objective, a simple self&#8208;assembly strategy is developed to access carbon superstructures built of nanoparticle embedded plates. The carbon precursors, 2,4,6&#8208;trichloro&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and 2,6&#8208;diaminoanthraquinone can form porous organic polymer with &#8220;protic salt&#8221;&#8208;type rigid skeleton linked by &#8722;NH2+Cl&#8722;&#8722; &#8220;rivets&#8221;, which provides the cornerstone for hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;guided self&#8208;assembly of the organic backbone to superstructures by &#960;&#8722;&#960; plane stacking. The ameliorative charge density distribution and decreased adsorption energy in as&#8208;fabricated carbon superstructures allow the high accessibility of the build&#8208;in protophilic sites and efficient ion diffusion with a low energy barrier. Such superstructures thus deliver ultra&#8208;stable charge storage and fast proton&#8208;coupled kinetics at the structural&#8722;chemical defects, contributing to unprecedented lifespan (1&#160;000&#160;000 cycles), high&#8208;rate capability (100 A g&#8722;1) for carbon&#8208;based supercapacitors, and an ultrahigh energy density (128&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) for Zn&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitors. The self&#8208;assembled carbon superstructures significantly improve the all&#8208;round electrochemical performances, and hold great promise for efficient energy storage.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Tailoring with Bifunctional Integration for High&#8208;Performance CO2 Photoreduction</title>

Co&#8211;Ru dual&#8208;atoms inside conjugated porous carbon nitride polymer are designed for regulation of outstanding synergistic photocatalysis during light&#8208;driven CO2 conversion, of which the bi&#8208;functionalized Co&#8211;Ru sites feature atom&#8208;specific functions with Co for dynamic carrier mobility and Ru for selective CO2 surface&#8208;boundinteraction.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom photocatalysis has been demonstrated as a novel strategy to promote heterogeneous reactions. There is a diversity of monoatomic metal species with specific functions; however, integrating representative merits into dual&#8208;single&#8208;atoms and regulating cooperative photocatalysis remain a pressing challenge. For dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalysts, enhanced photocatalytic activity would be realized through integrating bifunctional properties and tuning the synergistic effect. Herein, dual&#8208;single&#8208;atoms supported on conjugated porous carbon nitride polymer are developed for effective photocatalytic CO2 reduction, featuring the function of cobalt (Co) and ruthenium (Ru). A series of in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations are conducted for quantitative analysis of structure&#8211;performance correlation. It is concluded that the active Co sites facilitate dynamic charge transfer, while the Ru sites promote selective CO2 surface&#8208;bound interaction during CO2 photoreduction. The combination of atom&#8208;specific traits and the synergy between Co and Ru lead to the high photocatalytic CO2 conversion with corresponding apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 2.8% at 385&#160;nm, along with a high turnover number (TON) of more than 200 without addition of any sacrificial agent. This work presents an example of identifying the roles of different single&#8208;atom metals and regulating the synergy, where the two metals with unique properties collaborate to further boost the photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Towards High Performance Li&#8211;S Batteries via Sulfonate&#8208;Rich COF&#8208;Modified Separator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy of sulfonate&#8208;rich COF&#8208;modified separator is proposed for Li&#8211;S batteries, which provides a solution for tackling the issues of polysulfide shuttling and dendrite growth simultaneously. Benefiting from the chemical merits of strong electronegativity and large interlayer spacing for SCOF&#8208;2, the capacity and stability of rechargeable Li&#8211;S batteries are greatly improved.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are held great promise for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density devices; however, polysulfide shuttle and Li&#8208;dendrite growth severely hinders their commercial production. Herein, a sulfonate&#8208;rich COF (SCOF&#8208;2) is designed, synthesized, and used to modify the separator of Li&#8211;S batteries, providing a solution for the above challenges. It is found that the SCOF&#8208;2 features stronger electronegativity and larger interlayer spacing than that of none/monosulfonate COFs, which can facilitate the Li+ migration and alleviate the formation of Li&#8208;dendrites. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and in situ Raman analysis demonstrate that the SCOF&#8208;2 possesses a narrow bandgap and strong interaction on sulfur species, thereby suppressing self&#8208;discharge behavior. As a result, the modified batteries deliver an ultralow attenuation rate of 0.047% per cycle over 800 cycles at 1 C, and excellent anti&#8208;self&#8208;discharge performance by a low&#8208;capacity attenuation of 6.0% over one week. Additionally, even with the high&#8208;sulfur&#8208;loading cathode (3.2&#8211;8.2 mgs cm&#8208;2) and lean electrolyte (5&#160;&#181;L&#160;mgs&#8208;1), the batteries still exhibit &#8776;80% capacity retention over 100 cycles, showing great potential for practical application.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered InP Nanowire Photodetector for Single&#8208;Photon Level Detection at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;powered InP nanowire array photodetector is reported that can achieve single&#8208;photon level light detection at room temperature without an external bias. This is enabled by an optimized radial p&#8208;n heterojunction nanowire array design to realize near&#8208;ideal broadband absorption, extremely low dark current, and highly efficient charge carrier separation.








Abstract
Highly sensitive photodetectors with single&#8208;photon level detection are one of the key components to a range of emerging technologies, in particular the ever&#8208;growing field of optical communication, remote sensing, and quantum computing. Currently, most of the single&#8208;photon detection technologies require external biasing at high voltages and/or cooling to low temperatures, posing great limitations for wider applications. Here, InP nanowire array photodetectors that can achieve single&#8208;photon level light detection at room temperature without an external bias are demonstrated. Top&#8208;down etched, heavily doped p&#8208;type InP nanowires and n&#8208;type aluminium&#8208;doped zinc oxide (AZO)/zinc oxide (ZnO) carrier&#8208;selective contact are used to form a radial p&#8211;n junction with a built&#8208;in electric field exceeding 3 &#215; 105&#160;V cm&#8722;1&#160;at 0&#160;V. The device exhibits broadband light sensitivity and can distinguish a single photon per pulse from the dark noise at 0&#160;V, enabled by its design to realize near&#8208;ideal broadband absorption, extremely low dark current, and highly efficient charge carrier separation. Meanwhile, the bandwidth of the device reaches above 600&#160;MHz with a timing jitter of 538&#160;ps. The proposed device design provides a new pathway toward low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;sensitivity, self&#8208;powered photodetectors for numerous future applications.

         <title>Ultrafast Thermal Imprinting of Plasmonic Hotspots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plasmonic heating ordinarily leads to isotropic heating of the material. However, through nanoparticle shaping, pulsed illumination, and the right choice of material (e.g., HfN), plasmonic absorption hotspots can be directly imprinted on the lattice as heat. This approach results in extreme thermal hotspots, lasting hundreds of ps, which can boost the chemical reactivity of catalytic nanoreactors by orders of magnitude.








Abstract
Plasmonic photochemistry is driven by a rich collection of near&#8208;field, hot charge carrier, energy transfer, and thermal effects, most often accomplished by continuous wave illumination. Heat generation is usually considered undesirable, because noble metal nanoparticles heat up isotropically, losing the extreme energy confinement of the optical resonance. Here it is demonstrated through optical and heat&#8208;transfer modelling that the judicious choice of nanoreactor geometry and material enables the direct thermal imprint of plasmonic optical absorption hotspots onto the lattice with high fidelity. Transition metal nitrides (TMNs, e.g., TiN/HfN) embody the ideal material requirements, where ultrafast electron&#8211;phonon coupling prevents fast electronic heat dissipation and low thermal conductivity prolongs the heat confinement. The extreme energy confinement leads to unprecedented peak temperatures and internal heat gradients (&gt;10 K nm&#8722;1) that cannot be achieved using noble metals or any current heating method. TMN nanoreactors consequently yield up to ten thousand times more product in pulsed photothermal chemical conversion compared with noble metals (Ag, Au, Cu). These findings open up a completely unexplored realm of nano&#8208;photochemistry, where adjacent reaction centers experience substantially different temperatures for hundreds of picoseconds, long enough for bond breaking to occur.

         <title>Silk microneedle patch capable of on&#8208;demand multi&#8208;drug delivery to the brain for glioblastoma treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor, and it is associated with poor prognosis because of invasive growth. To date, surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy remains the standard treatment strategy for GBM after the exact location of the tumor has been confirmed. However, challenges still exist for many GBM patients when surgery is difficult or impossible; in many cases, surgery cannot remove the tumor completely, because the tumor tends to spread into surrounding tissues. Herein, we report the design, fabrication and application of a heterogenous silk fibroin microneedle (SMN) patch for circumventing the blood&#8208;brain barrier and releasing multiple drugs directly to the tumor site for drug combination treatment. The biocompatible and biodegradable SMN patch can dissolve slowly over time, allowing the sustained release of multiple drugs at different concentrations over an extended period of time. Furthermore, it can be triggered remotely to induce rapid drug delivery at a designated stage after implantation. In the GBM mouse models with and without tumor resection in distinct cell lines, two clinically relevant chemotherapeutic agents(thrombin and temozolomide)and targeted drug (bevacizumab) were loaded into the SMN patch at different doses and with individually controlled release profiles. The drugs were spatiotemporally and sequentially delivered to the tumor site in the mouse brain during the dissolution of the SMN patch and maintained at levels above those effective for hemostasis, anti&#8208;angiogenesis and apoptosis of tumor cells. Device application was non&#8208;toxic and resulted in both decreased tumor volume and increased survival rate in mice. The SMN patch with on&#8208;demand multi&#8208;drug delivery has potential applications for the combined administration of multiple therapeutic drugs for the clinical treatment of brain tumors when other methods are insufficient.

&lt;p&gt;Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor, and it is associated with poor prognosis because of invasive growth. To date, surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy remains the standard treatment strategy for GBM after the exact location of the tumor has been confirmed. However, challenges still exist for many GBM patients when surgery is difficult or impossible; in many cases, surgery cannot remove the tumor completely, because the tumor tends to spread into surrounding tissues. Herein, we report the design, fabrication and application of a heterogenous silk fibroin microneedle (SMN) patch for circumventing the blood-brain barrier and releasing multiple drugs directly to the tumor site for drug combination treatment. The biocompatible and biodegradable SMN patch can dissolve slowly over time, allowing the sustained release of multiple drugs at different concentrations over an extended period of time. Furthermore, it can be triggered remotely to induce rapid drug delivery at a designated stage after implantation. In the GBM mouse models with and without tumor resection in distinct cell lines, two clinically relevant chemotherapeutic agents(thrombin and temozolomide)and targeted drug (bevacizumab) were loaded into the SMN patch at different doses and with individually controlled release profiles. The drugs were spatiotemporally and sequentially delivered to the tumor site in the mouse brain during the dissolution of the SMN patch and maintained at levels above those effective for hemostasis, anti-angiogenesis and apoptosis of tumor cells. Device application was non-toxic and resulted in both decreased tumor volume and increased survival rate in mice. The SMN patch with on-demand multi-drug delivery has potential applications for the combined administration of multiple therapeutic drugs for the clinical treatment of brain tumors when other methods are insufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Controllable SiOx Nanorod Memristive Neuron for Probabilistic Bayesian Inference</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Modern artificial neural network technology using a deterministic computing framework is faced with a critical challenge in dealing with massive genuine data that are largely unstructured and ambiguous. This challenge demands the advances of an elementary physical device for tackling the uncertainties inherent to natural data, which can be a stepping stone for realizing probabilistic neural networks. Here, we designed and fabricated a SiOx nanorod memristive device by employing the glancing angle deposition (GLAD) technique, suggesting a controllable stochastic artificial neuron that can mimic the fundamental integrate&#8208;and&#8208;fire signaling and stochastic dynamics of a biological neuron. The SiOx nanorod structure provides the random distribution of multiple nanopores all across the active area, capable of forming a multitude of Si switching filaments at many SiOx nanorod edges after the electromigration process, leading to a stochastic switching event with a very high dynamic range (up to &#8764;5.15 &#215; 1010) and low energy (up to &#8764; 4.06 pJ) for firing. Different probabilistic activation (ProbAct) functions in a sigmoid form are implemented, showing its controllability with low variation by manufacturing and electrical programming schemes. Furthermore, as an application prospect, based on the suggested memristive neuron, we demonstrated the self&#8208;resting neural operation with the local circuit configuration and revealed probabilistic Bayesian inferences for genetic regulatory networks with low normalized mean squared errors (&lt; &#8764;2.41 &#215; 10&#8722;2) and its robustness to the ProbAct variation.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Driven Biomaterials Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advancement of machine learning (ML) in materials science has progressed in leaps and bounds and has made a big impact into biomaterials research, ranging from discovery of bioactive chemical moieties, screening and optimization of material properties, to developing materials that interface better with biological systems. There is still untapped potential to integrate with ML for the next frontier in biomaterials.








Abstract
Biomaterials is an exciting and dynamic field, which uses a collection of diverse materials to achieve desired biological responses. While there is constant evolution and innovation in materials with time, biomaterials research has been hampered by the relatively long development period required. In recent years, driven by the need to accelerate materials development, the applications of machine learning in materials science has progressed in leaps and bounds. The combination of machine learning with high&#8208;throughput theoretical predictions and high&#8208;throughput experiments (HTE) has shifted the traditional Edisonian (trial and error) paradigm to a data&#8208;driven paradigm. In this review, each type of biomaterial and their key properties and use cases are systematically discussed, followed by how machine learning can be applied in the development and design process. The discussions are classified according to various types of materials used including polymers, metals, ceramics, and nanomaterials, and implants using additive manufacturing. Last, the current gaps and potential of machine learning to further aid biomaterials discovery and application are also discussed.

         <title>High&#8208;Specificity In Vivo Tumor Imaging Using Bioorthogonal NIR&#8208;IIb Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioorthogonal lanthanide&#8208;based nanoprobes are developed for deep&#8208;tissue NIR&#8208;IIb imaging and MRI with high tumor&#8208;targeting specificity. These bioorthogonal nanoprobes offer a 20&#8208;fold increase in the NIR&#8208;IIb imaging signal and a 2&#8208;fold increase in the MRI signal, compared with non&#8208;orthogonal probes.








Abstract
Lanthanide&#8208;based NIR&#8208;IIb nanoprobes are ideal for in vivo imaging. However, existing NIR&#8208;IIb nanoprobes often suffer from low tumor&#8208;targeting specificity, limiting their widespread use. Here the application of bioorthogonal nanoprobes with high tumor&#8208;targeting specificity for in vivo NIR&#8208;IIb luminescence imaging and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is reported. These dual&#8208;modality nanoprobes can enhance NIR&#8208;IIb emission by 20&#8208;fold and MRI signal by twofold, compared with non&#8208;bioorthogonal nanoprobes in murine subcutaneous tumors. Moreover, these bioorthogonal probes enable orthotopic brain tumor imaging. Implementation of bio&#8208;orthogonal chemistry significantly reduces the nanoprobe dose and hence cytotoxicity, providing a paradigm for real&#8208;time in vivo visualization of tumors.

         <title>Investigation of the Effect of 3&#8208;dimensional Meniscus Geometry on Fluid Dynamics and Crystallization Via in Situ optical microscopy&#8208;assisted Mathematical Modeling</title>

Abstract
Solution&#8208;based thin&#8208;film solidification is a complex process involving various transport phenomena that are intricately dependent on multiple experimental parameters. The difficulty of analyzing this process experimentally or conducting exact numerical simulation make it challenging to understand, predict, and control the solidification process. In this work, we propose a simple and effective technique to analyze the thin&#8208;film solidification process during solution shearing, based on 3D geometrical model of the meniscus. The 3D meniscus geometry, which changes depending on the experimental parameters, was attained using high&#8208;speed side&#8208;view and top&#8208;view in situ microscopy. Thereafter, mass and momentum transport mathematical models were applied to obtain numerical solutions of transport phenomena within the meniscus. Utilizing these results, the underlying mechanism of dendritic growth of small molecule organic semiconductor was elucidated, which has previously been unknown. The 3D meniscus modeling was particularly important for this analysis, as dendrite formation is strongly dependent on the meniscus geometry near the contact line and mass transport variation perpendicular to the coating direction. Our technique enables the study of complex relationship between experimental parameters and solidification process, which is widely applicable to various materials and coating systems; whereby, better understanding of thin&#8208;film growth and device performance optimization is possible.

         <title>Gas&#8208;Phase Fluorination of Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has received much attention in recent years as a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) dielectric material with potential applications ranging from catalysts to electronics. hBN is a stable covalent compound with a planar hexagonal lattice and is relatively unreactive to most chemical environments, making the chemical functionalization of hBN challenging. Here, we report a simple, scalable strategy to fluorinate hBN using a direct gas&#8208;phase fluorination technique. The nature of fluorine bonding to the hBN lattice and their chemical coordination are described based on various characterization studies and theoretical models. The fluorine functionalized hBN shows a bandgap reduction and displays a semiconducting behavior due to the fluorination process. Additionally, the fluorinated hBN shows significant improvement in its thermal and friction properties, which could be substantial in applications such as lubricants and thermal fluids. Theory and simulations reveal that the enhanced friction properties of fluorinated hBN result from reduced inter&#8208;planar interaction energy by electrostatic repulsion of intercalated fluorine atoms between hBN layers without significant disruption of the in&#8208;plane lattice. This technique paves the way for the fluorination of several other 2D structures for various applications such as magnetism and functional nanoscale electronic devices.

         <title>Insights into Redox Processes and Correlated Performance of Organic Carbonyl Electrode Materials in Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic carbonyl compounds have been considered as promising electrode materials for high&#8208;performance rechargeable batteries. However, their redox processes and performance need to be fully understood. An in&#8208;depth understanding on redox processes and the correlated electrochemical performance of organic carbonyl electrode materials is provided, with the aim of promoting their practical applications in the foreseeable future.








Abstract
Organic carbonyl electrode materials have shown great prospects for rechargeable batteries in view of their high capacity, flexible designability, and sustainable production. However, organic carbonyl electrode materials still suffer from unsatisfactory electrochemical performance, which is highly relevant to their redox processes. Herein, an in&#8208;depth understanding on redox processes and the correlated electrochemical performance of organic carbonyl electrode materials is provided. The redox processes discussed mainly involve molecular structure evolution (intermediates), crystal structure evolution (phase transition), and charge storage mechanisms. The properties of intermediates can affect voltage, cycling stability, reversible capacity, and rate performance of batteries. Moreover, the reversible capacity/cycling stability and rate performance would be also influenced by phase transition and charge storage mechanisms (diffusion&#8208; or surface&#8208;controlled), respectively. To accelerate the practical applications of organic carbonyl electrode materials, future work should focus on developing more in situ or operando characterization techniques and further understanding the intrinsic relationships between redox processes and performance. It is hoped that the work discussed herein will stimulate more attention to the detailed redox processes and their correlations with the performance of organic carbonyl electrode materials in rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Simultaneously blocking chemical crosstalk and internal short circuit via gel&#8208;stretching derived nanoporous non&#8208;shrinkage separator for safe lithium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Separator, an ionic permeable and electronic insulating membrane between cathode and anode, plays a crucial role in the electrochemical and safety performance of batteries. However, the commercial polyolefin separators not only suffer from inevitable thermal shrinkage at elevated temperature, but also fail to inhibit the hidden chemical crosstalk of reactive gases such as O2, leading to often reported thermal runaway (TR) and hence preventing large&#8208;scale implementation of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, a nanoporous non&#8208;shrinkage separator (GS&#8208;PI) was fabricated via a novel gel&#8208;stretching orientation approach to eliminate TR. In situ synchrotron small angle X&#8208;ray scattering during heating clearly showed that the as&#8208;prepared thin GS&#8208;PI separator exhibits superior mechanical tolerance at high temperature, thus effectively preventing internal short circuit. Meanwhile, the unique nanoporous structure design further blocks chemical crosstalk and the associated exothermic reactions. Accelerating Rate Calorimetry test revealed that the practical 1 Ah LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622)/graphite pouch cell using GS&#8208;PI nanoporous separator show a maximum temperature rise (dT/dtmax) of only 3.7&#160;&#176;C s&#8722;1 compared to 131.6&#160;&#176;C s&#8722;1 in the case of Al2O3@PE macroporous separator. Moreover, despite the reduced pore size, the GS&#8208;PI separator demonstrates better cycling stability than conventional Al2O3@PE separator at high temperature without sacrificing specific capacity and rate capability.

         <title>Ultrarobust and High&#8208;Performance Rotational Hydrodynamic Triboelectric Nanogenerator Enabled by Automatic Mode Switch and Charge Excitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is an emerging technology for the ambient mechanical energy harvesting, which provides a possibility to realize the wild environment monitor by self&#8208;powered sensing systems. However, TENG is limited in some practical applications as a result of low output performance (low charge density) and mechanical durability (material abrasion). Herein, an ultrarobust and high&#8208;performance rotational TENG enabled by automatic mode switch (contact mode in low speed and non&#8208;contact in high speed) and charge excitation is proposed. It displays excellent stability maintaining 94% electrical output after 72,000 cycles, much higher than that of the normal contact mode TENG (30%). Due to its high electrical stability and large electrical output, this TENG powers 944 green LEDs to brightness in series. Furthermore, by harvesting the water flow energy, various commercial capacitors can be charged fast, and the self&#8208;powered fire alarm, and self&#8208;powered temperature and humidity detection are realized. This work provides an ideal scheme for enhancing the mechanical durability, broadening the range of working frequency and improving the electrical output of TENG. In addition, the high performance hydrodynamic triboelectric nanogenerator demonstrated in this work would have great applications for Internet of Things in remote area.

         <title>Interfacial Manipulation via In Situ Grown ZnSe Cultivator toward Highly Reversible Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Zn metal anode has garnered growing scientific and industrial interest owing to its appropriate redox potential, low cost and high safety. Nevertheless, the instability of Zn anode caused by dendrite formation, hydrogen evolution and side reactions has greatly hampered its commercialization. Herein, an in situ grown ZnSe overlayer is crafted over one side of commercial Zn foil via chemical vapor deposition in a scalable manner, aiming to achieve optimized electrolyte/Zn interfaces with large&#8208;scale viability. Impressively, thus&#8208;derived ZnSe coating functions as a cultivator to guide oriented growth of Zn (002) plane at the infancy stage of stripping/plating cycles, thereby inhibiting the formation of Zn dendrites and the occurrence of side reactions. As a result, high cyclic stability (1530 h at 1.0&#160;mA cm&#8211;2/1.0 mAh cm&#8722;2; 172 h at 30.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/10.0 mAh cm&#8722;2) in symmetric cells is harvested. Meanwhile, when paired with V2O5 based cathode, assembled full cell achieves an outstanding capacity (194.5 mAh g&#8211;1) and elongated lifespan (a capacity retention of 84% after 1000 cycles) at 5.0 A g&#8211;1. Our reversible Zn anode enabled by the interfacial manipulation strategy via ZnSe cultivator is anticipated to satisfy the demand of commercial use.

         <title>Engineering Polysaccharide&#8208;Based Hydrogel Photonic Constructs: From Multiscale Detection to the Biofabrication of Living Optical Fibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polysaccharide&#8208;based, multilayered hydrogel fibers in the photonics arena are explored. Natural ionic&#8208;crosslinking hydrogels are leveraged for developing a hydrogel fiber fusion splicing method and combined with nanoplasmonic&#8208;based photonics for detecting biotargets such as SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. The integration of living entities in the cytocompatible light&#8208;guiding core enables the digitalization and quantification of complex 3D biological events, such as cancer invasive proliferation.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state optics has been the pillar of modern digital age. Integrating soft hydrogel materials with micro/nanooptics could expand the horizons of photonics for bioengineering. Here, wet&#8208;spun multilayer hydrogel fibers are engineered through ionic&#8208;crosslinked natural polysaccharides that serve as multifunctional platforms. The resulting flexible hydrogel structure and reversible crosslinking provide tunable design properties such as adjustable refractive index and fusion splicing. Modulation of the optical readout via physical stimuli, including shape, compression, and multiple optical inputs/outputs is demonstrated. The unique permeability of the hydrogels is also combined with plasmonic nanoparticles for molecular detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in fiber&#8208;coupled biomedical swabs. A tricoaxial 3D printing nozzle is then employed for the continuous fabrication of living optical fibers. Light interaction with living cells enables the quantification and digitalization of complex biological phenomena such as 3D cancer progression and drug susceptibility. These fibers pave the way for advances in biomaterial&#8208;based photonics and biosensing platforms.

Abstract
Organic single crystals with excellent optical and electrical properties are critical for the development of organic optoelectronics. Herein, two compounds 9,10&#8208;bis([N,N&#8208;diphenyl]&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;phenylethynyl)anthracene (TPA&#8208;An) and 9,10&#8208;bis([1&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;diphenyl]&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;phenylethynyl)anthracene (TBA&#8208;An) are synthesized by introducing two different luminescent groups, triphenylamine and 1,3&#8208;diphenylbenzene, at the 9,10 positions of anthracene via triple bond connection. Single crystals based on TPA&#8208;An and TBA&#8208;An with a ribbon morphology obtained through the slow solvent&#8208;evaporation method exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 98% and 99% at room temperature, and remarkable hole mobilities of 0.45 and 0.15 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in single&#8208;crystal organic field&#8208;effect transistors (SC&#8208;OFETs). Furthermore, UV phototransistors based on the two single crystals obtain photosensitivities of 1.03 &#215; 103 and 3.45 &#215; 104, ultrahigh photoresponsivities of 7.19 &#215; 105 and 1.50&#160;&#215; 105 A W&#8722;1, and the detectivities exceeding 1.40 &#215; 1016 and 1.60 &#215; 1017 Jones.

         <title>Photocatalytic Z&#8208;Scheme Overall Water Splitting: Recent Advances in Theory and Experiments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solar&#8208;driven water splitting has attracted substantial attention over the past decades as it not only provides a clean and sustainable fuel but also promises to dramatically reduce CO2 emissions. The utmost possible form of artificial photosynthesis is a two&#8208;step photoexcitation known as &#8220;Z&#8208;scheme&#8221;, which mimics the natural photosystem, and considerably enhances the stability and efficiency of overall water splitting.








Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting is considered one of the most important and appealing approaches for the production of green H2 to address the global energy demand. The utmost possible form of artificial photosynthesis is a two&#8208;step photoexcitation known as &#8220;Z&#8208;scheme&#8221;, which mimics the natural photosystem. This process solely relies on the effective coupling and suitable band positions of semiconductors (SCs) and redox mediators for the purpose to catalyze the surface chemical reactions and significantly deter the backward reaction. In recent years, the Z&#8208;scheme strategies and their key role have been studied progressively through experimental approaches. In addition, theoretical studies based on density functional theory have provided detailed insight into the mechanistic aspects of some breathtakingly complex problems associated with hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. In this context, this critical review gives an overview of the fundamentals of Z&#8208;scheme photocatalysis, including both theoretical and experimental advancements in the field of photocatalytic water splitting, and suggests future perspectives.

         <title>Interactions of Metal Nanoclusters with Light: Fundamentals and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal nanoclusters have recently emerged as a promising class of optical materials. How they interact with light is a key consideration in the design of high&#8208;quality optical materials based on nanoclusters. The basic principles of the interactions between light and nanoclusters and highlights their optical applications are discussed.








Abstract
The interactions of materials with light determine their applications in various fields. In the past decade, ultrasmall metal nanoclusters (NCs) have emerged as a promising class of optical materials due to their unique molecular&#8208;like properties. Herein, the basic principles of optical absorption and photoluminescence of metal NCs, their interactions with polarized light, and light&#8208;induced chemical reactions, are discussed, highlighting the roles of the core and protecting ligands/motifs of metal NCs in their interactions with light. The metal core and protecting ligands/motifs determine the electronic structures of metal NCs, which are closely related to their optical properties. In addition, the protecting ligands/motifs of metal NCs contribute to their photoluminescence and chiral origin, further promoting the interactions of metal NCs with light through various pathways. The fundamentals of light&#8211;NC interactions provide guidance for the design of metal NCs in optical applications, which are discussed in the second part. In the last section, some strategies are proposed to further understand light&#8211;NC interactions, highlighting the challenges and opportunities. It is hoped that this work will stimulate more research on the optical properties of metal NCs and their applications in various fields.

         <title>Photoinduced Halide Segregation in Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper 2D Mixed Halide Perovskite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D mixed halide perovskites with bandgap tunability and increased stability are employed in photovoltaics, light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), and optoelectronics. Inherent halide ion mobility (instability) of mixed halides drives photoinduced halide ion segregation. The important role of dimensionality across 3D to 2D perovskites governs the excited&#8208;state dynamics and the kinetics of halide segregation and dark recovery.








Abstract
2D lead halide perovskites, which exhibit bandgap tunability and increased chemical stability, have been found to be useful for designing optoelectronic devices. Reducing dimensionality with decreasing number of layers (n&#160;=&#160;10&#8211;1) also imparts resistance to light&#8208;induced ion migration as seen from the halide ion segregation and dark recovery in mixed halide (Br:I&#160;=&#160;50:50) perovskite films. The light&#8208;induced halide ion segregation efficiency, as determined from difference absorbance spectra, decreases from 20% to &lt;1%&#160;as the dimensionality is decreased for 2D perovskite film from n&#160;=&#160;10 to 1. The segregation rate constant (ksegregation), which decreases from 5.9&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;s&#8722;1 (n&#160;=&#160;10) to 3.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4&#160;s&#8722;1 (n&#160;=&#160;1), correlates well with nearly an order of magnitude decrease observed in charge&#8208;carrier lifetime (&#964;average&#160;=&#160;233&#160;ps for n&#160;=&#160;10&#160;vs &#964;avg&#160;=&#160;27&#160;ps for n&#160;=&#160;1). The tightly bound excitons in 2D perovskites make charge separation less probable, which in turn decreases the halide mobility and resulting phase segregation. The importance of controlling the dimensionality of the 2D architecture in suppressing halide ion mobility is discussed.

     alt="Photoinduced Halide Segregation in Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper 2D Mixed Halide Perovskite Films"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D mixed halide perovskites with bandgap tunability and increased stability are employed in photovoltaics, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and optoelectronics. Inherent halide ion mobility (instability) of mixed halides drives photoinduced halide ion segregation. The important role of dimensionality across 3D to 2D perovskites governs the excited-state dynamics and the kinetics of halide segregation and dark recovery.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D lead halide perovskites, which exhibit bandgap tunability and increased chemical stability, have been found to be useful for designing optoelectronic devices. Reducing dimensionality with decreasing number of layers (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;10&#8211;1) also imparts resistance to light-induced ion migration as seen from the halide ion segregation and dark recovery in mixed halide (Br:I&#160;=&#160;50:50) perovskite films. The light-induced halide ion segregation efficiency, as determined from difference absorbance spectra, decreases from 20% to &amp;lt;1%&#160;as the dimensionality is decreased for 2D perovskite film from &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;10 to 1. The segregation rate constant (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;segregation&lt;/sub&gt;), which decreases from 5.9&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;10) to 3.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;1), correlates well with nearly an order of magnitude decrease observed in charge-carrier lifetime (&#964;&lt;sub&gt;average&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;233&#160;ps for &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;10&#160;vs &#964;&lt;sub&gt;avg&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;27&#160;ps for &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;1). The tightly bound excitons in 2D perovskites make charge separation less probable, which in turn decreases the halide mobility and resulting phase segregation. The importance of controlling the dimensionality of the 2D architecture in suppressing halide ion mobility is discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cycloruthenated Self&#8208;Assembly with Metabolic Inhibition to Efficiently Overcome Multidrug Resistance in Cancers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
In this study we report the synthesis and the evaluation of the efficacy of a cycloruthenated complex, RuZ, to overcome multi&#8208;drug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells. RuZ could self&#8208;assemble into nanoaggregates in the cell culture medium and resulted in a high intracellular concentration of RuZ in MDR cancer cells. The self&#8208;assembly significantly decreased oxygen consumption and inhibited glycolysis, which decreased cellular ATP levels. The reduction in ATP levels and its low affinity for the ABCB1 and ABCG2 transporters (which mediate MDR) significantly increased the retention of RuZ by MDR cancer cells. Furthermore, RuZ increased cellular oxidative stress, inducing DNA damage, and in combination with the aforementioned effects of RuZ, increased the apoptosis of cancer cells. Proteomic profiling analysis suggested that the RuZ primarily decreased the expression of proteins that mediate glycolysis and aerobic mitochondrial respiration and increased the expression of proteins involved in apoptosis. RuZ inhibited the proliferation of 35 cancer cell lines, of which 7 cell lines were resistant to clinical drugs. It was also active in doxorubicin&#8208;resistant MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231/Adr mouse tumor xenograft. To the best of our knowledge, our results are the first to show that self&#8208;assembled cycloruthenated complexes are efficacious in inhibiting the growth of MDR cancer cells.

         <title>2D Cu9S5/PtS2/WSe2 Double Heterojunction Bipolar Transistor with High Current Gain</title>

Abstract
Bipolar junction transistor (BJT), one important circuit element in the integrated circuits, is now widely used in high&#8208;speed computation and communication for its capability of high&#8208;power signal amplification. 2D materials and their heterostructures are promising in building high&#8208;amplification and high&#8208;frequency BJTs because they can be naturally thin and highly designable in tailoring components properties. However, currently the low emitter injection efficiency results in only moderate current gain achieved in the pioneer researches, severely restraining its future development. Herein, we show an elaborately designed double heterojunction bipolar transistor (DHBT) can greatly promote the injection efficiency, improving the current gain by order of magnitude. In this DHBT we use high&#8208;doping&#8208;density wide&#8208;bandgap 2D Cu9S5 as emitter and narrow&#8208;bandgap PtS2 as base. This heterostructure efficiently suppress the current ratio of reverse electron flux from base and increase the injection efficiency. By exploiting this high injection efficiency, our DHBT experimentally achieves an excellent common&#8208;base current gain (&#945; = ~0.996) and common&#8208;emitter current gain (&#946; = ~910). This work systematically explores the electrical behavior of 2D materials based DHBT, and provides deep insight of the architecture design for building high gain DHBT, which may promote the applications of 2D&#8208;materials based heterojunctions in the fields of integrated circuits.

         <title>Mesenchymal Stem Cell&#8208;derived Extracellular Vesicles with High PD&#8208;L1 Expression for Autoimmune Diseases Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Autoimmune diseases are the third most common disease influencing the quality of life of many patients. Here, we develop a PD&#8208;L1+ mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) derived extracellular vesicles (MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1) using lentivirus&#8208;mediated gene transfection technology for reconfiguration of the local immune microenvironment of affected tissue in autoimmune diseases. MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 exhibits an impressive ability to regulate various activated immune cells to an immunosuppressed state in vitro. More importantly, in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)&#8208;induced ulcerative colitis (UC) and imiquimod&#8208;induced psoriasis mouse models, we observe a significantly high accumulation of MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 in the inflamed tissues compared to the PD&#8208;L1+ MSCs. Therapeutic efficiency in both UC and psoriasis mouse disease models is demonstrated using MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 to reshape the inflammatory ecosystem in the local immune context. We develop a technology using MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 as a natural delivery platform for autoimmune diseases treatment with high clinical potential.

         <title>Liquid metal&#8208;enabled Mechanical energy&#8208;induced CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We report a green carbon capture and conversion technology offering scalability and economic viability for mitigating CO2 emissions. The technology uses suspensions of gallium liquid metal to reduce CO2 into carbonaceous solid products and O2 at near room temperature. The nonpolar nature of the liquid gallium interface allows the solid products to instantaneously exfoliate, hence keeping active sites accessible. The solid co&#8208;contributor of silver&#8208;gallium rods ensures a cyclic sustainable process. The overall process relies on mechanical energy as the input, which drives nano dimensional triboelectrochemical reactions. When a gallium/silver fluoride mix at 7:1 mass ratio is employed to create the reaction material, 92% efficiency was obtained at the remarkably low input energy of 230 kW&#8729;h for the capture and conversion of a tonne of CO2. This green technology presents an economical solution for CO2 emissions.

         <title>Design Quasi&#8208;MOF Nanospheres as Dynamic Electrocatalyst toward Accelerated Sulfur Reduction Reaction for High Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Lithium sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries have been considered as one of the most promising next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries owing to its high energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the sluggish kinetics of the sulfur reduction reaction process, which is so far insufficiently explored, still impedes its practical application.&#160;Metal organic frameworks (MOF) are widely investigated as&#160;sulfur immobilizer, but the interactions and catalytic activity of lithium polysulfides (LiPs) on metal nodes are weak due to the presence of organic ligands. Herein, we present a strategy to design Quasi&#8208;MOF nanospheres, which has a transition&#8208;state structure between MOF and metal oxide, via controlled ligand exchange strategy to serve as sulfur electrocatalyst. The Quasi&#8208;MOF not only inherits the porous structure of MOF, but also exposes abundant metal nodes to act as active sites, rendering strong LiPs absorbability. The reversible deligandation/ligandation of Quasi&#8208;MOF and its impact on the durability of catalyst over the course of electrochemical process has been acknowledged, which confers a remarkable catalytic activity. Attributed to these structural advantages, Quasi&#8208;MOF delivers a decent discharge capacity and low capacity fading rate over long&#8208;term cycling. This work not only offers insight into the rational design of Quasi&#8208;MOF based composite, but also provides guidance for the application in Li&#8208;S batteries.

Herein, we present a strategy to design Quasi-MOF nanospheres, which has a transition-state structure between MOF and metal oxide, via controlled ligand exchange strategy to serve as sulfur electrocatalyst. The Quasi-MOF not only inherits the porous structure of MOF, but also exposes abundant metal nodes to act as active sites, rendering strong LiPs absorbability. The reversible deligandation/ligandation of Quasi-MOF and its impact on the durability of catalyst over the course of electrochemical process has been acknowledged, which confers a remarkable catalytic activity. Attributed to these structural advantages, Quasi-MOF delivers a decent discharge capacity and low capacity fading rate over long-term cycling. This work not only offers insight into the rational design of Quasi-MOF based composite, but also provides guidance for the application in Li-S batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Conversion&#8208;type Non&#8208;metal Elemental Tellurium Anode with High Utilization for Mild/alkaline Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Zinc ion batteries (ZIBs), generally established on an excessive metallic Zn anode and aqueous electrolytes, suffer from severe dendrites and gassing issues at Zn side, resulting in poor cycling life. Substituting Zn metal anode with non&#8208;Zn ones is a promising strategy for solving these problems, whereas this is still restricted by the limited anode alternatives. Herein, by replacing metal Zn with chalcogen element tellurium (Te), we reported a conversion&#8208;type Te based ZIB that can work in both mild and alkaline electrolytes. As expected, the as&#8208;assembled mild Te/MnO2 and alkaline Te/Ni(OH)2 cells deliver remarkable capacities up to 106 and 161 mAh g&#8211;1anode+cathode, respectively, with a high utilization of anode (50.1% for the Te/MnO2 and 38.9% for the Te/Ni(OH)2), which surpass all ZIBs. Ultra&#8208;long cycling life (over 75% capacity retention after 5000 cycles) was achieved in the two systems, benefiting from the stable conversion mechanisms (mild: Te to ZnTe2 to ZnTe; alkaline: ZnTe to Te to TeO2) with thoroughly eliminated dendrites and gassing. Moreover, high gravimetric energy density of ZIBs was also achieved, which are 176.3&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1anode+cathdoe (Te/Ni(OH)2) and 81&#160;Wh Kg&#8211;1anode+cathode (Te/MnO2), respectively. This work sheds light on the development of advanced conversion&#8208;type anode for high&#8208;performance batteries with superior stability.

         <title>Viologen&#8208;Immobilized Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer Film Enabling Highly Efficient Electrochromic Device for Solar&#8208;Powered Smart Window</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Electrochromic devices (ECDs) have emerged as a unique class of optoelectronic devices for the development of smart windows. However, current ECDs typically suffer from low coloration efficiency (CE) and high energy consumption, which have thus hindered their practical applications, especially as components in solar&#8208;powered EC windows. Here, we demonstrate the high&#8208;performance ECDs with a fully crystalline viologen&#8208;immobilized 2D polymer (V2DP) thin film as the color&#8208;switching layer. The high density of vertically oriented pore channels (pore size, &#8764;4.5&#160;nm; pore density, &#8764;5.8 &#215; 1016 m&#8722;2) in the synthetic V2DP film enables high utilization of redox&#8208;active viologen moieties and benefits for Li+ ion diffusion/transport. As a result, the as&#8208;fabricated ECDs achieve a rapid switching speed (coloration, 2.8 s; bleaching, 1.2 s), and a high CE (989 cm2 C&#8722;1), and low energy consumption (21.1 &#956;W cm&#8722;2). Moreover, we manage to fabricate transmission&#8208;tunable, self&#8208;sustainable EC window prototypes by vertically integrating the V2DP ECDs with transparent solar cells. This work sheds light on designing electroactive 2D polymers with molecular precision for optoelectronics and paves a practical route toward developing self&#8208;powered EC windows to offset the electricity consumption of buildings.

         <title>Asymmetric Elimination Reaction on Chiral Metal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The production of enantiopure materials and molecules is of uttermost relevance in research and industry in numerous contexts, ranging from non&#8208;linear optics to asymmetric synthesis. In the context of the latter, we have investigated dehalogenation, which is an essential reaction step for a broad class of chemical reactions. Specifically, dehalogenation of prochiral 5&#8208;bromo&#8208;7&#8208;methylbenz(a)anthracene (BMA) on prototypical, chiral, intermetallic PdGa{111} surfaces under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Enantioselective halogen elimination is demonstrated by combining temperature&#8208;programmed x&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and density functional theory. On the PdGa{111} surfaces, the difference in debromination temperatures for the two BMA surface enantiomers amounts up to unprecedented 46 K. The significant dependence of the dehalogenation temperature of the BMA surface enantiomers on the atomic termination of the PdGa{111} surfaces, implies that the ensemble effect is pronounced in this reaction step. These findings evidence enantiospecific control and hence promote intrinsically chiral crystals for asymmetric on&#8208;surface synthesis.

         <title>Dense Silicon Nanowire Networks Grown on a Stainless Steel Fiber Cloth: A Flexible and Robust Anode for Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Silicon nanowires (Si NWs) have great promise as an anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to their very high specific capacity. Achieving adequate mass loadings for binder&#8211;free Si NWs have been restricted by low surface area, mechanically unstable and poorly conductive current collectors (CC), as well as complicated and expensive fabrication routes. Herein, we report a tunable mass loading and dense Si NW growth on a highly conductive, flexible, fire&#8208;resistant and mechanically robust interwoven stainless steel fiber cloth (SSFC) using a simple glassware setup. The SSFC CC facilitates dense growth of Si NWs where its open structure allows a buffer space for expansion/contraction during Li&#8211;cycling. The Si NWs@SSFC anode displays a stable performance for 500 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of more than 99.5%. Galvanostatic cycling of the Si NWs@SSFC anode with a mass loading of 1.32&#160;mg.cm&#8211;2 achieves a stable areal capacity of &#8764;2 mAh.cm&#8211;2 at 0.2C after 200 cycles. Si NWs@SSFC anodes with different mass loadings were characterized before and after cycling by SEM and TEM to examine the effects of Li&#8211;cycling on the morphology. Notably, our approach allows the large&#8211;scale fabrication of robust and flexible binder&#8211;free Si NWs@SSFC architectures, which makes it viable for practical applications in high energy density LIBs.

         <title>Advances in Catalytic Applications of Zeolite&#8208;Supported Metal Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent research progresses on the catalytic applications of zeolite&#8208;supported metal catalysts for diverse reactions (e.g., hydrogenation reactions, dehydrogenation reactions, oxidation reactions, hydroisomerization, and selective catalytic reduction of NOx with ammonia) are comprehensively summarized. Some current limitations and future perspectives on challenges and opportunities for this subject are also highlighted.








Abstract
Zeolites possessing large specific surface areas, ordered micropores, and adjustable acidity/basicity have emerged as ideal supports to immobilize metal species with small sizes and high dispersities. In recent years, the zeolite&#8208;supported metal catalysts have been widely used in diverse catalytic processes, showing excellent activity, superior thermal/hydrothermal stability, and unique shape&#8208;selectivity. In this review, a comprehensive summary of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art achievements in catalytic applications of zeolite&#8208;supported metal catalysts are presented for important heterogeneous catalytic processes in the last five years, mainly including 1) the hydrogenation reactions (e.g., CO/CO2 hydrogenation, hydrogenation of unsaturated compounds, and hydrogenation of nitrogenous compounds); 2) dehydrogenation reactions (e.g., alkane dehydrogenation and dehydrogenation of chemical hydrogen storage materials); 3) oxidation reactions (e.g., CO oxidation, methane oxidation, and alkene epoxidation); and 4) other reactions (e.g., hydroisomerization reaction and selective catalytic reduction of NOx with ammonia reaction). Finally, some current limitations and future perspectives on the challenge and opportunity for this subject are pointed out. It is believed that this review will inspire more innovative research on the synthesis and catalysis of zeolite&#8208;supported metal catalysts and promote their future developments to meet the emerging demands for practical applications.

     alt="Advances in Catalytic Applications of Zeolite-Supported Metal Catalysts"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent research progresses on the catalytic applications of zeolite-supported metal catalysts for diverse reactions (e.g., hydrogenation reactions, dehydrogenation reactions, oxidation reactions, hydroisomerization, and selective catalytic reduction of NO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; with ammonia) are comprehensively summarized. Some current limitations and future perspectives on challenges and opportunities for this subject are also highlighted.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zeolites possessing large specific surface areas, ordered micropores, and adjustable acidity/basicity have emerged as ideal supports to immobilize metal species with small sizes and high dispersities. In recent years, the zeolite-supported metal catalysts have been widely used in diverse catalytic processes, showing excellent activity, superior thermal/hydrothermal stability, and unique shape-selectivity. In this review, a comprehensive summary of the state-of-the-art achievements in catalytic applications of zeolite-supported metal catalysts are presented for important heterogeneous catalytic processes in the last five years, mainly including 1) the hydrogenation reactions (e.g., CO/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation, hydrogenation of unsaturated compounds, and hydrogenation of nitrogenous compounds); 2) dehydrogenation reactions (e.g., alkane dehydrogenation and dehydrogenation of chemical hydrogen storage materials); 3) oxidation reactions (e.g., CO oxidation, methane oxidation, and alkene epoxidation); and 4) other reactions (e.g., hydroisomerization reaction and selective catalytic reduction of NO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; with ammonia reaction). Finally, some current limitations and future perspectives on the challenge and opportunity for this subject are pointed out. It is believed that this review will inspire more innovative research on the synthesis and catalysis of zeolite-supported metal catalysts and promote their future developments to meet the emerging demands for practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Measurement of Oxygen Mass Transport at the Nanoscale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method based on atom probe tomography for the direct measurement of ion kinetics at the nanoscale is reported. Extremely high 3D resolution (&lt;1&#160;nm) and straight correlation with local cation distribution are demonstrated for the exemplary case of a mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductor exhibiting enhanced grain boundary oxygen diffusivity.








Abstract
Tuning oxygen mass transport properties at the nanoscale offers a promising approach for developing high performing energy materials. A number of strategies for engineering interfaces with enhanced oxygen diffusivity and surface exchange have been proposed. However, the origin and the magnitude of such local effects remain largely undisclosed to date due to the lack of direct measurement tools with sufficient resolution. In this work, atom probe tomography with sub&#8208;nanometer resolution is used to study oxygen mass transport on oxygen&#8208;isotope exchanged thin films of lanthanum chromite. A direct 3D visualization of nanoscaled highly conducting oxygen incorporation pathways along grain boundaries, with reliable quantification of the oxygen kinetic parameters and correlative link to local chemistries, is presented. Combined with finite element simulations of the exact nanostructure, isotope exchange&#8208;atom probe tomography allowed quantifying an enhancement in the grain boundary oxygen diffusivity and in the surface exchange coefficient of lanthanum chromite of about 4 and 3 orders of magnitude, respectively, compared to the bulk. This remarkable increase of the oxygen kinetics in an interface&#8208;dominated material is unambiguously attributed to grain boundary conduction highways thanks to the use of a powerful technique that can be straightforwardly extended to the study of currently inaccessible multiple nanoscale mass transport phenomena.

         <title>Emissive Charge&#8208;Transfer States at Hybrid Inorganic/Organic Heterojunctions Enable Low Non&#8208;Radiative Recombination and High&#8208;Performance Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient charge generation mediated by an emissive charge&#8208;transfer state is observed in hybrid heterojunctions comprising the inorganic semiconductor copper thiocyanate and common organic semiconductors. This enables the fabrication of solar cells with very low voltage losses and highly sensitive photodetectors that can detect sub&#8208;picowatt near&#8208;infrared light.








Abstract
Hybrid devices based on a heterojunction between inorganic and organic semiconductors have offered a means to combine the advantages of both classes of materials in optoelectronic devices, but, in practice, the performance of such devices has often been disappointing. Here, it is demonstrated that charge generation in hybrid inorganic&#8211;organic heterojunctions consisting of copper thiocyanate (CuSCN) and a variety of molecular acceptors (ITIC, IT&#8208;4F, Y6, PC70BM, C70, C60) proceeds via emissive charge&#8208;transfer (CT) states analogous to those found at all&#8208;organic heterojunctions. Importantly, contrary to what has been observed at previous organic&#8211;inorganic heterojunctions, the dissociation of the CT&#8208;exciton and subsequent charge separation is efficient, allowing the fabrication of planar photovoltaic devices with very low non&#8208;radiative voltage losses (0.21&#160;&#177; &#8197;0.02&#160;V). It is shown that such low non&#8208;radiative recombination enables the fabrication of simple and cost&#8208;effective near&#8208;IR (NIR) detectors with extremely low dark current (4 pA cm&#8722;2) and noise spectral density (3 fA Hz&#8722;1/2) at no external bias, leading to specific detectivities at NIR wavelengths of just under 1013 Jones, close to the performance of commercial silicon photodetectors. It is believed that this work demonstrates the possibility for hybrid heterojunctions to exploit the unique properties of both inorganic and organic semiconductors for high&#8208;performance opto&#8208;electronic devices.

         <title>Precise Subcellular Organelle Targeting for Boosting Endogenous&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Mediated Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The properties of the tumor microenvironment, the principle, methods, and the advantages of endogenous chemical substances stimulated tumor therapies and subcellular&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeting nanoplatforms are emphasized, which will provide attractive points toward the exploitation of precise medicines and clinical translation of multifunctional nanomedicines.








Abstract
Though numerous external&#8208;stimuli&#8208;triggered tumor therapies, including phototherapy, radiotherapy, and sonodynamic therapy have made great progress in cancer therapy, the low penetration depth of the laser, safety concerns of radiation, the therapeutic resistance, and the spatio&#8208;temporal constraints of the specific equipment restrict their convenient clinical applications. What is more, the inherent physiological barriers of the tumor microenvironment (TME), including hypoxia, heterogeneity, and high expression of antioxidant molecules also restrict the efficiency of tumor therapy. As a result, the development of nanoplatforms responsive to endogenous stimuli (such as glucose, acidic pH, cellular redox events, and etc.) has attracted great attention for starvation therapy, ion therapy, prodrug&#8208;mediated chemotherapy, or enzyme&#8208;catalyzed therapy. In addition, nanomedicines can be modified by some targeted units for precisely locating in subcellular organelles and boosting the destroying of tumor tissue, decreasing the dosage of nanoagents, reducing side effects, and enhancing the therapeutic efficiency. Herein, the properties of the TME, the advantages of endogenous stimuli, and the principles of subcellular&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeted strategies will be emphasized. Some necessary considerations for the exploitation of precision medicine and clinical translation of multifunctional nanomedicines in the future are also pointed out.

         <title>Bioactive Synthetic Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic polymers as intrinsically bioactive agents. This review presents new opportunities in the development of synthetic polymers with the ability to selectively recognize and bind biological targets, to exert anticancer and/or antibacterial activity, and others that can agglutinate or otherwise bind to viruses.








Abstract
Synthetic polymers are omnipresent in society as textiles and packaging materials, in construction and medicine, among many other important applications. Alternatively, natural polymers play a crucial role in sustaining life and allowing organisms to adapt to their environments by performing key biological functions such as molecular recognition and transmission of genetic information. In general, the synthetic and natural polymer worlds are completely separated due to the inability for synthetic polymers to perform specific biological functions; in some cases, synthetic polymers cause uncontrolled and unwanted biological responses. However, owing to the advancement of synthetic polymerization techniques in recent years, new synthetic polymers have emerged that provide specific biological functions such as targeted molecular recognition of peptides, or present antiviral, anticancer, and antimicrobial activities. In this review, the emergence of this generation of bioactive synthetic polymers and their bioapplications are summarized. Finally, the future opportunities in this area are discussed.

         <title>Optimized Photoclick (Bio)Resins for Fast Volumetric Bioprinting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Volumetric printing enables the generation of centimeter&#8208;sized free&#8208;form 3D objects within seconds. Optimized photoclick&#8208;based photoresins show ideal biophysical and photochemical properties resulting in fast and biocompatible volumetric bioprinting. Thiol&#8211;norbornene photo&#8208;crosslinking outperforms chain&#8208;growth systems permitting significant reduction of radical generation and polymer concentration. This simple and scalable synthesis method opens new avenues for widespread use of photoclick resins in light&#8208;mediated biofabrication.








Abstract
Volumetric printing (VP) is a light&#8208;mediated technique enabling printing of complex, low&#8208;defect 3D objects within seconds, overcoming major drawbacks of layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer additive manufacturing. An optimized photoresin is presented for VP in the presence of cells (volumetric bioprinting) based on fast thiol&#8211;ene step&#8208;growth photoclick crosslinking. Gelatin&#8208;norbornene (Gel&#8208;NB) photoresin shows superior performance, both in physicochemical and biocompatibility aspects, compared to (meth&#8208;)acryloyl resins. The extremely efficient thiol&#8211;norbornene reaction produces the fastest VP reported to date (&#8776;10 s), with significantly lower polymer content, degree of substitution (DS), and radical species, making it more suitable for cell encapsulation. This approach enables the generation of cellular free&#8208;form constructs with excellent cell viability (&#8776;100%) and tissue maturation potential, demonstrated by development of contractile myotubes. Varying the DS, polymer content, thiol&#8211;ene ratio, and thiolated crosslinker allows fine&#8208;tuning of mechanical properties over a broad stiffness range (&#8776;40&#160;Pa to &#8776;15&#160;kPa). These properties are achieved through fast and scalable methods for producing Gel&#8208;NB with inexpensive, off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf reagents that can help establish it as the gold standard for light&#8208;mediated biofabrication techniques. With potential applications from high&#8208;throughput bioprinting of tissue models to soft robotics and regenerative medicine, this work paves the way for exploitation of VPs unprecedented capabilities.

     alt="Optimized Photoclick (Bio)Resins for Fast Volumetric Bioprinting"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volumetric printing enables the generation of centimeter-sized free-form 3D objects within seconds. Optimized photoclick-based photoresins show ideal biophysical and photochemical properties resulting in fast and biocompatible volumetric bioprinting. Thiol&#8211;norbornene photo-crosslinking outperforms chain-growth systems permitting significant reduction of radical generation and polymer concentration. This simple and scalable synthesis method opens new avenues for widespread use of photoclick resins in light-mediated biofabrication.

         <title>Crystal Phase Transition Creates a Highly Active and Stable RuCX Nanosurface for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystal phase&#8208;transition of Ru/C from cubic&#8208;close&#8208;packing to hexagonal&#8208;close&#8208;packing creates a ruthenium carbide (RuCX, X&#160;&lt;&#160;1) nanosurface on Ru nanocrystal. The as&#8208;created RuCX nanosurface presents a highly active and stable performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media. Density functional theory calculations predict the RuCX sites as bifunctional configurations for improving alkaline HER kinetics.








Abstract
Although metastable crystal structures have received much attention owing to their utilization in various fields, their phase&#8208;transition to a thermodynamic structure has attracted comparably little interest. In the case of nanoscale crystals, such an exothermic phase&#8208;transition releases high energy within a confined surface area and reconstructs surface atomic arrangement in a short time. Thus, this high&#8208;energy nanosurface may create novel crystal structures when some elements are supplied. In this work, the creation of a ruthenium carbide (RuCX, X&#160;&lt;&#160;1) phase on the surface of the Ru nanocrystal is discovered during phase&#8208;transition from cubic&#8208;close&#8208;packed to hexagonal&#8208;close&#8208;packed structure. When the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is tested in alkaline media, the RuCX exhibits a much lower overpotential and good stability relative to the counterpart Ru&#8208;based catalysts and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C catalyst. Density functional theory calculations predict that the local heterogeneity of the outermost RuCX surface promotes the bifunctional HER mechanism by providing catalytic sites for both H adsorption and facile water dissociation.

         <title>Design and Demystify the Lithium Metal Interface towards Highly Reversible Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The reversible lithium (Li) plating/stripping is essentially required for building practical high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries based on Li metal chemistry, which unfortunately remains a severe challenge yet. In this contribution, we demonstrate that through the rational regulation of strong Li+&#8722;anion coordination structures in a highly compatible low&#8208;polarity solvent, 2&#8208;methyl tetrahydrofuran (MeTHF), the Li plating/stripping assisted by a nucleation modulation procedure delivers a remarkably high average Coulombic efficiency (CE) under rather demanding conditions (99.7% and 99.5% under 1.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 3.0 mAh cm&#8722;2 and 3.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 3.0 mAh cm&#8722;2, respectively). The exceedingly reversible cycling obtained herein is fundamentally correlated with the flattened Li deposition and minimized SEI generation/reconstruction in the customized condition, which notably restrains the growth rates of both dead Li0 (0.0120 mAh/cycle) and SEI&#8208;Li+ (0.0191 mAh/cycle) during consecutive cycles. Benefiting from the efficient Li plating/stripping manner, the assembled anode&#8208;free Cu|LiFePO4 (2.7 mAh cm&#8722;2) coin and pouch cells exhibit impressive capacity retention of 43.8% and 41.6% after 150 cycles, respectively, albeit no optimization on the test conditions. This work provides guidelines into the targeted interfacial design of high&#8208;efficiency working Li anode, aiming to pave the way for the practical deployment of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries.

         <title>Processing of Self&#8208;healing Polymers for Soft Robotics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Soft robots are, due to their softness, inherently safe and adapt well to unstructured environments. However, they are prone to various damage types. Self&#8208;healing polymers address this vulnerability. Self&#8208;healing soft robots can recover completely from macroscopic damage, extending their lifetime. For developing healable soft robots, various formative and additive manufacturing methods have been exploited to shape self&#8208;healing polymers into complex structures. Additionally, several novel manufacturing techniques, noted as (re)assembly binding techniques that are specific to self&#8208;healing polymers, have been created. This paper reviews the wide variety of processing techniques of self&#8208;healing polymers for robotics available in literature, and thoroughly discusses limitations and opportunities. Based on defined requirements for soft robots, these techniques are critically compared and validated. A strong focus is drawn to the reversible covalent and (physico)chemical cross&#8208;links present in the self&#8208;healing polymers that do not only endow healability to the resulting soft robotic components, but are also beneficial in many manufacturing techniques. They solve current obstacles in soft robots, including the formation of robust multi&#8208;material parts, recyclability and stress relaxation. This review bridges two promising research fields, and guides the reader towards selecting a suitable processing method based on a self&#8208;healing polymer and the intended soft robotics&#160;application.

         <title>Compensating electronic effect enables fast site&#8208;to&#8208;site electron transfer over ultrathin RuMn nanosheet branches toward highly electroactive and stable water splitting</title>

Abstract
To improve the electroactivity and stability of electrocatalysts, various modulation strategies have been applied in nanocatalysts. Among different methods, heteroatom doping has been considered as an effective method, which modifies the local bonding environments and the electronic structures. Meanwhile, the design of novel two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanostructures also offers new opportunities for achieving efficient electrocatalysts. In this work, Mn&#8208;doped ultrathin Ru nanosheet branches (RuMn NSBs), a newly reported 2D nanostructure, has been synthesized. With the ultrathin and naturally abundant edges, the RuMn NSBs have exhibited bifunctionalities of hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction with high electroactivity and durability in different electrolytes. Experimental characterizations have revealed that Ru&#8208;O bonds are shortened due to Mn doping, which is the key factor that leads to improved electrochemical performances. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have confirmed that the introduction of Mn enables flexible modulations on the valence states of Ru sites. The inversed redox state evolutions of Ru and Mn sites not only improve the electroactivity for the water splitting but also the long&#8208;term stability due to the pinning effect of Ru sites. This work has provided important inspirations for the design of future advanced Ru&#8208;based electrocatalysts with high performances and durability.

Abstract
The rational design of catalysts&#8217; spatial structure is vitally important to boost the catalytic performance through exposing the active sites, enhancing the mass transfer, and confining the reactants. Herein, a dual&#8208;linker zeolitic tetrazolate framework&#8208;engaged strategy is developed to construct assembled hollow plates (AHP) of N&#8208;rich carbon (NC), which is loaded with single&#8208;Ni atoms to form a highly efficient electrocatalyst (designated as Ni&#8208;NC(AHP)). In the carbonization process, the thermally unstable linker (5&#8208;aminotetrazole) serves as the self&#8208;sacrificial template and the other linker (2&#8208;methylimidazole) mainly serves as the carbon and nitrogen source to form hollow NC matrix. The formed Ni&#8208;NC(AHP) catalyst possesses enhanced mesoporosity and more available surface area, thus promoting mass transport and affording abundant accessible single&#8208;Ni sites. These features contribute to remarkable performance for electrochemical CO2 reduction with exceptionally high selectivity of nearly 100% towards CO in a wide potential range and dramatically enhanced CO partial current density.

         <title>Optoelectronic Properties of Low&#8208;Bandgap Halide Perovskites for Solar Cell Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;bandgap tin&#8208;containing halide perovskites have recently demonstrated impressive photovoltaic performances owing to their unique optoelectronic properties, which are yet to be fully explored. A perspective on the absorption, carrier generation, recombination, and transport phenomena in these materials is provided, underscoring an interesting interplay between doping, defects, and degradation that needs to be controlled for future optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Riding on the coat tails of rapid developments in single&#8208;junction halide perovskite solar cells, all&#8208;perovskite multijunction solar cells have recently garnered significant attention, with the highest power&#8208;conversion efficiency already reaching 25.6%. Much of this progress has been fueled by the rapid rise in the photovoltaic performance of low&#8208;bandgap halide perovskite absorbers, materials, which, to date, have only been achievable by the partial or complete substitution of lead with tin. However, much room still exists to develop a more critical understanding of key material properties in these low&#8208;bandgap perovskites. Herein, the key optoelectronic properties of absorption, carrier generation, recombination, and transport in these tin&#8208;containing perovskites are discussed, showing that intrinsic doping distinctively impacts many of these properties, thereby rendering this class of halide perovskites unique within the family. Current understanding of the mechanisms that degrade optoelectronic performance in these materials and the corresponding devices are also summarized. These collective results highlight an important interplay between doping, defects, and degradation that will need to be controlled. Finally, the current gaps in understanding of these low&#8208;bandgap perovskites are outlined, thereby providing guidelines for further research, which will unlock their full potential for realizing a plethora of high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Powered Piezo&#8208;Bioelectric Device Regulates Tendon Repair&#8208;Associated Signaling Pathways through Modulation of Mechanosensitive Ion Channels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under physiological conditions, ion&#8208;channels activity limit membrane depolarization and regulate ion concentration&#8208;dependent signaling cascades. In response to injury or mechanical loading, the activity and expression of the ion&#8208;channels increases, and unspecific tissue&#8208;repair signaling pathways activate, resulting in ectopic calcification. By modulating the mechanosensitive ion&#8208;channels&#8217; expression, electromechanical stimulation regulates specific signaling pathways activation to promote tendon over bone formation processes.








Abstract
Tendon disease constitutes an unmet clinical need and remains a critical challenge in the field of orthopaedic surgery. Innovative solutions are required to overcome the limitations of current tendon grafting approaches, and bioelectronic therapies show promise in treating musculoskeletal diseases, accelerating functional recovery through the activation of tissue regeneration&#8208;specific signaling pathways. Self&#8208;powered bioelectronic devices, particularly piezoelectric materials, represent a paradigm shift in biomedicine, negating the need for battery or external powering and complementing existing mechanotherapy to accelerate the repair processes. Here, the dynamic response of tendon cells to a piezoelectric collagen&#8208;analogue scaffold comprised of aligned nanoscale fibers made of the ferroelectric material poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene) is shown. It is demonstrated that motion&#8208;powered electromechanical stimulation of tendon tissue through piezo&#8208;bioelectric device results in ion channel modulation in vitro and regulates specific tissue regeneration signaling pathways. Finally, the potential of the piezo&#8208;bioelectronic device in modulating the progression of tendinopathy&#8208;associated processes in vivo, using a rat Achilles acute injury model is shown. This study indicates that electromechanical stimulation regulates mechanosensitive ion channel sensitivity and promotes tendon&#8208;specific over non&#8208;tenogenic tissue repair processes.

         <title>Electrochemistry&#8208;Induced Improvements of Mechanical Strength, Self&#8208;Healing, and Interfacial Adhesion of Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemistry strategy to enable functional improvements of hydrogels is reported. In comparison with an untreated one, the mechanical strength can be improved by 7.37 times, the interfacial adhesion energy to 1400 J m&#8722;2, and the healing efficiency to 100%, showing a general feature for the rapid generation of multifunctional hydrogels for biomedical and engineering applications.








Abstract
Hydrogels have demonstrated great potential in biomedical and engineering areas. To improve the physical performance, development of efficient physical/chemical protocols is essential. Herein, an electrochemistry functionalization strategy that is capable of enabling the functional improvements of hydrogel is reported. The electrochemistry functionalization is demonstrated on a hydrogel model of polyacrylamide (PAAm)@&#954;&#8208;carrageenan. The electrochemistry reaction generates metal ions (Fe3+) that migrate and coordinate with the sulfate groups of &#954;&#8208;carrageenan resulting in the prominent function improvements. In comparison with untreated PAAm@&#954;&#8208;carrageenan hydrogel, it can improve the mechanical strength by 7.37 times, and can increase the interfacial adhesion energy of the hydrogel on a glass surface from 0 to 1400 J m&#8722;2, stronger than the bonding strength of tendons (adhesion energy: &#8776;800 J m&#8722;2). Two pieces of hydrogel strips integrate into an intact structure by the electrochemistry functionalization, where the healing efficiency reaches 100% in comparison to the untreated hydrogel. The most significant development is that it enables functional patterning on the hydrogel by the electrode assembly, which provides the hydrogel with modular sensitivity to external pressure. Therefore, it can be a general protocol for rapid generation of multifunctional hydrogels for biomedical and engineering developments.

         <title>Large&#8208;Sized Graphene Oxide Nanosheets Increase DC&#8211;T&#8208;Cell Synaptic Contact and the Efficacy of DC Vaccines against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel material&#8208;based method of regulating dendritic cell (DC)&#8211;T&#8208;cell synaptic contact for adoptive DC vaccine engineering is reported. Graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets serve as a &#8220;nanozipper&#8221; or &#8220;double&#8208;sided tape&#8221; facilitating the formation and aggregation of DC&#8211;T&#8208;cell immune synapses to elicit robust cytotoxic T cell immune responses against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection. Cytoskeleton&#8208;dependent membrane&#8208;positioning of intercellular cell adhesion molecule&#8208;1 (ICAM&#8208;1) might be the underlying mechanism.








Abstract
Dendritic cell (DC) vaccines are used for cancer and infectious diseases, albeit with limited efficacy. Modulating the formation of DC&#8211;T&#8208;cell synapses may greatly increase their efficacy. The effects of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets on DCs and DC&#8211;T&#8208;cell synapse formation are evaluated. In particular, size&#8208;dependent interactions are observed between GO nanosheets and DCs. GOs with diameters of &gt;1 &#181;m (L&#8208;GOs) demonstrate strong adherence to the DC surface, inducing cytoskeletal reorganization via the RhoA&#8208;ROCK&#8208;MLC pathway, while relatively small GOs (&#8776;500 nm) are predominantly internalized by DCs. Furthermore, L&#8208;GO treatment enhances DC&#8211;T&#8208;cell synapse formation via cytoskeleton&#8208;dependent membrane positioning of integrin ICAM&#8208;1. L&#8208;GO acts as a &#8220;nanozipper,&#8221; facilitating the aggregation of DC&#8211;T&#8208;cell clusters to produce a stable microenvironment for T cell activation. Importantly, L&#8208;GO&#8208;adjuvanted DCs promote robust cytotoxic T cell immune responses against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike 1, leading to &gt;99.7% viral RNA clearance in mice infected with a clinically isolated SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 strain. These findings highlight the potential value of nanomaterials as DC vaccine adjuvants for modulating DC&#8211;T&#8208;cell synapse formation and provide a basis for the development of effective COVID&#8208;19 vaccines.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dendritic cell (DC) vaccines are used for cancer and infectious diseases, albeit with limited efficacy. Modulating the formation of DC&#8211;T-cell synapses may greatly increase their efficacy. The effects of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets on DCs and DC&#8211;T-cell synapse formation are evaluated. In particular, size-dependent interactions are observed between GO nanosheets and DCs. GOs with diameters of &amp;gt;1 &#181;m (L-GOs) demonstrate strong adherence to the DC surface, inducing cytoskeletal reorganization via the RhoA-ROCK-MLC pathway, while relatively small GOs (&#8776;500 nm) are predominantly internalized by DCs. Furthermore, L-GO treatment enhances DC&#8211;T-cell synapse formation via cytoskeleton-dependent membrane positioning of integrin ICAM-1. L-GO acts as a &#8220;nanozipper,&#8221; facilitating the aggregation of DC&#8211;T-cell clusters to produce a stable microenvironment for T cell activation. Importantly, L-GO-adjuvanted DCs promote robust cytotoxic T cell immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 spike 1, leading to &amp;gt;99.7% viral RNA clearance in mice infected with a clinically isolated SARS-CoV-2 strain. These findings highlight the potential value of nanomaterials as DC vaccine adjuvants for modulating DC&#8211;T-cell synapse formation and provide a basis for the development of effective COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reproducible X&#8208;ray Imaging with a Perovskite Nanocrystal Scintillator Embedded in a Transparent Amorphous Network Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;limited growth strategy is proposed to construct CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, which features X&#8208;imaging with excellent resolution (16.8&#160;lp&#160;mm&#8722;1). More importantly, the blurred X&#8208;ray images of the damaged perovskite NCs, due to irradiation at high dose rate, are well refreshed by a thermal treatment. This discovery broadens the research and application of the scintillators and opens a new chapter.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites are emerging scintillator materials in X&#8208;ray detection and imaging. However, the vulnerable structure of perovskites triggers unreliable performance when they are utilized in X&#8208;ray detectors under cumulative dose irradiation. Herein, a self&#8208;limited growth strategy is proposed to construct CsPbBr3 nanocrystals that are embedded in a transparent amorphous network structure, featuring X&#8208;imaging with excellent resolution (&#8776;16.8&#160;lp&#160;mm&#8722;1), and fast decay time (&#964;&#160;=&#160;27&#160;ns). Interestingly, it is found that the performance degradation of the scintillator, caused by the damage from high&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation, can be fully recovered after a facile thermal treatment process. This indicates a superior recycling behavior of the explored perovskites scintillator for practical applications. The recoverability of the as&#8208;explored scintillator is attributed to the low atom&#8208;migration rate in the amorphous network with high&#8208;viscosity (1&#160;&#215;&#160;1014&#160;cP). This result highlights the practical settlement of the promising perovskites for long&#8208;term, cost&#8208;effective scintillator devices.

         <title>Adaptive Cylindrical Wireless Metasurfaces in Clinical Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metasurface with homogeneous field distribution and nonlinear resonant modes is proposed. Adaptability is achieved using nonlinear elements, enabling the metasurface to be applicable to all clinical sequences without any parameters modified, also allowing two to four times signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio enhancement. The proposed design paves the way for the clinical applications of metasurfaces in magnetic resonance imaging.








Abstract
The signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) is one of the most important criteria for evaluating the image quality in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and metasurfaces with unique electromagnetic properties provide a novel method for SNR improvement. However, their applications in clinical MRI are highly restricted by the inhomogeneous enhancement of the magnetic field and interference in the radio frequency (RF) transmitting field. In this study, an adaptive cylindrical wireless metasurface (ACWM) with homogeneous field enhancement and adaptive resonant modes is reported. The ACWM automatically switches its resonant modes between the partial (transmitting period) and whole (receiving period) resonance, which enables it to not only eliminate the interference in RF transmitting field, but also greatly enhance the SNR. Its adaptability also makes the ACWM applicable to all common clinical sequences without any modifications in the scan parameters. The SNR of MRI images of the human wrist, acquired with ACWM, is two to four times compared with the conventional coil. This work offers a practical control method to fill the scientific knowledge gaps between the preclinical research and medical applications for metasurfaces, and suggests a novel and powerful tool for diagnosing and evaluating human diseases.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Membrane&#8208;Derived Nanoparticles with Notch&#8208;1 Suppressor Delivery Promote Hypoxic Cell&#8211;Cell Packing and Inhibit Angiogenesis Acting as a Two&#8208;Edged Sword</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell&#8208;derived nanoparticles (CMNPs) promote physical tightening of cell&#8211;cell interactions and cell packing, thereby inducing hypoxia as a favorable setting for cancer progression and cartilage development. The conjugation of aptamers to CMNPs suppresses Notch&#8208;1 signaling&#8208;mediated angiogenesis with consequent activation of anti&#8208;cancer and chondroprotective effects (&#8220;two&#8208;edged sword&#8221;) in a xenograft model of human laryngeal cancer.








Abstract
Cell&#8211;cell interactions regulate intracellular signaling via reciprocal contacts of cell membranes in tissue regeneration and cancer growth, indicating a critical need of membrane&#8208;derived tools in studying these processes. Hence, cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;derived nanoparticles (CMNPs) are produced using tonsil&#8208;derived mesenchymal stem cells (TMSCs) from children owing to their short doubling time. As target cell types, laryngeal cancer cells are compared to&#160;bone&#8208;marrow&#8208;derived MSCs (BMSCs) because of their cartilage damaging and chondrogenic characteristics, respectively. Treating spheroids of these cell types with CMNPs exacerbates&#160;interspheroid&#160;hypoxia with robust maintenance of the cell&#8211;cell interaction signature for 7 days. Both cell types prefer a hypoxic environment, as opposed to blood vessel formation that is absent in cartilage but is required for cancer growth. Hence, angiogenesis is inhibited by displaying the Notch&#8208;1 aptamer on CMNPs. Consequently, laryngeal cancer growth is suppressed efficiently in contrast to improved chondroprotection observed in a series of cell and animal experiments using a xenograft mouse model of laryngeal cancer.&#160;Altogether, CMNPs execute&#160;a two&#8208;edged sword function of&#160;inducing hypoxic cell&#8211;cell packing, followed by suppressing angiogenesis to promote&#160;laryngeal cancer death and chondrogenesis&#160;simultaneously.&#160;This study presents a previously unexplored therapeutic strategy for anti&#8208;cancer and chondroprotective treatment using CMNPs.

         <title>Exceptionally High Blocking Temperature of 17 K in a Surface&#8208;Supported Molecular Magnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sub&#8208;monolayers of Dy2@C80(CH2Ph) dimetallofullerene single&#8208;molecule magnets are prepared on a graphene monolayer by electrospray deposition. Magnetic hysteresis and relaxation time measurements show that the magnetic moment remains stable for 100 s at 17 K, marking the blocking temperature TB(100), being not only in excellent agreement with that of the bulk but also representing by far the highest one detected for a surface&#8208;supported single&#8208;molecule magnet.








Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) are among the most promising building blocks for future magnetic data storage or quantum computing applications, owing to magnetic bistability and long magnetic relaxation times. The practical device integration requires realization of 2D surface assemblies of SMMs, where each magnetic unit shows magnetic relaxation being sufficiently slow at application&#8208;relevant temperatures. Using X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray magnetic circular dichroism, it is shown that sub&#8208;monolayers of Dy2@C80(CH2Ph) dimetallofullerenes prepared on graphene by electrospray deposition exhibit magnetic behavior fully comparable to that of the bulk. Magnetic hysteresis and relaxation time measurements show that the magnetic moment remains stable for 100 s at 17 K, marking the blocking temperature TB(100), being not only in excellent agreement with that of the bulk sample but also representing by far the highest one detected for a surface&#8208;supported single&#8208;molecule magnet. The reported findings give a boost to the efforts to stabilize and address the spin degree of freedom in molecular magnets aiming at the realization of SMM&#8208;based spintronic units.

         <title>Evaporation&#8208;Induced rGO Coatings for Highly Sensitive and Non&#8208;Invasive Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer in the PSA Gray Zone</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A circulating tumor cell (CTC)&#8208;chip based on evaporation&#8208;induced wrinkled reduced graphene oxide coating can achieve highly sensitive and non&#8208;invasive diagnosis of prostate cancer in the prostate&#8208;specific antigen (PSA) gray zone. Compared with the low diagnostic sensitivity (58.3%) of regular PSA&#8208;based tests, a combination of CTC detection and PSA&#8208;based tests via machine&#8208;learning analysis can greatly upgrade the diagnostic sensitivity of this disease to 91.7%.








Abstract
The prostate&#8208;specific antigen (PSA) has been widely used for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer during routine check&#8208;ups. However, the low sensitivity of regular PSA tests in the PSA gray zone often means that patients are required to undergo further invasive needle biopsy for the diagnosis of prostate cancer, which may lead to potential overdiagnosis and overtreatment. In this study, a circulating tumor cell (CTC)&#8208;chip based on an evaporation&#8208;induced reduced graphene oxide (rGO) coating is presented, which enables a highly specific and non&#8208;invasive diagnosis of prostate cancer in the PSA gray zone. During the evaporation process of the rGO dispersion, the Marangoni effect induces the self&#8208;assembly of a hierarchical micro/nanowrinkled rGO coating, which can capture CTCs after subsequent surface modification of capture agents. Compared to the low diagnostic sensitivity (58.3%) of regular PSA tests, a combination of CTC detection and PSA&#8208;based hematological tests via machine&#8208;learning analysis can greatly upgrade the diagnostic sensitivity of this disease to 91.7% in clinical trial. Therefore, this study provides a non&#8208;invasive alternative with high sensitivity for the diagnosis of prostate cancer in the PSA gray zone.

         <title>Fused&#8208;Silica 3D Chiral Metamaterials via Helium&#8208;Assisted Microcasting Supporting Topologically Protected Twist Edge Resonances with High Mechanical Quality Factors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel helium&#8208;assisted microcasting approach is introduced to fabricate 3D fused&#8208;silica microstructures. For a 3D chiral fused&#8208;silica metamaterial beam, the existence of topologically protected twist&#8208;edge resonances with large mechanical quality factors of 2850 is demonstrated. The microcasting approach can likely be translated to many other materials, and to complex architectures that are not amenable to direct 3D laser printing.








Abstract
It is predicted theoretically that a 1D diatomic chain of 3D chiral cells can support a topological bandgap that allows for translating a small time&#8208;harmonic axial movement at one end of the chain into a resonantly enhanced large rotation of an edge state at the other end. This edge state is topologically protected such that an arbitrary mass of a mirror at the other end does not shift the eigenfrequency out of the bandgap. Herein, this complex 3D laser&#8208;beam&#8208;scanner microstructure is realized in fused&#8208;silica form. A novel microcasting approach is introduced that starts from a hollow polymer cast made by standard 3D laser nanoprinting. The cast is evacuated and filled with helium, such that a highly viscous commercial glass slurry is sucked in. After UV curing and thermal debinding of the polymer, the fused&#8208;silica glass is sintered at 1225&#160;&#176;C under vacuum. Detailed optical measurements reveal a mechanical quality factor of the twist&#8208;edge resonance of 2850 at around 278&#160;kHz resonance frequency under ambient conditions. The microcasting approach can likely be translated to many other glasses, to metals and ceramics, and to complex architectures that are not or not yet amenable to direct 3D laser printing.

         <title>Manipulating the Local Coordination and Electronic Structures for Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic Ni&#8211;Fe selenide&#8208;derived (oxy)hydroxide nanocage electrocatalysts are in situ generated by inheriting the structure of the pre&#8208;catalyst. The successful manipulation of the local coordination and electronic structures of the electrocatalyst enables superior electrocatalytic activity and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based nanomaterials can exhibit extraordinary electrocatalytic performance toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by harnessing the structural evolution during catalysis and the synergistic effect between elements. However, the structure of active centers in bimetallic/multimetallic catalysts is under long&#8208;time debate in the catalysis community. Here, an efficient bimetallic Ni&#8211;Fe selenide&#8208;derived OER electrocatalyst is reported and the structure&#8211;activity correlation during the OER evolution studied. By combining experiments and theoretical calculations,&#160;a conceptual advance is provided, in that the local coordination structure distortion and disordering of active sites inherited from the pre&#8208;catalyst and post&#8208;formed by a further reconstruction are responsible for boosting the OER performance. The active center is identified on Ni sites showing moderate bindings with oxygenous intermediates rather than Fe sites with strong and poisonous adsorptions. These findings provide crucial understanding in manipulating the local coordination and electronic structures toward rational design and fabrication of efficient OER electrocatalysts.

         <title>Optimizing Electronic Quality Factor toward High&#8208;Performance Ge1&#8722;x&#8722;yTaxSbyTe Thermoelectrics: The Role of Transition Metal Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nexus between electronic quality factor and thermoelectric figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;doped GeTe, which can serve as a facile yet efficient descriptor for high&#8208;throughput screening of good thermoelectric materials, is explained. To clarify this point, Ta&#8208;doped GeTe is designed with optimized electronic quality factor, rendering a figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit over 2.0 and a conceptional efficiency over 15%.








Abstract
Owing to high intrinsic figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit implemented by multi&#8208;band valleytronics, GeTe&#8208;based thermoelectric materials are promising for medium&#8208;temperature applications. Transition metals are widely used as dopants for developing high&#8208;performance GeTe thermoelectric materials. Herein, relevant work is critically reviewed to establish a correlation among transition metal doping, electronic quality factor, and figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit of GeTe. From first&#8208;principle calculations, it is found that Ta, as an undiscovered dopant in GeTe, can effectively converge energy offset between light and heavy conduction band extrema to enhance effective mass at high temperature. Such manipulation is verified by the increased Seebeck coefficient of synthesized Ge1&#8722;x&#8722;yTaxSbyTe samples from 160 to 180 &#181;V K&#8722;1 at 775 K upon doping Ta, then to 220 &#181;V K&#8722;1 with further alloying Sb. Characterization using electron microscopy also reveals the unique herringbone structure associated with multi&#8208;scale lattice defects induced by Ta doping, which greatly hinder phonon propagation to decrease thermal conductivity. As a result, a figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit of &#8776;2.0 is attained in the Ge0.88Ta0.02Sb0.10Te sample, reflecting a maximum heat&#8208;to&#8208;electricity efficiency up to 17.7% under a temperature gradient of 400 K. The rationalized beneficial effects stemming from Ta doping is an important observation that will stimulate new exploration toward high&#8208;performance GeTe&#8208;based thermoelectric materials.

         <title>A Powerful One&#8208;Step Puffing Carbonization Method for Construction of Versatile Carbon Composites with High&#8208;Efficiency Energy Storage</title>

A powerful one&#8208;step puffing carbonization technology is proposed to synthesize versatile multiscale carbon&#8208;based composites (e.g. carbon/metal oxides, carbon/metal carbides, carbon/metal sulfides, carbon/metals, metal/semiconductors, etc.) with controlled morphology, adjustable dimensions and tunable composition on a large scale. As a representative example, a sulfur&#8208;doped cross&#8208;linked puffed carbon (SCPC)/Li2S electrode shows extraordinary performance with superior rate capability and ultrastable cycling life.








Abstract
Carbon materials play a critical role in the advancement of electrochemical energy storage and conversion. Currently, it is still a great challenge to fabricate versatile carbon&#8208;based composites with controlled morphology, adjustable dimension, and tunable composition by a one&#8208;step synthesis process. In this work, a powerful one&#8208;step maltose&#8208;based puffing carbonization technology is reported to construct multiscale carbon&#8208;based composites on large scale. A quantity of composite examples (e.g., carbon/metal oxides, carbon/metal nitrides, carbon/metal carbides, carbon/metal sulfides, carbon/metals, metal/semiconductors, carbon/carbons) are prepared and demonstrated with required properties. These well&#8208;designed composites show advantages of large porosity, hierarchical porous structure, high conductivity, tunable components, and proportion. The formation mechanism of versatile carbon composites is attributed to the puffing&#8208;carbonization of maltose plus in situ carbothermal reaction between maltose and precursors. As a representative example, Li2S is in situ implanted into a hierarchical porous cross&#8208;linked puffed carbon (CPC) matrix to verify its application in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. The designed S&#8208;doped CPC/Li2S cathode shows superior electrochemical performance with higher rate capacity (621 mAh g&#8211;1 at 2 C), smaller polarization and enhanced long&#8208;term cycles as compared to other counterparts. The research provides a general way for the construction of multifunctional component&#8208;adjustable carbon composites for advanced energy storage and conversion.

         <title>Rational Design of Highly Stable and Active MXene&#8208;Based Bifunctional ORR/OER Double&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni1/Ni2&#8208; and Fe1/Ni2&#8208;modified MXene&#8208;based double&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) show the most promising bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic performances. The bifunctional catalytic activities of DACs improve with increasing strain. Theoretical models are presented for plotting the polarization curves of OER/ORR catalysis to demonstrate the bifunctional catalytic performance of the studied catalysts.








Abstract
Designing highly active and bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts has attracted great interest toward metal&#8211;air batteries. Herein, an efficient solution to the search for MXene&#8208;based bifunctional catalysts is proposed by introducing non&#8208;noble metals such as Fe/Co/Ni at the surfaces. These results indicate that the ultrahigh activities in Ni1/Ni2&#8208; and Fe1/Ni2&#8208;modified MXene&#8208;based double&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) for bifunctional ORR/OER are better than those of well&#8208;known unifunctional catalysts with low overpotentials, such as Pt(111) for the ORR and IrO2(110) for the OER. Strain can profoundly regulate the catalytic activities of MXene&#8208;based DACs, providing a novel pathway for tunable catalytic behavior in flexible MXenes. An electrochemical model, based on density functional theory and theoretical polarization curves, is proposed to reveal the underlying mechanisms, in agreement with experimental results. Electronic structure analyses indicate that the excellent catalytic activities in the MXene&#8208;based DACs are attributed to the electron&#8208;capturing capability and synergistic interactions between Fe/Co/Ni adsorbents and MXene substrate. These findings not only reveal promising candidates for MXene&#8208;based bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts but also provide new theoretical insights into rationally designing noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free bifunctional DACs.

         <title>Orbital Angular Momentum from Self&#8208;Assembled Concentric Nanoparticle Rings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Concentric rings of plasmonic nanoparticles are fabricated by self&#8208;assembling supramolecular nanocomposites on lithographically patterned surfaces. After assembly, the arrays of concentric rings generate high&#8208;quality orbital angular momentum (OAM). Due to their unique ability to self&#8208;regulate the distribution of each building block, supramolecular nanocomposites are a robust assembly platform. In this work, they accommodate variations in pattern dimension, nanoparticle loading, and nanoparticle ring size.








Abstract
Ring&#8208;shaped nanostructures can focus, filter, and manipulate electromagnetic waves, but are challenging to incorporate into devices using standard nanofabrication techniques. Directed self&#8208;assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) on lithographically patterned templates has successfully been used to fabricate concentric rings and spirals as etching masks. However, this method is limited by BCP phase behavior and material selection. Here, a straightforward approach to generate ring&#8208;shaped nanoparticle assemblies in thin films of supramolecular nanocomposites is demonstrated. DSA is used to guide the formation of concentric rings with radii spanning 150&#8211;1150&#160;nm and ring widths spanning 30&#8211;60&#160;nm. When plasmonic nanoparticles are used, ring nanodevice arrays can be fabricated in one step, and the completed devices produce high&#8208;quality orbital angular momentum (OAM). Nanocomposite DSA simplifies and streamlines nanofabrication by producing metal structures without etching or deposition steps; it also introduces interparticle coupling as a new design axis. Detailed analysis of the nanoparticle ring assemblies confirms that the supramolecular system self&#8208;regulates the spatial distribution of its components, and thus exhibits a degree of flexibility absent in DSA of BCPs alone, where structures are determined by polymer&#8208;pattern incommensurability. The present studies also provide guidelines for developing self&#8208;regulating DSA as an alternative to incommensurability&#8208;driven methods.

         <title>A Supramolecular Antidote to Macromolecular Toxins Prepared through Coassembly of Macrocyclic Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular detoxification is an emerging strategy for treating poisoning; however, developing supramolecular therapeutic materials as an antidote to macromolecular toxins is challenging. To overcome this challenge, a heteromultivalent coassembling material (CCA&#8208;CD) comprising macrocyclic amphiphiles is developed. The CCA&#8208;CD binds with melittin strongly and selectively, and significantly alleviates its toxicity, serving as a novel supramolecular antidote used for melittin poisoning treatment.








Abstract
Poisoning is a leading cause of admission to medical emergency departments and intensive care units. Supramolecular detoxification, which involves injecting supramolecular receptors that bind with toxins to suppress their biological activity, is an emerging strategy for poisoning treatment; it has few requirements and a broad application scope. However, it is still a formidable challenge to design supramolecular therapeutic materials as an antidote to macromolecular toxins, because the large size, flexible conformation, and presence of multiple and diverse binding sites of biomacromolecules hinder their recognition. Herein, a supramolecular antidote to macromolecular toxins is developed through the coassembly of macrocyclic amphiphiles, relying on heteromultivalent recognition between the coassembled components and toxic macromolecules. The coassembly of amphiphilic cyclodextrin and calixarene strongly and selectively captures melittin, a toxin studied herein; this imparts various therapeutic effects such as inhibiting the interactions of melittin with cell membranes, alleviating melittin cytotoxicity and hemolytic toxicity, reducing the mortality rate of melittin&#8208;poisoned mice, and mitigating damage to major organs. The use of the proposed antidote overcomes the limitation of supramolecular detoxification applicability to only small&#8208;molecular toxins. The antidote can also detoxify other macromolecular toxins as long as selective and strong binding is achieved because of the coassembling tunability.

         <title>3D Temporary&#8208;Magnetized Soft Robotic Structures for Enhanced Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a mechanically guided, compressive&#8208;buckling process, a set of judiciously engineered 3D soft robotic structures can be developed based on magnetic materials. Under the precise control of the external magnetic&#8208;field, the temporary&#8208;magnetized 3D structures can achieve various tethered locomotion. Further integration with functional devices (piezoelectric energy harvester, solar cell) allows for enhanced energy harvesting, and potentially multimodal sensing and robotic interfaces.








Abstract
The advent of functional materials offers tremendous potential in a broad variety of areas such as electronics, robotics, and energy devices. Magnetic materials are an attractive candidate that enable multifunctional devices with capabilities in both sensing and actuation.

&lt;p&gt;Through a mechanically guided, compressive-buckling process, a set of judiciously engineered 3D soft robotic structures can be developed based on magnetic materials. Under the precise control of the external magnetic-field, the temporary-magnetized 3D structures can achieve various tethered locomotion. Further integration with functional devices (piezoelectric energy harvester, solar cell) allows for enhanced energy harvesting, and potentially multimodal sensing and robotic interfaces.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advent of functional materials offers tremendous potential in a broad variety of areas such as electronics, robotics, and energy devices. Magnetic materials are an attractive candidate that enable multifunctional devices with capabilities in both sensing and actuation. However, current magnetic devices, especially those with complex motion modalities, rely on permanently magnetized materials with complicated, non-uniform magnetization profiles. Here, based on magnetic materials with temporary-magnetization, a mechanically guided assembly process successfully converts laser-patterned 2D magnetic materials into judiciously engineered 3D structures, with dimensions and geometries ranging from mesoscale 3D filaments, to arrayed centimeter-scale 3D membranes. With tailorable mechanical properties and highly adjustable geometries, 3D soft structures can exhibit various tethered locomotions under the precise control of magnetic fields, including local deformation, unidirectional tilting, and omnidirectional rotation, and can serve as dynamic surfaces for further integration with other functional materials or devices.

         <title>Sweet Electronics: Honey&#8208;Gated Complementary Organic Transistors and Circuits Operating in Air</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of edible electronics devices requires unconventional solutions, in particular, the use of functional food&#8208;based materials in the design. An inherently safe and nutritive compound, honey, is hereby proposed as an effective gating medium for the realization of air&#8208;stable complementary organic transistors and circuits operating at low voltage (&lt;1&#160;V) and featuring other distinctive electronic functionalities.








Abstract
Sustainable harnessing of natural resources is key moving toward a new&#8208;generation electronics, which features a unique combination of electronic functionality, low cost, and absence of environmental and health hazards. Within this framework, edible electronics, of which transistors and circuits are a fundamental component, is an emerging field, exploiting edible materials that can be safely ingested, and subsequently digested after performing their function. Dielectrics are a critical functional element of transistors, often constituting their major volume. Yet, to date, there are only scarce examples of electrolytic food&#8208;based materials able to provide low&#8208;voltage operation of transistors at ambient conditions. In this context, a cost&#8208;effective and edible substance, honey, is proposed to be used as an electrolytic gate viscous dielectric in electrolyte&#8208;gated organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). Both n&#8208; and p&#8208;type honey&#8208;gated OFETs (HGOFETs) are demonstrated, with distinctive features such as low voltage (&lt;1 V)&#160;operation, long&#8208;term shelf life and operation stability in air, and compatibility with large&#8208;area fabrication processes, such as inkjet printing on edible tattoo&#8208;paper. Such complementary devices enable robust honey&#8208;based integrated logic circuits, here exemplified by inverting logic gates and ring oscillators. A marked device responsivity to humidity provides promising opportunities for sensing applications, specifically, for moisture control of dried or dehydrated food.

         <title>Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of Organic Core/Multi&#8208;Shell Microwires for Trichromatic White&#8208;Light Sources</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>

Through regulating the noncovalent interactions between organic semiconductor molecules (|ECT, DgpC&#8208;TCNB = &#8722;18.35&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1|&#160;&gt;&#160;|ECT, DgpC&#8208;TFP = &#8722;13.45&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1|&#160;&gt;&#160;|E&#960;&#8211;&#960;, DgpC = &#8722;6.81&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1|), a hierarchical self&#8208;assembly approach of horizontal epitaxial&#8208;growth is demonstrated for the precise synthesis of organic core/double&#8208;shell microwires with radial red&#8211;green&#8211;blue (RGB) substructures for miniaturized white&#8208;light sources (CIE [0.34, 0.36]).








Abstract
White&#8208;light&#8208;emissive organic micro/nanostructures hold exotic potential applications in full&#8208;color displays, on&#8208;chip wavelength&#8208;division multiplexing, and backlights of portable display devices, but are rarely realized in organic core/shell heterostructures. Herein, through regulating the noncovalent interactions between organic semiconductor molecules, a hierarchical self&#8208;assembly approach of horizontal epitaxial&#8208;growth is demonstrated for the fine synthesis of organic core/mono&#8208;shell microwires with multicolor emission (red&#8211;green, red&#8211;blue, and green&#8211;blue) and especially organic core/double&#8208;shell microwires with radial red&#8211;green&#8211;blue (RGB) emission, whose components are dibenzo[g,p]chrysene (DgpC)&#8208;based charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complexes. In fact, the desired lattice mismatching (&#8776;2%) and the excellent structure compatibility of these CT complexes facilitate the epitaxial&#8208;growth process for the facile synthesis of organic core/shell microwires. With the RGB&#8208;emissive substructures, these core/double&#8208;shell organic microwires are microscale white&#8208;light sources (CIE [0.34, 0.36]). Besides, the white&#8208;emissive core/double&#8208;shell microwires demonstrate the fascinating full&#8208;spectrum light transportation from 400 to 700&#160;nm. This work indeed opens up a novel avenue for the accurate construction of organic core/shell heterostructures, which provides an attractive platform for the organic integrated optoelectronics.

         <title>Time&#8211;Temperature Integrating Optical Sensors Based on Gradient Colloidal Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A colloidal stopband&#8208;based time&#8211;temperature integrator is introduced, which can monitor the thermal history of a specific system over an adjustable time and temperature range. The fabrication of a binary colloidal crystal gradient comprising same&#8208;sized, monodisperse particles with distinct glass transition temperatures are the key components for this type of integrating sensor.








Abstract
Manipulation&#8208;free and autonomous recording of temperature states for extended periods of time is of increasing importance for food spoilage and battery safety assessment. An optical readout is preferred for low&#8208;tech visual inspection. Here, a concept for time&#8211;temperature integrators based on colloidal crystals is introduced. Two unique features in this class of advanced materials are combined: 1) the film&#8208;formation kinetics can be controlled by orders of magnitude based on mixtures of particles with distinct glass transition temperatures. 2) A gradual variation of the particle mixture along a linear gradient of the colloidal crystal enables local readout. Tailor&#8208;made latex particles of identical size but different glass transition temperatures provide a homogenous photonic stopband. The disappearance of this opalescence is directly related to the local particle ratio and the exposure to a time and temperature combination. This sensing material can be adjusted to report extended intermediate and short excessive temperature events, which makes it specifically suitable for long&#8208;term tracing and threshold applications.

         <title>3D Printing of Elastomeric Bioinspired Complex Adhesive Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D&#8208;printing&#8208;based fabrication approach is utilized for creating complex elastomeric microstructural adhesives directly. Two hybrid bioinspired structure designs are demonstrated, combining the strengths of gecko&#8208;inspired microfiber adhesives with springtail&#8208; and octopus&#8208;inspired microstructures to enable complex adhesives toward various real&#8208;world applications.








Abstract
Bioinspired elastomeric structural adhesives can provide reversible and controllable adhesion on dry/wet and synthetic/biological surfaces for a broad range of commercial applications. Shape complexity and performance of the existing structural adhesives are limited by the used specific fabrication technique, such as molding. To overcome these limitations by proposing complex 3D microstructured adhesive designs, a 3D elastomeric microstructure fabrication approach is implemented using two&#8208;photon&#8208;polymerization&#8208;based 3D printing. A custom aliphatic urethane&#8208;acrylate&#8208;based elastomer is used as the 3D printing material. Two designs are demonstrated with two combined biological inspirations to show the advanced capabilities enabled by the proposed fabrication approach and custom elastomer. The first design focuses on springtail&#8208; and gecko&#8208;inspired hybrid microfiber adhesive, which has the multifunctionalities of side&#8208;surface liquid super&#8208;repellency, top&#8208;surface liquid super&#8208;repellency, and strong reversible adhesion features in a single fiber array. The second design primarily centers on octopus&#8208; and gecko&#8208;inspired hybrid adhesive, which exhibits the benefits of both octopus&#8208; and gecko&#8208;inspired microstructured adhesives for strong reversible adhesion on both wet and dry surfaces, such as skin. This fabrication approach could be used to produce many other 3D complex elastomeric structural adhesives for future real&#8208;world applications.

The first design focuses on springtail- and gecko-inspired hybrid microfiber adhesive, which has the multifunctionalities of side-surface liquid super-repellency, top-surface liquid super-repellency, and strong reversible adhesion features in a single fiber array. The second design primarily centers on octopus- and gecko-inspired hybrid adhesive, which exhibits the benefits of both octopus- and gecko-inspired microstructured adhesives for strong reversible adhesion on both wet and dry surfaces, such as skin. This fabrication approach could be used to produce many other 3D complex elastomeric structural adhesives for future real-world applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Crosslinked Dynamic Hydrogel Incorporating {Mo154} with pH and NIR Responsiveness for Chemo&#8208;Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual pH&#8208; and near infra&#8208;red (NIR)&#8208;responsive hydrogel is developed composed of benzylaldehyde functionalized poly(ethylene glycol), poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) functionalized chitosan, and a polyoxometalate {Mo154}. Crosslinked by Schiff base and electrostatic interactions, the hydrogel has dynamic networks, injectability, and fast self&#8208;healing properties. Combining doxorubicin and NIR laser irradiation, the hydrogel shows thermal ablation of cancer cells and simultaneous release of drugs for chemo&#8208;photothermal therapy.








Abstract
Polyoxometalates are an emerging class of molecular clusters, with well&#8208;defined structures and chemical compositions that are produced through simple, low&#8208;cost, and highly reproducible methods. In particular, the wheel&#8208;shaped cluster {Mo154} is a promising photothermal agent due to its intervalence charge transfer transitions. However, its toxicity hinders its systemic administration, being the development of a localized delivery system still incipient. Herein, an injectable and self&#8208;healing hydrogel of easy preparation and administration is developed, incorporating both {Mo154} and doxorubicin for synergistic photothermal and chemotherapy applications. The hydrogel is composed of benzylaldehyde functionalized polyethylene glycol, poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) functionalized chitosan and {Mo154}. The gelation occurs within 60&#160;s at room temperature, and the dual crosslinking by Schiff base and electrostatic interactions generates a dynamic network, which enables self&#8208;healing after injection. Moreover, the hydrogel delivers chemotherapeutic drugs, with a release triggered by dual near infra&#8208;red (NIR) radiation and pH changes. This stimuli&#8208;responsive release system along with the photothermal conversion ability of the hydrogel allows the simultaneous combination of photothermal and chemotherapy. This synergic system efficiently ablates the cancer tumor in vivo with no systemic toxicity. Overall, this work paves the way for the development of novel {Mo154}&#8208;based systems, incorporated in self&#8208;healing and injectable hydrogels for dual chemo&#8208;photothermal therapy.

         <title>Antibacterial Gel Coatings Inspired by the Cryptic Function of a Mussel Byssal Peptide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In addition to its role in wet adhesion, it is discovered that a peptide (Mfp&#8208;529&#8208;47) derived from the foot pad of mussels exhibits cryptic antibacterial activity. This discovery inspires the design of antibacterial adhesive hydrogels that kill bacteria by two mechanisms: surface&#8208;contact membrane disruption and oxidative killing. The lead material, MIKA2, inhibits bacterial colonization on titanium implants in mice.








Abstract
Although the adhesive and cohesive nature of mussel byssal proteins have long served to inspire the design of materials embodying these properties, their characteristic amino acid compositions suggest that they might also serve to inspire an unrelated material function not yet associated with this class of protein. Herein, it is demonstrated that a peptide derived from mussel foot protein&#8208;5, a key protein in mussel adhesion, displays antibacterial properties, a yet unreported activity. This cryptic function serves as inspiration for the design of a new class of peptide&#8208;based antibacterial adhesive hydrogels prepared via self&#8208;assembly, which are active against drug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. The gels exert two mechanisms of action, surface&#8208;contact membrane disruption and oxidative killing affected by material&#8208;produced H2O2. Detailed studies relating amino acid composition and sequence to material mechanical adhesion/cohesion and antibacterial activity affords the MIKA2 adhesive gel, a material with a superior activity that is shown to inhibit colonization of titanium implants in mice.

         <title>Monte Carlo Simulations Reveal New Design Principles for Efficient Nanoradiosensitizers Based on Nanoscale Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation study reveals nanoscale metal&#8211;organic frameworks (nMOFs) as superior radiosensitizers over non&#8208;porous nanoparticles. The porous lattice model shows improved radiosensitization regardless of radiation source and lattice size. An optimal dose enhancement can be achieved by tuning the geometry of the lattice, providing the theoretical basis for the design of nMOFs for radiotherapy.








Abstract
Nanoscale metal&#8211;organic frameworks (nMOFs) have recently been shown to provide better radiosensitization than solid nanoparticles (NPs) when excited with X&#8208;rays. Here, a Monte Carlo simulation of different radiosensitization effects by NPs and nMOFs using a lattice model consisting of 3D arrays of nanoscale secondary building units (SBUs) is reported. The simulation results reveal that lattices outperform solid NPs regardless of radiation sources or particle sizes via enhanced scatterings of photons and electrons within the lattices. Optimum dose enhancement can be achieved by tuning SBU size and inter&#8208;SBU distance.

         <title>Cactus&#8208;Spine&#8208;Inspired Sweat&#8208;Collecting Patch for Fast and Continuous Monitoring of Sweat</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sweat&#8208;collecting patch with high sweat&#8208;collection efficiency is developed. The patch uses cactus&#8208;spine&#8208;inspired wedge&#8208;shaped wettability&#8208;patterned channels, which induce a unidirectional Laplace pressure that transports the sweat to the sensing&#8208;area spontaneously without leaving it inside the channel. A sensor based on the patch responds quickly to biochemicals in sweat and the patch enables the continuous monitoring of biochemical changes in sweat.








Abstract
A sweat sensor is expected to be the most appropriate wearable device for noninvasive healthcare monitoring. However, the practical use of sweat sensors is impeded by irregular and low sweat secretion rates. Here, a sweat&#8208;collecting patch that can collect sweat efficiently for fast and continuous healthcare monitoring is demonstrated. The patch uses cactus&#8208;spine&#8208;inspired wedge&#8208;shaped wettability&#8208;patterned channels on a hierarchical microstructured/nanostructured surface. The channel shape, in combination with the superhydrophobic/superhydrophilic surface materials, induces a unidirectional Laplace pressure that transports the sweat to the sensing area spontaneously even when the patch is aligned vertically. The patch demonstrates superior sweat&#8208;collecting efficiency and reduces the time required to fill the sensing area by transporting sweat almost without leaving it inside the channel. Therefore, a sensor based on the patch responds quickly to biochemicals in sweat, and the patch enables the continuous monitoring of changes in sweat biochemicals according to their changes in the wearer's blood.

         <title>Engineered Extracellular Matrices with Integrated Wireless Microactuators to Study Mechanobiology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in vitro biomimetic platform that provides independent control over geometry, mechanics, and structure over extracellular matrices is introduced. Remote application of forces using robotically controlled magnetic microactuators triggers native mechanobiology responses including intracellular signaling and directed migration. A digital twin complements the platform by reporting stresses generated upon actuation.








Abstract
Mechanobiology explores how forces regulate cell behaviors and what molecular machinery are responsible for the sensing, transduction, and modulation of mechanical cues. To this end, probing of cells cultured on planar substrates has served as a primary experimental setting for many decades. However, native extracellular matrices (ECMs) consist of fibrous protein assemblies where the physical properties spanning from the individual fiber to the network architecture can influence the transmission of forces to and from the cells. Here, a robotic manipulation platform that allows wireless, localized, and programmable deformation of an engineered fibrous ECM is introduced. A finite&#8208;element&#8208;based digital twin of the fiber network calibrated against measured local and global parameters enables the calculation of deformations and stresses generated by different magnetic actuation schemes across a range of network properties. Physiologically relevant mechanical forces are applied to cells cultured on the fiber network, statically or dynamically, revealing insights into the effects of matrix&#8208;borne forces and deformations as well as force&#8208;mediated matrix remodeling on cell migration and intracellular signaling. These capabilities are not matched by any existing approach, and this versatile platform has the potential to uncover fundamental mechanisms of mechanobiology in settings with greater relevance to living tissues.

     alt="Engineered Extracellular Matrices with Integrated Wireless Microactuators to Study Mechanobiology"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An in vitro biomimetic platform that provides independent control over geometry, mechanics, and structure over extracellular matrices is introduced. Remote application of forces using robotically controlled magnetic microactuators triggers native mechanobiology responses including intracellular signaling and directed migration. A digital twin complements the platform by reporting stresses generated upon actuation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mechanobiology explores how forces regulate cell behaviors and what molecular machinery are responsible for the sensing, transduction, and modulation of mechanical cues. To this end, probing of cells cultured on planar substrates has served as a primary experimental setting for many decades. However, native extracellular matrices (ECMs) consist of fibrous protein assemblies where the physical properties spanning from the individual fiber to the network architecture can influence the transmission of forces to and from the cells. Here, a robotic manipulation platform that allows wireless, localized, and programmable deformation of an engineered fibrous ECM is introduced. A finite-element-based digital twin of the fiber network calibrated against measured local and global parameters enables the calculation of deformations and stresses generated by different magnetic actuation schemes across a range of network properties. Physiologically relevant mechanical forces are applied to cells cultured on the fiber network, statically or dynamically, revealing insights into the effects of matrix-borne forces and deformations as well as force-mediated matrix remodeling on cell migration and intracellular signaling. These capabilities are not matched by any existing approach, and this versatile platform has the potential to uncover fundamental mechanisms of mechanobiology in settings with greater relevance to living tissues.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Promoting Energy Transfer via Manipulation of Crystallization Kinetics of Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskites for Efficient Green Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homogeneous distribution of different&#8208;n phases and more efficient energy transfer is realized in quasi&#8208;2D perovskites. The origin is found to be the manipulation of the crystallization kinetics, where the addition of potassium restricts the nucleation of high&#8208;n phases and allows the growth of low&#8208;n phases, resulting in an external quantum efficiency of 18.15%.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D (Q&#8208;2D) perovskites are promising materials applied in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) due to their high exciton binding energy and quantum confinement effects. However, Q&#8208;2D perovskites feature a multiphase structure with abundant grain boundaries and interfaces, leading to nonradiative loss during the energy&#8208;transfer process. Here, a more efficient energy transfer in Q&#8208;2D perovskites is achieved by manipulating the crystallization kinetics of different&#8208;n phases. A series of alkali&#8208;metal bromides is utilized to manipulate the nucleation and growth of Q&#8208;2D perovskites, which is likely associated with the Coulomb interaction between alkali&#8208;metal ions and the negatively charged PbBr64&#8211; frames. The incorporation of K+ is found to restrict the nucleation of high&#8208;n phases and allows the subsequent growth of low&#8208;n phases, contributing to a spatially more homogeneous distribution of different&#8208;n phases and promoted energy transfer. As a result, highly efficient green Q&#8208;2D perovskites LEDs with a champion EQE of 18.15% and a maximum brightness of 25 800&#160;cd m&#8211;2 are achieved. The findings affirm a novel method to optimize the performance of Q&#8208;2D perovskite LEDs.

         <title>An Optogenetics&#8208;Inspired Flexible van der Waals Optoelectronic Synapse and its Application to a Convolutional Neural Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible van der Waals (vdW) optoelectronic synapse fabricated on 2D vdW layered rhenium disulfide, which features an inherent photosensitive memory nature derived from the persistent photoconductivity effect, is proposed. Following in&#8208;depth analysis including density functional theory calculations on rhenium disulfide, its feasibility for hardware neural networks with learning ability is demonstrated using a convolutional neural network composed of vdW optoelectronic synapses.








Abstract
Optogenetics refers to a technique that uses light to modulate neuronal activity with a high spatiotemporal resolution, which enables the manipulation of learning and memory functions in the human brain. This strategy of controlling neuronal activity using light can be applied for the development of intelligent systems, including neuromorphic and in&#8208;memory computing systems. Herein, a flexible van der Waals (vdW) optoelectronic synapse is reported, which is a core component of optogenetics&#8208;inspired intelligent systems. This synapse is fabricated on 2D vdW layered rhenium disulfide (ReS2) that features an inherent photosensitive memory nature derived from the persistent photoconductivity (PPC) effect, successfully mimicking the dynamics of biological synapses. Based on first&#8208;principles calculations, the PPC effect is identified to originate from sulfur vacancies in ReS2 that have an inherent tendency to form shallow defect states near the conduction band edges and under optical excitation lead to large lattice relaxation. Finally, the feasibility of applying the synapses in optogenetics&#8208;inspired intelligent systems is demonstrated via training and inference tasks for the CIFAR&#8208;10 dataset using a convolutional neural network composed of vdW optoelectronic synapse devices.

         <title>Spontaneous Topological Magnetic Transitions in NdCo5 Rare&#8208;Earth Magnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spontaneous magnetic biskyrmion lattices and the successive transformation into enclosed in&#8208;plane domains over a broad temperature range of 120&#8211;282 K is directly observed by in situ cooling a hexagonal rare&#8208;earth NdCo5 alloy in Lorentz TEM. The ability to manipulate topological magnetization by anisotropy invites application exploration of novel topological magnetic spin textures and physical mechanisms in rare&#8208;earth magnets.








Abstract
Particle&#8208;like magnetic textures with nanometric sizes, such as skyrmions, are potentially suitable for designing high&#8208;efficiency information bits in future spintronics devices. In general, the Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interactions and dipolar interactions are the dominant factors for generating nonlinear spin configurations. However, to stabilize the topological skyrmions, an external magnetic field is usually required. In this study, the spontaneous emergence of skyrmions is directly observed, together with the unique successive topological domain evolution during the spin reorientation transition in a neodymium&#8211;cobalt (NdCo5) rare&#8208;earth magnet. On decreasing the temperature, nanometric skyrmion lattices evolve into enclosed in&#8208;plane domains (EIPDs) similar to mini bar&#8208;magnets with size below 120&#160;nm. The internal magnetization rotates with magnetic anisotropy, demonstrating the ability to manipulate the mini bar&#8208;magnets. The nanoscale EIPD lattices remain robust over the wide temperature range of 241&#8211;167 K, indicating the possibility of high&#8208;density in&#8208;plane magnetic information storage. The generation of spontaneous magnetic skyrmions and the successive domain transformation in the traditional NdCo5 rare&#8208;earth magnet may prompt application exploration for topological magnetic spin textures with novel physical mechanisms in versatile magnets.

         <title>Self&#8208;Induced Type&#8208;I Band Alignment at Surface Grain Boundaries for Highly Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultralow surface temperature on perovskite films is constructed, then surface perovskite lattice is etched by the condensed moisture. Therefore, PbI2 is produced and type&#8208;I band alignment at the upper surface grain boundaries is formed, which significantly reduces the interface loss of carriers and improves the efficiency of perovskite solar cells to 23.2%.








Abstract
The open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is reported to be significantly weakened by carrier loss at the film surface. Here, the moisture condensation at only the upper surface of perovskite films is controlled by constructing an ultralow surface temperature. Then, type&#8208;I band alignment can be formed at the surface grain boundaries due to the etching effect of trace amounts of condensed moisture. The beneficially constructed surface type&#8208;I band alignment can effectively repel carriers and return them to the inside of the grain, significantly avoiding the carrier loss at films surface. As a result, a superior carrier lifetime exceeding 2.5&#160;&#181;s is obtained and the VOC of PSC is remarkably boosted from 1.07 to 1.17&#160;V. The minimum VOC deficit of only 0.39&#160;V enables a substantial gain in power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 20.2% to 22.4% in one&#8208;step spin&#8208;coating methods. Moreover, this innovation is versatile and a champion PCE of 23.2% is also achieved in two&#8208;step spin&#8208;coating methods.

         <title>Reversible Dendritic&#8208;Crystal&#8208;Reinforced Polymer Gel for Bioinspired Adaptable Adhesive</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystal&#8208;fiber&#8208;reinforced polymer gel adhesive is prepared by introducing room&#8208;temperature crystallizable solvent into the polymer network, realizing ultrastrong adhesion strength and universal interface adaptability. The adhesive ensures the high adhesion strength to the hard interface and excellent peeling toughness to soft biological tissues and can be adjusted via external stimuli, which achieves superior detachability and recycling performance.








Abstract
High&#8208;strength and reversible adhesion technology, which is a universal phenomenon in nature but remains challenging for artificial synthesis, is essential for the development of modern science. Existing adhesive designs without interface versatility hinder their application to arbitrary surfaces. Bioinspired by creeper suckers, a crystal&#8208;fiber reinforced polymer gel adhesive with ultrastrong adhesion strength and universal interface adaptability is creatively prepared via introducing a room&#8208;temperature crystallizable solvent into the polymer network. The gel adhesive formed by hydrogen bonding interaction between crystal fibers and polymer network can successfully realize over 9.82&#160;MPa reversible adhesion strength for rough interface and 406.87 J m&#8722;2 peeling toughness for skin tissue. In situ anchoring is achieved for adapting to different geometrical surfaces. The adhesion performance can be significantly improved with the further increase of the interfacial roughness and hydrophilicity, whose dissipation mechanism is simulated by finite element analysis. The melting&#8211;crystallization equilibrium of the crystal fibers is proved by synchrotron radiation scattering. Accordingly, reversible phase&#8208;transition triggered by light and heat can realize the controlled adhere&#8211;detach recycle. Later adjustments to the monomers or crystals are expected to broaden its applications to various fields such as bioelectronics, electronic processing, and machine handling.

         <title>A Micrometer&#8208;Sized Silicon/Carbon Composite Anode Synthesized by Impregnation of Petroleum Pitch in Nanoporous Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A micrometer&#8208;sized silicon/carbon composite anode developed by facile and scalable impregnation of petroleum pitch that stabilizes nanoporous Si against sintering at high temperature is reported. The composite anode including single nanometer&#8208;sized primary particles shielded by pitch&#8208;derived carbon exhibits outstanding battery performance such as 80% capacity retention after 450 cycles in the full cell system.








Abstract
Porous silicon (Si)/carbon nanocomposites have been extensively explored as a promising anode material for high&#8208;energy lithium (Li)&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, shrinking of the pores and sintering of Si in the nanoporous structure during fabrication often diminishes the full benefits of nanoporous Si. Herein, a scalable method is reported to preserve the porous Si nanostructure by impregnating petroleum pitch inside of porous Si before high&#8208;temperature treatment. The resulting micrometer&#8208;sized Si/C composite maintains a desired porosity to accommodate large volume change and high conductivity to facilitate charge transfer. It also forms a stable surface coating that limits the penetration of electrolyte into nanoporous Si and minimizes the side reaction between electrolyte and Si during cycling and storage. A Si&#8208;based anode with 80% of pitch&#8208;derived carbon/nanoporous Si enables very stable cycling of a Si||Li(Ni0.5Co0.2Mn0.3)O2 (NMC532) battery (80% capacity retention after 450 cycles). It also leads to low swelling in both particle and electrode levels required for the next generation of high&#8208;energy LIBs. The process also can be used to preserve the porous structure of other nanoporous materials that need to be treated at high temperatures.

         <title>Lithiation&#8208;Enabled High&#8208;Density Nitrogen Vacancies Electrocatalyze CO2 to C2 Products</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical CO2 reduction to produce C2 products is attractive but is still challenged by low activity and poor selectivity. A Cu3Nx catalyst with abundant nitrogen vacancies induced by lithiation/delithiation presents a much&#8208;improved Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;82% for C2 products due to the lower energy barriers of the key C2 pathway intermediates.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction to produce valuable C2 products is attractive but still suffers with relatively poor selectivity and stability at high current densities, mainly due to the low efficiency in the coupling of two *CO intermediates. Herein, it is demonstrated that high&#8208;density nitrogen vacancies formed on cubic copper nitrite (Cu3Nx) feature as efficient electrocatalytic centers for CO&#8211;CO coupling to form the key OCCO* intermediate toward C2 products. Cu3Nx with different nitrogen densities are fabricated by an electrochemical lithium tuning strategy, and density functional theory calculations indicate that the adsorption energies of CO* and the energy barriers of forming key C2 intermediates are strongly correlated with nitrogen vacancy density. The Cu3Nx catalyst with abundant nitrogen vacancies presents one of the highest Faradaic efficiencies toward C2 products of 81.7&#160;&#177; 2.3% at &#8722;1.15&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (without ohmic correction), corresponding to the partial current density for C2 production as &#8722;307&#160;&#177; 9 mA cm&#8722;2. An outstanding electrochemical stability is also demonstrated at high current densities, substantially exceeding CuOx catalysts with oxygen vacancies. The work suggests an attractive approach to create stable anion vacancies as catalytic centers toward multicarbon products in electrochemical CO2 reduction.

         <title>Truth and Myth of Phase Coexistence in Methylammonium Lead Iodide Perovskite Thin Film via Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites have attracted substantial interest as the most favorable prospective material for efficient photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices. However, their extreme sensitivity to electron beam radiation makes it difficult to obtain their intrinsic structure by transmission electron microscopy and can even lead to significant misidentifications. In 2018, the coexistence of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) in the cubic and tetragonal phase using electron microscopy and electron diffraction techniques was reported in article &#8220;Self&#8208;Organized Superlattice and Phase Coexistence inside Thin Film Organometal Halide Perovskite&#8221;. Herein, however, that claim is challenged by comparing their experimental data to simulated diffraction patterns and arguing that their perovskite samples may have been damaged due to excessive electron beam irradiation. Consequently, true phase coexistence was not observed in that previously reported work, rather merely the decomposition products of MAPbI3.

Abstract
In response to the Comment on article &#8220;Self&#8208;Organized Superlattice and Phase Coexistence inside Thin Film Organometal Halide Perovskite&#8221;, it is suggested that the facts that the existence of hexagonal PbI2 is discrepant in 3D crystallographic interpretation and that observation of (01&#175;0) and (100) reflections occurs in general, together make the challenges that were raised in the published Comment less convincing. In addition, a new transmission electron microscopy method using direction&#8208;selective electron beam damage of the organometal halide perovskite is disclosed.

Photothermal Materials
In article number 2007761, Shiqi Wang, H&#233;lder Santos, and co&#8208;workers introduce a polyoxometalate {Mo154}&#8208;incorporating, dual&#8208;crosslinked dynamic hydrogel (Mo154Gel) formed by Schiff base and electrostatic interactions. Mo154Gel shows exceptional photothermal conversion, and pH&#8208; and near&#8208;infrared&#8208;laser&#8208;triggered drug release. This work paves the way for the development of novel {Mo154}&#8208;based platforms incorporated in self&#8208;healing and injectable hydrogels for combinatorial chemo&#8208;photothermal cancer therapy.

Cancer Therapy
A two&#8208;edged&#8208;sword strategy for anticancer and chondroprotective treatment is approached by combining two key players, as reported by Mi&#8208;Lan Kang, Hak&#8208;Joon Sung, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2101558. Cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;derived nanoparticles (CMNPs) induce hypoxic cell&#8211;cell packing seen commonly in cancer growth and chondrogenesis. Notch&#8208;1 suppressor display on CMNPs inhibits angiogenesis efficiently, thereby promoting anticancer growth and prochondrogenesis simultaneously. This study suggests an unprecedented therapeutic strategy for laryngeal cancer which damages cartilage progressively.

Tendon Repair
Piezoelectricity is present in all living beings and provides the basis for mechanisms of tissue regeneration. In article number 2008788, Marc A. Fernandez&#8208;Yague, Manus J. Biggs, and co&#8208;workers show that tendon cell function can be controlled by electrical stimulation and introduce a new implantable stimulator device powered by body movement paving the way for a new class of regenerative electrical therapies without the use of drugs or external stimulation.

Optoelectronic Synapses
In article number 2102980, a flexible optoelectronic synapse fabricated on 2D van der Waals (vdW) layered rhenium disulfide, which features an inherent photosensitive memory nature derived from the persistent photoconductivity effect, is presented by Yong&#8208;Hoon Kim, Jin&#8208;Hong Park, and co&#8208;workers. After in&#8208;depth analysis including density functional theory calculations on rhenium disulfide, its feasibility for a hardware neural network with learning ability is also demonstrated using a convolutional neural network composed of vdW optoelectronic synapses.

The wedge&#8208;shaped wettability patterns of the patch are inspired by spines of cacti; the channel shape, in combination with the superhydrophobic/superhydrophilic surface materials, induces a unidirectional Laplace pressure that transports the sweat to the sensing&#8208;area fast and spontaneously.

Collodial Gradient Materials
Colloidal gradient materials introduce local variation of the physical properties to well&#8208;established colloidal crystals. In article number 2101948, Markus Retsch and co&#8208;workers describe a method to fabricate such colloidal gradient materials. Using such structures as time&#8211;temperature integrating sensors is just one application that showcases the potential of this materials class.

         <title>Polymorphic Phases of Metal Chlorides in the Confined 2D Space of Bilayer Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Unprecedented two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal chloride structures were grown between sheets of bilayer graphene through intercalation of metal and chlorine atoms. Numerous spatially confined 2D phases of AlCl3 and CuCl2 distinct from their typical bulk forms were found, and the transformations between these new phases under the electron beam were directly observed by in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Our density functional theory calculations confirmed the metastability of the atomic structures derived from the STEM experiments and provided insights into the electronic properties of the phases, which range from insulators to semimetals. Additionally, the co&#8208;intercalation of different metal chlorides was found to create completely new hybrid systems; in&#8208;plane quasi&#8208;1D AlCl3/CuCl2 heterostructures were obtained. The existence of polymorphic phases hints at the unique possibilities for fabricating new types of 2D materials with diverse electronic properties confined between graphene sheets.

         <title>Gradient H&#8208;bonding Binder Enables Stable High&#8208;Areal&#8208;Capacity Si&#8208;Based Anodes in Pouch Cells</title>

Abstract
Alleviating large stress is critical for high&#8208;energy batteries with large volume change upon cycling, yet this still presents a challenge. Here, we report a gradient hydrogen&#8208;bonding binder for high&#8208;capacity silicon&#8208;based anodes that are highly desirable for the next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The well&#8208;defined gradient hydrogen bonds, with a successive bond energy of &#8211;2.88 &#8764; &#8211;10.04&#160;kcal mol&#8211;1, can effectively release the large stress of silicon via the sequential bonding cleavage. This can avoid recurrently abrupt structure fracture of traditional binder due to lack of gradient energy dissipation. Certainly, this regulated binder endows stable high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity silicon&#8208;based electrodes &gt;3&#160;mAh cm&#8211;2. Beyond proof of concept, this work demonstrates a 2 Ah silicon&#8208;based pouch cell with an impressive capacity retention of 80.2% after 700 cycles (0.028% decay/cycle) based on this gradient hydrogen&#8208;bonding binder, making it more promising for practical application.

         <title>Digital Light Processing&#8208;based Bioprinting with Composable Gradients</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recapitulation of complex tissues signifies a remarkable challenge and, to date, only few approaches have emerged that can efficiently reconstruct necessary gradients in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) constructs. This is true even though mimicry of these gradients is of great importance to establish the functionality of engineered tissues and devices. Here, a composable&#8208;gradient digital light processing (DLP)&#8208;based (bio)printing system is developed for the first time, utilizing the unprecedented integration of a microfluidic mixer for the generation of either continual or discrete gradients of desired (bio)inks in real time. Notably, the precisely controlled gradients are composable on&#8208;the&#8208;fly by facilely adjusting the (bio)ink flow ratios. In addition, this setup is designed in such a way that no washing steps are needed when exchanging the gradient (bio)inks, further enhancing our time&#8208; and (bio)ink&#8208;saving strategy. Various planar and 3D structures exhibiting continual gradients of materials, of cell densities, of growth factor concentrations, of hydrogel stiffness, and of porosities in horizontal and/or vertical direction, are exemplified. The composable fabrication of multifunctional gradients strongly support the potential of our unique bioprinting system in numerous biomedical applications.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Perovskite Field&#8208;Effect Transistor Artificial Synapses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal halide perovskites are distinctive semiconductors that exhibit both ionic and electronic transport and are promising for artificial synapses. However, developing a 3&#8208;terminal transistor artificial synapse with the perovskite channel remains elusive due to the lack of a proper technique to regulate mobile ions in a non&#8208;volatile manner. Here, we report solution&#8208;processed perovskite transistor for artificial synapses through the implementation of a ferroelectric gate. The ferroelectric polarisation provides a non&#8208;volatile electric field on the perovskite, leading to fixation of the mobile ions and hence modulation of the electronic conductance of the channel. Multi&#8208;state channel conductance is realized by partial ferroelectric polarisation. The ferroelectric&#8208;gated perovskite transistor is successfully used as an artificial synapse that emulates basic synaptic functions such as long&#8208;term plasticity with excellent linearity, short&#8208;term as well as spike&#8208;timing&#8208;dependent plasticity. Our strategy to regulate ion dynamics in the perovskites using the ferroelectric gate suggests a generic route to employ perovskites for synaptic electronics.

         <title>Facet&#8208;dependent Surface Charge and Hydration of Semiconducting Nanoparticles at Variable pH</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Understanding structure and function of solid&#8208;liquid interfaces is essential for the development of nanomaterials for various applications including heterogeneous catalysis in liquid phase processes and water splitting for storage of renewable electricity. The characteristic anisotropy of crystalline nanoparticles is believed to be essential for their performance but remains poorly understood and difficult to characterize. We use dual scale Atomic Force Microscopy to measure electrostatic and hydration forces of faceted semiconducting SrTiO3 nanoparticles in aqueous electrolyte at variable pH. We demonstrate (i) the ability to quantify strongly facet&#8208;dependent surface charges yielding isoelectric points of the dominant {100} and {110} facets that differ by as much as 2&#160;pH units, ii) facet&#8208;dependent accumulation of oppositely charged (SiO2) particles, and iii) that atomic scale defects can be resolved but are in fact rare for the samples investigated. Atomically resolved images and facet&#8208;dependent oscillatory hydration forces suggest a microscopic charge generation mechanism that explains colloidal scale electrostatic forces.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding structure and function of solid-liquid interfaces is essential for the development of nanomaterials for various applications including heterogeneous catalysis in liquid phase processes and water splitting for storage of renewable electricity. The characteristic anisotropy of crystalline nanoparticles is believed to be essential for their performance but remains poorly understood and difficult to characterize. We use dual scale Atomic Force Microscopy to measure electrostatic and hydration forces of faceted semiconducting SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles in aqueous electrolyte at variable pH. We demonstrate (i) the ability to quantify strongly facet-dependent surface charges yielding isoelectric points of the dominant {100} and {110} facets that differ by as much as 2&#160;pH units, ii) facet-dependent accumulation of oppositely charged (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) particles, and iii) that atomic scale defects can be resolved but are in fact rare for the samples investigated. Atomically resolved images and facet-dependent oscillatory hydration forces suggest a microscopic charge generation mechanism that explains colloidal scale electrostatic forces.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Revamping Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries for High Cell&#8208;Level Energy Density by Synergistic Utilization of Polysulfide Additives and Artificial Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase Layers</title>

         <dc:description>
A practical approach for achieving a high &#8220;cell&#8208;level&#8221; energy density using lithium polysulfides (LPS) containing electrolytes and Li2S&#8208;phobic artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (A&#8208;SEI) layers is presented. The synergistic effects from the LPS and A&#8208;SEI result in superior cell&#8208;level volumetric energy densities (&#8776;650&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8722;1) and large cumulative energy densities considering cycling life. 








Abstract
Despite the high theoretical capacity of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, a high cell&#8208;level energy density and a long cycling life are barely achieved, mainly due to the large electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;sulfur ratio, polysulfide (PS) shuttle causing the loss of active sulfur, and the formation of passivation layers on the Li anode. To raise the energy density, holding PS in the cathode has been the most popular approach. Still, it has failed, particularly, when the sulfur loading is high enough to have energy densities similar to those of commercial Li&#8208;ion batteries. Here, a practical approach of achieving high &#8220;cell&#8208;level&#8221; energy densities is attempted using lithium PS (LPS)&#8208;containing electrolytes instead of a pure electrolyte, reducing the electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;sulfur ratio and PS diffusion out of the cathode due to concentration differences. Meanwhile, the persistent problems including PS passivation and Li dendrites are suppressed using Li2S&#8208;phobic artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (A&#8208;SEI) layers on Li metal. The synergistic effects from the LPS additives and A&#8208;SEI result in a superior cell&#8208;level volumetric energy density of 650&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8722;1 as well as large cumulative energy densities considering cycling life. This approach provides an important stepping stone to realize commercial Li&#8211;S batteries rivaling the current Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Lead&#8208;Dominated Hyperfine Interaction Impacting the Carrier Spin Dynamics in Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
The outstanding optical quality of lead halide perovskites inspires studies of their potential for the optical control of carrier spins as pursued in other materials. Entering largely uncharted territory, time&#8208;resolved pump&#8208;probe Kerr rotation is used to explore the coherent spin dynamics of electrons and holes in bulk FA0.9Cs0.1PbI2.8Br0.2 and to determine key parameters characterizing their spins interactions, such as the g&#8208;factors and relaxation times. The demonstrated long spin dynamics and narrow g&#8208;factor distribution prove the perovskites as promising competitors for conventional semiconductors in spintronics. The dynamic nuclear polarization via spin&#8208;oriented holes is realized and the identification of the 207Pb isotope in optically&#8208;detected nuclear magnetic resonance proves that the hole&#8208;nuclei interaction is dominated by the lead ions. A detailed theoretical analysis accounting for the specifics of the lead halide perovskite materials allows the evaluation of the underlying hyperfine interaction constants, both for electrons and holes. Recombination and spin dynamics evidence that at low temperatures photogenerated electrons and holes are localized at different regions of the perovskite crystal, resulting in their long lifetimes up to 44&#160;&#956;s. Our&#160;findings form the base for the tailored development of spin&#8208;optoelectronic applications for the large family of lead halide perovskites and their&#160;nanostructures.

         <title>Training the Polarization in Integrated La0.15Bi0.85FeO3&#8208;Based Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
The functionalities of BiFeO3&#8208;based magnetoelectric multiferroic heterostructures rely on the controlled manipulation of its ferroelectric domains and of the corresponding net in&#8208;plane polarization, as this aspect guides the voltage&#8208;controlled magnetic switching. Chemical substitution has emerged as a key to push the energy dissipation of the BiFeO3 into the attojoule range but appears to result in a disordered domain configuration. Using non&#8208;invasive optical second&#8208;harmonic generation on heavily La&#8208;substituted BiFeO3 films, we show that a weak net in&#8208;plane polarization remains imprinted in the pristine films despite the apparent domain disorder. We find that this ingrained net in&#8208;plane polarization can be trained with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane electric fields compatible with applications. Operando studies on capacitor heterostructures treated in this way show the full restoration of the domain configuration of pristine BiFeO3 along with a giant net in&#8208;plane polarization enhancement. Thus, our experiments reveal a surprising robustness of the net in&#8208;plane polarization of BiFeO3 against chemical modification, an important criterion in ongoing attempts to integrate magnetoelectric materials into energy&#8208;efficient devices.

         <title>3D Printing Scaffold Vaccine for Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cancer vaccine platform has attracted great interest in the field of cancer immunotherapy. Here, we developed a 3D printed scaffolds loaded with immunoregulators for enhanced cancer immunotherapy. The rapid manufacturing and precise molding based on 3D printing can realize the mass manufacturing of cancer vaccines and personalized design. Meanwhile, compared to the traditional hydrogel, the 3D&#8208;scaffold with porous structure endowed it similar functions compared with real lymphoid organs by recruitment of a great number of immune cells, leading to the formation of &#8220;artificial tertiary lymphoid structures (aTLS)&#8221;, where is a promising site to enhance both humoral and cellular immune responses. Efficient anticancer immunity is induced when combined with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) to inhibit the tumor growth. We further demonstrate personalized anti&#8208;tumor scaffold vaccines for filling of tumor site after surgery to prevent cancer metastasis. Taken together, these results promise the 3D printing scaffold vaccine as the potential strategy for cancer vaccine therapy in the future.

         <title>Acoustophoretic Liquefaction For 3D Printing Ultrahigh Viscosity Nanoparticle Suspensions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acoustic liquefaction approach to enhance the flow of yield stress fluids during digital light processing (DLP) based 3D printing is reported. This enhanced flow enables processing of ultrahigh viscosity resins (&#956;app &gt;&#160;3700 Pa&#183;s at shear rates &#947; = 0.01 s&#8211;1) based on silica particles in a silicone photopolymer. Numerical simulations of the acousto&#8208;mechanical coupling in the DLP resin feed system at different agitation frequencies predicts local resin flow velocities exceeding 100 mm&#183;s&#8211;1 at acoustic transduction frequencies of 110 s&#8211;1. Under these conditions, highly loaded particle suspensions (weight fractions, f = 0.23) can be printed successfully in complex geometries. Such mechanically reinforced composites possess a tensile toughness 2000% greater than the neat photopolymer. Beyond an increase in processible viscosities, acoustophoretic liquefaction DLP (AL&#8208;DLP) creates a transient reduction in apparent viscosity that promotes resin recirculation and decreases viscous adhesion. As a result, AL&#8208;DLP improves the printed feature resolution by more than 25%, increases printable object sizes by over 50 times, and can build parts &gt;&#160;3 &#215; faster when compared to conventional methodologies.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Thermal Switching of Individual Plasmonically Activated Spin Crossover Nanoparticle Imaged by Ultrafast Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin Crossover (SCO) is a promising switching phenomenon when implemented in electronic devices as molecules, thin films or nanoparticles. Among the properties modulated along this phenomenon, optically induced mechanical changes are of tremendous importance as they can work as fast light&#8208;induced mechanical switches or allow to investigate and control microstructural strains and fatigability. The development of characterization techniques probing nanoscopic behaviour with high spatio&#8208;temporal resolution allows to trigger and visualize such mechanical changes of individual nanoscopic objects. Here we use Ultrafast Transmission Electron Microscopy (UTEM) to precisely probe the length changes of individual switchable nanoparticles induced thermally by nanosecond laser pulses. This allows us to reveal the mechanisms of spin switching, leading to the macroscopic expansion of SCO materials. This study was conducted on individual pure SCO nanoparticles and SCO nanoparticles encapsulating gold nanorods that serve for plasmonic heating under laser pulses. Length changes are compared with time&#8208;resolved optical measurements performed on an assembly of these particles.

         <title>Self&#8208;catalytic Small Interfering RNA Nanocarriers for Synergistic Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gene therapy has shown great potential for neurodegenerative diseases with complex pathology. However, its therapeutic effect is limited due to the delivery barriers and its own single function. Herein, self&#8208;catalytic small interfering RNA (siRNA) nanocarriers (S/Ce&#8208;PABMS) are developed to catalyze delivery process and treatment process for synergistic treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. On the one hand, the rough surface of S/Ce&#8208;PABMS mediated by ceria (CeO2) nanozymes can catalyze cellular uptake in the delivery process, so that S/Ce&#8208;PABMS with acetylcholine analogs penetrate the blood&#8208;brain barrier and enter neurons more effectively. On the other hand, CeO2 nanozymes can catalyze the treatment process by scavenging excess reactive oxygen species, and cooperate with siRNA targeting SNCA to decrease the &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;syn) aggregation and alleviate the parkinsonian pathology. Moreover, the S/Ce&#8208;PABMS treatment reduces the number of activated microglia and regulates the release of inflammatory cytokine, thereby relieving neuroinflammation. After treatment with S/Ce&#8208;PABMS, dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease model mice has been significantly alleviated. The finding shows that the self&#8208;catalytic nanocarriers S/Ce&#8208;PABMS have great potential in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Coupling Spin Defects in a Layered Material to Nanoscale Plasmonic Cavities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride, and specifically the negatively charged boron vacancy (VB&#8211;) centres, are emerging candidates for quantum sensing. However, the VB&#8211; defects suffer from low quantum efficiency and as a result exhibit weak photoluminescence. In this work, we demonstrate a scalable approach to dramatically enhance the VB&#8211; emission by coupling to a plasmonic gap cavity. The plasmonic cavity is composed of a flat gold surface and a silver cube, with few&#8208;layer hBN flakes positioned in between. Employing these plasmonic cavities, we extracted two orders of magnitude in photoluminescence enhancement associated with a corresponding 2&#8208;fold enhancement in optically detected magnetic resonance contrast. The work will be pivotal to progress in quantum sensing employing 2D materials, and realisation of nanophotonic devices with spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride.

         <title>Low&#8208;bandgap Organic Bulk&#8208;heterojunction Enabled Efficient and Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead halide perovskite and organic solar cells (PSCs and OSCs) are considered as the prime candidates currently for clean energy applications due to their solution and low&#8208;temperature processibility. Nevertheless, the substantial photon loss in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region and relatively large photovoltage deficit need to be improved to enable their uses in high&#8208;performance solar cells. To mitigate these disadvantages, we integrate low&#8208;bandgap organic bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) layer into inverted PSCs to construct facile hybrid solar cells (HSCs). By optimizing the BHJ components, we achieve an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.80%, with a decent open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.146&#160;V and extended photo&#8208;response over 950&#160;nm for rigid HSCs. The resultant devices also exhibit superior long&#8208;term (over 1000 h) ambient&#8208; and photo&#8208;stability compared to those from single&#8208;component PSCs and OSCs. More importantly, a champion PCE of 21.73% and excellent mechanical durability can also be achieved in flexible HSCs, which is the highest efficiency reported for flexible solar cells to date. Taking advantage of these impressive device performance, we have successfully integrated flexible HSCs into a power source for wearable sensors to demonstrate real&#8208;time temperature monitoring.

         <title>Synthesis of Pd3Sn and PdCuSn Nanorods with L12 Phase for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Ethanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystal phase of nanomaterials is one of the key parameters to determine their physicochemical property and performance in various applications. However, it still remains a great challenge to synthesize nanomaterials with different crystal phases while maintaining the same composition, size and morphology. Here, we report a facile, one&#8208;pot, wet&#8208;chemical method to synthesize Pd3Sn nanorods with the comparable size and morphology but different crystal phases, i.e., the ordered intermetallic and disordered alloy with the L12 and face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) phases, respectively. The crystal phase of the as&#8208;synthesized Pd3Sn nanorods is easily tuned by altering the types of tin precursors and solvents. Moreover, our approach can also be used to synthesize ternary PdCuSn nanorods with the L12 crystal phase. When used as electrocatalysts, the L12 Pd3Sn nanorods exhibit superior electrocatalytic performance towards the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) compared to their fcc counterpart. Impressively, compared to the L12 Pd3Sn nanorods, the ternary L12 PdCuSn nanorods exhibit more enhanced electrocatalytic performance towards EOR, yielding a high mass current density up to 6.22 A mgPd&#8211;1, which are superior to the commercial Pd/C catalyst and among the best reported Pd&#8208;based EOR electrocatalysts.

Anionic diffusion strongly impacts the stability of halide perovskite materials, but it is still not well&#8208;understood. Here, we report a quantitative investigation of in&#8208;plane thermally driven anionic inter&#8208;diffusion in a series of novel 2D and quasi&#8208;2D halide perovskites lateral heterostructures. The calculated diffusion coefficients (D) reveal the inhibition of Br&#8208;I inter&#8208;diffusion with bulky &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic cations compared with short&#8208;chain aliphatic organic cations. Furthermore, halide diffusion was found to be faster in quasi&#8208;2D (n &gt;&#160;1) than 2D perovskites (n = 1). The increment becomes less apparent as the &#8220;n&#8221; number increases, akin to the quantum confinement effect observed for band gaps. These trends are rationalized by molecular dynamics simulations of free energy barriers for halide diffusion that reveal mechanisms for suppressing diffusion. This work provides important fundamental insights on the anionic migration and diffusion process in halide perovskite materials.

&lt;p&gt;Anionic diffusion strongly impacts the stability of halide perovskite materials, but it is still not well-understood. Here, we report a quantitative investigation of in-plane thermally driven anionic inter-diffusion in a series of novel 2D and quasi-2D halide perovskites lateral heterostructures. The calculated diffusion coefficients (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;) reveal the inhibition of Br-I inter-diffusion with bulky &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-conjugated organic cations compared with short-chain aliphatic organic cations.

         <title>Chirality Bias Tissue Homeostasis By Manipulating Immunological Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
The physiological chirality of extracellular environments is substantially affected by pathological diseases. However, how this stereochemical variation drives host immunity remains poorly understood. Here, we report that pathology&#8208;mimetic M&#8208;nanofibrils&#8212;but not physiology&#8208;mimetic P&#8208;nanofibrils&#8212;act as a defense mechanism that helps to restore tissue homeostasis by manipulating immunological response. Quantitative multi&#8208;omics in vivo and in vitro showed that M&#8208;nanofibrils significantly inhibited inflammation and promoted tissue regeneration by upregulating M2 macrophage polarization and downstream immune signaling compared with P&#8208;nanofibrils. Molecular analysis and theoretical simulation demonstrated that M&#8208;chirality displayed higher stereo&#8208;affinity to cellular binding, which induced higher cellular contractile stress and activated mechanosensitive ion channel PIEZOl to conduct Ca2+ influx. In turn, the nuclear transfer of STAT was biased by Ca2+ influx to promote M2 polarization. These findings underscore the structural mechanisms of disease, providing design basis for immunotherapy with bionic functional materials.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Molybdenum Carbide MXenes for Enhanced Selective Detection of Humidity in Air</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) open up novel opportunities in gas sensing with high sensitivity at room temperature. Herein, we have successfully synthesized 2D Mo2CTx flakes with high aspect ratio. We study the chemiresistive effect in a sub&#8208;&#956;m MXene multilayer for different organic vapors and humidity at 101&#8211;104&#160;ppm in dry air. Reasonably, the low&#8208;noise resistance signal allows the detection of H2O down to 10&#160;ppm. Moreover, humidity suppresses the response of Mo2CTx to organic analytes due to the blocking of adsorption active sites. By measuring the impedance of MXene layers as a function of ac frequency in the 10&#8722;2&#8208;106&#160;Hz range, we show that operation principle of the sensor is dominated by resistance change rather than capacitance variations. The sensor transfer function allows us to conclude that the Mo2CTx chemiresistance is mainly originating from electron transport through inter&#8208;flake potential barriers with heights up to 0.2&#160;eV. DFT calculations, elucidating the Mo2C surface interaction with organic analytes and H2O, explain the experimental data as an energy shift of the density of states under the analyte's adsorption which induces increasing electrical resistance.

         <title>Heterointerface Engineering in Electromagnetic Absorbers: New Insights and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electromagnetic (EM) absorbers play an increasingly essential role in electronic information age, even towards coming intelligent life. The remarkable merits of heterointerface engineering and its peculiar EM characteristics inject a fresh and infinite vitality to design high&#8208;efficiency and stimuli&#8208;responsive EM absorbers. However, there still exist huge challenges in understanding and reinforcing these interface effects from the micro and macro perspectives. Herein, the EM response mechanisms of interfacial effects are dissected in depth, and advanced characterization as well as theoretical techniques is highly focused on. Then, the representative optimization strategies are systematically discussed with an emphasis on component selection and structural design. More importantly, the most cutting&#8208;edge smart EM functional devices based on heterointerface engineering are reported as highlights. Finally, current challenges and concrete suggestion are proposed, and future perspectives on this promising field are predicted as well.

         <title>Functionalized Iron&#8722;Nitrogen&#8722;Carbon Electrocatalyst Provides a Reversible Electron Transfer Platform for Efficient Uranium Extraction from Seawater</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uranium extraction from seawater provides an opportunity for sustainable fuel supply to nuclear power plants. Herein, we demonstrate an adsorption&#8722;electrocatalysis strategy for efficient uranium extraction from seawater using a functionalized iron&#8722;nitrogen&#8722;carbon (Fe&#8722;Nx&#8722;C&#8722;R) catalyst, comprising N&#8722;doped carbon capsules supporting FeNx single&#8722;atom sites and surface chelating amidoxime groups (R). The amidoxime groups bring hydrophilicity to the adsorbent and offer surface&#8722;specific binding sites for UO22+ capture. The site&#8722;isolated FeNx centres reduce adsorbed UO22+ to UO2+. Subsequently, through electrochemical reduction of the FeNx sites, unstable U(V) ions are re&#8722;oxidized to U(VI) in the presence of Na+ resulting in the generation of solid Na2O(UO3&#183;H2O)x, which can easily be collected. Fe&#8722;Nx&#8722;C&#8722;R reduced the uranium concentration in seawater from &#8764;3.5 ppb to below 0.5 ppb with a calculated capacity of &#8764;1.2 mg&#183;g&#8722;1 within 24 h. To the best of our knowledge, the developed system is the first to use the adsorption of uranyl ions and electrodeposition of solid Na2O(UO3.H2O)x for the extraction of uranium from seawater. Our important discoveries guide technology development for the efficient extraction of uranium from seawater.

         <title>Ultrafast Digital Fabrication of Designable Architectured Liquid Crystalline Elastomer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
The muscle&#8208;like activities of liquid crystalline elastomers (LCE) offer great potential for designing future soft machines. Their motion complexity, however, relies on inflexible and cumbersome mesogen alignment techniques. Here, a digital photocuring method for ultrafast template&#8208;free fabrication of LCE artificial muscles capable of designable complex motions is reported. Our method utilizes the intrinsic light attenuation in the through&#8208;plane direction to create mesogen alignment for reversible bending action. To turn this simple actuation into complex motions, the principles of muscles are borrowed which realize diverse motions through the cooperative actions of otherwise simple contraction/expansion of individual muscle bundles. Specifically, the spatio&#8208;temporal digital light is utilized to design LCE architectures composed of strategically arranged bending modules. As such, LCE capable of highly designable motions can be fabricated within 25 seconds light curing without employing any physical alignment templates, which offers an attractive option towards designing functionally diverse soft machines.

         <title>Controllable Nonclassical Conductance Switching in Nanoscale Phase&#8208;Separated (PbI2)1&#8208;x(BiI3)x Layered Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered 2D (PbI2)1&#8208;x(BiI3)x materials exhibit a nonlinear dependence in structural and charge transport properties unanticipated from the combination of PbI2 and BiI3. Within (PbI2)1&#8208;x(BiI3)x crystals phase integration yields deceptive structural features, while phase boundary separation leads to new conductance switching behavior observed as large peaks in current during current&#8208;voltage (I&#8208;V) measurements (&#177;100&#160;V). Temperature and time dependent electrical measurements demonstrate the behavior is attributed to ionic transport perpendicular to the layers. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) reveals the structure of (PbI2)1&#8208;x(BiI3)x is a &#8220;brick wall&#8221; consisting of two phases, Pb&#8208;rich and Bi&#8208;rich. These brick&#8208;like features are 10s nm a side and we posit that iodide ion transport at the interfaces of these regions is responsible for the conductance switching action.

         <title>Nano&#8208;Encapsulation and Confined Growth Kinetics of Lithium Crystals in One&#8208;Dimensional Carbon Hosts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Encapsulation of lithium in the confined spaces within individual nanocapsules is intriguing and highly desirable for developing high&#8208;performance Li metal anodes. This work aims for a mechanistic understanding of Li encapsulation and its confined growth kinetics inside one&#8208;dimensional enclosed spaces. To achieve this, we employ amorphous carbon nanotubes as a model host using in situ transmission electron microscopy. The carbon shells have dual roles, providing geometric/mechanical constraints and electron/ion transport channels, which profoundly alter the Li growth patterns. Li growth/dissolution takes place via atom addition/removal at the free surfaces through Li+ diffusion along the shells in the electric field direction, resulting in the formation of unusual Li structures, such as poly&#8208;crystalline nanowires and free&#8208;standing two&#8208;dimensional ultrathin (1&#8208;2&#160;nm) Li membranes. Such confined front&#8208;growth processes are dominated by Li {110} or {200} growing faces, distinct from the root growth of single&#8208;crystal Li dendrites outside the nanotubes. Controlled experiments show that high lithiophilicity and permeability, enabled by sufficient nitrogen/oxygen doping, is critical for the stable encapsulation of lithium inside carbonaceous nanocapsules. First&#8208;principles&#8208;based calculations reveal that N/O doping can reduce the diffusion barrier for Li+ penetration, and facilitate Li filling driven by energy minimization associated with the formation of low&#8208;energy Li/C interfaces.

         <title>Encapsulation of Metallic Zn in Hybrid MXene/Graphene Aerogel as Stable Zn Anode for Foldable Zn&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
The three&#8208;dimensional (3D) host can effectively mitigate the dendritic growth of zinc (Zn) metal anode. However, the increased electrode/electrolyte reaction area using the 3D substrate accelerates the passivation and corrosion at the anode interface, ultimately degrading the electrochemical performance. Here, an oriented freezing process is used to create a flexible MXene/graphene scaffold. Based on the abundant zincophilic traits and micropores in the structure, Zn is densely encapsulated inside the host by the electrodeposition process. During cycling, the composite anode endows an in&#8208;situ solid electrolyte interface with zinc fluoride at the electrode/electrolyte interface due to inherent fluorine terminations in MXene, efficiently inhibiting the dendritic growth. Furthermore, the design of distributing bulk Zn in a 3D microscale manner suppresses hydrogen evolution reactions (3.8&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) and passivation through in/ex&#8208;situ tests. As a result, in a symmetrical cell test, the electrode has a long&#8208;cycling life of over 1000 h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. After continuous single&#8208;folding followed by double folding, a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state foldable cell with the composite anode and LiMn2O4 cathode (60% depth of discharge) maintains high&#8208;capacity retention of over 91%. This research presents a revolutionary encapsulating idea for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries, as well as foldable investigation.

         <title>Ten Years of Progress in the Synthesis and Development of MXenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) are among the largest 2D material families. MXenes&#8217; unique properties, such as their metal&#8208;like electrical conductivity, render them quite useful in a large number of applications including energy storage, optoelectronic, biomedical, communications, and environmental. A brief historical overview of the first 10 years of MXene research and a perspective on their synthesis and future development are provided.








Abstract
Since their discovery in 2011, the number of 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) has steadily increased. Currently more than 40 MXene compositions exist. The ultimate number is far greater and in time they may develop into the largest family of 2D materials known. MXenes&#8217; unique properties, such as their metal&#8208;like electrical conductivity reaching &#8776;20&#160;000 S cm&#8722;1, render them quite useful in a large number of applications, including energy storage, optoelectronic, biomedical, communications, and environmental. The number of MXene papers and patents published has been growing quickly. The first MXene generation is synthesized using selective etching of metal layers from the MAX phases, layered transition metal carbides and carbonitrides using hydrofluoric acid. Since then, multiple synthesis approaches have been developed, including selective etching in a mixture of fluoride salts and various acids, non&#8208;aqueous etchants, halogens, and molten salts, allowing for the synthesis of new MXenes with better control over their surface chemistries. Herein, a brief historical overview of the first 10 years of MXene research and a perspective on their synthesis and future development are provided. The fact that their production is readily scalable in aqueous environments, with high yields bodes well for their commercialization.

         <title>Micropatterns Fabricated by Photodimerization&#8208;Induced Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward yet powerful strategy to fabricate micropatterns on film surfaces is developed by spatially regulating the photodimerization and mass transport of maleimide. This technology integrates the characteristics of top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up methods, providing a versatile basis for applications in microfluidic channels, composite gratings, devices, and functional systems.








Abstract
Pattern technology plays an important role in the generation of microstructures with different functionalities and morphologies. In this report, a straightforward and versatile strategy is presented for spatially regulating the growth of a microstructure on a surface by the photodimerization of maleimide (MI). Upon exposure of ultraviolet (UV) light, photodimerization of MI in a film comprising furan&#8208;grafted polymer and bismaleimide (BMI) produces a chemical gradient, which can drive the diffusion of BMI from the unexposed to the exposed region and from the bottom to the surface, resulting in the growth of micropatterns. Sequential crosslinking induced by the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between MI and furan maintains the stability of pattern shape. Theoretical modeling with reaction&#8208;diffusion equations reveal that as photodimerization moves the system far from thermodynamic equilibrium, the formation of a chemical potential gradient requires the redistribution of matter, resulting in the formation of topographies. Directional molecular motion induced by UV light can generate complex morphology, and produce materials with unique optical functions, such as charming&#8208;ordered gratings. This straightforward method of fabricating micropatterns by photodimerization&#8208;induced diffusion is successfully applied to patterned curved surfaces, microfluidic channels and encapsulation of integrated light emitting diode chips.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Covalent Organic Framework Cathodes for Enhanced Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise molecular manipulation of redox&#8208;active groups in covalent organic framework (COF) units shows that quinone&#8208;functionalized COFs significantly enhance the specific capacity, elevate the discharge potential, and improve the competitiveness of Zn2+ against H+ intercalation through a stronger coordination bond between cations and C&#63742;O/C&#63742;N groups.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are potentially promising electrode materials for electrochemical charge storage applications thanks to their pre&#8208;designable reticular chemistry with atomic precision, allowing precise control of pore size, redox&#8208;active functional moieties, and stable covalent frameworks. However, studies on the mechanistic and practical aspects of their zinc&#8208;ion storage behavior are still limited. In this study, a strategy to enhance the electrochemical performance of COF cathodes in zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) by introducing the quinone group into 1,4,5,8,9,12&#8208;hexaazatriphenylene&#8208;based COFs is reported. Electrochemical characterization demonstrates that the introduction of the quinone groups in the COF significantly pushes up the Zn2+ storage capability against H+ and elevates the average (dis&#8208;)charge potential in aqueous ZIBs. Computational and experimental analysis further reveals the favorable redox&#8208;active sites that host Zn2+/H+ in COF electrodes and the root cause for the enhanced electrochemical performance. This work demonstrates that molecular engineering of the COF structure is an effective approach to achieve practical charge storage performance.

         <title>Synergistic Effects of Eu&#8208;MOF on Perovskite Solar Cells with Improved Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eu&#8208;MOF is introduced to the field of perovskite solar cells. Both Eu ions and organic ligands reduce the defect concentration. More over, due to the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer effect, Eu&#8208;MOF improves the light utilization. Meanwhile, it also turns tensile strain to compressive strain. Finally, the device performance, in efficiency and stability, is increased dramatically due to the synergetic effects.








Abstract
Enhancing device lifetime is one of the essential challenges in perovskite solar cells. The ultrathin Eu&#8208;MOF layer is introduced at the interface between the electron&#8208;transport layer and the perovskite absorber to improve the device stability. Both Eu ions and organic ligands in the MOF can reduce the defect concentration and improve carrier transport. Moreover, due to the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer effect, Eu&#8208;MOF in perovskite films can improve light utilization and reduce the decomposition under ultraviolet light. Meanwhile, Eu&#8208;MOF also turns tensile strain to compressive strain in the perovskite films. As a result, the corresponding devices achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.16%. In addition, the devices retain 96% of their original PCE after 2000 h under the relative humidity of 30% and 91% of their original PCE after 1200 h after continuous 85&#160;&#176;C aging condition in N2.

         <title>Bitter Flavored, Soft Composites for Wearables Designed to Reduce Risks of Choking in Infants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bitter&#8208;flavored formulations in soft encapsulating layers and hydrogel adhesives for skin&#8208;interfaced wireless devices reduce risks of choking with infants. A bitter dopant, denatonium benzoate, integrated into soft silicone elastomers and hydrogels triggers a reflexive response when dissolved in saliva. Demonstrations in a variety of devices for physiological monitoring highlight the compatibility of these unusual composite materials in clinical&#8208;grade wearables.








Abstract
Wireless, skin&#8208;integrated devices for continuous, clinical&#8208;quality monitoring of vital signs have the potential to greatly improve the care of patients in neonatal and pediatric intensive&#8208;care units. These same technologies can also be used in the home, across a broad spectrum of ages, from beginning to end of life. Although miniaturized forms of such devices minimize patient burden and improve compliance, they represent life&#8208;threatening choking hazards for infants. A materials strategy is presented here to address this concern. Specifically, composite materials are introduced as soft encapsulating layers and gentle adhesives that release chemical compounds designed to elicit an intense bitter taste when placed in the mouth. Reflexive reactions to this sensation strongly reduce the potential for ingestion, as a safety feature. The materials systems described involve a non&#8208;toxic bitterant (denatonium benzoate) as a dopant in an elastomeric (poly(dimethylsiloxane)) or hydrogel matrix. Experimental and computational studies of these composite materials and the kinetics of release of the bitterant define the key properties. Incorporation into various wireless skin&#8208;integrated sensors demonstrates their utility in functional systems. This simple strategy offers valuable protective capabilities, with broad practical relevance to the welfare of children monitored with wearable devices.

         <title>A Highly Compressible and Stretchable Carbon Spring for Smart Vibration and Magnetism Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous spring&#8208;like all&#8208;carbon material achieving both elastic compressibility and stretchability at large strain from &#8722;80% to 80% is obtained when a unique long&#8208;range lamellar multi&#8208;arch microstructure is designed. The excellent mechanical performance combined with the intrinsic advantages of carbon makes it a promising platform for making smart vibration and magnetism sensors that can work at extreme temperatures.








Abstract
Porous carbon materials demonstrate extensive applications for their attractive characteristics. Mechanical flexibility is an essential property guaranteeing their durability. After decades of research efforts, compressive brittleness of porous carbon materials is well resolved. However, reversible stretchability remains challenging to achieve due to the intrinsically weak connections and fragile joints of the porous carbon networks. Herein, it is presented that a porous all&#8208;carbon material achieving both elastic compressibility and stretchability at large strain from &#8722;80% to 80% can be obtained when a unique long&#8208;range lamellar multi&#8208;arch microstructure is introduced. Impressively, the porous all&#8208;carbon material can maintain reliable structural robustness and durability under loading condition of cyclic compressing&#8211;stretching process, similar to a real metallic spring. The unique performance renders it as a promising platform for making smart vibration and magnetism sensors, even capable of operating at extreme temperatures. Furthermore, this study provides valuable insights for creating highly stretchable and compressible porous materials from other neat inorganic components for diverse applications in future.

         <title>Hollow InVO4 Nanocuboid Assemblies toward Promoting Photocatalytic N2 Conversion Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The InVO4 superstructure with a cube&#8208;shaped skeleton and hollow interior is synthesized. The closely ordered assembly of nanocuboids improves the separation of electron&#8211;hole pairs through promoted charge transfer among neighboring building blocks. This promising charge mobility feature contributes to the pronounced photocatalytic performance of InVO4 superstrucure toward N2 fixation into NH3.








Abstract
The unique InVO4 mesocrystal superstructure, particularly with cubical skeleton and hollow interior, which consists of numerous nanocube building blocks, closely stacking by stacking, aligning by aligning, and sharing the same crystallographic orientations, is successfully fabricated. The synergy of a reaction&#8208;limited aggregation and an Ostwald ripening process is reasonably proposed for the growth of this unique superstructure. Both single&#8208;particle surface photovoltage and confocal fluorescence spectroscopy measurements demonstrate that the long&#8208;range ordered mesocrystal superstructures can significantly retard the recombination of electron&#8211;hole pairs through the creation of a new pathway for anisotropic electron flow along the inter&#8208;nanocubes. This promising charge mobility feature of the superstructure greatly contributes to the pronounced photocatalytic performance of the InVO4 mesocrystal toward fixation of N2 into NH3 with the quantum yield of 0.50% at wavelength of 385&#160;nm.

&lt;p&gt;The unique InVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; mesocrystal superstructure, particularly with cubical skeleton and hollow interior, which consists of numerous nanocube building blocks, closely stacking by stacking, aligning by aligning, and sharing the same crystallographic orientations, is successfully fabricated. The synergy of a reaction-limited aggregation and an Ostwald ripening process is reasonably proposed for the growth of this unique superstructure. Both single-particle surface photovoltage and confocal fluorescence spectroscopy measurements demonstrate that the long-range ordered mesocrystal superstructures can significantly retard the recombination of electron&#8211;hole pairs through the creation of a new pathway for anisotropic electron flow along the inter-nanocubes. This promising charge mobility feature of the superstructure greatly contributes to the pronounced photocatalytic performance of the InVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; mesocrystal toward fixation of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with the quantum yield of 0.50% at wavelength of 385&#160;nm.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrafast Bubble Bursting by Superamphiphobic Coatings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superamphiphobic surfaces for ultrafast bubble bursting are introduced. Liquid flame spray is fast and scalable, and allows tuning of the nano&#8208; and micrometer&#8208;scale architecture of hierarchical surface structures. Bubbles burst rapidly upon contact and the gas is absorbed into the surface structures. The recorded rates are enhanced by a factor of 3 relative to previously reported results.








Abstract
Controlling bubble motion or passively bursting bubbles using solid interfaces is advantageous in numerous industrial applications including flotation, catalysis, electrochemical processes, and microfluidics. Current research has explored the formation, dissolution, pinning, and rupturing of bubbles on different surfaces. However, the ability to tune and control the rate of bubble bursting is not yet achieved. Scaling down surface&#8208;induced bubble bursting to just a few milliseconds is important for any application. In this work, the hierarchical structure of superamphiphobic surfaces is tuned in order to rapidly rupture contacting bubbles. Surfaces prepared using liquid flame spray show ultrafast bubble bursting (down to 2&#160;ms) and superior durability. The coatings demonstrate excellent mechanical and chemical stability even in the presence of surface&#8208;active species. Air from the ruptured bubble is absorbed into the aerophilic Cassie&#8208;state. Long&#8208;term applicability is demonstrated by preventing the accumulation of air in the plastron via a connection of the plastron to the environment. The times recorded for bubble rupture and complete reorganization of air are reduced by approximately a factor of 3 compared to previously reported values. The concept is utilized to passively control surfactant&#8208;rich foam in froth flotation. Material collection efficiency increased by more than 60&#160;times compared to controls.

         <title>Synaptic Plasticity Powering Long&#8208;Afterglow Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synaptic indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide (IGZO) layer is integrated into a novel organic light&#8208;emitting transistor (OLET) device. The UV&#8208;light&#8208;driven photoinduced synaptic effect is used to power a persistent bright afterglow emission in an organic light&#8208;emitting material. The unique OLETs are integrated in active&#8208;matrix light&#8208;emitting arrays operating as visual UV sensors capable of long&#8208;lifetime green&#8208;light emission in the irradiated regions.








Abstract
Long&#8208;lasting luminescence in optoelectronic devices is highly sought after for applications in optical data storage and display technology. While in light&#8208;emitting diodes this is achieved by exploiting long&#8208;afterglow organic materials as active components, such a strategy has never been pursued in light&#8208;emitting transistors, which are still rather unexplored and whose technological potential is yet to be demonstrated. Herein, the fabrication of long&#8208;afterglow organic light&#8208;emitting transistors (LAOLETs) is reported whose operation relies on an unprecedented strategy based on a photoinduced synaptic effect in an inorganic indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide (IGZO) semiconducting channel layer, to power a persistent electroluminescence in organic light&#8208;emitting materials. Oxygen vacancies in the IGZO layer, produced by irradiation at &#955;&#160;= 312&#160;nm, free electrons in excess yielding to a channel conductance increase. Due to the slow recombination kinetics of photogenerated electrons to oxygen vacancies in the channel layer, the organic material can be fueled by postsynaptic current and displays a long&#8208;lived light&#8208;emission (hundreds of seconds) after ceasing UV irradiation. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the LAOLETs are integrated in active&#8208;matrix light&#8208;emitting arrays operating as visual UV sensors capable of long&#8208;lifetime green&#8208;light emission in the irradiated regions.

         <title>A Zwitterionic Polyurethane Nanoporous Device with Low Foreign&#8208;Body Response for Islet Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zwitterionic nanofibrous islet encapsulation device made of sulfobetaine&#8208;modified polyurethane is reported. The device is mechanically robust, effective in preventing cell entrance or escape, hydrophilic with facile mass transfer, and biocompatible with low levels of fibrotic deposition in mice, dogs, and pigs. These attributes make it an attractive candidate for safe delivery of insulin&#8208;producing cells to treat type 1 diabetes.








Abstract
Encapsulation of insulin&#8208;producing cells is a promising strategy for treatment of type 1 diabetes. However, engineering an encapsulation device that is both safe (i.e., no cell escape and no breakage) and functional (i.e., low foreign&#8208;body response (FBR) and high mass transfer) remains a challenge. Here, a family of zwitterionic polyurethanes (ZPU) with sulfobetaine groups in the polymer backbone is developed, which are fabricated into encapsulation devices with tunable nanoporous structures via electrospinning. The ZPU encapsulation device is hydrophilic and fouling&#8208;resistant, exhibits robust mechanical properties, and prevents cell escape while still allowing efficient mass transfer. The ZPU device also induces a much lower FBR or cellular overgrowth upon intraperitoneal implantation in C57BL/6 mice for up to 6 months compared to devices made of similar polyurethane without the zwitterionic modification. The therapeutic potential of the ZPU device is shown for islet encapsulation and diabetes correction in mice for &#8776;3 months is demonstrated. As a proof of concept, the scalability and retrievability of the ZPU device in pigs and dogs are further demonstrated. Collectively, these attributes make ZPU devices attractive candidates for cell encapsulation therapies.

         <title>High&#8208;Strength and Nonfouling Zwitterionic Triple&#8208;Network Hydrogel in Saline Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective strategy is developed to achieve both high mechanical strength and excellent nonfouling properties in saline environments, important for biomedical and engineering applications, by constructing a pure zwitterionic triple&#8208;network hydrogel. Strong chain entanglement and electrostatic interactions provide effective energy dissipation to improve the mechanical strength and toughness of the hydrogel.








Abstract
Zwitterionic hydrogels have received great attention due to their excellent nonfouling and biocompatible properties, but they suffer from weak mechanical strength in the saline environments important for biomedical and engineering applications due to the &#8220;anti&#8208;polyelectrolyte&#8221; effect. Conventional strategies to introduce hydrophobic or non&#8208;zwitterionic components to increase mechanical strength compromise their nonfouling properties. Here, a highly effective strategy is reported to achieve both high mechanical strength and excellent nonfouling properties by constructing a pure zwitterionic triple&#8208;network (ZTN) hydrogel. The strong electrostatic interaction and network entanglement within the triple&#8208;network structure can effectively dissipate energy to toughen the hydrogel and achieve high strength, toughness, and stiffness in saline environments (compressive fracture stress 18.2 &#177; 1.4&#160;MPa,&#160;toughness 1.62 &#177; 0.03&#160;MJ m&#8211;3,&#160;and modulus 0.66 &#177; 0.03&#160;MPa&#160;in seawater environments). Moreover, the ZTN hydrogel is shown to strongly resist the attachment of proteins, bacteria, and cells. The results provide a fundamental understanding to guide the design of tough nonfouling zwitterionic hydrogels for a broad range of applications.

         <title>Modular Assembly of Tumor&#8208;Penetrating and Oligomeric Nanozyme Based on Intrinsically Self&#8208;Assembling Protein Nanocages</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
It remains challenging to precisely control and reproducibly formulate nanomedicines. A nanomaterial&#8208;based synthetic biology strategy is established for tailoring oligomeric nanostructures and a series of artificial metalloenzymes in a precisely controlled manner, which offers an option for tailored anticancer nanomedicines that have a high degree of control over both geometry and valency.








Abstract
Biomimetic design of nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like characteristics has emerged as a promising method for the generation of novel therapeutics. However, synthesis of nanomaterials while maintaining a high degree of control over both geometry and valency poses a prominent challenge. Herein, the authors introduce a nanomaterial&#8208;based synthetic biology strategy for accurate and quantitative tailoring of high&#8208;ordered nanostructures that uses a &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; hierarchical incorporation of protein building blocks. The assembled nano&#8208;oligomers possessed tunable protein motifs and multivalent binding domains, which facilitated prolonged blood circulation time, accumulation within tumor cells through direct targeting of cell receptors, and deep tumor tissue penetration via a transcytosis mechanism. Using these protein/protein nano&#8208;oligomers as scaffolds, the authors created a new series of artificial nano&#8208;scaled metalloenzymes (nanozymes) by the in situ incorporation of metal nanoclusters within the cavity of the protein nanocages. Nanozymes were&#160;capable of mimicking peroxidase&#8208;like activity and generated cytotoxic free radicals. Compared to nanozyme alone, the systemic delivery of oligomeric nanozymes demonstrated significantly enhanced therapeutic and anti&#8208;tumor benefits. This study shows a new insight into nanotechnology by taking advantage of synthetic biotechnology.

         <title>Hydrophilicity&#8208;Hydrophobicity Transformation, Thermoresponsive Morphomechanics, and Crack Multifurcation Revealed by AIEgens in Mechanically Strong Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct visualization of microphase separation and easy differentiation of hydrophilicity&#8211;hydrophobicity transformation is achieved in a facile, high&#8208;contrast, and noninvasive manner by using luminogens with aggregation&#8208;induced emission as fluorescent indicators. Based on the morphological observation and mechanical study, the concept of morphomechanics with a comprehensive mechanism clarification is proposed.








Abstract
Biomimetic exploration of stimuli&#8208;responsive and crack&#8208;resistant hydrogels is of great academic and practical significance, although the rational design of tough hydrogels is limited by insufficient mechanism study due to the lack of imaging techniques to &#8220;see&#8221; hydrogels at mesoscale level. A series of composite hydrogels with compartmentalized thermal response is designed by incorporating aggregation&#8208; and polarity&#8208;sensitive fluorescent probes in a poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) network grafted with poly(N,N&#8208;dimethylacrylamide) side&#8208;chains. The fluorescence technique is explored as a powerful tool to directly visualize their hydrophilicity&#8208;hydrophobicity transformation and the composition&#8208;dependent microphase separation. Based on the morphological observation and mechanical measurements, the concept of morphomechanics with a comprehensive mechanism clarification is proposed. In this regard, the thermoresponsive toughening is attributed to the formation of multiple noncovalent interactions and the conformational changes of PNIPAM chains. The enhanced fracture energy by crack multifurcation is related to the tearing&#8208;like disruption of weak interfaces between the separated phases.

         <title>Metavalent Bonding in Crystalline Solids: How Does It Collapse?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metavalent bonding in solids is shown to differ significantly from covalent bonding, as demonstrated by pronounced property changes for optical, vibrational, electronic, and structural properties upon the transition from covalent to metavalent bonding. This insight and the resulting map showing trends in chemical bonding and material properties can be used to design and tailor materials.








Abstract
The chemical bond is one of the most powerful, yet much debated concepts in chemistry, explaining property trends in solids. Recently, a novel type of chemical bonding was&#160;identified in several higher chalcogenides, characterized by a unique property portfolio, unconventional bond breaking, and sharing of about one electron between adjacent atoms. This metavalent bond is a fundamental type of bonding in solids, besides covalent, ionic, and metallic bonding, raising the pertinent question as to whether there is a well&#8208;defined transition between metavalent and covalent bonds. Here, three different pseudo&#8208;binary lines, namely, GeTe1&#8722;xSex, Sb2Te3(1&#8722;x)Se3x, and Bi2&#8722;2xSb2xSe3, are studied, and a sudden change in several properties, including optical absorption &#949;2(&#969;), optical dielectric constant &#949;&#8734;, Born effective charge Z*, electrical conductivity, as well as bond breaking behavior for a critical Se or Sb concentration, is evidenced. These findings provide a blueprint to experimentally explore the influence of metavalent bonding on attractive properties of phase&#8208;change materials and thermoelectrics. Particularly important is its impact on optical properties, which can be tailored by the amount of electrons shared between adjacent atoms. This correlation can be used to design optoelectronic materials and to explore systematic changes in chemical bonding with stoichiometry and atomic arrangement.

         <title>Photonic Bandgap in Achiral Liquid Crystals&#8212;A Twist on a Twist</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photonic bandgap phenomenon is observed in a liquid crystalline phase built of achiral molecules, in which a tendency to twist is caused by steric interactions between strongly bent molecules. A selective reflection of visible light appears due to unwinding of the helical structure at the transition between two smectic phases having a single&#8208; and double&#8208;helical structure.








Abstract
Achiral mesogenic molecules are shown to be able to spontaneously assemble into liquid crystalline smectic phases having either simple or double&#8208;helical structures. At the transition between these phases, the double&#8208;helical structure unwinds. As a consequence, in some temperature range, the pitch of the helix becomes comparable to the wavelength of visible light and the selective reflection of light in the visible range is observed. The photonic bandgap phenomenon is reported for achiral liquid crystals.

         <title>A Sustainable and Flexible Microbrush&#8208;Faced Triboelectric Generator for Portable/Wearable Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microbrush&#8208;faced triboelectric nanogenerator featuring high robustness, outstanding sustainability, and excellent durability displays remarkable capability for mechanical energy harvesting in separate working modes. Human&#8208;being&#8208;interactive triboelectrification with this device reveals outstanding power generation and durability, suggesting that it can serve as a power source for various types of handheld electronics.








Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are put forward as a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art energy&#8208;scavenging technology for self&#8208;powered electronics, but their severe wear and degradation driven by inevitable friction can pose significant durability and sustainability concerns. Here, an array of microfibers is reported that functions as a robust and sustainable TENG in both in&#8208;plane sliding and vertical contact&#8208;separation modes, with excellent electrical potential as high as 20&#160;V and a high cyclability of 3000. The design flexibility of this microbrush TENG (MB&#8208;TENG) on the counter materials facilitates the further improvement of electrical outputs, benefiting numerous applications of human&#8208;interactive triboelectrification. Significantly, these MB&#8208;TENGs offer sufficient output power for successfully driving a smartwatch as well as an electromyography module. This technology uses a simple and cost&#8208;effective manner to provide a robust and reliable monolithic TENG module, which is expected to serve as a promising energy&#8208;harvesting source for self&#8208;powered electronics in the near future.

Here, an array of microfibers is reported that functions as a robust and sustainable TENG in both in-plane sliding and vertical contact-separation modes, with excellent electrical potential as high as 20&#160;V and a high cyclability of 3000. The design flexibility of this microbrush TENG (MB-TENG) on the counter materials facilitates the further improvement of electrical outputs, benefiting numerous applications of human-interactive triboelectrification. Significantly, these MB-TENGs offer sufficient output power for successfully driving a smartwatch as well as an electromyography module. This technology uses a simple and cost-effective manner to provide a robust and reliable monolithic TENG module, which is expected to serve as a promising energy-harvesting source for self-powered electronics in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Laser&#8208;Induced Cooperative Transition in Molecular Electronic Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A major challenge in a supramolecular electronic crystal is switchable control of its hidden phase. The cooperative tuning of K&#8208;TCNQ through a pulsed electromagnetic field into an emergent electronic disorder state, enabling access to a long&#8208;lived (over 400 days) hidden conducting phase, is found. A switchable magneto&#8208;electronic bistability is realized in a broad temperature range from 2 to 360 K.








Abstract
The competing and non&#8208;equilibrium phase transitions, involving dynamic tunability of cooperative electronic and magnetic states in strongly correlated materials, show great promise in quantum sensing and information technology. To date, the stabilization of transient states is still in the preliminary stage, particularly with respect to molecular electronic solids. Here, a dynamic and cooperative phase in potassium&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (K&#8208;TCNQ) with the control of pulsed electromagnetic excitation is demonstrated. Simultaneous dynamic and coherent lattice perturbation with 8 ns&#160;pulsed laser (532&#160;nm, 15 MW&#160;cm&#8722;2, 10 Hz)&#160;in such a molecular electronic crystal initiates a stable long&#8208;lived (over 400 days) conducting paramagnetic state (&#8776;42 &#937;cm), showing the charge&#8211;spin bistability over a broad temperature range from 2 to 360 K. Comprehensive noise spectroscopy, in situ high&#8208;pressure measurements, electron spin resonance (ESR), theoretical model, and scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) studies provide further evidence that such a transition is cooperative, requiring a dedicated charge&#8211;spin&#8211;lattice decoupling to activate and subsequently stabilize nonequilibrium phase. The cooperativity triggered by ultrahigh&#8208;strain&#8208;rate (above 106 s&#8722;1) pulsed excitation offers a collective control toward the generation and stabilization of strongly correlated electronic and magnetic orders in molecular electronic solids and offers unique electro&#8208;magnetic phases with technological promises.

         <title>Daratumumab Immunopolymersome&#8208;Enabled Safe and CD38&#8208;Targeted Chemotherapy and Depletion of Multiple Myeloma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Immuno&#8208;nanomedicines are emerging targeted cancer therapeutics that might reshape the clinical treatment scheme. Novel fabrication of small and smart daratumumab immunopolymersomes is presented carrying vincristine sulfate that induce extraordinary potency and selectivity while mitigating systemic toxicity toward orthotopic multiple myeloma in vivo.








Abstract
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a second ranking hematological malignancy. Despite the fast advancement of new treatments such as bortezormib and daratumumab, MM patients remain incurable and tend to eventually become relapsed and drug&#8208;resistant. Development of novel therapies capable of depleting MM cells is strongly needed. Here, daratumumab immunopolymersomes carrying vincristine sulfate (Dar&#8208;IPs&#8208;VCR) are reported for safe and high&#8208;efficacy CD38&#8208;targeted chemotherapy and depletion of orthotopic MM in vivo. Dar&#8208;IPs&#8208;VCR made by postmodification via strain&#8208;promoted click reaction holds tailored antibody density (2.2, 4.4 to 8.7 Dar per IPs), superb stability, small size (43&#8211;49&#160;nm), efficacious VCR loading, and glutathione&#8208;responsive VCR release. Dar4.4&#8208;IPs&#8208;VCR induces exceptional anti&#8208;MM activity with an IC50 of 76 &#215; 10&#8722;12 m to CD38&#8208;positive LP&#8208;1&#160;MM cells, 12&#8208; and 20&#8208;fold enhancement over nontargeted Ps&#8208;VCR and free VCR controls, respectively. Intriguingly, mice bearing orthotopic LP&#8208;1&#8208;Luc MM following four cycles of i.v. administration of Dar4.4&#8208;IPs&#8208;VCR at 0.25&#160;mg VCR equiv. kg&#8722;1 reveal complete depletion of LP&#8208;1&#8208;Luc cells, superior survival rate to all controls, and no body weight loss. The bone and histological analyses indicate bare bone and organ damage. Dar&#8208;IPs&#8208;VCR appears as a safe and targeted treatment for CD38&#8208;overexpressed hematological malignancies.

         <title>Improving the Stability of Non&#8208;Noble&#8208;Metal M&#8211;N&#8211;C Catalysts for Proton&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Membrane Fuel Cells through M&#8211;N Bond Length and Coordination Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective and universal strategy is developed to improve the stability of M&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts in half&#8208;cell and H2&#8211;O2/air fuel cells by accurately regulating the M&#63743;N bond length/coordination. Interestingly, the Fe&#63743;N bond length/coordination of the catalysts are strongly dependent on the binding constant of Fe3+ and polymer in the precursors, which can be linked with their performance degradation in fuel cells.








Abstract
An effective and universal strategy is developed to enhance the stability of the non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal M&#8211;Nx/C catalyst in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) by improving the bonding strength between metal ions and chelating polymers, i.e., poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) homopolymer and poly(acrylic acid&#8211;maleic acid) (P(AA&#8208;MA)) copolymer with different AA/MA ratios. M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveal that the optimal P(AA&#8208;MA)&#8211;Fe&#8211;N catalyst with a higher Fe3+&#8211;polymer binding constant possesses longer Fe&#63743;N bonds and exclusive Fe&#8211;N4/C moiety compared to PAA&#8211;Fe&#8211;N, which consists of &#8776;15% low&#8208;coordinated Fe&#8211;N2/N3 structures. The optimized P(AA&#8208;MA)&#8211;Fe&#8211;N catalyst exhibits outstanding ORR activity and stability in both half&#8208;cell and PEMFC cathodes, with the retention rate of current density approaching 100% for the first 37 h at 0.55&#160;V in an H2&#8211;air fuel cell. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the Fe&#8211;N4/C site could optimize the difference between the adsorption energy of the Fe atoms on the support (Ead) and the bulk cohesive energy (Ecoh) relative to Fe&#8211;N2/N3 moieties, thereby strongly stabilizing Fe centers against demetalation.

         <title>Al&#8211;Ge&#8211;Al Nanowire Heterostructure: From Single&#8208;Hole Quantum Dot to Josephson Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly tunable superconducting&#8211;semiconducting hybrid junction based on intrinsic germanium (i&#8208;Ge) nanowires is revealed. Low&#8208;temperature transport measurements of ultrascaled monolithic Al&#8211;Ge&#8211;Al nanowire heterostructures featuring monocrystalline Al leads and abrupt Al&#8211;Ge interfaces demonstrate that such i&#8208;Ge quantum dot devices can be tuned to access three distinct regimes: single&#8208;hole&#8208;filling quantum dots, an intermediate sub&#8208;gap states regime, and a superconducting regime.








Abstract
Superconductor&#8211;semiconductor&#8211;superconductor heterostructures are attractive for both fundamental studies of quantum phenomena in low&#8208;dimensional hybrid systems as well as for future high&#8208;performance low power dissipating nanoelectronic and quantum devices. In this work, ultrascaled monolithic Al&#8211;Ge&#8211;Al nanowire heterostructures featuring monocrystalline Al leads and abrupt metal&#8211;semiconductor interfaces are used to probe the low&#8208;temperature transport in intrinsic Ge (i&#8208;Ge) quantum dots. In particular, demonstrating the ability to tune the Ge quantum dot device from completely insulating, through a single&#8208;hole&#8208;filling quantum dot regime, to a supercurrent regime, resembling a Josephson field effect transistor with a maximum critical current of 10 nA at a temperature of 390 mK. The realization of a Josephson field&#8208;effect transistor with high junction transparency provides a mechanism to study sub&#8208;gap transport mediated by Andreev states. The presented results reveal a promising intrinsic Ge&#8208;based architecture for hybrid superconductor&#8211;semiconductor devices for the study of Majorana zero modes and key components of quantum computing such as gatemons or gate tunable superconducting quantum interference devices.

&lt;p&gt;A highly tunable superconducting&#8211;semiconducting hybrid junction based on intrinsic germanium (i-Ge) nanowires is revealed. Low-temperature transport measurements of ultrascaled monolithic Al&#8211;Ge&#8211;Al nanowire heterostructures featuring monocrystalline Al leads and abrupt Al&#8211;Ge interfaces demonstrate that such i-Ge quantum dot devices can be tuned to access three distinct regimes: single-hole-filling quantum dots, an intermediate sub-gap states regime, and a superconducting regime.

         <title>Anisotropic Iridescence and Polarization Patterns in a Direct Ink Written Chiral Photonic Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by natural examples of patterned iridescence, an ink based on a chiral nematic liquid crystal that can be processed with a direct ink writer 3D printer is shown. Tuning the writing direction and speed leads to the programmed formation of a slanted photonic axis that exhibits atypical iridescence and polarization selectivity.








Abstract
The iridescence of structural color and its polarization characteristics originate from the nanoscale organization of materials. A major challenge in materials science is generating the bright, lustrous hues seen in nature through nanoscale engineering, while simultaneously controlling interaction of the material with different light polarizations. In this work, a suitable chiral nematic liquid crystal elastomer ink is synthesized for direct ink writing, which self&#8208;assembles into a chiral photonic structure. Tuning the writing direction and speed leads to the programmed formation of a slanted photonic axis, which exhibits atypical iridescence and polarization selectivity. After crosslinking, a freely programmable, chiroptical photonic polymer material is obtained. The strongly perspective&#8208;dependent appearance of the material can function as specialized anticounterfeit markers, as optical elements in decorative iridescent coatings, or, as demonstrated here, in optically based signaling features.

         <title>Dynamic Symmetry Breaking in Chiral Magnetic Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel domain growth behaviors are observed with respect to in&#8208;plane magnetic fields in [Co/Ni/Pt] multilayers with chiral N&#233;el&#8208;type domain walls (DWs), including growth perpendicular to the in&#8208;plane field axis. Accounting for steady&#8208;state DW dynamics, the reported model successfully predicts the magnetization and energetic profiles that promote these asymmetries. These results expand the utility of DW motion in probing chiral magnetism.








Abstract
The Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction (DMI) in magnetic systems stabilizes spin textures with preferred chirality, applicable to next&#8208;generation memory and computing architectures. In perpendicularly magnetized heavy&#8208;metal/ferromagnet films, the interfacial DMI originating from structural inversion asymmetry and strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling favors chiral N&#233;el&#8208;type domain walls (DWs) whose energetics and mobility remain at issue. Here, a new effect is characterized in which domains expand unidirectionally in response to a combination of out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane magnetic fields, with the growth direction controlled by the in&#8208;plane field strength. These growth directionalities and symmetries with applied fields cannot be understood from static treatments alone. The authors theoretically demonstrate that perpendicular field torques stabilize steady&#8208;state magnetization profiles highly asymmetric in elastic energy, resulting in a dynamic symmetry breaking consistent with the experimental findings. This phenomenon sheds light on the mechanisms governing the dynamics of N&#233;el&#8208;type DWs and expands the utility of field&#8208;driven DW motion to probe and control chiral DWs.

         <title>Reduced Intrinsic Non&#8208;Radiative Losses Allow Room&#8208;Temperature Triplet Emission from Purely Organic Emitters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substitution of a hydrogen atom with an N&#8208;phenyl ring is demonstrated to convert an organic material without phosphorescence emission into a molecular system exhibiting efficient and ultralong afterglow phosphorescence at room temperature, originating from a reduction of intrinsic non&#8208;radiative molecular relaxations, which can be used for data safety applications.








Abstract
Persistent luminescence from triplet excitons in organic molecules is rare, as fast non&#8208;radiative deactivation typically dominates over radiative transitions. This work demonstrates that the substitution of a hydrogen atom in a derivative of phenanthroimidazole with an N&#8208;phenyl ring can substantially stabilize the excited state. This stabilization converts an organic material without phosphorescence emission into a molecular system exhibiting efficient and ultralong afterglow phosphorescence at room temperature. Results from systematic photophysical investigations, kinetic modeling, excited&#8208;state dynamic modeling, and single&#8208;crystal structure analysis identify that the long&#8208;lived triplets originate from a reduction of intrinsic non&#8208;radiative molecular relaxations. Further modification of the N&#8208;phenyl ring with halogen atoms affects the afterglow lifetime and quantum yield. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, an anticounterfeiting device is demonstrated with a time&#8208;dependent Morse code feature for data encryption based on these emitters. A fundamental design principle is outlined to achieve long&#8208;lived and emissive triplet states by suppressing intrinsic non&#8208;radiative relaxations in the form of molecular vibrations or rotations.

         <title>54 cm2 Large&#8208;Area Flexible Organic Solar Modules with Efficiency Above 13%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient large&#8208;area flexible solar cells and modules are demonstrated based on a printable, transparent, low&#8208;surface&#8208;roughness, flexible electrode (silver nanowires:zinc&#8208;chelated polyethylenimine). A power conversion efficiency of 13.2% is obtained for a 54 cm2 solar module. The flexible electrode is also demonstrated in high&#8208;performance flexible quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes.








Abstract
Development of large&#8208;area flexible organic solar cells (OSCs) is highly desirable for their practical applications. However, the efficiency of the large&#8208;area flexible OSCs severely lags behind small&#8208;area devices. Here, efficient large&#8208;area flexible single cells with power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.1% and 12.6% for areas of 6 and 10 cm2, and flexible modules with a PCE of 13.2% (54 cm2) based on poly(ethylene terephthalate)/Ag grid/silver nanowires (AgNWs):zinc&#8208;chelated polyethylenimine (PEI&#8208;Zn) composite electrodes are reported. The solution&#8208;processed flexible transparent electrode of AgNWs:PEI&#8208;Zn shows low surface roughness and good optoelectronic and mechanical properties. PEI&#8208;Zn is conductive and optically transparent. It can adhere to and wrap the AgNWs under electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged surface (AgNWs) and positively charged protonated amine groups (in PEI&#8208;Zn). It wraps the AgNWs networks and fills the void space to achieve a smooth surface. The flexible electrode is validated in both flexible OSCs and flexible quantum&#8208;dots light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs). Small&#8208;area flexible OSCs show a PCE of 16.1%, and flexible QLEDs show an external quantum efficiency of 13.3%. In the end, a flexible module is demonstrated to charge a mobile phone as a flexible power source (shown in Video S1, Supporting Information).

         <title>A Bioresorbable Dynamic Pressure Sensor for Cardiovascular Postoperative Care</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioresorbable electronics that can be absorbed and become part of the organism after their service life are a new trend to avoid secondary invasive surgery. A flexible bioresorbable triboelectric pressure sensor is demonstrated based on the triboelectric effect. It can overcome the material limitations caused by the working principle. This device is expected to be applied in postoperative care.








Abstract
Bioresorbable electronics that can be absorbed and become part of the organism after their service life are a new trend to avoid secondary invasive surgery. However, the material limitation is a significant challenge. There are fewer biodegradable materials with pressure&#8208;sensitive properties. Here, a pressure sensor based on the triboelectric effect between bioabsorbable materials is reported. This effect is available in almost all materials. The bioresorbable triboelectric sensor (BTS) can directly convert ambient pressure changes into electrical signals. This device successfully identifies abnormal vascular occlusion events in large animals (dogs). The service life of the BTS reaches 5 days with a high service efficiency (5.95%). The BTS offers excellent sensitivity (11 mV&#160;mmHg&#8722;1), linearity (R2&#160;= 0.993), and good durability (450&#160;000 cycles). The antibacterial bioresorbable materials (poly(lactic acid)&#8211;(chitosan 4%)) for the BTS can achieve 99% sterilization. Triboelectric devices are expected to be applied in postoperative care as bioresorbable electronics.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Halide Perovskite Field&#8208;Effect Transistors by Ion Transport Mitigation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Realization of solution&#8208;processed halide perovskites transistors is challenging due to the presence of mobile ions. A generic strategy is demonstrated that can be applied for regulating ions in mixed ionic&#8211;electronic semiconductors and that enables the demonstration of perovskite transistors working at room&#8208;temperature by fixation of the mobile ions through ferroelectric polarization. 








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed halide perovskites have emerged as excellent optoelectronic materials for applications in photovoltaic solar cells and light&#8208;emitting diodes. However, the presence of mobile ions in the material hinders the development of perovskite field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) due to screening of the gate potential in the nearby perovskite channel, and the resulting impediment to achieving gate modulation of an electronic current at room temperature. Here, room&#8208;temperature operation is demonstrated in cesium lead tribromide (CsPbBr3) perovskite&#8208;based FETs using an auxiliary ferroelectric gate of poly(vinylidenefluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene) [P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)], to electrostatically fixate the mobile ions. The large interfacial polarization of the ferroelectric gate attracts the mobile ions away from the main nonferroelectric gate interface, thereby enabling modulation of the electronic current through the channel by the main gate. This strategy allows for realization of the p&#8208;type CsPbBr3 channel and revealing the thermally activated nature of the hole charge transport. The proposed strategy is generic and can be applied for regulating ions in a variety of ionic&#8211;electronic mixed semiconductors.

         <title>A Tandem Organic Photovoltaic Cell with 19.6% Efficiency Enabled by Light Distribution Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By fine&#8208;tuning the optical field distribution and employing photovoltaic materials with low energy losses in tandem photovoltaic cell, a power conversion efficiency of 19.64% is achieved.








Abstract
Despite more potential in realizing higher photovoltaic performance, the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of tandem organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells still lags behind that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art single&#8208;junction cells. In this work, highly efficient double&#8208;junction tandem OPV cells are fabricated by optimizing the photoactive layers with low voltage losses and developing an effective method to tune optical field distribution. The tandem OPV cells studied are structured as indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/bottom photoactive layer/interconnecting layer (ICL)/top photoactive layer/MoOx/Ag, where the bottom and top photoactive layers are based on blends of PBDB&#8208;TF:ITCC and PBDB&#8208;TF:BTP&#8208;eC11, respectively, and ICL refers to interconnecting layer structured as MoOx/Ag/ZnO:PFN&#8208;Br. As these results indicate that there is not much room for optimizing the bottom photoactive layer, more effort is put into fine&#8208;tuning the top photoactive layer. By rationally modulating the composition and thickness of PBDB&#8208;TF:BTP&#8208;eC11 blend films, the 300 nm&#8208;thick PBDB&#8208;TF:BTP&#8208;eC11 film with 1:2 D/A ratio is found to be an ideal photoactive layer for the top sub&#8208;cell in terms of photovoltaic characteristics and light distribution control. For the optimized tandem cell, a PCE of 19.64% is realized, which is the highest result in the OPV field and certified as 19.50% by the National Institute of Metrology.

         <title>Magnetization Signature of Topological Surface States in a Non&#8208;Symmorphic Superconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly anomalous surface superconductivity is reported in a non&#8208;symmorphic superconductor, In2Bi, where the nontrivial band structure results in the existence of topologically protected surface states (TSS). The near&#8208;perfect screening of low&#8208;frequency magnetic fields well above the upper critical field is explained by proximity superconductivity of TSS. Detecting TSS via macroscopic magnetization provides a new tool for identification of topological superconductors.








Abstract
Superconductors with nontrivial band structure topology represent a class of materials with unconventional and potentially useful properties. Recent years have seen much success in creating artificial hybrid structures exhibiting the main characteristics of 2D topological superconductors. Yet, bulk materials known to combine inherent superconductivity with nontrivial topology remain scarce, largely because distinguishing their central characteristic&#8212;the topological surface states&#8212;has proved challenging due to a dominant contribution from the superconducting bulk. In this work, a highly anomalous behavior of surface superconductivity in topologically nontrivial 3D superconductor In2Bi, where the surface states result from its nontrivial band structure, itself a consequence of the non&#8208;symmorphic crystal symmetry and strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling, is reported. In contrast to smoothly decreasing diamagnetic susceptibility above the bulk critical field, Hc2, as seen in conventional superconductors, a near&#8208;perfect, Meissner&#8208;like screening of low&#8208;frequency magnetic fields well above Hc2 is observed. The enhanced diamagnetism disappears at a new phase transition close to the critical field of surface superconductivity, Hc3. Using theoretical modeling, the anomalous screening is shown to be consistent with modification of surface superconductivity by the topological surface states. The possibility of detecting signatures of the surface states using macroscopic magnetization provides a new tool for the discovery and identification of topological superconductors.

         <title>Homogeneous Carbon/Potassium&#8208;Incorporation Strategy for Synthesizing Red Polymeric Carbon Nitride Capable of Near&#8208;Infrared Photocatalytic H2 Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solid&#8208;salt&#8208;induced homogeneous incorporation strategy realizes red carbon/potassium&#8208;incorporated polymeric carbon nitride, which exhibits highly efficient H2 evolution from water and in situ hydrogen gas (drug&#8208;free) cancer therapy excited by near&#8208;infrared light.








Abstract
The efficient utilization of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light for photocatalytic hydrogen generation is vitally important to both solar hydrogen energy and hydrogen medicine, but remains a challenge at present, owing to the strict requirement of the semiconductor for high NIR responsiveness, narrow bandgap, and suitable redox potentials. Here, an NIR&#8208;active carbon/potassium&#8208;doped red polymeric carbon nitride (RPCN) is achieved for by using a similar&#8208;structure dopant as the melamine (C3H6N6) precursor with the solid KCl. The homogeneous and high incorporation of carbon and potassium remarkably narrows the bandgap of carbon nitride (1.7&#160;eV) and endows RPCN with a high NIR&#8208;photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution from water at the rate of 140 &#181;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 under NIR irradiation (700 nm &#8804; &#955;&#160;&#8804; 780&#160;nm), and the apparent quantum efficiency is high as 0.84% at 700 &#177; 10&#160;nm (and 13% at 500 &#177; 10&#160;nm). A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment on a tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model verifies RPCN as being capable of intratumoral NIR&#8208;photocatalytic hydrogen generation and simultaneous glutathione deprivation for safe and high&#8208;efficacy drug&#8208;free cancer therapy. The results shed light on designing efficient photocatalysts to capture the full spectrum of solar energy, and also pioneer a new pathway to develop NIR photocatalysts for hydrogen therapy of major diseases.

         <title>Engineering Endogenous Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophage&#8208;Targeted Biomimetic Nano&#8208;RBC to Reprogram Tumor Immunosuppressive Microenvironment for Enhanced Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>

         <dc:description>
An endogenous tumor&#8208;associated macrophage (TAM)&#8208;targeted biomimetic nano red blood cell (nano&#8208;RBC) system is engineered via self&#8208;assembly of a hemoglobin&#8211;poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (Hb&#8211;PCL) conjugate for enhanced cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy. The doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;loaded nano&#8208;RBC (V(Hb)@DOX) can innately target to decrease the number of immunosuppressive TAMs. Moreover, the O2 released from nano&#8208;RBC relieves tumor hypoxia, which further reprograms the immunosuppressive state to stimulate antitumor responses. The synergistic chemo&#8208;immunotherapy effectively suppresses tumor growth, inhibits metastasis, and prevents autologous tumor recurrence.








Abstract
Immunotherapy has shown encouraging results in various cancers, but the response rates are relatively low due to the complex tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment (TIME). The presence of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) and tumor hypoxia correlates significantly with potent immunosuppressive activity. Here, a hemoglobin&#8211;poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (Hb&#8211;PCL) conjugate self&#8208;assembled biomimetic nano red blood cell (nano&#8208;RBC) system (V(Hb)) is engineered to deliver chemotherapeutic doxorubicin (DOX) and oxygen for reprogramming TIME. The Hb moiety of V(Hb)@DOX can bind to endogenous plasma haptoglobin (Hp) and specifically target the M2&#8208;type TAMs via the CD163 surface receptor, and effectively kill the cells. In addition, the O2 released by the Hb alleviates tumor hypoxia, which further augments the antitumor immune response by recruiting fewer M2&#8208;type macrophages. TAM&#8208;targeting depletion and hypoxia alleviation synergistically reprogram the TIME, which concurrently downregulate PD&#8208;L1 expression of tumor cells, decrease the levels of immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL&#8208;10 and TGF&#8208;&#946;, elevate the immunostimulatory IFN&#8208;&#947;, enhance cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response, and boost a strong memory response. The ensuing TAM&#8208;targeted chemo&#8208;immunotherapeutic effects markedly inhibit tumor metastasis and recurrence. Taken together, the engineered endogenous TAM&#8208;targeted biomimetic nano&#8208;RBC system is a highly promising tool to reprogram TIME for cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Atomic Layers of Transition&#8208;Metal Carbides (MXenes)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy atomic layers of transition&#8208;metal carbide (HE&#8208;MXene) are produced via selectively etching a high&#8208;entropy MAX phase, in which five transition&#8208;metal species are homogeneously dispersed into one MX slab, giving rise to stable transition&#8208;metal carbide in the atomic layers. The resultant HE&#8208;MXene has distinct lattice distortions and strains, efficiently guiding the nucleation and uniform growth of lithium.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs) have great potential for energy storage and conversion due to their diverse compositions, and unexpected physical and chemical features. However, high&#8208;entropy atomic layers with fully exposed active sites are difficult to synthesize since their phases are easily segregated. Here, it is demonstrated that high&#8208;entropy atomic layers of transition&#8208;metal carbide (HE&#8208;MXene) can be produced via the selective etching of novel high&#8208;entropy MAX (also termed Mn+1AXn (n&#160;= 1, 2, 3), where M represents an early transition&#8208;metal element, A is an element mainly from groups 13&#8211;16, and X stands for C and/or N) phase (HE&#8208;MAX) (Ti1/5V1/5Zr1/5Nb1/5Ta1/5)2AlC, in which the five transition&#8208;metal species are homogeneously dispersed into one MX slab due to their solid&#8208;solution feature, giving rise to a stable transition&#8208;metal carbide in the atomic layers owing to the high molar configurational entropy and correspondingly low Gibbs free energy. Additionally, the resultant high&#8208;entropy MXene with distinct lattice distortions leads to high mechanical strain into the atomic layers. Moreover, the mechanical strain can efficiently guide the nucleation and uniform growth of dendrite&#8208;free lithium on HE&#8208;MXene, achieving a long cycling stability of up to 1200 h and good deep stripping&#8211;plating levels of up to 20 mAh cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Wavelength&#8208;Selective Softening of Hydrogel Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly selective photochemical behavior of three chromophores with distinct degradation wavelengths is exploited for the construction of selectively degradable hydrogels. Specifically, hydrogel softening can be achieved in a stepwise fashion according to the chromophores&#8217; activation wavelength, enabling fine control over the hydrogel's mechanical properties.








Abstract
Photoresponsive hydrogels hold key potential in advanced biomedical applications including tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and drug delivery, as well as intricately engineered functions such as biosensing, soft robotics, and bioelectronics. Herein, the wavelength&#8208;dependent degradation of bio&#8208;orthogonal poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogels is reported, using three selective activation levels. Specifically, three chromophores are exploited, that is, ortho&#8208;nitrobenzene, dimethyl aminobenzene, and bimane, each absorbing light at different wavelengths. By examining their photochemical action plots, the wavelength&#8208;dependent reactivity of the photocleavable moieties is determined. The wavelength&#8208;selective addressability of individual photoreactive units is subsequently translated into hydrogel design, enabling wavelength&#8208;dependent cleavage of the hydrogel networks on&#8208;demand. Critically, this platform technology allows for the fabrication of various hydrogels, whose mechanical properties can be fine&#8208;tuned using different colors of light to reach a predefined value, according to the chromophore ratios used. The softening is shown to influence the spreading of pre&#8208;osteoblastic cells adhering to the gels as a demonstration of their potential utility. Furthermore, the materials and photodegradation processes are non&#8208;toxic to cells, making this platform attractive for biomaterials engineering.

Chiral Photonic Polymers
In article number 2103309, Albertus P. H. J. Schenning, Michael G. Debije, and co&#8208;workers show that using direct ink writing, unconventional chiral nematic objects can be generated, which show a bright iridescent color from normal incidence, or only from sharp angles of observation depending on the writing speed. The cover is a polarized optical microscopy image showing a detail from the free&#8208;standing Morpho&#8208;inspired print.

MXenes
In article number 2103393, Michael Naguib,  Michel W. Barsoum, and Yury Gogotsi present a brief historical overview of the first 10 years of MXene research and a perspective on their synthesis and future development. The cover shows a colored SEM image of a multilayer Ti3C2 MXene particle with an accordion&#8208;like morphology, which is produced by individual MXene layers stacked together. The variety of colors represents the diversity of MXene structures and compositions. Image Credit: The SEM image was taken by Dr. Tyler Mathis and colored by Dr. Armin VahidMohammadi.

Cancer Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy
In article number 2103497, Yubin Huang, Dongfang Zhou, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate an engineered endogenous tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs)&#8208;targeting biomimetic nano&#8208;red&#8208;blood&#8208;cell (RBC) system to deliver chemotherapeutic doxorubicin and oxygen for enhanced cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy. TAMs&#8208;targeting depletion and hypoxia alleviation synergistically reprogram the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. The ensuing TAMs&#8208;targeted chemo&#8208;immunotherapeutic effects markedly inhibit tumor metastasis and recurrence.

Porous Carbon Materials
Reversible stretchability is challenging to achieve for porous carbon materials. In article number 2102724, Shu&#8208;Hong Yu and co&#8208;workers report a porous all&#8208;carbon material achieving both elastic compressibility and stretchability at large strains by designing a unique long&#8208;range lamellar multi&#8208;arch microstructure. Its superior performance makes it a good platform for making high&#8208;performance contact vibration sensors and noncontact magnetic sensors.

Supramolecular Electronic Crystals
The cooperative tuning of a supramolecular electronic crystal enables access to a long&#8208;lived hidden conducting phase with a broad temperature range from 2 to 360 K, through a pulsed electromagnetic field. In article number 2103000, Shenqiang Ren and co&#8208;workers demonstrate a a dynamic and cooperative phase in K&#8208;TCNQ, with the control of pulsed electromagnetic excitation. A dedicated charge&#8211;spin&#8211;lattice decoupling is required to activate and subsequently stabilize the non&#8208;equilibrium phase.

         <dc:description>
The recent progress of MXenes synthesis strategies, including etching, intercalation, and delamination, is summarized. The large&#8208;scale preparation methods for MXenes and their derivates, such as flexible membranes and fibers, are discussed. Moreover, the understanding of the oxidation stability of MXenes and stable storage strategies are also addressed.








Abstract
2D transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides, also known as MXenes, are versatile materials due to their adjustable structure and rich surface chemistry. The physical and chemical diversity has recognized MXenes as a potential 2D material with a wide spectrum of application domains. Since the discovery of MXenes in 2011, a wide variety of synthetic routes has been proposed with advancement toward large&#8208;scale preparing methods for MXene nanosheets and derivative products. Herein, the critical synthesis aspects and the operating conditions that influence the physical and chemical characteristics of MXenes are discussed in detail. The emerging etching methods including HF etching methods, in situ HF&#8208;forming etching methods, electrochemical etching methods, alkali etching methods, and molten salt etching methods, as well as delamination strategies are discussed. Considering the future developments and practical applications, the large&#8208;scale synthesis routes and the antioxidation strategies of MXenes are also summarized. In summary, a generalized overview of MXenes synthesis protocols with an outlook for the current challenges and promising technologies for large&#8208;scale preparation and stable storage is provided.

         <title>Rational Design of Immunomodulatory Hydrogels for Chronic Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quality and duration of the healing process can be regulated via modulation of immune responses to tissue injury. Specifically, controlling pro&#8208;inflammatory phenotype&#8211;anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype progression is a crucial step to ensure a conversion from the inflammatory to the healing stage. In this regard, immunomodulatory hydrogels with specific chemistry and surface properties can influence immune cell polarization and the chronic wound healing process.








Abstract
With all the advances in tissue engineering for construction of fully functional skin tissue, complete regeneration of chronic wounds is still challenging. Since immune reaction to the tissue damage is critical in regulating both the quality and duration of chronic wound healing cascade, strategies to modulate the immune system are of importance. Generally, in response to an injury, macrophages switch from pro&#8208;inflammatory to an anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype. Therefore, controlling macrophages&#8217; polarization has become an appealing approach in regenerative medicine. Recently, hydrogels&#8208;based constructs, incorporated with various cellular and molecular signals, have been developed and utilized to adjust immune cell functions in various stages of wound healing. Here, the current state of knowledge on immune cell functions during skin tissue regeneration is first discussed. Recent advanced technologies used to design immunomodulatory hydrogels for controlling macrophages&#8217; polarization are then summarized. Rational design of hydrogels for providing controlled immune stimulation via hydrogel chemistry and surface modification, as well as incorporation of cell and molecules, are also dicussed. In addition, the effects of hydrogels&#8217; properties on immunogenic features and the wound healing process are summarized. Finally, future directions and upcoming research strategies to control immune responses during chronic wound healing are highlighted.
