         <title>Transformable ECM Deprivation System Effectively Suppresses Renal Cell Carcinoma by Reversing Anoikis Resistance and Increasing Chemotherapy Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transformable extracellular matrix (ECM) deprivation system (EDS) deprives the ECM of tumors and restraints cancer progression by targeting fibronectin (FN). The cage&#8208;like nanofibers deprive the ECM of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells, which block the FN&#8208;mediated tumor&#8208;promoting signaling and ultimately reverse anoikis resistance and ameliorate cell adhesion&#8208;mediated drug resistance (CAM&#8208;DR).








Abstract
Extracellular matrix (ECM) is crucial in various biological functions during tumor progression, including induction of anoikis resistance and cell adhesion&#8208;mediated drug resistance (CAM&#8208;DR). Fibronectin (FN) is a vital ECM component with direct regulatory effects on ECM&#8208;mediated anoikis resistance and CAM&#8208;DR, making it an attractive and innovative therapeutic target for depriving ECM in tumor tissue. Herein, an ECM deprivation system (EDS) is developed based on FN targeting self&#8208;assembly peptide for constructing nanofibers in the ECM of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which contributes to: i) targeting and recognizing FN to form nanofibers for long&#8208;term retention in ECM, ii) reversing anoikis resistance via arresting the FN signaling pathway, and iii) serving as a drug&#8208;loading platform for sensitizing chemotherapy by ameliorating CAM&#8208;DR. The results reveal that EDS significantly reverses anoikis resistance of RCC cells by inhibiting the phosphorylation of FAK, a positive regulator of the FN signaling pathway. Meanwhile, EDS serves as a chemotherapy&#8208;sensitizer of cancer, exerting significant synergistic effects with doxorubicin (DOX). In vivo validation experiments show that EDS effectively suppresses metastasis and tumor growth with chemotherapy resistance. Collectively, the innovative EDS notably inhibits the tumor&#8208;promoting effect of ECM and may provide a novel approach for suppressing ECM and enhancing chemo&#8208;drug sensitivity.

         <title>Enhanced Competition at the Nano&#8211;Bio Interface Enables Comprehensive Characterization of Protein Corona Dynamics and Deep Coverage of Proteomes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By increasing competition at the nano&#8211;bio interface, protein corona diversity and detection of low&#8208;abundance proteins such as cytokines and chemokines are significantly improved. Quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) data captures corona dynamics for 3000 individual proteins and provides a crucial resource for in&#8208;depth modeling of nano&#8211;bio interactions and the Vroman effect for in vitro and in vivo applications of nanomaterials.








Abstract
Introducing engineered nanoparticles (NPs) into a biofluid such as blood plasma leads to the formation of a selective and reproducible protein corona at the particle&#8211;protein interface, driven by the relationship between protein&#8211;NP affinity and protein abundance. This enables&#160;scalable systems that leverage protein&#8211;nano interactions to&#160;overcome current limitations of deep plasma proteomics in large cohorts. Here the importance of the protein to NP&#8208;surface ratio (P/NP) is demonstrated and protein corona formation dynamics are modeled, which determine the competition between proteins for binding. Tuning the P/NP ratio significantly modulates the protein corona composition, enhancing depth and precision of a fully automated NP&#8208;based deep proteomic workflow (Proteograph). By increasing the binding competition on engineered NPs, 1.2&#8211;1.7&#215; more proteins with 1% false discovery rate are identified on the surface of each NP, and up to 3&#215; more proteins compared to a standard plasma proteomics workflow. Moreover, the data suggest P/NP plays a significant role in determining the in vivo fate of nanomaterials in biomedical applications. Together, the study showcases the importance of P/NP as a key design element for biomaterials and nanomedicine in vivo and as a powerful tuning strategy for accurate, large&#8208;scale NP&#8208;based deep proteomic studies.

         <title>Carbon Surface Chemistry: New Insight into the Old Story</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The significant progress in the synthesis of novel carbon materials and the promising prospects of their applications in various advanced areas bring an unprecedented boom in the carbon community. In this work, properties of different defective structures related to carbon surface chemistry, which may lead to an important influence on their performance without being noticed, are discussed.








Abstract
The enormous complexity of the carbon material family has provoked a phenomenological approach to develop its potential in different applications. Although the electronic, chemical, mechanical, and magnetic properties of carbon materials have been widely discussed based on defect control engineering, there is still a lack of fundamental understanding of the carbon surface chemistry, which leads to many controversial conclusions. Here, by analyzing various defects on carbon surface, some commonly neglected aspects and misunderstandings in this field are pointed out, clarifying how surface chemistry affects the chemical behaviors of carbon in some specific chemical reactions. With this full&#8208;scale consideration of the carbon surface chemistry, the behaviors of carbon materials with various functions can be well defined, which is indispensable for their scalable applications. Perspectives on future developments of carbon surface chemistry are also provided to enable practically accessible design of advanced carbon in those applications.

         <title>Macroscopic Heterostructure Membrane of Graphene Oxide /Porous Graphene/Graphene Oxide for Selective Separation of Deuterium Water from Natural Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Deuterium water (D2O) is strategic material that is widely used in nuclear weapons, civilian nuclear energy, and scientific research. However, its content in natural water is extremely low. Therefore, the development of a room temperature technology for achieving simple, efficient, and low&#8208;cost separation of D2O from natural water is challenging. In this study, porous graphene (PG) nanosheets with &#8220;crater&#8208;like&#8221; pores were sandwiched between two layers of graphene oxide (GO) membranes to prepare a GO/PG/GO membrane with a macroscopic heterostructure, which can be used to separate D2O and H2O by pressure&#8208;driven filtration. At 25 &#176;C, the rejection rate of D2O was approximately 97%, the selectivity of H2O/D2O was approximately 35.2, and the excellent performance could be attributed to the difference of transmembrane resistance and flow state of H2O and D2O in the confinement state. In addition, the D2O concentration in natural water was successfully enriched from 0.013% to 0.059% using only one stage and the membrane exhibited excellent structural and cycling stability. Therefore, this method did not require ultra&#8208;low temperatures, high energy supplies, complex separation equipment, or the introduction of toxic chemicals. Thus, it can be directly applied to the large&#8208;scale industrial production and removal of D2O.

         <title>Effect of Magnetic Impurities on Superconductivity in LaH10</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anderson's theorem states that nonmagnetic impurities do not affect the isotropic order parameter in Bardeen&#8211;Cooper&#8211;Schrieffer (BCS) superconductors, whereas scattering on paramagnetic centers is very efficient in destroying the s&#8208;wave superconductivity. This work&#160;demonstrates that LaH10, the best so far known superconductor, obeys Anderson's theorem, which makes it possible to adjust its critical temperature for a specific application.








Abstract
Polyhydrides are a novel class of superconducting materials with extremely high critical parameters, which is very promising for sensor applications. On the other hand, a complete experimental study of the best so far known superconductor, lanthanum superhydride LaH10, encounters a serious complication because of the large upper critical magnetic field HC2(0), exceeding 120&#8211;160&#160;T. It is found that partial replacement of La atoms by magnetic Nd atoms results in significant suppression of superconductivity in LaH10: each at% of Nd causes a decrease in TC by 10&#8211;11&#160;K, helping to control the critical parameters of this compound.

     alt="Effect of Magnetic Impurities on Superconductivity in LaH10"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anderson's theorem states that nonmagnetic impurities do not affect the isotropic order parameter in Bardeen&#8211;Cooper&#8211;Schrieffer (BCS) superconductors, whereas scattering on paramagnetic centers is very efficient in destroying the s-wave superconductivity. This work&#160;demonstrates that LaH&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, the best so far known superconductor, obeys Anderson's theorem, which makes it possible to adjust its critical temperature for a specific application.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polyhydrides are a novel class of superconducting materials with extremely high critical parameters, which is very promising for sensor applications. On the other hand, a complete experimental study of the best so far known superconductor, lanthanum superhydride LaH&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, encounters a serious complication because of the large upper critical magnetic field &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;C2&lt;/sub&gt;(0), exceeding 120&#8211;160&#160;T. It is found that partial replacement of La atoms by magnetic Nd atoms results in significant suppression of superconductivity in LaH&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;: each at% of Nd causes a decrease in &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; by 10&#8211;11&#160;K, helping to control the critical parameters of this compound. Strong pulsed magnetic fields up to 68&#160;T are used to study the Hall effect, magnetoresistance, and the magnetic phase diagram of ternary metal polyhydrides for the first time. Surprisingly, (La,Nd)H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; demonstrates completely linear &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;C2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;)&#160;&#8733;&#160;|&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; &#8211;&#160;&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;|, which calls into question the applicability of the Werthamer&#8211;Helfand&#8211;Hohenberg model for polyhydrides. The suppression of superconductivity in LaH&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; by magnetic Nd atoms and the robustness of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; with respect to nonmagnetic impurities (e.g., Y, Al, C) under Anderson's theorem gives new experimental evidence of the isotropic (s-wave) character of conventional electron&#8211;phonon pairing in lanthanum decahydride.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Making Highly Elastic and Tough Hydrogels from Doughs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A hydrogel is often fabricated from preexisting polymer chains by covalently crosslinking them into a polymer network. The crosslinks make the hydrogel swell&#8208;resistant but brittle. This conflict is resolved here by making a hydrogel from a dough. The dough is formed by mixing long polymer chains with a small amount of water and photoinitiator. The dough is then homogenized by kneading and annealing at elevated temperatures, during which the crowded polymer chains densely entangle. The polymer chains are then sparsely crosslinked into a polymer network under an ultraviolet lamp, and submerged in water to swell to equilibrium. The resulting hydrogel is both swell&#8208;resistant and tough. The hydrogel also has near&#8208;perfect elasticity, high strength, high fatigue resistance, and low friction. The method is demonstrated with widely used polymers, poly(ethylene glycol) and cellulose. These hydrogels have never been made swell&#8208;resistant, elastic, and tough before. The method is generally applicable to synthetic and natural polymers, and is compatible with industrial processing technologies, opening doors to the development of sustainable, high&#8208;performance hydrogels.

         <title>Unique Role of GeO2 as a Noninvasive Promoter of Nano&#8208;sized Zeolite Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The synthesis of zeolites with nano&#8208;sized dimensions is often limited to a narrow design space that conventionally relies upon the design of organics to direct hierarchical materials. Here, we demonstrate that the addition of an inorganic modifier, germanium oxide, to a zeolite growth mixture directs the formation of crystals with ultra&#8208;small dimensions. This effect was observed for both MEL&#8208; and MFI&#8208;type frameworks over a range of synthesis conditions wherein the role of GeO2 in zeolite crystallization deviates from its typical function as a heteroatom. Notably, the final products contain trace amounts of Ge, which indicates the inorganic modifier does not compete for sites in the zeolite framework based on its formation of a discrete phase that enables GeO2 recovery. Catalytic tests using the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons reaction reveal significant enhancement in the performance of zeolite catalysts prepared with GeO2 compared to reported examples of nano&#8208;sized MFI and MEL zeolites. These findings highlight a potentially generalizable and commercially viable synthesis method to reduce mass transport limitations in zeolites for diverse applications.

         <title>Biomimetic Polymeric Nanoparticle&#8208;Mediated Chemotherapy Potentiates Enhanced Tumor Immunotherapy via Amplification of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Mitochondrial Dysfunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Construction of multifunctional nanoplatforms to elevate chemotherapeutic efficacy and induce long&#8208;term antitumor immunity still remains to be an extreme challenge. Herein, we report the design of an advanced redox&#8208;responsive nanomedicine formulation based on phosphorus dendrimer&#8208;copper(II) complexes (1G3&#8208;Cu)&#8208; and toyocamycin (Toy)&#8208;loaded polymeric nanoparticles (GCT NPs) coated with cancer cell membranes (CM). The designed GCT@CM NPs with a size of 210 nm are stable under a physiological condition but are rapidly dissociated in the reductive tumor microenvironment to deplete glutathione and release drugs. The co&#8208;loading of 1G3&#8208;Cu and Toy within the NPs causes significant tumor cell apoptosis and immunogenic cell death through 1G3&#8208;Cu&#8208;induced mitochondrial dysfunction and Toy&#8208;mediated amplification of endoplasmic reticulum stress, respectively, thus effectively suppressing tumor growth, promoting dendritic cell maturation, and increasing tumor&#8208;infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Likewise, the coated CM and the loaded 1G3&#8208;Cu render the GCT@CM NPs with homotypic targeting and T1&#8208;weighted magnetic resonance imaging of tumors, respectively. With the assistance of programmed cell death ligand 1 antibody, the GCT@CM NP&#8208;mediated chemotherapy can significantly potentiate tumor immunotherapy for effective inhibition of tumor recurrence and metastasis. The developed GCT@CM NPs hold a great potential for chemotherapy&#8208;potentiated immunotherapy of different tumor types through different mechanisms or synergies.

         <title>Engineering Electro&#8208;Optic BaTiO3 Nanocrystals via Efficient Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electro&#8208;optic (EO) modulators provide electrical&#8208;to&#8208;optical signal conversion relevant to optical communications. Barium titanate (BaTiO3) is a promising material system for EO modulation in light of its optical ultrafast nonlinearity, low optical loss, and high refractive index. To enhance further its spontaneous polarization, BaTiO3 can be doped at the Ba and Ti sites; however, doping is often accompanied by ion migration, which diminishes EO performance. Here we investigate donor&#8208;acceptor doping and its effect on EO efficiency, finding that La&#8208;doped BaTiO3 achieves an EO coefficient of 42 pm/V at 1&#160;kHz, fully twice that of the pristine specimen; however, we also observe that, with this single&#8208;element doping, the EO response falls off rapidly with frequency. From impedance spectroscopy, we find that frequency&#8208;dependent EO is correlated with ion migration. Density functional theory calculations predict that the ion migration barrier decreases with La3+ doping but can be recovered with further Mn2+ doping, a finding that prompts us to prevent ion migration by incorporating Mn2+ into the Ti&#8208;site to compensate for the charge imbalance.

         <title>Multi Jet Fusion 3D voxel printing of conductive elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) voxel printing enables site&#8208;specific variation of materials and properties at a voxel scale in one printed part, but it is currently limited to building voxelated parts with varying mechanical properties and colors. Here, we report the design and fabrication of voxelated conductive elastomers using Multi Jet Fusion 3D voxel printing actualized by a newly developed multifunctional agent (MA). The MA mainly consists of carbon nanotubes and poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate, serving as an infrared absorbing colorant, reinforcement, and conductive fillers. By controlling drop&#8208;on&#8208;demand agent dispensing on thermoplastic polyurethane powder, a wide range of electrical conductivity, ranging from 10&#8211;10 S/cm to 10&#8211;1 S/cm, can be tailored across a single printed part at a voxel resolution of &#8764;100&#160;&#956;m. Assembly&#8208;free strain sensors comprising conductive sensing layers and insulating frames are fabricated to demonstrate the capability of the technique in manufacturing all&#8208;printed wearable devices.

Here, we report the design and fabrication of voxelated conductive elastomers using Multi Jet Fusion 3D voxel printing actualized by a newly developed multifunctional agent (MA). The MA mainly consists of carbon nanotubes and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate, serving as an infrared absorbing colorant, reinforcement, and conductive fillers. By controlling drop-on-demand agent dispensing on thermoplastic polyurethane powder, a wide range of electrical conductivity, ranging from 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;10&lt;/sup&gt; S/cm to 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; S/cm, can be tailored across a single printed part at a voxel resolution of &#8764;100&#160;&#956;m. Assembly-free strain sensors comprising conductive sensing layers and insulating frames are fabricated to demonstrate the capability of the technique in manufacturing all-printed wearable devices.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Greenificated Molecularly Imprinted Materials for Advanced Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Greenificated molecularly imprinted polymers (GMIPs), possessing the potential to meet all current &#8220;sustainability&#8221; requirements, are being intensively developed to solve the key issues related to revolutionary technologies. Herein, a comprehensive review of the advanced applications of GMIPs in fast&#8208;growing and emerging fields is summarized, involving &#8220;GREENIFICATION&#8221; principles, preparation strategies, GMIPs&#8217; features, obscure technical challenges, critical thoughts, and prospective trends.








Abstract
Molecular imprinting technology (MIT) produces artificial binding sites with precise complementarity to substrates and thereby is capable of exquisite molecular recognition. Over five decades of evolution, it is predicted that the resulting host imprinted materials will overtake natural receptors for research and application purposes, but in practice, this has not yet been realized due to the unsustainability of their life cycles (i.e., precursors, creation, use, recycling, and end&#8208;of&#8208;life). To address this issue, greenificated molecularly imprinted polymers (GMIPs) are a new class of plastic antibodies that have approached sustainability by following one or more of the greenification principles, while also demonstrating more far&#8208;reaching applications compared to their natural counterparts. In this review, the most recent developments in the delicate design and advanced application of GMIPs in six fast&#8208;growing and emerging fields are surveyed, namely biomedicine/therapy, catalysis, energy harvesting/storage, nanoparticle detection, gas sensing/adsorption, and environmental remediation. In addition, their distinct features are highlighted, and the optimal means to utilize these features for attaining incredibly far&#8208;reaching applications are discussed. Importantly, the obscure technical challenges of the greenificated MIT are revealed, and conceivable solutions are offered. Lastly, several perspectives on future research directions are proposed.

         <title>Establishing Self&#8208;Dopant Design Principles from Structure&#8211;Function Relationships in Self&#8208;n&#8208;Doped Perylene Diimide Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A circumscribed set of design principles that relate structure to material observables is analyzed to disentangle the effects of how counterion, tether length, and steric encumbrance affect doping levels, thermal activation, and stability of self&#8208;doped organic semiconductors.








Abstract
Self&#8208;doping is a particular doping method that has been applied to a wide range of organic semiconductors. However, there is a lack of understanding regarding the relationship between dopant structure and function. A structurally diverse series of self&#8208;n&#8208;doped perylene diimides (PDIs) is investigated to study the impact of steric encumbrance, counterion selection, and dopant/PDI tether distance on functional parameters such as doping, stability, morphology, and charge&#8208;carrier mobility. The studies show that self&#8208;n&#8208;doping is best enabled by the use of sterically encumbered ammoniums with short tethers and Lewis basic counterions. Additionally, water is found to inhibit doping, which concludes that thermal degradation is merely a phenomenological feature of certain dopants, and that residual solvent evaporation is the primary driver of thermally activated doping. In situ grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering studies show that sample annealing increases the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance and shrinks grain boundaries for improved long&#8208;range ordering. These features are then correlated to contactless carrier&#8208;mobility measurements with time&#8208;resolved microwave conductivity before and after thermal annealing. The collective relationships between structural features and functionality are finally used to establish explicit self&#8208;n&#8208;dopant design principles for the future design of materials with improved functionality.

         <title>Thermoformable Boron Nitride Based All&#8208;Ceramics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrically insulating thermoformable ceramic matrix composites, for low&#8208;profile thermal management, take advantage of phononic conducting networks to transport heat from the heat source. This advancement and new field of study outlined in this work, show significant promise to enable size reduction and effective cooling advantage over the incumbent aluminum metal heat sinks.








Abstract
Thermoforming processing, traditionally reserved for thermoplastic polymers and sheet metals, is extended here to boron&#8208;based all&#8208;ceramics. Specifically, sintered boron nitride composite sheets manufactured via a combined vibration and tape&#8208;casting photopolymerization process exhibit a highly oriented microstructure that allows these preform sheets to flow as viscous Bingham pseudoplastics during compression molding. These sintered all&#8208;ceramic preforms are thermoformed into thin, complex parts with features down to 200&#160;&#181;m. Further, a new workflow is leveraged to generate bespoke all&#8208;ceramic heat spreaders that can be press&#8208;fit onto printed circuit boards and outperform metal heat sinks as a low&#8208;profile thermal management solution. This work offers a route for other all&#8208;ceramics that may be thermoformed through first fabricating pre&#8208;forms with highly&#8208;ordered anisotropic microstructures.

         <title>Biomimetic dendrite&#8208;free multivalent metal batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Rechargeable multivalent metal (e.g., zinc (Zn) and aluminum (Al)) batteries are ideal choices for large&#8208;scale energy storage owing to their intrinsic low cost and safety. However, the poor compatibility between metallic anodes and electrolytes strongly hampers their practical applications. Herein, we demonstrate that confining multivalent metals in a biomimetic scaffold (Bio&#8208;scaffold) can achieve highly efficient multivalent metal plating/stripping. This Bio&#8208;scaffold is well&#8208;tailored through the synergy of a parallel&#8208;aligned array of fractal copper branches and a CaTiO3 (CTO)&#8208;based coating layer. By virtue of this design strategy, the as&#8208;developed Bio&#8208;scaffold&#8208;based Zn and Al metal anodes exhibited dendrite&#8208;free morphologies with high reversibility and long lifespan, as well as excellent performance for Zn and Al full batteries. Theoretical modeling and experimental investigations reveal that the fractal copper array not only facilitates multivalent ion diffusion and electrolyte wetting, but also effectively reduces the local current densities during cycling; Meanwhile, the CTO&#8208;based coating layer effectively blocks interfacial side reactions and enables a homogeneous ionic flux. This work opens a new avenue for developing multivalent metal batteries.

         <title>Understanding H2 evolution electrochemistry to minimize solvated water impact on zinc anode performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
H2 evolution is the reason for poor reversibility and limited cycle stability with Zn metal anodes, and impedes practical application in aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIB). Here we demonstrate for the first time, using combined gas chromatography experiment and computation, that H2 evolution primarily originates from solvated water, rather than free water without interaction with Zn2+. We evidence, using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in salt electrolytes that H2 evolution occurs at a more negative potential than zinc reduction because of high overpotential against H2 evolution on Zn metal. We test our hypothesis and confirm, using glycine additive to reduce solvated water, that H2 evolution and &#8220;parasitic&#8221; side reactions are suppressed on the Zn anode. We evidence that this electrolyte additive suppresses H2 evolution, reduces corrosion and gives a uniform Zn deposition in Zn|Zn and Zn|Cu cells when compared with bare ZnSO4 electrolyte. We demonstrate Zn|PANI (highly conductive polyaniline) full cells exhibit boosted electrochemical performance in 1&#160;M ZnSO4&#8208;3&#160;M glycine electrolyte and, a high reversible capacity of 100 mAh g&#8722;1 in a practical Zn|PANI pouch cell. We conclude that this new understanding of electrochemistry of H2 evolution can be used for design of relatively low&#8208;cost and safe AZIB for practical large&#8208;scale energy storage. Findings will be of immediate benefit in electrolyte design for high performance rechargeable batteries and therefore of wide interest to researchers and manufacturers.

We conclude that this new understanding of electrochemistry of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution can be used for design of relatively low-cost and safe AZIB for practical large-scale energy storage. Findings will be of immediate benefit in electrolyte design for high performance rechargeable batteries and therefore of wide interest to researchers and manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Impact of Planar and Vertical Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors on Flexible Electronics</title>

Abstract
The development of flexible and conformable devices, whose performance can be maintained while being continuously deformed, provides a significant step towards the realization of next&#8208;generation wearable and e&#8208;textiles applications. Organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) are particularly interesting for flexible and lightweight products, because of their low&#8208;temperature solution processability, and the mechanical flexibility of organic materials that endows OFETs the natural compatibility with plastic and biodegradable substrates. Here, an in&#8208;depth review of two competing flexible OFET technologies, planar and vertical OFETs (POFETs and VOFETs, respectively) is provided. The electrical, mechanical, and physical properties of POFETs and VOFETs are critically discussed, with a focus on four pivotal applications (integrated logic circuits, light&#8208;emitting devices, memories, and sensors). It is pointed out that the flexible function of the relatively newer VOFET technology, along with its perspective on advancing the applicability of flexible POFETs, has not been reviewed so far, and the direct comparison regarding the performance of POFET&#8208; and VOFET&#8208;based flexible applications is most likely absent. With discussions spanning printed and wearable electronics, materials science, biotechnology, and environmental monitoring, this contribution is a clear stimulus to researchers working in these fields to engage towards the plentiful possibilities that POFETs and VOFETs offer to flexible electronics.

         <title>Antiferromagnetic Inverse Spin Hall Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) is one of the accessible and reliable methods to detect spin current. ISHE signals dependent on the N&#233;el vector in Mn2Au/[Co/Pd] are observed, and they are much stronger when the converted charge current is parallel to the N&#233;el vector compared with its orthogonal counterpart. The finding enriches the Hall effect family, and makes antiferromagnetic spintronics more flexible.








Abstract
The inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) is one of the accessible and reliable methods to detect spin current. The magnetization&#8208;dependent inverse spin Hall effect has been observed in magnets, expanding the dimension for spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion. However, antiferromagnetic N&#233;el&#8208;vector&#8208;dependent ISHE, which has been long time highly pursued, is still elusive. Here, ISHE in Mn2Au/[Co/Pd] heterostructures is investigated by terahertz emission and spin Seebeck effect measurements, where [Co/Pd] possesses perpendicular magnetic anisotropy for out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarized spin current generation and Mn2Au is a collinear antiferromagnet for the spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion. The out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin polarization (&#963;z) is rotated toward in&#8208;plane by the N&#233;el vectors in Mn2Au, then the spin current is converted into charge current at two staggered spin sublattices. The ISHE signal is much stronger when the converted charge current is parallel to the N&#233;el vector compared with its orthogonal counterpart. The N&#233;el vector and resultant ISHE signals, which is termed as antiferromagnetic inverse spin Hall effect, can be switched. The finding not only adds a new member to the Hall effect family, but also makes antiferromagnetic spintronics more flexible.

&lt;p&gt;The inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) is one of the accessible and reliable methods to detect spin current. The magnetization-dependent inverse spin Hall effect has been observed in magnets, expanding the dimension for spin-to-charge conversion. However, antiferromagnetic N&#233;el-vector-dependent ISHE, which has been long time highly pursued, is still elusive. Here, ISHE in Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Au/[Co/Pd] heterostructures is investigated by terahertz emission and spin Seebeck effect measurements, where [Co/Pd] possesses perpendicular magnetic anisotropy for out-of-plane polarized spin current generation and Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Au is a collinear antiferromagnet for the spin-to-charge conversion.

The ISHE signal is much stronger when the converted charge current is parallel to the N&#233;el vector compared with its orthogonal counterpart.

         <title>Spintronic Physical Unclonable Functions Based on Field&#8208;free Spin&#8208;orbit Torque Switching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Physically unclonable function (PUF) utilizes inherent random physical variations of solid&#8208;state devices and is a core ingredient of hardware security primitives. PUF promises more robust information security than that provided by the conventional software&#8208;based approaches. While silicon&#8208; and memristor&#8208;based PUFs are advancing, their reliability and scalability require further improvements. These are currently limited by output fluctuations and associated additional peripherals. Here, we demonstrate highly reliable spintronic PUFs that exploit field&#8208;free spin&#8208;orbit torque switching in IrMn/CoFeB/Ta/CoFeB structures. We show that the stochastic switching polarity of the perpendicular magnetization of the top CoFeB can be achieved by manipulating the exchange bias directions of the bottom IrMn/CoFeB. This serves as an entropy source for the spintronic PUF, which is characterized by high entropy, uniqueness, reconfigurability and digital output. Furthremore, our device ensures a zero bit&#8208;error&#8208;rate under repetitive operations and robustness against external magnetic fields, and offers scalable and energy&#8208;efficient device implementations.

         <title>A Universal Chemotactic Targeted Delivery Strategy for Inflammatory Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Above 50% of deaths can be attributed to chronic inflammatory diseases, thus the construction of drug delivery system based on effective interaction of inflammatory factors with chemotactic nanoparticles is meaningful. Herein, we propose a zwitterion&#8208;based artificial chemotactic nanomotor for universal precise targeting strategy in vivo, where the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in inflammatory sites are used as chemoattractants. And the multi&#8208;dimensional static models, dynamic models and in vivo models are established to evaluate chemotactic performance. Results show that the up&#8208;regulated ROS and iNOS can induce the chemotaxis of nanomotors to diseased tissues in inflammation&#8208;related disease models. Further, the mesoscale hydrodynamics simulations are performed to explain the chemotactic behavior of nanomotors. Such chemotactic delivery strategy is expected to improve the delivery efficiency and may be applicable to a variety of inflammatory diseases.

         <title>Nanomaterials Mediated Co&#8208;Stimulation of toll&#8208;like Receptors and CD40 for Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Toll&#8208;like Receptors (TLRs) and CD40 related&#8208;signaling pathways represent critical bridges between the innate and adaptive immune responses. Here, we develop an immunotherapy regimen that enables co&#8208;stimulation of TLR7/8 and CD40 mediated pathways. TLR7/8 agonist resiquimod (R848) derived amino lipids, RAL1 and RAL2, are synthesized and formulated into RAL&#8208;derived lipid nanoparticles (RAL&#8208;LNPs). The RAL2&#8208;LNPs show efficient CD40 mRNA delivery to DCs both in vitro (90.8 &#177; 2.7%) and in vivo (61.3 &#177; 16.4%). When combined with agonistic anti&#8208;CD40 antibody, this approach can produce effective antitumor activities in mouse melanoma tumor models, thereby suppressing tumor growth, prolonging mouse survival, and establishing antitumor memory immunity. Overall, RAL2&#8208;LNPs provide a novel platform towards cancer immunotherapy by integrating innate and adaptive immunity.

         <title>Approaching intrinsic threshold breakdown voltage and ultra&#8208;high gain in graphite/InSe Schottky photodetector</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Realizing both ultra&#8208;low breakdown voltage and ultra&#8208;high gain has been one of the major challenges in the development of high&#8208;performance avalanche photodetector. Here, we report that an ultra&#8208;high avalanche gain of 3 &#215; 105 can be realized in the graphite/InSe Schottky photodetector at a breakdown voltage down to 5.5 V. Remarkably, the threshold breakdown voltage can be further reduced down to 1.8 V by raising the operating temperature, approaching the theoretical limit of 1.5Eg${\mathcal{E}_g}$/e with Eg${\mathcal{E}_g}$ the band gap of semiconductor. We develop a two&#8208;dimensional impact ionization model and uncover that observation of high gain at low breakdown voltage arises from reduced dimensionality of electron&#8208;phonon (e&#8208;ph) scattering in the layered InSe flake. Our findings open up a promising avenue for developing novel weak&#8208;light detectors with low energy consumption and high sensitivity.

         <title>Electric&#8208;field&#8208;reinforced Hydrophobic Cationic Sieve Lowers the Concentration Threshold of Water&#8208;in&#8208;Salt Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
High&#8208;concentration Water&#8208;in&#8208;Salt (WIS) electrolytes expand the stable electrochemical window of aqueous electrolytes, leading to the advent of high&#8208;voltage (above 2&#160;V) aqueous Li&#8208;ion batteries (ALIBs). However, the high lithium salt concentration electrolytes of ALIBs results in their high cost and deteriorates kinetic performance. Therefore, it is challenging for ALIBs to explore aqueous electrolytes with appropriate concentration to balance the electrochemical window and kinetic performance as well as the cost. In contrast to maintaining high concentrations of aqueous electrolytes (&gt;20 m), we introduced a small number of hydrophobic cations to a much lower electrolyte concentration (13.8 m) and found that, compared with WIS electrolytes, ALIBs with these concentration&#8208;lowered electrolytes possess a compatible stable electrochemical window (3.23&#160;V) and achieve better kinetic performance. These findings originate from the added cations, which form an electric&#8208;field&#8208;reinforced hydrophobic cationic sieve (HCS) that blocks water away from the anode and suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction. Meanwhile, the lower electrolyte concentration provides significant benefits to ALIBs, including lower cost, better rate capability (lower viscosity of 18 cP and higher ionic conductivity of 22 mS/cm at 25 &#730;C), and improved low&#8208;temperature performance (liquidus temperature of &#8208;10.18 &#730;C).

         <title>Supramolecular Engineering of Amorphous Porous Polymers for Rapid Adsorption of Micro&#8208;pollutants and Solar&#8208;Powered Volatile Organic Compounds Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Freshwater shortage is becoming one of the most critical global challenges owing to severe water pollution caused by micropollutants and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). However, current purification technology shows slow adsorption of micropollutants and requires energy&#8208;intensive process for VOCs removal from water. In this study, a highly efficient molecularly engineered covalent triazine framework (CTF) for rapid adsorption of micropollutants and VOC&#8208;intercepting performance using solar distillation is reported. Supramolecular design and mild oxidation of CTFs (CTF&#8208;OXs) enable hydrophilic internal channels and improve molecular sieving of micropollutants. CTF&#8208;OX shows rapid removal efficiency of micropollutants (&gt; 99.9% in 10 s) and could be regenerated several times without performance loss. Uptake rates of selected micropollutants are high, with initial pollutant uptake rates of 21.9&#160;g mg&#8722;1 min&#8722;1, which are the highest rates recorded for bisphenol A (BPA) adsorption. Additionally, photothermal composite membrane fabrication using CTF&#8208;OX exhibits high VOC rejection rate (up to 98%) under 1 sun irradiation (1&#160;kW m&#8722;2). A prototype of synergistic purification system composed of adsorption and solar&#8208;driven membrane can efficiently remove over 99.9% of mixed phenol derivatives. This study provides an effective strategy for rapid removal of micropollutants and high VOC rejection via solar&#8208;driven evaporation process.

         <dc:description>
Abstract
As an essential micronutrient, manganese (Mn) participates in various physiological processes, and plays important roles in host immune system, hematopoiesis, endocrine function, and oxidative stress regulation. Mn&#8208;based nanoparticles are considered to be biocompatible and shown versatile applications in nanomedicine, in particular utilized in tumor immunotherapy in the following ways: (1) acting as a biocompatible nanocarrier to deliver immunotherapeutic agents for tumor immunotherapy; (2) serving as an adjuvant to regulate tumor immune microenvironment and enhance immunotherapy; (3) activating host's immune system through the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway to trigger tumor immunotherapy; (4) real&#8208;time monitoring tumor immunotherapy effect by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) since Mn2+ ions are ideal MRI contrast agent which can significantly enhance the T1&#8208;weighted MRI signal after binding to proteins. This comprehensive review focuses on the most recent progress of Mn&#8208;based nanoplatforms in tumor immunotherapy. The characteristics of Mn are first discussed to guide the design of Mn&#8208;based multifunctional nanoplatforms. Then the biomedical applications of Mn&#8208;based nanoplatforms, including immunotherapy alone, immunotherapy&#8208;involved multimodal synergistic therapy, and imaging&#8208;guided immunotherapy are discussed in detail. Finally, the challenges and future developments of Mn&#8208;based tumor immunotherapy are highlighted.

         <title>Polaritons in van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) monolayers supporting a wide variety of highly confined plasmons, phonon polaritons, and exciton polaritons can be vertically stacked in vdWHs with controlled constituent layers, stacking sequence, and even twist angles. Van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) combine advantages of 2D material polaritons, rich optical structure design and atomic scale integration, which have greatly extended the performance and functions of polaritons, such as wide frequency range, long lifetime, ultrafast all&#8208;optical modulation, and photonic crystals for nanoscale light. Here, we review the state of the art of 2D material polaritons in vdWHs from the perspective of design principles and potential applications. We start by discussing some fundamental properties of polaritons in vdWHs, and then cover recent discoveries of plasmons, phonon polaritons, exciton polaritons and their hybrid modes in vdWHs, respectively. We conclude with a perspective discussion on potential applications of these polaritons such as nanophotonic integrated circuits, which will benefit from the intersection between nanophotonics and materials science.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Sb Rhombohedron with Unconventional Rhombohedral Phase as Trifunctional Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Crystal phase engineering is an important strategy for designing noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts with optimized activity and stability. From the thermodynamic point of view, it remains a great challenge to synthesize unconventional phases of noble metals. Here, a new class of Pd&#8208;based nanostructure with unconventional rhombohedral Pd20Sb7 phase has been successfully synthesized. Benefiting from the high proportion of the unique exposed Pd20Sb7 (003) surface, Pd20Sb7 rhombohedra display much enhanced ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance compared with commercial Pd/C. Moreover, Pd20Sb7 rhombohedra are also demonstrated as effective air cathode in non&#8208;aqueous Li&#8211;air battery with an overpotential of only 0.24&#160;V. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the unique exposed facets of Pd20Sb7 rhombohedra can not only reduce the excessive adsorption of CH3CO* to CH3COOH on Pd for promoting EOR process, but also weaken the CO binding and CO poisoning. This work provides a new class of unconventional intermetallic nanomaterials with enhanced electrocatalytic activity.

Moreover, Pd&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; rhombohedra are also demonstrated as effective air cathode in non-aqueous Li&#8211;air battery with an overpotential of only 0.24&#160;V. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the unique exposed facets of Pd&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; rhombohedra can not only reduce the excessive adsorption of CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO* to CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH on Pd for promoting EOR process, but also weaken the CO binding and CO poisoning. This work provides a new class of unconventional intermetallic nanomaterials with enhanced electrocatalytic activity.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Ru doping Induced Spin Frustration and Enhancement of the Room&#8208;temperature Anomalous Hall effect in La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
In transition&#8208;metal&#8208;oxide heterostructures, the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is a powerful tool for detecting the magnetic state and revealing intriguing interfacial magnetic orderings. However, achieving a larger AHE at room temperature in oxide heterostructures is still challenging due to the dilemma of mutually strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling and magnetic exchange interactions. Here, we exploit the Ru doping&#8208;enhanced AHE in La2/3Sr1/3Mn1&#8208;xRuxO3 epitaxial films. As the B&#8208;site Ru doping level increases up to 20%, the anomalous Hall resistivity at room temperature can be enhanced from n&#937;&#8729;cm to &#956;&#937;&#8729;cm scale. Ru doping leads to strong competition between ferromagnetic double&#8208;exchange interaction and antiferromagnetic super&#8208;exchange interaction. The resultant spin frustration and spin&#8208;glass state facilitate a strong skew&#8208;scattering process, thus significantly enhancing the extrinsic AHE. Our findings could pave a feasible approach for boosting the controllability and reliability of oxide&#8208;based spintronic devices.

         <title>Optical Memory, Switching, and Neuromorphic Functionality in Metal Halide Perovskite Materials and Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal halide perovskite&#8208;based materials have emerged over the past few decades as remarkable solution&#8208;processable opto&#8208;electronic materials with many intriguing properties and potential applications. These emerging materials have recently been considered for their promise in low&#8208;energy memory and information processing applications. In particular, their large optical cross&#8208;sections, high photoconductance contrast, large carrier diffusion lengths, and mixed electronic/ionic transport mechanisms are attractive for enabling memory elements and neuromorphic devices that are written and/or read in the optical domain. Here, we review recent progress towards memory and neuromorphic functionality in metal halide perovskite materials and devices where photons are used as a critical degree of freedom for switching, memory, and neuromorphic functionality.

         <title>Janus Helical Ribbon Structure of Ordered Nanowire Films for Flexible Solar Thermoelectric Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solar thermoelectric devices play a significant role in handling the global warming problem, owing to its unique feature of converting both waste heat and solar energy directly into electricity. Herein, we design a flexible three&#8208;dimensional Janus helical&#160;ribbon architecture starting from well&#8208;aligned tellurium (Te) nanowire film, using an in&#8208;situ redox process reacting with Ag+ and Cu2+ resulting in the n&#8208;type, p&#8208;type, and photothermal sides in one film. Remarkably, the device shows all&#8208;day electricity generation and large temperature gradient by coupling cold side with passive radiative cooling technique and hot side with selective solar absorption technique, showing a temperature gradient of 29.5 K which is much higher than previously reported devices under low solar radiation of only 614&#160;W m&#8722;2. Interestingly, the device can still generate electricity even at night. The present designed strategy offers a new way for heat management by efficiently utilizing solar energy and the cold of the universe.

         <title>Observation of H2 Evolution and Electrolyte Diffusion on MoS2 Monolayer by in situ Liquid&#8208;phase Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Unit cell&#8208;thick MoS2 is a promising electrocatalyst for a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) owing to its tunable catalytic activity, which has been determined based on the energetics and molecular interactions of different types of HER active sites. Kinetic responses of MoS2 active sites, including the reaction onset, diffusion of the electrolyte and H2 bubbles, and continuation of these processes, are important factors affecting the catalytic activity of MoS2. Investigating these factors requires a direct real&#8208;time analysis of the HER occurring on spatially independent active sites. Herein, the H2 evolution and electrolyte diffusion on the MoS2 surface are observed in real time by in situ electrochemical liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy (LPTEM). Time&#8208;dependent LPTEM observations reveal that different types of active sites are sequentially activated under the same conditions. Furthermore, the electrolyte flow to these sites is influenced by the reduction potential and site geometry, which affects the bubble detachment and overall HER activity of MoS2.

         <title>Rapid Regeneration of A Neoartery with Elastic Lamellae</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Native arteries contain a distinctive intima&#8208;media comprised of organized elastin and an adventitia containing mature collagen fibrils. In contrast, implanted biodegradable small&#8208;diameter vascular grafts do not present spatially regenerated, organized elastin. The elastin&#8208;containing structures within the intima&#8208;media region encompass the elastic lamellae (EL) and internal elastic lamina (IEL) and are crucial for normal arterial function. Here, we describe the development of a novel electrospun small&#8208;diameter vascular graft that facilitates de novo formation of a structurally appropriate elastin&#8208;containing intima&#8208;media region following implantation. The graft comprise a non&#8208;porous microstructure characterized by tropoelastin fibers that are embedded in a PGS matrix. After implantation in mouse abdominal aorta, the graft develops distinct cell and extracellular matrix profiles that approximate the native adventitia and intima&#8208;media by 8 weeks. Within the newly formed intima&#8208;media region there are circumferentially aligned smooth muscle cell layers that alternate with multiple EL similar to that found in the arterial wall. By 8 months, the developed adventitia region contains mature collagen fibrils and the neoartery presents a distinct IEL with thickness comparable to that in mouse abdominal aorta. We propose that this new class of material can generate the critically required, organized elastin needed for arterial regeneration.

Here, the latest progress in imaging&#8208;guided nanosystem&#8208;based biomaterials for real&#8208;time monitoring of immune cells and immune signaling molecules is summarized to predict the efficacy of immunotherapy, and future directions and main challenges for the visualization of response rates are also discussed.








Abstract
Immunotherapy is one of the most promising clinical modalities for the treatment of malignant tumors and has shown excellent therapeutic outcomes in clinical settings. However, it continues to face several challenges, including long treatment cycles, high costs, immune&#8208;related adverse events, and low response rates. Thus, it is critical to predict the response rate to immunotherapy by using imaging technology in the preoperative and intraoperative. Here, the latest advances in nanosystem&#8208;based biomaterials used for predicting responses to immunotherapy via the imaging of immune cells and signaling molecules in the immune microenvironment are comprehensively summarized. Several imaging methods, such as fluorescence imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography imaging, ultrasound imaging, and photoacoustic imaging, used in immune predictive imaging, are discussed to show the potential of nanosystems for distinguishing immunotherapy responders from nonresponders. Nanosystem&#8208;based biomaterials aided by various imaging technologies are expected to enable the effective prediction and diagnosis in cases of tumors, inflammation, and other public diseases.

         <title>Heterogeneous&#8208;Interface&#8208;Enhanced Adsorption of Organic and Hydroxyl for Biomass Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CuO&#8211;PdO heterogeneous interface, which exhibits a low onset potential of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction and high current density, is successfully synthesized. The analytical results show that the CuO&#8211;PdO heterogeneous interface can strengthen the adsorption and activation capacity of organic molecules and OH&#8722; species, and promote the dehydrogenation and electron transfer in the process of 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid&#8594;2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) provides an efficient way to obtain high&#8208;value&#8208;added biomass&#8208;derived chemicals.&#160;Compared with other transition metal oxides, CuO exhibits poor oxygen evolution reaction performance, leading to high Faraday efficiency for HMF oxidation.&#160;However, the weak adsorption and activation ability of CuO to OH&#8722; species restricts its further development. Herein, the CuO&#8211;PdO heterogeneous interface is successfully constructed, resulting in an advanced onset&#8208;potential of the HMF oxidation reaction (HMFOR), a higher current density than CuO. The results of open&#8208;circuit potential, in&#160;situ infrared spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations indicate that the introduction of PdO enhances the adsorption capacity of the organic molecule.&#160;Meanwhile, the CuO&#8211;PdO heterogeneous interface promotes the adsorption and activation of OH&#8722; species, as demonstrated by zeta potential and electrochemical measurements. This work elucidates the adsorption enhancement mechanism of heterogeneous interfaces and provides constructive guidance for designing efficient multicomponent electrocatalysts in organic electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Exceptionally High Saturation Magnetic Flux Density and Ultralow Coercivity via an Amorphous&#8211;Nanocrystalline Transitional Microstructure in an FeCo&#8208;Based Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative compositional design concept enables the construction of a unique transitional microstructure between traditional amorphous and nanocrystalline alloys, which results in an alloy with an unprecedented combination of exceptionally high saturation magnetic flux density (Bs&#160;= 1.94 T) and ultralow coercivity (Hc&#160;= 4.3 A m&#8722;1), breaking the general trade&#8208;off between Bs and Hc in the soft&#8208;magnetic&#8208;material family.








Abstract
High saturation magnetic flux density (Bs) of soft magnetic materials is essential for increasing the power density of modern magnetic devices and motor machines. Yet, increasing Bs is always at the expense of high coercivity (Hc), presenting a general trade&#8208;off in the soft magnetic material family. Here, superior comprehensive soft magnetic properties, i.e., an exceptionally high Bs of up to 1.94 T and Hc as low as 4.3 A m&#8722;1 are unprecedentedly combined in an FeCo&#8208;based alloy. This alloy is obtained through a composition design strategy to construct a transitional microstructure between amorphous and traditional nanocrystalline alloys, with nanocrystals (with &lt; 5 nm&#8208;sized crystal&#8208;like regions around) sparsely dispersed in an amorphous matrix. Such transitional microstructure possesses extremely low magnetic anisotropy caused by the annihilation of quasi&#8208;dislocation dipoles, and a strong magnetic exchange interaction, which leads to excellent comprehensive magnetic properties. The results provide useful guidelines for the development of the next generation of soft magnetic materials, which are promising for applications of high&#8208;frequency, high&#8208;efficiency, and energy&#8208;saving devices.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Transitional Bismuth&#8208;Based Metals enable Rapid Embolotherapy, Hyperthermia, and Biomedical Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional bismuth&#8208;based liquid embolic agent with rapid liquid&#8211;solid phase transition is proposed for administrating simultaneous embolotherapy, hyperthermia, and biomedical imaging. This high&#8208;image&#8208;contrast material is demonstrated with fast embolization of arteriovenous vessels and tumor nutrient supply vessels and enhanced treatment efficacy via combination with hyperthermia, which holds big promises in future embolism and theranostic platform.








Abstract
Embolization has been an important minimally invasive therapy for occlusion of malfunctioned vasculature and tumor treatment via target delivering embolic agents. The limitation of conventional embolic agents, such as fabrication process, precipitation time, invisibility, and lack of integrated functions often leads to insufficient embolization efficacy. To overcome these drawbacks, a multifunctional bismuth (Bi)&#8208;based liquid embolic agent for simultaneous realization of embolotherapy, thermotherapy, as well as high&#8208;contrast biomedical imaging is proposed. Benefitting from the suitable melting point, flexible nature, metallic merit, and easygoing operation via injection, the versatile embolic agent can achieve rapid liquid&#8211;solid phase transition, magnetic hyperthermia, and multimodal imaging capability. The Bi&#8208;based materials are demonstrated with excellent arteriovenous embolization efficiency and favorable biocompatibility according to in vivo investigations. Introduction of the liquid embolic agent to tumor arteries achieves evident tumor regression and rather clear imaging under computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging&#160;(MRI), and thermographs for consistently tracking the implants over the biological body. Further, the combined therapy coupled with thermotherapy exhibits improved therapeutic efficiency with formation of necrosis and total tumor eradiation at day 15&#160;after the treatment. The present innovative embolic agent and the surgical principle provide a promising modality for embolization and potential theranostic platform of tumors.

         <title>Self&#8208;healing of Prussian Blue Analogues with Electrochemically Driven Morphological Rejuvenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Maintaining the morphology of electrode materials with high invertibility contributes to the prolonged cyclic stability of battery systems. However, the majority of electrode materials tend to degrade during the charge&#8208;discharge process owing to the inevitable increase in entropy. Herein, we designed a self&#8208;healing strategy to promote morphology rejuvenation in Prussian blue analogue (PBA) cathodes by cobalt doping. Experimental characterisation and theoretical calculations demonstrated that a trace amount of cobalt could decelerate the crystallisation process and restore the cracked areas to ensure perfect cubic structures of PBA cathodes. The electric field controlled the kinetic dynamics, rather than the conventional thermodynamics, to realise the &#8220;electrochemically driven dissolution&#8211;recrystallisation process&#8221; for the periodic self&#8208;healing phenomenon. The properties of electron transportation and ion diffusion in bulk PBA were also improved by the doping strategy, thus boosting the cyclability with 4000 cycles in a diluent electrolyte. This discovery provides a new paradigm for the construction of self&#8208;healing electrodes for cathodes.

         <title>Structure/Interface Coupling Effect for High&#8208;Voltage LiCoO2 Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;modified LCO, which couples pillar structures with interface shielding, is successfully synthesized for achieving a high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and structurally stable cathode material. The as&#8208;designed CB&#8208;Mg&#8208;LCO cathode achieves a high capacity and excellent cycle stability with 94.6% capacity retention at an extremely high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6 V.








Abstract
LiCoO2 (LCO) is widely applied in today's rechargeable battery markets for consumer electronic devices. However, LCO operations at high voltage are hindered by accelerated structure degradation and electrode/electrolyte interface decomposition. To overcome these challenges, co&#8208;modified LCO (defined as CB&#8208;Mg&#8208;LCO)&#160;that couples pillar structures with interface shielding are successfully synthesized for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and structurally stable cathode material. Benefitting from the &#8220;Mg&#8208;pillar&#8221; effect, irreversible phase transitions are significantly suppressed and highly reversible Li+ shuttling is enabled. Interestingly, bonding effects between the interfacial lattice oxygen of CB&#8208;Mg&#8208;LCO and amorphous CoxBy coating layer are found to elevate the formation energy of oxygen vacancies, thereby considerably mitigating lattice oxygen loss and inhibiting irreversible phase transformation. Meanwhile, interface shielding effects are also beneficial for mitigating parasitic electrode/electrolyte reactions, subsequent Co dissolution, and ultimately enable a robust electrode/electrolyte interface. As a result, the as&#8208;designed CB&#8208;Mg&#8208;LCO cathode achieves a high capacity and excellent cycle stability with 94.6% capacity retention at an extremely high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6&#160;V. These findings provide new insights for cathode material modification methods, which serves to guide future cathode material design.

         <title>Polarisation Topology at the Nominally Charged Domain Walls in Uniaxial Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ferroelectric domain walls provide a fertile environment for novel materials physics. If a polarisation discontinuity arises, it can drive a redistribution of electronic carriers and changes in band structure, which often result in emergent two&#8208;dimensional conductivity. If such a discontinuity is not tolerated, then its amelioration usually involves the formation of complex topological patterns, such as flux&#8208;closure domains, dipolar vortices, skyrmions, merons or Hopfions. The degrees of freedom required for the development of such patterns, in which dipolar rotation is a hall mark, are readily found in multiaxial ferroelectrics. In uniaxial ferroelectrics, where only two opposite polar orientations are possible, it has been assumed that discontinuities are unavoidable when antiparallel components of polarisation meet. This perception has been borne out by the appearance of charged conducting domain walls in systems such as hexagonal manganites and lithium niobate. Here, experimental and theoretical investigations on lead germanate (Pb5Ge3O11) reveal that polar discontinuities can be obviated at head&#8208;to&#8208;head and tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail domain walls by mutual domain bifurcation along two different axes, creating a characteristic saddle&#8208;point domain wall morphology and associated novel dipolar topology, removing the need for screening charge accumulation and associated conductivity enhancement.

         <title>Time&#8208;division Position Sensitive Detector Image System for High&#8208;speed Multitarget Trajectory Tracking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High&#8208;speed trajectory tracking with real&#8208;time processing capability is particularly important in the fields of pilotless automobiles, guidance systems, robotics, and filmmaking. The conventional optical approach to high&#8208;speed trajectory tracking involves CCD or CMOS image sensors, which suffer from trade&#8208;offs between resolution and framerates, complexity of the system, and enormous data analysis processes. Here, we design a high&#8208;speed trajectory tracking system by using a time&#8208;division position sensitive detector (TD&#8208;PSD) based on a graphene&#8208;silicon Schottky heterojunction. Benefiting from the high&#8208;speed optoelectronic response and submicrometer positional accuracy of the TD&#8208;PSD, multitarget real&#8208;time trajectory tracking is realized, with a maximum image output framerate of up to 62000 frames per second. Moreover, multichannel trajectory tracking and image distortion correction functionalities are realized by TD&#8208;PSD systems through frequency&#8208;related image preprocessing, which significantly improves the capacity of real&#8208;time information processing and image quality in complicated light environments.

         <title>Magnetic Ordering in a High&#8208;Spin Donor&#8211;Acceptor Conjugated Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The development of open&#8208;shell organic molecules that magnetically order at room temperature and which can be practically applied remains a grand challenge in chemistry, physics, and materials science. Despite the exploration of a vast chemical space, design paradigms for organic paramagnetic centers generally result in unpaired electron spins that are unstable or isotropic. Here, we demonstrate a high&#8208;spin conjugated polymer, comprised of alternating cyclopentadithiophene and benzo[1,2&#8208;c;4,5&#8208;c&#8242;]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole heterocycles, in which macromolecular structure and topology coalesce to promote spin center generation and intermolecular exchange coupling. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy is consistent with spatially localized spins, while magnetic susceptibility measurements show clear anisotropic spin ordering and exchange interactions that persist at room temperature. The application of long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;correlations for spin center generation promotes remarkable stability. This work offers a fundamentally new approach to the implementation of this long sought&#8208;after physical phenomenon within organic materials and the integration of manifold properties within emerging technologies.

         <title>Magnetic Skyrmions with Unconventional Helicity Polarization in a Van Der Waals Ferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic skyrmions with unconventional helicity polarization are observed in a van der Waals ferromagnet Fe5&#8722;&#948;GeTe2. The helicity of the dipole skyrmions in Fe5&#8722;&#948;GeTe2 is polarized, namely, the &#960;/2 and &#8722;&#960;/2 helicities are not equally populated. The short&#8208;range order of Fe split sites results in a localized Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction contribution, which breaks the degeneracy of the opposite helicities.








Abstract
Skyrmion helicity, which defines the spin swirling direction, is a fundamental parameter that may be utilized to encode data bits in future memory devices. Generally, in centrosymmetric ferromagnets, dipole skyrmions with helicity of &#8722;&#960;/2 and &#960;/2 are degenerate in energy, leading to equal populations of both helicities. On the other hand, in chiral materials where the Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction (DMI) prevails and the dipolar interaction is negligible, only a preferred helicity is selected by the type of DMI. However, whether there is a rigid boundary between these two regimes remains an open question. Herein, the observation of dipole skyrmions with unconventional helicity polarization in a van der Waals ferromagnet, Fe5&#8722;&#948;GeTe2, is reported. Combining magnetometry, Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, electrical transport measurements, and micromagnetic simulations, the short&#8208;range superstructures in Fe5&#8722;&#948;GeTe2 resulting in a localized DMI contribution, which breaks the degeneracy of the opposite helicities and leads to the helicity polarization, is demonstrated. Therefore, the helicity feature in Fe5&#8722;&#948;GeTe2 is controlled by both the dipolar interaction and DMI that the former leads to Bloch&#8208;type skyrmions with helicity of &#177;&#960;/2 whereas the latter breaks the helicity degeneracy. This work provides new insights into the skyrmion topology in van der Waals materials.

         <title>Simultaneously Enhancing Exciton/Charge Transport in Organic Solar Cells by an Organoboron Additive</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exciton diffusion and charge transport of PM6:Y6&#8208;based organic solar cells are simultaneously enhanced by trans&#8208;bis(dimesitylboron)stilbene (BBS), and the PM6:Y6:BBS devices achieve a higher efficiency of 17.6% relative to that without BBS (16.2%).








Abstract
Efficient exciton diffusion and charge transport play a vital role in advancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). Here, a facile strategy is presented to simultaneously enhance exciton/charge transport of the widely studied PM6:Y6&#8208;based OSCs by employing highly emissive trans&#8208;bis(dimesitylboron)stilbene (BBS) as a solid additive. BBS transforms the emissive sites from a more H&#8208;type aggregate into a more J&#8208;type aggregate, which benefits the resonance energy transfer for PM6 exciton diffusion and energy transfer from PM6 to Y6. Transient gated photoluminescence spectroscopy measurements indicate that addition of BBS improves the exciton diffusion coefficient of PM6 and the dissociation of PM6 excitons in the PM6:Y6:BBS film. Transient absorption spectroscopy measurements confirm faster charge generation in PM6:Y6:BBS. Moreover, BBS helps improve Y6 crystallization, and current&#8208;sensing atomic force microscopy characterization reveals an improved charge&#8208;carrier diffusion length in PM6:Y6:BBS. Owing to the enhanced exciton diffusion, exciton dissociation, charge generation, and charge transport, as well as reduced charge recombination and energy loss, a higher PCE of 17.6% with simultaneously improved open&#8208;circuit voltage, short&#8208;circuit current density, and fill factor is achieved for the PM6:Y6:BBS devices compared to the devices without BBS (16.2%).

         <title>Observation of Coexisting Dirac Bands and Moir&#233; Flat Bands in Magic&#8208;Angle Twisted Trilayer Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magic&#8208;angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG) hosts robust superconductivity with unique properties, including the Pauli&#8208;limit violating and re&#8208;entrant behaviors. A systematic investigation combining nanometer&#8208;scale spatially resolved angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy on MATTG revealing the coexistence of the Dirac band and the moir&#233; flat band serves as a stepstone for further understanding of the unconventional superconductivity in MATTG.








Abstract
Moir&#233; superlattices that consist of two or more layers of 2D materials stacked together with a small twist angle have emerged as a tunable platform to realize various correlated and topological phases, such as Mott insulators, unconventional superconductivity, and quantum anomalous Hall effect. Recently, magic&#8208;angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG) has shown both robust superconductivity similar to magic&#8208;angle twisted bilayer graphene and other unique properties, including the Pauli&#8208;limit violating and re&#8208;entrant superconductivity. These rich properties are deeply rooted in its electronic structure under the influence of distinct moir&#233; potential and mirror symmetry. Here, combining nanometer&#8208;scale spatially resolved angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, the as&#8208;yet unexplored band structure of MATTG near charge neutrality is systematically measured. These measurements reveal the coexistence of the distinct dispersive Dirac band with the emergent moir&#233; flat band, showing nice agreement with the theoretical calculations. These results serve as a stepstone for further understanding of the unconventional superconductivity in MATTG.

         <title>Synthetic Nanoarchitectonics of Functional Organic&#8211;Inorganic 2D Germanane Heterostructures via Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Succeeding graphene, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) inorganic materials made of reactive van der Waals layers, like 2D Germanane (2D&#8208;Ge) derivatives, have attracted great attention because their physicochemical characteristics can be entirely tuned by modulating the nature of the surface substituent. Although very interesting from a scientific point of view, almost all the reported works involving 2D&#8208;Ge derivatives are focused on computational studies. Herein, a first prototype of organic&#8211;inorganic 2D&#8208;Ge heterostructure has been synthesized by covalently anchoring thiol&#8208;rich carbon dots (CD&#8211;SH) onto 2D allyl Germanane (2D&#8208;aGe) via a simple and green &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; click chemistry approach. Remarkably, the implanted characteristics of the carbon nanomaterial provide new physicochemical features to the resulting 0D/2D heterostructure, making possible its implementation in yet unexplored optoelectronic tasks&#8212;e.g., as a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensing system triggered by supramolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions&#8212;that are inaccessible for the pristine 2D&#8208;aGe counterpart. Consequently, this work builds a foundation toward the robust achievement of functional organic&#8211;inorganic 2D&#8208;Ge nanoarchitectonics through covalently assembling thiol&#8208;rich carbon nanoallotropes on commercially available 2D&#8208;aGe.

Abstract
Small&#8208;scale robots (SSRs) have emerged as promising and versatile tools in various biomedical, sensing, decontamination, and manipulation applications, as they are uniquely capable of performing tasks at small length scales. With the miniaturization of robots from the macroscale to millimeter&#8208;, micrometer&#8208;, and nanometer&#8208;scales, the viscous and surface forces, namely adhesive forces and surface tension have become dominant. These forces significantly impact motion efficiency. Surface engineering of robots with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic functionalization presents a brand&#8208;new pathway to overcome motion resistance and enhance the ability to target and regulate robots for various tasks. This review focuses on the current progress and future perspectives of SSRs with hydrophilic and hydrophobic modifications (including both tethered and untethered robots). The study emphasizes the distinct advantages of SSRs, such as improved maneuverability and reduced drag forces, and outlines their potential applications. With continued innovation, rational surface engineering is expected to endow SSRs with exceptional mobility and functionality, which can broaden their applications, enhance their penetration depth, reduce surface fouling, and inhibit bacterial adhesion.

         <dc:description>
Abstract
Inorganic two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials offer a new approach to control mass diffusion at the nanoscale. Controlling ion transport in nanofluidics is key to energy conversion, energy storage, water purification, and numerous other applications wherein persistent challenges for efficient separation must be addressed. We herein discuss the recent development of 2D membranes in the emerging field of energy harvesting, water desalination, and proton/Li&#8208;ion production in the context of green energy and environmental technology. We highlight the fundamental mechanisms, 2D membrane fabrication, and challenges toward practical applications. Finally, we outline the fundamental issues of thermodynamics and kinetics along with potential membrane designs that must be resolved to bridge the gap between lab&#8208;scale experiments and production levels.

         <title>Multispectral Large&#8208;Panel X&#8208;ray Imaging Enabled by Stacked Metal Halide Scintillators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An entirely new strategy to obtain multispectral large&#8208;area X&#8208;ray imaging by stacked metal halide scintillators is proposed. Dual and four&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray imaging are achieved, respectively, by two&#8208; and four&#8208;layer stacked scintillators based on a low&#8208;cost and scalable approach. Details that are not observable in conventional energy&#8208;integration X&#8208;ray imaging are clearly shown.








Abstract
Conventional energy&#8208;integration black&#8211;white X&#8208;ray imaging lacks the spectral information of X&#8208;ray photons. Although X&#8208;ray spectra (energy) can be distinguished by the photon&#8208;counting technique typically with CdZnTe detectors, it is very challenging to be applied to large&#8208;area flat&#8208;panel X&#8208;ray imaging (FPXI). Herein, multilayer stacked scintillators of different X&#8208;ray absorption capabilities and scintillation spectra are designed; in this scenario, the X&#8208;ray energy can be discriminated by detecting the emission spectra of each scintillator; therefore, multispectral X&#8208;ray imaging can be easily obtained by color or multispectral visible&#8208;light camera in a single shot of X&#8208;rays. To verify this idea, stacked multilayer scintillators based on several emerging metal halides are fabricated in a cost&#8208;effective and scalable solution process, and proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept multispectral (or multi&#8208;energy) FPXI are experimentally demonstrated. The dual&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray image of a &#8220;bone&#8211;muscle&#8221; model clearly shows the details that are invisible in conventional energy&#8208;integration FPXI. By stacking four layers of specifically designed multilayer scintillators with appropriate thicknesses, a prototype FPXI with four energy channels is realized, proving its extendibility to multispectral or even hyperspectral X&#8208;ray imaging. This study provides a facile and effective strategy to realize multispectral large&#8208;area flat&#8208;panel X&#8208;ray imaging.

         <title>Potassium&#8208;Assisted Fabrication of Intrinsic Defects in Porous Carbons for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A K+&#8208;assisted synthetic strategy is developed to afford porous carbon (K&#8208;defect&#8208;C&#8208;1100) with abundant 12&#8208;vacancy&#8208;type (V12) carbon defects via direct pyrolysis of a K+&#8208;confined metal&#8211;organic framework (K+@bio&#8208;MOF&#8208;1) at 1100 &#176;C. Strikingly, the K&#8208;defect&#8208;C&#8208;1100 presents excellent electrocatalytic CO2 reduction activity with ultrahigh CO Faradic efficiency up to 99% at &#8722;0.45 V, far surpassing the N&#8208;doped carbon (N&#8208;C&#8208;1100) counterpart.








Abstract
The fabrication of intrinsic carbon defects is usually tangled with doping effects, and the identification of their unique roles in catalysis remains a tough task. Herein, a K+&#8208;assisted synthetic strategy is developed to afford porous carbon (K&#8208;defect&#8208;C) with abundant intrinsic defects and complete elimination of heteroatom via direct pyrolysis of K+&#8208;confined metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Positron&#8208;annihilation lifetime spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure measurement, and scanning transmission electron microscopy jointly illustrate the existence of abundant 12&#8208;vacancy&#8208;type carbon defects (V12) in K&#8208;defect&#8208;C. Remarkably, the K&#8208;defect&#8208;C achieves ultrahigh CO Faradaic efficiency (99%) at &#8722;0.45&#160;V in CO2 electroreduction, far surpassing MOF&#8208;derived carbon without K+ etching. Theoretical calculations reveal that the V12 defects in K&#8208;defect&#8208;C favor CO2 adsorption and significantly accelerate the formation of the rate&#8208;determining COOH* intermediate, thereby promoting CO2 reduction. This work develops a novel strategy to generate intrinsic carbon defects and provides new insights into their critical role in catalysis.

         <title>Engineering 3d&#8211;2p&#8211;4f Gradient Orbital Coupling to Enhance Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and feasible gradient orbital coupling strategy is proposed for tuning the oxygen reduction reaction performance through the construction of Co 3d&#8208;O 2p&#8208;Eu 4f unit sites on Eu2O3&#8211;Co model. This strategy&#160;optimizes the eg occupancy of Co sites, and weakens the O&#63742;O bond, and ultimately breaks the scaling relation between *OOH and *OH at Co&#8211;O&#8211;Eu unit sites.








Abstract
The development of highly efficient and economical materials for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) plays a key role in practical energy conversion technologies. However, the intrinsic scaling relations exert thermodynamic inhibition on realizing highly active ORR electrocatalysts. Herein, a novel and feasible gradient orbital coupling strategy for tuning the ORR performance through the construction of Co 3d&#8208;O 2p&#8208;Eu 4f unit sites on the Eu2O3&#8211;Co model is proposed. Through the gradient orbital coupling, the pristine ionic property between Eu and O atoms is assigned with increased covalency, which optimizes the eg occupancy of Co sites, and weakens the O&#63742;O bond, thus ultimately breaking the scaling relation between *OOH and *OH at Co&#8211;O&#8211;Eu unit sites. The optimized model catalyst displays onset and half&#8208;wave potential of 1.007 and 0.887&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, respectively, which are higher than those of commercial Pt/C and most Co&#8208;based catalysts ever reported. In addition, the catalyst is found to possess superior selectivity and durability. It also reveals better cell performance than commercial noble&#8208;metal catalysts in Zn&#8211;air batteries in terms of high power/energy densities and long cycle life. This study provides a new perspective for electronic modulation strategy by the construction of gradient 3d&#8211;2p&#8211;4f orbital coupling.

         <title>Metasurface Enabled On&#8208;Chip Generation and Manipulation of Vector Beams from Vertical Cavity Surface&#8208;Emitting Lasers</title>

Abstract
Metasurface polarization optics that consist of two&#8208;dimensional array of birefringent nano&#8208;antennas have proven remarkable capabilities to generate and manipulate vectorial fields with subwavelength resolution and high efficiency. Integrating this new type of metasurface with the standard VCSEL platform enables an ultracompact and powerful solution to control both phase and polarization properties of the laser on a chip, which allows to structure a VCSEL into vector beams with on&#8208;demand wavefronts. Here, we demonstrate this concept by directly generating versatile vector beams from commercially available VCSELs through on&#8208;chip integration of high&#8208;index dielectric metasurfaces. Experimentally, the versatility of our approach for the development of vectorial VCSELs are validated by implementing a variety of functionalities, including directional emission of multibeam with specified polarizations, vectorial holographic display, and vector vortex beams generations. Notably, the proposed vectorial VCSELs integrated with a single layer of beam shaping metasurface bypass the requirements of multiple cascaded optical components, and thus have the potential to promote the advancements of ultracompact, lightweight, and scalable vector beams sources, enriching and expanding the applications of VCSELs in optical communications, laser manipulation and processing, information encryption, and quantum optics.

         <title>Biomimetic Bacteriophage&#8208;Like Particles Formed from Probiotic Extracts and NO Donors for Eradicating Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Staphylococcus aureus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Effectively clearing multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria through non&#8208;antibiotic treatments is crucial for the recovery of infected tissues in favorable biological environments. Herein, a thermally responsive donor of cell&#8208;messenger nitric oxide (NO) was combined with extracts of food&#8208;grade Lactobacillus casei to form biomimetic phage&#8208;like microparticles with a tails&#8208;pike structure. These particles can invade bacterial membranes and release NO to disrupt nitrogen and respiratory metabolisms, which initiate the programmed death of multidrug&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) for inducing lysis, like the bacterial virus. Experiments suggest that these microparticles can also weaken bacterial toxicity and provide favorable conditions for cell proliferation because of the continuously released NO. By encapsulating these microparticles into graphene oxide&#8208;doped polymers, a dual&#8208;mode antibacterial hydrogel (DMAH) can be constructed. In vivo results revealed that the DMAH achieved a long&#8208;time sterilization of MRSA with 99.84 &#177; 0.13% antibacterial rate in the dark because of the phage&#8208;like performance of the biomimetic microparticles. In its other antibacterial mode, DMAH subjected 20&#160;min of near&#8208;infrared irradiation released NO that, together with the photothermal effect, synergistically damaged bacterial cell membranes to achieve very fast disinfection (97.13 &#177; 0.41% bactericidal rate). This multi&#8208;functional hydrogel can also significantly accelerate wound healing due to the phage&#8208;like particles.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effectively clearing multidrug-resistant bacteria through non-antibiotic treatments is crucial for the recovery of infected tissues in favorable biological environments. Herein, a thermally responsive donor of cell-messenger nitric oxide (NO) was combined with extracts of food-grade &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus casei&lt;/i&gt; to form biomimetic phage-like microparticles with a tails-pike structure. These particles can invade bacterial membranes and release NO to disrupt nitrogen and respiratory metabolisms, which initiate the programmed death of multidrug-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (MRSA) for inducing lysis, like the bacterial virus. Experiments suggest that these microparticles can also weaken bacterial toxicity and provide favorable conditions for cell proliferation because of the continuously released NO. By encapsulating these microparticles into graphene oxide-doped polymers, a dual-mode antibacterial hydrogel (DMAH) can be constructed. In vivo results revealed that the DMAH achieved a long-time sterilization of MRSA with 99.84 &#177; 0.13% antibacterial rate in the dark because of the phage-like performance of the biomimetic microparticles. In its other antibacterial mode, DMAH subjected 20&#160;min of near-infrared irradiation released NO that, together with the photothermal effect, synergistically damaged bacterial cell membranes to achieve very fast disinfection (97.13 &#177; 0.41% bactericidal rate). This multi-functional hydrogel can also significantly accelerate wound healing due to the phage-like particles.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
Atomic&#8208;scale utilization and coordination structure of Pt electrocatalyst is extremely crucial to decrease loading mass and maximize activity for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). A novel atomic&#8208;scale (Pt&#8208;Ox)&#8208;(Co&#8208;Oy) non&#8208;bonding active structure is designed and constructed by anchoring Pt single atoms (Pt&#8208;SAs) and Co atomic clusters (Co&#8208;ACs) on the defective carbon derived from oxygen&#8208;rich coal tar pitch (CTP). Pt loading mass is extremely low and only 0.56&#160;wt.%. A new non&#8208;bonding interaction phenomenon between Pt&#8208;Ox and Co&#8208;Oy is found and confirmed based on XAS and DFT calculations. Based on the (Pt&#8208;Ox)&#8208;(Co&#8208;Oy) non&#8208;bonding active structure, surface chemical field coupling with electrocatalysis for HER and ORR is confirmed. It is found that (Pt&#8208;Ox)&#8208;(Co&#8208;Oy) non&#8208;bonding active structure exhibits high mass activities of 64.4 A cm&#8722;2 mgPt&#8722;1 (at an overpotential of 100&#160;mV) and 7.2 A cm&#8722;2 mgPt&#8722;1 (at 0.8&#160;V versus RHE) for HER and ORR, respectively. The values are 6.5 and 11.6 times as much as those of commercial 20% Pt/C. The work provides innovative insight to design and understand the efficient active sites of atomic&#8208;scale Pt on oxygen&#8208;rich CTP&#8208;derived carbon support for electrocatalysis.

Abstract
Motivated by the intricate mechanisms underlying biomolecule syntheses in cells that chemistry is currently unable to mimic, researchers have harnessed biological systems for manufacturing novel materials. Cell&#8208;free systems (CFSs) utilizing the bioactivity of transcriptional and translational machineries in vitro are excellent tools that allow supplementation of exogenous materials for production of innovative materials beyond the capability of natural biological systems. Herein, recent studies that have advanced the ability to expand the scope of biobased materials using CFS have been summarized and approaches enabling the production of high&#8208;value materials, prototyping of genetic parts and modules, and biofunctionalization have been discussed. By extending the reach of chemical and enzymatic reactions complementary to cellular materials, CFSs provide new opportunities at the interface of materials science and synthetic biology.

         <title>Reversibly Controlled Ternary Polar States and Ferroelectric Bias Promoted by Boosting Square&#8208;Tensile&#8208;Strain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new cubic perovskite substrate BaZrO3 promotes an innovative ferroelectric state and functionality in heteroepitaxial BaTiO3 film through applications of square tensile strain. The isotropic strain induces intriguing four&#8208;variants polar domains of in&#8208;plane spontaneous polarization. Cooperation between the built&#8208;in local point defect&#8208;dipole and the four&#8208;variants polar domains enables the reversible control of ternary polar states.








Abstract
Interaction between dipoles often emerges intriguing physical phenomena, such as exchange bias in the magnetic heterostructures and magnetoelectric effect in multiferroics, which lead to advances in multifunctional heterostructures. However, the defect&#8208;dipole tends to be considered the undesired to deteriorate the electronic functionality. Here, deterministic switching between the ferroelectric and the pinched states by exploiting a new substrate of cubic perovskite, BaZrO3 is reported, which boosts the square&#8208;tensile&#8208;strain to BaTiO3 and promotes four&#8208;variants in&#8208;plane spontaneous polarization with oxygen vacancy creation. First&#8208;principles calculations propose a complex of an oxygen vacancy and two Ti3+ ions coins a charge&#8208;neutral defect&#8208;dipole. Cooperative control of the defect&#8208;dipole and the spontaneous polarization reveals ternary in&#8208;plane polar states characterized by biased/pinched hysteresis loops. Furthermore, it is experimentally demonstrated that three electrically controlled polar&#8208;ordering states lead to switchable and nonvolatile dielectric states for application of nondestructive electro&#8208;dielectric memory. This discovery opens a new route to develop functional materials via manipulating defect&#8208;dipoles and offers a novel platform to advance heteroepitaxy beyond the prevalent perovskite substrates.

         <title>Step&#8208;Climbing Epitaxy of Layered Materials with Giant Out&#8208;of&#8208;Plane Lattice Mismatch</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A step&#8208;climbing epitaxy growth strategy is proposed, in which epilayers grow across the stepped surfaces and form continuous films. Based on the step&#8208;climbing epitaxy, wafer&#8208;scale uniform 2D Bi2O2Se films with controllable thickness can be obtained. One&#8208;unit&#8208;cell films exhibit a high room&#8208;temperature Hall mobility of 180 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, which exceeds that of silicon and other 2D semiconductors with comparable thickness.








Abstract
Heteroepitaxy with large lattice mismatch remains a great challenge for high&#8208;quality epifilm growth. Although great efforts have been devoted to epifilm growth with an in&#8208;plane lattice mismatch, the epitaxy of 2D layered crystals on stepped substrates with a giant out&#8208;of&#8208;plane lattice mismatch is seldom reported. Here, taking the molecular&#8208;beam epitaxy of 2D semiconducting Bi2O2Se on 3D SrTiO3 substrates as an example, a step&#8208;climbing epitaxy growth strategy is proposed, in which the n&#8208;th (n&#160;= 1, 2, 3&#8230;) epilayer climbs the step with height difference from out&#8208;of&#8208;plane lattice mismatch and continues to grow the n+1&#8208;th epilayer. Step&#8208;climbing epitaxy can spontaneously relax and release the strain from the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane lattice mismatch, which ensures the high quality of large&#8208;area epitaxial films. Wafer&#8208;scale uniform 2D Bi2O2Se single&#8208;crystal films with controllable thickness can be obtained via step&#8208;climbing epitaxy. Most notably, one&#8208;unit&#8208;cell Bi2O2Se films (1.2&#160;nm thick) exhibit a high Hall mobility of 180 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 at room temperature, which exceeds that of silicon and other 2D semiconductors with comparable thickness. As an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane lattice mismatch is generally present in the epitaxy of layered materials, the step&#8208;climbing epitaxy strategy expands the existing epitaxial growth theory and provides guidance toward the high&#8208;quality synthesis of layered materials.

         <title>Judicious Design and Rapid Manufacturing of a Flexible, Mechanically Resistant Liquid&#8208;Like Coating with Strong Bonding and Antifouling Abilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid approach is reported for manufacture of liquid&#8208;like polymer coatings through judicious construction of a semi&#8208;interpenetrating polymer network structure under UV irradiation. Various liquids, including high&#8208;viscosity oils, can easily slide off the anti&#8208;adhesion surface. Furthermore, this robust coating is flexible and applicable for various substrates. Strikingly, it has a strong substrate bonding force both in air and underwater.








Abstract
Fluorine&#8208;free liquid&#8208;repellent coatings have been highly demanded for a variety of applications. However, rapid formation of coatings possessing outstanding oil repellency and strong bonding ability as well as good mechanical strength (e.g., bendability, impact resistance, and scratch resistance) remains a grand challenge. Herein, a robust strategy to rapidly create fluorine&#8208;free oil&#8208;repellent coatings in only 30 s via rational design of a semi&#8208;interpenetrating polymer network structure is reported. The resulting coating manifests strong bonding capability both in air and underwater. More importantly, it not only provides unprecedented oil repellency, even to high&#8208;viscosity crude oil, but also achieves both excellent bendability and hardness. This simple yet effective design strategy opens up a new avenue to manufacture multifunctional materials and devices with desirable features and structural complexities for applications in sustainable antifouling, drag reduction, nondestructive transportation, liquid collection, and biomedicine, among other areas.

         <title>Progress and Perspectives of Single&#8208;atom Catalysts for Gas Sensing</title>

         <dc:description>
Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted extensive attention in the field of heterogeneous catalysis in recent years due to the maximum atom utilization and unique physical and chemical properties. The gas sensing is actually a heterogeneous catalysis process, but the SACs just emerged in this area a few years ago. Although SACs have shown huge potential in gas sensing, the SACs gas sensing area currently is still at the infancy stage. This work critically reviews the recent advances and current status of SAC&#8208;based gas sensing materials. General synthesis routes, characterization methods, and sensing performance indexes are introduced. At the end, the challenges and future prospects on SACs gas sensing are presented from our perspectives. This work is anticipated to provide insights and guideline for the chemical sensing community.

         <title>Calcium Fluoride Nanozyme for Ultrasound&#8208;Amplified and Ca2+ Overload&#8208;Enhanced Catalytic Tumor Nanotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The anticancer mechanism of nanozyme is dominantly associated with generation capacity of reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by the valence change of metal elements. However, very few researches have been focused and achieved on the exploration and development of enzyme&#8208;mimicking activities of valence&#8208;invariable metal compound. Herein, the distinct valence&#8208;invariable calcium fluoride (CaF2) nanozyme with ultrasound (US)&#8208;enhanced peroxidase (POD)&#8208;mimicking activity is rationally designed and engineered for efficient calcium (Ca2+) overload&#8208;enhanced catalytic tumor nanotherapy, which is the first paradigm of Ca&#8208;based nanozymes for catalytic cancer treatment. The release of exogenous Ca2+ ions from CaF2 nanocrystals and deleterious ROS generation derived from US&#8208;amplified POD&#8208;mimicking properties facilitate intracellular Ca2+ accumulation and achieve Ca2+ overload&#8208;induced mitochondrial dysfunction through introducing exogenous Ca2+ ions and regulating calcium&#8208;pumping channels of neoplastic cells. Especially, US as exogenous energy input is capable of substantially amplifying POD&#8208;mimicking catalytic activities of CaF2 nanozyme, ultimately achieving efficient antineoplastic outcome on both 4T1 breast tumor and H22 hepatic carcinoma animal models. Such a discovery of enzyme&#8208;like activity of valence&#8208;invariable metal compound can broaden the cognition scope of nanozymes and effectively serve the field of catalytic and chemoreactive nanomedicine.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Phase Morphology with Enhanced Carrier Lifetime via Quaternary Strategy Enables High&#8208;Efficiency Thick&#8208;Film and Large&#8208;Area Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
With the continuous breakthrough of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) efficiency, their practical applications are on the agenda. However, the thickness tolerance and upscaling in recently reported high&#8208;efficiency devices remains challenging. In this work, the multi&#8208;phase morphology and desired carrier behaviors were realized by utilizing the quaternary strategy. Notably, the exciton separation, carrier mobility, and carrier lifetime are enhanced significantly, the carrier recombination and the energy loss (Eloss) is reduced, thus beneficial for the higher short&#8208;circuit density (JSC), fill factor (FF) and open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of the quaternary system. Moreover, the intermixing&#8208;phase size was optimized, favorable for constructing the thick&#8208;film and large&#8208;area devices. Finally, the device with 110&#160;nm thick active layer shows an outstanding PCE of 19.32% (certified 19.35%). Furthermore, the large&#8208;area (1.05 cm2 and 72.25 cm2) devices with 110&#160;nm thickness present PCEs of 18.25% and 12.20%, and the device with 305&#160;nm thick film (0.0473 cm2) delivers a PCE of 17.55%, which are among the highest values reported. Our work demonstrates the potential of quaternary strategy for large&#8208;area and thick&#8208;film OPVs and promotes the practical application of OPV in the future.

         <title>Activity&#8208;Based Photosensitizer to Reverse Hypoxia and Oxidative Resistance for Tumor Photodynamic Eradication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been a well&#8208;accepted clinical treatment for malignant tumors owing to its non&#8208;invasiveness and high spatiotemporal selectivity. However, the treatment outcome of current PDT applications is hindered by hypoxia and intracellular oxidative resistance of solid tumors. Recent studies showed that inhibiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) could induce cell ferroptosis, reverse hypoxia and elevate oxidative status. Theoretically, the design and synthesis of activity&#8208;based photosensitizers that target HDACs could address the bottlenecks of PDT. Herein, we present a concept of activity&#8208;based photosensitizer for targeting HDACs, which was designed based on a quinoxalinone scaffold through a pharmacophore migration strategy. The developed activity&#8208;based photosensitizer could inhibit HDACs, and overcome hypoxia and intracellular oxidative resistance, realizing the full potential of photosensitizers for malignant tumor treatment. The molecular design strategy proposed in this project should provide theoretical guidance for the development of ideal photosensitizers for practical applications.

         <title>In Situ Growth of Covalent Organic Framework Nanosheets on Graphene as the Cathode for Long&#8208;Life High&#8208;Capacity Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sophisticated covalent organic framework (COF)&#160;predesign and synthetic strategy, with the assistance of materials processing technology, results in a new COF&#8208;based high&#8208;performance organic cathode for practical lithium&#8208;ion batteries, with a specific capacity of 285&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at current density of 0.2&#160;C, and retained capacity of 170&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 after 6000 cycles at 5&#160;C.








Abstract
The poor electronic and ionic conductivities of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) severely restrict the development of COF&#8208;based electrodes for practical rechargeable batteries, therefore inspiring more research interest from the direction of both material synthesis and technology. Herein, a dual&#8208;porous COF, USTB&#8208;6, with good crystallinity and rich redox&#8208;active sites is conceived and fabricated by the polymerization of 2,3,8,9,14,15&#8208;hexa(4&#8208;formylphenyl)diquinoxalino [2,3&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine and 2,7&#8208;diaminopyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone. In particular, the heterogeneous polymerization of the same starting materials in the presence of graphene affords uniformly dispersed COF nanosheets with a thickness of 8.3&#160;nm on a conductive carbon substrate, effectively enhancing the electronic conductivity of the COF&#8208;based electrode. Such a graphene&#8208;supported USTB&#8208;6 nanosheets cathode when used in a lithium&#8208;ion battery exhibits a specific capacity of 285&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 0.2&#160;C and excellent rate performance with a prominent capacity of 188&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10&#160;C. More importantly, a capacity of 170&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 is retained by using the USTB&#8208;6 nanosheets cathode after 6000 cycles charge and discharge measurement at 5&#160;C.

         <title>Tuning Zn&#8208;Ion Solvation Chemistry with Chelating Ligands toward Stable Aqueous Zn Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stability constant (K) of ligand, which reflects its interaction with Zn ions, is proposed to ean ideal parameter to decode how the solvation chemistry intrinsically regulates the corrosion current density and nucleation overpotential of a stable Zn anode, toward long&#8208;life aqueous batteries.








Abstract
Changing the solvation sheath of hydrated Zn ions is an effective strategy to stabilize Zn anodes to obtain a practical aqueous Zn&#8208;ion battery. However, key points related to the rational design remain unclear including how the properties of the solvent molecules intrinsically regulate the solvated structure of the Zn ions. This study proposes the use of&#160;a stability constant (K), namely, the equilibrium constant of the complexation reaction, as a universal standard to make an accurate selection of ligands in the electrolyte to improve the anode stability. It is found that K greatly impacts the corrosion current density and nucleation overpotential. Following this, ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid with a superhigh K effectively suppresses Zn corrosion and induces uniform Zn&#8208;ion deposition. As a result, the anode has an excellent stability of over 3000&#160;h. This work presents a general principle to stabilize anodes by regulating the solvation chemistry, guiding the development of novel electrolytes for sustainable aqueous batteries.

         <title>Polarized Cu&#8211;Bi Site Pairs for Non&#8208;Covalent to Covalent Interaction Tuning toward N2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal atomic&#8208;layer&#8208;confined doping strategy is developed to prepare Bi24O31Br10 materials incorporating isolated Cu (Fe, Co, Ni) atoms. The polarized Cu&#8211;Bi site pairs favor better electron delocalization for effective N2 activation, and can work as reactive sites to tune the non&#8208;covalent interactions of the intermediates, optimize the covalent bond order in N&#63743;N, and alter the hydrogenation pathways.








Abstract
A universal atomic layer confined doping strategy is developed to prepare Bi24O31Br10 materials incorporating isolated Cu atoms. The local polarization can be created along the Cu&#63743;O&#63743;Bi atomic interface, which enables better electron delocalization for effective N2 activation. The optimized Cu&#8208;Bi24O31Br10 atomic layers show 5.3&#215; and 88.2&#215; improved photocatalytic nitrogen fixation activity than Bi24O31Br10 atomic layer and bulk Bi24O31Br10, respectively, with the NH3 generation rate reaching 291.1&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in pure water. The polarized Cu&#8211;Bi site pairs can increase the non&#8208;covalent interaction between the catalyst's surface and N2 molecules, then further weaken the covalent bond order in N&#63743;N. As a result, the hydrogenation pathways can be altered from the associative distal pathway for Bi24O31Br10 to the alternating pathway for Cu&#8208;Bi24O31Br10. This strategy provides an accessible pathway for designing polarized metal site pairs or tuning the non&#8208;covalent interaction and covalent bond order.

         <title>Enriched&#8208;Bromine Surface State for Stable Sky&#8208;Blue Spectrum Perovskite QLEDs With an EQE of 14.6%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enriched&#8208;bromine surface state is controlled by employing PbBr2 stock solution for anion&#8208;exchange based on Cd&#8208;doping perovskite quantum dots (QDs), which shows good passivation to the vacancy defects, resulting in boosted optical properties and stability. The stable sky&#8208;blue spectrum quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) based on the controlled QDs are conducted with a record EQE of 14.6% and current efficiency (CE) of 19.9 Cd A&#8722;1.








Abstract
Halogen vacancies are of great concern in blue&#8208;emitting perovskite quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes because they affect their efficiency and spectral shift. Here, an enriched&#8208;bromine surface state is realized using a facile strategy that employs a PbBr2 stock solution for anion exchange based on Cd&#8208;doped perovskite quantum dots. It is found that the doped Cd ions are expected to reduce the formation energy of halogen vacancies filled by the external bromine ions, and the excess free bromine ions in solution are enriched in the surface by anchoring with halogen vacancies as sites, accompanied with the shedding of surface long&#8208;chain ligands during the anion exchange process, resulting in a Br&#8208;rich and &#8220;neat&#8221; surface. Moreover, the surface state exhibits good passivation of the surface defects of the controlled perovskite QDs and simultaneously increases the exciton binding energy, leading to excellent optical properties and stability. Finally, the sky&#8208;blue emitting perovskite quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) (490&#160;nm) are conducted with a record external quantum efficiency of 14.6% and current efficiency of 19.9&#160;cd A&#8722;1. Meanwhile, the electroluminescence spectra exhibit great stability with negligible shifts under a constant operating voltage from 3 to 7&#160;V. This strategy paves the way for improving the efficiency and stability of perovskite QLEDs.

Gold nanoparticle plasmonic ordered arrays are fabricated by an unconventional in situ approach where gold precursors are reduced directly at specific pre&#8208;patterned locations on substrates. Nanoparticle morphology and array periodicity are easily tuned using this method. The substrates exhibit far&#8208;field plasmonic coupling via the emergence of lattice plasmon resonances, constituting a major step forward for in situ growth techniques.








Abstract
Precise arrangements of plasmonic nanoparticles on substrates are important for designing optoelectronics, sensors and metamaterials with rational electronic, optical and magnetic properties. Bottom&#8208;up synthesis offers unmatched control over morphology and optical response of individual plasmonic building blocks. Usually, the incorporation of nanoparticles made by bottom&#8208;up wet chemistry starts from batch synthesis of colloids, which requires time&#8208;consuming and hard&#8208;to&#8208;scale steps like ligand exchange and self&#8208;assembly. Herein, an unconventional bottom&#8208;up wet&#8208;chemical synthetic approach for producing gold nanoparticle ordered arrays is developed. Water&#8208;processable hydroxypropyl cellulose stencils facilitate the patterning of a reductant chemical ink on which nanoparticle growth selectively occurs. Arrays exhibiting lattice plasmon resonances in the visible region and near infrared (quality factors of &gt;20) are produced following a rapid synthetic step (&lt;10&#160;min), all without cleanroom fabrication, specialized equipment, or self&#8208;assembly, constituting a major step forward in establishing in situ growth approaches. Further, the technical capabilities of this method through modulation of the particle size, shape, and array spacings directly on the substrate are demonstrated. Ultimately, establishing a fundamental understanding of in situ growth has the potential to inform the fabrication of plasmonic materials; opening the door for in situ growth fabrication of waveguides, lasing platforms, and plasmonic sensors.

The preferred (100) surface engineering of CsPbBr3 perovskite single&#8208;crystals enables a low surface bandgap energy (2.33&#160;eV) and high&#8208;rate carrier mobility up to 241&#160;&#956;m2&#160;V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, inherently boosting their light&#8208;harvesting and carrier transport capability. Meanwhile, polar (111) surface engineering induces &#8776;0.16&#160;eV upward surface&#8208;band bending and ultrahigh surface defect density of 1.49&#160;&#215;&#160;1015&#160;cm&#8722;3, which may be beneficial for enhancing surface&#8208;defects&#8208;catalyzed reactions.








Abstract
Engineering surface structure can precisely and effectively tune the optoelectronic properties of halide perovskites, but are incredibly challenging. Herein, the design and fabrication of uniform all&#8208;inorganic CsPbBr3 cubic/tetrahedral single&#8208;crystals are reported with precise control of the (100) and (111) surface anisotropy, respectively. By combining&#160;with theoretical calculations, it is demonstrated that the preferred (100) surface engineering of the CsPbBr3 single&#8208;crystals enables a lowest surface bandgap energy (2.33&#160;eV) and high&#8208;rate carrier mobility up to 241&#160;&#956;m2&#160;V&#8208;1&#160;s&#8208;1, inherently boosting their light&#8208;harvesting and carrier&#8208;transport capability. Meanwhile, the polar (111) surface induces &#8776;0.16&#160;eV upward surface&#8208;band bending and ultrahigh surface defect density of 1.49&#160;&#215;&#160;1015&#160;cm&#8208;3, which is beneficial for enhancing surface&#8208;defects&#8208;catalyzed reactions. The work highlights the anisotropic surface engineering for boosting perovskite optoelectronic devices and beyond.

         <title>Wireless Stand&#8208;Alone Trimodal Interactive Display Enabled by Direct Capacitive Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wireless stand&#8208;alone trimodal interactive display is presented where finger touch is displayed with three types of outputs of field&#8208;induced electroluminescence, inverse piezoelectric sound, and tactile vibration remotely powered by unique alternating current (AC)&#8208;to&#8208;AC power transfer based on direct capacitive coupling, making the device potentially suitable for a smart three&#8208;mode braille display.








Abstract
With recent advances in interactive displays, the development of a stand&#8208;alone interactive display with no electrical interconnection is of great interest. Here, a wireless stand&#8208;alone interactive display (WiSID), enabled by direct capacitive coupling, consisting of three layers: two in&#8208;plane metal electrodes separated by a gap, a composite layer for field&#8208;induced electroluminescence (EL) and inverse piezoelectric sound, and a stimuli&#8208;responsive layer, from bottom to top, is presented. Alternating current power necessary for field&#8208;induced EL and inverse piezoelectric sound is wirelessly transferred from a power unit, with two in&#8208;plane electrodes remotely separated from the WiSID. The unique in&#8208;plane power transfer through the stimuli&#8208;sensitive polar bridge allows stand&#8208;alone operation of the WiSID, making it suitable for the wireless dynamic monitoring of medical fluids. Moreover, a haptic wireless stand&#8208;alone trimodal interactive display mounted on a human finger is demonstrated, whereby touch is wirelessly displayed in various outputs of EL, inverse piezoelectric sound, and tactile vibration, making it suitable for a wireless three&#8208;mode smart braille display.

         <title>Unlocking Layered Double Hydroxide as a High&#8208;Performance Cathode Material for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Trinary layered double hydroxide (LDH) with hydrogen vacancies is proposed as a new cathode material for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. With the existence of H vacancies and the synergy of trinary transitional metal cations in LDH, the electrode exhibits a high reversible capacity of 328 mAh g&#8722;1 and excellent cycling stability over 500 cycles with a capacity retention of 85%.








Abstract
Advanced cathode materials play an important role in promoting aqueous battery technology for safe energy storage. Transition metal double hydroxides are usually elusive as a stable cathode for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) due to their unstable crystal structure, sluggish ion transportation, and insufficient active sites for zinc&#8208;ion storage. Here, a trinary layered double hydroxide (LDH) with hydrogen vacancies (Ni3Mn0.7Fe0.3&#8208;LDH) is reported as a new cathode material for AZIBs. A reversible high capacity up to 328 mAh g&#8722;1 can be obtained and cycle stably over 500 cycles with a capacity retention of 85%. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the hydrogen vacancies in LDH can expose lattice oxygen atoms as active sites for zinc&#8208;ion storage and accelerate ion diffusion by reducing the electrostatic interactions between zinc ions and the host structure. In addition, the synergy of the trinary transitional metal cations can suppress the Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion of manganese (III) oxide octahedron and enable long cycle stability. This work provides not only a series of high&#8208;performance cathode materials for AZIBs but also a novel materials design strategy that can be extended to other multi&#8208;valence metal&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Unlocking Interfacial Electron Transfer of Ruthenium Phosphides by Homologous Core&#8211;Shell Design toward Efficient Hydrogen Evolution and Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A system where homologous core&#8211;shell RuP@RuP2 nanoparticles are well dispersed on functional carbon nanosheets (RuP@RuP2/C) is synthesized via a phosphatization&#8208;controlled phase&#8208;transformation strategy. The emergent interfacial functionality enables very efficient electron transfer from the RuP core to the RuP2 shell, leading to accelerated hydrogen adsorption/desorption kinetics of RuP@RuP2/C toward high&#8208;efficiency alkaline hydrogen evolution and oxidation, which are among the best reported bifunctional hydrogen electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions (HER/HOR) in alkaline electrolytes is of critical importance for realizing renewable hydrogen technologies. Ruthenium phosphides (RuPx) are promising candidates to substitute Pt&#8208;based electrodes; however, great challenges still remain in their electronic structure regulation for optimizing intermediate adsorption. Herein, it is reported that a homologous RuP@RuP2 core&#8211;shell architecture constructed by a phosphatization&#8208;controlled phase&#8208;transformation strategy enables strong electron coupling for optimal intermediate adsorption by virtue of the emergent interfacial functionality. Density functional theory calculations show that the RuP core and RuP2 shell present efficient electron transfer, leading to a close to thermoneutral hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy of 0.04&#160;eV. Impressively, the resulting material exhibits superior HER/HOR activities in alkaline media, which outperform the benchmark Pt/C and are among the best reported bifunctional hydrogen electrocatalysts. The present work not only provides an efficient and cost&#8208;effective bifunctional hydrogen electrocatalyst, but also offers a new synthetic protocol to rationally synthesize homologous core&#8211;shell nanostructures for widespread applications.

     alt="Unlocking Interfacial Electron Transfer of Ruthenium Phosphides by Homologous Core&#8211;Shell Design toward Efficient Hydrogen Evolution and Oxidation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A system where homologous core&#8211;shell RuP@RuP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles are well dispersed on functional carbon nanosheets (RuP@RuP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C) is synthesized via a phosphatization-controlled phase-transformation strategy. The emergent interfacial functionality enables very efficient electron transfer from the RuP core to the RuP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; shell, leading to accelerated hydrogen adsorption/desorption kinetics of RuP@RuP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C toward high-efficiency alkaline hydrogen evolution and oxidation, which are among the best reported bifunctional hydrogen electrocatalysts.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing high-efficiency electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions (HER/HOR) in alkaline electrolytes is of critical importance for realizing renewable hydrogen technologies. Ruthenium phosphides (RuP&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;) are promising candidates to substitute Pt-based electrodes; however, great challenges still remain in their electronic structure regulation for optimizing intermediate adsorption. Herein, it is reported that a homologous RuP@RuP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; core&#8211;shell architecture constructed by a phosphatization-controlled phase-transformation strategy enables strong electron coupling for optimal intermediate adsorption by virtue of the emergent interfacial functionality. Density functional theory calculations show that the RuP core and RuP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; shell present efficient electron transfer, leading to a close to thermoneutral hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy of 0.04&#160;eV. Impressively, the resulting material exhibits superior HER/HOR activities in alkaline media, which outperform the benchmark Pt/C and are among the best reported bifunctional hydrogen electrocatalysts. The present work not only provides an efficient and cost-effective bifunctional hydrogen electrocatalyst, but also offers a new synthetic protocol to rationally synthesize homologous core&#8211;shell nanostructures for widespread applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fingerprints Indicating Superior Properties of Internal Interfaces in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 Thin&#8208;Film Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;poor and Cu&#8208;rich Cu(In,Ga)Se2 absorbers are investigated using correlative microscopy based on the atom probe tomography technique. With that, typical fingerprints for superior properties of internal interfaces necessary for maintaining a lower recombination activity in the cell are discovered. These are Cu&#8208;depleted and Cd&#8208;enriched Cu(In,Ga)Se2 absorber surfaces, as well as negative Cu factor (&#8710;&#946;) and high Na content at the grain boundaries.








Abstract
Growth of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) absorbers under Cu&#8208;poor conditions gives rise to incorporation of numerous defects into the bulk, whereas the same absorber grown under Cu&#8208;rich conditions leads to a stoichiometric bulk with minimum defects. This suggests that CIGS absorbers grown under Cu&#8208;rich conditions are more suitable for solar cell applications. However, the CIGS solar cell devices with record efficiencies have all been fabricated under Cu&#8208;poor conditions, despite the expectations. Therefore, in the present work, both Cu&#8208;poor and Cu&#8208;rich CIGS cells are investigated, and the superior properties of the internal interfaces of the Cu&#8208;poor CIGS cells, such as the p&#8211;n junction and grain boundaries, which always makes them the record&#8208;efficiency devices, are shown. More precisely, by employing a correlative microscopy approach, the typical fingerprints for superior properties of internal interfaces necessary for maintaining a lower recombination activity in the cell is discovered. These are a Cu&#8208;depleted and Cd&#8208;enriched CIGS absorber surface, near the p&#8211;n junction, as well as&#160;a negative Cu factor (&#8710;&#946;) and high Na content (&gt;1.5 at%) at the grain boundaries. Thus, this work provides key factors governing the device performance (efficiency), which can be considered in the design of next&#8208;generation solar cells.

         <title>Herpesvirus&#8208;Mimicking DNAzyme&#8208;Loaded Nanoparticles as a Mitochondrial DNA Stress Inducer to Activate Innate Immunity for Tumor Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
Herpesvirus&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles (Vir&#8208;ZM@TD) that activate antitumor innate immunity are reported. DNAzyme&#8208;loaded manganese&#8209;doped zeolitic imidazolate frameworks&#8209;90 (ZIF&#8208;90) nanoparticles (ZM@TD) mimic the virus nucleocapsid containing the genome; the erythrocyte membrane mimics the viral envelope; and two functional peptides, RGD and HA2 peptides, resemble the surface glycoprotein spikes of herpesvirus. The system effectively primes cGAS&#8208;STING pathway&#8208;mediated innate immunity with 68% complete regression of primary tumors and extends the median survival time of 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice by 32 days.








Abstract
Virus&#8208;based immunotherapy is a promising approach to treat tumor. Closely mimicking the structure and sequential infection processes of natural viruses is highly desirable for effective tumor immunotherapy but remains challenging. Here, inspired by the robust innate immunity induced by herpesvirus, a herpesvirus&#8208;mimicking nanoparticle (named Vir&#8208;ZM@TD) is engineered for tumor therapy by mimicking the structure and infection processes of herpesvirus. In this biomimetic system, DNAzyme&#8208;loaded manganese&#8209;doped zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8209;90 (ZIF&#8208;90) nanoparticles (ZM@TD) mimic the virus nucleocapsid containing the genome; the erythrocyte membrane mimics the viral envelope; and two functional peptides, RGD and HA2 peptides, resemble the surface glycoprotein spikes of herpesvirus. Vir&#8208;ZM@TD can both effectively evade rapid clearance in the blood circulation and closely mimic the serial infection processes of herpesvirus, including specific tumor targeting, membrane fusion&#8208;mediated endosomal escape, and TFAM (transcription factor A, mitochondrial) deficiency&#8208;triggered mitochondrial DNA stress, as well as the release of manganese ions (Mn2+) from organelles into the cytosol, ultimately effectively priming cGAS&#8208;STING pathway&#8208;mediated innate immunity with 68% complete regression of primary tumors and extending by 32 days the median survival time of 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice.

         <title>Supramolecular Nitric Oxide Depot for Hypoxic Tumor Vessel Normalization and Radiosensitization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular nitric oxide (NO) depot (SupraNO) for &#946;&#8208;galactosidase&#8208;controlled NO release is reported. SupraNO can provide low&#8208;dose NO continuously and release a large amount of NO immediately on&#8208;demand providing an effective solution for both vessel normalization by low&#8208;dose long&#8208;time NO supply and radiosensitization by temporary high&#8208;dose stimulation in hypoxic tumor.








Abstract
In cancer radiotherapy, the lack of fixed DNA&#160;damage by oxygen in hypoxic microenvironment of solid tumors often leads to severe radioresistance. Nitric oxide (NO) is a potent radiosensitizer that acts in two ways. It can directly react with the radical DNA thus fixing the damage. It also normalizes the abnormal tumor vessels, thereby increasing blood perfusion and oxygen supply. To achieve these functions, the dosage and duration of NO treatment need to be carefully controlled, otherwise it will lead to the exact opposite outcomes. However, a delivery method that fulfills both requirements is still lacking. A NO depot is designed for the control of NO releasing both over quantity and duration for hypoxic tumor vessel normalization and radiosensitization. In B16&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice, the depot can provide low dosage NO continuously and release large amount of NO immediately before irradiation for a short period of time. These two modes of treatment work in synergy to reverse the radioresistance of B16&#160;tumors more efficiently than releasing at single dosage.

         <title>Synergizing Hydrogen Spillover and Deprotonation by the Internal Polarization Field in a MoS2/NiPS3 Vertical Heterostructure for Boosted Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The internal polarization field (IPF) in a bicomponent MoS2/NiPS3 electrocatalyst can engineer both interfacial hydrogen spillover (HSo) and dual&#8208;path deprotonation (DeP) to empower the catalyst with a bifunctional water&#8208;splitting activity. This research puts forward the IPF as the criterion in the rational design of HSo/DeP&#8208;unified non&#8208;precious catalysts for highly efficient water electrolysis.








Abstract
Hydrogen spillover (HSo) has emerged to upgrade the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of Pt&#8208;support electrocatalysts, but it is not applicable to the deprotonated oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Non&#8208;precious catalysts that can perform well in both HSo and deprotonation (DeP) are extremely desirable for a sustainable hydrogen economy. Herein, an affordable MoS2/NiPS3 vertical heterostructure catalyst is presented to synergize HSo and DeP for efficient water electrolysis. The internal polarization field (IPF) is clarified as the driving force of HSo in HER electrocatalysis. The HSo from the MoS2 edge to NiPS3 can activate the NiPS3 basal plane to boost the HER activity of the MoS2/NiPS3 heterostructure (112&#160;mV vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2), while for OER, the IPF in the heterostructure can facilitate the hydroxyl diffusion and render MoS2&#8208;to&#8208;NiPS3/P&#8208;to&#8208;S dual&#8208;pathways for DeP. As a result, the stacking of OER&#8208;inactive MoS2 on the NiPS3 surface still brings intriguing OER enhancements. With them serving as electrode couples, the overall water splitting is attested stably with a cell voltage of 1.64&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This research puts forward the IPF as the criterion in the rational design of HSo/DeP&#8208;unified non&#8208;precious catalysts for efficient water electrolysis.

Non-precious catalysts that can perform well in both HSo and deprotonation (DeP) are extremely desirable for a sustainable hydrogen economy. Herein, an affordable MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/NiPS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; vertical heterostructure catalyst is presented to synergize HSo and DeP for efficient water electrolysis. The internal polarization field (IPF) is clarified as the driving force of HSo in HER electrocatalysis. The HSo from the MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; edge to NiPS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can activate the NiPS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; basal plane to boost the HER activity of the MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/NiPS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; heterostructure (112&#160;mV vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt;), while for OER, the IPF in the heterostructure can facilitate the hydroxyl diffusion and render MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-NiPS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/P-to-S dual-pathways for DeP. As a result, the stacking of OER-inactive MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on the NiPS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; surface still brings intriguing OER enhancements. With them serving as electrode couples, the overall water splitting is attested stably with a cell voltage of 1.64&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This research puts forward the IPF as the criterion in the rational design of HSo/DeP-unified non-precious catalysts for efficient water electrolysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Ultrahigh Rate and Stable Zinc Anode by Facet&#8208;Matching&#8208;Induced Dendrite Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of dendrite regulation,&#160;growing tiny, identical, and homogeneously distributed Zn dendrites by facet matching of Cu(111)/Zn(002),&#160;can achieve reversible Zn plating/stripping and long&#8208;life Zn anode at ultrahigh current densities.








Abstract
Resource&#8208;abundant metal (e.g., zinc) batteries feature intrinsic advantages of safety and sustainability. Their practical feasibility, however, is impeded by the poor reversibility of metal anodes, typically caused by the uncontrollable dendrite enlargement. Significant effort is exerted to completely prevent dendrites from forming, but this seems less effective at high current densities. Herein, this work presents an alternative dendrite regulation strategy of forming tiny, homogeneously distributed, and identical zinc dendrites by facet matching, which effectively avoids undesirable dendrite enlargement. Confirmed by multiscale theoretical screening and characterization, the regularly exposed Cu(111) facets at the ridges of a copper nanowire are capable of such dendrite regulation by forming a low&#8208;mismatched Zn(002)/Cu(111) interface. Consequently, reversible zinc electroplating/stripping is achieved at an unprecedentedly high rate of 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for over 30&#160;000 cycles, corresponding to an accumulative areal capacity up to 30 Ah cm&#8722;2. A full cell using this anode shows a high capacity of 308.3 mAh g&#8722;1 and a high capacity retention of 91.4% after 800 cycles. This strategy is also viable for magnesium and aluminum anodes, thus opening up a promising and universal avenue toward long&#8208;life and high&#8208;rate metal anodes.

         <title>Ultrathin Suspended Chiral Metasurfaces for Enantiodiscrimination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;aligned suspended chiral bilayer metasurface is developed with single&#8208;step electron beam lithography. A huge optical chirality of 221&#176;&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1 is achieved by the freestanding metasurfaces with overall thickness of 100&#160;nm. The bilayer metasurface demonstrates label&#8208;free discrimination of chiral molecules at zeptomoles level with orders of magnitude larger than conventional circular dichroism spectroscopy.








Abstract
Chiral metasurfaces can exhibit a strong circular dichroism, but it is limited by the complicated fabrication procedure and alignment errors. Here, a new type of self&#8208;aligned suspended chiral bilayer metasurface with only one&#8208;step electron beam lithography exposure is demonstrated. A significant optical chirality of 221&#176;&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1 can be realized using suspended metasurfaces with a thickness of 100&#160;nm. Furthermore, this study experimentally demonstrates that such a structure is capable of label&#8208;free discrimination of the chiral molecules at zeptomole level, exhibiting a much higher sensitivity (orders of magnitude) compared to the conventional circular dichroism spectroscopy. The fundamental principles for chiral sensing using molecules&#8211;metasurfaces interactions are explored. Benefiting from the giant chiroptical response, the proposed metadevice may offer promising applications for ultrathin circular polarizers, chiral molecular detectors, and asymmetry information processing.

         <title>Enabling Electron Injection for Microbial Electrosynthesis with n&#8208;Type Conjugated Polyelectrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating Shewanella oneidensis&#160;MR&#8208;1 with a newly synthesized n&#8208;type conjugated polyelectrolyte forms a 3D conductive network that allows efficient electron transfer from electrode to living cells, thereby enabling microbial electrosynthesis. The one&#8208;step self&#8208;assembly process offers a simple and effective strategy to improve bioelectrochemical systems.








Abstract
Microbial electrosynthesis&#8212;using renewable electricity to stimulate microbial metabolism&#8212;holds the promise of sustainable chemical production. A key limitation hindering performance is slow electron&#8208;transfer rates at biotic&#8211;abiotic interfaces. Here a new n&#8208;type conjugated polyelectrolyte is rationally designed and synthesized and its use is demonstrated as a soft conductive material to encapsulate electroactive bacteria Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1. The self&#8208;assembled 3D living biocomposite amplifies current uptake from the electrode &#8776;674&#8208;fold over controls with the same initial number of cells, thereby enabling continuous synthesis of succinate from fumarate. Such functionality is a result of the increased number of bacterial cells having intimate electronic communication with the electrode and a higher current uptake per cell. This is underpinned by the molecular design of the polymer to have an n&#8208;dopable conjugated backbone for facile reduction by the electrode and zwitterionic side chains for compatibility with aqueous media. Moreover, direct arylation polycondensation is employed instead of the traditional Stille polymerization to avoid non&#8208;biocompatible tin by&#8208;products. By demonstrating synergy between living cells with n&#8208;type organic semiconductor materials, these results provide new strategies for improving the performance of bioelectrosynthesis technologies.

         <title>Vapor&#8208;Assisted In Situ Recrystallization for Efficient Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controllable crystallization is particularly significant for tin perovskites because their fast crystallization rate usually causes high trap density and low photoluminescence quantum efficiency, thus resulting in low light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) efficiencies. In this work, a vapor&#8208;assisted spin&#8208;coating technique is developed to retard crystallization and improve the external quantum efficiency of tin perovskite LEDs up to 5.3%.








Abstract
Tin&#8208;based perovskites are a promising candidates to replace their toxic lead&#8208;based counterparts in optoelectronic applications, such as light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). However, the development of tin perovskite LEDs is slow due to the challenge of obtaining high&#8208;quality tin perovskite films. Here, a vapor&#8208;assisted spin&#8208;coating method is developed to achieve high&#8208;quality tin perovskites and high&#8208;efficiency LEDs. It is revealed that solvent vapor can lead to in situ recrystallization of tin perovskites during the film&#8208;formation process, thus significantly improving the crystalline quality with reduced defects. An antioxidant additive is further introduced to suppress the oxidation of Sn2+ and increase the photoluminescence quantum efficiency up to &#8776;30%, which is an approximately fourfold enhancement in comparison with that of the control method. As a result, efficient tin perovskite LEDs are achieved with a peak external quantum efficiency of 5.3%, which is among the highest efficiency of lead&#8208;free perovskite LEDs.

         <title>Highly Orientated Perovskite Quantum Dot Solids for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perovskite quantum dot (PQD) solid with a high orientation and substantially diminished nonradiative recombination is constructed using precursor engineering accompanied by a chemical stripping treatment of the PQDs. Consequently, the resultant inorganic PQD solar cell (PQDSC) delivers a high power conversion efficiency of up to 16.25%, among the highest efficiencies of inorganic PQDSCs.








Abstract
Perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) have emerged&#160;as competitive optoelectronic materials for photovoltaic applications due to their ideal bandgap energy, high defect tolerance, and solution processability. However, the highly dynamic surface and imperfect cubic structure of PQDs generally result in unfavorable charge&#8208;carrier transport within the PQD solids and serious nonradiative recombination. Herein, a highly orientated PQD solid is demonstrated using precursor engineering accompanied by a chemical stripping treatment (CST). A combination of systematic experimental studies and theoretical calculations is conducted to fundamentally understand the resurfacing of PQDs using the CST approach. The results reveal that the highly ordered PQDs can result in a high orientation of PQD solids, significantly promoting charge&#8208;carrier transport within the PQD solids. Meanwhile, the ideal cubic&#8208;structured PQD with an iodine&#8208;rich surface dramatically decreases surface trap states, thereby substantially diminishing trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination. Consequently, the inorganic PQD solar cell delivers a power conversion efficiency of up to 16.25%. This work provides a feasible avenue to construct highly orientated PQD solids with improved photophysical properties for high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Toward Tissue&#8208;Like Material Properties: Inducing In Situ Adaptive Behavior in Fibrous Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nature's gels, intracellular and extracellular are highly adaptive, which is very difficult to recreate in the lab. In this work, a synthetic fibrous network, functional cross&#8208;linkers, and a tailorable interaction between the two components are used to reversibly manipulate mechanical properties on&#8208;demand.








Abstract
The materials properties of biological tissues are unique. Nature is able to spatially and temporally manipulate (mechanical) properties while maintaining responsiveness toward a variety of cues; all without majorly changing the material's composition. Artificial mimics, synthetic or biomaterial&#8208;based are far less advanced and poorly reproduce the natural cell microenvironment. A viable strategy to generate materials with advanced properties combines different materials into nanocomposites. This work describes nanocomposites of a synthetic fibrous hydrogel, based on polyisocyanide (PIC), that is noncovalently linked to a responsive cross&#8208;linker. The introduction of the cross&#8208;linker transforms the PIC gel from a static fibrous extracellular matrix mimic to a highly dynamic material that maintains biocompatibility, as demonstrated by in situ modification of the (non)linear mechanical properties and efficient self&#8208;healing properties. Key in the material design is cross&#8208;linking at the fibrillar level using nanoparticles, which, simultaneously may be used to introduce more advanced properties.

         <title>Tackling Disorder in &#947;&#8208;Ga2O3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) is attracting increasing attention in applications such as power electronics and photodetectors due to its rich structural space and resulting electronic structure. This work explores the influence of structural disorder on a range of crucial material parameters of &#947;&#8208;phase Ga2O3 by combining density functional theory and machine learning with a range of experimental probes.








Abstract
Ga2O3 and its polymorphs are attracting increasing attention. The rich structural space of polymorphic oxide systems such as Ga2O3 offers potential for electronic structure engineering, which is of particular interest for a range of applications, such as power electronics. &#947;&#8208;Ga2O3 presents a particular challenge across synthesis, characterization, and theory due to its inherent disorder and resulting complex structure&#8211;electronic&#8208;structure relationship. Here, density functional theory is used in combination with a machine&#8208;learning approach to screen nearly one million potential structures, thereby developing a robust atomistic model of the &#947;&#8208;phase. Theoretical results are compared with surface and bulk sensitive soft and hard X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, spectroscopic ellipsometry, and photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy experiments representative of the occupied and unoccupied states of &#947;&#8208;Ga2O3. The first onset of strong absorption at room temperature is found at 5.1&#160;eV from spectroscopic ellipsometry, which agrees well with the excitation maximum at 5.17&#160;eV obtained by photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy, where the latter shifts to 5.33&#160;eV at 5&#160;K. This work presents a leap forward in the treatment of complex, disordered oxides and is a crucial step toward exploring how their electronic structure can be understood in terms of local coordination and overall structure.

         <title>Determination of Crystallographic Orientation and Exposed Facets of Titanium Oxide Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
TiO2 nanosheets with dominant {001} and {111} facets are identified by transmission electron microscopy, which are very close because of similar morphology and lattice parameters. The importance of the determination of exposed facets, which is the prerequisite of surface performance study, is emphasized and a paradigm applied to all nanocrystalline materials is given.








Abstract
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanocrystals have attracted great attention in heterogeneous photocatalysis and photoelectricity fields for decades. However, contradicting conclusions on the crystallographic orientation and exposed facets of TiO2 nanocrystals frequently appear in the literature. Herein, using anatase TiO2 nanocrystals with highly exposed {001} facets as a model, the misleading conclusions that exist on anatase nanocrystals are clarified. Although TiO2&#8208;001 nanocrystals are recognized to be dominated by {001} facets, in fact, anatase nanocrystals with both dominant {001} and {111} facets always co&#8208;exist due to the similarities in the lattice fringes and intersection angles between the two types of facets (0.38&#160;nm and 90&#176; in the [001] direction, 0.35&#160;nm and 82&#176; in the [111] direction). A paradigm for determining the crystallographic orientation and exposed facets based on transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, which provides a universal methodology to nanomaterials for determining the orientation and exposed facets, is also given.

         <title>Tailoring the Desorption Behavior of Hygroscopic Gels for Atmospheric Water Harvesting in Arid Climates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hygroscopic gel is developed for atmospheric water harvesting in arid climates by integrating a hygroscopic salt, LiCl, with a cross&#8208;linked hydrophilic polymeric network, polyacrylamide. The interactions between the polymer network and the captured water increase the free/weakly bonded water content compared with pure salt sorbent, lowering the desorption heat to achieve a high water yield of &#8776;7&#160;g g&#8722;1 per day in a 20% relative humidity environment.








Abstract
The ubiquitous nature of atmospheric moisture makes it a significant water resource available at any geographical location. Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) technology, which extracts moisture from the ambient air to generate clean water, is a promising strategy to realize decentralized water production. The high water uptake by&#160;salt&#8208;based sorbents makes them attractive for AWH, especially in arid environments. However, they often have relatively high desorption heat, rendering water release an energy&#8208;intensive process. A &#160;LiCl&#8208;incorporating polyacrylamide hydrogel (PAM&#8211;LiCl)&#160;capable of effective moisture harvesting from arid environments is proposed. The interactions between the hydrophilic hydrogel network and the captured water generate more free and weakly bonded water, significantly lowering the desorption heat compared with conventional neat salt sorbents. Benefiting from the affinity for swelling of the polymer backbones, the developed PAM&#8211;LiCl achieves a high water uptake of &#8776;1.1&#160;g&#160;g&#8722;1 at 20%&#160;RH with fast sorption kinetics of &#8776;0.008&#160;g g&#8722;1&#160;min&#8722;1&#160;and further demonstrates a daily water yield up to &#8776;7&#160;g&#160;g&#8722;1 at this condition. These findings provide a new pathway for the synthesis of materials with efficient water absorption/desorption properties, to reach energy&#8208;efficient water release for AWH in arid climates.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ubiquitous nature of atmospheric moisture makes it a significant water resource available at any geographical location. Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) technology, which extracts moisture from the ambient air to generate clean water, is a promising strategy to realize decentralized water production. The high water uptake by&#160;salt-based sorbents makes them attractive for AWH, especially in arid environments. However, they often have relatively high desorption heat, rendering water release an energy-intensive process. A &#160;LiCl-incorporating polyacrylamide hydrogel (PAM&#8211;LiCl)&#160;capable of effective moisture harvesting from arid environments is proposed. The interactions between the hydrophilic hydrogel network and the captured water generate more free and weakly bonded water, significantly lowering the desorption heat compared with conventional neat salt sorbents. Benefiting from the affinity for swelling of the polymer backbones, the developed PAM&#8211;LiCl achieves a high water uptake of &#8776;1.1&#160;g&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 20%&#160;RH with fast sorption kinetics of &#8776;0.008&#160;g g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;and further demonstrates a daily water yield up to &#8776;7&#160;g&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at this condition. These findings provide a new pathway for the synthesis of materials with efficient water absorption/desorption properties, to reach energy-efficient water release for AWH in arid climates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strain&#8208;Driven Mixed&#8208;Phase Domain Architectures and Topological Transitions in Pb1&#8722;xSrxTiO3 Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is numerically and experimentally shown that, by controlling strontium content and in turn manipulating strain, topologically non&#8208;trivial phase arrangements appear in hierarchical, mixed&#8208;phase domains structure of Pb1&#8722;xSrxTiO3. These phases showcase a variety of pattern defects that can be manipulated via thermal treatment. In turn, the dielectric response, which is strongly correlated with domain structure, can be widely varied.








Abstract
The potential for creating hierarchical domain structures, or mixtures of energetically degenerate phases with distinct patterns that can be modified continually, in ferroelectric thin films offers a pathway to control their mesoscale structure beyond lattice&#8208;mismatch strain with a substrate. Here, it is demonstrated that varying the strontium content provides deterministic strain&#8208;driven control of hierarchical domain structures in Pb1&#8722;xSrxTiO3&#160;solid&#8208;solution thin films wherein two types, c/a and a1/a2, of nanodomains can coexist. Combining phase&#8208;field simulations, epitaxial thin&#8208;film growth, detailed structural, domain, and physical&#8208;property characterization, it is observed that the system undergoes a gradual transformation (with increasing strontium content) from droplet&#8208;like a1/a2&#160;domains in a c/a domain matrix, to a connected&#8208;labyrinth geometry of c/a domains, to a disconnected labyrinth structure of the same, and, finally, to droplet&#8208;like c/a domains in an a1/a2&#160;domain matrix. A relationship between the different mixed&#8208;phase modulation patterns and its topological nature is established. Annealing the connected&#8208;labyrinth structure leads to domain coarsening forming distinctive regions of parallel c/a and a1/a2&#160;domain stripes, offering additional design flexibility. Finally, it is found that the connected&#8208;labyrinth domain patterns exhibit the highest dielectric permittivity.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Regulated Electrostatic Shielding Layer toward Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building stable electrolytes is very crucial for constructing stable Zn batteries as hydrogen reaction and the dendritic growth of Zn&#8208;metal anodes. Here, a rare metal salts additive (CeCl3) is employed to stabilize the electrolyte in Zn batteries via the formation of a self&#8208;regulated electrostatic shielding layer. The rare metal salts additive strategy affords emerging chances for rational electrolyte design for stable Zn batteries.








Abstract
Although aqueous Zn batteries have become a more sustainable alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries owing to their intrinsic security, their practical applications are limited by dendrite formation and hydrogen reactions. The first application of a rare earth metal type addition to Zn batteries, cerium chloride (CeCl3), as an effective, low&#8208;cost, and green electrolyte additive that facilitates the formation of a dynamic electrostatic shielding layer around the Zn protuberance to induce uniform Zn deposition is presented. After introducing CeCl3 additives, the electrochemical characterizations, in situ optical microscopy observation, in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry, along with density functional theory calculations, and finite element method simulations reveal resisted Zn dendritic growth and enhanced electrolyte stability. As a result, the Zn&#8211;Zn cells using the CeCl3 additive exhibit a long cycling stability of 2600 h at 2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, an impressive cumulative areal capacity of 3.6 Ah cm&#8722;2 at 40&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and a high Coulombic efficiency of &#8776;99.7%. The fact that the Zn&#8211;LiFePO4 cells with proposed electrolyte retain capacity significantly better than the additive&#8208;free case is even more exciting.

Metasurfaces
A self&#8208;aligned suspended chiral bilayer metasurface via single&#8208;step electron&#8208;beam lithography is reported by Tun Cao, Yan Jun Liu, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2203956. A huge optical chirality of 221&#176; &#956;m&#8722;1 is achieved by the free&#8208;standing metasurfaces with overall thickness of 100 nm. The bilayer metasurface demonstrates label&#8208;free discrimination of chiral molecules at zeptomole level, with sensitivity orders of magnitude larger than conventional circular dichroism spectroscopy.

         <title>Surface Lattice Plasmon Resonances by Direct In Situ Substrate Growth of Gold Nanoparticles in Ordered Arrays (Adv. Mater. 37/2022)</title>

Plasmonic Arrays
In article number 2205330, Leonardo Scarabelli and co&#8208;workers report on the in situ growth of gold nanoparticle plasmonic ordered arrays. In situ growth is an unconventional fabrication approach where gold precursors are reduced directly at specific chemically patterned areas on the substrate. Taking advantage of bottom&#8208;up wet&#8208;chemistry synthesis principles, nanoparticle morphology and array periodicity can be easily tuned using this method. The plasmonic arrays display narrow lattice plasmon resonances, constituting a major step forward for this class of techniques.

&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202205330"&gt;2205330&lt;/a&gt;, Leonardo Scarabelli and co-workers report on the in situ growth of gold nanoparticle plasmonic ordered arrays. In situ growth is an unconventional fabrication approach where gold precursors are reduced directly at specific chemically patterned areas on the substrate. Taking advantage of bottom-up wet-chemistry synthesis principles, nanoparticle morphology and array periodicity can be easily tuned using this method. The plasmonic arrays display narrow lattice plasmon resonances, constituting a major step forward for this class of techniques.

Dendrite Regulation
In article number 2203835, Liqun Wang, Feng Hou, Ji Liang, and co&#8208;workers present Cu nanowires that have regularly exposed (111) planes at the edges, which induces tiny, homogeneously distributed, and uniform Zn dendrites by matching Zn(002)/Cu(111) facets. This dendrite regulation strategy is extremely effective in improving Zn&#8208;anode reversibility in ultrahigh current densities and promising in stabilizing other metal species as well.

Microbial Electrosynthesis
Microbial electrosynthesis holds the promise of sustainable chemical production. In article number 2203480, Guillermo C. Bazan and co&#8208;workers show that 3D living biocomposites integrating electroactive bacteria with an n&#8208;type conjugated polyelectrolyte allow efficient long&#8208;range electron transfer from electrode to living cells, thereby enabling microbial electrosynthesis. The one&#8208;step self&#8208;assembly process offers a simple and effective strategy to improve bioelectrochemical systems.

         <dc:description>
Liquid metals (LMs) with good biosafety, deformability, functionalizability, and stimulus responsiveness have great potential in biomedicine. Here, the advantages of LMs are presented. Recent advances in the design and application of LM&#8208;based biomaterials are comprehensively summarized to provide deep insights into structure&#8211;property relationships and guide their on&#8208;demand design and performance optimization for therapeutics, bioimaging, biosensors, and tissue repair.








Abstract
Liquid metals (LMs) as emerging biomaterials possess unique advantages including their favorable biosafety, high fluidity, and excellent electrical and thermal conductivities, thus providing a unique platform for a wide range of biomedical applications ranging from drug delivery, tumor therapy, and bioimaging to biosensors. The structural design and functionalization of LMs endow them with enhanced functions such as enhanced targeting ability and stimuli responsiveness, enabling them to achieve better and even multifunctional synergistic therapeutic effects. Herein, the advantages of LMs in biomedicine are presented. The design of LM&#8208;based biomaterials with different scales ranging from micro&#8208;/nanoscale to macroscale and various components is explored in&#8208;depth to promote the understanding of structure&#8211;property relationships, guiding their performance optimization and applications. Furthermore, the related advanced progress in the development of LM&#8208;based biomaterials in biomedicine is summarized. Current challenges and prospects of LMs in the biomedical field are also discussed.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Mimicking Nanoparticles in Biosystems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic protein&#8208;mimicking properties of nanoparticles (NPs) have great potential in biological and biomedical applications. Representative categories of protein&#8208;mimicking NPs that act as mimics of enzymes, mimics of fluorescent proteins, interacting partners of specific proteins or DNA sequences, and mimics of protein scaffolds in biosystems are summarized.








Abstract
Proteins are essential elements for almost all life activities. The emergence of nanotechnology offers innovative strategies to create a diversity of nanoparticles (NPs) with intrinsic capacities of mimicking the functions of proteins. These artificial mimics are produced in a cost&#8208;efficient and controllable manner, with their protein&#8208;mimicking performances comparable or superior to those of natural proteins. Moreover, they can be endowed with additional functionalities that are absent in natural proteins, such as cargo loading, active targeting, membrane penetrating, and multistimuli responding. Therefore, protein&#8208;mimicking NPs have been utilized more and more often in biosystems for a wide range of applications including detection, imaging, diagnosis, and therapy. To highlight recent progress in this broad field, herein, representative protein&#8208;mimicking NPs that fall into one of the four distinct categories are summarized: mimics of enzymes (nanozymes), mimics of fluorescent proteins, NPs with high affinity binding to specific proteins or DNA sequences, and mimics of protein scaffolds. This review covers their subclassifications, characteristic features, functioning mechanisms, as well as the extensive exploitation of their great potential for biological and biomedical purposes. Finally, the challenges and prospects in future development of protein&#8208;mimicking NPs are discussed.

Abstract
Molecular structuring of soft matter with precise arrangements over multiple hierarchical levels, especially on polymer surfaces, and enabling their post&#8208;synthetic modulation has tremendous potential for application in molecular engineering and interfacial science.

         <title>Atomically Thin, Ionic&#8211;Covalent Organic Nanosheets for Stable, High&#8208;Performance Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The methylation of cobalt&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic nanosheets successfully introduces quaternary ammonium groups into the framework, and resolves the leaching problem of ionic catalysts. The steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion effect of ammonium groups benefit the formation of monolayer nanosheets and the exposure of active sites. Meanwhile, the cationic skeleton decreases the energy barrier for the *COOH formation and facilitates electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion.








Abstract
The incorporation of charged functional groups is effective to modulate the activity of molecular complexes for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), yet long&#8208;term heterogeneous electrolysis is often hampered by catalyst leaching. Herein, an electrocatalyst of atomically thin, cobalt&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based, ionic&#8211;covalent organic nanosheets (CoTAP&#8208;iCONs) is synthesized via a post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy for high&#8208;performance CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. The cationic quaternary ammonium groups not only enable the formation of monolayer nanosheets due to steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion, but also facilitate the formation of a *COOH intermediate, as suggested by theoretical calculations. Consequently, CoTAP&#8208;iCONs exhibit higher CO2RR activity than other cobalt&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based structures: an 870% and 480% improvement of CO current densities compared to the monomer and neutral nanosheets, respectively. Additionally, the iCONs structure can accommodate the cationic moieties. In a flow cell, CoTAP&#8208;iCONs attain a very small onset overpotential of 40&#160;mV and a stable total current density of 212&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8211;2 with CO Faradaic efficiency of &gt;95% at &#8722;0.6&#160;V for 11&#160;h. Further coupling the flow electrolyzer with commercial solar cells yields a solar&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion efficiency of 13.89%. This work indicates that atom&#8208;thin, ionic nanosheets represent a promising structure for achieving both tailored activity and high stability.

         <title>Overcoming the Limitations of MXene Electrodes for Solution&#8208;Processed Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently, various applications of MXenes have been intensively explored, except for optoelectronics, in which poor environmental stability severely impedes their practical application. This work provides a simple but effective approach to develop an environmentally stable MXene electrode that exhibits a high work function of 5.84 eV and distinguished solution processibility as the electrode for large&#8208;area organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.








Abstract
MXenes constitute a rapidly growing family of 2D materials that are promising for optoelectronic applications because of numerous attractive properties, including high electrical conductivity. However, the most widely used titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx) MXene transparent conductive electrode exhibits insufficient environmental stability and work function (WF), which impede practical applications Ti3C2Tx electrodes in solution&#8208;processed optoelectronics. Herein, Ti3C2Tx MXene film with a compact structure and a perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) barrier layer is presented as a promising electrode for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The electrode shows excellent environmental stability, high WF of 5.84&#160;eV, and low sheet resistance RS of 97.4&#160;&#937;&#160;sq&#8722;1. The compact Ti3C2Tx structure after thermal annealing resists intercalation of moisture and environmental contaminants. In addition, the PFSA surface modification passivates interflake defects and modulates the WF. Thus, changes in the WF and RS are negligible even after 22&#160;days of exposure to ambient air. The Ti3C2Tx MXene is applied for large&#8208;area, 10&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#160;passive matrix flexible OLEDs on substrates measuring 6&#160;&#215;&#160;6&#160;cm. This work provides a simple but efficient strategy to overcome both the limited environmental stability and low WF of MXene electrodes for solution&#8208;processable optoelectronics.

         <title>Molecularly Engineered Unparalleled Strength and Super Toughness Poly(urea&#8208;urethane) with Shape Memory and Clusterization&#8208;triggered Emission</title>

Abstract
To address the challenge of realizing multifunctional polymers simultaneously exhibiting high strength and high toughness through molecular engineering, we fabricated ultra&#8208;strong and super&#8208;tough shape memory poly(urea&#8208;urethane)s by regulating (i) the reversible cross&#8208;links composed of rigid units and multiple hydrogen bonds and (ii) the molecular weight of soft segments. The optimal material exhibited an unparalleled strength of 84.2&#160;MPa at a large elongation at break of 925.6%, a superior toughness of 322.8&#160;MJ m&#8722;3, and remarkable fatigue resistance without fracture. The repeated stretching of this material induced an irreversible deformation, which, however, could be rapidly recovered by heating. Moreover, all samples were capable of temporary shape fixation at &#8722;40&#176;C (recovering the original shape at 30&#176;C) and exhibited blue fluorescence when excited at the optimum wavelength, which was ascribed to clusterization&#8208;triggered emission due to the formation of microphase separation structures. Thus, the adopted approach provides a solution to a long&#8208;standing problem and paves the way to the realization of intrinsically luminescent shape memory materials exhibiting both ultrahigh strength and ultrahigh toughness.

         <title>Bimetallic Rechargeable Al/Zn Hybrid Aqueous Batteries Based on Al&#8208;Zn Alloys with Composite Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Aluminium is abundant and exhibits a high theoretical capacity and volumetric energy density. Additionally, the high safety of aqueous aluminium&#8208;ion batteries makes them strong candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage systems. However, the frequent collapse of the cathode material and passive oxide film result in difficult development of aqueous aluminium&#8208;ion batteries. This work provides a novel battery system, namely, Al&#8208;Zn/Al(OTF)3+HOTF+Zn(OTF)2/AlxZnyMnO2&#183;nH2O, with a mixed electrolyte. The cathode applies MnO topology transformation to ensure that the cathode forms AlxMnO2&#183;nH2O. Topology transformation alters the structure of the cathode material so that Zn2+ can be intercalated into the AlxMnO2&#183;nH2O spinel structure to provide support for the material structure. Regarding the anode, Zn2+ in the electrolyte is deposited onto Al of the anode to produce a regional Al&#8208;Zn alloy.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aluminium is abundant and exhibits a high theoretical capacity and volumetric energy density. Additionally, the high safety of aqueous aluminium-ion batteries makes them strong candidates for large-scale energy storage systems. However, the frequent collapse of the cathode material and passive oxide film result in difficult development of aqueous aluminium-ion batteries. This work provides a novel battery system, namely, Al-Zn/Al(OTF)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;+HOTF+Zn(OTF)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Al&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;nH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, with a mixed electrolyte. The cathode applies MnO topology transformation to ensure that the cathode forms Al&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;nH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Topology transformation alters the structure of the cathode material so that Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; can be intercalated into the Al&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;nH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O spinel structure to provide support for the material structure. Regarding the anode, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the electrolyte is deposited onto Al of the anode to produce a regional Al-Zn alloy. Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is reduced to Zn metal during discharging, which adds a platform for secondary discharge beneficial for battery capacity enhancement. This system can provide a 1.6&#160;V discharge platform, while the first cycle discharge can reach 554 mAh/g, thereby maintaining a high capacity of 313 mAh/g after 100 cycles. This study provides a new idea for the further development of aqueous aluminium-ion batteries (AAIBs).&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Construction of Active Protein Materials: Manipulation on Morphology of Salmon Calcitonin Assemblies with Enhanced Bone Regeneration Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The effect of protein drugs is always limited by their relatively low stability and fast degradation property, thus various elegant efforts have been made to improve the bioactivity and biocompatibility of the protein drugs. In this paper, we propose an alternative way to solve this problem. By simply adding a limited amount of small molecular regulator, which tunes the subtle balance of protein&#8208;protein interactions and disulfide bond formation, the self&#8208;assembly property of the protein drug could be regulated, forming an active protein material itself. This means that, the resulting biomaterial is dominated by the protein drug and water, with significantly enhanced bone regeneration effect compared to the virgin protein in vitro and in vivo, through multivalent effect between the protein and receptor and the retarded degradation of the assembled proteins. In this active protein material, the protein drug is not only the active drug, but also the drug carrier, which greatly increased the drug&#8208;loading efficiency of the biomaterial, indicating the advantages of easy preparation, high efficiency and low cost of the active protein material with bright future in biomedical applications.

         <title>Lithium Metal Batteries: From Fundamental Research to Industrialization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are representative of post&#8208;lithium&#8208;ion batteries with the great promise of increasing the energy density drastically by utilizing the low operating voltage and high specific capacity of metallic lithium. LMBs currently stand at a point of transition at which the accumulation of knowledge from fundamental research is being translated into large&#8208;scale commercialization. This review summarizes the available strategies for addressing the intrinsic shortcomings of LMBs, such as the suppression of dendritic growth and parasitic reactions from the material to the electrode to the cell level. The discussion pertaining to the cell level includes efforts and concerns relating to scaling up established knowledge and expertise with the view of commercialization. This article intends to encourage researchers in both fundamental research institutions and industry to make a synergistic effort and share their views comprehensively to ensure that LMB technology continues to evolve in harmony to become a mature technology.

         <title>Observation of Superconducting Collective Modes from Competing Pairing Instabilities in Single&#8208;Layer NbSe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The experimental observation of Leggett collective modes in the superconducting state of a 2D transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) is reported. Leggett modes have been rarely seen in nature and represent the first type of collective modes observed in 2D TMD superconductors, which highlights the rather unconventional superconducting properties of this family of materials in the single&#8208;layer limit.








Abstract
In certain unconventional superconductors with sizable electronic correlations, the availability of closely competing pairing channels leads to characteristic soft collective fluctuations of the order parameters, which leave fingerprints in many observables and allow the phase competition to be scrutinized. Superconducting layered materials, where electron&#8211;electron interactions are enhanced with decreasing thickness, are promising candidates to display these correlation effects. In this work, the existence of a soft collective mode in single&#8208;layer NbSe2, observed as a characteristic resonance excitation in high&#8208;resolution tunneling spectra is reported. This resonance is observed along with higher harmonics, its frequency &#937;/2&#916;&#160;is anticorrelated with the local superconducting gap &#916;, and its amplitude gradually vanishes by increasing the temperature and upon applying a magnetic field up to the critical values (TC and HC2), which sets an unambiguous link to the superconducting state. Aided by a microscopic model that captures the main experimental observations, this resonance is interpreted as a collective Leggett mode that represents the fluctuation toward a proximate f&#8208;wave triplet state, due to subleading attraction in the triplet channel. These findings demonstrate the fundamental role of correlations in superconducting 2D transition metal dichalcogenides, opening a path toward unconventional superconductivity in simple, scalable, and transferable 2D superconductors.

         <title>Inverse Design of Mechanical Metamaterials with Target Nonlinear Response via a Neural Accelerated Evolution Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Materials with target nonlinear mechanical response can support the design of innovative soft robots, wearable devices, footwear, and energy&#8208;absorbing systems, yet it is challenging to realize them. In this work, a neural network is combined with an evolution strategy to efficiently identify geometries resulting in a wide range of target nonlinear mechanical responses and design optimized energy&#8208;absorbing systems, soft robots, and morphing structures.








Abstract
Materials with target nonlinear mechanical response can support the design of innovative soft robots, wearable devices, footwear, and energy&#8208;absorbing systems, yet it is challenging to realize them. Here, mechanical metamaterials based on hinged quadrilaterals are used as a platform to realize target nonlinear mechanical responses. It is first shown that by changing the shape of the quadrilaterals, the amount of internal rotations induced by the applied compression can be tuned, and a wide range of mechanical responses is achieved. Next, a neural network is introduced that provides a computationally inexpensive relationship between the parameters describing the geometry and the corresponding stress&#8211;strain response. Finally, it is shown that by combining the neural network with an evolution strategy, one can efficiently identify geometries resulting in a wide range of target nonlinear mechanical responses and design optimized energy&#8208;absorbing systems, soft robots, and morphing&#160;structures.

         <title>Stabilization of Perovskite Solar Cells: Recent Developments and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Exceptional power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.7% in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has been achieved, which is comparable with their traditional rivals (Si&#8208;based solar cells). However, commercialization&#8208;worthy efficiency and long&#8208;term stability remain a challenge. In this regard, there are increasing studies focusing on the interface engineering in the PSC devices to overcome their poor technical readiness. Herein, we discuss the roles of electrode materials and interfaces in PSCs in terms of their PCEs and perovskite stability. We present all the current knowledge on the factors responsible for the rapid intrinsic and external degradation of PSCs. Then, we focus on the roles of carbonaceous materials as substitutes for noble metals, along with the recent research progress in carbon&#8208;based PSCs. Furthermore, a sub&#8208;category of PSCs, i.e., flexible PSCs, is considered exceptional power sources due to their high power&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratios and figures of merit for next&#8208;generation wearable electronics. Last, we discuss the future perspectives and directions for research in PSCs, with an emphasis on their commercialization.

A pH&#8208;responsive metal&#8211;organic framework nanoparticle responsively removes hydrophilic compositions with steric hindrance and exposes the hydrophobic part in situ, forming clustering nanoparticles with enhanced tumor accumulation and therapeutic effects.








Abstract
As a result of the deficient tumor&#8208;specific antigens, potential off&#8208;target effect, and influence of protein corona, metal&#8211;organic framework nanoparticles have inadequate accumulation in tumor tissues, limiting their therapeutic effects. In this work, a pH&#8208;responsive linker (L) is prepared by covalently modifying oleylamine (OA) with 3&#8208;(bromomethyl)&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;furandione (MMfu) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). Then, the L is embedded into a solid lipid nanoshell to coat apilimod (Ap)&#8208;loaded zeolitic imidazolate framework (Ap&#8208;ZIF) to form Ap&#8208;ZIF@SLN#L. Under the tumor microenvironment, the hydrophilic PEG and MMfu are removed, exposing the hydrophobic OA on Ap&#8208;ZIF@SLN#L, increasing their uptake in cancer cells and accumulation in the tumor. The ZIF@SLN#L nanoparticle induces reactive oxygen species (ROS). Ap released from Ap&#8208;ZIF@SLN#L significantly promotes intracellular ROS and lactate dehydrogenase generation. Ap&#8208;ZIF@SLN#L inhibits tumor growth, increases the survival rate in mice, activates the tumor microenvironment, and improves the infiltration of macrophages and T cells in the tumor, as demonstrated in two different tumor&#8208;bearing mice after injections with Ap&#8208;ZIF@SLN#TL. Furthermore, mice show normal tissue structure&#160;of the main organs and the normal serum level in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase after treatment with the nanoparticles. Overall, this pH&#8208;responsive targeting strategy improves nanoparticle accumulation in tumors with enhanced therapeutic effects.

         <title>Boosting oxygen&#8208;evolving activity via atom&#8208;stepped interfaces architected with kinetic frustration</title>

Abstract
A highly active interface is extremely critical for the catalytic efficiency of an electrocatalyst, however, facilely tailoring its atomic packing characteristics remains challenging. Herein, we report a simple yet effective strategy to obtain copious high&#8208;energy atomic steps at the interface via controlling the solidification behavior of glass&#8208;forming metallic liquids. By adjusting the chemical composition and cooling rate, highly faceted FeNi3 nanocrystals were in&#8208;situ formed in a Fe&#8208;Ni&#8208;B metallic glass (MG) matrix, leading to the creation of order/disorder interfaces. Benefiting from the catalytically active and stable atomic steps at the jagged interfaces, the resultant free&#8208;standing FeNi3 nanocrystal/MG composite exhibits a low oxygen&#8208;evolving overpotential of 214&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, a small Tafel slope of 32.4&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 and good stability in alkaline media, outperforming most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. Our approach is based on the manipulation of nucleation and crystal growth of the solid&#8208;solution nanophases (e.g., FeNi3) in glass&#8208;forming liquids, so that the highly stepped interface architecture can be obtained due to the kinetic frustration effect in MGs upon undercooling. We envisage that the atomic&#8208;level stepped interface engineering via the physical metallurgy method can be easily extended to other MG systems, providing a new and generic paradigm for designing efficient yet cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts.

         <title>Probing the Spin Dimensionality in Single&#8208;Layer CrSBr Van Der Waals Heterostructures by Magneto&#8208;Transport Measurements</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magneto&#8208;transport properties of 2D CrSBr vertical van der Waals heterostructures are inspected, revealing a spontaneous spin alignment along the b&#8208;axis together with spin&#8208;reorientation and field&#8208;induced phases. In multilayers, a spin&#8208;valve behavior is observed with large negative magnetoresistance. This makes CrSBr of high interest not only as a new 2D magnetic model but also as a potential spintronic component.








Abstract
2D magnetic materials offer unprecedented opportunities for fundamental and applied research in spintronics and magnonics. Beyond the pioneering studies on 2D CrI3 and Cr2Ge2Te6, the field has expanded to 2D antiferromagnets exhibiting different spin anisotropies and textures. Of particular interest is the layered metamagnet CrSBr, a relatively air&#8208;stable semiconductor formed by antiferromagnetically&#8208;coupled ferromagnetic layers (Tc&#8764;150 K) that can be exfoliated down to the single&#8208;layer. It presents a complex magnetic behavior with a dynamic magnetic crossover, exhibiting a low&#8208;temperature hidden&#8208;order below T*&#8764;40 K. Here, the magneto&#8208;transport properties of CrSBr vertical heterostructures in the 2D limit are inspected. The results demonstrate the marked low&#8208;dimensional character of the ferromagnetic monolayer, with short&#8208;range correlations above Tc and an Ising&#8208;type in&#8208;plane anisotropy, being the spins spontaneously aligned along the easy axis b below Tc. By applying moderate magnetic fields along a and c axes, a spin&#8208;reorientation occurs, leading to a magnetoresistance enhancement below T*. In multilayers, a spin&#8208;valve behavior is observed, with negative magnetoresistance strongly enhanced along the three directions below T*. These results show that CrSBr monolayer/bilayer provides an ideal platform for studying and controlling field&#8208;induced phenomena in two&#8208;dimensions, offering new insights regarding 2D magnets and their integration into vertical spintronic devices.

         <title>Ethylene Carbonate&#8208;Free Electrolytes for Rechargeable Li&#8208;Ion Pouch Cells at Subfreezing Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Subfreezing temperature presents a significant challenge to the survival of current Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) as it leads to low capacity retention and poor cell rechargeability. The electrolyte in commercial LIBs relies too heavily on ethylene carbonate (EC) to produce stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on graphite (Gr) anodes, but its high melting point (36.4&#176;C) severely restricts ion transport below 0&#176;C, causing energy loss and Li plating. Here we&#160; report a class of EC&#8208;free electrolytes that exhibit remarkable low&#8208;temperature performance without compromising cell lifespan. It is found that at sub&#8208;zero temperatures, EC forms highly resistive SEI that seriously impedes electrode kinetics, whereas EC&#8208;free electrolytes create highly stable, low&#8208;impedance SEI through anion decomposition that boosts capacity retention and eliminates Li plating during charging. Pouch&#8208;type LiCoO2 (LCO) | Gr cells with EC&#8208;free electrolytes sustain 900 cycles at 25&#176;C with 1 C charge/discharge, and LiNi0.85Co0.10Al0.05O2 (NCA) | Gr cells last 300 cycles at &#8722;15&#176;C with 0.3 C charge, both among the best&#8208;performing in literature under comparable conditions. Even at &#8722;50&#176;C, the NCA | Gr cell with EC&#8208;free electrolytes still delivers 76% of its room&#8208;temperature capacity, outperforming EC&#8208;based electrolytes.

         <title>All&#8208;Polymer Bulk&#8208;Heterojunction Organic Electrochemical Transistors with Balanced Ionic and Electronic Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;polymer bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) with good ambipolar property is achieved through the blending of a new p&#8208;type ladder polymer and a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art n&#8208;type ladder polymer. The concept of the BHJ provides a facile strategy to develop ambipolar OECTs with balanced electron and hole transport, and ultimately to achieve high amplification and easy scaling for integrated circuits.








Abstract
The rapid development of organic electrochemical transistor (OECTs)&#8208;based circuits brings new opportunities for next&#8208;generation integrated bioelectronics. The all&#8208;polymer bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) offers an attractive, inexpensive alternative to achieve efficient ambipolar OECTs, and building blocks of logic circuits constructed from them, but have not been investigated to date. Here, the first all&#8208;polymer BHJ&#8208;based OECTs are reported, consisting of a blend of new p&#8208;type ladder conjugated polymer and a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art n&#8208;type ladder polymer. The whole ladder&#8208;type polymer BHJ also proves that side chains are not necessary for good ion transport. Instead, the polymer nanostructures play a critical role in the ion penetration and transportation and thus in the device performance. It also provides a facile strategy and simplifies the fabrication process, forgoing the need to pattern multiple active layers. In addition, the development of complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS)&#8208;like OECTs allows the pursuit of advanced functional logic circuitry, including inverters and NAND gates, as well as for amplifying electrophysiology signals. This work opens a new approach to the design of new materials for OECTs and will contribute to the development of organic heterojunctions for ambipolar OECTs toward high&#8208;performing logic circuits.

&lt;p&gt;An all-polymer bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) with good ambipolar property is achieved through the blending of a new p-type ladder polymer and a state-of-the-art n-type ladder polymer. The concept of the BHJ provides a facile strategy to develop ambipolar OECTs with balanced electron and hole transport, and ultimately to achieve high amplification and easy scaling for integrated circuits.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Negative Differential Resistance and High Tunneling Current Density in GeSn Esaki Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Negative differential resistance (NDR) in GeSn Esaki diodes at room temperature with very high peak&#8208;to&#8208;valley current ratios is reported. By applying tensile stresses on GeSn epitaxial films, a record&#8208;high tunneling current density of 0.5 MA cm&#8722;2 is achieved among all group&#8208;IV Esaki diodes since phonon participation is no longer required in direct&#8208;bandgap germanium&#8211;tin.








Abstract
Tunnel field&#8208;effect transistors (TFETs) are a promising candidate for low&#8208;power applications owing to their steep subthreshold swing of sub&#8208;60 mV per decade. For silicon&#8208; or germanium&#8208;based TFETs, the drive current is low due to the indirect band&#8208;to&#8208;band tunneling (BTBT) process. Direct&#8208;bandgap germanium&#8211;tin (GeSn) can boost the TFET performance since phonon participation is not required during the tunneling process. Esaki diodes with negative differential resistance (NDR) are used to characterize the BTBT properties and calibrate the tunneling rates for TFET applications. This work demonstrates high&#8208;performance GeSn Esaki diodes with clear NDR at room temperature with very high peak&#8208;to&#8208;valley current ratios of 15&#8211;53 from 300 K to 4 K. A record&#8208;high peak current density of 545 kA cm&#8722;2 at 4 K is also reported for the tensile&#8208;strained Ge0.925Sn0.075 device (strain &#8776;0.6 %). By applying tensile stresses to n&#8208;GeSn epitaxial films, the direct BTBT process dominates, leading to high tunneling rates. Hall measurements further confirm that more electrons populate in the direct &#915; valley in the tensile&#8208;strained n&#8208;GeSn epitaxial&#160;films.

         <title>Augmented DNA Nano&#8208;Architectures: A Structural Library of 3D Self&#8208;Assembling Tensegrity Triangle Variants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The DNA tensegrity triangle is known to reliably self&#8208;assemble into a 3D rhombohedral crystalline lattice via sticky&#8208;end cohesion. Here, we expand the library of accessible motifs through (1) covalent extensions of inter&#8208;triangle regions and (2) sticky&#8208;end coordinated linkages of adjacent triangles with double helical segments using both geometrically symmetric and asymmetric configurations. We report the molecular structures of eighteen self&#8208;assembled architectures at resolutions of 3.32&#8208;9.32 &#197;; the observed cell dimensions, cavity sizes, and cross&#8208;sectional areas agree with theoretical expectations. These data demonstrate that fine control over triclinic and rhombohedral crystal parameters and the customizability of more complex 3D DNA lattices are attainable via rational design. We anticipate that augmented DNA architectures may be fine&#8208;tuned for the self&#8208;assembly of designer nano&#8208;cages, guest&#8208;host complexes, and proscriptive 3D nanomaterials, as originally envisioned. Finally, designer asymmetric crystalline building blocks can be seen as a first step toward controlling and encoding information in three dimensions.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Observation of Fracture along Twin Boundary in Boron Carbide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In this study, the observation of fracture behaviors in perfect and twinned B4C crystals via in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) mechanical testing is reported. The crystal structure of the synthesized B4C, composed of B11C icosahedra connected by boron&#8208;deficient C&#8211;&#9633;&#8211;C chains in a chemical formula of B11C3, is determined by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art aberration&#8208;corrected scanning TEM. In situ TEM observations reveal that cracking is preferentially initiated at the TBs in B4C under both indentation and tension loadings. The cracks then propagate along the TBs, thus resulting in the fracture of B4C. These results are consistent with the theoretical calculations that show that TBs have a softening effect on B4C with amorphous bands preferentially nucleated at the TBs. These findings elucidate the atomic arrangement and the role of planar defects in the failure of B4C. Furthermore, they can guide the design of advanced superhard materials via planar defect control.

         <title>Optical Signal Modulation in Photonic Waveguiding Heteroarchitectures with Continuously Variable Visible&#8208;to&#8208;Near&#8208;Infrared Emission Color</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Photonic circuit systems based on optical waveguiding heteroarchitectures have attracted considerable interest owing to their potential to overcome the speed limitation in electronic circuits by modulating the optical signal at the micro&#8208; or nanoscale. However, controlling the parameters, including the wavelength and polarization of the light outcoupling, as well as the sequence among different building blocks, remains a key issue. Herein, we applied supramolecular heteroarchitectures made by phosphorescent organometallic complexes of Pt, Pd, Cu and Au as photonic logic gates that showed continuously variable emission colors from 475&#160;nm to 810&#160;nm, low waveguide losses down to 0.0077&#160;dB &#956;m&#8722;1, and remarkable excitation&#8208;light polarization&#8208;dependent photoluminescence (PL) with anisotropy ratios up to 0.68. The sequences among Pt, Pd, Au and Cu building blocks in the heteroarchitectures were controlled by living supramolecular polymerization or crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly synthetic approaches. The results indicate the prospects for using organometallic complexes and supramolecular synthetic approaches to prepare photonic circuit systems with tunable emission color and controllable sequences between different blocks that achieve modulation of the optical signal in the visible&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral region.

Abstract
Short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) light emission is important for a diverse range of modern applications, such as eye&#8208;safe depth sensing, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), facial recognition, eye tracking, optical communication and health monitoring technologies. However, there is a very limited number of known semiconductors that could emit efficiently in the SWIR spectral range. Presently, SWIR light&#8208;emitting diodes (LED) based on colloidal quantum dots are dominated by lead chalcogenide systems (PbS, PbSe), despite the presence of heavy metal and modest efficiencies. Here, we present a highly&#8208;efficient SWIR LED based on heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free indium arsenide (InAs) core&#8208;shell colloidal quantum dots (CQD). In our LED design, the implementation of an otherwise hole&#8208;transporting poly(vinyl&#8208;carbazole) (PVK) layer on the electron&#8208;injecting side of the device stack led to a surprising enhancement in device performance, giving remarkably high external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of 13.3% at long emission wavelengths of 1006 nm. Single&#8208;carrier device and optical investigations reveal the origins of enhancement to be the electronic decoupling of the CQD layer with the electron&#8208;injecting zinc oxide (ZnO) layer, which mitigated luminescence quenching and improved charge balance. This work marks one of the highest efficiencies reported for heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free solution&#8208;processed LEDs in the SWIR spectral region (&gt;1000 nm), and could find significant applications in emerging consumer electronic technologies.

         <title>A Versatile Molten&#8208;salt Induction Strategy to Achieve Efficient CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells with a High Open&#8208;circuit Voltage &gt;1.2 V</title>

Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite has emerged as an important photovoltaic material due to its high thermal stability and suitable bandgap for tandem devices. Currently, the cell performance of CsPbI3 solar cells is mainly subject to a large open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficit. Herein, we demonstrate a multifunctional room&#8208;temperature molten salt, dimethylamine acetate (DMAAc), which not only directly acts as a solvent for precursor solutions but also regulates the phase conversion process of the CsPbI3 film for high&#8208;efficiency photovoltaics. DMAAc can stabilize the DMAPbI3 structure and eliminate the Cs4PbI6 intermediate phase, which is easily spatially segregated. Meanwhile, a new homogeneous intermediate phase DMAPb(I, Ac)3 is formed, which finally affords high&#8208;quality CsPbI3 films. With this approach, the charge capture activity of defects in the CsPbI3 film is significantly suppressed. Consequently, a VOC (open&#8208;circuit voltage) of 1.25&#160;V and &gt;21% PCE (power conversion efficiency) are achieved, which is the highest record reported thus far. This intermediate phase regulation strategy is believed to be applicable to other perovskite material systems.

Abstract
The development of human&#8208;interactive sensing displays (HISDs) that simultaneously detect and visualize stimuli is important for numerous cutting&#8208;edge human&#8211;machine interface technologies. Therefore, innovative device platforms with optimized architectures of HISDs combined with novel high&#8208;performance sensing and display materials are demonstrated. This study comprehensively reviews the recent advances in HISDs, particularly the device architectures that enable scaling&#8208;down and simplifying the HISD, as well as material designs capable of directly visualizing input information received by various sensors. Various HISD platforms for integrating sensors and displays are described. HISDs consist of a sensor and display connected through a microprocessor, and attempts to assemble the two devices by eliminating the microprocessor are detailed. Single&#8208;device HISD technologies are highlighted in which input stimuli acquired by sensory components are directly visualized with various optical components, such as electroluminescence, mechanoluminescence, and structural color. The review forecasts future HISD technologies that demand the development of materials with molecular&#8208;level synthetic precision that enables simultaneous sensing and visualization. Furthermore, emerging HISDs combined with artificial intelligence technologies and those enabling simultaneous detection and visualization of extrasensory information are discussed.

         <title>A Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Enhanced Simultaneous and Multimodal Sensor Based on Moist&#8208;Electric Powered Graphene Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene oxide multimodal sensor (GO&#8208;MS) capable of self&#8208;powered sensing of various environmental stimuli based on a spontaneously generated moist&#8208;electric potential is developed. Through the decoupling of characteristic response signals by machine&#8208;learning models, simultaneous monitoring of multiple stimuli by a single GO&#8208;MS is realized, providing a promising technical means for real&#8208;time multimodal perception and complex information system identification.








Abstract
Simultaneous multimodal monitoring can greatly perceive intricately multiple stimuli, which is important for the understanding and development of a future human&#8211;machine fusion world. However, the integrated multisensor networks with cumbersome structure, huge power consumption, and complex preparation process have heavily restricted practical applications. Herein, a graphene oxide single&#8208;component multimodal sensor (GO&#8208;MS) is developed, which enables simultaneous monitoring of multiple environmental stimuli by a single unit with unique moist&#8208;electric self&#8208;power supply. This GO&#8208;MS can generate a sustainable moist&#8208;electric potential by spontaneously adsorbing water molecules in air, which has a characteristic response behavior when exposed to different stimuli. As a result, the simultaneous monitoring and decoupling of the changes of temperature, humidity, pressure, and light intensity are achieved by this single GO&#8208;MS with machine&#8208;learning (ML) assistance. Of practical importance, a moist&#8208;electric&#8208;powered human&#8211;machine interaction wristband based on GO&#8208;MS is constructed to monitor pulse signals, body temperature, and sweating in a multidimensional manner, as well as gestures and sign language commanding communication. This ML&#8208;empowered moist&#8208;electric GO&#8208;MS provides a new platform for the development of self&#8208;powered single&#8208;component multimodal sensors, showing great potential for applications in the fields of health detection, artificial electronic skin, and the Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things.

         <title>Unraveling the Mechanisms of the Apis mellifera Honeycomb Construction by 4D X&#8208;ray Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using X&#8208;ray microscopy, a millennium&#8208;old question of how bees build combs is answered. Individual cells are seen to grow out of the spine, which behaves as a substrate from which the hexagonal geometry is directly adopted. Seminal features such as the corrugated spine, coping, and porosities are observed, that further give us significant insights into the comb's construction and properties.








Abstract
Honeycomb is one of nature's best engineered structures. Even though it has inspired several modern engineering structures, an understanding of the process by which the hexagonal cells are formed in 3D space is lacking. Previous studies on the structure of the honeycomb are based on either 2D microscopy or by direct visual observations. As a result, several critical features of its microstructure and the precise mechanisms of its growth are not well understood. Using 4D X&#8208;ray microscopy, this study shows how individual and groups of honeycomb cells are formed. Cells grow additively from a corrugated central spine in a dynamic manner. The previously undocumented, corrugated spine contributes significantly to the comb's robust mechanical properties in all three dimensions. As cells grow, honey bees create a &#8220;coping,&#8221; which this study shows to be the location where new wax material is deposited behind where compaction and densification take place. This is exemplified by pores in the wax observed at the coping and alternating rear junctions between the comb cells that arise from the additive building technique and the highly efficient cell packing methodology, respectively. Additional mechanisms for growth and formation are discussed and described.

         <title>Ionic&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of FeSe&#8211;MnSe Heterointerfaces with Abundant Se Vacancies Embedded in N,B Co&#8208;Doped Hollow Carbon Microspheres for Accelerating the Sulfur Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N,B co&#8208;doped conductive hollow carbon microspheres embedded with dense FeSe&#8211;MnSe heterostructures and abundant Se vacancies are rationally synthesized and used for Li&#8211;S batteries. The catalysts can subtly guide the Li2S nucleation and deposition in the 3D framework, avoiding the formation of L2S passivation layer and leaving enough channels for the continuous Li+ diffusion and subsequent nucleation of Li2S.








Abstract
Currently, extensive research efforts are being devoted to suppressing the shuttle effect of polysulfides. The uncontrollable deposition of insulating Li2S onto the surface of sulfur host materials dramatically inhibits the continuous reduction of polysulfides in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Herein, N,B co&#8208;doped hollow carbon microspheres embedded with dense FeSe&#8211;MnSe heterostructures and abundant Se vacancies (FeSe&#8211;MnSe/NBC) are rationally designed and synthesized via a facile hydrothermal reaction using ionic liquids as dopants. The introduction of abundant heterostructures subtly guides Li2S nucleation and deposition in 3D frameworks, thus avoiding the formation of the Li2S passivation layer and allowing for continuous Li+ diffusion and subsequent nucleation of Li2S. Owing to these beneficial features, Li&#8211;S batteries comprising an FeSe&#8211;MnSe/NBC electrode exhibit significantly improved performance, including a high initial capacity of 1334 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 C and ultralong cycle stability with a low capacity fading rate of 0.029% cycle&#8722;1 over 1000 cycles at 1.0 C. Remarkably, the FeSe&#8211;MnSe/NBC pouch cell delivers a considerable areal capacity of 3.6 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 0.1 C. This study provides valuable insight into heterostructures and Se vacancies for developing practical Li&#8211;S batteries.

&lt;p&gt;N,B co-doped conductive hollow carbon microspheres embedded with dense FeSe&#8211;MnSe heterostructures and abundant Se vacancies are rationally synthesized and used for Li&#8211;S batteries. The catalysts can subtly guide the Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S nucleation and deposition in the 3D framework, avoiding the formation of L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S passivation layer and leaving enough channels for the continuous Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion and subsequent nucleation of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Enabled by Passivating Defect and Constructing Dual Energy Transfer Pathway through Functional Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>

Abstract
Quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;2D) perovskites have emerged as a promising luminescent material for perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (Pe&#8208;LEDs). However, efficiency and stability are still obstacles to practical application due to numerous defects and inefficient energy transfer of perovskite film. Herein, we firstly introduced functional phenethylammonium bromine modified CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (PEA&#8208;CsPbBr3 NCs) as multifunctional additive to simultaneously improve above&#8208;mentioned problems. PEA&#8208;CsPbBr3 NCs not only serves as hetero&#8208;nuclear seeds and triggers growth, thus greatly reducing leakage current, but also deliver Cs+ and Br&#8722; to passivate the intrinsic defects inside film. More importantly, PEA&#8208;CsPbBr3 construct one new carrier transfer pathway from small&#8208;n phase of quasi&#8208;2D perovskite to PEA&#8208;CsPbBr3, which not only accelerates the energy transfer process but also promote radiation recombination of carriers due to stronger quantum confinement effect. Afterward, the PEDOT: PSS/TFB: black phosphorus QDs (BPQDs) double hole transport layer (HTL) is successfully constructed to enhance its carrier injection and charge transport abilities. Consequently, a champion external quantum efficiency of 25.32% and maximal brightness of 128842&#160;cd/m2, which is the record efficiency of the quasi&#8208;2D Pe&#8208;LED with pure green emission at 530&#160;nm. Moreover, an impressive 174&#160;min lifetime was obtained at T50, which is about 5 times longer than the control device.

         <title>Molecularly Engineered Protein Glues with Superior Adhesion Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of protein complex glues with outstanding adhesion performance is fabricated by molecular engineering. The encoded arginine moieties significantly strengthen multiple molecular interactions in the protein complex, leading to ultrastrong adhesion, outperforming many chemically reacted and biomimetic glues. The combined robust interfacial adhesion and superior antibacterial activity endow the materials as highly favorable for visceral hemostasis and tissue regeneration.








Abstract
Naturally inspired proteins are investigated for the development of bioglues that combine adhesion performance and biocompatibility for biomedical applications. However, engineering such adhesives by rational design of the proteins at the molecular level is rarely reported. Herein, it is shown that a new generation of protein&#8208;based glues is generated by supramolecular assembly through de novo designed structural proteins in which arginine triggers robust liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation. The encoded arginine moieties significantly strengthen multiple molecular interactions in the complex, leading to ultrastrong adhesion on various surfaces, outperforming many chemically reacted and biomimetic glues. Such adhesive materials enable quick visceral hemostasis in 10 s and outstanding tissue regeneration due to their robust adhesion, good biocompatibility, and superior antibacterial capacity. Remarkably, their minimum inhibitory concentrations are orders of magnitude lower than clinical antibiotics. These advances offer insights into molecular engineering of de novo designed protein glues and outline a general strategy to fabricate mechanically strong protein&#8208;based materials for surgical applications.

         <title>MoSe2&#8211;VSe2&#8211;NbSe2 Ternary Alloy Nanosheets to Boost Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MoSe2&#8211;VSe2&#8211;NbSe2 ternary alloy nanosheets are synthesized via a colloidal reaction. Ternary alloying produces a miscible phase over a wide range. Compared to each binary alloy, the ternary alloys display higher electrocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an acidic electrolyte. Spin&#8208;polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations consistently predict the homogenous atomic distributions and support that ternary alloying greatly enhances the HER performance.








Abstract
Alloying of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is a pioneering method for engineering electronic structures with expanded applications. In this study, MoSe2&#8211;VSe2&#8211;NbSe2 ternary alloy nanosheets are synthesized via a colloidal reaction. The composition is successfully tuned over a wide range to adjust the 2H&#8211;1T phase transition. The alloy nanosheets consist of miscible atomic structures at all compositions, which is distinct from immiscible binary alloys. Compared to each binary alloy, the ternary alloys display higher electrocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an acidic electrolyte. The HER performance exhibits a volcano&#8208;type composition dependence, which is correlated with the experimental d&#8208;band center (&#949;d). Spin&#8208;polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations consistently predict the homogenous atomic distributions. The Gibbs free energy of H adsorption (&#916;GH*) and the activation barrier (Ea) support that miscible ternary alloying greatly enhances the HER performance.

         <title>Cationic Polysaccharide Conjugates as Antibiotic Adjuvants Resensitize Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Bacteria and Prevent Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic polysaccharide conjugates (Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSSn) are synthesized using controllable disulfide exchange polymerization as antibiotic adjuvants to treat multidrug&#8208;resistant Acinetobacter baumannii&#8208;induced pneumonia in mice. Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSSn disrupts bacterial membranes and efflux pumps, and facilitates antibiotic accumulation inside bacteria. Antibiotic efficacy is restored and bacterial resistance is prevented by Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSSn.








Abstract
In recent years, traditional antibiotic efficacy has rapidly diminished due to the advent of multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) bacteria, which poses severe threat to human life and globalized healthcare. Currently, the development cycle of new antibiotics cannot match the ongoing MDR infection crisis. Therefore, novel strategies are required to resensitize MDR bacteria to existing antibiotics. In this study, novel cationic polysaccharide conjugates Dextran&#8208;graft&#8208;poly(5&#8208;(1,2&#8208;dithiolan&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;N&#8208;(2&#8208;guanidinoethyl)pentanamide) (Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSSn) is synthesized using disulfide exchange polymerization. Critically, bacterial membranes and efflux pumps are disrupted by a sub&#8208;inhibitory concentration of Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSS30, which enhances rifampicin (RIF) accumulation inside bacteria and restores its efficacy. Combined Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSS30 and RIF prevents bacterial resistance in bacteria cultured over 30 generations. Furthermore, Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSS30 restores RIF effectiveness, reduces inflammatory reactions in a pneumonia&#8208;induced mouse model, and exhibits excellent in vivo biological absorption and degradation capabilities. As an antibiotic adjuvant, Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSS30 provides a novel resensitizing strategy for RIF against MDR bacteria and bacterial resistance. This Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSS30 research provides a solid platform for future MDR applications.

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, traditional antibiotic efficacy has rapidly diminished due to the advent of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, which poses severe threat to human life and globalized healthcare. Currently, the development cycle of new antibiotics cannot match the ongoing MDR infection crisis. Therefore, novel strategies are required to resensitize MDR bacteria to existing antibiotics. In this study, novel cationic polysaccharide conjugates Dextran-&lt;i&gt;graft&lt;/i&gt;-poly(5-(1,2-dithiolan-3-yl)-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(2-guanidinoethyl)pentanamide) (Dex-&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;-PSS&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) is synthesized using disulfide exchange polymerization. Critically, bacterial membranes and efflux pumps are disrupted by a sub-inhibitory concentration of Dex-&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;-PSS&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;, which enhances rifampicin (RIF) accumulation inside bacteria and restores its efficacy. Combined Dex-&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;-PSS&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt; and RIF prevents bacterial resistance in bacteria cultured over 30 generations. Furthermore, Dex-&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;-PSS&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt; restores RIF effectiveness, reduces inflammatory reactions in a pneumonia-induced mouse model, and exhibits excellent in vivo biological absorption and degradation capabilities. As an antibiotic adjuvant, Dex-&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;-PSS&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt; provides a novel resensitizing strategy for RIF against MDR bacteria and bacterial resistance. This Dex-&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;-PSS&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt; research provides a solid platform for future MDR applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Resistive Switching Crossbar Arrays Based on Layered Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Resistive switching (RS) devices are metal/insulator/metal (MIM) cells that can change their electrical resistance when electrical stimuli are applied between the electrodes, and they can be used to store and compute data. Planar crossbar arrays of RS devices can offer a high integration density (&gt;108 devices/mm2) and this can be further enhanced by stacking them three&#8208;dimensionally. The advantage of using layered materials (LMs) in RS devices (compared to traditional phase&#8208;change materials and metal&#8208;oxides) is that their electrical properties can be adjusted with a higher precision. Here we define the key figures&#8208;of&#8208;merit and procedures to implement LM&#8208;based RS devices. We identify and discuss LM&#8208;based RS devices fabricated using methods compatible with industry. We focus on small devices (size &lt;9 &#956;m2) arranged in crossbar structures, since larger devices may be affected by artefacts, such as grain boundaries and flake junctions. We also discuss how to enhance device performance, so to accelerate the development of this technology.

         <title>Filamented Light (FLight) Biofabrication of Highly Aligned Tissue&#8208;engineered Constructs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Cell&#8208;laden hydrogels used in tissue engineering generally lack sufficient 3D topographical guidance for encapsulated cells to mature into aligned tissues. A new strategy called Filamented Light (FLight) biofabrication rapidly creates hydrogels composed of unidirectional microfilament networks, with diameters on the length scale of single cells (&lt; 30&#160;&#956;m). Due to optical modulation instability, a light beam from a laser&#8208;based K&#246;hler illumination system is divided optically into filamented light beams. Local polymerization of a photoactive resin is triggered, leading to local increase in refractive index, which itself creates self&#8208;focusing waveguides and further polymerization of photoresin into long hydrogel microfilaments. Diameter and spacing of the microfilaments can be tuned from 2&#8211;30&#160;&#956;m by changing the coherence length of the light beam. Hydrogel microfilaments show outstanding cell instructive properties with fibroblasts, tenocytes, endothelial cells, and myoblasts, influencing cell alignment, deformation of cell nucleus, and deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). FLight is compatible with multiple types of photoresins and allows for biofabrication of centimeter&#8208;scale cell&#8208;laden hydrogel constructs with excellent cell viability within seconds (&lt; 10 s per construct). Multiple directions of microfilaments are achievable within a single hydrogel construct by changing the direction of FLight projection (Cross&#8208;FLight), and complex multi&#8208;material/multi&#8208;cellular tissue&#8208;engineered constructs are possible by sequentially exchanging the cell&#8208;laden photoresin. FLight offers a transformational approach to developing anisotropic tissues using photocrosslinkable biomaterials.

         <title>Polar Species for Effective Dielectric Regulation to Achieve High&#8208;Performance CsPbI3 Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polar species modification (PSM) is employed to reduce the defect capturing probability by strengthening the defect dielectric screening effect via increasing the dielectric constant of a perovskite film. The introduction of F3EAI fills the vacancy defects at surface and also produces a hydrophobic umbrella with high resistance to humidity. PSM realizes a power conversion efficiency of 20.5% for CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Nonradiative losses caused by defects are the main obstacles to further advancing the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). There is focused research to boost the device performance by reducing the number of defects and deactivating defects; however, little attention is paid to the defect&#8208;capture capacity. Here, upon systematically examining the defect&#8208;capture capacity, highly polarized fluorinated species are designed to modulate the dielectric properties of the perovskite material to minimize its defect&#8208;capture radius. On the one hand, fluorinated polar species strengthen the defect dielectric&#8208;screening effect via enhancing the dielectric constant of the perovskite film, thus reducing the defect&#8208;capture radius. On the other, the fluorinated iodized salt replenishes the I&#8208;vacancy defects at the surface, hence lowering the defect density. Consequently, the power&#8208;conversion efficiency of an all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3 PSC is increased to as high as 20.5% with an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.2&#160;V and a fill factor of 82.87%, all of which are among the highest in their respective categories. Furthermore, the fluorinated species modification also produces a hydrophobic umbrella yielding significantly improved humidity tolerance, and hence long&#8208;term stability. The present strategy provides a general approach to effectually regulate the defect&#8208;capture radius, thus enhancing the optoelectronic performance.

         <title>Balancing the Selective Absorption and Photon&#8208;to&#8208;Electron Conversion for Semitransparent Organic Photovoltaics with 5.0% Light&#8208;Utilization Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Balancing the selective absorption and photon&#8208;to&#8208;electron conversion is key to achieving high&#8208;performance semitransparent organic photovoltaics (ST&#8208;OPVs). Following this, ST&#8208;OPV with a high light&#8208;utilization efficiency of 5.0% is reached via comprehensive optimization on materials, active layers, and device structures. Furthermore, the ST&#8208;OPV exhibits good upscaling and thermal control ability, representing a promising candidate adaptive to versatile applications.








Abstract
Efficiently converting invisible light while allowing full visible light transmission is key to achieving high&#8208;performance semitransparent organic photovoltaics (ST&#8208;OPVs). Here, a detailed balance strategy is explored to optimize the ST&#8208;OPV via taking both absorption and carrier dynamics into consideration. Based on this principle, comprehensive optimizations are carried out, including a ternary strategy, donor:acceptor blend ratio, thickness, antireflection, etc., to compromise the invisible energy conversion and visible transmission for high&#8208;performance ST&#8208;OPVs. As a result, the opaque OPV device exhibits a champion power conversion efficiency of 19.35% (certificated 19.07%), and most strikingly, the best ST&#8208;OPV shows a remarkably high light&#8208;utilization efficiency of 5.0%, where the efficiency and the average visible transmission are 12.95% and 38.67%, respectively. An efficiency of 12.09% is achieved on the upscaled device with an area of 1.05 cm2, demonstrating its promise for large&#8208;area fabrication. These results are among the best values for ST&#8208;OPVs. Besides, it is demonstrated that the ST&#8208;OPV exhibits good infrared light&#8208;reflection capability for thermal control. This work provides a rational design of balancing the absorbing selectivity and photon&#8208;to&#8208;electron conversion for high&#8208;performance ST&#8208;OPVs, and may pave the way toward the practical application of solar windows.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Measurement of Cell Mechanics as a Clinically Relevant Readout of an In Vitro Lung Fibrosis Model Established on a Bioinspired Basement Membrane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;breathing&#8221; human&#8208;based in vitro mini&#8208;lung with a patient&#8208;derived triple coculture fibrosis model introduces longitudinal pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics studies to in vitro testing of inhaled drugs. This technology relies on a novel copolymeric basement membrane for cell culturing, which overcomes the shortcomings of silicon&#8208;based membranes, and on a novel method for real&#8208;time monitoring tissue mechanics as clinically relevant functional readout.








Abstract
Lung fibrosis, one of the major post&#8208;COVID&#160;complications, is a progressive and ultimately fatal disease without a cure. Here, an organ&#8208; and disease&#8208;specific&#160;in vitro&#160;mini&#8208;lung fibrosis model equipped with noninvasive real&#8208;time monitoring of cell mechanics is introduced as a functional readout. To establish an intricate multiculture model under physiologic conditions, a biomimetic ultrathin basement (biphasic elastic thin for air&#8211;liquid culture conditions, BETA) membrane (&lt;1&#160;&#181;m) is developed&#160;with unique properties, including biocompatibility,&#160;permeability, and high elasticity (&lt;10&#160;kPa) for cell culturing under air&#8211;liquid interface and cyclic mechanical stretch conditions. The human&#8208;based triple coculture fibrosis model, which includes epithelial and endothelial cell lines combined with primary fibroblasts from&#160;idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients established on the BETA membrane, is integrated into a millifluidic bioreactor system (cyclic in vitro cell&#8208;stretch, CIVIC) with dose&#8208;controlled aerosolized drug delivery, mimicking inhalation therapy. The real&#8208;time measurement of cell/tissue stiffness (and compliance) is shown as a clinical biomarker of the progression/attenuation of fibrosis upon drug treatment, which is confirmed for&#160;inhaled&#160;Nintedanib&#8212;an antifibrosis drug.&#160;The mini&#8208;lung fibrosis model allows the combined longitudinal testing of pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of drugs, which is expected to enhance the predictive capacity of&#160;preclinical&#160;models&#160;and hence facilitate the development of approved therapies for lung fibrosis.

&lt;p&gt;A &#8220;breathing&#8221; human-based in vitro mini-lung with a patient-derived triple coculture fibrosis model introduces longitudinal pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics studies to in vitro testing of inhaled drugs. This technology relies on a novel copolymeric basement membrane for cell culturing, which overcomes the shortcomings of silicon-based membranes, and on a novel method for real-time monitoring tissue mechanics as clinically relevant functional readout.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells with a High Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage Over 1.2&#160;V Achieved by a Dual&#8208;Side Passivation Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New synthesized non&#8208;conjugated polyelectrolyte is introduced as an interfacial layer between the charge&#8208;transport layer and perovskite absorbent, which significantly reduce both bulk and interfacial nonradiative recombination losses, but also aligns the interface's energy level. The modified perovskite solar cells show a power conversion efficiency of 24.4% (open&#8208;circuit voltage 1.21&#160;V) with negligible hysteresis and superior operational stability.








Abstract
Suppressing nonradiative recombination at the interface between the organometal halide perovskite (PVK) and the charge&#8208;transport layer (CTL) is crucial for improving the efficiency and stability of PVK&#8208;based solar cells (PSCs). Here, a new bathocuproine (BCP)&#8208;based nonconjugated polyelectrolyte (poly&#8208;BCP) is synthesized and this is introduced as a &#8220;dual&#8208;side passivation layer&#8221; between the tin oxide (SnO2) CTL and the PVK absorber. Poly&#8208;BCP significantly suppresses both bulk and interfacial nonradiative recombination by passivating oxygen&#8208;vacancy defects from the SnO2 side and simultaneously scavenges ionic defects from the other (PVK) side. Therefore, PSCs with poly&#8208;BCP exhibits a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.4% and a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.21&#160;V with a reduced voltage loss (PVK bandgap of 1.56&#160;eV). The non&#8208;encapsulated PSCs also show excellent long&#8208;term stability by retaining 93% of the initial PCE after 700 h under continuous 1&#8208;sun irradiation in nitrogen atmosphere conditions.

         <title>Zn&#8208;Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Derived Ordered Mesoporous Carbon&#8208;Based Nanostructure for High&#8208;Performance and Universal Multivalent Metal Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;doped Zn&#8211;MOF (metal&#8211;organic framework) derived orderly mesoporous carbon&#8208;based nanostructure is synthesized by template&#8208;free pyrolysis and the Cu doping presents a direction&#8208;inducing function on the dissociation process of organic ligands during the pyrolysis. This orderly mesoporous derivative provides a fruitful platform to achieve a class of high&#8208;performance electrodes for universal multivalent metal ion storage in aqueous electrolytes.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) derivatives promise great potential in energy storage and conversion because of their excellent tunability in both the active metal sites, organic links, and the overall structures down to atomic and up to mesoscale. Nevertheless, a big challenge is to precisely control and thoroughly understand the actual MOF&#8208;to&#8208;derivative conversion process to realize the template&#8208;free synthesis of the MOF&#8208;derived ordered mesoporous materials. Here, a class of ordered mesoporous N&#8208;doped carbon nanoflakes is presented with slit&#8208;shaped pores synthesized by one&#8208;step pyrolysis of Zn1Cux&#8211;MOF, where the Cu doping plays a critically important direction&#8208;inducing function on the dissociation of organic ligands during the pyrolysis. Benefiting from the uniquely ordered mesoporous structure and large specific surface area (910 m2 g&#8722;1), the Zn1Cux&#8211;MOF&#8208;derived ordered mesoporous carbon nanoflakes present outstanding electrochemical storage performance for multivalent metal ions, such as Mg2+, Ca2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Al3+, and Zn2+, demonstrating the universal nature of the slit&#8208;shaped pores in enabling the multivalent metal ions for energy storage. Moreover, the assembled flexible Zn&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitor (ZHSC) delivers a high specific capacity of 134 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1, excellent cycling and mechanical stability, showing great application potential in the new generation energy storage devices.

         <title>Honeycomb&#8208;like Porous Crystalline Hetero&#8208;electrocatalyst for Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>

Abstract
Porous hetero&#8208;structure electrocatalysts with multi&#8208;functionality and synergistic effect have much benefit for efficient electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), yet it still remains a daunting challenge to explore covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs) and metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) based hetero&#8208;structures in this field. Here, we have synthesized a series of honeycomb&#8208;like porous crystalline hetero&#8208;electrocatalysts (MCH&#8208;X, X = 1&#8211;4, X stands for the numbered sample obtained from different MOFs doses in MCH synthesis) and successfully applied them in electrocatalytic CO2RR. The specially designed hetero&#8208;structures with integrated porous MOF&#8208;template and ultrathin COF&#8208;coating enable efficient CO2 adsorption/activation and conversion into CH4. Best of them, the MCH&#8208;3 showed greatly inhibited H2 evolution, excellent current density (&#8208;398.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), and superior FECH4 (76.7%) to physical mixture (38.0%), MOF@COF without honeycomb&#8208;like morphology (47.7%), bare COF (37.5%) and MOF (15.9%) at &#8208;1.0&#160;V. Based on the DFT calculations and various characterizations, the vital roles of MOF in facilitating CO2 adsorption/activation, stabilizing intermediates, and conquering the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step have been intensively studied.

         <title>Continuous color&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting devices based on compositionally graded monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The diverse series of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) materials has been employed in various optoelectronic applications, such as photodetectors, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and lasers. Typically, the detection or emission range of optoelectronic devices is unique to the bandgap of the active material. Therefore, to improve the capability of these devices, extensive efforts have been devoted to tune the bandgap, such as gating, strain, and dielectric engineering. However, the controllability of these methods is severely limited (typically &#8764;0.1&#160;eV). In contrast, alloying TMDCs is an effective approach that yields a composition&#8208;dependent bandgap and enables light emissions over a wide range. In this study, we fabricated a color&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting device using compositionally graded TMDC alloys. The monolayer WS2/WSe2 alloy grown by chemical vapor deposition showed a spatial gradient in the light emission energy, which varied from 2.1 to 1.7&#160;eV. We incorporated this alloy in an electrolyte&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting device structure that can tune the recombination zone laterally. Thus, we successfully fabricated a continuous and reversible color&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting device by controlling the light&#8208;emitting positions. Our results provide a new approach for exploring monolayer semiconductor&#8208;based broadband optical applications.

&lt;p&gt;The diverse series of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) materials has been employed in various optoelectronic applications, such as photodetectors, light-emitting diodes, and lasers. Typically, the detection or emission range of optoelectronic devices is unique to the bandgap of the active material. Therefore, to improve the capability of these devices, extensive efforts have been devoted to tune the bandgap, such as gating, strain, and dielectric engineering. However, the controllability of these methods is severely limited (typically &#8764;0.1&#160;eV). In contrast, alloying TMDCs is an effective approach that yields a composition-dependent bandgap and enables light emissions over a wide range. In this study, we fabricated a color-tunable light-emitting device using compositionally graded TMDC alloys. The monolayer WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; alloy grown by chemical vapor deposition showed a spatial gradient in the light emission energy, which varied from 2.1 to 1.7&#160;eV. We incorporated this alloy in an electrolyte-based light-emitting device structure that can tune the recombination zone laterally. Thus, we successfully fabricated a continuous and reversible color-tunable light-emitting device by controlling the light-emitting positions. Our results provide a new approach for exploring monolayer semiconductor-based broadband optical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Highly Efficient and Robust Full&#8208;color Organic Afterglow Through 2D Superlattices Embedment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Purely organic afterglow (POA) originated from the slow radiative decay of stabilized triplet excited state has shown amazing potentials in many fields. However, achieving highly stable POA with high phosphorescent quantum yield (PhQY) and long lifetime is still a formidable challenge owing to the intrinsically active and sensitive nature of triplet excitons. Here, triplet excitons of phosphors were protected and stabilized by embedding in tri&#8208;component tri&#8208;hapto self&#8208;assembled 2D hydrogen&#8208;bonded superlattices, which not only enables deep&#8208;blue POA with high PhQY (up to 65%), ultralong lifetime (over 1300&#160;ms) and the highest figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit at room temperature, but also achieves excellent stability capable of resisting quenching effects of oxygen, solvent, pressure, light and heat. Besides, POA color was tuned from deep&#8208;blue to red via efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from the deep&#8208;blue POA emitters to fluorophores. Moreover, with the high&#8208;performance, robust, and full&#8208;color POA materials, flexible anti&#8208;counterfeit display and direct current (DC)&#8208;driven lifetime&#8208;encrypted color Morse Code applications were facilely realized.

         <title>A Multi&#8208;Bioactive Nanomicelle&#8208;Based &#8220;One Stone for Multiple Birds&#8221; Strategy for Precision Therapy of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm</title>

Abstract
Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) remains a lethal aortic disease in the elderly. Currently, no effective drugs can be clinically applied to prevent the development of AAA. Herein we report a &#8220;one stone for multiple birds&#8221; strategy for AAA therapy. As a proof of concept, three bioactive conjugates are designed and synthesized, which can assemble into nanomicelles. Cellularly, these nanomicelles significantly inhibit migration and activation of inflammatory cells as well as protect vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from induced oxidative stress, calcification, and apoptosis, with the best effect for nanomicelles (TPTN) derived from a conjugate TPT. After intravenous delivery, TPTN efficiently accumulates in the aneurysmal tissue of AAA rats, showing notable distribution in neutrophils, macrophages, and VSMCs, all relevant to AAA pathogenesis. Whereas three examined nanomicelles effectively delay expansion of AAA in rats, TPTN most potently prevents AAA growth by simultaneously normalizing the pro&#8208;inflammatory microenvironment and regulating multiple pathological cells. TPTN is effective even at 0.2&#160;mg/kg. Besides, TPTN can function as a bioactive nanoplatform for site&#8208;specifically delivering and triggerably releasing anti&#8208;aneurysmal drugs, affording synergistic therapeutic effects. Consequently, TPTN is a promising multi&#8208;bioactive nanotherapy and bioresponsive targeting delivery nanocarrier for effective therapy of AAA and other inflammatory vascular diseases.

         <title>Weakening the Solvating Power of Solvents to Encapsulate Lithium Polysulfides Enables Long&#8208;Cycling Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Long cycling lifespan is a prerequisite for practical utilization of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries yet is restricted by the side reactions between soluble polysulfides and lithium metal anodes. The regulation on solvation structure of polysulfides renders encapsulating&#8208;polysulfides electrolyte (EPSE) that emerges as a promising solution to suppress the parasitic reactions. The solvating power of the solvents in the outer solvent shell of lithium polysulfides is critical for the encapsulation effect of EPSE. Herein a typical hydrofluoroether, 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyl ether (HFE) is demonstrated as a superior outer&#8208;shell solvent to construct EPSE. On the basis of the large steric hindrance of fluorohydrocarbon chains, the electron&#8208;withdrawing &#8211;CF2&#8211; segment further endows HFE molecule with prominently weak solvating power. The HFE&#8208;EPSE improves the lifespan from 54 to 135 cycles of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries with ultrathin lithium metal anodes (50&#160;&#956;m) and high&#8208;areal&#8208;loading sulfur cathodes (4.4&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). Furthermore, a 334&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1 lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cell (2.4 Ah level) with HFE&#8208;EPSE stably undergoes 25 cycles. This work demonstrates the vital role of weakening solvating power of the outer&#8208;shell solvent of lithium polysulfides to construct superior EPSE and inspires the significance of regulating the solvation chemistry of polysulfides to achieve long cycling lifespan of working lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Large Memory Window of van der Waals Heterostructure Devices Based on MOCVD&#8208;Grown 2D Layered Ge4Se9</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ge4Se9, a new insulating 2D&#8208;layered material, is synthesized using metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition at 240 &#176;C&#160;with&#160;low&#8208;reactive&#160;precursors.&#160;The 2D&#8208;layered Ge4Se9 forms a low band offset with MoS2, exhibiting a large memory window with linear gate&#8208;tunability. As an artificial synapse, the MoS2/Ge4Se9 heterostructure exhibits synaptic updates with low non&#8208;linearity of 0.26 and low energy consumption of 15 fJ.








Abstract
Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures have drawn much interest over the last decade owing to their absence of dangling bonds and their intriguing low&#8208;dimensional properties. The emergence of 2D materials has enabled the achievement of significant progress in both the discovery of physical phenomena and the realization of superior devices. In this work, the group IV metal chalcogenide 2D&#8208;layered Ge4Se9 is introduced as a new selection of insulating vdW material. 2D&#8208;layered Ge4Se9 is synthesized with a rectangular shape using the metalcorganic chemical vapor deposition system using a liquid germanium precursor at 240 &#176;C. By stacking the Ge4Se9 and MoS2, vdW heterostructure devices are fabricated with a giant memory window of 129&#160;V by sweeping back gate range of &#177;80&#160;V. The gate&#8208;independent decay time reveals that the large hysteresis is induced by the interfacial charge transfer, which originates from the low band offset. Moreover, repeatable conductance changes are observed over the 2250 pulses with low non&#8208;linearity values of 0.26 and 0.95 for potentiation and depression curves, respectively. The energy consumption of the MoS2/Ge4Se9 device is about 15 fJ for operating energy and the learning accuracy of image classification reaches 88.3%, which further proves the great potential of artificial synapses.

         <title>Crossover Effects in Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries with a Localized High Concentration Electrolyte and High&#8208;Nickel Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Profound effects of chemical crossover in a localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte with a high&#8208;nickel cathode and lithium&#8208;metal anode are presented. Lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) salt is stripped of fluorine at the anode and further decomposed at the cathode, causing a 3&#215; reduction in lithium solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase growth relative to symmetric cells and a 3&#215; increase in cathode capacity fade relative to cells with graphite anode.








Abstract
While crossover effects, such as transition&#8208;metal dissolution, are well&#8208;understood in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, there is a limited understanding of the effect of crossed&#8208;over chemical species in cells with oxide cathodes and lithium&#8208;metal anodes. In this work, the effects of cathode&#8208;to&#8208;anode and anode&#8208;to&#8208;cathode crossover are explored in cells with a high&#8208;nickel cathode, lithium&#8208;metal anode, and a localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE). Dramatic differences are found among cells; a lithium&#8208;metal anode paired with a high&#8208;nickel cathode has three times less solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase growth than a lithium&#8208;metal anode paired with lithium metal. Meanwhile, the cathode paired with lithium metal has 2&#8211;3 times higher capacity fade than the same cathode paired with graphite. Decomposition and crossover of the FSI salt is identified as the main source of these changes. The fluorine in the salt is first stripped off at the lithium&#8208;metal anode, and the remaining sulfur and nitrogen cross over to the cathode. Although the reduction in fluorine content harms the surface stability of the cathode, the lithium&#8208;metal anode benefits from the increased fluorine content. Because the lithium&#8208;metal anode is typically the bottleneck for cells with thin lithium, crossover is a major factor in the enhanced performance of lithium&#8208;metal batteries with LHCE.

         <title>An Aqueous Analog MAC Machine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 16 &#215; 16 array of ionic transistors that electrochemically functions in aqueous quinone solution is reported. It executes analog multiply&#8211;accumulate (MAC) operations, a computing modality hotly pursued for low&#8208;power artificial neural networks. This demonstrates the use of ions in the aqueous milieu for analog computing is a step toward developing a more complex bioinspired information processing platforms.








Abstract
Using ions in aqueous milieu for signal processing, like in biological circuits, may potentially lead to a bioinspired information processing platform. Studies, however, have focused on individual ionic diodes and transistors rather than circuits comprising many such devices. Here a 16&#160;&#215;&#160;16 array of new ionic transistors is developed in an aqueous quinone solution. Each transistor features a concentric ring electrode pair with a disk electrode at the center. The electrochemistry of these electrodes in the solution provides the basis for the transistor operation. The ring pair electrochemically tunes the local electrolytic concentration to modulate the disk's Faradaic reaction rate. Thus, the disk current as a Faradaic reaction to the disk voltage is gated by the ring pair. The 16&#160;&#215;&#160;16 array of these transistors performs analog multiply&#8211;accumulate (MAC) operations, a computing modality hotly pursued for low&#8208;power artificial neural networks. This exploits the transistor's operating regime where the disk current is a multiplication of the disk voltage and a weight parameter tuned by the ring pair gating. Such disk currents from multiple transistors are summated in a global reference electrode to complete a MAC task. This ionic circuit demonstrating analog computing is a step toward sophisticated aqueous ionics.

         <title>Construction of Ultrathin S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunctions of Single Ni Atom Immobilized Ti&#8208;MOF and BiVO4 for CO2 Photoconversion of nearly 100% to CO by Pure Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wide&#8208;spectrum heterojunctions are successfully fabricated by coupling single&#8208;atom Ni immobilized single&#8208;coordination&#8208;layer NTU&#8208;9 as a reformative reduction half semiconductor with 2DBiVO4 through H&#8208;bonding induction, which represents a novel S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalyst model. Favorable charge separation and efficient catalytic sites of single Ni atoms with unique local microenvironment synergistically promote CO2 photoconversion, achieving up to 66&#8208;fold conversion rate by pure water compared to reference BiVO4 nanoparticles, together with nearly 100% selectivity to CO without any H2.








Abstract
To rationally design single&#8208;atom metal&#8211;organic&#160;framework&#160;(MOF)&#8208;involving photocatalysts remains an ongoing challenge for efficient CO2 conversion. Here, cuppy microstructures, consisting of a Ti(IV)&#8208;oxo node and three linked carboxylic moieties, in the single&#8208;coordination&#8208;layer Ti2(H2dobdc)3 MOF (NTU&#8208;9) are exploited to immobilize abundant single Ni(II) sites (Ni@MOF). The coupling of Ni@MOF with BiVO4 (BVO) nanosheets by H&#8208;bonding&#8208;induced assembly process obtains wide&#8208;spectrum 2D heterojunctions. The optimal heterojunction exhibits competitive performance and enables around 66&#8208;fold CO2 conversion of that for BVO nanoparticles by pure water, with nearly 100% CO selectivity. The exceptional photoactivity is attributed to favorable S&#8208;scheme charge transfer from BVO to MOF then to single Ni(II) sites. Noteworthily, single Ni(II) sites anchored by the Ti(IV)&#8208;oxo node and vicinal carboxylic moieties serving as a unique local microenvironment (LME) are found to synergistically catalyze CO2 conversion. Specifically, the hydroxyl groups of carboxylic moieties can form H&#8208;bonds with CO2 to promote its adsorption on single Ni(II) sites, and also can provide accessible protons to facilitate H&#8208;assisted CO2 reduction. Moreover, the CO desorption and subsequent CO2 adsorption on single Ni(II) sites with LME is proved to be thermodynamically favored, and hence dominates the high CO selectivity. This work highlights the significance of modulating the LME of single atoms to rationally design photocatalysts for realizing carbon neutralization.

         <title>Massively Parallel Selection of NanoCluster Beacons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Approximately 40&#8197;000 distinct NanoCluster Beacons (NCBs) are screened on next&#8208;generation sequencing chips and new NCBs that outperform the known best NCBs are identified. Dramatic fluorescence changes are observed by substituting a single nucleotide in an NCB, which can be explained by the proposed zipper&#8208;bag model. Combining high&#8208;throughput screening with machine&#8208;learning algorithms, bright and multicolor NCBs are designed in silico.








Abstract
NanoCluster Beacons (NCBs) are multicolor silver nanocluster probes whose fluorescence can be activated or tuned by a proximal DNA strand called the activator. While a single&#8208;nucleotide difference in a pair of activators can lead to drastically different activation outcomes, termed polar opposite twins (POTs), it is difficult to discover new POT&#8208;NCBs using the conventional low&#8208;throughput characterization approaches. Here, a high&#8208;throughput selection method is reported&#160;that takes advantage of repurposed next&#8208;generation&#8208;sequencing chips to screen the activation fluorescence of &#8776;40&#8201;000&#160;activator sequences. It is found that the nucleobases at positions 7&#8211;12&#160;of the 18&#8208;nucleotide&#8208;long activator are critical to creating bright NCBs and positions 4&#8211;6&#160;and 2&#8211;4&#160;are hotspots to generate yellow&#8211;orange and red POTs, respectively. Based on these findings, a &#8220;zipper&#8208;bag&#8221; model is proposed that can explain how these hotspots facilitate the formation of distinct silver cluster chromophores and alter their chemical yields. Combining high&#8208;throughput screening with machine&#8208;learning algorithms, a pipeline is established to design bright and multicolor NCBs in silico.

         <title>Multifaceted Catalytic ROS&#8208;Scavenging via Electronic Modulated Metal Oxides for Regulating Stem Cells Fates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Developing reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging nanostructures to protect and regulate stem cells has emerged as an intriguing strategy for promoting tissue regeneration, especially in trauma microenvironments or refractory wounds. Here, we develop an electronic modulated metal oxide via Mn atom substitutions in Co3O4 nanocrystalline (Mn&#8208;Co3O4) for highly efficient and multifaceted catalytic ROS&#8208;scavenging to reverse the fates of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in oxidative stress microenvironments. Benefiting from the atomic Mn&#8208;substitution and charge transfer from Mn to Co, the Co site in Mn&#8208;Co3O4 displays an increased ratio of Co2+/Co3+ and improved redox properties, thus enhancing its intrinsic and broad&#8208;spectrum catalytic ROS&#8208;scavenging activities, which surpasses most of the currently reported metal oxides. Consequently, the Mn&#8208;Co3O4 can efficiently protect the MSCs from ROS attack and rescue their functions, including adhesion, spreading, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation. We suggest that this work not only establishes an efficient material for catalytic ROS&#8208;scavenging in stem cell&#8208;based therapeutics but also provides a new avenue to design biocatalytic metal oxides via electronic structure modulation.

         <title>Perovskite or Not Perovskite? A Deep&#8208;Learning Approach to Automatically Identify New Hybrid Perovskites from X&#8208;ray Diffraction Patterns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deep&#8208;learning approach is developed to automatically and accurately assign the structure type from the X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns of new hybrid lead halides. An accuracy of 92% is obtained and the new insights provided by the model allow the ability of scientists to discriminate manually between different structure types of new materials to be augmented.








Abstract
Determining the crystal structure is a critical step in the discovery of new functional materials. This process is time consuming and requires extensive human expertise in crystallography. Here, a machine&#8208;learning&#8208;based approach is developed, which allows it to be determined automatically if an unknown material is of perovskite type from&#160;powder X&#8208;ray diffraction. After training a deep&#8208;learning model on a dataset of known compounds, the structure types of new unknown compounds can be predicted using their experimental powder X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns. This strategy is used to distinguish perovskite&#8208;type materials in a series of new hybrid lead halides. After validation, this approach is shown to accurately identify perovskites (accuracy of 92% with convolutional neural network). From the identification of the key features of the patterns used to discriminate perovskites versus nonperovskites, crystallographers can learn how to quickly identify low&#8208;dimensional perovskites from X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns.

         <title>Energy Interplay in Materials: Unlocking Next&#8208;Generation Synchronous Multisource Energy Conversion with Layered 2D Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered 2D crystals are exemplar energy conversion materials, able to convert light, heat, or motion to electricity. These energy conversion processes can also occur synchronously, leading to complex energy interplay networks during energy harvesting/transducing. This synchronous multisource energy conversion needs to be studied and understood to enable the fabrication of next&#8208;generation energy harvesting and conversion systems.








Abstract
Layered 2D crystals have unique properties and rich chemical and electronic diversity, with over 6000 2D crystals known and, in principle, millions of different stacked hybrid 2D crystals accessible. This diversity provides unique combinations of properties that can profoundly affect the future of energy conversion and harvesting devices. Notably, this includes catalysts, photovoltaics, superconductors, solar&#8208;fuel generators, and piezoelectric devices that will receive broad commercial uptake in the near future. However, the unique properties of layered 2D crystals are not limited to individual applications and they can achieve exceptional performance in multiple energy conversion applications synchronously. This synchronous multisource energy conversion (SMEC) has yet to be fully realized but offers a real game&#8208;changer in how devices will be produced and utilized in the future. This perspective highlights the energy interplay in materials and its impact on energy conversion, how SMEC devices can be realized, particularly through layered 2D crystals, and provides a vision of the future of effective environmental energy harvesting devices with layered 2D crystals.

         <title>The Third Dimension of Ferroelectric Domain Walls</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tomographic microscopy techniques are applied to image the 3D&#160;network of ferroelectric domain walls in ErMnO3 with nanoscale spatial resolution. The study reveals how electrical currents propagate through the domain wall network and demonstrates the importance of local corrugation phenomena for the electronic transport behavior.








Abstract
Ferroelectric domain walls are quasi&#8208;2D systems that show great promise for the development of nonvolatile memory, memristor technology, and electronic components with ultrasmall feature size. Electric fields, for example, can change the domain wall orientation relative to the spontaneous polarization and switch between resistive and conductive states, controlling the electrical current. Being embedded in a 3D&#160;material, however, the domain walls are not perfectly flat and can form networks, which leads to complex physical structures. In this work, the importance of the nanoscale structure for the emergent transport properties is demonstrated, studying electronic conduction in the 3D network of neutral and charged domain walls in ErMnO3. By combining tomographic microscopy techniques and finite element modeling, the contribution of domain walls within the bulk is clarified and the significance of curvature effects for the local conduction is shown down to the nanoscale. The findings provide insights into the propagation of electrical currents in domain wall networks, reveal additional degrees of freedom for their control, and provide quantitative guidelines for the design of domain&#8208;wall&#8208;based technology.

         <title>Hot&#8208;Casting&#8208;Assisted Liquid Additive Engineering for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hot casting is shown to allow for reduced loading of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in perovskite precursor inks, and remnant DMSO in films. This suppresses formation of undesired byproducts. The resulting perovskite layers show fewer defects, while their solar cells exhibit superior operational stability under considerable UV&#8208;containing simulated solar exposure over 3000&#160;h.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance inorganic&#8211;organic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are often fabricated with a liquid additive such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which retards crystallization and reduces roughness and pinholes in the perovskite layers. However, DMSO can be trapped during perovskite film formation and induce voids and undesired reaction byproducts upon later processing steps. Here, it is shown that the amount of residual DMSO can be reduced in as&#8208;spin&#8208;coated films significantly through use of preheated substrates, or a so&#8208;called hot&#8208;casting method. Hot casting increases the perovskite film thickness given the same concentration of solutions, which allows for reducing the perovskite solution concentration. By reducing the amount of DMSO in proportion to the concentration of perovskite precursors and using hot casting, it is possible to fabricate perovskite layers with improved perovskite&#8211;substrate interfaces by suppressing the formation of byproducts, which increase trap density and accelerate degradation of the perovskite layers. The best&#8208;performing PSCs exhibit a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.4% (23.0% stabilized efficiency) under simulated solar illumination. Furthermore, encapsulated devices show considerably reduced post&#8208;burn&#8208;in decay, retaining 75% and 90% of their initial and post&#8208;burn&#8208;in efficiencies after 3000&#160;h of operation with maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under high power of ultraviolet (UV)&#8208;containing continuous light exposure.

By mixing m&#8208;F&#8208;PEA and NMAI to act as large organic cations in quasi&#8208;2D perovskites, the phase distribution control and defect passivation of quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films are realized. As a result, excellent red light emission is achieved with recorded efficiency as high as 25.8% and the maximum luminance exceeding 1300 cd cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have received great attention in recent years due to their narrow emission bandwidth and tunable emission spectrum. Efficient red emission is one of most important parts for lighting and displays. Quasi&#8208;2D perovskites can deliver high emission efficiency due to the strong carrier confinement, while the external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of red quasi&#8208;2D PeLEDs are inefficient at present, which is due to the complex distribution of different n&#8208;value phases in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films. In this work, the phase distribution of the quasi&#8208;2D perovskite is finely controlled by mixing two different large organic cations, which effectively reduces the amount of smaller n&#8208;index phases, meanwhile the passivation of lead and halide defects in perovskite films is realized. Accordingly, the PeLEDs show 25.8% EQE and 1300&#160;cd m&#8722;2 maximum brightness at 680&#160;nm, which exhibits the highest performance for red PeLEDs up to now.

Mixed&#8208;cation mixed&#8208;halide perovskite compositions represent a promising route toward achieving stable and efficient solar cells. Here, the structural evolution of these absorber layers during full device operation is investigated via operando X&#8208;ray diffraction techniques. A stabilizing compressive strain effect leading to the remixing of the halide population is unveiled, providing insight into new strategies toward increased device lifetimes and stability.








Mixed&#8208;halide mixed&#8208;cation hybrid perovskites are among the most promising perovskite compositions for application in a variety of optoelectronic devices due to their high performance, low cost, and bandgap&#8208;tuning capabilities. Instability pathways such as those driven by ionic migration, however, continue to hinder their further progress. Here, an operando variable&#8208;pitch synchrotron grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering technique is used to track the surface and bulk structural changes in mixed&#8208;halide mixed&#8208;cation perovskite solar cells under continuous load and illumination. By monitoring the evolution of the material structure, it is demonstrated that halide remixing along the electric field and illumination direction during operation hinders phase segregation and limits device instability. Correlating the evolution with directionality&#8208; and depth&#8208;dependent analyses, it is proposed that this halide remixing is induced by an electrostrictive effect acting along the substrate out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction. However, this stabilizing effect is overwhelmed by competing halide demixing processes in devices exposed to humid air or with poorer starting performance. The findings shed new light on understanding halide de&#8208; and re&#8208;mixing competitions and their impact on device longevity. These operando techniques allow real&#8208;time tracking of the structural evolution in full optoelectronic devices and unveil otherwise inaccessible insights into rapid structural evolution under external stress&#160;conditions.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature High&#8208;Areal&#8208;Capacity Rechargeable Potassium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;temperature high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity rechargeable K&#8211;Te battery is successfully fabricated. The kinetic barrier in the thick Te cathode is knocked down by the in situ electrochemical self&#8208;reconstruction of amorphous Cu1.4Te as a fast ionic pathway, and meanwhile, the K&#8208;metal anode is stabilized by electrolyte regulation. This approach could be extended to other low&#8208;temperature alkali&#8208;metal&#8211;chalcogen battery systems (Li&#8211;S, Li&#8211;Se, Na&#8211;S, Na&#8211;Se, etc.).








Abstract
High mass loading and high areal capacity are key metrics for commercial batteries, which are usually limited by the large charge&#8208;transfer impedance in thick electrodes. This can be kinetically deteriorated under low temperatures, and the realization of high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity batteries in cold climates remains challenging. Herein, a low&#8208;temperature high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity rechargeable potassium&#8211;tellurium (K&#8211;Te) battery is successfully fabricated by knocking down the kinetic barriers in the cathode and pairing it with stable anode. Specifically, the in situ electrochemical self&#8208;reconstruction of amorphous Cu1.4Te in a thick electrode is realized simply by coating micro&#8208;sized Te on the Cu collector, significantly improving its ionic conductivity. Meanwhile, the optimized electrolyte enables fast ion transportation and a stable K&#8208;metal anode at a large current density and areal capacity. Consequently, this K&#8211;Te battery achieves a high areal capacity of 1.25&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, which greatly exceeds those of most reported works. This work highlights the significance of electrode design and electrolyte engineering for high areal capacity at low temperatures, and represents a critical step toward practical applications of low&#8208;temperature batteries.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Electrostrictive Relaxors with Dispersive Endotaxial Nanoprecipitations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via the construction of novel local heterostructures of polar nanoregions and endotaxial nanoprecipitations with a nonpolar core in relaxor ferroelectric ceramics, an unprecedentedly large hysteresis&#8208;free strain is achieved under a low stimulated electric field, which is suitable for the application of ultrahigh precision actuator systems. The new strategy can open a new realm for the design of high&#8208;performance ferroelectric relaxors.








Abstract
Ultrahigh&#8208;precision manufacturing and detection have highlighted the importance of investigating electrostrictive materials with a weak stimulated extrinsic electric field and a simultaneous large hysteresis&#8208;free strain. In this study, a new type of electrostrictive relaxor ferroelectric is designed by constructing a complex inhomogeneous local structure to realize excellent electrostrictive properties. A remarkably large electrostrictive coefficient, M33 (8 &#215; 10&#8722;16 m2 V&#8722;2) is achieved. Through a combined atomic&#8208;scale scanning transmission electron microscopy and advanced in situ high&#8208;energy synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, it is observed that such superior electrostrictive properties can be ascribed to a special domain structure that consists of endotaxial nanoprecipitations embedded in a polar matrix at the phase boundary of the rhombohedral/tetragonal/cubic phases. The matrix contributes to the high strain response under the weak extrinsic electric field because of the highly flexible polarization and randomly dispersed endotaxial nanoprecipitations with a nonpolar central region, which provide a strong restoring force that reduces the strain hysteresis. The approach developed in this study is widely applicable to numerous relaxor ferroelectrics, as well as other dielectrics, for further enhancing their electrical properties, such as electrostriction and energy&#8208;storage capacity.

         <title>Efficient Electroreduction of Nitrate into Ammonia at Ultralow Concentrations Via an Enrichment Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu nanoparticles encapsulated with porous carbon framework are developed as an efficient electrocatalyst for nitrate (NO3&#8722;) electroreduction at ultralow concentrations. Benefiting from the enrichment effect of porous carbon framework, the yield rate of NH3 for the electrocatalyst reached 469.5&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 with 1&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;3 m NO3&#8722;.








Abstract
The electroreduction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) pollutants to ammonia (NH3)&#160;offers an alternative approach for both wastewater treatment and NH3 synthesis. Numerous electrocatalysts have been reported for the electroreduction of NO3&#8722; to NH3, but most of them demonstrate poor performance at ultralow NO3&#8722; concentrations. In this study, a Cu&#8208;based catalyst for electroreduction of NO3&#8722; at ultralow concentrations is developed by encapsulating Cu nanoparticles in a porous carbon framework (Cu@C). At &#8722;0.3&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), Cu@C achieves Faradaic efficiency for NH3 of 72.0% with 1&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;3 m NO3&#8722;, which is 3.6 times higher than that of Cu nanoparticles. Notably, at &#8722;0.9&#160;V vs RHE, the yield rate of NH3 for Cu@C is 469.5&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, which is the highest value reported for electrocatalysts with 1&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;3 m NO3&#8722;. An investigation of the mechanism reveals that NO3&#8722; can be concentrated owing to the enrichment effect of the porous carbon framework in Cu@C, thereby facilitating the mass transfer of NO3&#8722; for efficient electroreduction into NH3 at ultralow concentrations.

         <title>Osteoimmunity&#8208;Regulating Biomimetically Hierarchical Scaffold for Augmented Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D printed scaffold with biomimetically hierarchical porous structure is constructed for augmented bone regeneration through the enhanced immunomodulatory, angiogenic, osteogenic, and weak osteoclastogenic abilities. Such osteoimmunity&#8208;regulating scaffold upregulates M2 macrophages by released carbon monoxide and&#160;Mn2+, enhances neovascularization through secreted vascular endothelial growth factor, and effectively stimulates osteoinductive activity while inhibiting osteoclast differentiation, offering positive enlightenment for promoting large&#8208;scale bone defect repair.








Abstract
Engineering a proper immune response following biomaterial implantation is essential to bone tissue regeneration. Herein, a biomimetically hierarchical scaffold composed of deferoxamine@poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) nanoparticles (DFO@PCL NPs), manganese carbonyl (MnCO) nanosheets, gelatin methacryloyl hydrogel, and a polylactide/hydroxyapatite (HA) matrix is fabricated to augment bone repair by facilitating the balance of the immune system and bone metabolism. First, a 3D printed stiff scaffold with a well&#8208;organized gradient structure mimics the cortical and cancellous bone tissues; meanwhile, an inside infusion of a soft hydrogel further endows the scaffold with characteristics of the extracellular matrix. A Fenton&#8208;like reaction between MnCO and endogenous hydrogen peroxide generated at the implant&#8208;tissue site triggers continuous release of carbon monoxide and Mn2+, thus significantly lessening inflammatory response by upregulating the M2 phenotype of macrophages, which also secretes vascular endothelial growth factor to induce vascular formation. Through activating the hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; pathway, Mn2+ and DFO@PCL NP further promote angiogenesis. Moreover, DFO inhibits osteoclast differentiation and synergistically collaborates with the osteoinductive activity of HA. Based on amounts of data in vitro and in vivo, strong immunomodulatory, intensive angiogenic, weak osteoclastogenic, and superior osteogenic abilities of such an osteoimmunity&#8208;regulating scaffold present a profound effect on improving bone regeneration, which puts forward a worthy base and positive enlightenment for large&#8208;scale bone defect repair.

         <title>Vacancy&#8208;Rich MXene&#8208;Immobilized Ni Single Atoms as a High&#8208;Performance Electrocatalyst for the Hydrazine Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts on Ti defect&#8208;rich Ti3C2Tx MXene are fabricated via a combined defect&#8208;trapping and &#8220;self&#8208;reduction&#8221; process. The optimal Ni SACs on Ti3C2Tx MXene at a Ni loading of 2.93 wt% exhibit superior&#160;catalytic performance for the electrochemical hydrazine oxidation reaction, which is attributed to the optimal electronic density of states that enhances the adsorption energy and lowers the reaction energy barrier.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), on account of their outstanding catalytic potential, are currently emerging&#160;as high&#8208;performance materials in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Constructing a strong interaction between the single atom and its supporting matrix plays a pivotal role. Herein, Ti3C2Tx&#8208;MXene&#8208;supported Ni SACs are reported by using a self&#8208;reduction strategy via the assistance of rich Ti vacancies on the Ti3C2Tx MXene surface, which act as the trap and anchor sites for individual Ni atoms. The constructed Ni SACs supported by the Ti3C2Tx MXene (Ni SACs/Ti3C2Tx ) show an ultralow onset potential of &#8722;0.03 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) and an exceptional operational stability toward the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR). Density functional theory calculations suggest a strong coupling of the Ni single atoms and their&#160;surrounding C atoms, which optimizes the electronic density of states, increasing the adsorption energy and decreasing the reaction activation energy, thus boosting the electrochemical activity. The results presented here will encourage a wider pursuit of 2D&#8208;materials&#8208;supported SACs designed by a vacancy&#8208;trapping strategy.

         <title>Controllable Heterogenous Seeding&#8208;Induced Crystallization for High&#8208;Efficiency FAPbI3&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells Over 24%</title>

         <dc:description>
Heterogenous seeding&#8208;induced crystallization is introduced to assist perovskite growth. Di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl(methyl)phosphonium tetrafluoroborate is introduced into the precursor to form a low&#8208;solubility complex with PbI2, which serve as seed to induce perovskite crystallization during solvent evaporation. The hetero&#8208;SiC process is a proven effective way to manipulate the nucleation process and crystal growth, visualized by several in situ measurement tools.








Abstract
The addition of small seeding particles into a supersaturated solution is one among the most effective approaches to obtain high&#8208;quality semiconductor materials via increased crystallization rates. However, limited study is conducted on this approach for the fabrication of perovskite solar cells. Here, a new strategy&#8212;&#8220;heterogenous seeding&#8208;induced crystallization (hetero&#8208;SiC)&#8221; to assist the growth of FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskite&#160;is proposed. In this work, di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl(methyl)phosphonium tetrafluoroborate is directly introduced into the precursor, which forms a low&#8208;solubility complex with PbI2. The low&#8208;solubility complex can serve as the seed to induce crystallization of the perovskite during the solvent&#8208;evaporation process. Various in situ measurement&#160;tools are used to visualize the hetero&#8208;SiC process, which is shown to be an effective way of manipulating the nucleation and crystal growth of perovskites. The hetero&#8208;SiC process greatly improves the film quality, reduces film defects, and suppresses nonradiative recombination. A hetero&#8208;SIC proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept device exhibits outstanding performance with 24.0% power conversion efficiency (PCE), well over the control device with 22.2% PCE. Additionally, hetero&#8208;SiC perovskite solar cell (PSC) stability under light illumination is enhanced and the PSC retains 84% of its initial performance after 1400 h of light illumination.

         <title>Visualizing Dynamic Mechanical Actions with High Sensitivity and High Resolution by Near&#8208;Distance Mechanoluminescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;sensitivity and high&#8208;resolution visualization of dynamic mechanical action is achieved by a proposed near&#8208;distance mechanoluminescence (ML) imaging scheme and an enhanced mechano&#8208;to&#8208;photon convertor. The developed portable ML stress sensor exhibits high sensitivity with a threshold of &#8776;kPa level, high spatial resolution with a pixel size &#8776;100&#160;&#181;m, and fast response of &#8776;3.3&#160;ms.








Abstract
Proportionally converting the applied mechanical energy into photons by individual mechanoluminescent (ML) micrometer&#8208;sized particles opens a new way to develop intelligent electronic skins as it promises high&#8208;resolution stress distribution visualization and fast response. However, a big challenge for ML sensing technology is its low sensitivity in detecting stress. In this work, a novel stress distribution sensor with the detection sensitivity enhanced by two orders of magnitude is developed by combining a proposed near&#8208;distance ML imaging scheme with an improved mechano&#8208;to&#8208;photon convertor. The enhanced sensitivity is the main contributor to the realization of a maximum photon harvesting rate of &#8776;80% in the near&#8208;distance ML imaging scheme. The developed near&#8208;distance ML sensor shows a high sensitivity with a detection limit down to &#8776;kPa level, high spatial resolution of 254&#160;dpi, and fast response with an interval of 3.3&#160;ms, which allows for high&#8208;resolution and real&#8208;time visualization of complex mechanical actions such as irregular solid contacts or fluid impacts, and thus enables use in intelligent electronic skin, structural health monitoring, and human&#8211;computer interaction.

         <title>3D Hydrogel Evaporator with Vertical Radiant Vessels Breaking the Trade&#8208;Off between Thermal Localization and Salt Resistance for Solar Desalination of High&#8208;Salinity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>

A 3D hydrogel evaporator with vertical radiant vessels (VR&#8208;evaporator) is prepared to surmount the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off between thermal localization and salt resistance for solar desalination of high&#8208;salinity, thereby achieving a groundbreaking overall performance.








Abstract
Delivering sufficient water to the evaporation surface/interface is one of the most widely adopted strategies to overcome salt accumulation in solar&#8208;driven interfacial desalination. However, water transport and heat conduction loss are positively correlated, resulting in the trade&#8208;off between thermal localization and salt resistance. Herein, a 3D hydrogel evaporator with vertical radiant vessels is prepared to surmount the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off, thereby achieving high&#8208;rate and stable solar desalination of high&#8208;salinity. Experiments and numerical simulations reveal that the unique hierarchical structure, which consists of a large vertical vessel channel, radiant vessels, and porous vessel walls, facilitates strong self&#8208;salt&#8208;discharge and low longitudinal thermal conductivity. With the structure employed, a groundbreaking comprehensive performance, under one sun illumination, of evaporation rate as high as 3.53&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1, salinity of 20&#160;wt%, and a continuous 8&#160;h evaporation is achieved, which thought to be the best reported result from a salt&#8208;free system. This work showcases the preparation method of a novel hierarchical microstructure, and also provides pivotal insights into the design of next&#8208;generation solar evaporators of high&#8208;efficiency and salt tolerance.

         <title>Periodic Nanoporous Inorganic Patterns Directly Made by Self&#8208;Ordering of Cracks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Patterning nanoporous inorganic films by lithography remains a challenge for their integration into functional devices. Liquid deposition of aqueous inks can form patterns via self&#8208;ordering of cracks over several centimeters in both 2D and 3D. The method is chemically versatile and is shown to successfully pattern more than ten functional materials. Periodic arrays of cracks then serve as photonic sensors.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed inorganic nanoporous films are key components for the vast spectrum of applications ranging from dew harvesting to solar cells. Shaping them into complex architectures required for advanced functionality often needs time&#8208;consuming or expensive fabrication. In this work, crack formation is harnessed to pattern porous inorganic films in a single step and without using lithography. Aqueous inks, containing inorganic precursors and polymeric latexes enable evaporation&#8208;induced, defect&#8208;free periodic arrays of cracks with tunable dimensions over several centimeters. The ink formulation strategy is generalized to more than ten inorganic materials including simple and binary porous oxide and metallic films covering a whole spectrum of properties including insulating, photocatalytic, electrocatalytic, conductive, or electrochromic materials. Notably, this approach enables 3D self&#8208;assembly of cracks by stacking several layers of different compositions, yielding periodic assemblies of polygonal shapes and Janus&#8208;type patterns. The crack patterned periodic arrays of nanoporous TiO2 diffract light, and are used as temperature&#8208;responsive diffraction grating sensors. More broadly, this method represents a unique example of a self&#8208;assembly process leading to long&#8208;range order (over several centimeters) in a robust and controlled way.

         <title>A Reactive Superhydrophobic Platform for Living Photolithography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile approach for single&#8208;step fabrication of superhydrophobic surfaces with chemical reactivity is presented for photolithography in a living manner. The spatial and temporal controllability of the surface configuration under visible light enables the regulation of the location, density, and species of the functional molecules on the reactive surface, and formation of aqueous/oil microdroplets arrays, anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels, and integrated enzyme biochips.








Abstract
Superhydrophobic surfaces with regional functions have widespread applications in biotechnology, diagnostic applications, and micro&#8208;chemical synthesis and analysis. However, owing to their chemical inertness, superhydrophobic surfaces with chemical reactivity are difficult to achieve. Superhydrophobic surfaces that can be further modified with varied densities and expanded species of the functional moieties are not readily available. In this study, a single&#8208;step approach to achieve a reactive superhydrophobic surface is reported, on which chemical grafting of a library of molecules can be carried out through surface&#8208;initiated atom&#8208;transfer radical addition or surface&#8208;initiated atom&#8208;transfer radical polymerization. The excellent spatial and temporal controllability of these chemical processes under visible light enables us to take advantage of programmed liquid&#8208;crystal&#8208;display (LCD) or Digital Light Processing (DLP) photolithography systems to effortlessly regulate the location, density, and species of the functional molecules on the reactive superhydrophobic surface. The distinctive properties of this surface will provide new insight into intelligent superhydrophobic material development and practical applications, such as aqueous/oil microdroplets array, multi&#8208;anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels and integrated microfluidic reactors with enzymes for chemical logic learning.

         <title>Cold&#8208;Starting All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries from Room Temperature by Thermally Modulated Current Collector in Sub&#8208;Minute</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermally modulated current collector is reported, which can rapidly cold&#8208;start all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries from room temperature to operating temperatures (70&#8211;90&#160;&#176;C) in less than 1 min, and simultaneously enhance the transient peak power density by 15&#8208;fold compared to one without heating.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) show great potential as high&#8208;energy and high&#8208;power energy&#8208;storage devices but their attainable energy/power density at room temperature is severely reduced because of the sluggish kinetics of lithium&#8208;ion transport. Here a thermally modulated current collector (TMCC) is reported, which can rapidly cold&#8208;start ASSBs from room temperature to operating temperatures (70&#8211;90&#160;&#176;C) in less than 1 min, and simultaneously enhance the transient peak power density by 15&#8208;fold compared to one without heating. This TMCC is prepared by integrating a uniform, ultrathin (&#8776;200&#160;nm) nickel layer as a thermal modulator within an ultralight polymer&#8208;based current collector. By isolating the thermal modulator from the ion/electron pathway of ASSBs, it can provide fast, stable heat control yet does not interfere with regular battery operation. Moreover, this ultrathin (13.2&#160;&#181;m) TMCC effectively shortens the heat&#8208;transfer pathway, minimizes heat losses, and mitigates the formation of local hot spots. The simulated heating energy consumption can be as low as &#8776;3.94% of the total battery energy. This TMCC design with good tunability opens new frontiers toward smart energy&#8208;storage devices in the future from the current collector perspective.

&lt;p&gt;A thermally modulated current collector is reported, which can rapidly cold-start all-solid-state batteries from room temperature to operating temperatures (70&#8211;90&#160;&#176;C) in less than 1 min, and simultaneously enhance the transient peak power density by 15-fold compared to one without heating.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) show great potential as high-energy and high-power energy-storage devices but their attainable energy/power density at room temperature is severely reduced because of the sluggish kinetics of lithium-ion transport. Here a thermally modulated current collector (TMCC) is reported, which can rapidly cold-start ASSBs from room temperature to operating temperatures (70&#8211;90&#160;&#176;C) in less than 1 min, and simultaneously enhance the transient peak power density by 15-fold compared to one without heating. This TMCC is prepared by integrating a uniform, ultrathin (&#8776;200&#160;nm) nickel layer as a thermal modulator within an ultralight polymer-based current collector. By isolating the thermal modulator from the ion/electron pathway of ASSBs, it can provide fast, stable heat control yet does not interfere with regular battery operation. Moreover, this ultrathin (13.2&#160;&#181;m) TMCC effectively shortens the heat-transfer pathway, minimizes heat losses, and mitigates the formation of local hot spots. The simulated heating energy consumption can be as low as &#8776;3.94% of the total battery energy. This TMCC design with good tunability opens new frontiers toward smart energy-storage devices in the future from the current collector perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Single&#8208;Molecule Memristor based on an Electric&#8208;Field&#8208;Driven Dynamical Structure Reconfiguration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;molecule memristor with long&#8208;lasting retained memory states, high write&#8211;erase endurance, and adjustable on/off ratio is realized by a novel mechanism&#8212;dynamical structure reconfiguration in the Fries rearrangement. Precise manipulation of the potential energy surface of the reaction by external electric fields can retain and switch the corresponding desired species along the reaction coordinate to achieve a memory effect.








Abstract
A robust single&#8208;molecule memristor is prepared by covalently integrating one phenol molecule with multiple binding sites into nanogapped graphene electrodes. Multilevel resistance switching is realized by the electric&#8208;field&#8208;manipulated reconfiguration of the acyl moiety on the phenol center, that is, the Fries rearrangement. In situ measurements of the reaction trajectories with an initial single substrate and an intermediate break through the limitation of macroscopic experiments, therefore unveiling both intramolecular and intermolecular mechanistic pathways (a long&#8208;term controversy) as well as comprehensive dynamic information. Based on this advance, high&#8208;performance single&#8208;molecule memristors in both the solution and solid states are achieved successively, providing a new understanding of memristive systems and neural network computing.

         <title>An Initial Covalent Organic Polymer with Closed&#8208;F Edges Directly for Proton&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An initial F&#8208;decorated quasi&#8208;phthalocyanine covalent organic polymer is prepared, which delivers exceptional catalytic activity in the acidic oxygen reduction reaction and has capability to be directly applied into proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells devices, which is a stride forward among catalysts based on a pyrolysis&#8208;free conjugated&#8208;polymer network in device manner to date.








Abstract
Covalent organic polymers (COPs) are a class of rising electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to the atomically metrical control of the organic molecular components along with highly architectural robustness and thermodynamic stability even in acid or alkaline media. However, the direct application of pristine COPs as acidic ORR electrocatalysts, especially in device manner, e.g., in proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), remains a big challenge. Currently, the decoration toward electronic structures of active sites is considered a vital pathway to enhancing the acidic ORR activity of carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Here, an initial F&#8208;decorated fully closed &#960;&#8208;conjugated quasi&#8208;phthalocyanine COP (denoted as COPBTC&#8208;F) is reported. The introduction of the closed&#8208;F edges stepwise drags more electrons from FeN4 sites in COPBTC&#8208;F into the catalyst margin, which weakens the occupied numbers of bonding orbitals between COPBTC&#8208;F and OH* intermediates at the rate&#8208;determining step, exhibiting over five times intrinsic performance beyond the counterpart without F functionalities (termed as COPBTC). Significantly, the maximum power density utilizing COPBTC&#8208;F as a cathode catalyst in PEMFCs is remarkably increased by an order of magnitude compared with COPBTC, which is a stride forward among catalysts based on a pyrolysis&#8208;free conjugated&#8208;polymer network in device manner to date.

         <title>A Chiral Dual&#8208;Core Organoboron Structure Realizes Dual&#8208;Channel Enhanced Ultrapure Blue Emission and Highly Efficient Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a steric&#8208;hindrance&#8208;assisted dual&#8208;core strategy, chiral organoboron structures are prepared by direct bonding of two multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) monocores, realizing superior chiroptical property and dual&#8208;channel enhanced ultrapure blue emission. Furthermore, highly efficient circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) with maximum external quantum efficiencies of 23.9% and 25.6% are achieved.








Abstract
The realization of luminescent materials with narrowband and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is of great significance for the development of future optical and photonic devices. Herein, through a steric&#8208;hindrance&#8208;assisted dual&#8208;core strategy, two pairs of chiral dual&#8208;core multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials (R/S&#8208;DOBN and R/S&#8208;DOBNT) are directly constructed by the bonding of two organoboron MR&#8208;TADF monocores (SOBN and SOBNT) with carbazole/3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole and phenol derivative as donors, realizing obvious CPL and narrowband emissions. Furthermore, the dual&#8208;core effect in the prepared R/S&#8208;DOBN and R/S&#8208;DOBNT increases the transition oscillator strength two times more than that of a monocore structure, while maintaining the ultrapure blue emissions peaking at 453 and 459&#160;nm with a narrower full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 21&#160;nm through reorganization energy reduction. The circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the enantiomers exhibit ultrapure blue emission with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.14, 0.10) and (0.13, 0.12), high maximum external quantum efficiencies of 23.9% and 25.6%, and obvious circularly polarized electroluminescence with dissymmetry factors (|gEL|) &#8776; 10&#8722;3.

         <title>Releasable Water Charge&#8208;Trapping and Water&#8208;Resistant Photodetection using 1D Perovskitoid Hydrate Single Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Releasable water charge&#8208;trapping is observed from the transient absorption spectra in a quasi&#8208;1D perovskitoid single&#8208;crystal hydrate, and a dynamic model is proposed to interpret the charge trapping and release processes. Besides, water&#8208;resistant photodetection devices are fabricated based on this single crystal.








Abstract
Hydrates of hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites have been discovered with MAPbI3 and are proved to be unstable in atmosphere. However, the influence of water molecules on the performance of optoelectronic devices is still not fully understood. Here, using a dication, 2&#8208;(dimethylamino) ethylamine (DMEN2+), a stable quasi&#8208;1D&#160;perovskitoid hydrate single crystal is designed and successfully synthesized, which is formulated as DMENPb2I6&#183;H2O. In this design, both corner&#8208;sharing and edge&#8208;sharing connectivity are adopted, and water molecules are connected with the crystal through hydrogen bonding. It is discovered that such water sites distributed along the inorganic chains function both as charge traps and as releasable charge stocks. Optical excitation that overcomes the potential wells formed on these water sites may release these stocked charges and facilitate enhanced transportable charge density. Meanwhile, exciton diffusion and charge transport are strongly confined in the 1D transport channels. Above mechanisms are verified both by the transient absorption spectroscopy and by the photodetection performance. This introduces a new design strategy with a trapping&#8211;stock&#8211;releasing&#8211;transport roadmap for perovskitoid materials. Excellent water resistance endows this material with more advantages in the development of a new generation of optoelectronic devices.

Above mechanisms are verified both by the transient absorption spectroscopy and by the photodetection performance. This introduces a new design strategy with a trapping&#8211;stock&#8211;releasing&#8211;transport roadmap for perovskitoid materials. Excellent water resistance endows this material with more advantages in the development of a new generation of optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Self&#8208;Reporting Fluorescent Salicylaldehyde&#8211;Chlorambucil Conjugate as a Type&#8208;II ICD Inducer for Cancer Vaccines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemotherapeutic type&#8208;II immunogenic cell death inducer. SA&#8208;Cbl. with fluorescent self&#8208;reporting ability is developed by simple conjugation of chemotherapeutic drug chlorambucil with salicylaldehyde. The long&#8208;lasting effect of antitumor immunity of SA&#8208;Cbl is proved to be more effective than the non&#8208;endoplasmic reticulum&#8208;targeted drug doxorubicin via an in vivo model.








Abstract
Immunogenic cell death (ICD) can activate the anticancer immune response and is highly attractive to improve cancer treatment efficacy. ICD is closely related to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and a series of ICD inducers has recently been reported based on ER&#8208;targeted photodynamic/photothermal agents or metal complexes. However, these ER&#8208;targeted ICD inducers suffer from complicated synthesis and heavy&#8208;metal cytotoxicity. Inspired by the promising clinical potential of small organic molecules, herein, an ER&#8208;targeted fluorescent self&#8208;reporting ICD inducer, SA&#8208;Cbl, is developed by simple conjugation of the chemotherapeutic drug chlorambucil (Cbl) with salicylaldehyde (SA). SA&#8208;Cbl can selectively accumulate in the ER to induce rapid ROS generation and an unfolded protein response process, which leads to a fast release of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns and efficient dendritic cells maturation. Meanwhile, the ER&#8208;targeted accumulation and ER&#8208;stress&#8208;inducing process can be in situ monitored based on the turn&#8208;on fluorescence of SA&#8208;Cbl, which is highly pH&#8208; and polarity&#8208;sensitive and can selectively interact with ER proteins. Compared with the traditional chemotherapy drug doxorubicin, the superior anticancer immunity effect of SA&#8208;Cbl is verified via an in vivo tumor model. This study thus provides a new strategy for developing fluorescent self&#8208;reporting ICD inducers by decoration of chemotherapeutic drugs with pH and polarity&#8208;sensitive organic fluorophores.

         <title>Coordination Symmetry Breaking of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Robust and Efficient Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coordination&#8208;symmetry&#8208;breaking Cusingle&#8208;atom catalyst enables a good balance between catalytic activity and long&#8208;term stability in nitrate electroreduction to ammonia. The catalytic activity is retained after operation for more than 2000 h, while an average ammonia production rate of 27.84 mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at an industrial level current density of 366 mA cm&#8722;2 is achieved.








Abstract
Nitrate electrocatalytic reduction (NO3RR) for ammonia production is a promising strategy to close the N&#8208;cycle from nitration contamination, as well as an alternative to the Haber&#8211;Bosch process with less energy consumption and carbon dioxide release. However, current long&#8208;term stability of NO3RR catalysts is usually tens of hours, far from the requirements for industrialization. Here, symmetry&#8208;broken Cusingle&#8208;atom catalysts are designed, and the catalytic activity is retained after operation for more than 2000 h, while an average ammonia production rate of 27.84&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at an industrial level current density of 366&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 is achieved, obtaining a good balance between catalytic activity and long&#8208;term stability. Coordination symmetry breaking is achieved by embedding one Cu atom in graphene nanosheets with two N and two O atoms in the cis&#8208;configuration, effectively lowering the coordination symmetry, rendering the active site more polar, and accumulating more NO3&#8722; near the electrocatalyst surface. Additionally, the cis&#8208;coordination splits the Cu 3d orbitals, which generates an orbital&#8208;symmetry&#8208;matched &#960;&#8208;complex of the key intermediate *ONH and reduces the energy barrier, compared with the &#963;&#8208;complex generated with other catalysts. These results reveal the critical role of coordination symmetry in single&#8208;atom catalysts, prompting the design of more coordination&#8208;symmetry&#8208;broken electrocatalysts toward possible industrialization.

         <title>A Van Der Waals Reconfigurable Multi&#8208;Valued Logic Device and Circuit Based on Tunable Negative&#8208;Differential&#8208;Resistance Phenomenon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reconfigurable, multiple negative&#8208;differential&#8208;resistance device with an electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced tunability of multiple threshold voltages is proposed. Following the successful verification of the tunability of multiple negative&#8208;differential&#8208;resistance phenomenon, the reconfigurability in terms of the function of multi&#8208;valued logic circuits, from ternary inverter to latch circuit, is demonstrated.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;valued logic (MVL) technology that utilizes more than two logic states has recently been reconsidered because of the demand for greater power saving in current binary logic systems. Extensive efforts have been invested in developing MVL devices with multiple threshold voltages by adopting negative differential transconductance and resistance. In this study, a reconfigurable, multiple negative&#8208;differential&#8208;resistance (m&#8208;NDR) device with an electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced tunability of multiple threshold voltages is reported, which comprises a BP/ReS2 heterojunction and a ReS2/h&#8208;BN/metal capacitor. Tunability for the m&#8208;NDR phenomenon is achieved via the resistance modulation of the ReS2 layer by electrical pulses applied to the capacitor region. Reconfigurability is verified in terms of the function of an MVL circuit composed of a reconfigurable m&#8208;NDR device and a load transistor, wherein staggered&#8208;type and broken&#8208;type double peak&#8208;NDR device operations are adopted for ternary inverter and latch circuits, respectively.

         <title>Kirigami&#8208;Inspired Pressure Sensors for Wearable Dynamic Cardiovascular Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kirigami&#8208;inspired pressure sensor is developed for wearable dynamic cardiovascular monitoring. Utilizing the vertical kirigami&#8208;inspired structure and a simple fabrication process, the sensor provides an ascendant way for wearable bioelectronics to overcome motion artifacts when monitoring human pulse signals, thus representing a solid advancement toward personalized cardiovascular monitoring in the era of the Internet of things.








Abstract
Continuously and accurately monitoring pulse&#8208;wave signals is critical to prevent and diagnose cardiovascular diseases. However, existing wearable pulse sensors are vulnerable to motion artifacts due to the lack of proper adhesion and conformal interface with human skin during body movement. Here, a highly sensitive and conformal pressure sensor inspired by the kirigami structure is developed to measure the human pulse wave on different body artery sites under various prestressing pressure conditions and even with body movement. COMSOL multiphysical field coupling simulation and experimental testing are used to verify the unique advantages of the kirigami structure. The device shows a superior sensitivity (35.2&#160;mV Pa&#8722;1) and remarkable stability (&gt;84&#160;000 cycles). Toward practical applications, a wireless cardiovascular monitoring system is developed for wirelessly transmitting the pulse signals to a mobile phone in real&#8208;time, which successfully distinguished the pulse waveforms from different participants. The pulse waveforms measured by the kirigami inspired pressure sensor are as accurate as those provided by the commercial medical device. Given the compelling features, the sensor provides an ascendant way for wearable electronics to overcome motion artifacts when monitoring pulse signals, thus representing a solid advancement toward personalized healthcare in the era of the Internet of Things.

         <title>Controllable Inverse Photoconductance in Semiconducting Nanowire Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interesting phenomenon in that Te nanowires (NWs) behave with&#160;a&#160;negative photoresponse to positive photoresponse under enlarged optical intensities from the UV to VIS&#8211;IR region is reported. The inverse photoconductance can be attributed to the competition between the photoconductive effect and oxygen desorption effect. Moreover, the influence of the size of Te NWs and their layers is also discussed.








Abstract
As a typical p&#8208;type semiconductor, tellurium (Te) has been widely studied for the construction of photodetectors. However, only the positive photoconductance of Te&#8208;based photodetectors based on the photoconductive effect has been observed in the reported literature. Herein, an unusual but interesting phenomenon, in&#160;that tellurium nanowires (NWs) behave with&#160;negative photoresponse to positive photoresponse under enlarged optical intensities from the UV to VIS&#8211;IR region is reported. According to the experiments and simulations, adsorbed oxygen on the surface of Te NWs plays a significant role in the abnormal photoresponse. The inverse photoconductance can be attributed to the competition between the photoconductive effect and the oxygen desorption effect. Moreover, the influence of the size and layers of Te NWs is also discussed. This inverse photoconductance phenomenon is further explored by introducing the Te&#8211;Au heterojunction system. Hot&#8208;electron injection at the Te&#8211;Au heterojunction interface induces a more obvious tendency to behave with a negative photoresponse. These findings will be beneficial for potential applications of Te&#8208;NW&#8208;based photodetectors.

         <title>Top&#8208;Layer Engineering Reshapes Charge Transfer at Polar Oxide Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polar discontinuity at the interface between ferromagnetic insulating double&#8208;perovskite La2NiMnO6 (LNMO) and SrTiO3 triggers the formation of Mn3+ at both LNMO interfaces. Such electron doping is detrimental to Ni/Mn ordering and Curie temperature of films thinner than 10 uc. Engineering the charge transfer with a LaNiO3 overlayer results in optimized ferromagnetic properties, only restricted by dimensionality effects.








Abstract
Charge&#8208;transfer phenomena at heterointerfaces are a promising pathway to engineer functionalities absent in bulk materials but can also lead to degraded properties in ultrathin films. Mitigating such undesired effects with an interlayer reshapes the interface architecture, restricting its operability. Therefore, developing less&#8208;invasive methods to control charge transfer will be beneficial. Here, an appropriate top&#8208;interface design allows for remote manipulation of the charge configuration of the buried interface and concurrent restoration of the ferromagnetic trait of the whole film. Double&#8208;perovskite insulating ferromagnetic La2NiMnO6 (LNMO) thin films grown on perovskite oxide substrates are investigated as a model system. An oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;assisted electronic reconstruction takes place initially at the LNMO polar interfaces. As a result, the magnetic properties of 2&#8211;5 unit cell LNMO films are affected beyond dimensionality effects. The introduction of a top electron&#8208;acceptor layer redistributes the electron excess and restores the ferromagnetic properties of the ultrathin LNMO films. Such a strategy can be extended to other interfaces and provides an advanced approach to fine&#8208;tune the electronic features of complex multilayered heterostructures.

         <title>Enhanced Thermoelectric Properties of Bi2Te3&#8208;Based Micro&#8211;Nano Fibers via Thermal Drawing and Interfacial Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micro&#8211;nano Bi2Te3&#8208;based thermoelectric fibers with an interfacial engineering effect are fabricated by thermal drawing. The 4 &#181;m&#8208;diameter fibers achieve a figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit value (ZT &#8776; 1.4) at 300 K and show a reversible bending radius smaller than 50 &#181;m, approaching the theoretical limit of elastic strain. This fabrication strategy works for large&#8208;scale inorganic thermoelectric materials and benefits the development of fiber&#8208;based thermoelectric devices.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance thermoelectric (TE) materials with great flexibility and stability are urgently needed to efficiently convert heat energy into electrical power. Recently, intrinsically crystalline, mechanically stable, and flexible inorganic TE fibers that show TE properties comparable to their bulk counterparts have been&#160;of interest to researchers. Despite remarkable progress in moving TE fibers toward room&#8208;temperature TE conversion, the figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit value (ZT) and bending stability still need enhancement. Herein, interfacial&#8208;engineering&#8208;enhanced TE properties of micro&#8211;nano polycrystalline TE fibers fabricated by thermally drawing Bi2Te3&#8208;based bulks in a glass&#8208;fiber template are reported. The interfacial engineering effect comes from generating stress&#8208;induced oriented nanocrystals to increase electrical conductivity and producing strain&#8208;distorted interfaces to decrease thermal conductivity. The 4 &#181;m&#8208;diameter fibers achieve a 40% higher ZT (&#8776;1.4 at 300&#160;K) than their bulk counterparts and show a reversible bending radius of 50&#160;&#181;m, approaching the theoretical elastic limit. This fabrication strategy works for a wide range of inorganic TE materials and benefits the development of fiber&#8208;based micro&#8208;TE devices.

         <title>Integrated Urinalysis Devices Based on Interface&#8208;Engineered Field&#8208;Effect Transistor Biosensors Incorporated With Electronic Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular&#8208;specificity electronic device based on an interface&#8208;engineered field&#8208;effect transistor biosensor is engineered for non&#8208;invasive urinalysis. The urinalysis device achieves the reliable identification of five bladder&#8208;tumor&#8208;associated proteins in urine samples. Integrated with a machine&#8208;learning algorithm, the device realizes a 95.0% bladder cancer diagnosis accuracy and can classify cancer stages with a 90.0% accuracy.








Abstract
Urinalysis is attractive in non&#8208;invasive early diagnosis of bladder cancer compared with clinical gold standard cystoscopy. However, the trace bladder tumor biomarkers in urine and the particularly complex urine environment pose significant challenges for urinalysis. Here, a clinically adoptable urinalysis device that integrates molecular&#8208;specificity indium gallium zinc oxide field&#8208;effect transistor (IGZO FET) biosensor arrays, a device control panel, and an internet terminal for directly analyzing five bladder&#8208;tumor&#8208;associated proteins in clinical urine samples, is reported for bladder cancer diagnosis and classification. The IGZO FET biosensors with engineered sensing interfaces provide high sensitivity and selectivity for identification of trace proteins in the complex urine environment. Integrating with a machine&#8208;learning algorithm, this device can identify bladder cancer with an accuracy of 95.0% in a cohort of 197 patients and 75 non&#8208;bladder&#160;cancer individuals, distinguishing cancer stages with an overall accuracy of 90.0% and assessing bladder cancer recurrence after surgical treatment. The non&#8208;invasive urinalysis device defines a robust technology for remote healthcare and personalized medicine.

         <title>Multimode Electron Tomography Sheds Light on Synthesis, Structure, and Properties of Complex Metal&#8208;Based Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced 3D characterization techniques for complex metal&#8208;based nanomaterials by multimode electron tomography are reviewed. Advancements in data acquisition and processing are discussed, in addition to case studies of complex nanomaterials where morphology, elemental distribution, and oxidation states must be understood in 3D to gain crucial insights and drive future design and synthesis of complex nanosystems.








Abstract
Electron tomography has become a cornerstone technique for the visualization of nanoparticle morphology in three dimensions. However, to obtain in&#8208;depth information about a nanoparticle beyond surface faceting and morphology, different electron microscopy signals must be combined. The most notable examples of these combined signals include annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF&#8208;STEM) with different collection angles and the combination of ADF&#8208;STEM with energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray or electron energy loss spectroscopies. Here, the experimental and computational development of various multimode tomography techniques in connection to the fundamental materials science challenges that multimode tomography has been instrumental to overcoming are summarized. Although the techniques can be applied to a wide variety of compositions, the study is restricted to metal and metal oxide nanoparticles for the sake of simplicity. Current challenges and future directions of multimode tomography are additionally discussed.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent advances, strategies, insights, and challenges of data&#8208;driven&#8208;based innovations and applications in material science are discussed. Essential subdisciplines, including framework, machine&#8208;learning algorithms, available chemical databases, commonly used key descriptors, and innovations and applications based on their synergy, are reviewed.








Abstract
Owing to the rapid developments to improve the accuracy and efficiency of both experimental and computational investigative methodologies, the massive amounts of data generated have led the field of materials science into the fourth paradigm of data&#8208;driven scientific research. This transition requires the development of authoritative and up&#8208;to&#8208;date frameworks for data&#8208;driven approaches for material innovation. A critical discussion on the current advances in the data&#8208;driven discovery of materials with a focus on frameworks, machine&#8208;learning algorithms, material&#8208;specific databases, descriptors, and targeted applications in the field of inorganic materials is presented. Frameworks for rationalizing data&#8208;driven material innovation are described, and a critical review of essential subdisciplines is presented, including: i) advanced data&#8208;intensive strategies and machine&#8208;learning algorithms; ii) material databases and related tools and platforms for data generation and management; iii) commonly used molecular descriptors used in data&#8208;driven processes. Furthermore, an in&#8208;depth discussion on the broad applications of material innovation, such as energy conversion and storage, environmental decontamination, flexible electronics, optoelectronics, superconductors, metallic glasses, and magnetic materials, is provided. Finally, how these subdisciplines (with insights into the synergy of materials science, computational tools, and mathematics) support data&#8208;driven paradigms is outlined, and the opportunities and challenges in data&#8208;driven material innovation are highlighted.

         <title>Challenges of Wafer&#8208;Scale Integration of 2D Semiconductors for High&#8208;Performance Transistor Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MX2&#8208;based devices for high&#8208;performance circuits are expected to be introduced in production after the Si&#8208;sheet&#8208;based CFET. A stacked&#8208;sheet MX2 device will look like that prepared by process simulation. The status of the process development needed to produce such a device in a fab environment, and the gaps to be overcome are described.








Abstract
Large&#8208;area 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based devices may find applications as sensor or photonics devices or can be incorporated in the back end of line (BEOL) to provide additional functionality. The introduction of highly scaled 2D&#8208;based circuits for high&#8208;performance logic applications in production is projected to be implemented after the Si&#8208;sheet&#8208;based CFET devices. Here, a view on the requirements needed for full wafer integration of aggressively scaled 2D&#8208;based logic circuits, the status of developments, and the definition of the gaps to be bridged is provided. Today, typical test vehicles for 2D devices are single&#8208;sheet devices fully integrated in a lab environment, but transfer to a more scaled device in a fab environment has been demonstrated. This work reviews the status of the module development, including considerations for setting up fab&#8208;compatible process routes for single&#8208;sheet devices. While further development on key modules is still required, substantial progress is made for MX2 channel growth, high&#8208;k dielectric deposition, and contact engineering. Finally, the process requirements for building ultra&#8208;scaled stacked nanosheets are also reflected on.

         <title>Tumor Selective Metabolic Reprogramming as a Prospective PD&#8208;L1 Depression Strategy to Reactivate Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the role of mitochondria in the programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) regulation in tumors is newly revealed, making it possible to offer a prospective PD&#8208;L1&#160;regulation strategy. Moreover, multi&#8208;functional IR&#8208;LND@Alb platform&#8208;induced tumor&#8208;selective metabolic reprogramming can depress PD&#8208;L1 expression and alleviate tumor hypoxia to reactivate immunotherapy and sensitize photodynamic therapy.








Abstract
Currently, the role of the lysosome, endoplasmic reticulum, or dictyosome in the transcription and translation of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) is well revealed, but the role and function of mitochondria in the PD&#8208;L1&#160;expression in tumors is still not fully researched, making it hard to offer a novel PD&#8208;L1&#160;regulation strategy. In this research, it is newly revealed that mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) depression can be used as an effective PD&#8208;L1&#160;down&#8208;regulation method. To offer an ideal and high&#8208;effective tumor mitochondria&#8208;targeted OXPHOS depression nanosystem, IR&#8208;LND is prepared by conjugating mitochondria&#8208;targeted heptamethine cyanine dye IR&#8208;68&#160;with mitochondrial complexes I and II depression agent lonidamine (LND), which then further self&#8208;assembled with albumin (Alb) to form IR&#8208;LND@Alb nanoparticles. By doing this, PD&#8208;L1&#160;expression in tumors is selectively and effectively depressed by IR&#8208;LND@Alb nanoparticles. As expected, the anti&#8208;tumor efficacy of such a PD&#8208;L1&#160;depression strategy is superior to conventional anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1&#160;monoclonal antibodies. Interestingly, IR&#8208;LND can also be served as a novel ideal promising photodynamic therapy (PDT) drug with self&#8208;oxygen and self&#8208;PD&#8208;L1&#160;regulation capacity. All in all, this tumor&#8208;selective metabolic reprogramming platform to reactivate immunotherapy and sensitize for PDT effect, would open a new window for mitochondrial immunotherapy for cancer patients.

         <title>A Silica&#8208;Reinforced Composite Electrolyte with Greatly Enhanced Interfacial Lithium&#8208;Ion Transfer Kinetics for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte composed of fumed silica and poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene)&#8208;based gel polymer electrolyte is designed and fabricated. Benefiting from the high ionic conductivity, good mechanical strength, homogeneous Li+ flux regulation, and inorganic Li2S&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase, the prepared solid&#8208;like electrolyte enables superb cycling stability of lithium&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Developing quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes with superior ionic conductivity and high mechanical strength is urgently desired to improve the safety and cycling stability of lithium&#8208;metal batteries. Herein, a novel solid&#8208;like electrolyte (SLE) with enhanced Li+ interfacial transfer kinetics is rationally designed by soaking bulk nanostructured silica&#8211;polymer composites in liquid electrolytes. Benefiting from the high content of inorganic silica and abundant interfaces for fast Li+&#8208;transport channels, the prepared SLE exhibits superb ionic conductivity and high mechanical strength. Furthermore, fumed silica with a high specific area in the SLE can homogenize Li+ flux and electrical field gradient. More importantly, a Li2S&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is constructed on the lithium metal due to the intimate ion coordination in the SLE. Therefore, the lithium&#8208;metal anode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance in symmetric Li&#8211;Li cells due to the merits of superior ionic conductivity, high modulus, Li2S&#8208;rich SEI, as well as the homogeneous Li+ flux. Full cells with LiFePO4 cathode can still display&#160;a capacity retention of 98% at 0.2&#8201;C after 400 cycles. The proposed strategy on quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes provides a promising avenue for next&#8208;generation metal&#8208;based batteries.

         <dc:description>
The wide&#8208;angle field&#8208;of&#8208;view (FOV) cameras (fish eye camera and compound eye camera) simultaneously exhibiting low distortion and high spatial resolution is still a huge challenge. To solve this problem, a new type of wide&#8208;angle FOV camera is developed by combining a single large&#8208;area flexible perovskite&#8208;based photodetector and computational technology.








Abstract
Researchers have attempted to create wide&#8208;angle field&#8208;of&#8208;view (FOV) cameras inspired by the structure of the eyes of animals, including fisheye and compound eye cameras. However, realizing wide&#8208;angle FOV cameras simultaneously exhibiting low distortion and high spatial resolution remains a significant challenge. In this study, a novel wide&#8208;angle FOV camera is developed by combining a single large&#8208;area flexible perovskite photodetector (FP&#8208;PD) using computational technology. With this camera, the proposed single&#8208;photodetector imaging technique can obtain high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution images using only a single detector, and the large&#8208;area FP&#8208;PD can be bent further to collect light from a wide&#8208;angle FOV. The proposed camera demonstrates remarkable features of an extraordinarily tunable wide FOV (greater than 150&#176;), high spatial resolution of 256&#160;&#215;&#160;256 pixels, and low distortion. It is believed that the proposed compatible and extensible camera prototype will promote the development of high&#8208;performance versatile FOV cameras.

         <title>Tropocollagen&#8208;Inspired Hierarchical Spiral Structure of Organic Fibers in Epoxy Bulk for 3D High Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully organic yet 3D thermoconductive bulk material is fabricated via weaving the hierarchical spiral poly(p&#8208;phenylene benzobisoxazole) fibers into an epoxy matrix. Significantly, not only the hierarchical molecular, spiral, and weaving structure of poly(p&#8208;phenylene benzobisoxazole), but also the bridging noncrystalline chains enable spatially phonon transport. This paves the way for fully organic materials in the fields of advanced thermal management.








Abstract
Polymers are usually considered thermal insulators; however, significant enhancements in thermal conductivity (k) have been observed in oriented fibers and films. Despite being advantageous in real&#8208;world applications, extending the linear thermal&#8208;transport advantage of polymers into the 3D space in bulk materials is still limited due to the spatially interfacial phonon&#8208;conduction barriers. Herein, inspired by the structure of tropocollagen, it is discovered that weaving hierarchically arranged poly(p&#8208;phenylene benzobisoxazole) (PBO) fibers with a spiral configuration into an epoxy matrix can yield a 3D continuous thermal pathway. This achieves both a through&#8208;plane k of 10.85&#160;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1 and an in&#8208;plane k of 7.15&#160;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1. Theoretical molecular simulations in combination with classical nonlinear modeling attribute the above spatially thermally conductive achievement to not only the hierarchical molecular, spiral and weaving structure of PBO, but also the noncrystalline chains that carry overlapping phonon density of states, thus thermally bridging adjacent high&#8208;k crystals in the PBO fiber. Consequently, the interfacial thermal resistance among high&#8208;k PBO crystals is suppressed to be on the order of 10&#8722;10&#8201;m2&#8201;K&#8201;W&#8722;1 in both the through&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane directions. Other advantages include being lightweight, mechanically strong, flexible, and non&#8208;combustible. This material creates opportunities for organic polymers in high&#8208;performance thermal management applications.

         <dc:description>
An holistic analysis on the recent developments of solid&#8208;state phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) for innovative thermal&#8208;energy storage (TES) applications. The phase&#8208;transition fundamentals of solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid (S&#8211;S) PCMs are introduced and discussed, developing strategies and molecular engineering design toward potential applications. The current challenges and future research directions on S&#8211;S PCMs in TES applications are also proposed.








Abstract
Phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) offer tremendous potential to store thermal energy during reversible phase transitions for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications. The practicality of these materials is adversely restricted by volume expansion, phase segregation, and leakage problems associated with conventional solid&#8208;liquid PCMs. Solid&#8211;solid PCMs, as promising alternatives to solid&#8211;liquid PCMs, are gaining much attention toward practical thermal&#8208;energy storage (TES) owing to their inimitable advantages such as solid&#8208;state processing, negligible volume change during phase transition, no contamination, and long cyclic life. Herein, the aim is to provide a holistic analysis of solid&#8211;solid PCMs suitable for thermal&#8208;energy harvesting, storage, and utilization. The developing strategies of solid&#8211;solid PCMs are presented and then the structure&#8211;property relationship is discussed, followed by potential applications. Finally, an outlook discussion with momentous challenges and future directions is presented. Hopefully, this review will provide a guideline to the scientific community to develop high&#8208;performance solid&#8211;solid PCMs for advanced TES applications.

         <title>An Irradiance&#8208;Adaptable Near&#8208;Infrared Vertical Heterojunction Phototransistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared phototransistor using the graphene/lead sulfide quantum dots/graphene heterojunction as the conductive channel is fabricated. The device demonstrates an intense gate voltage&#8208;dependent photoresponse. The dynamic trapping and de&#8208;trapping processes in the quantum dot film enable the inhabitation or potentiation of the photoresponse, based on which the photopic or scotopic adaptation behavior of the human retina is successfully mimicked, respectively.








Abstract
Bioinspired artificial visual perception devices with the optical environment&#8208;adaptable function have attracted significant attention for their promising potential in applications like robotics and machine vision. In this regard, a photodetector with in&#8208;sensor adaptability is longed for in terms of complexity, efficiency, and cost. Here, a near&#8208;infrared phototransistor with a benign light irradiance&#8208;adaptability is presented. The phototransistor uses a vertically stacking graphene/lead sulfide quantum dots/graphene heterojunction as the conductive channel. Compared with ordinary lead sulfide quantum dots&#8208;decorated graphene phototransistors, the present device demonstrates a faster photoresponse speed and an abnormal transfer characteristic. The latter characteristic is induced by the gate voltage&#8208;tunable Fermi level in the heterojunction and the abundant electron trap states in the quantum dot film, which jointly results in an intense dependence of the photoresponse on the gate voltage. The dynamic trapping and de&#8208;trapping processes in the quantum dot film enable the inhabitation or potentiation of the photoresponse, based on which the photopic or scotopic adaptation behavior of the human retina is successfully mimicked, respectively. By providing an irradiance&#8208;adaptable photodetector with a spectral response beyond visible light, this work should inspire future research on artificial environment&#8208;adaptable perception devices.

         <title>In Situ Silver&#8208;based Electrochemical Oncolytic Bioreactor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tumor microenvironment&#8208;enabled in situ silver&#8208;based electrochemical oncolytic bioreactor has been established to unlock anti&#8208;tumor Ag+ prodrugs for highly&#8208;efficient subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor recession via activating reactive oxygen species production, wherein reduced graphene oxide featuring 20&#8208;fold larger catalysis rate than graphene oxide allows intratumoral H2O2 as reductants to reduce Ag+ into silver nanoparticles especially after uniting with VitC&#8208;mediated H2O2 production.








Abstract
In this study, it is shown for the first time that a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) carrier has a 20&#8208;fold higher catalysis rate than graphene oxide in Ag+ reduction. Based on this, a tumor microenvironment&#8208;enabled in situ silver&#8208;based electrochemical oncolytic bioreactor (SEOB) which switched Ag+ prodrugs into in situ therapeutic silver nanoparticles with and above 95% transition rate is constructed to inhibit the growths of various tumors. In this SEOB&#8208;enabled intratumoral nanosynthetic medicine, intratumoral H2O2 and rGO act as the reductant and the catalyst, respectively. Chelation of aptamers to the SEOB&#8208;unlocked prodrugs increases the production of silver nanoparticles in tumor cells, especially in the presence of Vitamin C, which is broken down in tumor cells to supply massive amounts of H2O2. Consequently, apoptosis and pyroptosis are induced to cooperatively contribute to the considerably&#8208;elevated anti&#8208;tumor effects on subcutaneous HepG2 and A549 tumors and orthotopic implanted HepG2 tumors in livers of nude mice. The specific aptamer targeting and intratumoral silver nanoparticle production guarantee excellent biosafety since it fails to elicit tissue damages in monkeys, which greatly increases the clinical translation potential of the SEOB system.

&lt;p&gt;In this study, it is shown for the first time that a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) carrier has a 20-fold higher catalysis rate than graphene oxide in Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; reduction. Based on this, a tumor microenvironment-enabled in situ silver-based electrochemical oncolytic bioreactor (SEOB) which switched Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; prodrugs into in situ therapeutic silver nanoparticles with and above 95% transition rate is constructed to inhibit the growths of various tumors. In this SEOB-enabled intratumoral nanosynthetic medicine, intratumoral H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and rGO act as the reductant and the catalyst, respectively. Chelation of aptamers to the SEOB-unlocked prodrugs increases the production of silver nanoparticles in tumor cells, especially in the presence of Vitamin C, which is broken down in tumor cells to supply massive amounts of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Consequently, apoptosis and pyroptosis are induced to cooperatively contribute to the considerably-elevated anti-tumor effects on subcutaneous HepG2 and A549 tumors and orthotopic implanted HepG2 tumors in livers of nude mice. The specific aptamer targeting and intratumoral silver nanoparticle production guarantee excellent biosafety since it fails to elicit tissue damages in monkeys, which greatly increases the clinical translation potential of the SEOB system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unbreakable Hydrogels with Self&#8208;Recoverable 10&#8239;200% Stretchability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unbreakable networks are simply constructed in hydrogels via copolymerization of divinyl benzene micellar with acrylamide. The network provides both dynamic hydrophobic association for recoverable small deformations and homogeneous crosslinking for reversible alignment of polymer chains to resist ultra&#8208;large deformations without crack propagations. The resultant hydrogels exhibit self&#8208;recoverable 102 times stretchability, and superior resistance of fracture and fatigue.








Abstract
Design of tough hydrogels maintaining structural integrity under multivariable mechanical loads remains hugely challenging because the anticipated characteristics such as stretchability, strength, toughness, and fracture resistance can hardly be compatible. Herein, a simple but robust hydrogel network formed by copolymerization of divinyl benzene with acrylamide in micellar solutions for ultra&#8208;high fracture resistance and self&#8208;recoverable stretchability is proposed. The network provides dynamic association of hydrophobic domains and homogeneous crosslinking of hydrophilic chains, which shows step&#8208;by&#8208;step deformation process. The dynamic associations allow recoverable small deformations, then the homogeneous crosslinking ensures reversible unfolding and alignment of polymer chains to self&#8208;strengthen for ultra&#8208;large deformations without crack propagations. The resultant hydrogels exhibit comprehensive unbreakable feature with self&#8208;recoverable ultra&#8208;high stretchability (100% recovery from 10&#8239;200% strain), superior fracture resistance (toughness &gt; 26&#160;kJ m&#8722;2), and anticrack propagation and fatigue (fatigue threshold: &#8776;2.5&#160;kJ m&#8722;2). Even the prenotched hydrogels can undergo tens cyclic loads at 10&#8239;200% strain and thousands cyclic loads at 200% strain without noticeable changes in mechanical performance. The robust network prepared from homogeneous hydrophobic crosslinking provides a facile approach and a new mechanism to explore tough hydrogels with superior antifracture and extreme self&#8208;recoverable deformability for diverse applications.

         <title>A Novel Multi&#8208;Sulfur Source Collaborative Chemical Bath Deposition Technology Enables 8%&#8208;Efficiency Sb2S3 Planar Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sb2S3 planar solar cell with a power conversion efficiency first exceeding 8% is achieved based on the high&#8208;quality Sb2S3 absorber film fabricated using a novel multi&#8208;sulfur source collaborative chemical bath deposition technology.








Abstract
Sb2S3 as a light&#8208;harvesting material has attracted great attention for applications in both single&#8208;junction and tandem solar cells. Such solar cell has been faced with current challenge of low power conversion efficiency (PCE), which has stagnated for 8 years. It has been recognized that the synthesis of high&#8208;quality absorber film plays a critical role in efficiency improvement. Here, using fresh precursor materials for antimony (antimony potassium tartrate) and combined sulfur (sodium thiosulfate and thioacetamide), a unique chemical bath deposition procedure is created. Due to the complexation of sodium thiosulfate and the advantageous hydrolysis cooperation between these two sulfur sources, the heterogeneous nucleation and the S2&#8208; releasing processes are boosted. As a result, there are noticeable improvements in the deposition rate, film morphology, crystallinity, and preferred orientations. Additionally, the improved film quality efficiently lowers charge trapping capacity, suppresses carrier recombination, and prolongs carrier lifetimes, leading to significantly improved photoelectric properties. Ultimately, the PCE exceeds 8% for the first time since 2014, representing the highest efficiency in all kinds of Sb2S3 solar cells to date. This study is expected to shed new light on the fabrication of high&#8208;quality Sb2S3 film and further efficiency improvement in Sb2S3 solar cells.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Homogeneous Ru&#63743;Cu Alloy Nanoparticles for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomic&#8208;scale homogeneous alloy of immiscible metals is first implemented in electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction (NRR) by a unique carbothermal shock method. Atomic&#8208;scale mixing of ruthenium and copper facilitates pivotal reaction steps in NRR, showing high selectivity and formation rate to ammonia. This paves the way for developing numerous potential homogeneous alloys of immiscible metal combinations for future efficient NRR electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Ruthenium (Ru) is the most widely used metal as an electrocatalyst for nitrogen (N2) reduction reaction (NRR) because of the relatively high N2 adsorption strength for successive reaction. Recently, it has been well reported that the homogeneous Ru&#8208;based metal alloys such as Ru&#63743;Rh, Ru&#63743;Pt, and Ru&#63743;Co significantly enhance the selectivity and formation rate of ammonia (NH3). However, the metal combinations for NRR have been limited to several miscible combinations of metals with Ru, although various immiscible combinations have immense potential to show high NRR performance. In this study, an immiscible combination of Ru and copper (Cu) is first utilized, and homogeneous alloy nanoparticles (Ru&#63743;Cu NPs) are fabricated by the carbothermal shock method. The Ru&#63743;Cu homogeneous NP alloys on cellulose/carbon nanotube sponge exhibit the highest selectivity and NH3 formation rate of &#8776;31% and &#8722;73&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, respectively. These are the highest values of the selectivity and NH3 formation rates among existing Ru&#8208;based alloy metal combinations.

         <title>Fully Textured, Production&#8208;Line Compatible Monolithic Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells Approaching 29% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin hybrid hole transporting layer&#160;employing NiOx/[2&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) ethyl]phosphonic acid enables complete and uniform coverage on fully textured indium tin oxide (ITO)/silicon surface with pyramid structures of 2&#8211;5&#160;&#181;m sizes. As a result of the depleted shunt pathways between ITO and perovskite top cell, a certified record efficiency&#8212;28.84%&#8212;is achieved on perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with fully textured, production&#8208;line compatible bottom silicon wafers.








Abstract
Perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells are promising avenues for achieving high&#8208;performance photovoltaics with low costs. However, the highest certified efficiency of perovskite/silicon tandem devices based on economically matured silicon heterojunction technology (SHJ) with fully textured wafer is only 25.2% due to incompatibility between the limitation of fabrication technology which is not compatible with the production&#8208;line silicon wafer. Here, a molecular&#8208;level nanotechnology is developed by designing NiOx/2PACz ([2&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) ethyl]phosphonic acid) as an ultrathin hybrid hole transport layer (HTL) above indium tin oxide (ITO)&#160;recombination junction, to serve as a vital pivot for achieving a conformal deposition of high&#8208;quality perovskite layer on top. The NiOx interlayer facilitates a uniform self&#8208;assembly of 2PACz molecules onto the fully textured surface, thus avoiding direct contact between ITO and perovskite top&#8208;cell for a minimal shunt loss. As a result of such interfacial engineering, the fully textured perovskite/silicon tandem cells obtain a certified efficiency of 28.84% on a 1.2&#8208;cm2 masked area, which is the highest performance to date based on the fully textured, production&#8208;line compatible SHJ. This work advances commercially promising photovoltaics with high performance and low costs by adopting a meticulously designed HTL/perovskite interface.

This work advances commercially promising photovoltaics with high performance and low costs by adopting a meticulously designed HTL/perovskite interface.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineered Bacterial Outer Membrane Vesicles as Controllable Two&#8208;Way Adaptors to Activate Macrophage Phagocytosis for Improved Tumor Immunotherapy</title>

An outer membrane vesicle (OMV)&#8208;based controllable PEG/Se@OMV&#8208;CD47nb remarkedly increase the dose that can be administered safely through intravenous injection. As two&#8208;way adaptors, OMV&#8208;CD47nb activate tumor&#8208;associated macrophage (TAM) phagocytosis of tumor cells via inducing M1 polarization and blocking &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal. Moreover, this activation of TAMs results in the stimulation of T cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity through effective antigen presentation.








Abstract
The most immune cells infiltrating tumor microenvironment (TME), tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) closely resemble immunosuppressive M2&#8208;polarized macrophages. Moreover, tumor cells exhibit high expression of CD47 &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal, which obstructs macrophage phagocytosis. The precise and efficient activation of TAMs is a promising approach to tumor immunotherapy; however, re&#8208;education of macrophages remains a challenge. Bacteria&#8208;derived outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are highly immunogenic nanovesicles that can robustly stimulate macrophages. Here, an OMV&#8208;based controllable two&#8208;way adaptor is reported, in which a CD47 nanobody (CD47nb) is fused onto OMV surface (OMV&#8208;CD47nb), with the outer surface coated with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) layer containing diselenide bonds (PEG/Se) to form PEG/Se@OMV&#8208;CD47nb. The PEG/Se layer modification not only mitigates the immunogenicity of OMV&#8208;CD47nb, thereby remarkedly increasing the dose that can be administered safely through intravenous injection, but also equips the formulation with radiation&#8208;triggered controlled release of OMV&#8208;CD47nb. Application of radiation to tumors in mice injected with the nanoformulation results in remodeling of TME. As two&#8208;way adaptors, OMV&#8208;CD47nb activates TAM phagocytosis of tumor cells via multiple pathways, including induction of M1 polarization and blockade of &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal. Moreover, this activation of TAMs results in the stimulation of T cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity through effective antigen presentation.

         <title>Mass Transfer Printing of Metal&#8208;Halide Perovskite Films and Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust transfer&#8208;printing method is developed using an ultrathin chemical bonding interfacial layer. The transfer&#8208;printed perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) exhibit similar performance as optimized spin&#8208;coated LEDs, and the transfer&#8208;printed nanostructure reaches a high resolution up to 1270 ppi. A white perovskite LED structure is finally demonstrated with laterally aligned red and sky&#8208;blue perovskite microstripes made by the multiple transfer&#8208;printing process.








Abstract
Most methods of depositing perovskite films cannot meet the diverse requirements of real applications such as depositing films on various types of substrates, making patterns with different bandgaps for full&#8208;color display. Here, a robust mass transfer method of perovskite films and nanostructures is reported, meeting those requirements, by using an ultrathin branched polyethylenimine as interfacial chemical bonding layers. The transfer&#8208;printed perovskite films exhibit comparable morphology, composition, optoelectronic properties, and device performances with the counterparts made by optimized spin&#8208;coating methods. The perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) using the transfer&#8208;printed films show decent external quantum efficiencies of 10.5% and 6.7% for red (680&#160;nm) and sky&#8208;blue (493&#160;nm) emissions, which are similar to the devices made by spin&#8208;coating. This robust transfer printing method also enables the the preparation of perovskite micropatterns with a high resolution up to 1270 pixels per inch. Horizontally aligned red and sky&#8208;blue perovskite microstripes are further obtained through multiple printing processes for white PeLEDs. This work demonstrates a feasible strategy for making perovskite films or micropatterns on various substrates for real applications in full&#8208;color display, white LEDs, lasing, etc.

         <title>Highly Sensitive Photoelectric Detection and Imaging Enhanced by the Pyro&#8208;Phototronic Effect Based on a Photoinduced Dynamic Schottky Effect in 4H&#8208;SiC</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance self&#8208;powered 4H&#8208;SiC ultraviolet photodetector is realized using a strong photoinduced dynamic Schottky effect, and the pyro&#8208;phototronic effect is first revealed in N&#8208;doped 4H&#8208;SiC, which is beneficial to further enhance the photodetection performance. Moreover, via delicate position designs of electrodes, the 4H&#8208;SiC chip reveals efficient optical imaging and information transmission capabilities.








Abstract
Silicon carbide (SiC), one of the third&#8208;generation semiconductor materials with excellent electrical and optoelectronic properties, is ideal for high light&#8208;sensing performance. Here, a self&#8208;powered SiC ultraviolet (UV) photodetector (PD) is constructed with wider applicability and higher commercialization potential. The great performance of the PD is realized by a remarkable photoinduced dynamic Schottky effect derived from the symbiotic modulation of Schottky and Ohmic contact. Using the pyro&#8208;phototronic effect that exists in the N&#8208;doped 4H&#8208;SiC single crystal PDs, a fast pyroelectric response time of 0.27 s is achieved, which is almost ten times shorter than that obtained from the steady&#8208;state signal under UV illumination. The maximal transient photoresponsivity reaches 9.12 nA mW&#8722;1, which is &#8776;20% higher than the conventional photoelectric signal. Moreover, different regions of the 4H&#8208;SiC centimeter&#8208;scale chip output distinct signals under UV illumination, demonstrating efficient optical imaging and information transmission capabilities of this device. This work not only reveals the fundamental optoelectronic physics lying in this vital third&#8208;generation semiconductor, but also sheds light on its potential photosensing applications for large&#8208;scale commercialization.

         <title>Anode Catalysts in Anion&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Membrane Electrolysis without Supporting Electrolyte: Conductivity, Dynamics, and Ionomer Degradation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To reach the required scale for green hydrogen, it must be produced with efficient, low&#8208;capital&#8208;expense electrolyzers using non&#8208;platinum&#8208;group catalysts. In this work, oxygen&#8208;evolution catalysts in pure&#8208;water anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzer devices are studied. Processes causing device failure are illustrated, nano&#8208;Co3O4 is shown to be a viable catalyst, and design rules for engineering catalyst/ionomer layers with higher performance and durability are proposed.








Abstract
Anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) in principle operate without soluble electrolyte using earth&#8208;abundant catalysts and cell materials and thus lower the cost of green H2. Current systems lack competitive performance and the durability needed for commercialization. One critical issue is a poor understanding of catalyst&#8208;specific degradation processes in the electrolyzer. While non&#8208;platinum&#8208;group&#8208;metal (non&#8208;PGM) oxygen&#8208;evolution catalysts show excellent performance and durability in strongly alkaline electrolyte, this has not transferred directly to pure&#8208;water AEMWEs. Here, AEMWEs with five non&#8208;PGM anode catalysts are built and the catalysts&#8217; structural stability and interactions with the alkaline ionomer are characterized during electrolyzer operation and post&#8208;mortem. The results show catalyst electrical conductivity is one key to obtaining high&#8208;performing systems and that many non&#8208;PGM catalysts restructure during operation. Dynamic Fe sites correlate with enhanced degradation rates, as does the addition of soluble Fe impurities. In contrast, electronically conductive Co3O4 nanoparticles (without Fe in the crystal structure) yield AEMWEs from simple, standard preparation methods, with performance and stability comparable to IrO2. These results reveal the fundamental dynamic catalytic processes resulting in AEMWE device failure under relevant conditions, demonstrate a viable non&#8208;PGM catalyst for AEMWE operation, and illustrate underlying design rules for engineering anode catalyst/ionomer layers with higher performance and durability.

         <title>Volatile Organic Compound Sensing Array and Optoelectronic Filter System using Ion&#8208;Pairing Dyes with a Wide Visible Spectrum</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brief methodology to synthesize sensing materials (e.g., ion&#8208;paring dyes) with hydrophobicity, ease of color tunability, and a wide visible spectrum is suggested. This can simplify the sensing array, thereby producing a color map distinguishing functional groups as well as carbon chain lengths. The ion&#8208;pairing dyes will be extended to the electronic system promising the safety and health of the user.








Abstract
An ideal dye&#8208;based sensing array has essential design requirements, including facile preparation methodology, tolerance to water vapor, a broad range of color&#8208;responsive changes, and a simple readout system. Here, a brief synthetic route is developed for ion&#8208;pairing dyes exhibiting unusual chromatic changes across the entire visible spectrum. It requires only mixing and precipitation under mild conditions. The dyes are applied to a sensing array containing 12 sensing elements with different initial states. Owing to the numerous color variations of the dyes, the color map generated by the array is highly simple yet sufficiently accurate to distinguish among the different functional groups (such as amines, aldehydes, and carboxylic acids) as well as carbon chain lengths. Principle component analysis (PCA) demonstrates that volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can be well classified according to the color changes of the sensing array. The ion&#8208;pairing dyes are embedded into&#160;3D&#160;stacked nanofibers via electrospinning, and function as effective harmful&#8208;gas (e.g., formaldehyde) sensors with sub&#8208;ppm theoretical detection limits (0.15&#160;ppm). Finally, the 3D stacked nanofibers can be employed in an optoelectronic filter system that automatically checks for formaldehyde in the surroundings and also confirms the effective removal of the detected formaldehyde by the gas filter cartridge.

         <title>Photoactivatable Silencing Extracellular Vesicle (PASEV) Sensitizes Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoactivatable silencing extracellular vesicle is developed, which not only serves as a nanocarrier for packaging, tumor accumulation, and intracellular release of small interfering RNA against p21&#8208;activated kinase 4 to boost intratumoral&#160;immune infiltration, but also is able to initiate antitumor immunity through immunogenic phototherapy. The combined immunotherapy between boosted immune infiltration and immune activation elicits superior antitumor outcome.








Abstract
Immunotherapy has delivered impressive outcomes in combating tumor malignancies. However, insufficient immune infiltration and poor immunogenicity within the tumor microenvironment (TME) greatly compromise patient response rates. Here, a photoactivatable silencing extracellular vesicle (PASEV) is developed for sensitized cancer immunotherapy. p21&#8208;Activated kinase 4 (PAK4) is a newly identified tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;intrinsic &#8220;guard&#8221; associated with immune exclusion. Small interfering RNA against PAK4 (siPAK4) is designed and assembled with a photoactivatable reactive&#8208;oxygen&#8208;species (ROS)&#8208;sensitive polymer to form the nanocomplex core, which is further camouflaged by extracellular vesicles from M1 macrophages. The PASEV not only serves as a vehicle for packaging, tumor accumulation, and ROS&#8208;responsive release of siPAK4 for potent PAK4 silencing, but also primes the TME through immunogenic phototherapy, thereby simultaneously boosting intratumoral infiltration and immune activation. The combined immunotherapy elicits robust anticancer immunity, thus showing great promise for fighting cancers. This work opens a new avenue to simultaneously boost intratumoral infiltration and immune activation for sensitized cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>A Room&#8208;Temperature Ferroelectric Resonant Tunneling Diode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust room&#8208;temperature ferroelectric modulated resonant tunneling and negative differential resistance (NDR) behaviors under external voltage in perovskite oxide BaTiO3/SrRuO3/BaTiO3 quantum&#8208;well structures are reported. The NDR ratio can be modified by &#8776;3 orders of magnitude, depending on the polarization states of the ferroelectric barrier, and a large OFF/ON resistance ratio up to 23 000 is obtained.








Abstract
Resonant tunneling is a quantum&#8208;mechanical effect in which electron transport is controlled by the discrete energy levels within a quantum&#8208;well (QW) structure. A ferroelectric resonant tunneling diode (RTD) exploits the switchable electric polarization state of the QW barrier to tune the device resistance. Here, the discovery of robust room&#8208;temperature ferroelectric&#8208;modulated resonant tunneling and negative differential resistance (NDR) behaviors in all&#8208;perovskite&#8208;oxide BaTiO3/SrRuO3/BaTiO3 QW structures is reported. The resonant current amplitude and voltage are tunable by the switchable polarization of the BaTiO3 ferroelectric with the NDR ratio modulated by &#8776;3 orders of magnitude and an OFF/ON resistance ratio exceeding a factor of 2&#160;&#215;&#160;104. The observed NDR effect is explained an energy bandgap between Ru&#8208;t2g and Ru&#8208;eg orbitals driven by electron&#8211;electron correlations, as follows from density functional theory calculations. This study paves the way for ferroelectric&#8208;based quantum&#8208;tunneling devices in future oxide electronics.

         <title>Excimer Formation in the Non&#8208;Van&#8208;Der&#8208;Waals 2D Semiconductor Bi2O2Se</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excimer formation is unambiguously demonstrated in non&#8208;van der Waals 2D semiconductor Bi2O2Se via transient absorption spectroscopy. The excimer in Bi2O2Se nanosheets is diffusive and its formation can be described as excitons relax to an excimer geometry driven by the ultrafast photoscreening of the intrinsic built&#8208;in dipolar electric field.








Abstract
The layered semiconductor Bi2O2Se is a promising new&#8208;type 2D material that holds layered structure via electrostatic forces instead of van der Waals (vdW) attractions. Aside from the huge success in device performance, the non&#8208;vdW nature in Bi2O2Se with a built&#8208;in interlayer electric field has also provided an appealing platform for investigating unique photoexcited carrier dynamics. Here, experimental evidence for the observation of excimers in multilayer Bi2O2Se nanosheets via transient absorption spectroscopy is presented. It is found that the excimer formation is the primary decay pathway of photoexcited excitons and three&#8208;stage excimer dynamics with corresponding time scales are established. Excitation&#8208;fluence&#8208;dependent excimer dynamics further suggest that the excimer is diffusive and its formation can be simply described as excitons relaxed to an excimer geometry. This work indicates the outstanding promise of unique excitonic processes in Bi2O2Se, which may motivate novel device designs.

         <title>Instantaneous High&#8208;Resolution Visual Imaging of Latent Fingerprints in Water Using Color&#8208;Tunable AIE Pincer Complexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The instantaneous visualization of latent fingerprints (LFPs) is developed by using a series of water&#8208;soluble terpyridine zinc complexes as aggregation&#8208;induced emission probes in pure water under UV light or ambient sunlight. Remarkably, LFPs can be visualized within seconds including details at the Level 3, shedding light on the potential security protection and criminal investigation in various scenarios.








Abstract
Instant visualization of latent fingerprints is developed by using a series of water&#8208;soluble terpyridine zinc complexes as aggregation&#8208;induced emission probes in pure water, under UV light or ambient sunlight. By simply soaking, or spraying with an aqueous solution of the probe, bright yellow fluorescence images with high contrast and resolution are readily developed on various surfaces including tinfoil, glass, paper, steel, leather, and ceramic tile. Remarkably, latent fingerprints can be visualized within seconds including details of whorl and sweat pores. The color of emission can be tuned from blue to orange by modifying the pincer ligands, allowing direct imaging under sunlight.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Responsive Magnetoactive and Electro&#8211;Ionic Soft Actuator Derived from a Nickel&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magnetically and electrically driven dual&#8208;responsive soft actuator is presented by an engineering of unprecedented nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Ni&#8208;MOF). It can nurture the complex motion for relevant robotic interaction. The magneto&#8211;electro&#8208;ionic soft actuator obtained from the newly developed Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;derived active material is successfully utilized to demonstrate hovering motion of a hummingbird robot under magnetic and electrical stimuli.








Abstract
There is growing demand for multiresponsive soft actuators for the realization of natural, safe, and complex motions in robotic interactions. In particular, soft actuators simultaneously stimulated by electrical and magnetic fields are always under development owing to their simple controllability and reliability during operation. Herein, magnetically and electrically driven dual&#8208;responsive soft actuators (MESAs) derived from novel nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ni&#8208;MOFs&#8208;700C), are reported. Nanoscale Ni&#8208;MOFs&#8208;700C has excellent electrochemical and magnetic properties that allow it to be used as a multifunctional material under both magnetoactive and electro&#8208;ionic actuations. The dual&#8208;responsive MESA exhibits a bending displacement of 30&#160;mm and an ultrafast rising time of 1.5 s under a very low input voltage of 1&#160;V and also exerts a bending deflection of 12.5&#160;mm at 50 mT under a high excitation frequency of 5&#160;Hz. By utilizing a dual&#8208;responsive MESA, the hovering motion of a hummingbird robot is demonstrated under magnetic and electrical stimuli.

         <title>Semicrystalline Conjugated Polymers with Well&#8208;Defined Active Sites for Nitrogen Fixation in a Seawater Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;quasi&#8208;gas&#8211;solid&#8221; interface is well constructed by introducing a suitable semicrystalline structure in donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;based conjugated polymers to significantly boost the nitrogen reduction reaction with a high Faradaic efficiency of 60.5% and a maximum NH3 yield rate of 16.8&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 in a neutral&#8208;buffered seawater electrolyte.








Abstract
Faradaic efficiency for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is often limited by low N2 solubility in the electrolyte, while a large number of intimate contacts between the electrolyte and solid catalyst can also inevitably sacrifice many active sites for the NRR. Here, it is reported that a &#8220;quasi&#8208;gas&#8211;solid&#8221; interface formed in donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;based conjugated polymers (CPs) is beneficial to boosting the NRR process and at the same time suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. Of particular interest, it is found that a semicrystalline CP catalyst, SC&#8208;PBDT&#8208;TT, exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency of up to 60.5% with a maximum NH3 production rate of 16.8&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 in a neutral&#8208;buffered seawater electrolyte. Molecular dynamics and COMSOL Multiphysics simulations reveal the origin of the observed high NRR performance arising from the presence of desirable crystal regions to resist the penetration of H2O molecules, leading to the formation of a &#8220;quasi&#8208;gas&#8211;solid&#8221; interface inside the catalyst for a favorable direct&#8208;contact between the catalyst and N2 molecules. Furthermore, high&#8208;throughput computations, based on density functional theory, reveal the actual real active site for N2 adsorption and reduction in SC&#8208;PBDT&#8208;TT. This work provides a new framework for optimizing NRR performance of metal&#8208;free catalysts by controlling their crystallinities.

         <title>Endocytosis&#8208;Independent and Cancer&#8208;Selective Cytosolic Protein Delivery via Reversible Tagging with LAT1 substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pro&#8208;protein approach is developed based on reversible tagging with l&#8208;type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) substrate, which enables carrier&#8208;free, cancer&#8208;selective, and endocytosis&#8208;independent cytosolic delivery via LAT1&#8208;mediated direct transport. It demonstrates high generality and robust efficiency for varieties of functional proteins, including enzymes, toxins, antibodies, and CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 ribonucleoprotein. This facile and versatile platform holds transformative potentials in protein pharmaceuticals.








Abstract
Protein drugs targeting intracellular machineries have shown profound therapeutic potentials, but their clinical utilities are greatly hampered by the lack of efficient cytosolic delivery techniques. Existing strategies mainly rely on nanocarriers or conjugated cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs), which often have drawbacks such as materials complexity/toxicity, lack of cell specificity, and endolysosomal entrapment. Herein, a unique carrier&#8208;free approach is reported for mediating cancer&#8208;selective and endocytosis&#8208;free cytosolic protein delivery. Proteins are sequentially modified with 4&#8208;nitrophenyl 4&#8208;(4,4,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;dioxaborolan&#8208;2&#8208;yl) benzyl carbonate as the H2O2&#8208;responsive domain and 3,4&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;l&#8208;phenylalanine as the substrate of l&#8208;type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1). Thus, the pro&#8208;protein can be directly transported into tumor cells by overexpressed LAT1 on cell membranes, bypassing endocytosis and endolysosomal entrapment. In the cytosol, overproduced H2O2 restores the protein structure and activity. Using this technique, versatile proteins are delivered into tumor cells with robust efficiency, including toxins, enzymes, CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 ribonucleoprotein, and antibodies. Furthermore, intravenously injected pro&#8208;protein of saporin shows potent anticancer efficacy in 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice, without provoking systemic toxicity. Such a facile and versatile pro&#8208;protein platform may benefit the development of protein pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Multiscale Functional Metal Architectures by Antibody&#8208;Guided Metallization of Specific Protein Assemblies in Ex Vivo Multicellular Organisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of metallic structures mimicking the specific protein assemblies in multicellular organisms, such as human cells and animal tissue, is demonstrated via antibody&#8211;antigen interactions and electroless deposition. This work enables the use of diverse protein structures that are arranged in unique 3D geometries optimized for certain functions as scaffolds for biotemplating.








Abstract
Biological systems consist of hierarchical protein structures, each of which has unique 3D&#160;geometries optimized for specific functions. In the past decades, the growth of inorganic materials on specific proteins has attracted considerable attention. However, the use of specific proteins as templates has only been demonstrated in relatively simple organisms, such as viruses, limiting the range of structures that can be used as scaffolds. This study proposes a method for synthesizing metallic structures that resemble the 3D assemblies of specific proteins in mammalian cells and animal tissues. Using 1.4 nm nanogold&#8208;conjugated antibodies, specific proteins within cells and ex vivo tissues are labeled, and then the nanogold acts as nucleation sites for growth of metal particles. As proof of concept, various metal particles are grown using microtubules in cells as templates. The metal&#8208;containing cells are applied as catalysts and show catalytic stability in liquid&#8208;phase reactions due to the rigid support provided by the microtubules. Finally, this method is used to produce metal structures that replicate the specific protein assemblies of neurons in the mouse brain or the extracellular matrices in the mouse kidney and heart. This new biotemplating approach can facilitate the conversion of specific protein structures into metallic forms in ex vivo multicellular organisms.

&lt;p&gt;Biological systems consist of hierarchical protein structures, each of which has unique 3D&#160;geometries optimized for specific functions. In the past decades, the growth of inorganic materials on specific proteins has attracted considerable attention. However, the use of specific proteins as templates has only been demonstrated in relatively simple organisms, such as viruses, limiting the range of structures that can be used as scaffolds. This study proposes a method for synthesizing metallic structures that resemble the 3D assemblies of specific proteins in mammalian cells and animal tissues. Using 1.4 nm nanogold-conjugated antibodies, specific proteins within cells and ex vivo tissues are labeled, and then the nanogold acts as nucleation sites for growth of metal particles. As proof of concept, various metal particles are grown using microtubules in cells as templates. The metal-containing cells are applied as catalysts and show catalytic stability in liquid-phase reactions due to the rigid support provided by the microtubules. Finally, this method is used to produce metal structures that replicate the specific protein assemblies of neurons in the mouse brain or the extracellular matrices in the mouse kidney and heart. This new biotemplating approach can facilitate the conversion of specific protein structures into metallic forms in ex vivo multicellular organisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Preparation of 2D Molybdenum Phosphide via Surface&#8208;Confined Atomic Substitution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonlayered molybdenum phosphide (MoP) with well&#8208;defined 2D morphology and tunable crystallinity can be prepared from layered molybdenum dichalcogenides via surface&#8208;confined atomic substitution. In contrast to the well&#8208;documented edge&#8208;dominated electrocatalytic performance of the MoS2 precusor, the entire basal plane of MoP demonstrates satisfying electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction performance owing to its coordination&#8208;unsaturated surface atoms with abundant dangling bonds.








Abstract
The emerging nonlayered 2D materials (NL2DMs) are sparking immense interest due to their fascinating physicochemical properties and enhanced performance in many applications. NL2DMs are particularly favored in catalytic applications owing to the extremely large surface area and low&#8208;coordinated surface atoms. However, the synthesis of NL2DMs is complex because their crystals are held together by strong isotropic covalent bonds. Here, nonlayered molybdenum phosphide (MoP) with well&#8208;defined 2D morphology is synthesized from layered molybdenum dichalcogenides via surface&#8208;confined atomic substitution. During the synthesis, the molybdenum dichalcogenide nanosheet&#160;functions as the host matrix where each layer of Mo maintains their hexagonal arrangement and forms isotropic covalent bonds with P that substitutes S, resulting in the conversion from layered van der Waals material to a covalently bonded NL2DM. The MoP nanosheets converted from few&#8208;layer MoS2 are single crystalline, while those converted from monolayers are amorphous. The converted MoP demonstrates metallic charge transport and desirable performance in the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). More importantly, in contrast to MoS2, which shows edge&#8208;dominated HER performance, the edge and basal plane of MoP deliver similar HER performance, which is correlated with theoretical calculations. This work provides a new synthetic strategy for high&#8208;quality nonlayered materials with well&#8208;defined 2D morphology for future exploration.

         <title>The Energy Level Conundrum of Organic Semiconductors in Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photovoltaic gap measured by ultraviolet and low&#8208;energy photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS/LE&#8208;IPES) gives the best correlation to device properties, enabling the prediction of maximum Voc. Cyclic voltammetry (CV)&#8208;derived redox potentials are less meaningful for predicting the energetic landscape at the &#8220;donor&#8221;&#8211;&#8220;acceptor&#8221; interface.








Abstract
The frontier molecular energy levels of organic semiconductors are decisive for their fundamental function and efficiency in optoelectronics. However, the precise determination of these energy levels and their variation when using different techniques makes it hard to compare and establish design rules. In this work, the energy levels of 33 organic semiconductors via cyclic voltammetry (CV), density functional theory, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, and low&#8208;energy inverse photoelectron spectroscopy are determined. Solar cells are fabricated to obtain key device parameters and relate them to the significant differences in the energy levels and offsets obtained from different methods. In contrast to CV, the photovoltaic gap measured using photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) correlates well with the experimental device VOC. It is demonstrated that high&#8208;performing systems such as PM6:Y6 and WF3F:Y6, which are previously reported to have negligible ionization energy (IE) offsets (&#916;IE), possess sizable &#916;IE of &#8776;0.5&#160;eV, determined by PES. Using various D&#8211;A blends, it is demonstrated that &#916;IE plays a key role in charge generation. In contrast to earlier reports, it is shown that a vanishing &#916;IE is detrimental to device performance. Overall, these findings establish a solid base for reliably evaluating material energetics and interpreting property&#8211;performance relationships in organic solar cells.

         <title>Emergent Magnetic Fan Structures in Manganite Homojunction Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese oxide homojunctions with gradually modulated doping level host surprisingly complex, long&#8208;range ordered magnetic superstructures whose spin alignment is tunable by low magnetic fields. Homojunctions can thus serve as a powerful design element of all&#8208;oxide spintronic devices.








Abstract
Devices with tunable magnetic noncollinearity are important components of superconducting electronics and spintronics, but they typically require epitaxial integration of several complex materials. The spin&#8208;polarized neutron reflectometry measurements on La1&#8722;xSrxMnO3 homojunction arrays with modulated Sr concentration reported herein have led to the discovery of magnetic fan structures with highly noncollinear alignment of Mn spins and an emergent periodicity twice as large as the array's unit cell. The neutron data show that these magnetic superstructures can be fully long&#8208;range ordered, despite the gradual modulation of the doping level created by charge transfer and chemical intermixing. The degree of noncollinearity can be effectively adjusted by low magnetic fields. Notwithstanding their chemical and structural simplicity, oxide homojunctions thus show considerable promise as a platform for tunable complex magnetism and as a powerful design element of spintronic&#160;devices.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystalline Perovskite p&#8211;n Junction Nanowire Arrays for Ultrasensitive Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A type of ultrasensitive photodetectors is demonstrated with single&#8208;crystalline perovskite p&#8211;n&#8208;junction nanowire arrays. The high crystallinity of the nanowire arrays enables efficient carrier transport and the formation of the built&#8208;in electric field in the p&#8211;n junction facilitates effective carrier separation. The photodetectors show excellent sensitivity over a wide spectral range from 405 to 635&#160;nm with outstanding responsivities.








Abstract
Highly sensitive photodetectors play significant roles in modern optoelectronic integrated circuits. Constructing p&#8211;n junctions has been proven to be a particularly powerful approach to realizing sensitive photodetection due to their efficient carrier separation. Recently, p&#8211;n&#8208;junction photodetectors based on organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites, which combine favorable optoelectronic performance with facile processability, hold great potential in practical applications. So far, these devices have generally been made of polycrystalline films, which exhibit poor carrier&#8208;transport efficiency, impeding the further improvement of their photoresponsivities. Here, a type of ultrasensitive photodetector based on single&#8208;crystalline perovskite p&#8211;n&#8208;junction nanowire arrays is demonstrated. The single&#8208;crystalline perovskite p&#8211;n&#8208;junction nanowire arrays not only possess high crystallinity that enables efficient carrier transport but also form a built&#8208;in electric field facilitating effective carrier separation. As a result, the devices show excellent photosensitivity over a wide spectral range from 405 to 635&#160;nm with an outstanding responsivity of 2.65&#160;&#215;&#160;102&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 at 532&#160;nm. These results will provide new insights into the design and construction of high&#8208;performance photodetectors for practical optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Exposing Single Ni Atoms in Hollow S/N&#8208;Doped Carbon Macroporous Fibers for Highly Efficient Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni single atoms embedded S/N&#8208;doped carbon macroporous fibers (Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;CMF) are fabricated through pyrolysis of rationally designed CdS&#8208;NiSx@PAN composite fibers. Benefiting from the abundant exposed single Ni atoms and hollow macroporous structure, the resultant Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;CMF electrocatalyst exhibits outstanding activity and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction.








Abstract
The development of efficient and cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is highly desirable for clean energy and fuel conversion. Herein, the facile preparation of Ni single atoms embedded hollow S/N&#8208;doped carbon macroporous fibers (Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;CMF) as efficient catalysts for OER through pyrolysis of designed CdS&#8208;NiSx/polyacrylonitrile composite fibers is reported. Specifically, CdS provides the sulfur source for the doping of polyacrylonitrile&#8208;derived carbon matrix and simultaneously creates the hollow macroporous structure, while NiSx is first reduced to nanoparticles and finally evolves into single Ni atoms through the atom migration&#8208;trapping strategy. Benefiting from the abundantly exposed single Ni atoms and hollow macroporous structure, the resultant Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;CMF electrocatalysts deliver outstanding activity and stability for OER. Specifically, it needs an overpotential of 285&#160;mV to achieve the benchmark current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a small Tafel slope of 50.8&#160;mV dec&#8722;1.

         <title>Experimental Realization of Atomic Monolayer Si9C15</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D Si9C15 monolayer is fabricated on Ru (0001) and Rh(111) substrates via the reaction between Si and graphene under high temperatures. The as&#8208;grown Si9C15 layer is micrometer&#8208;scale, high quality, and single crystalline with a bandgap of &#8776;1.9 eV. Combined measurements and density functional calculations confirm the buckled honeycomb structure. The novel 2D material also shows good air stability.








Abstract
Monolayer SixCy constitutes an important family of&#160;2D&#160;materials that is predicted to feature a honeycomb structure and appreciable bandgaps. However, due to its binary chemical nature and the lack of bulk polymorphs with a layered structure, the fabrication of such materials has so far been challenging. Here, the synthesis of atomic monolayer Si9C15 on Ru (0001) and Rh(111) substrates is reported. A combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations is used to infer that the 2D lattice of Si9C15 is a buckled honeycomb structure. Monolayer Si9C15 shows semiconducting behavior with a bandgap of &#8776;1.9&#160;eV. Remarkably, the Si9C15 lattice remains intact after exposure to ambient conditions, indicating good air stability. The present work expands the 2D&#8208;materials library and provides a promising platform for future studies in nanoelectronics and nanophotonics.

         <title>SrTiO3/CuNi&#8208;Heterostructure&#8208;Based Thermopile for Sensitive Human Radiation Detection and Noncontact Human&#8211;Machine Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
SrTiO3/CuNi heterostructure&#8208;based thermopile, characterized by the combination of high thermoelectric performance and near&#8208;unity long&#8208;wave infrared absorption, exhibits high sensitivity to human radiation. Further integration of human radiation into a noncontact human&#8211;machine interaction system is experimentally demonstrated, and the real&#8208;time recognition of hand gestures and touchless input of Arabic numbers and English letters are implemented.








Abstract
Noncontact interactive technology provides an intelligent solution to mitigate public health risks from cross&#8208;infection in the era of COVID&#8208;19. The utilization of human radiation as a stimulus source is conducive to the implementation of low&#8208;power, robust noncontact human&#8211;machine interaction. However, the low radiation intensity emitted by humans puts forward a high demand for photodetection performance. Here, a SrTiO3&#8722;x/CuNi&#8208;heterostructure&#8208;based thermopile is constructed, which features the combination of high thermoelectric performance and near&#8208;unity long&#8208;wave infrared absorption, to realize the self&#8208;powered detection of human radiation. The response level of this thermopile to human radiation is orders of magnitude higher than those of low&#8208;dimensional&#8208;materials&#8208;based photothermoelectric detectors and even commercial thermopiles. Furthermore, a touchless input device based on the thermopile array is developed, which can recognize hand gestures, numbers, and letters in real&#8208;time. This work offers a reliable strategy to integrate the spontaneous human radiation into noncontact human&#8211;machine interaction systems.

         <title>Percolated Plasmonic Superlattices of Nanospheres with 1 nm&#8208;Level Gap as High&#8208;Index Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heteroligand gold nanoparticles are stable in an oil phase but can be switched to stable Janus particles at the interface, which forms a 2D superlattice over square centimeters with nanometer&#8208;precision particle&#8208;to&#8208;particle gap. The percolated 2D superstructure exhibits the highest&#8208;ever refractive index (&#8776;7.8) on varying the size and interparticle gap of the NPs, which is explained by a new theoretical model based on &#8220;plasmonic percolation.&#8221;








Abstract
Nanophotonics relies on precise control of refractive index (RI) which can be designed with metamaterials. Plasmonic superstructures of nanoparticles (NPs) can suggest a versatile way of tuning RI. However, the plasmonic effects in the superstructures demand 1 nm&#8208;level exquisite control over the interparticle gap, which is challenging in a sub&#8208;wavelength NPs. Thus far, a large&#8208;area demonstration has been mostly discouraged. Here, heteroligand AuNPs are prepared, which are stable in oil but become Janus particles at the oil&#8211;water interface, called &#8220;adaptive Janus particles.&#8221; NPs are bound at the interface and assembled into 2D arrays over square centimeters as toluene evaporates, which distinctively exhibits the RI tunability. In visible and NIR light, the 2D superstructures exhibit the highest&#8208;ever RI (&#8776;7.8) with varying the size and interparticle gap of NPs, which is successfully explained by a plasmonic percolation model. Furthermore, fully solution&#8208;processable 2D plasmonic superstructures are proved to be advantageous in flexible photonic devices such as distributed Bragg reflectors.

         <title>Robust Piezoelectricity with Spontaneous Polarization in Monolayer Tellurene and Multilayer Tellurium Film at Room Temperature for Reliable Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust piezoelectricity with spontaneous polarization is detected in tellurene at room temperature due to the strong anisotropic property and dipoles induced by unique charity helical chain structure and strong intramolecular interactions. A charming memory window and high on switching current are realized in tellurene&#8208;based memory, providing a new platform to construct robust memory cells for neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Robust neuromorphic computing in the Big Data era calls for long&#8208;term stable crossbar&#8208;array memory cells; however, the elemental segregation in the switch unit and memory unit that inevitably occurs upon cycling breaks the compositional and structural stability, making the whole memory cell a failure. Searching for a novel material without segregation that can be used for both switch and memory units is the major concern to fabricate robust and reliable nonvolatile cross&#8208;array memory cells.

     alt="Robust Piezoelectricity with Spontaneous Polarization in Monolayer Tellurene and Multilayer Tellurium Film at Room Temperature for Reliable Memory"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robust piezoelectricity with spontaneous polarization is detected in tellurene at room temperature due to the strong anisotropic property and dipoles induced by unique charity helical chain structure and strong intramolecular interactions. A charming memory window and high on switching current are realized in tellurene-based memory, providing a new platform to construct robust memory cells for neuromorphic computing.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robust neuromorphic computing in the Big Data era calls for long-term stable crossbar-array memory cells; however, the elemental segregation in the switch unit and memory unit that inevitably occurs upon cycling breaks the compositional and structural stability, making the whole memory cell a failure. Searching for a novel material without segregation that can be used for both switch and memory units is the major concern to fabricate robust and reliable nonvolatile cross-array memory cells. Tellurium (Te) is found recently to be the only peculiar material without segregation for switching, but the memory function has not been demonstrated yet. Herein, apparent piezoelectricity is experimentally confirmed with spontaneous polarization behaviors in elementary 2D Te, even in monolayer tellurene (0.4&#160;nm), due to the highly oriented polarization of the molecular structure and the non-centrosymmetric lattice structure. A large memory window of 7000, a low working voltage of 2&#160;V, and high on switching current up to 36.6 &#181;A&#8201;&#181;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; are achieved in the as-fabricated Te-based memory device, revealing the great promise of Te for both switching and memory units in one cell without segregation. The piezoelectric Te with spontaneous polarization provides a platform to build robust, reliable, and high-density logic-in-memory chips in neuromorphic computing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rapid Ultratough Topological Tissue Adhesives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tissue adhesives capable of achieving tough adhesion in wet environments are useful in many biomedical applications. It is shown that combining pH&#8208;responsive bridging chitosan polymer chains and a tough hydrogel dissipative matrix can achieve ultratough adhesion to tissues (&gt;2000 J m&#8722;2) without covalent bond formation. These properties open opportunities for new strategies in the development of non&#8208;covalent tissue adhesives.








Abstract
Tissue adhesives capable of achieving strong and tough adhesion in permeable wet environments are useful in many biomedical applications. However, adhesion generated through covalent bond formation directly with the functional groups of tissues (i.e., &#63743;COOH and &#63743;NH2&#160;groups in collagen), or using non&#8208;covalent interactions can both be limited by weak, unstable, or slow adhesion. Here, it is shown that by combining pH&#8208;responsive bridging chitosan polymer chains and a tough hydrogel dissipative matrix one can achieve unprecedented ultratough adhesion to tissues (&gt;2000&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2) in 5&#8211;10&#160;min without covalent bond formation. The strong non&#8208;covalent adhesion is shown to be stable under physiologically relevant conditions and strongly influenced by chitosan molecular weight, molecular weight of polymers in the matrix, and pH. The adhesion mechanism relies primarily on the topological entanglement between the chitosan chains and the permeable adherends. To further expand the applicability of the adhesives, adhesion time can be decreased by dehydrating the hydrogel matrix to facilitate rapid chitosan interpenetration and entanglement (&gt;1000&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;in &#8804;1&#160;min). The unprecedented adhesive properties presented in this study open opportunities for new strategies in the development of non&#8208;covalent tissue adhesives and numerous bioapplications.

         <title>Convection Driven Ultrarapid Protein Detection via Nanobody&#8208;Functionalized Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing alternating current electrothermal flow (ACET) at the sample incubation step accelerates the operation of an organic&#8208;electrochemical&#8208;transistor&#8208;based protein sensor with a limit of detection at the attomolar range. The ACET integrated sensor exhibits a sample&#8208;to&#8208;result time of 2 min, with better selectivity, higher sensitivity, and lower limit of detection than the equivalent sensor with diffusion&#8208;dominated operation.








Abstract
Conventional biosensors rely on the diffusion&#8208;dominated transport of the target analyte to the sensor surface. Consequently, they require an incubation step that may take several hours to allow for the capture of analyte molecules by sensor biorecognition sites. This incubation step is a primary cause of long sample&#8208;to&#8208;result times. Here, alternating current electrothermal flow (ACET) is integrated in an organic electrochemical transistor (OECT)&#8208;based sensor to accelerate the device operation. ACET is applied to the gate electrode functionalized with nanobody&#8211;SpyCatcher fusion proteins. Using the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein in human saliva as an example target, it is shown that ACET enables protein recognition within only 2 min of sample exposure, supporting its use in clinical practice. The ACET integrated sensor exhibits better selectivity, higher sensitivity, and lower limit of detection than the equivalent sensor with diffusion&#8208;dominated operation. The performance of ACET integrated sensors is compared with two types of organic semiconductors in the channel and grounds for device&#8208;to&#8208;device variations are investigated. The results provide guidelines for the channel material choice in OECT&#8208;based biochemical sensors, and demonstrate that ACET integration substantially decreases the detection speed while increasing the sensitivity and selectivity of transistor&#8208;based sensors.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing and Light&#8208;Soaking in MAPbI3: The Effect of H2O</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two&#8208;photon&#8208;induced photodamage and consequent self&#8208;healing inside MAPbI3 single crystals are investigated. Two photobrightening and one photodarkening process are identified,&#160;which&#160;are connected to trap&#8208;filling, methylamine&#8208;chemistry, and the lead&#8208;halide sublattice. H2O is&#160;found&#160;to&#160;strongly influence the overall photodamage and kinetics of the self&#8208;healing process, showing an important connection between self&#8208;healing and the presence of H2O. 








Abstract
The future of halide perovskites (HaPs) is beclouded by limited understanding of their long&#8208;term stability. While HaPs can be altered by radiation that induces multiple processes, they can also return to their original state by &#8220;self&#8208;healing.&#8221; Here two&#8208;photon (2P) absorption is used to effect light&#8208;induced modifications within MAPbI3 single crystals. Then the changes in the photodamaged region are followed by measuring the photoluminescence, from 2P absorption with 2.5&#160;orders of magnitude lower intensity than that used for photodamaging the MAPbI3. After photodamage, two brightening and one darkening process are found, all of which recover but on different timescales. The first two are attributed to trap&#8208;filling (the fastest) and to proton&#8208;amine&#8208;related chemistry (the slowest), while photodamage is attributed to the lead&#8208;iodide sublattice. Surprisingly, while after 2P&#8208;irradiation of crystals that are stored in dry, inert ambient, photobrightening (or &#8220;light&#8208;soaking&#8221;) occurs, mostly photodarkening is seen after photodamage in humid ambient, showing an important connection between the self&#8208;healing of a HaP and the presence of H2O, for long&#8208;term steady&#8208;state illumination, practically no difference remains between samples kept in dry or humid environments. This result suggests that photobrightening requires a chemical&#8208;reservoir that is sensitive to the presence of H2O, or possibly other proton&#8208;related, particularly amine, chemistry.

         <title>Controlled Formation of Conduction Channels in Memristive Devices Observed by X&#8208;ray Multimodal Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
While neuromorphic computing provides a means for achieving faster and more energy efficient computations, the accuracy needs improvement by reducing the randomness of memristive behavior. The controlled formation of conduction channels is shown here, as observed by X&#8208;ray multimodal imaging of both oxygen stoichiometry and crystallinity. The results suggest an effective route for controlling the otherwise random electroforming process.








Abstract
Neuromorphic computing provides a means for achieving faster and more energy efficient computations than conventional digital computers for artificial intelligence (AI). However, its current accuracy is generally less than the dominant software&#8208;based AI. The key to improving accuracy is to reduce the intrinsic randomness of memristive devices, emulating synapses in the brain for neuromorphic computing. Here using a planar device as a model system, the controlled formation of conduction channels is achieved with high oxygen vacancy concentrations through the design of sharp protrusions in the electrode gap, as observed by X&#8208;ray multimodal imaging of both oxygen stoichiometry and crystallinity. Classical molecular dynamics simulations confirm that the controlled formation of conduction channels arises from confinement of the electric field, yielding a reproducible spatial distribution of oxygen vacancies across switching cycles. This work demonstrates an effective route to control the otherwise random electroforming process by electrode design, facilitating the development of more accurate memristive devices for neuromorphic computing.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuromorphic computing provides a means for achieving faster and more energy efficient computations than conventional digital computers for artificial intelligence (AI). However, its current accuracy is generally less than the dominant software-based AI. The key to improving accuracy is to reduce the intrinsic randomness of memristive devices, emulating synapses in the brain for neuromorphic computing. Here using a planar device as a model system, the controlled formation of conduction channels is achieved with high oxygen vacancy concentrations through the design of sharp protrusions in the electrode gap, as observed by X-ray multimodal imaging of both oxygen stoichiometry and crystallinity. Classical molecular dynamics simulations confirm that the controlled formation of conduction channels arises from confinement of the electric field, yielding a reproducible spatial distribution of oxygen vacancies across switching cycles. This work demonstrates an effective route to control the otherwise random electroforming process by electrode design, facilitating the development of more accurate memristive devices for neuromorphic computing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrafine Silver Nanoparticle Encapsulated Porous Molecular Traps for Discriminative Photoelectrochemical Detection of Mustard Gas Simulants by Synergistic Size&#8208;Exclusion and Site&#8208;Specific Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ photoreduction and subsequent encapsulation process affords nanocomposite materials comprising sub&#8208;1&#160;nm Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) encapsulated in hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs). Compared to traditional semiconductors and selected metal&#8211;organic framework materials, the AgNPs@HOFs exhibit significantly enhanced photocurrent. A portable photoelectrochemical (PEC) device based on AgNPs@HOF&#8208;101 detects chemical warfare agent (CWA) simulants with both nanomolar sensitivity and excellent selectivity.








Abstract
The rapid, discriminative, and portable detection of highly toxic chemical warfare agents is extremely important for response to public security emergencies but remains a challenge. One plausible solution involves the integration of porous molecular traps onto a photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensor. Here, a fast and facile protocol is developed to fabricate sub&#8208;1&#160;nm AgNPs encapsulated hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) nanocomposite materials through an in situ photoreduction and subsequent encapsulation process. Compared to traditional semiconductors and selected metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF) materials, these AgNPs@HOFs show significantly enhanced photocurrent. Most importantly, the portable PEC device based on AgNPs@HOF&#8208;101 can selectively recognize 13 different mustard gas simulants, including 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), based on synergistic size&#8208;exclusion and specific recognition. The extremely low detection limit for CEES (15.8&#160;nmol L&#8722;1), reusability (at least 30 cycles), and long&#8208;term working stability (at least 30 d) of the portable PEC device warrant its use as a chemical warfare agents (CWAs) sensor in practical field settings. More broadly, this work indicates that integrating porous molecular traps onto PEC sensors offers a promising strategy to further develop portable devices for CWAs detection with both ultrahigh sensitivity and selectivity.

         <title>A New Polymer Donor Enables Binary All&#8208;Polymer Organic Photovoltaic Cells with 18% Efficiency and Excellent Mechanical Robustness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By rational molecular design, a polymer donor named PQM&#8208;Cl is designed. Optimal power conversion efficiencies of 18.0% and 16.5% are achieved in rigid and flexible all&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaic cells, respectively. This work demonstrates that PQM&#8208;Cl is a promising polymer donor and the design of new polymer donors is essential for further improving the photovoltaic performance of all&#8208;polymer OPV cells.








Abstract
The development of polymerized small&#8208;molecule acceptors has boosted the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells to 17%. However, the polymer donors suitable for all&#8208;polymer OPV cells are still lacking, restricting the further improvement of their PCEs. Herein, a new polymer donor named PQM&#8208;Cl is designed and its photovoltaic performance is explored. The negative electrostatic potential and low average local ionization energy distribution of the PQM&#8208;Cl surface enable efficient charge generation and transfer process. When blending with a well&#8208;used polymer acceptor, PY&#8208;IT, the PQM&#8208;Cl&#8208;based devices deliver an impressive PCE of 18.0% with a superior fill factor of 80.7%, both of which are the highest values for all&#8208;polymer OPV cells. The relevant measurements demonstrate that PQM&#8208;Cl&#8208;based films possess excellent mechanical and flexible properties. As such, PQM&#8208;Cl&#8208;based flexible photovoltaic cells are fabricated and an excellent PCE of 16.5% with high mechanical stability is displayed. These results demonstrate that PQM&#8208;Cl is a potential candidate for all&#8208;polymer OPV cells and provide insights into the design of polymer donors for high&#8208;efficient all&#8208;polymer OPV cells.

Organic Semiconductors
In article number 2202575, Anirudh Sharma, Derya Baran, and co&#8208;workers unravel the inconsistencies of the determination of the absolute energy levels in organic semiconductors and their implication, particularly in the field of organic solar cells. In the cover image, the charges generated by the excitation of the materials by light are represented by the energy balls with feet and hands: electrons are represented in green and holes in red. The charges are jumping down a staircase, representing the energy levels of different organic semiconductor materials.

Bismuth Oxyselenide
Novel photoinduced quasiparticles, excimers, in the non&#8208;van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals 2D semiconductor Bi2O2Se are unambiguously by Jianbo Hu and co&#8208;workers in article number 2204227, identified through analyzing the emerging dynamic features by transient absorption spectra. Excimers in the Bi2O2Se nanosheets are diffusive and their formation can be simply described as excitons relaxed to an excimer geometry. This work advances the fundamental understanding of carrier dynamics in Bi2O2Se, which may motivate novel device design.

         <title>Toward Practical High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Pouch Cells: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cells are cpomprehensively reviewed regarding the key design parameters, the current performances, and recent advances on failure analysis and promotion strategies on cathode, electrolyte, and anode.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries promise great potential as high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy&#8208;storage devices due to their ultrahigh theoretical energy density of 2600&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1. Evaluation and analysis on practical Li&#8211;S pouch cells are essential for achieving actual high energy density under working conditions and affording developing directions for practical applications. This review aims to afford a comprehensive overview of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8211;S pouch cells regarding 7&#160;years of development and to point out further research directions. Key design parameters to achieve actual high energy density are addressed first, to define the research boundaries distinguished from coin&#8208;cell&#8208;level evaluation. Systematic analysis of the published literature and cutting&#8208;edge performances is then conducted to demonstrate the achieved progress and the gap toward practical applications. Following that, failure analysis as well as promotion strategies at the pouch cell level are, respectively, discussed to reveal the unique working and failure mechanism that shall be accordingly addressed. Finally, perspectives toward high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S pouch cells are presented regarding the challenges and opportunities of this field.

         <title>Reactive Oxygen Species Scavenging Nanomedicine for the Treatment of Ischemic Heart Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The current developments, achievements, challenges, and future directions of reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;scavenging nanomedicine for the treatment of ischemic heart disease (IHD), as well as their risk factors, are reviewed. The properties, generation, and physiological roles of ROS in the process of IHD development and progression are discussed.








Abstract
Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is the leading cause of disability and mortality worldwide. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to play key roles in the progression of diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, which are independent risk factors that lead to atherosclerosis and the development of IHD. Engineered biomaterial&#8208;based nanomedicines are under extensive investigation and exploration, serving as smart and multifunctional nanocarriers for synergistic therapeutic effect. Capitalizing on cell/molecule&#8208;targeting drug delivery, nanomedicines present enhanced specificity and safety with favorable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Herein, the roles of ROS in both IHD and its risk factors are discussed, highlighting cardiovascular medications that have antioxidant properties, and summarizing the advantages, properties, and recent achievements of nanomedicines that have ROS scavenging capacity for the treatment of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis, ischemia/reperfusion, and myocardial infarction. Finally, the current challenges of nanomedicines for ROS&#8208;scavenging treatment of IHD and possible future directions are discussed from a clinical perspective.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Phase Exfoliation of Nonlayered Non&#8208;Van&#8208;Der&#8208;Waals Crystals into Nanoplatelets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent research progress on the use of liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation beyond layered van der Waals (vdW) crystals is summarized. Questions remain unanswered on how these 3D strongly bonded nonlayered crystals exfoliate into nanoplatelets, and on the insight of the exfoliation mechanism. The answer to the questions helps in revealing the future direction of this newly grown sub&#8208;family of 2D&#8208;class of materials.








Abstract
For nearly 15 years, researchers have been using liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation (LPE) to produce 2D nanosheets from layered crystals. This has yielded multiple 2D materials in a solution&#8208;processable form whose utility has been demonstrated in multiple applications. It was&#160;believed that the exfoliation of such materials is enabled by the very large bonding anisotropy of layered materials where the strength of intralayer chemical bonds is very much larger than that of interlayer van der Waals bonds. However, over the last five years, a number of papers have raised questions about our&#160;understanding of exfoliation by describing the LPE of nonlayered materials. These results are extremely surprising because, as no van der Waals gap is present to provide an easily cleaved direction, the exfoliation of such compounds requires the breaking of only chemical bonds. Here the progress in this unexpected new research area is examined. The structure and properties of nanoplatelets produced by LPE of nonlayered materials are reviewed. A number of unexplained trends are found, not least the preponderance of isotropic materials that have been exfoliated to give high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanoplatelets. Finally, the applications potential of this new class of 2D materials are considered.
