         <title>Atomically Dispersed Fe Sites Regulated by Adjacent Single Co Atoms Anchored on N&#8208;P co&#8208;doped Carbon Structures for Highly Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>

Abstract
Manipulating the coordination environment and electron distribution for heterogeneous catalysts at the atomic level is an effective strategy to improve the electrocatalytic performance but remains challenging. Herein, atomically dispersed Fe and Co anchored on nitrogen, phosphorus co&#8208;doped carbon hollow nanorod structures (FeCo&#8208;NPC) are rationally designed and synthesized. The as&#8208;prepared FeCo&#8208;NPC catalyst exhibits significantly boosted electrocatalytic kinetics and greatly upshifted half&#8208;wave potential for the oxygen reduction reaction. Furthermore, when utilized as the cathode, the FeCo&#8208;NPC catalyst also displays excellent zinc&#8208;air battery performance. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the introduction of single Co atoms with Co&#8208;N/P coordination around isolated Fe atoms induces asymmetric electron distribution, resulting in the suitable adsorption/desorption ability for oxygen intermediates and the optimized reaction barrier, thereby improving the electrocatalytic activity.

         <title>Precision Covalent Organic Frameworks for Surface Nucleation Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanometer&#8208;thick amphiphobic coating using covalent organic frameworks is shown to suppress the nucleation of calcium carbonate and ice crystals through nanoconfinement. The fluorine&#8208;free coating features excellent transparency and resistance to high&#8208;speed jets of water and organic solvents.








Abstract
Unwanted accumulation of ice and lime scale crystals on surfaces is a long&#8208;standing challenge with major economic and sustainability implications. Passive inhibition of icing and scaling by liquid&#8208;repellent surfaces are often inadequate, susceptible to surface failure under harsh conditions, and unsuitable for long&#8208;term/real&#8208;life usages. Such surfaces often require a multiplicity of additional features such as optical transparency, robust impact resistance, and ability to prevent contamination from low surface energy liquids. Unfortunately, most promising advances have relied on using perfluoro compounds, which are bio&#8208;persistent and/or highly toxic. Here it is&#160;shown that organic, reticular mesoporous structures, covalent organic frameworks (COFs), may offer a solution. By exploiting simple and scalable synthesis of defect&#8208;free COFs and rational post&#8208;synthetic functionalization, nanocoatings with precision nanoporosity (morphology) are prepared that can inhibit nucleation at the molecular level without compromising the related contamination prevention and robustness. The results offer a simple strategy to exploit the nanoconfinement effect, which remarkably delays the nucleation of ice and scale formation on surfaces. Ice nucleation is suppressed down to &#8722;28&#160;&#176;C, scale formation is avoided for &gt;2&#160;weeks in supersaturated conditions, and jets of organic solvents impacting at Weber numbers &gt;105 are resisted with surfaces that also offer optical transparency (&gt;92%).

         <title>Interface Engineering for Highly Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have made dramatic improvements and interface engineering plays a crucial role. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the advancements in interface engineering, including the design of interfaces, the functionalities they offer, and their impact on device performance. Future challenges and potential research directions are outlined associated with interface engineering for large&#8208;area, high&#8208;performance, and cost&#8208;effective OSCs.








Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have made dramatic advancements during the past decades owing to the innovative material design and device structure optimization, with power conversion efficiencies surpassing 19% and 20% for single&#8208;junction and tandem devices, respectively. Interface engineering, by modifying interface properties between different layers for OSCs, has become a vital part to promote the device efficiency. It is essential to elucidate the intrinsic working mechanism of interface layers, as well as the related physical and chemical processes that manipulate device performance and long&#8208;term stability. In this article, the advances in interface engineering aimed to pursue high&#8208;performance OSCs are reviewed. The specific functions and corresponding design principles of interface layers are summarized first. Then, the anode interface layer, cathode interface layer in single&#8208;junction OSCs, and interconnecting layer of tandem devices are discussed in separate categories, and the interface engineering&#8208;related improvements on device efficiency and stability are analyzed. Finally, the challenges and prospects associated with application of interface engineering are discussed with the emphasis on large&#8208;area, high&#8208;performance, and low&#8208;cost device manufacturing.

         <title>Narrowband Organic Afterglow via Phosphorescence F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer for Multifunctional Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Narrowband organic afterglow materials are achieved via a phosphorescence F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer process by the combination of the long&#8208;lived phosphorescence donor and narrowband emission feature of the fluorescence acceptor. The resulting materials exhibit high color purity and multicolor narrowband afterglow, demonstrating potential in high&#8208;resolution afterglow displays and instant information identification.








Abstract
Achieving multicolor organic afterglow materials with narrowband emission and high color purity is important in various optoelectronic fields but remains a great challenge. Here, an efficient strategy is presented to obtain narrowband organic afterglow materials via F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from long&#8208;lived phosphorescence donors to narrowband fluorescence acceptors in a polyvinyl alcohol matrix. The resulting materials exhibit narrowband emission with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) as small as 23&#160;nm and the longest lifetime of 721.22&#160;ms. Meanwhile, by pairing the appropriate donors and acceptors, multicolor and high color purity afterglow ranging from green to red with the maximum photoluminescence quantum yield of 67.1% are achieved. Moreover, given their long luminescence lifetime, high color purity, and flexibility, the potential applications are demonstrated in high&#8208;resolution afterglow displays and dynamic and quick information identification in low&#8208;light conditions. This work provides a facile approach for developing multicolor and narrowband afterglow materials as well as expands the features of organic afterglow.

         <title>Biomimetic Spun Silk Ionotronic Fibers for Intelligent Discrimination of Motions and Tactile Stimuli</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by liquid crystal spinning of animal silks, the highly stretchable, tough, and resilient spun silk ionotronic fibers are prepared by dry spinning with nematic silk microfibril dope solution. They are further incorporated into core&#8211;shell triboelectric nanogenerator fibers to sort and recognize objects made of different materials.








Abstract
Innovation in the ionotronics field has significantly accelerated the development of ultraflexible devices and machines. However, it is still challenging to develop efficient ionotronic&#8208;based fibers with necessary stretchability, resilience, and conductivity due to inherent conflict in producing spinning dopes with both high polymer and ion concentrations and low viscosities. Inspired by the liquid crystalline spinning of animal silk, this study circumvents the inherent tradeoff in other spinning methods by dry spinning a nematic silk microfibril dope solution. The liquid crystalline texture allows the spinning dope to flow through the spinneret and form free&#8208;standing fibers under minimal external forces. The resultant silk&#8208;sourced ionotronic fibers (SSIFs) are highly stretchable, tough, resilient, and fatigue&#8208;resistant. These mechanical advantages ensure a rapid and recoverable electromechanical response of SSIFs to kinematic deformations. Further, the incorporation of SSIFs into core&#8211;shell triboelectric nanogenerator fibers provides outstanding stable and sensitive triboelectric response to precisely and sensitively perceive small pressures. Moreover, by implementing a combination of machine learning and Internet of Things techniques, the SSIFs can sort objects made of different materials. With these structural, processing, performance, and functional merits, the SSIFs prepared herein are expected to be applied in human&#8211;machine interfaces.

         <title>Meta&#8208;Aerogel Ion Motor for Nanofluid Osmotic Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic meta&#8208;aerogel ion motors with actuatable &#8220;ion&#8208;express highways&#8221; are fabricated for blue energy harvesting. The nanofluidic meta&#8208;aerogels exhibit space&#8208;confined selective ion transport at the sub&#8208;nanometer level, which can produce an excellent output power density of over 30&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2 on mixing the natural seawater and river water, and power the devices including the ship model and home&#8208;made maritime safety warning system.








Abstract
Osmotic power, also known as &#8220;blue energy&#8221;, is a vast, sustainable, and clean energy source that can be directly converted into electricity by nanofluidic membranes. However, the key technological bottleneck for large&#8208;scale osmotic electricity is that macroscopic&#8208;scale bulky membrane cannot synergistically satisfy the demands of high power density and low resistance without sacrificing scalability and mechanical robustness. Here, inspired by the anatomy and working principle of electric eels, which harness osmotic energy through embedded neuron&#8208;mediated fibril nanochannels with nanoconfined transport dynamics. Fibrous nanofluidic meta&#8208;aerogel ion motors, 3D&#8208;assembled from nanofluidic cable fibers with actuatable stimulation/transport &#8220;ion highways&#8221; are engineered. The meta&#8208;aerogel exhibits the integrated coupling effect of boosted ion propulsion and surface&#8208;charge&#8208;dominated selective ion transport. Driven by osmosis, the meta&#8208;aerogel ion motor can produce an unprecedented output power density of up to 30.7&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2 under a 50&#8208;fold salinity gradient. Advancing ultra&#8208;selective ion transport in nanofluidic meta&#8208;aerogels may provide a promising roadmap for blue energy harvesting.

         <title>In situ Electropolymerized 3D Microporous Cobalt&#8208;Porphyrin Nanofilm for Highly Effective Molecular Electrocatalytic Reduction of Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D microporous polymer nanofilms of cobalt(II)&#8208;porphyrin are directly and uniformly deposited on the cathode via thickness&#8208;controlled, green, and catalyst&#8208;free electropolymerization. The films exhibit high activity and durability in electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion mainly due to tightly adhered abundant active sites. This work provides an effective way to fabricate molecular catalysts on electrodes for efficient electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) based on molecular catalysts, for example, cobalt porphyrin, is promising to enhance the carbon cycle and mitigate current climate crisis. However, the electrocatalytic performance and accurate evaluations remain problems because of either the low loading amount or the low utilization rate of the electroactive CoN4 sites. Herein a monomer is synthesized, cobalt(II)&#8208;5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(3,5&#8208;di(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenyl)porphyrin (CoP), electropolymerized onto carbon nanotubes (CNTs) networks, affording a molecular electrocatalyst of 3D microporous nanofilm (EP&#8208;CoP, 2&#8211;3&#160;nm thickness) with highly dispersed CoN4 sites. The new electrocatalyst shortens the electron transfer pathway, accelerates the redox kinetics of CoN4 sites, and improves the durability of the electrocatalytic CO2RR. From the intrinsic redox behavior of CoN4 sites, the effective utilization rate is obtained as 13.1%, much higher than that of the monomer assembled electrode (5.8%), and the durability is also promoted dramatically (&gt;40&#160;h) in H&#8208;type cells. In commercial flow cells, EP&#8208;CoP can achieve a faradic efficiency for CO (FECO) over 92% at an overpotential of 160&#160;mV. At a higher overpotential of 620&#160;mV, the working current density can reach 310&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with a high FECO of 98.6%, representing the best performance for electrodeposited molecular porphyrin electrocatalysts.

         <title>Induction of Metabolic Reprogramming in Kidney by Singlet Diradical Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocompatible nanoparticles are assembled from a diphenyl&#8208;substituted biolympicenylidene compound with a singlet diradical ground state. It is found that such nanoparticles can induce metabolic reprogramming in kidney organoids by promoting fatty acid degradation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation under redox homeostasis with an increased level of glutathione.








Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic compounds with an open&#8208;shell singlet diradical ground state, namely singlet diradicals, have recently gained attention in the fields of organic electronics, photovoltaics, and spintronics owing to their unique electronic structures and properties. Notably, singlet diradicals exhibit tunable redox amphoterism, which makes them excellent redox&#8208;active materials for biomedical applications. However, the safety and therapeutic efficacy of singlet diradicals in biological systems have not yet been explored. Herein, the study presents a newly designed singlet diradical nanomaterial, diphenyl&#8208;substituted biolympicenylidene (BO&#8208;Ph), exhibiting low cytotoxicity in vitro, non&#8208;significant acute nephrotoxicity in vivo, and the ability to induce metabolic reprogramming in kidney organoids. Integrated transcriptome and metabolome analyses reveal that the metabolism of BO&#8208;Ph stimulates glutathione (GSH) synthesis and fatty acid degradation, increases the levels of intermediates in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) and carnitine cycles, and eventually boosts oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) under redox homeostasis. Benefits of BO&#8208;Ph&#8208;induce metabolic reprogramming in kidney organoids include enhancing cellular antioxidant capacity and promoting mitochondrial function. The results of this study can facilitate the application of singlet diradical materials in the treatment of clinical conditions induced by mitochondrial abnormalities in kidney.

         <title>Recent Progress in Colloidal Quantum Dot Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solution&#8208;processable semiconducting quantum dots possess numerous fascinating properties sought for emerging thin&#8208;film thermoelectrics. Herein, key recent developments in colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) for thin&#8208;film thermoelectrics are discussed. The challenges and opportunities in developing efficient CQD&#8208;based thin&#8208;film thermoelectric generators operating near room temperature are highlighted.








Abstract
Semiconducting colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) represent an emerging class of thermoelectric materials for use in a wide range of future applications. CQDs combine solution processability at low temperatures with the potential for upscalable manufacturing via printing techniques. Moreover, due to their low dimensionality, CQDs exhibit quantum confinement and a high density of grain boundaries, which can be independently exploited to tune the Seebeck coefficient and thermal conductivity, respectively. This unique combination of attractive attributes makes CQDs very promising for application in emerging thermoelectric generator (TEG) technologies operating near room temperature. Herein, recent progress in CQDs for application in emerging thin&#8208;film thermoelectrics is reviewed. First,&#160;the fundamental concepts of thermoelectricity in nanostructured materials are outlined, followed by an overview of the popular synthetic methods used to produce CQDs with controllable sizes and shapes. Recent strides in CQD&#8208;based thermoelectrics are then discussed with emphasis on their application in thin&#8208;film TEGs. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives for further enhancing the performance of CQD&#8208;based thermoelectric materials for future applications are discussed.

         <title>A Deformable Additive on Defects Passivation and Phase Segregation Inhibition Enables the Efficiency of Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells over 24%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deformable coumarin has been successfully employed to passivate anion/cation defects and release residual stress, endowing that phase segregation can be effectively inhibited. Moreover, the benefit of the larger grain size and less trap&#8208;assisted recombination, yielding an exceptional efficiency of over 24% for rigid inverted perovskite solar cells and an efficiency of over 23% for flexible inverted perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
The defects and phase segregation in perovskite will significantly reduce the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, a deformable coumarin is employed as a multifunctional additive for formamidinium&#8211;cesium (FA&#8208;Cs) perovskite. During the annealing process of perovskite, the partial decomposition of coumarin passivates the Pb2+, iodine, and organic cation defects. Additionally, coumarin can affect colloidal size distributions, resulting in relatively large grain size and good crystallinity of target perovskite film. Hence, the carrier extraction/transport can be promoted, trap&#8208;assisted recombination is reduced, and energy levels are optimized in target perovskite films. Furthermore, the coumarin treatment can significantly release residual stress. As a result, the champion power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 23.18% and 24.14% are obtained for Br&#8208;rich (FA0.88Cs0.12PbI2.64Br0.36) and Br&#8208;poor (FA0.96Cs0.04PbI2.8Br0.12) based devices, respectively. The flexible PSCs based on Br&#8208;poor perovskite exhibit an excellent PCE of 23.13%, one of the highest values for flexible PSCs reported to date. Due to the inhibition of phase segregation, the target devices exhibit excellent thermal and light stability. This work provides new insights into the additive engineering of passivating defects, stress relief, and inhibition of phase segregation of perovskite films, offering a reliable method to develop state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art solar cells.

During the annealing process of perovskite, the partial decomposition of coumarin passivates the Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, iodine, and organic cation defects. Additionally, coumarin can affect colloidal size distributions, resulting in relatively large grain size and good crystallinity of target perovskite film. Hence, the carrier extraction/transport can be promoted, trap-assisted recombination is reduced, and energy levels are optimized in target perovskite films. Furthermore, the coumarin treatment can significantly release residual stress. As a result, the champion power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 23.18% and 24.14% are obtained for Br-rich (FA&lt;sub&gt;0.88&lt;/sub&gt;Cs&lt;sub&gt;0.12&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;2.64&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;0.36&lt;/sub&gt;) and Br-poor (FA&lt;sub&gt;0.96&lt;/sub&gt;Cs&lt;sub&gt;0.04&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;2.8&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;0.12&lt;/sub&gt;) based devices, respectively. The flexible PSCs based on Br-poor perovskite exhibit an excellent PCE of 23.13%, one of the highest values for flexible PSCs reported to date. Due to the inhibition of phase segregation, the target devices exhibit excellent thermal and light stability. This work provides new insights into the additive engineering of passivating defects, stress relief, and inhibition of phase segregation of perovskite films, offering a reliable method to develop state-of-the-art solar cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Calcitic Prisms of The Giant Seashell Pinna Nobilis Form Light Guide Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The calcitic prisms in Pinna nobilis shells act as optical fiber arrays guiding ambient light with high resolution into the inner shell cavity by total internal reflection. This is attributed to the high refractive index of calcite along the optical axis of the prisms and the coverage of their interfaces by low refractive index organic sheaths.








Abstract
The shells of the Pinnidae family are based on a double layer of single&#8208;crystal&#8208;like calcitic prisms and inner aragonitic nacre, a structure known for its outstanding mechanical performance. However, on the posterior side, shells are missing the nacreous layer, which raises the question of whether there can&#160;be any functional role in giving up this mechanical performance. Here, it is&#160;demonstrated that the prismatic part of the Pinna nobilis shell exhibits unusual optical properties, whereby each prism acts as an individual optical fiber guiding the ambient light to the inner shell cavity by total internal reflection. This pixelated light channeling enhances both spatial resolution and contrast while reducing angular blurring, an apt combination for acute tracking of a moving object. These&#160;findings offer insights into the evolutionary aspects of light&#8208;sensing and imaging and demonstrate how an architectured optical system for efficient light&#8208;tracking can be based on birefringent ceramics.

         <title>Cancer Stem&#8208;Like Cells&#8208;Oriented Surface Self&#8208;Assembly to&#160;Conquer Radioresistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An MMP&#8208;2 responsive peptide&#8208;based radiosensitizer is proposed to achieve deep tumor penetration and in situ self&#8208;assemble into functional nanofibers on the surface of hypoxic cancer stem&#8208;like cells (CSCs), which finally induces the hypoxic CSC differentiation and boosts the radiotherapeutic efficiency. This strategy provides a general nanoplatform to conquer CSCs&#8208;mediated radioresistance.








Abstract
Cancer stem&#8208;like cells (CSCs), capable of indefinite self&#8208;renewal and differentiation, are considered to be the root cause of tumor radiotherapy (RT) resistance. However, the CSCs&#8208;targeted therapy still remains to be a great challenge because they are commonly located in the deep tumor making drugs hard to approach, and their hypoxic and acidic niche can further aggravate radioresistance. Herein, based on the finding that hypoxic CSCs highly express carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) on the cell membrane, a CAIX&#8208;targeted induced in situ self&#8208;assembly system on the surface of CSC is reported to overcome hypoxic CSC&#8208;mediated radioresistance. Via the sequential processes of &#8220;monomer release&#8208;target accumulation&#8208;surface self&#8208;assembly&#8221;, the constructed peptide&#8208;based drug delivery system (CA&#8208;Pt) exhibits the advantages of deep penetration, amplified CAIX inhibition, and enhanced cellular uptake, which greatly relieves the hypoxic and acidic microenvironment to promote the hypoxic CSC differentiation and combines with platinum to boost the RT&#8208;inducing DNA damage. In both lung cancer tumor mouse and zebrafish embryo models, CA&#8208;Pt treatment can effectively assist RT in suppressing tumor growth and preventing tumor invasion and metastasis. This study uses a surface&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly strategy to differentiate hypoxic CSCs, which may provide a universal treatment strategy for overcoming tumor radioresistance.

         <title>The Challenge of Water Competition in Physical Adsorption of CO2 by Porous Solids for Carbon Capture Applications &#8211; A Short Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water is intrinsic to post&#8208;combustion flue streams. Its impact on chemisorptive carbon capture is well established. For physisorptive carbon capture, water is largely regarded as a nearly insurmountable hurdle for competitive carbon dioxide sorption. This perspective discusses, from chemical and engineering vantages, not just the opportunities to physisorb CO2 in wet gas but even suppress the sorption of water.








Abstract
With ever&#8208;increasing efforts to design sorbent materials to capture carbon dioxide from flue gas and air, this perspective article is provided based on nearly a decade of collaboration across science, engineering, and industry partners. A key point learned is that a holistic view of the carbon capture problem is critical. While researchers can be inclined to value their own fields and associated metrics, often, key parameters are those that enable synergy between materials and processes. While the role of water in the chemisorption of CO2 is well&#8208;studied, in this perspective, it is hoped to highlight the often&#8208;overlooked but critical role of water in assessing the potential of a physical adsorbent for CO2 capture. This is a challenge that requires interdisciplinarity. As such, this document is written for a general audience rather than experts in any specific discipline.

         <title>Molecular Structure and Conformational Design of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Conjugated Polymers to Enable Predictable Optoelectronic Property</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing integrated experimental and computational methods, it is demonstrated that alterations in the chain conformation of donor&#8208;acceptor conjugated polymers do not consistently exhibit a direct correlation with shifts in optical absorption. Moreover, it is revealed that the combined effect of chain conformation and the alignment of molecular orbital energy between donor and acceptor units influence the ultimate optical bandgap of donor&#8208;acceptor conjugated polymers.








Abstract
Tuning the optoelectronic properties of donor&#8208;acceptor conjugated polymers (D&#8208;A CPs) is of great importance in designing various organic optoelectronic devices. However, there remains a critical challenge in precise control of bandgap through synthetic approach, since the chain conformation also affects molecular orbital energy levels. Here, D&#8208;A CPs with different acceptor units are explored that show an opposite trend in energy band gaps with the increasing length of oligothiophene donor units. By investigating their chain conformation and molecular orbital energy, it is found that the molecular orbital energy alignment between donor and acceptor units plays a crucial role in dictating the final optical bandgap of D&#8208;A CPs. For polymers with staggered orbital energy alignment, the higher HOMO with increasing oligothiophene length leads to a narrowing of the optical bandgap despite decreased chain rigidity. On the other hand, for polymers with sandwiched orbital energy alignment, the increased band gap with increasing oligothiophene length originates from the reduction of bandwidth due to more localized charge density distribution. Thus, this work provides a molecular understanding of the role of backbone building blocks on the chain conformation and bandgaps of D&#8208;A CPs for organic optoelectronic devices through the conformation design and segment orbital energy alignment.

         <title>Catalyst Development for High&#8208;Temperature Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell (HT&#8208;PEMFC) Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review outlines catalyst advancements for high&#8208;temperature polymer electrolyte fuel
cells operating at elevated temperatures (160&#8208;180 &#176;C). These cells utilize reformate/air gasses and employ phosphoric acid within the polybenzimidazole polymer matrix as a proton&#8208;conducting medium. Catalysts employed are platinum or platinum&#8208;alloyed nanoparticles immobilized on a carbon support.








Abstract
A constant increase in global emission standard is causing fuel cell (FC) technology to gain importance. Over the last two decades, a great deal of research has been focused on developing more active catalysts to boost the performance of high&#8208;temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (HT&#8208;PEMFC), as well as their durability. Due to material degradation at high&#8208;temperature conditions, catalyst design becomes challenging. Two main approaches are suggested: (i) alloying platinum (Pt) with low&#8208;cost transition metals to reduce Pt usage, and (ii) developing novel catalyst support that anchor metal particles more efficiently while inhibiting corrosion phenomena. In this comprehensive review, the most recent platinum group metal (PGM) and platinum group metal free (PGM&#8208;free) catalyst development is detailed, as well as the development of alternative carbon (C) supports for HT&#8208;PEMFCs.

In this comprehensive review, the most recent platinum group metal (PGM) and platinum group metal free (PGM-free) catalyst development is detailed, as well as the development of alternative carbon (C) supports for HT-PEMFCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Homogeneous Phase Distribution in Q&#8208;2D Perovskites via Co&#8208;Assembly of Spacer Cations for Efficient Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spacer cations are tailored by adjusting the chain length and steric hindrance, which is proved to systematically affect the assembling of low&#8208;n phase perovskite via in situ absorption measurement. Homogeneous phase distribution is achieved through incorporating TPMA+, which restricts the stacking of PEA+ and eliminates the nucleation of the low&#8208;n phase, achieving the highest EQE of 23.9% for green PeLED.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D (Q&#8208;2D) perovskites are promising candidates to apply in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). However, delicate control on crystallization kinetics is needed to suppress severe phase segregation. Here, the crystallization kinetics of Q&#8208;2D perovskites are investigated via in situ absorbance spectroscopy and for the first time find the multiphase distribution is governed by the arrangement, rather than diffusion, of spacer cations at the nucleation stage, which associate with its assembling ability determined by molecular configuration. A &#8220;co&#8208;assembly&#8221; strategy is conceived by combining co&#8208;cations with different configuration characteristics, where bulky cations disturb the assembling between slender cations and lead&#8211;bromide sheet, contributing to homogeneous emitting phase with effective passivation. Correspondingly, in the phenylethylammonium (PEA+)&#8208;based Q&#8208;2D perovskites (&lt;n&gt;&#160;=&#160;3), homogeneous phase distribution is achieved by incorporating co&#8208;cation triphenylmethaneammonium (TPMA+), the branching terminals of which suppress cations assembling into low&#8208;n phases and afford adequate cations as passivating ligands. Therefore, the champion external quantum efficiency of the LED device reaches 23.9%, which is among the highest performance of green Q&#8208;2D perovskite LEDs. This work reveals that the arrangement of spacer cations determines the crystallization kinetics in Q&#8208;2D perovskites, providing further guidance on the molecular design and phase modulation of Q&#8208;2D perovskites.

         <title>Mn&#8208;Oxygen Compounds Coordinated Ruthenium Sites with Deprotonated and Low Oxophilic Microenvironments for Membrane Electrolyzer&#8208;based H2&#8208;Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn&#8208;oxygen compounds coordinated ruthenium sites (MOC&#8208;Ru) with deprotonated and low oxophilic microenvironments are created for modulating the adsorption&#8211;desorption of H* and OH*. Benefiting from the unique advantages of MOC, the MOC&#8208;Ru exhibits extremely low overpotential and ultralong stability in both acidic and alkaline hydrogen evolution. The MOC&#8208;Ru catalyst&#8208;equipped membrane electrolyzer displays outstanding activity and stability for continuous H2&#8208;production.








Abstract
Among the platinum&#8208;group metals, ruthenium (Ru), with a low water dissociation energy, is considered a promising alternative to substitute Pt for catalyzing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, optimizing the adsorption&#8211;desorption energies of H* and OH* intermediates on Ru catalytic sites is extremely desirable but remains challenging. Inspired by the natural catalytic characteristics of Mn&#8208;oxygen complex, this study reports to design Mn&#8208;oxygen compounds coordinated Ru sites (MOC&#8208;Ru) with deprotonated and low oxophilic microenvironments for modulating the adsorption&#8211;desorption of H* and OH* to promote HER kinetics. Benefiting from the unique advantages of MOC structures, including weakened H&#63743;OH bond at interface, electron donation ability, and deprotonation capability, the MOC&#8208;Ru exhibits extremely low overpotential and ultralong stability in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. Experimental observations and theoretical calculations elucidate that the MOC can accelerate water dissociation kinetics and promote OH* desorption in alkaline conditions and trigger the long&#8208;range H* spillover for H2&#8208;release in acid conditions. The outstanding activity and stability of membrane electrolyzer display that the MOC&#8208;Ru catalyst holds great potential as cathode for H2&#8208;production. This study provides essential insights into the crucial roles of deprotonated and low oxophilic microenvironments in HER catalysis and offers a new pathway to create an efficient water&#8208;splitting cathode.

         <title>Target Therapy for Buried Interface Enables Stable Perovskite Solar Cells with 25.05% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and effective strategy, i.e., target therapy of buried interface via incorporating formamidine oxalate in colloidal SnO2, is developed. Both formamidinium and oxalate ions show longitudinal gradient distribution with the highest concentration on the SnO2 film surface after annealing, which enables matched energy levels, high&#8208;quality upper perovskite films, and minimized defects. The perovskite solar cells deliver a high efficiency of 25.05% with enhanced device stability.








Abstract
The buried interface in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is pivotal for achieving high efficiency and stability. However, it is challenging to study and optimize the buried interface due to its non&#8208;exposed feature. Here, a facile and effective strategy is developed to modify the SnO2/perovskite buried interface by passivating the buried defects in perovskite and modulating carrier dynamics via incorporating formamidine oxalate (FOA) in SnO2 nanoparticles. Both formamidinium and oxalate ions show a longitudinal gradient distribution in the SnO2 layer, mainly accumulating at the SnO2/perovskite buried interface, which enables high&#8208;quality upper perovskite films, minimized defects, superior interface contacts, and matched energy levels between perovskite and SnO2. Significantly, FOA can simultaneously reduce the oxygen vacancies and tin interstitial defects on the SnO2 surface and the FA+/Pb2+ associated defects at the perovskite buried interface. Consequently, the FOA treatment significantly improves the efficiency of the PSCs from 22.40% to 25.05% and their storage&#8208; and photo&#8208;stability. This method provides an effective target therapy of buried interface in PSCs to achieve very high efficiency and stability.

         <title>Enhancing Efficiency of Low&#8208;Grade Heat Harvesting by Structural Vibration Entropy in Thermally Regenerative Electrochemical Cycles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle (TREC) is a promising energy harvesting system converting low&#8208;grade heat to usable electrochemical energy. In this work, the structural water molecules' influence is confirmed on the bond covalency. As a result, the small amount of water molecules induces strong A1g vibration which can enhance structural vibration, improving the performance of the TREC system.








Abstract
The majority of waste&#8208;heat energy exists in the form of low&#8208;grade heat (&lt;100&#160;&#176;C), which is immensely difficult to convert into usable energy using conventional energy&#8208;harvesting systems. Thermally regenerative electrochemical cycles (TREC), which integrate battery and thermal&#8208;energy&#8208;harvesting functionalities, are considered an attractive system for low&#8208;grade heat harvesting. Herein, the role of structural vibration modes in enhancing the efficacy of TREC systems is investigated. How changes in bonding covalency, influenced by the number of structural water molecules, impact the vibration modes is analyzed. It is discovered that even small amounts of water molecules can induce the A1g stretching mode of cyanide ligands with strong structural vibration energy, which significantly contributes to a larger temperature coefficient (&#593;) in a TREC system. Leveraging these insights, a highly efficient TREC system using a sodium&#8208;ion&#8208;based aqueous electrolyte is designed and implemented. This study provides valuable insights into the potential of TREC systems, offering a deeper understanding of the intrinsic properties of Prussian Blue analogs regulated by structural vibration modes. These insights open up new possibilities for enhancing the energy&#8208;harvesting capabilities of TREC systems.

         <title>Enhancing The Uniformity of Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors by a Single&#8208;Crystalline Layer&#8208;Controlled Active Channel</title>

Abstract
Despite that remarkable improvement on the mobility of the organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) has been achieved during the past decades, the uniformity in electrical performance remained ambiguous, impeding their implantation in organic integrated circuits. The coefficient of variance (CV) in mobility of reported OFETs were typically larger than 8%, which was not adequate for building medium&#8208;to&#8208;large scale integrated circuits. In this work, we showed that utilizing single&#8208;domain molecular monolayer crystals as the active channel can largely enhance the uniformity of OFETs. Benefiting from the sole molecular layer with long&#8208;range ordering, the OFETs exhibited uniformities in both channel transport and charge injection, thereby giving rise to a high average mobility of 11.64 cm2V&#8722;1s&#8722;1 and CV of only 2.57%. Statistical transmission length method evaluation was conducted, covering channel length from 3 to 21&#160;&#956;m, channel width from 90 to 170&#160;&#956;m, and a total OFET number of 370. The low contact resistance of 79.00 &#177; 7.00 &#937;&#183;cm and high intrinsic mobility of 12.36 &#177; 0.45 cm2V&#8722;1s&#8722;1 were acquired with very high accuracy and reliability. As such, this work provides a practical way to enhance the uniformity of OFETs by a single&#8208;crystalline layer&#8208;controlled active channel, towards their applications in integrated circuits.

         <title>Polymer Mechanochemistry in Microbubbles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polymer mechanochemistry is a promising technology to convert mechanical energy into chemical functionality by breaking covalent and supramolecular bonds site&#8208;selectively. Yet, the mechanochemical reaction rates of covalent bonds in typically used ultrasonication setups lead to reasonable conversions only after comparably long sonication times. This can be accelerated by either increasing the reactivity of the mechanoresponsive moiety or by modifying the encompassing polymer topology. Here, a microbubble system with a tailored polymer shell consisting of an N2 gas core and a mechanoresponsive disulfide&#8208;containing polymer network is presented. It is found that the mechanochemical activation of the disulfides is greatly accelerated using these microbubbles compared to commensurate solid core particles or capsules filled with liquid. Aided by computational simulations, it is found that low shell thickness, low shell stiffness and crosslink density, and a size&#8208;dependent eigenfrequency close to the used ultrasound frequency maximize the mechanochemical yield over the course of the sonication process.

         <title>Inhabiting Inactive Transition by Coupling Function of Oxygen Vacancies and Fe&#8208;C Bonds Achieving Long Cycle Life of Iron&#8208;Based Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fe&#8208;based battery&#8208;type anode materials with many faradaic reaction sites have higher capacities than carbon&#8208;based double&#8208;layer&#8208;type materials and can be used to develop aqueous supercapacitors with high energy density. However, as an insurmountable bottleneck, the severe capacity fading and poor cyclability derived from the inactive transition hinder their commercial application in asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs). Herein, driven by the &#8220;oxygen pumping&#8221; mechanism, oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich Fe@Fe3O4(v)@Fe3C@C nanoparticles are developed that consist of a unique &#8220;fruit with stone&#8221;&#8208;like structure and exhibit enhanced specific capacity and fast charge/discharge capability. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the capacity attenuation in conventional iron&#8208;based anodes is greatly alleviated in the Fe@Fe3O4(v)@Fe3C@C anode because the irreversible phase transition to the inactive &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 phase could be inhibited by a robust barrier formed by the coupling of oxygen vacancies and Fe&#8208;C bonds, which promotes cycle stability (93.5% capacity retention after 24,000 cycles). ASC fabricated using this Fe&#8208;based anode is also observed to have extraordinary durability, achieving capacity retention of 96.4% after 38,000 cycles, and a high energy density of 127.6 W h kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 981 W kg&#8722;1.

         <title>Buried&#8208;Interface Engineering of Conformal 2d/3d Perovskite Heterojunction for Efficient Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells on Industrially Textured Silicon</title>

Abstract
Exploring strategies to control the crystallization and modulate interfacial properties for high&#8208;quality perovskite film on industry&#8208;relevant textured crystalline silicon solar cells is highly valued in the perovskite/silicon tandem photovoltaics community. The formation of a two&#8208;dimensional/three&#8208;dimensional (2D/3D) perovskite heterojunction has been widely employed to passivate defects and suppress ion migration in the film surface of perovskite solar cells. However, realizing solution&#8208;processed heterostructures at the buried interface face solvent incompatibilities with the challenge of underlying&#8208;layer disruption and texture incompatibilities with the challenge of uneven coverage. Here, we use a hybrid two&#8208;step deposition method to prepare robust 2D perovskites with cross&#8208;linkable ligands underneath the 3D perovskite. This structurally coherent interlayer benefits the preferred crystal growth of strain&#8208;free and uniform upper perovskite, inhibits interfacial defect&#8208;induced instability and recombination, and promotes charge&#8208;carrier extraction with ideal energy&#8208;level alignment. We demonstrate the broad applicability of the bottom&#8208;contact heterostructure for different textured substrates with conformal coverage and various precursor solutions with intact properties free of erosion. With this buried interface engineering strategy, the resulting perovskite/silicon tandem cells based on industrially textured Czochralski (CZ) silicon achieve a certified efficiency of 28.4% (1.0 cm2), while retaining 89% of the initial PCE after over 1,000&#8208;hour operation.

         <title>Spider Silk&#8208;Inspired Binder Design for Flexible Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery with High Durability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The development of flexible lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) imposes demands on energy density and high mechanical durability simultaneously. Due to the limited deformability of electrodes, as well as the flat and smooth surface of the metal current collectors, stable/durable/reliable contact between electrode materials and the current collectors remains a challenge, in particular, for electrodes with high loading mass and heavily deformed batteries. Binders play an essential role in binding particles of electrode materials and adhering them to current collectors. Herein, inspired by spider silk, a binder for flexible LIBs is developed, which equips a cross&#8208;linked supramolecular poly (urethane&#8208;urea) to the polyacrylic acid. The binder imparts super high elastic restorability originating from the meticulously engineered hydrogen&#8208;bonding segments as well as extraordinary adhesion. The developed binder provides excellent flexibility and intact electrode morphologies without disintegration even when the electrode is largely deformed, enabling a stable cycling and voltage output even the batteries are put under tough dynamic deformation tests. The flexible LIBs exhibit a high energy density of 420&#160;Wh L&#8722;1, which is remarkably higher than reported numbers. The unique binder design is greatly promising and offers a valuable material solution for LIBs with high&#8208;loading mass and flexible designs.

         <title>Hybrid Data&#8208;driven Discovery of High&#8208;performance Silver Selenide&#8208;based Thermoelectric Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Optimizing material compositions often enhances thermoelectric performances. However, the large selection of possible base elements and dopants results in a vast composition design space that is too large to systematically search using solely domain knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid data&#8208;driven strategy that integrates Bayesian Optimization (BO) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to optimize the composition of five elements (Ag, Se, S, Cu, and Te) in AgSe&#8208;based thermoelectric materials. We collect data from the literature to provide prior knowledge for the initial GPR model, which is updated by actively collected experimental data during the iteration between BO and experiments. Within seven iterations, the optimized AgSe&#8208;based materials prepared using a simple high&#8208;throughput ink mixing and blade coating method deliver a high power factor of 2100 &#956;W/mK2, which is a 75% improvement from the baseline composite (nominal composition of Ag2Se1). The success of our study provides opportunities to generalize the demonstrated active machine learning technique to accelerate the development and optimization of a wide range of material systems with reduced experimental trials.

The success of our study provides opportunities to generalize the demonstrated active machine learning technique to accelerate the development and optimization of a wide range of material systems with reduced experimental trials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Metal Core&#8208;Shell Nanoparticle Supercrystals: from Photo&#8208;Activation of Hydrogen Evolution to Photo&#8208;Corrosion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Gas nanobubbles are directly linked to many important chemical reactions. While they can be detrimental to operational devices, they also reflect the local activity at the nanoscale. In this work, supercrystals made of highly monodisperse Ag@Pt core&#8208;shell nanoparticles were first grown onto a solid support and fully characterized by electron microscopies and X&#8208;ray scattering. Supercrystals were then used as a plasmonic photo&#8208;catalytic platform for triggering hydrogen evolution reaction. The catalytic activity is measured operando at the single supercrystal level by high resolution optical microscopy which allows to probe gas nanobubbles nucleation at the early stage with high temporal resolution and to quantify the amount of gas molecules trapped inside them. Finally, a correlative microscopy approach and high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy helped to decipher the mechanisms at the origin of the local degradation of the supercrystals during catalysis, namely nanoscale erosion and corrosion.

         <title>Dry&#8208;Transferable Photoresist Enabled Reliable Conformal Patterning for Ultrathin Flexible Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microfabrication approach using synthesized high&#8208;resolution and environmentally friendly photoresists is demonstrated. This approach allows the transfer of photoresists onto various substrates to enable reliable conformal manufacturing of thin&#8208;film flexible electronics. Various exemplary demonstrations suggest the potential of this technology for many emerging applications, including flexible electronics, smart devices, bioelectronics, as well as human&#8208;machine interfaces.








Abstract
Photolithographic techniques, which are widely used in the silicon&#8208;based semiconductor industry, enable the manufacture of high&#8208;yield and high&#8208;resolution features at the micrometer and nanometer scales. However, conventional photolithographic processes cannot accommodate the micro/nanofabrication of flexible and stretchable electronics. In this study, a microfabrication approach that uses a synthesized, environmentally friendly, and dry&#8208;transferable photoresist to enable the reliable conformal manufacturing of thin&#8208;film electronics is reported, which is also compatible with the existing cleanroom processes. Photoresists with high&#8208;resolution, high&#8208;density, and multiscale patterns can be transferred onto various substrates in a defect&#8208;free and conformal&#8208;contact manner, thus enabling multiple wafer reuses. Theoretical studies are conducted to investigate the damage&#8208;free peel&#8208;off mechanism of the proposed approach. The in situ fabrication of various electrical components, including ultralight and ultrathin biopotential electrodes, has been demonstrated, which offer lower interfacial impedance, durability, and stability, and the components are applied to collect electromyography signals with superior signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) and quality. Additionally, an exemplary demonstration of a human&#8208;machine interface indicates the potential of these electrodes in many emerging applications, including healthcare, sensing, and artificial intelligence.

         <title>Unique Tridentate Coordination Tailored Solvation Sheath Toward Highly Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates bi/tridentate coordination by designing a single&#8208;solvent electrolyte for lithium metal batteries. A newly developed bis(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy)methane solvent featuring multiple oxygen ligand sites enables more anions access the solvation sheath, facilitating stable interfacial chemistryand fast de&#8208;solvation kinetics. The electrolyte exhibits good compatibility with high&#8208;loading cathodes and limited Li metal anodes, as well as wide&#8208;temperature adaptability for practical applications.








Abstract
Electrolyte optimization by solvent molecule design is recognized as an effective approach for stabilizing lithium (Li) metal batteries. However, the coordination pattern of Li ions&#160;(Li+) with solvent molecules is sparsely considered. Here, an electrolyte design strategy is reported based on bi/tridentate chelation of Li+ and solvent to tune the solvation structure. As a proof of concept, a novel solvent with multi&#8208;oxygen coordination sites is demonstrated to facilitate the formation of an anion&#8208;aggregated solvation shell, enhancing the interfacial stability and de&#8208;solvation kinetics. As a result, the as&#8208;developed electrolyte exhibits ultra&#8208;stable cycling over 1400&#160;h in symmetric cells with 50&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thin Li foils. When paired with high&#8208;loading LiFePO4, full cells maintain 92% capacity over 500 cycles and deliver improved electrochemical performances over a wide temperature range from &#8722;10 to 60&#160;&#176;C. Furthermore, the concept is validated in a pouch cell (570&#160;mAh), achieving a capacity retention of 99.5% after 100 cycles. This brand&#8208;new insight on electrolyte engineering provides guidelines for practical high&#8208;performance Li metal batteries.

         <title>Water&#8208;Resistant Conductive Gels toward Underwater Wearable Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Underwater wearable sensing is of great significance for improving the safety and efficiency of underwater activities. This review presents the representative design strategies for developing water&#8208;resistant conductive gels and their diversified applications in the underwater sensing field as wearable sensors, which provides guidance for promoting the rapid development of gel&#8208;based underwater wearable sensors.








Abstract
Conductive gels are developing vigorously as superior wearable sensing materials due to their intrinsic conductivity, softness, stretchability, and biocompatibility, showing a great potential in many aspects of lives. However, compared to their wide application on land, it is significant yet rather challenging for traditional conductive gels to realize sensing application under water. The swelling of gels and the loss of conductive components in the aqueous environment, resulted from the diffusion across the interface, lead to structural instability and sensing performance decline. Fortunately, great efforts are devoted to improving the water resistance of conductive gels and employing them in the field of underwater wearable sensing in recent years, and some exciting achievements are obtained, which are of great significance for promoting the safety and efficiency of underwater activities. However, there is no review to thoroughly summarize the underwater sensing application of conductive gels. This review presents a brief overview of the representative design strategies for developing water&#8208;resistant conductive gels and their diversified applications in the underwater sensing field as wearable sensors. Finally, the ongoing challenges for further developing water&#8208;resistant conductive gels for underwater wearable sensing are also discussed along with recommendations for the future.

         <title>Flowthrough Capture of Microplastics through Polyphenol&#8208;Mediated Interfacial Interactions on Wood Sawdust</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable, cost&#8208;effective, highly efficient, and bio&#8208;based flowthrough capturing materials (bioCap) are developed based on wood sawdust support for the removal of nano&#8208;/microplastics from water. Due to the unique advantage of phenolic&#8208;mediated multi&#8208;molecular interactions, bioCap is capable of capturing a broad spectrum of nano&#8208;/microplastics with various types (six types), surface charges (anionic, cationic, and neutral), and shapes (spherical and irregular).








Abstract
Nano&#8208;/microplastics accumulate in aquatic bodies and raise increasing threats to ecosystems and human health. The limitation of existing water cleanup strategies, especially in the context of nano&#8208;/microplastics, primarily arises from their complexity (morphological, compositional, and dimensional). Here, highly efficient and bio&#8208;based flowthrough capturing materials (bioCap) are reported to remove a broad spectrum of nano&#8208;/microplastics from water: polyethylene terephthalate (anionic, irregular shape), polyethylene (net neutral, irregular shape), polystyrene (anionic and cationic, spherical shape), and other anionic and spherical shaped particles (polymethyl methacrylate, polypropylene, and polyvinyl chloride). Highly efficient bioCap systems that adsorb the ubiquitous particles released from beverage bags are demonstrated. As evidence of removal from drinking water, the in vivo biodistribution of nano&#8208;/microplastics is profiled, confirming a significant reduction of particle accumulation in main organs. The unique advantage of phenolic&#8208;mediated multi&#8208;molecular interactions is employed in sustainable, cost&#8208;effective, and facile strategies based on wood sawdust support for the removal of challenging nano&#8208;/microplastics pollutions.

Abstract
Materialomics integrates experiment, theory, and computation in a high&#8208;throughput manner, and has changed the paradigm for the research and development of new functional materials. Recently, with the rapid development of high&#8208;throughput characterization and machine&#8208;learning technologies, the establishment of biomaterialomics that tackles complex physiological behaviors has become accessible. Breakthroughs in the clinical translation of nanoparticle&#8208;based therapeutics and vaccines have been observed. Herein, recent advances in biomaterials, including polymers, lipid&#8208;like materials, and peptides/proteins, discovered through high&#8208;throughput screening or machine learning&#8208;assisted methods, are summarized. The molecular design of structure&#8208;diversified libraries; high&#8208;throughput characterization, screening, and preparation; and, their applications in drug delivery and clinical translation are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the prospects and main challenges in future biomaterialomics and high&#8208;throughput screening development are highlighted.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Halide Perovskite Lasers: Cavity Formation and Emission Characteristics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review overviews approaches to find an optimal perovskite cavity patterning method, including indirect patterning, bottom&#8208;up patterning, top&#8208;down patterning, and top&#8208;down controlled bottom&#8208;up patterning. Fundamental mechanisms behind various emission behaviors in perovskite thin films and cavities are also compared and contrasted.








Abstract
Hybrid metal&#8208;halide perovskites (MHPs) have shown remarkable optoelectronic properties as well as facile and cost&#8208;effective processability. With the success of MHP solar cells and light&#8208;emitting diodes, MHPs have also exhibited great potential as gain media for on&#8208;chip lasers. However, to date, stable operation of optically pumped MHP lasers and electrically driven MHP lasers&#8212;an essential requirement for MHP laser's insertion into chip&#8208;scale photonic integrated circuits&#8212;is not yet demonstrated. The main obstacles include the instability of MHPs in the atmosphere, rudimentary MHP laser cavity patterning methods, and insufficient understanding of emission mechanisms in MHP materials and cavities. This review aims to provide a detailed overview of different strategies to improve the intrinsic properties of MHPs in the atmosphere and to establish an optimal MHP cavity patterning method. In addition, this review discusses different emission mechanisms in MHP materials and cavities and how to distinguish them.

         <title>Defect Engineering of a High&#8208;Entropy Metallic Glass Surface for High&#8208;Performance Overall Water Splitting at Ampere&#8208;Level Current Densities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A defect engineering strategy is presented to construct nanoporous high&#8208;entropy metallic glass with nanocrystalline surface structure that contains lattice distortion and stacking faults to achieve ultralow overpotentials at ampere&#8208;level current density. It retains a long&#8208;term durability of 200&#160;h. The excellent performance is attributed to the defects for optimizing atomic configuration while the nanoporous architecture providing abundant active sites.








Abstract
Platinum&#8208;based electrocatalysts possess high water electrolysis activity and are essential components for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). A major challenge, however, is how to break the cost&#8208;efficiency trade&#8208;off. Here, a novel defect engineering strategy is presented to construct a nanoporous (FeCoNiB0.75)97Pt3 (atomic %) high&#8208;entropy metallic glass (HEMG) with a nanocrystalline surface structure that contains large amounts of lattice distortion and stacking faults to achieve excellent electrocatalytic performance using only 3&#160;at% of Pt. The defect&#8208;rich HEMG achieves ultralow overpotentials at ampere&#8208;level current density of 1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for HER (104&#160;mV) and oxygen evolution reaction (301&#160;mV) under alkaline conditions, while retains a long&#8208;term durability exceeding 200&#160;h at 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, it only requires 81 and 122&#160;mV to drive the current densities of 1000 and 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for HER under acidic and neutral conditions, respectively. Modelling results reveal that lattice distortion and stacking fault defects help to optimize atomic configuration and modulate electronic interaction, while the surface nanoporous architecture provides abundant active sites, thus synergistically contributing to the reduced energy barrier for water electrolysis. This defect engineering approach combined with a HEMG design strategy is expected to be widely applicable for development of high&#8208;performance alloy catalysts.

         <title>Controllable Synthesis of 2H&#8208;1T&#8242; MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2 Lateral Heterostructures and Their Tunable Optoelectronic Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2H&#8208;1T&#8242;&#8201;MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2 lateral heterostructures are grown by a one&#8208;step chemical vapor deposition method, and the optoelectronic properties of 2H&#8201;MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2, 1T&#8242;&#8201;MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2, and MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2&#8208;based heterostructures are thoroughly studied. Under 405&#8201;nm laser irradiation, 2H&#8201;MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2 exhibits a positive photoconductive effect, while 1T&#8242;&#8201;MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2 shows a negative photoconductive effect. The optoelectronic response characteristics of MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2&#8208;based heterostructures can be modulated by gate voltage.








Abstract
Constructing heterostructures and doping are valid ways to improve the optoelectronic properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and optimize the performance of TMDs&#8208;based photodetectors. Compared with transfer techniques, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has higher efficiency in preparing heterostructures. As for the one&#8208;step CVD growth of heterostructures, cross&#8208;contamination between the two materials may occur during the growth process, which may provide the possibility of one&#8208;step simultaneous realization of controllable doping and formation of alloy&#8208;based heterostructures by finely tuning the growth dynamics. Here, 2H&#8208;1T&#8242; MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2 alloy&#8208;to&#8208;alloy lateral heterostructures are synthesized through this one&#8208;step CVD growth method, utilizing the cross&#8208;contamination and different growth temperatures of the two alloys. Due to the doping of a small amount of Re atoms in 2H MoS2, 2H MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2 has a high response rejection ratio in the solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet (SBUV) region and exhibits a positive photoconductive (PPC) effect. While the 1T&#8242; MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2 formed by heavily doping Mo atoms into 1T' ReS2 will produce a negative photoconductivity (NPC) effect under UV laser irradiation. The optoelectronic property of 2H&#8208;1T&#8242; MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2&#8208;based heterostructures can be modulated by gate voltage. These findings are expected to expand the functionality of traditional optoelectronic devices and have potential applications in optoelectronic logic devices.

         <title>Direct&#8208;Current Electrical Detection of Surface&#8208;Acoustic&#8208;Wave&#8208;Driven Ferromagnetic Resonance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel electrical detection technique is developed for the magneto&#8208;elastic effective field of surface acoustic wave (SAW), showing advantages of better integration compatibility and lower cost than traditional techniques like vector network analyzer. It is made possible by the direct current rectification effect of the SAW&#8208;driven ferromagnetic resonance, paving the way for designable spin acousto&#8208;electronic devices with convenient signal readout.








Abstract
Surface acoustic waves (SAW) provide a promising platform to study spin&#8208;phonon coupling, which can be achieved by SAW&#8208;driven ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) for efficient acoustic manipulation of spin. Although the magneto&#8208;elastic effective field model has achieved great success in describing SAW&#8208;driven FMR, the magnitude of the effective field acting on the magnetization induced by SAW still remains hard to access. Here, by integrating ferromagnetic stripes with SAW devices, direct&#8208;current detection for SAW&#8208;driven FMR based on electrical rectification is reported. By analyzing FMR rectified voltage, the effective fields are straightforwardly characterized and extracted, which exhibits&#160;the advantages of better integration compatibility and lower cost than traditional methods such as vector&#8208;network analyzer&#8208;based techniques. A large nonreciprocal rectified voltage is obtained, which is attributed to the coexistence of in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane effective fields. The effective fields can be modulated by controlling the longitudinal and shear strains within the films to achieve almost 100% nonreciprocity ratio, demonstrating the potential for electrical switches. Besides its fundamental significance, this finding provides a unique opportunity for a designable spin acousto&#8208;electronic device and its convenient signal readout.

         <title>An Exciplex&#8208;Based Light&#8208;Emission Pathway for Solution&#8208;State Electrochemiluminescent Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrical generation of exciplex states improves the efficiency and robustness of electrochemiluminescence (ECL) in solution. Mesoporous TiO2 electrodes increase the contact area and further enhance ECL. A solution&#8208;state ECL device combining both principles reaches a high luminance of 3790&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and offers a 30&#8208;fold improvement in operational lifetime.








Abstract
Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) allows the design of unique light&#8208;emitting devices that use organic semiconductors in a liquid or gel state, which allows for simpler and more sustainable device fabrication and facilitates unconventional device form&#8208;factors. Compared to solid&#8208;state organic LEDs, ECL devices (ECLDs) have attracted less attention due to their currently much lower performance. ECLD operation is typically based on an annihilation pathway that involves electron transfer between reduced and oxidized luminophore species; the intermediate radical ions produced during annihilation dramatically reduce device stability. Here, the effects of radical ions are mitigated by an exciplex formation pathway and a remarkable improvement in luminance, luminous efficacy, and operational lifetime is demonstrated. Electron donor and acceptor molecules are dissolved at high concentrations and recombined as an exciplex upon their oxidization/reduction. The exciplex then transfers its energy to a nearby dye, allowing the dye to emit light without undergoing oxidation/reduction. Furthermore, the application of a mesoporous TiO2 electrode increases the contact area and hence the number of molecules participating in ECL , thereby obtaining devices with a very high luminance of 3790&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and a 30&#8208;fold improved operational lifetime. This study paves the way for the development of ECLDs into highly versatile light sources.

         <title>Extreme &#947;&#8208;Ray Radiation Tolerance of Spectrometer&#8208;Grade CsPbBr3 Perovskite Detectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How the new radiation detector material, CsPbBr3, holds up to high radiation doses often found in industrial settings and extreme radiation in space is evaluated. Remarkable stability is observed in detector performance after exposure to 1&#160;Mrad of Co&#8208;60 gamma radiation, with many devices still functional after being exposed to a 10&#160;Mrad dose over 3 days. Those that do not survive can still be refabricated into working detectors.








Abstract
The perovskite compound CsPbBr3 has recently been discovered as a promising room&#8208;temperature semiconductor radiation detector, offering an inexpensive and easy&#8208;to&#8208;manufacture alternative to the current benchmark material Cd1&#8722;xZnxTe (CZT). The performance of CsPbBr3 sensors is evaluated under harsh conditions, such as high radiation doses often found in industrial settings and extreme radiation in space. Results show minimal degradation in detector performance after exposure to 1&#160;Mrad of Co&#8208;60 gamma radiation, with no significant change to energy resolution or hole mobility and lifetime. Additionally, many of the devices are still functional after being exposed to a 10&#160;Mrad dose over 3 days, and those that do not survive can still be refabricated into working detectors. These results suggest that the failure mode in these devices is likely related to the interface between the electrode and material and their reaction, or the electrode itself and not the material itself. Overall, the study suggests that CsPbBr3 has high potential as a reliable and efficient radiation detector in various applications, including those involving extreme fluxes and energies of gamma&#8208;ray radiation.

         <title>Esterase&#8208;Labile Quaternium Lipidoid Enabling Improved mRNA&#8208;LNP Stability and Spleen&#8208;Selective mRNA Transfection</title>

Abstract
Ionizable cationic lipids are recognized as an essential component of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery but can be confounded by low lipoplex stability with mRNA during storage and in vivo delivery. Herein, the rational design and combinatorial synthesis of esterase&#8208;triggered decationizable quaternium lipid&#8208;like molecules (lipidoids) is reported to develop new LNPs with high delivery efficiency and improved storage stability. This top lipidoid carries positive charges at the physiological condition but promptly acquires negative charges in the presence of esterase, thus permitting stable mRNA encapsulation during storage and in vivo delivery while balancing efficient mRNA release in the cytosol. An optimal LNP formulation is then identified through orthogonal optimization, which enables efficacious mRNA transfection selectively in spleen following intravenous administration. LNP&#8208;mediated delivery of ovalbumin (OVA)&#8208;encoding mRNA induces efficient antigen expression in antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs) and elicits robust antigen&#8208;specific immune responses against OVA&#8208;transduced tumors. The work demonstrates potential of decationizable quaternium lipidoids for spleen&#8208;selective mRNA transfection and cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>The Role of Optical Phonon Confinement in The Infrared Dielectric Response of III&#8208;V Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polar dielectrics are key materials of interest for infrared (IR) nanophotonic applications due to their ability to host phonon&#8208;polaritons (PhPs) that allow for low&#8208;loss, subdiffractional control of light. The properties of phonon&#8208;polaritons are limited by the characteristics of optical phonons, which are nominally fixed for most &#8220;bulk&#8221; materials. Superlattices composed of alternating atomically&#8208;thin materials offer control over crystal anisotropy through changes in composition, optical phonon confinement, and the emergence of new modes. In particular, the modified optical phonons in superlattices offer the potential for so&#8208;called crystalline hybrids whose IR properties cannot be described as a simple mixture of the bulk constituents. To date, however, studies have primarily focused on identifying the presence of new or modified optical phonon modes rather than assessing their impact on the IR response. This study focuses on assessing the impact of confined optical phonon modes on the hybrid IR dielectric function in superlattices of GaSb and AlSb. Using a combination of first principles theory, Raman, FTIR, and spectroscopic ellipsometry, the hybrid dielectric function is found to track with the confinement of optical phonons, leading to optical phonon spectral shifts of up to 20 cm&#8722;1. These results provide an alternative pathway towards designer IR optical materials.

         <title>Tunable Chiral Plasmonic Activities Enabled via Stimuli Responsive Micro&#8208;Origami</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Chiral plasmonic nanomaterials with distinctive circularly polarized light&#8208;dependent optical response over broad range of frequency have great potential for photonic and biomedical applications. However, it still remains challenging to fabricate 3D plasmonic chiral micro&#8208;constructs with readily modulated chiroptical properties over the magnitude of ellipticity, mode frequency and switchable handedness, especially in the visible to near&#8208;infrared range. In this study, polymeric micro&#8208;origami based 3D plasmonic chiral structures are constructed through self&#8208;rolling of gold nanoparticles (AuNS)&#8208;decorated polymeric micro&#8208;sheets. Spherical AuNSs are assembled as highly ordered linear chains on 2D rectangular micro&#8208;sheets by polydimethylsiloxane&#8208;wrinkle assisted assembly. Upon rolling the micro&#8208;sheets to micro&#8208;tubules, the AuNS chains transform into 3D helices. The AuNS assembled helices induce collective plasmonic modes propagating in a helical manner, leading to strong chiral response over Vis&#8208;NIR range. The circular dichroism (CD) is measured to be as high as hundreds millidegree, and the position and sign of CD peaks are actively modulated by controlling the orientated angle of AuNS chains, enabled by tuning the collective plasmonic modes. This micro&#8208;origami based strategy incorporated the incompatible 2D assembly technique with 3D chiral structures, opening up an intriguing way towards constructing chiral plasmonic structures and modulating of chiroptical effects based on responsive polymeric materials.

&lt;p&gt;Chiral plasmonic nanomaterials with distinctive circularly polarized light-dependent optical response over broad range of frequency have great potential for photonic and biomedical applications. However, it still remains challenging to fabricate 3D plasmonic chiral micro-constructs with readily modulated chiroptical properties over the magnitude of ellipticity, mode frequency and switchable handedness, especially in the visible to near-infrared range. In this study, polymeric micro-origami based 3D plasmonic chiral structures are constructed through self-rolling of gold nanoparticles (AuNS)-decorated polymeric micro-sheets. Spherical AuNSs are assembled as highly ordered linear chains on 2D rectangular micro-sheets by polydimethylsiloxane-wrinkle assisted assembly. Upon rolling the micro-sheets to micro-tubules, the AuNS chains transform into 3D helices. The AuNS assembled helices induce collective plasmonic modes propagating in a helical manner, leading to strong chiral response over Vis-NIR range. The circular dichroism (CD) is measured to be as high as hundreds millidegree, and the position and sign of CD peaks are actively modulated by controlling the orientated angle of AuNS chains, enabled by tuning the collective plasmonic modes.

         <title>A New Strategy to Elevate Absorptivity of AIEgens for Intensified Nir&#8208;Ii Emission And Synergized Multimodality Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
High&#8208;efficiency absorptivity is crucial for the construction of high&#8208;performance luminescent materials, especially the long&#8208;wavelength near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) materials, thus seeking an efficient and universal strategy to elevate the absorptivity is extremely important but is still an intractable challenge. In this work, we discovered a simple but efficient design strategy involving the introduction of gold(I) unit that could effectively elevate the absorptivity of aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens). As a result of the efficient elevation of absorptivity, the representative AIE&#8208;active TBTP&#8208;Au showed more superior NIR&#8208;II (1220&#160;nm) luminescence, much higher photothermal conversion efficiency, and unique intracellular reactive oxygen species generating ability compared with that of the TBTP ligand. Take advantage of these improvements, the fabricated tumor&#8208;targeting TBTP&#8208;Au&#8208;cRGD nanoparticles achieved specific NIR&#8208;II tumorous imaging in vivo and exerted high&#8208;efficiency cancer therapy via the synergistic chemotherapy and photothermal therapy. Thus, this work provides a new and efficient strategy to construct high&#8208;absorption luminescent materials and demonstrates the great potential of gold(I)&#8208;based AIEgens as multifunctional theranostic agents.

         <title>Overcoming Charge Confinement in Perovskite Nanocrystal Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A re&#8208;assembling process is developed to overcome the charge confinement in perovskite nanocrystalline films (PeNCs) made of colloidal perovskite nanocrystals, by increasing the crystallite size and removing the long&#8208;chain ligands. Use of this strategy in gradient&#8208;bandgap PeNC solar cells achieves a high Jsc of 19.30&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a power conversion efficiency of 16.46%.








Abstract
The small nanoparticle size and long&#8208;chain ligands in colloidal metal halide perovskite quantum dots (PeQDs) cause charge confinement, which impedes exciton dissociation and carrier extraction in PeQD solar cells, so they have low short&#8208;circuit current density Jsc, which impedes further increases in their power conversion efficiency (PCE). Here, a re&#8208;assembling process (RP) is developed for perovskite nanocrystalline (PeNC) films made of colloidal perovskite nanocrystals to increase Jsc in PeNC solar cells. The RP of PeNC films increases their crystallite size and eliminates long&#8208;chain ligands, and thereby overcomes the charge confinement in PeNC films. These changes facilitate exciton dissociation and increase carrier extraction in PeNC solar cells. By use of this method, the gradient&#8208;bandgap PeNC solar cells achieve a Jsc = 19.30&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 without compromising the photovoltage, and yield a high PCE of 16.46% with negligible hysteresis and good stability. This work provides a new strategy to process PeNC films and pave the way for high performance PeNC optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Carbonization &#8211; A Powerful Tool for Micro&#8208;Fabrication of Patterned Electronic Carbons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A review on fundamentals and potential applications: Laser&#8208;induced carbonization is a versatile tool for the direct fabrication of functional carbon patterns. By selection of precursors and process parameters, the properties of the laser&#8208;patterned carbons are tuned to meet the materials requirements for different applications like micro&#8208;energy storage, electrocatalysis, sensors, or antenna&#8208;related devices.








Abstract
Fabricating electronic devices from natural, renewable resources is a common goal in engineering and materials science. In this regard, carbon is of special significance due to its biocompatibility combined with electrical conductivity and electrochemical stability. In microelectronics, however, carbon's device application is often inhibited by tedious and expensive preparation processes and a lack of control over processing and material parameters. Laser&#8208;assisted carbonization is emerging as a tool for the precise and selective synthesis of functional carbon&#8208;based materials for flexible device applications. In contrast to conventional carbonization via in&#8208;furnace pyrolysis, laser&#8208;carbonization is induced photo&#8208;thermally and occurs on the time&#8208;scale of milliseconds. By careful selection of the precursors and process parameters, the properties of this so&#8208;called laser&#8208;patterned carbon (LP&#8208;C) such as porosity, surface polarity, functional groups, degree of graphitization, charge&#8208;carrier structure, etc. can be tuned. In this critical review, a common perspective is generated on laser&#8208;carbonization in the context of general carbonization strategies, fundamentals of laser&#8208;induced materials processing, and flexible electronic applications, like electrodes for sensors, electrocatalysts, energy storage, or antennas. An attempt is made to have equal emphasis on material processing and application aspects such that this emerging technology can be optimally positioned in the broader context of carbon&#8208;based microfabrication.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designing artificial neurons and synapses with on demand properties is considered crucial for the development of new&#8208;type hardware for the future neuromorphic computing. This review discusses the common electrochemical fundamentals between biological and redox&#8208;based memristive cells and the ways to control and tune the device functionalities. Examples on recent achievements in the array implementation of these systems are provided.








Abstract
Artificial neurons and synapses are considered essential for the progress of the future brain&#8208;inspired computing, based on beyond von Neumann architectures. Here, a discussion on the common electrochemical fundamentals of biological and artificial cells is provided, focusing on their similarities with the redox&#8208;based memristive devices. The driving forces behind the functionalities and the ways to control them by an electrochemical&#8208;materials approach are presented. Factors such as the chemical symmetry of the electrodes, doping of the solid electrolyte, concentration gradients, and excess surface energy are discussed as essential to understand, predict, and design artificial neurons and synapses. A variety of two&#8208; and three&#8208;terminal memristive devices and memristive architectures are presented and their application for solving various problems is shown. The work provides an overview of the current understandings on the complex processes of neural signal generation and transmission in both biological and artificial cells and presents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications, including signal transmission between biological and artificial cells. This example is showcasing the possibility for creating bioelectronic interfaces and integrating artificial circuits in biological systems. Prospectives and challenges of the modern technology toward low&#8208;power, high&#8208;information&#8208;density circuits are highlighted.

The driving forces behind the functionalities and the ways to control them by an electrochemical-materials approach are presented. Factors such as the chemical symmetry of the electrodes, doping of the solid electrolyte, concentration gradients, and excess surface energy are discussed as essential to understand, predict, and design artificial neurons and synapses. A variety of two- and three-terminal memristive devices and memristive architectures are presented and their application for solving various problems is shown. The work provides an overview of the current understandings on the complex processes of neural signal generation and transmission in both biological and artificial cells and presents the state-of-the-art applications, including signal transmission between biological and artificial cells. This example is showcasing the possibility for creating bioelectronic interfaces and integrating artificial circuits in biological systems. Prospectives and challenges of the modern technology toward low-power, high-information-density circuits are highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aerosol&#8208;Jet&#8208;Printable Covalent Organic Framework Colloidal Inks and Temperature&#8208;Sensitive Nanocomposite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pre&#8208;synthesized, solution&#8208;processable covalent organic framework (COF) colloidal ink is demonstrated that enables aerosol jet printing of COFs with micron&#8208;scale resolution. The ink formulation is also compatible with other colloidal nanomaterials, thus facilitating the integration of COFs into printable nanocomposite films with highly tunable properties such as strongly temperature&#8208;dependent electrical conductivity.








Abstract
With molecularly well&#8208;defined and tailorable 2D structures, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as leading material candidates for chemical sensing, storage, separation, and catalysis. In these contexts, the ability to directly and deterministically print COFs into arbitrary geometries will enable rapid optimization and deployment. However, previous attempts to print COFs have been restricted by low spatial resolution and/or post&#8208;deposition polymerization that limits the range of compatible COFs. Here, these limitations are overcome with a pre&#8208;synthesized, solution&#8208;processable colloidal ink that enables aerosol jet printing of COFs with micron&#8208;scale resolution. The ink formulation utilizes the low&#8208;volatility solvent benzonitrile, which is critical to obtaining homogeneous printed COF film morphologies. This ink formulation is also compatible with other colloidal nanomaterials, thus facilitating the integration of COFs into printable nanocomposite films. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, boronate&#8208;ester COFs are integrated with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to form printable COF&#8208;CNT nanocomposite films, in which the CNTs enhance charge transport and temperature sensing performance, ultimately resulting in high&#8208;sensitivity temperature sensors that show electrical conductivity variation by 4 orders of magnitude between room temperature and 300&#160;&#176;C. Overall, this work establishes a flexible platform for COF additive manufacturing that will accelerate the incorporation of COFs into technologically significant applications.

         <title>Curb Exosome Communications via Introducing Artificial Membrane Receptors for Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tumor&#8208;derived exosomes (TDEs) carry various biomolecular cargos and play crucial roles in metastasis. TDEs migrate to distal organs for intercellular communication and induce the formation of pre&#8208;metastatic niches (PMNs) to support tumor implantation and proliferation. Precise interference in the bioprocess of TDEs is expected to be efficacious for suppressing tumor metastasis. However, targeting both TDEs and the primary tumor is challenging. Here, based on metabolic glycoengineering and bio&#8208;orthogonal click chemistry, a two&#8208;step delivery strategy is designed to overcome this. During the first step, the tetraacetylated&#160;N&#8208;azidoacetyl&#8208;d&#8208;mannosamine&#8208;loaded nanoparticle responds to the metabolic activity of tumor cells in the primary tumor, tagging both tumor cells and TDEs with azide groups; dibenzyl cyclootyne&#8208;modified nanoparticles then can, as the second step, specifically react with tumor cells and TDEs through a bio&#8208;orthogonal click reaction. Our strategy not only inhibits tumor growth in pancreatic cancer models but also curbs the communicative role of TDEs in inducing liver PMNs and metastasis by tracking and downregulating the exosomal macrophage migration inhibitory factor.

         <title>Modulating the Active Hydrogen Adsorption on Fe&#8208;N Interface for Boosted Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction with Ultra&#8208;long Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The electrocatalytic reduction of nitrates to nitrogen is an environmentally friendly approach for efficient N&#8208;cycle management (towards a nitrogen&#8208;neutral cycle). However, poor catalyst durability and the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction significantly impede its practical application. Interface&#8208;chemistry engineering, utilizing the close relationship between the catalyst surface/interface microenvironment and electron/proton transfer process, has facilitated the development of catalysts with high intrinsic activity and physicochemical durability. This study reports the synthesis of a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;coated rice&#8208;like iron nitride (RL&#8208;Fe2N@NC) electrocatalyst with excellent electrocatalytic nitrate&#8208;reduction reaction (NO3RR) activity (high N2 selectivity (&#8764;96%) and NO3&#8722; conversion (&#8764;86%)). According to detailed mechanistic investigations by in&#8208;situ tests and theoretical calculations, the strong hydrogenation ability of iron nitride and enhanced nitrate enrichment of the system synergistically contributed to the rapid hydrogenation of nitrogen&#8208;containing species, increasing the intrinsic activity of the catalyst and reducing the occurrence of the competing hydrogen&#8208;evolution side reaction. Moreover, RL&#8208;Fe2N@NC showed excellent stability, retaining good NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;N2 electrocatalysis activity for more than 40 cycles (one cycle per day). This paper could guide the interfacial design of Fe&#8208;based composite nanostructures for electrocatalytic nitrate reduction, facilitating a shift towards nitrogen neutrality.

         <title>Co&#8208;Delivery of Metabolic Modulators Leads to Simultaneous Lactate Metabolism Inhibition And Intracellular Acidification for Synergistic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Simultaneous lactate metabolism inhibition and intracellular acidification (LIIA) is a promising approach for inducing tumor regression by depleting ATP. However, given the limited efficacy of individual metabolic modulators, a combination of various modulators is required for highly efficient LIIA. Herein, a co&#8208;delivery system that combines lactate transporter inhibitor, glucose oxidase, and O2&#8208;evolving nanoparticles is proposed. As a vehicle, a facile room&#8208;temperature synthetic method for large&#8208;pore mesoporous silica nanoparticles (L&#8208;MSNs) is developed. O2&#8208;evolving nanoparticles are then conjugated onto L&#8208;MSNs, followed by immobilizing the lactate transporter inhibitor and glucose oxidase inside the pores of L&#8208;MSNs. To load the lactate transporter inhibitor, which is too small to be directly loaded into the large pores, it is encapsulated in albumin by controlling the albumin conformation before being loaded into L&#8208;MSNs. Notably, inhibiting lactate efflux shifts the glucose consumption mechanism from lactate metabolism to glucose oxidase reaction, which eliminates glucose and produces acid. This leads to synergistic LIIA and subsequent ATP depletion in cancer cells. Consequently, L&#8208;MSN&#8208;based co&#8208;delivery of modulators for LIIA shows high anticancer efficacy in several mouse tumor models without toxicity in normal tissues. This study provides new insights into co&#8208;delivery of small&#8208;molecule drugs, proteins, and nanoparticles for synergistic metabolic modulation in tumors.

         <title>Intrinsic Ferromagnetic Semiconductors with High Saturation Magnetization from Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ferromagnetic semiconductors (FMS) enable simultaneous control of both charge and spin transport of charge carriers, which have emerged as a class of highly desirable but rare material for applications in spin field&#8208;effect transistors and quantum computing. Organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite with high compositional adjustability and structural versatility can offer unique benefits in the design of FMS but has not been fully explored. Here we demonstrate a series of molecular FMSs based on two&#8208;dimensional organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite structure, namely (2ampy)CuCl4, (3ampy)CuCl4 and (4ampy)CuCl4, which exhibits high saturation magnetization, dramatic temperature&#8208;dependent conductivity change and tunable ferromagnetic resonance. Magnetic measurements revealed high saturation magnetization up to 18.56 emu/g for (4ampy)CuCl4, which is one of the highest value among reported hybrid FMSs to date. Conductivity studies of the three FMSs demonstrate that the smaller adjacent octahedron distance in the two&#8208;dimensional layer results in higher conductivity. Systematic ferromagnetic resonance investigation shows that the gyromagnetic ratio and Landau factor values are strongly dependent on the types of organic cations used. This work demonstrates that two&#8208;dimensional hybrid perovskite materials can simultaneously possess both tunable long&#8208;range ferromagnetic ordering and semiconductivity, providing a straightforward strategy for designing and synthesizing high&#8208;performance intrinsic FMSs.

Abstract
Photovoltaic windows with easy installation for the power supply of household appliances have long been a desire of energy researchers. However, due to the lack of top electrodes that offer both high transparency and low sheet resistance, the development of high transparency photovoltaic windows for indoor lighting scenarios has lagged significantly behind photovoltaic windows where privacy issues are involved. Addressing this issue, in this work we develop a solution processable transparent top electrode using sandwich structure silver nanowires, realizing high transparency in semi&#8208;transparent organic solar cells. The wettability and conducting properties of the electrode are improved by a modified hole&#8208;transport layer named HP. The semi&#8208;transparent solar cell exhibits good see&#8208;through properties at a high average visible transmittance of 50.8%, with power conversion efficiency of 7.34%, and light utilization efficiency of 3.73%, which is the highest without optical modulations. Moreover, flexible devices based on the above&#8208;mentioned architecture also show excellent mechanical tolerance compared with Ag electrode counterparts, which retains 94.5% of their original efficiency after 1500 bending cycles. This work provides a valuable approach for fabricating solution processed high transparency organic solar cells, which is essential in future applications in building integrated photovoltaics.

         <title>Synchronous diagnosis of respiratory viruses variants via receptonics based on modeling receptor&#8210;ligand dynamics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The transmission and pathogenesis of highly contagious fatal respiratory viruses are increasing, and the need for an on&#8208;site diagnostic platform has arisen as an issue worldwide. Furthermore, as the spread of respiratory virus continues, different variants have become the dominant circulating strains. To prevent virus transmission, the development of highly sensitive and accurate on&#8208;site diagnostic assays is urgently needed. Herein, we present a facile diagnostic device for multi&#8208;detection based on the results of detailed receptor&#8210;ligand dynamics simulations for the screening of various viral strains. Our novel bioreceptor&#8210;treated electronics (receptonics) device consists of a multichannel graphene transistor and cell&#8208;entry receptors conjugated to N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC). We achieved ultrasensitive multi&#8208;detection performance without the need for sample pretreatment, which will enable rapid diagnosis and prevent the spread of pathogens. This platform can be applied for the diagnosis of variants of concern in clinical respiratory virus samples and primate models. Our multi&#8208;screening platform can be used to enhance surveillance and discriminate emerging virus variants before they become a severe threat to public health.

         <title>Compact Hole&#8208;selective Self&#8208;assembled Monolayers Enabled by Disassembling Micelles in Solution for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) have been widely employed as effective hole&#8208;selective layers (HSLs) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, most SAM molecules are amphiphilic in nature and tend to form micelles in the commonly used alcoholic processing solvents. This introduces an extra energetic barrier to disassemble the micelles during the binding of SAM molecules on the substrate surface, limiting the formation of a compact SAM. To alleviate this problem for achieving optimal SAM growth, we&#160;develop a co&#8208;solvent strategy to disassemble the micelles of carbazole&#8208;based SAM molecules in the processing solution. This effectively increases the critical micelle concentration to be above the processing concentration and enhances the reactivity of the phosphonic acid anchoring group to allow densely packed SAMs to be formed on ITO. Consequently, the PSCs derived from using MeO&#8208;2PACz, 2PACz, and CbzNaph SAM HSLs showed universally improved performance, with the CbzNaph SAM derived device achieving a champion efficiency of 24.98% and improved stability.

         <title>A 3d&#8208;4d&#8208;5d High Entropy Alloy as a Bifunctional Oxygen Catalyst for Robust Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The development of cost&#8208;effective catalysts for oxygen evolution and reduction reactions (OER/ORR) is essential for the commercialization of zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs). High entropy alloys (HEAs) are highly suitable candidates as they offer numerous parameters for optimizing the electronic structure and catalytic sites. Herein, FeCoNiMoW HEA nanoparticles are synthesized using a solution&#8208;based low&#8208;temperature approach. Such FeCoNiMoW nanoparticles show high entropy properties, subtle lattice distortions, and modulated electronic structure, leading to superior OER performance with an overpotential of 233&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA/cm2 and 276&#160;mV at 100&#160;mA/cm2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the electronic structures of the FeCoNiMoW active sites with an optimized d&#8208;band center position that enables suitable adsorption of OOH* intermediates, and reduces the Gibbs free energy barrier in the OER process. Aqueous ZABs based on this HEA demonstrate a high open circuit potential of 1.59&#160;V, a peak power density of 116.9&#160;mW/cm2, a specific capacity of 857 mAh/gZn, and excellent stability for over 660&#160;h of continuous charge&#8208;discharge cycles. Flexible and solid ZABs are also assembled and tested, displaying excellent charge&#8208;discharge performance at different bending angles. This work shows the significance of 4d/5d metal&#8208;modulated electronic structure and optimized adsorption ability to improve the performance of OER/ORR, ZABs, and beyond.

         <title>In Situ Generated Electron&#8208;Blocking Lih Enabling An Unprecedented Critical Current Density of Over 15&#160;Ma Cm&#8722;2 for Solid&#8208;State Hydride Electrolytes</title>

Abstract
LiBH4 is a promising solid&#8208;state electrolyte due to its thermodynamic stability to Li. However, poor Li&#8208;ion conductivities at room temperature, low oxidative stabilities and severe dendrite growth hamper its application. Herein, we&#160;adopted a partial dehydrogenation strategy to in situ generate an electronic blocking layer dispersed of LiH, addressing the above three issues simuteneously. The electrically insulated LiH reduces the electronic conductivity by two orders of magnitude, leading to a 32.0&#8208;times higher critical electrical bias for dendrite growth on the particle surfaces than that of the counterpart. Additionally, this layer not only promotes the Li&#8208;ion conductance by stimulating coordinated rotations of BH4&#8722; and B12H122&#8722;, contributing to a Li&#8208;ion conductivity of 1.38 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C, but also greatly enhances oxidation stability by localizing the electron density on BH4&#8722;, extending its voltage window to 6.0&#160;V. Consequently, this electrolyte exhibits an unprecedented critical current density of 15.12&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 25 &#176;C, long&#8208;term Li plating and stripping stability for 2700&#160;h, and a wide temperature window for dendrite inhibition from &#8722;30 to 150 &#176;C. Its Li&#8208;LiCoO2 cell displayed high reversibility within 3.0 to 5.0&#160;V. We believe this work provides a clear direction for solid&#8208;state hydride electrolytes.

Abstract
The recent intensification of the study of contact&#8208;electrification at water&#8208;solid interfaces and its role in physicochemical processes lead to the realization that electron transfers during water&#8208;solid contact&#8208;electrification could drive chemical reactions. This mechanism, named contact&#8208;electro&#8208;catalysis (CEC), allows chemically inert fluorinated polymers to act like single electrode electrochemical systems. This study shows hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is generated from air and deionized water, by ultrasound driven CEC, using fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) as the catalyst. For a mass ratio of catalyst to solution of 1:10000, at 20&#176;C, the kinetic rate of H2O2 evolution reaches 58.87&#160;mmol L&#8722;1 gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) shows electrons are emitted in the solution by the charged FEP, during ultrasonication. EPR and isotope labelling experiments show H2O2 is formed from hydroxyl radicals (HO&#8226;) or two superoxide radicals (O2&#8226;&#8722;) generated by CEC. Finally, it is traditionally believed such radicals migrate in the solution by Brownian diffusion prior to reactions. However, Ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamic calculations reveals the radicals can react by exchanging protons and electrons through the hydrogen bonds network of water, i.e., owing to the Grotthuss mechanism. This mechanism could be relevant to other systems, artificial or natural, generating H2O2 from air and water.

         <title>Realizing Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting by Modulating Thickness&#8208;Induced Reaction Energy Barrier of Fluorenone&#8208;based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>

Abstract
Direct photocatalytic hydrogen and oxygen evolution from water splitting is an attractive approach for producing chemical fuels. For the first time, a novel fluorenone&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF&#8208;SCAU&#8208;2) was successfully exfoliated into ultrathin three&#8208;layer nanosheets (UCOF&#8208;SCAU&#8208;2) for photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS) under visible light. The ultrathin structures of UCOF&#8208;SCAU&#8208;2 greatly enhance carrier separation, utilization efficiency, and the exposure of active surface sites. Surprisingly, UCOF&#8208;SCAU&#8208;2 exhibited efficient photocatalytic OWS, with hydrogen and oxygen evolution rates reaching 0.046 and 0.021 mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1, respectively,&#160;under visible light irradiation, whereas bulk COF&#8208;SCAU&#8208;2 showed no activity for photocatalytic OWS. Charge carrier kinetic analysis and DFT calculation confirmed that reducing the thickness of COFs nanosheets increased&#160;the number of&#160;accessible active sites, reduced the distance for charge migration, prolong the lifetimes of photogenerated carriers and decrease the rate&#8208;limiting step Gibbs free energy than non&#8208;exfoliated COFs. This work offers new insights into the effect of the layer thickness of COF on photocatalytic OWS.

         <title>Enriching Metal&#8208;Oxygen Species and Phosphate Modulating of Active Sites for Robust Electrocatalytical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Direct electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) into value&#8208;added chemicals is a promising solution to reduce carbon emissions. The activity of CO2RR is influenced deeply by the reaction microenvironment and electronic properties of the catalysts. Herein, the surface PO43&#8722; anions are tuned to modulate the local microenvironment and the electronic properties of indium&#8208;based catalyst with abundant metal&#8208;oxygen species enabling efficient electrochemical conversion of CO2 to HCOO&#8722;. Indium nanoparticles coupled with PO43&#8722; anions (PO43&#8722;&#8208;In NPs) achieved a high selectivity of HCOO&#8722; up to 91.4% at a low potential of &#8208;0.98 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE), and a high HCOO&#8722; partial current density of 279.3 mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8208;1.1 V vs. RHE in the electrochemical flow cell. In&#8208;situ and ex&#8208;situ characterizations confirmed the PO43&#8722; anions kept stable on the surface of indium during CO2RR, accelerating the generation of OCHO* intermediate. From density functional theory (DFT) calculations, PO43&#8722; anions enriched the metal&#8208;oxygen species on the substrate to optimize the electronic structure of the catalysts and induced a local microenvironment with massive K+ ions on the interface, thus reducing the activation energy barrier of CO2RR.

         <title>Engineering Functionalized 2D Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Nanosheets with Fast Li+ Conduction for Advanced Solid Li&#160;Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functionalized two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) sheets have been designed through molecular engineering to construct high&#8208;performance composite electrolytes, where the electron&#8208;donating effect of substituents in 2D&#8208;MOFs effectively limits the movement of ClO4&#8208; and promotes mechanical properties and ion migration numbers (0.36 up to 0.64) of poly(ethylene oxide), delivering largely enhanced electrochemical performance. 








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state batteries can ensure high energy density and safety in lithium metal batteries, while polymer electrolytes are plagued by slow ion kinetics and low selective transport of Li+. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are proposed as emerging fillers for solid&#8208;state poly(ethylene oxide)(PEO) electrolytes, however, developing functionalized MOFs and understanding their roles on ion transfer has proven challenging. Herein, combining computational and experimental results, the functional group regulation in MOFs can effectively change surficial charge distribution and limit anion movement is revealed, providing a potential solution to these issues. Specifically, functionalized 2D MOF sheets are designed through molecular engineering to construct high&#8208;performance composite electrolytes, where the electron&#8208;donating effect of substituents in 2D&#8208;MOFs effectively limits the movement of ClO4&#8722; and promotes mechanical properties and ion migration numbers (0.36 up to 0.64) of PEO. As a result, Li/Li cells with composite electrolyte exhibit superior cyclability for 1000&#160;h at a current density of 0.2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Meanwhile, the solid LiFePO4/Li battery delivers highly reversible capacities of 148.8&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 after 200&#160;cycles. These findings highlight a new approach for anion confinement through the use of functional group electronic effects, leading to enhanced ionic conductivity, and a feasible direction for high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>4D Visualization of a Nonthermal Coherent Magnon in a Laser Heated Lattice by an X&#8208;ray Free Electron Laser</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Femtosecond time&#8208;resolved resonant magnetic X&#8208;ray diffraction experiment using an X&#8208;ray free electron laser visualizes a light&#8208;induced coherent magnon in a multiferroic. The magnon trajectory in time and 3D space unveils the photomagnetic coupling largely enhanced by above&#8208;bandgap photoexcitation, distinguished from a laser&#8208;heated magnetic behavior. This energy&#8208;efficient photoexcitation process suggests the potential for a novel photomagnetic control of ferroelectricity in multiferroics.








Abstract
Ultrafast optical manipulation of magnetic phenomena is an exciting achievement of mankind, expanding one's horizon of knowledge toward the functional nonequilibrium states. The dynamics acting on an extremely short timescale push the detection limits that reveal fascinating light&#8211;matter interactions for nonthermal creation of effective magnetic fields. While some cases are benchmarked by emergent transient behaviors, otherwise identifying the nonthermal effects remains challenging. Here, a femtosecond time&#8208;resolved resonant magnetic X&#8208;ray diffraction experiment is introduced, which uses an X&#8208;ray free&#8208;electron laser (XFEL) to distinguish between the effective field and the photoinduced thermal effect. It is observed that a multiferroic Y&#8208;type hexaferrite exhibits magnetic Bragg peak intensity oscillations manifesting entangled antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) Fourier components of a coherent AFM magnon. The magnon trajectory constructed in 3D space and time domains is decisive to evince ultrafast field formation preceding the lattice thermalization. A remarkable impact of photoexcitation across the electronic bandgap is directly unraveled, amplifying the photomagnetic coupling that is one of the highest among AFM dielectrics. Leveraging the above&#8208;bandgap photoexcitation, this energy&#8208;efficient optical process further suggests a novel photomagnetic control of ferroelectricity in multiferroics.

Abstract
The emerging non&#8208;volatile memory technologies based on ferroic materials are promising for producing high&#8208;speed, low&#8208;power, and high&#8208;density memory in the integrated circuits field. Long&#8208;range ferroic orders observed in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials have triggered extensive research interest in 2D magnets, 2D ferroelectrics, 2D multiferroics and their device applications. Devices based on 2D ferroic materials and heterostructures with an atomically smooth interface and ultrathin thickness have exhibited impressive properties and significant potential for developing advanced non&#8208;volatile memory. In this context, this paper conducts a systematic review of emergent 2D ferroic materials, emphasizing their recent research on non&#8208;volatile memory applications, with a view to proposing brighter prospects for 2D magnetic materials, 2D ferroelectric materials, 2D multiferroic materials and their relevant devices.

         <title>Single Nanoparticle&#8208;Based Nanomachining for Fabrication of Uniform Nanochannel Sensor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The structure of nanomaterials and nanodevices determines their functionality and applications. A single uniform nanochannel with a high aspect ratio is an attractive structure due to its unique rigid structures, easy preparation and diverse pore structures that hold significant promising importance in fields such as nanopore sensing and nanomanufacturing. Although the metal nanoparticle&#8208;assistant silicon etching technique could produce uniform nanochannels, however, the fabrication of single through nanochannel remains a challenge thus far. We develop a simple and versatile strategy that allows for the retention of individual gold nanoparticle on a substrate, enabling single nanoparticle nanomachining. This method involves three steps: the formation of a carbon protective layer on individual nanoparticle via electron&#8208;beam irradiation, selective removal of unprotected nanoparticles using a corrosive agent, and subsequent elimination of the carbon layer. This enables the fabrication of a single submillimeter&#8208;long uniform through nanochannel in the silicon wafer, which can be employed for nanopore sensing and shape&#8208;based nanoparticle distinguishing. The developed method could also facilitate single nanoparticle studies and nanomachining for a broad application in materials science, electronics, micro/nano optics, and catalysis.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Body Biomarker Entrapment System: An All&#8208;Encompassing Tool for Ultrasensitive Disease Diagnosis and Epidemic Screening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ultrasensitive identification of biomarkers in biofluids is essential for precise diagnosis of diseases. For the gold standard approaches, polymerase chain reaction and enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay, cumbersome operational steps hinder their point&#8208;of&#8208;care applications. Here, w e implement a bionic biomarker entrapment system (BioES), which employs a multi&#8208;body Y&#8208;shaped tetrahedral DNA probe immobilized on carbon nanotube transistors. W e successfully realize clinical identification of endometriosis by detecting an estrogen receptor, ER&#946;, from the lesion tissue of endometriosis patients and establish a standard diagnosis procedure. The multi&#8208;body Y&#8208;shaped BioES achieves a theoretical limit of detection (LoD) of 6.74 aM and a LoQ of 141 aM in a complex protein milieu. Furthermore, the BioES is optimized into multi&#8208;site recognition module for enhanced binding efficiency, realizing the first identification of monkeypox virus antigen A35R and unamplified detection of circulating tumor DNA of breast cancer in serum. The rigid and compact probe framework with synergy effect enable the BioES to target A35R and DNA with a LoD down to 991 aM and 0.21 aM, respectively. Owing to its versatility for proteins and nucleic acids as well as ease&#8208;of&#8208;manipulation and ultra&#8208;sensitivity, the BioES can be leveraged as an all&#8208;encompassing tool for population&#8208;wide screening of epidemics and clinical disease diagnosis.

         <title>Synthesis of Zwitterionic CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals with Controlled Anisotropy Using Surface&#8208;Selective Ligand Pairs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Mechanistic studies of the morphology of lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (LHP&#8208;NCs) are hampered by a lack of generalizable suitable synthetic strategies and ligand systems. Here, we present the synthesis of zwitterionic CsPbBr3 NCs with controlled anisotropy using a proposed &#8220;surface&#8208;selective ligand pairs&#8221; strategy. Such strategy provides a platform to systematically study the binding affinity of capping ligand pairs and the resulting LHP morphologies. By using zwitterionic ligands (ZwL) with varying structures, we have obtained majority ZwL&#8208;capped LHP NCs with controlled morphology, including anisotropic nanoplatelets and nanorods, for the first time. Combining experiments with density functional theory calculations, we reveal factors that govern the ligand binding on the different surface facets of LHP&#8208;NCs, including the steric bulkiness of the ligand, the number of binding sites, and the charge distance between binding moieties. Our study provides guidance for the further exploration of anisotropic LHP&#8208;NCs.

         <title>Induction of Tumor Ferroptosis&#8208;Dependent Immunity via an Injectable Attractive Pickering Emulsion Gel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;in&#8208;oil Pickering emulsion gel is developed to deliver RSL&#8208;3, a ferroptosis inducer dissolved in iodized oil, and programmed death&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;1)&#160;antibody, an immune checkpoint inhibitor dissolved in water. RSL&#8208;3 + PD&#8208;1@gel induces ferroptosis of tumor cells through cascade amplification and elicits antitumor immune responses via accumulation of helper T lymphocyte cells and cytotoxic T cells in tumors with low immunogenicity.








Abstract
The combination of ferroptosis inducers and immune checkpoint blockade can enhance antitumor effects. However, the efficacy in tumors with low immunogenicity requires further investigation. In this work, a water&#8208;in&#8208;oil Pickering emulsion gel is developed to deliver (1S, 3R)&#8208;RSL&#8208;3 (RSL&#8208;3), a ferroptosis inducer dissolved in iodized oil, and programmed death&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;1) antibody, the most commonly used immune checkpoint inhibitor dissolved in water, with optimal characteristics (RSL&#8208;3 + PD&#8208;1@gel). Tumor lipase degrades the continuous oil phase, which results in the slow release of RSL&#8208;3&#160;and PD&#8208;1&#160;antibody and a notable antitumor effect against low&#8208;immunogenic hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic cancer. Intriguingly, the RSL&#8208;3 + PD&#8208;1@gel induces ferroptosis of tumor cells, resulting in antitumor immune response via accumulation of helper T lymphocyte cells and cytotoxic T cells. Additionally, the single&#8208;cell sequence profiling analysis during tumor treatment reveals the induction of ferroptosis in tumor cells together with strong antitumor immune response in ascites.

         <title>Synergetic Enhancement of Strength&#8211;Ductility and Thermoelectric Properties of Ag2Te by Domain Boundaries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nanodomain strategy for improving the mechanical and thermoelectric properties of materials simultaneously is presented. Ag2Te with suppressed lattice thermal conductivity and improved strength&#8211;ductility synergy is achieved. These findings provide new insights into grain and domain boundary engineering for high&#8208;performance inorganic semiconductors with robust mechanical strength&#8211;ductility synergy.








Abstract
Simultaneously improving the mechanical and thermoelectric (TE) properties is significant for the engineering applications of inorganic TE materials. In this work, a novel nanodomain strategy is developed for Ag2Te compounds to yield 40% and 200% improved compressive strength (160&#160;MPa) and fracture strain (16%) when compared to domain&#8208;free samples (115&#160;MPa and 5.5%, respectively). The domained samples also achieve a 45% improvement in average ZT value. The domain boundaries (DBs) provide extra sites for dislocation nucleation while pinning the dislocation movement, resulting in superior strength and ductility. In addition, phonon scattering induced by DBs suppresses the lattice thermal conductivity of Ag2Te and also reduces the weighted mobility. These findings provide new insights into grain and DB engineering for high&#8208;performance inorganic semiconductors with robust mechanical properties.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously improving the mechanical and thermoelectric (TE) properties is significant for the engineering applications of inorganic TE materials. In this work, a novel nanodomain strategy is developed for Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te compounds to yield 40% and 200% improved compressive strength (160&#160;MPa) and fracture strain (16%) when compared to domain-free samples (115&#160;MPa and 5.5%, respectively). The domained samples also achieve a 45% improvement in average &lt;i&gt;ZT&lt;/i&gt; value. The domain boundaries (DBs) provide extra sites for dislocation nucleation while pinning the dislocation movement, resulting in superior strength and ductility. In addition, phonon scattering induced by DBs suppresses the lattice thermal conductivity of Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te and also reduces the weighted mobility. These findings provide new insights into grain and DB engineering for high-performance inorganic semiconductors with robust mechanical properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Roll&#8208;to&#8208;Roll Printing of Anomalous Nernst Thermopile for Direct Sensing of Perpendicular Heat Flux</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel circuit design that counteracts the Seebeck effect has enabled the direct sensing of perpendicular heat flux using the anomalous Nernst effect thermopile. This allows for roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll printing of flexible and practical thermoelectric devices, with advantages including mass production, large area coverage, and reduced cost. Its applications are expected to drive future advances in thermal management technology.








Abstract
The anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) converts heat flux perpendicular to the plane into electricity, in sharp contrast with the Seebeck effect (SE), enabling mass production, large area, and flexibility of their devices through ordinary thin&#8208;film fabrication techniques. Heat flux sensors, one of the most promising applications of ANE, are powerful devices for evaluating heat flow and can lead to energy savings through efficient thermal management. In reality, however, SE caused by the in&#8208;plane heat flux is always superimposed on the measurement signal, making it difficult to evaluate the perpendicular heat flux. Here, ANE&#8208;type heat flux sensors that selectively detect a perpendicular heat flux are fabricated by adjusting the net Seebeck coefficient in their thermopile circuit with mass&#8208;producible roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll sputtering methods. The direct sensing of perpendicular heat flux using ANE&#8208;based flexible thermopiles, as well as their simple fabrication process, paves the way for the practical application of thin&#8208;film thermoelectric devices.

         <title>Gate&#8208;Defined Josephson Weak&#8208;Links in Monolayer WTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolayer tungsten ditelluride (WTe2) can be both a quantum spin Hall insulator and gated into a superconducting state. Josephson weak&#8208;links are fabricated using local gates on hBN&#8208;encapsulated WTe2 and the 2D nature of the superconducting leads is demonstrated. The fabrication provides a first step toward realizing versatile all&#8208;in&#8208;one gate configurable topological Josephson weak&#8208;links.








Abstract
Systems combining superconductors with topological insulators offer a platform for the study of Majorana bound states and a possible route to realize fault tolerant topological quantum computation. Among the systems being considered in this field, monolayers of tungsten ditelluride (WTe2) have a rare combination of properties. Notably, it has been demonstrated to be a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) and can easily be gated into a superconducting state. Measurements on gate&#8208;defined Josephson weak&#8208;link devices fabricated using monolayer WTe2 are reported. It is found that consideration of the 2D superconducting leads are critical in the interpretation of magnetic interference in the resulting junctions. The reported fabrication procedures suggest a facile way to produce further devices from this technically challenging material and the results mark the first step toward realizing versatile all&#8208;in&#8208;one topological Josephson weak&#8208;links using monolayer WTe2.

         <title>Direct Conversion of Phase&#8208;Transition Entropy into Electrochemical Thermopower and the Peltier Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermoresponsive polymer having a redox&#8208;active moiety, poly(N&#8208;isopropyl acrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;N&#8208;(2&#8208;acrylamide ethyl)&#8208;N&#8242;&#8208;n&#8208;propylviologen) (PNV), is applied to the electrolyte of thermocell and electrochemical Peltier effect. By undergoing a coil&#8211;globule phase transition, the polymer exhibits a significant entropy change, resulting in a drastic increase in the Seebeck coefficient (Se) of the thermocell.








Abstract
A thermocell generates thermopower from a temperature difference (&#916;T) between two electrodes. The converse process of thermocells is an electrochemical Peltier effect, which creates a &#916;T on the electrodes by applying an external current. The Seebeck coefficient (Se) of the electrochemical system is proportional to the entropy change of the redox reaction; therefore, a redox system having a significant entropy change is expected to increase the Se. In this study, a thermoresponsive polymer having a redox&#8208;active moiety, poly(N&#8208;isopropyl acrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;N&#8208;(2&#8208;acrylamide ethyl)&#8208;N&#8242;&#8208;n&#8208;propylviologen) (PNV), is used as the redox species of a thermocell. PNV2+ dication undergoes the coil&#8211;globule phase transition upon the reduction to PNV+ cation radical, and a large entropy change is introduced because water molecules are freed from the polymer chains. The Se of PNV thermocell drastically increased to +2.1&#160;mV K&#8722;1 at the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of PNV. The entropy change calculated from the increment of Se agrees with the value evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry. Moreover, the electrochemical Peltier effect is observed when the device temperature is increased above the LCST. This study shows that the large entropy change associated with the coil&#8211;globule phase transition can be used in electrochemical thermal management and refrigeration technologies.

         <dc:description>
Lattice&#8208;strain engineering as an innovative strategy for fine tuning the surface electronic configuration of nanomaterials provides a guideline for the development of heterogenous oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysts.








Abstract
The energy efficiency of metal&#8211;air batteries and water&#8208;splitting techniques is severely constrained by multiple electronic transfers in the heterogenous oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the high overpotential induced by the sluggish kinetics has become an uppermost scientific challenge. Numerous attempts are devoted to enabling high activity, selectivity, and stability via tailoring the surface physicochemical properties of nanocatalysts. Lattice&#8208;strain engineering as a cutting&#8208;edge method for tuning the electronic and geometric configuration of metal sites plays a pivotal role in regulating the interaction of catalytic surfaces with adsorbate molecules. By defining the d&#8208;band center as a descriptor of the structure&#8211;activity relationship, the individual contribution of strain effects within state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts can be systematically elucidated in the OER optimization mechanism. In this review, the fundamentals of the OER and the advancements of strain&#8208;catalysts are showcased&#160;and the innovative trigger strategies are enumerated, with particular emphasis on the feedback mechanism between the precise regulation of lattice&#8208;strain and optimal activity. Subsequently, the modulation of electrocatalysts with various attributes is categorized and the impediments encountered in the practicalization of strained effect are discussed, ending with an outlook on future research directions for this burgeoning field.

         <title>Tuning the Coordination Environment of Carbon&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts via Doping with Multiple Heteroatoms and Their Applications in Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regulation of the coordination environment of carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) by doping multi&#8208;heteroatoms and its application in electrochemical reactions are systematically reviewed. The reaction mechanism and structure&#8211;activity relationship of carbon&#8208;based SACs are discussed by combining experimental results and theoretical calculations. Some suggestions are proposed regarding the challenges facing this strategy for the future development of carbon&#8208;based SACs.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are considered to be a perfect platform for studying the structure&#8211;activity relationship of different reactions due to the adjustability of their coordination environment. Multi&#8208;heteroatom doping has been demonstrated as an effective strategy for tuning the coordination environment of carbon&#8208;based SACs and enhancing catalytic performance in electrochemical reactions.

     alt="Tuning the Coordination Environment of Carbon-Based Single-Atom Catalysts via Doping with Multiple Heteroatoms and Their Applications in Electrocatalysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulation of the coordination environment of carbon-based single-atom catalysts (SACs) by doping multi-heteroatoms and its application in electrochemical reactions are systematically reviewed. The reaction mechanism and structure&#8211;activity relationship of carbon-based SACs are discussed by combining experimental results and theoretical calculations. Some suggestions are proposed regarding the challenges facing this strategy for the future development of carbon-based SACs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon-based single-atom catalysts (SACs) are considered to be a perfect platform for studying the structure&#8211;activity relationship of different reactions due to the adjustability of their coordination environment. Multi-heteroatom doping has been demonstrated as an effective strategy for tuning the coordination environment of carbon-based SACs and enhancing catalytic performance in electrochemical reactions. Herein, recently developed strategies for multi-heteroatom doping, focusing on the regulation of single-atom active sites by heteroatoms in different coordination shells, are summarized. In addition, the correlation between the coordination environment and the catalytic activity of carbon-based SACs are investigated through representative experiments and theoretical calculations for various electrochemical reactions. Finally, concerning certain shortcomings of the current strategies of doping multi-heteroatoms, some suggestions are put forward to promote the development of carbon-based SACs in the field of electrocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Personal Thermoregulation by Moisture&#8208;Engineered Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To facilitate the development of moisture&#8208;responsive textiles with real&#8208;life applications, the mechanisms, research status, existing engineering and scientific limitations, and future directions of moisture&#8208;responsive textiles from flap opening and closing, yarn/fiber deformation, and sweat&#8208;evaporation regulation are systematically summarized in three categories, respectively.








Abstract
Personal thermal management can effectively manage the skin microenvironment, improve human comfort, and reduce energy consumption. In personal thermal&#8208;management technology, owing to the high latent heat of water evaporation in wet&#8208;response textiles, heat&#8208; and moisture&#8208;transfer coexist and interact with each other. In the last few years, with rapid advances in materials science and innovative polymers, humidity&#8208;sensitive textiles have been developed for personal thermal management. However, a large gap exists between the conceptual laboratory&#8208;scale design and actual textile. Here, moisture&#8208;responsive textiles based on flap opening and closing, those based on yarn/fiber deformation, and sweat&#8208;evaporation regulation based on textile design for personal thermoregulation are reviewed, and the corresponding mechanisms and research progress are discussed. Finally, the existing engineering and scientific limitations and future developments are considered to resolve the existing issues and accelerate the practical application of moisture&#8208;responsive textiles and related technologies.

Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs), as emerging carbon nanomaterials, have been regarded as promising alternatives for electroluminescent light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) owing to their distinct characteristics, such as low toxicity, tuneable photoluminescence, and good photostability. In the last few years, despite remarkable progress achieved in CD&#8208;based LEDs, their device performance is still inferior to that of well&#8208;developed organic, heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;based QDs, and perovskite LEDs. To better exploit LED applications and boost device performance, in this review, a comprehensive overview of currently explored CDs is presented, focusing on their key optical characteristics, which are closely related to the structural design of CDs from their carbon core to surface modifications, and to macroscopic structural engineering, including the embedding of CDs in the matrix or spatial arrangement of CDs. The design of CD&#8208;based LEDs for display and lighting applications based on the fluorescence, phosphorescence, and delayed fluorescence emission of CDs is also highlighted. Finally, it is concluded with a discussion regarding the key challenges and plausible prospects in this field. It is hoped that this review inspires more extensive research on CDs from a new perspective and promotes practical applications of CD&#8208;based LEDs in multiple directions of current and future research.

         <title>Harvesting Energy from Atmospheric Water: Grand Challenges in Continuous Electricity Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atmospheric water is ubiquitous on Earth and extensively participates in the natural water cycle through evaporation and condensation. This process involves tremendous energy exchange with the environment, which can be harnessed by moisture energy harvesting devices. In this review, this emerging technology is summarized, especially focusing on continuous power generation, from key aspects of mechanisms, materials, and system designs.








Abstract
Atmospheric water is ubiquitous on earth and extensively participates in the natural water cycle through evaporation and condensation. This process involves tremendous energy exchange with the environment, but very little of the energy has so far been harnessed. The recently emerged hydrovoltaic technology, especially moisture&#8208;induced electricity, shows great potential in harvesting energy from atmospheric water and gives birth to moisture energy harvesting devices. The device performance, especially the long&#8208;term operational capacity, has been significantly enhanced over the past few years. Further development; however, requires in&#8208;depth understanding of mechanisms, innovative materials, and ingenious system designs. In this review, beginning with describing the basic properties of water, the key aspects of the water&#8211;hygroscopic material interactions and mechanisms of power generation are discussed. The current material systems and advances in promising material development are then summarized. Aiming at the chief bottlenecks of limited operational time, advanced system designs that are helpful to improve device performance are listed. Especially, the synergistic effect of moisture adsorption and water evaporation on material and system levels to accomplish sustained electricity generation is discussed. Last, the remaining challenges are analyzed and future directions for developing this promising technology are suggested.

         <title>Diatomite&#8208;Templated Synthesis of Single&#8208;Atom Cobalt&#8208;Doped MoS2/Carbon Composites to Boost Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diatomite&#8208;templated synthetic strategy to prepare SA Co&#8208;MoS2/C toward high&#8208;performance sodium storage is developed. Because of the hierarchical structure, high conductivity, and abundant active sites, SA Co&#8208;MoS2/C reveals remarkable specific capacity, high rate performance, and outstanding long cyclic stability. The sodium&#8208;ion full cell composed of SA Co&#8208;MoS2/C anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode demonstrates unexpected stability with the cycle number exceeded 1200.








Abstract
2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are promising electrodes for energy conversion/storage because of the layered structure and maximum atom utilization efficiency. However, the integration of such two type materials and the relevant sodium storage applications remain daunting challenges. Here, an ingenious diatomite&#8208;templated synthetic strategy is designed to fabricate single&#8208;atom cobalt&#8208;doped MoS2/carbon (SA Co&#8208;MoS2/C) composites toward the high&#8208;performance sodium storage. Benefiting from the unique hierarchical structure, high electron/sodium&#8208;ion conductivity, and abundant active sites, the obtained SA Co&#8208;MoS2/C reveals remarkable specific capacity (&#8776;604.0 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1), high rate performance, and outstanding long cyclic stability. Particularly, the sodium&#8208;ion full cell composed of SA Co&#8208;MoS2/C anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode demonstrates unexpected stability with the cycle number exceeded 1200. The internal sodium storage mechanism is clarified with the aid of density functional theory calculations and in situ experimental characterizations. This work not only represents a substantial leap in terms of synthesizing SACs on 2D TMDCs but also provides a crucial step toward the practical sodium&#8208;ion battery applications.

         <title>Magnetically Actuated Fiber&#8208;Based Soft Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D magnetic soft robots are demonstrated through a combination of photocurable magnetic elastomer design and fiber&#8208;based fabrication of helical actuators. Fiber&#8208;based robots are engineered for crawling and walking motion under unidirectional fields applied via stationary electromagnets. The versatile design and straightforward control pave the way for applications of magnetic fiber&#8208;based robots in spatially constrained environments.








Abstract
Broad adoption of magnetic soft robotics is hampered by the sophisticated field paradigms for their manipulation and the complexities in controlling multiple devices. Furthermore, high&#8208;throughput fabrication of such devices across spatial scales remains challenging. Here, advances in fiber&#8208;based actuators and magnetic elastomer composites are leveraged to create 3D magnetic soft robots controlled by unidirectional fields. Thermally drawn elastomeric fibers are instrumented with a magnetic composite synthesized to withstand strains exceeding 600%. A combination of strain and magnetization engineering in these fibers enables programming of 3D robots capable of crawling or walking in magnetic fields orthogonal to the plane of motion. Magnetic robots act as cargo carriers, and multiple robots can be controlled simultaneously and in opposing directions using a single stationary electromagnet.

     alt="Magnetically Actuated Fiber-Based Soft Robots"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3D magnetic soft robots are demonstrated through a combination of photocurable magnetic elastomer design and fiber-based fabrication of helical actuators. Fiber-based robots are engineered for crawling and walking motion under unidirectional fields applied via stationary electromagnets. The versatile design and straightforward control pave the way for applications of magnetic fiber-based robots in spatially constrained environments.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broad adoption of magnetic soft robotics is hampered by the sophisticated field paradigms for their manipulation and the complexities in controlling multiple devices. Furthermore, high-throughput fabrication of such devices across spatial scales remains challenging. Here, advances in fiber-based actuators and magnetic elastomer composites are leveraged to create 3D magnetic soft robots controlled by unidirectional fields. Thermally drawn elastomeric fibers are instrumented with a magnetic composite synthesized to withstand strains exceeding 600%. A combination of strain and magnetization engineering in these fibers enables programming of 3D robots capable of crawling or walking in magnetic fields orthogonal to the plane of motion. Magnetic robots act as cargo carriers, and multiple robots can be controlled simultaneously and in opposing directions using a single stationary electromagnet. The scalable approach to fabrication and control of magnetic soft robots invites their future applications in constrained environments where complex fields cannot be readily deployed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Circulatory Support: Artificial Muscles for the Future of Cardiovascular Assist Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
If the heart fails, mechanical support is required for survival. Artificial muscle actuators are poised to transform the way the heart is supported clinically today. Learning from the challenges in current practice, this article addresses bottlenecks across all actuator types and provides inspiring research perspectives for innovative future technology.








Abstract
Artificial muscles enable the design of soft implantable devices which are poised to transform the way we&#160;mechanically support the heart today. Heart failure is a prevalent and deadly disease, which is treated with the implantation of rotary blood pumps as the only alternative to heart transplantation. The clinically used mechanical devices are associated with severe adverse events, which are reflected here in a comprehensive list of critical requirements for soft active devices of the future: low power, no blood contact, pulsatile support, physiological responsiveness, high cycle life, and less&#8208;invasive implantation. In this review, prior art in artificial muscles for their applicability in the short and long term is investigated and critically evaluated. The main challenges regarding the effectiveness, controllability, and implantability of recently proposed actuators are highlighted and the future perspectives for attachment, physiological responsiveness, durability, and biodegradability as well as equitable design considerations are explored.

         <title>Oxidation of Hydrogen Sulfide to Polysulfide and Thiosulfate by a Carbon Nanozyme: Therapeutic Implications with an Emphasis on Down Syndrome</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidized carbon nanozymes catalytically oxidize hydrogen sulfide to polysulfides and thiosulfate in an oxygen&#8208;dependent manner. In this report the reaction kinetics of polysulfide and thiosulfate formation both in a cell&#8208;free setting and intracellularly and present the possible role of these nanozymes as a supportive therapy in Down Syndrome, a condition where hydrogen sulfide production is detrimentally elevated.








Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a noxious, potentially poisonous, but necessary gas produced from sulfur metabolism in humans. In Down Syndrome (DS), the production of H2S is elevated and associated with degraded mitochondrial function. Therefore, removing H2S from the body as a stable oxide could be an approach to reducing the deleterious effects of H2S in DS. In this report we describe the catalytic oxidation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) to polysulfides (HS2+n&#8722;) and thiosulfate (S2O32&#8722;) by poly(ethylene glycol) hydrophilic carbon clusters (PEG&#8208;HCCs) and poly(ethylene glycol) oxidized activated charcoal (PEG&#8208;OACs), examples of oxidized carbon nanozymes (OCNs). We show that OCNs oxidize H2S to polysulfides and S2O32&#8722; in a dose&#8208;dependent manner. The reaction is dependent on O2 and the presence of quinone groups on the OCNs. In DS donor lymphocytes we found that OCNs increased polysulfide production, proliferation, and afforded protection against additional toxic levels of H2S compared to untreated DS lymphocytes. Finally, in Dp16 and Ts65DN murine models of DS, we found that OCNs restored osteoclast differentiation. This new action suggests potential facile translation into the clinic for conditions involving excess H2S exemplified by DS.

         <title>Efficient Therapy of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) with Highly Specific and Durable Targeted Ta2C Modified with Chondroitin Sulfate (TACS)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TACS keeps stable in gastrointestinal tract and targets the inflammatory lesions efficiently and accurately. TACS has specific CT imaging for IBD and alleviates the five major pathological features of IBD including alleviating oxidative stress, inhibiting apoptosis, anti&#8208;inflammation, restoring barrier function, and modulating the gut microbiome.








Abstract
Non&#8208;invasive localization of lesions and specific targeted therapy are still the main challenges for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Ta, as a medical metal element, has been widely used in the treatment of different diseases because of its excellent physicochemical properties but is still far from being explored in IBD. Here, Ta2C modified with chondroitin sulfate (CS) (TACS) is evaluated as a highly targeted therapy nanomedicine for IBD. Specifically, TACS is modified with dual targeting CS functions due to IBD lesion&#8208;specific positive charges and high expression of CD44 receptors. Thanks to the acid stability, sensitive CT imaging function, and strong reactive oxygen species (ROS) elimination ability, oral TACS can accurately locate and delineate IBD lesions through non&#8208;invasive CT imaging, and specifically targeted treat IBD effectively because high levels of ROS are a central factor in the progression of IBD. As expected, TACS has much better imaging and therapeutic effects than clinical CT contrast agent and first&#8208;line drug 5&#8208;aminosalicylic acid, respectively. The mechanism of TACS treatment mainly involves protection of mitochondria, elimination of oxidative stress, inhibiting macrophage M1 polarization, protection of intestinal barrier, and restoration of intestinal flora balance. Collectively, this work provides unprecedented opportunities for oral nanomedicines to targeted therapy of IBD.

         <title>Liquid Crystals for Advanced Smart Devices with Microwave and Millimeter&#8208;Wave Applications: Recent Progress for Next&#8208;Generation Communications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective focuses on using liquid crystals (LCs) to improve driving performance and add special functions to smart RF devices. Since the design of the RF device itself imposes limits on maximization of performance, it must be considered in the materials domain. The fundamental understanding of LCs for advanced reconfigurable telecommunication devices and key research directions are discussed, suggesting design strategies for LCs in advanced smart RF devices with improved driving performance and functionality.








Abstract
Liquid crystals (LCs) technology have a well&#8208;established history of applications in visible light, particularly in the display industry. However, with the rapid growth in communication technology, LCs have become a topic of current interest for high&#8208;frequency microwave (MW) and millimeter&#8208;wave (mmWave) applications due to promising characteristics such as tunability, continuous tuning, low losses, and price compatibility. To improve the performance of future communication technology using LCs, it is not sufficient only with the perspective of radio&#8208;frequency (RF) technology. Therefore, it is imperative to understand not only the novel structural designs and optimization of MW engineering but also the perspective of materials engineering when implementing advanced RF devices with maximum performance for next&#8208;generation satellite and terrestrial communication. Herein, based on advanced nematic LCs, polymer&#8208;modified LCs, dual&#8208;frequency LCs, and photo&#8208;reactive LCs, this article summarizes and examines the modulation principles and key research directions for the design strategies of LCs for advanced smart RF devices with improved driving performance and novel functionality. Furthermore, the challenges in development of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art smart RF devices that use LCs are discussed.

         <title>Targeted Reprogramming of Vitamin B3 Metabolism as a Nanotherapeutic Strategy towards Chemoresistant Cancers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs) maintain cancer stem cell stemness and promote immunosuppression, leading to chemoresistance and immune escape. Gemini&#8208;like nanoparticles are designed for two&#8208;pronged CAF reprogramming and cancer cell elimination. CAF&#8208;targeting nanoparticles transform CAFs into quiescent fibroblasts via a cascade of Vitamin B3 metabolic reprogramming and chromatin remodeling and thereby rehabilitate chemosensitivity and immune activation in chemoresistant breast, liver, pancreatic and colorectal cancers.








Abstract
Cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promote cancer stem cell (CSC)&#8208;mediated chemoresistance and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. However, direct depletion of CAFs may increase cancer invasiveness and metastasis. As a generalized strategy against chemoresistant cancers, Gemini&#8208;like homotypic targeting nanoparticles (NPs) are designed for two&#8208;pronged CAF transformation and cancer cell elimination.

&lt;p&gt;Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) maintain cancer stem cell stemness and promote immunosuppression, leading to chemoresistance and immune escape. Gemini-like nanoparticles are designed for two-pronged CAF reprogramming and cancer cell elimination. CAF-targeting nanoparticles transform CAFs into quiescent fibroblasts via a cascade of Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; metabolic reprogramming and chromatin remodeling and thereby rehabilitate chemosensitivity and immune activation in chemoresistant breast, liver, pancreatic and colorectal cancers.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promote cancer stem cell (CSC)-mediated chemoresistance and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. However, direct depletion of CAFs may increase cancer invasiveness and metastasis. As a generalized strategy against chemoresistant cancers, Gemini-like homotypic targeting nanoparticles (NPs) are designed for two-pronged CAF transformation and cancer cell elimination. The CAF-targeted NPs couple vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; metabolic reprogramming to epigenetic modulation of secreted pro-stemness and immunosuppressive factors, thereby diminishing CSC and suppressive immune cell populations to enhance cancer cell drug susceptibility and cytotoxic T cell infiltration. In mouse models of breast, liver, pancreatic and colorectal cancers that are resistant to their respective first-line chemotherapeutics, a single dose of hydrogel co-delivering the Gemini-like NPs can rehabilitate chemosensitivity, induce immune activation, and achieve tumor regression. Moreover, it stimulates robust T cell memory for long-term protection against tumor rechallenge. This study thus represents an innovative approach with broad applicability for overcoming cancer chemoresistance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exchange&#8208;Interaction&#8208;Like Behavior in Ferroelectric Bilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interlayer lattice and polarization coupling are explored for bilayers of in&#8208;plane&#8208;polarized ferroelectric Pb1&#8722;xSrxTiO3. The cross&#8208;interface coupling can induce effects analogous to exchange bias in magnetism in the form of shifted hysteresis loops. In turn, such effects can be controlled via film thickness and chemistry to produce exotic effects including multistate polarization, exchange&#8208;spring&#8208;like function, and both coercivity softening and hardening.








Abstract
Interlayer coupling in materials, such as exchange interactions at the interface between an antiferromagnet and a ferromagnet, can produce exotic phenomena not present in the parent materials. While such interfacial coupling in magnetic systems is widely studied, there is considerably less work on analogous electric counterparts (i.e., akin to electric &#8220;exchange&#8208;bias&#8208;like&#8221; or &#8220;exchange&#8208;spring&#8208;like&#8221; interactions between two polar materials) despite the likelihood that such effects can also engender new features associated with anisotropic electric dipole alignment. Here, electric analogs of such exchange interactions are reported, and their physical origins are explained for bilayers of in&#8208;plane polarized Pb1&#8722;xSrxTiO3 ferroelectrics. Variation of the strontium content and thickness of the layers provides for deterministic control over the switching properties of the bilayer system resulting in phenomena analogous to an exchange&#8208;spring interaction and, leveraging added control of these interactions with an electric field, the ability to realize multistate&#8208;memory function. Such observations not only hold technological promise for ferroelectrics and multiferroics but also extend the similarities between ferromagnetic and ferroelectric materials to include the manifestation of exchange&#8208;interaction&#8208;like phenomena.

         <title>Inhalable Capsular Polysaccharide&#8208;Camouflaged Gallium&#8208;Polyphenol Nanoparticles Enhance Lung Cancer Chemotherapy by Depleting Local Lung Microbiota</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inhalable capsular polysaccharide (CP)&#8208;camouflaged gallium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic network (MON) is designed here to abrogate bacteria&#8208;induced drug resistance. In multiple lung cancer mice models, inhaled MON shows uniform biodistribution and long&#8208;term retention within lung tissues, and Ga3+ releases effectively disrupted bacterial iron respiration to deplete lung microbiota for enhanced lung cancer chemotherapy.








Abstract
Local lung microbiota is closely associated with lung tumorigenesis and therapeutic response. It is found that lung commensal microbes induce chemoresistance in lung cancer by directly inactivating therapeutic drugs via biotransformation. Accordingly, an inhalable microbial capsular polysaccharide (CP)&#8208;camouflaged gallium&#8208;polyphenol metal&#8211;organic network (MON) is designed to eliminate lung microbiota and thereby abrogate microbe&#8208;induced chemoresistance. As a substitute for iron uptake, Ga3+ released from MON acts as a &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; to disrupt bacterial iron respiration, effectively inactivating multiple microbes. Moreover, CP cloaks endow MON with reduced immune clearance by masquerading as normal host&#8208;tissue molecules, significantly increasing residence time in lung tissue for enhanced antimicrobial efficacy. In multiple lung cancer mice models, microbe&#8208;induced drug degradation is remarkably inhibited when drugs are delivered by antimicrobial MON. Tumor growth is sufficiently suppressed and mouse survival is prolonged. The&#160;work develops a novel microbiota&#8208;depleted nanostrategy to overcome chemoresistance in lung cancer by inhibiting local microbial inactivation of therapeutic drugs.

         <title>Combining PEDOT:PSS Polymer Coating with Metallic 3D Nanowires Electrodes to Achieve High Electrochemical Performances for Neuronal Interfacing Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of a meticulously controlled, highly selective electrodeposited PEDOT:PSS layer onto 3D nanowire electrodes has yielded notable improvements in electrochemical performance. Specifically, this nanoscale&#8208;controlled coating has significantly reduced the interface impedance and enhanced the stimulation capability in comparison to interfaces coated with metallic materials.








Abstract
This study presents a novel approach to improve the performance of microelectrode arrays (MEAs) used for electrophysiological studies of neuronal networks. The integration of 3D nanowires (NWs) with MEAs increases the surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio, which enables subcellular interactions and high&#8208;resolution neuronal signal recording. However, these devices suffer from high initial interface impedance and limited charge transfer capacity due to their small effective area. To overcome these limitations, the integration of conductive polymer coatings, poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene)&#8208;poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is investigated as a mean of improving the charge transfer capacity and biocompatibility of MEAs. The study combines platinum silicide&#8208;based metallic 3D nanowires electrodes with electrodeposited PEDOT:PSS coatings to deposit ultra&#8208;thin (&lt;50 nm) layers of conductive polymer onto metallic electrodes with very high selectivity. The polymer&#8208;coated electrodes&#160;were&#160;fully characterized electrochemically and morphologically to establish a direct relationship between synthesis conditions, morphology, and conductive features. Results show that PEDOT&#8208;coated electrodes exhibit thickness&#8208;dependent improved stimulation and recording performances, offering new perspectives for neuronal interfacing with optimal cell engulfment to enable the study of neuronal activity with acute spatial and signal resolution at the sub&#8208;cellular level.

         <title>Coaxial Nanowire Electrodes Enable Exceptional Fuel Cell Durability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel catalyst/electrode architecture based on a vertically aligned array of ionomer nanowires encapsulated by Pt nanofilms is presented. The resulting coaxial nanowire electrode uses durable Pt nanofilms in place of conventional Pt/C catalysts. This design eliminates the corrosion&#8208;prone carbon supports and ionomer thin films, providing enhanced durability and performance.








Abstract
Polymer&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) hold great promise for applications in clean energy conversion, but cost and durability continue to limit commercialization. This work presents a new class of catalyst/electrode architecture that does not rely on Pt particles or carbon supports, eliminating the primary degradation mechanisms in conventional electrodes, and thereby enabling transformative durability improvements. The coaxial nanowire electrode (CANE) architecture consists of an array of vertically aligned nanowires, each comprising an ionomer core encapsulated by a nanoscale Pt film. This unique design eliminates the triple&#8208;phase boundary and replaces it with two double&#8208;phase boundaries, increasing Pt utilization. It also eliminates the need for carbon support and ionomer binder, enabling improved durability and faster mass transport. Fuel cell membrane electrode assemblies based on CANEs demonstrate extraordinary durability in accelerated stress tests (ASTs), with only 2% and 5% loss in performance after 5000 support AST cycles and 30000 catalysts AST cycles, respectively. The high power density and extremely high durability provided by CANEs can enable a paradigm shift from random electrodes based on unstable platinum nanoparticles dispersed on carbon to ordered electrodes based on durable Pt nanofilms, facilitating rapid deployment of fuel cells in transportation and other clean energy applications.

The D&#8208;matrix chirality enhances cell density, viability, proliferation, and survival of neural cells by attenuating the interaction between cytoskeleton proteins and matrixes, subsequently activating JNK and p38/MAPK signaling pathways, while the proliferation and adhesion of non&#8208;neural cells are promoted on the L&#8208;matrix, which provides a specific method to universally manipulate neural cell behaviors with chiral biomaterial systems.








Abstract
Manipulating neural cell behaviors is a critical issue to various therapies for neurological diseases and damages, where matrix chirality has long been overlooked despite the proven adhesion and proliferation improvement of multiple non&#8208;neural cells by L&#8208;matrixes. Here, it is reported that the D&#8208;matrix chirality specifically enhances cell density, viability, proliferation, and survival in four different types of neural cells, contrasting its inhibition in non&#8208;neural cells. This universal impact on neural cells is defined as &#8220;chirality selection for D&#8208;matrix&#8221; and is achieved through the activation of JNK and p38/MAPK signaling pathways by the cellular tension relaxation resulting from the weak interaction between D&#8208;matrix and cytoskeleton proteins, particularly actin. Also, D&#8208;matrix promotes sciatic nerve repair effectively, both with or without non&#8208;neural stem cell implantation, by improving the population, function, and myelination of autologous Schwann cells. D&#8208;matrix chirality, as a simple, safe, and effective microenvironment cue to specifically and universally manipulate neural cell behaviors, holds extensive application potential in addressing neurological issues such as nerve regeneration, neurodegenerative disease treatment, neural tumor targeting, and neurodevelopment.

         <title>Engineering the Structural Uniformity of Gel Polymer Electrolytes via Pattern&#8208;Guided Alignment for Durable, Safe Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin gel polymer electrolyte (P&#8208;PPL) with patterned structure and superior mechanical toughness (&#8776;613%) for durable and safe solid&#8208;state lithium metal battery is developed. The special patterned structure enables rapid ionic transfer kinetics and uniform Li+ flux. The solid&#8208;state LiFePO4||P&#8208;PPL||Li batteries exhibit excellent cycling stability, high rate capacity as well as high safety.








Abstract
Ultrathin and super&#8208;toughness gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) are the key enabling technology for durable, safe, and high&#8208;energy density solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) but extremely challenging. However, GPEs with limited uniformity and continuity exhibit an uneven Li+ flux distribution, leading to nonuniform deposition. Herein, a fiber patterning strategy for developing and engineering ultrathin (16&#160;&#181;m) fibrous GPEs with high ionic conductivity (&#8776;0.4 mS cm&#8722;1) and superior mechanical toughness (&#8776;613%) for durable and safe SSLMBs is proposed. The special patterned structure provides fast Li+ transport channels and tailoring solvation structure of traditional LiPF6&#8208;based carbonate electrolyte, enabling rapid ionic transfer kinetics and uniform Li+ flux, and boosting stability against Li anodes, thus realizing ultralong Li plating/stripping in the symmetrical cell over 3000&#160;h at 1.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 1.0 mAh cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the SSLMBs with high LiFePO4 loading of 10.58&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 deliver ultralong stable cycling life over 1570 cycles at 1.0 C with 92.5% capacity retention and excellent rate capacity of 129.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5.0 C with a cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.2&#160;V (100% depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge). Patterned GPEs systems are powerful strategies for producing durable and safe SSLMBs.

         <title>Toughening CO2&#8208;Derived Copolymer Elastomers Through Ionomer Networking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation and properties of CO2&#8208;derived block polymer thermoplastic elastomers and ionomers, with Na(I), Mg(II), Ca(II), Zn(II) and Al(III) (&lt;1&#160;wt% metal), are reported. The materials show wide operating temperatures, &gt;50&#8208;fold higher Young's modulus and 21&#8208;times greater tensile strength than unfunctionalized materials, high elastic recovery, and creep&#8208;resistance, and are recyclable.








Abstract
Utilizing carbon dioxide (CO2) to make polycarbonates through the ring&#8208;opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of CO2 and epoxides valorizes and recycles CO2 and reduces pollution in polymer manufacturing. Recent developments in catalysis provide access to polycarbonates with well&#8208;defined structures and allow for copolymerization with biomass&#8208;derived monomers; however, the resulting material properties are underinvestigated. Here, new types of CO2&#8208;derived thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) are described together with a generally applicable method to augment tensile mechanical strength and Young's modulus without requiring material re&#8208;design. These TPEs combine high glass transition temperature (Tg) amorphous blocks comprising CO2&#8208;derived poly(carbonates) (A&#8208;block), with low Tg poly(&#949;&#8208;decalactone), from castor oil, (B&#8208;block) in ABA structures. The poly(carbonate) blocks are selectively functionalized with metal&#8208;carboxylates where the metals are Na(I), Mg(II), Ca(II), Zn(II) and Al(III). The colorless polymers, featuring &lt;1&#160;wt% metal, show tunable thermal (Tg), and mechanical (elongation at break, elasticity, creep&#8208;resistance) properties. The best elastomers show &gt;50&#8208;fold higher Young's modulus and 21&#8208;times greater tensile strength, without compromise to elastic recovery, compared with the starting block polymers. They have wide operating temperatures (&#8722;20 to 200&#160;&#176;C), high creep&#8208;resistance and yet remain recyclable. In the future, these materials may substitute high&#8208;volume petrochemical elastomers and be utilized in high&#8208;growth fields like medicine, robotics, and electronics.

         <title>Growth of Two&#8208;Dimensional Cr2O3&#8208;CrN Mosaic Heterostructures with Tunable Room&#8208;Temperature Ferromagnetism</title>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) magnets have generated much attention due to their potential for spintronic devices. Heterostructures of 2D magnets are interesting platforms for exploring physical phenomena and applications. However, the controlled growth of 2D room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic heterostructures is challenging. Here, we report one&#8208;pot chemical vapor deposition growth of stable 2D Cr2O3&#8208;CrN mosaic heterostructures (MHs) with a controlled ratio of components that possess robust room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism. The 2D MHs consist of Cr2O3 flakes with embedded CrN subdomains and the CrN: Cr2O3 ratio can be tuned from 0% to 100% during growth. By changing the CrN: Cr2O3 ratio, the ferromagnetism of the MHs (e.g., saturation magnetization, coercive field), which originates from the interfacial coupling between Cr2O3 and CrN, can be controlled. Importantly, the obtained Cr2O3&#8208;CrN MHs are stable in air at elevated temperatures and have robust ferromagnetism with Curie temperature &gt;400 K. This work presents a facile method for fabricating 2D MHs with tunable magnetism which will benefit high temperature spintronics.

         <title>Precise Engineering of a Se/Te Nanochaperone for Reinvigorating Cancer Radio&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and universal method for synthesizing nano&#8208;heterojunctions (NHJs) with well&#8208;controlled structure is reported. Dumbbell&#8208;shaped TeSe NHJs effectively facilitate radiotherapy by directly damaging tumor cells and shaping the tumor immuno&#8208;microenvironment, which endows&#160;combination treatment with great abscopal effects to combat distant tumor progression.








Abstract
Facilely synthesized nanoradiosensitizers with well&#8208;controlled structure and multifunctionality are greatly desired to address the challenges of cancer radiotherapy. In this work, a universal method is developed for synthesizing chalcogen&#8208;based TeSe nano&#8208;heterojunctions (NHJs) with rod&#8208;, spindle&#8208;, or dumbbell&#8208;like morphologies by engineering the surfactant and added selenite. Interestingly, dumbbell&#8208;shaped TeSe NHJs (TeSe NDs) as chaperone exhibit better radio&#8208;sensitizing activities than the other two nanostructural shapes. Meanwhile, TeSe NDs can serve as cytotoxic chemodrugs that degrade to highly toxic metabolites in acidic environment and deplete GSH within tumor to facilitate radiotherapy. More importantly, the combination of TeSe NDs with radiotherapy significantly decreases regulatory T cells and M2&#8208;phenotype tumor&#8208;associated macrophage infiltrations within tumors to reshape the immunosuppressive microenvironment and induce robust T lymphocytes&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity, resulting in great abscopal effects on combating distant tumor progression. This study provides a universal method for preparing NHJ with well&#8208;controlled structure and developing nanoradiosensitizers to overcome the clinical challenges of cancer radiotherapy.

&lt;p&gt;Facilely synthesized nanoradiosensitizers with well-controlled structure and multifunctionality are greatly desired to address the challenges of cancer radiotherapy. In this work, a universal method is developed for synthesizing chalcogen-based TeSe nano-heterojunctions (NHJs) with rod-, spindle-, or dumbbell-like morphologies by engineering the surfactant and added selenite. Interestingly, dumbbell-shaped TeSe NHJs (TeSe NDs) as chaperone exhibit better radio-sensitizing activities than the other two nanostructural shapes. Meanwhile, TeSe NDs can serve as cytotoxic chemodrugs that degrade to highly toxic metabolites in acidic environment and deplete GSH within tumor to facilitate radiotherapy. More importantly, the combination of TeSe NDs with radiotherapy significantly decreases regulatory T cells and M2-phenotype tumor-associated macrophage infiltrations within tumors to reshape the immunosuppressive microenvironment and induce robust T lymphocytes-mediated antitumor immunity, resulting in great abscopal effects on combating distant tumor progression. This study provides a universal method for preparing NHJ with well-controlled structure and developing nanoradiosensitizers to overcome the clinical challenges of cancer radiotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spatially&#8208;Encoding Hydrogels With DNA to Control Cell Signaling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the synthesis and photopatterning of hydrogels with multiple, discrete DNA domains, single&#8208;micron resolution spatial control is achieved over chemical composition and function. DNA's sequence specificity is used to reversibly tether DNA and direct protein attachment in patterned domains. Importantly, it is shown that reporter cells preferentially activate in regions of patterned hydrogels containing biomolecular signals.








Abstract
Patterning biomolecules in synthetic hydrogels offers routes to visualize and learn how spatially&#8208;encoded cues modulate cell behavior (e.g., proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis). However, investigating the role of multiple, spatially defined biochemical cues within a single hydrogel matrix remains challenging because of the limited number of orthogonal bioconjugation reactions available for patterning. Herein, a method to pattern multiple oligonucleotide sequences in hydrogels using thiol&#8208;yne photochemistry is introduced. Rapid hydrogel photopatterning of hydrogels with micron resolution DNA features (&#8776;1.5&#160;&#181;m) and control over DNA density are achieved over centimeter&#8208;scale areas using mask&#8208;free digital photolithography. Sequence&#8208;specific DNA interactions are then used to reversibly tether biomolecules to patterned regions, demonstrating chemical control over individual patterned domains. Last, localized cell signaling is shown using patterned protein&#8211;DNA conjugates to selectively activate cells on patterned areas. Overall, this work introduces a synthetic method to achieve multiplexed micron resolution patterns of biomolecules onto hydrogel scaffolds, providing a platform to study complex spatially&#8208;encoded cellular signaling environments.

         <title>Asymmetric Directional Control of Thermal Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Control over the directionality of thermal emission plays a fundamental role in efficient heat transport. Although nanophotonic technologies have demonstrated the capability for angular&#8208;selective thermal emission, achieving asymmetric directional thermal emission in reciprocal systems with energy directed to a single output angle remains challenging due to symmetric band dispersion. In this work, we&#160;present a general strategy for achieving asymmetric directional thermal emission in reciprocal systems. With periodic perturbation and broken mirror symmetry, metasurfaces behave as resonant metagratings whose resonances can be diffracted to symmetric output angles with distinct efficiency, allowing for high emissivity towards a single direction. The asymmetric directional thermal emitter is experimentally demonstrated at mid&#8208;infrared wavelengths with high emissivity (&#949; = 0.61) at the observation angle of +30&#176;, and low emissivity (&#949;&lt;0.3) at other angles. This work highlights the potential for manipulating the directionality of thermal emission, which holds promise for developing ultrathin customized thermal sources and impacts on various thermal&#8208;engineering applications.

         <title>Recent Progress of Supramolecular Chemotherapy Based on Host&#8211;Guest Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Chemotherapy is widely recognized as an effective approach for treating cancer due to its ability to eliminate cancer cells using chemotherapeutic drugs. However, traditional chemotherapy suffers from various drawbacks, including limited solubility and stability of drugs, severe side effects, low bioavailability, drug resistance, and challenges in tracking treatment efficacy. These limitations greatly hinder its widespread clinical application. In contrast, supramolecular chemotherapy, which relies host&#8211;guest interactions, presents a promising alternative by offering highly efficient and minimally toxic anticancer drug delivery. In this review, we provide an overview of recent advancements in supramolecular chemotherapy based on host&#8211;guest interactions. We emphasize the significant role it plays in guiding cancer therapy. Drawing on a wealth of cutting&#8208;edge research, we aim to present a timely and valuable resource for individuals interested in the field of supramolecular chemotherapy or cancer therapy. Furthermore, we aspire to contribute to progression of the field of supramolecular chemotherapy toward clinical application.

         <title>Mitochondrion&#8208;Inspired Magnesium&#8208;Oxygen Biobattery With High Energy Density in Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Implantable batteries are urgently needed as a power source to meet the demands of the next generation of biomedical electronic devices. However, existing implantable batteries suffer from unsatisfactory energy densities, hindering the miniaturization of these devices. Here, we report on a mitochondrion&#8208;inspired magnesium&#8208;oxygen biobattery that achieves both high energy density and biocompatibility in vivo. The resulting biobattery exhibits a recorded energy density of 2517 Wh&#183;L&#8211;1/1491 Wh&#183;kg&#8211;1 based on the total volume/mass of the device in vivo, which is &#8764;2.5 times higher than the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, and can adapt to different environments for stable discharges. The volume of the magnesium&#8208;oxygen biobattery can be as thin as 0.015 mm3 and can be scaled up to 400 times larger without reducing the energy density. Additionally, it shows a stable biobattery/tissue interface, significantly reducing foreign body reactions. This work presents an effective strategy for the development of high&#8208;performance implantable batteries.

Abstract
Electronically controlled droplet manipulation has widespread applications in biochemistry, life sciences and industry. However, current technologies such as electrowetting, electrostatics, and surface charge printing rely on complex electrode arrays and external power supplies, leading to inefficient manipulation. In light of these limitations, w e propose a novel method that leverages tribo&#8208;electrophoresis (TEP) to pipette in an oil medium, thereby enabling human&#8208;droplet interactions to be constructed with greater efficiency. O ur approach involves in the rational design of a triboelectric nanogenerator&#8208;electrostatic tweezer that generates an electric field to charge the droplet and improves the maneuverability of the charged droplet, including aligned/non&#8208;aligned pipetting, stable transport in clamped state, which can be accomplished solely by hand motion. The TEP method not only provides droplets with the freedom to move in three dimensions, but also offers a feasibility case for chemical reactions in the liquid phase and non&#8208;invasive sample extraction. This breakthrough establishes a cornerstone for human&#8208;droplet interactions capitalized on triboelectric nanogenerators, opening new avenues for research in droplet manipulation.

         <title>Mdm2 Targeting Reassembly Peptide (Trap) Nanoparticles For P53 Based Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Gene mutations and functional inhibition are the major obstacles for p53&#8208;mediated oncotherapy. For p53&#8208;wild type tumors, the underlying mechanisms of functional inhibition of p53 during oncogenesis are unknown. Our results revealed that the expression of the MDM2 inhibitor ARF was inhibited in p53&#8208;wild type tumors, indicating that the restoration of ARF could be a potential oncotherapy strategy for p53&#8208;wild type tumors. Therefore, we developed ARF&#8208;mimetic MDM2&#8208;targeting reassembly peptide nanoparticles (MtrapNPs) for p53&#8208;based tumor therapy. Our results elucidated that the MtrapNPs responded to and formed a nanofiber structure with MDM2. By trapping MDM2, the MtrapNPs stabilized and activated p53 for the inhibition of p53&#8208;wild type tumors. In most cases, reactivated mutant p53 is inhibited and degraded by MDM2. In the present study, MtrapNPs were used to load and deliver arsenic trioxide, a p53 mutation rescuer, for p53&#8208;mutated tumor treatment in both orthotopic and metastatic models, and they exhibited significant therapeutic effects. Therefore, our study provides evidence supporting a link between decreased ARF expression and tumor development in patients with p53&#8208;wild type tumors. Thus, the novel MDM2&#8208;trap strategy, which addresses both the inhibition and mutations of p53, is an efficient strategy for the treatment of p53&#8208;mutated tumors.

By trapping MDM2, the MtrapNPs stabilized and activated p53 for the inhibition of p53-wild type tumors. In most cases, reactivated mutant p53 is inhibited and degraded by MDM2. In the present study, MtrapNPs were used to load and deliver arsenic trioxide, a p53 mutation rescuer, for p53-mutated tumor treatment in both orthotopic and metastatic models, and they exhibited significant therapeutic effects. Therefore, our study provides evidence supporting a link between decreased ARF expression and tumor development in patients with p53-wild type tumors. Thus, the novel MDM2-trap strategy, which addresses both the inhibition and mutations of p53, is an efficient strategy for the treatment of p53-mutated tumors.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
Rechargeable batteries are of great significance for alleviating the growing energy crisis by providing efficient and sustainable energy storage solution. However, the multiple issues associated with the diverse components in a battery system as well as the interphase problems greatly hinder their applications. Proteins and its subunits, peptides and amino acids, are versatile biomolecules. Functional groups in different amino acids endow these biomolecules with unique properties including the self&#8208;assembly, ion conducting, antioxidation, great affinity to exterior species, etc. Besides, protein and its subunit materials can not only work in solid forms, but also in liquid forms when dissolved in solutions, making them more versatile to realize materials engineering via diverse approaches. In this review, we aim to offer a comprehensive understanding about the properties of proteins and its subunits, and research progress of using these versatile biomolecules to address the engineering issues of various rechargeable batteries, including alkali&#8208;ion batteries, lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, metal&#8208;air batteries, and flow batteries. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances in electrode, electrolyte, separator, binder, catalyst, interphase modification, as well as recycle of rechargeable batteries are involved, and the impacts of biomolecules on electrochemical properties are particularly emphasized. Finally, perspectives on this interesting field are also provided.

         <title>Boosting The Electrochemical 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Oxidation by Balancing The Competitive Adsorption of Organic And OH&#8722; Over Controllable Reconstructed Ni3S2/NiOx</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The electrocatalytic oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is a promising method for the efficient production of biomass&#8208;derived high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals. However, its practical application is limited by 1) low activity and selectivity caused by the competitive adsorption of HMF and OH&#8722; and 2) low operational stability caused by the uncontrollable reconstruction of the catalyst. To overcome these limitations, a series of Ni3S2/NiOx&#8208;n catalysts with controllable compositions and well&#8208;defined structures were synthesized using a novel in&#8208;situ controlled surface reconstruction strategy. The adsorption behavior of HMF and OH&#8722; could be continuously adjusted by varying the ratio of NiOx to Ni3S2 on the catalysts surface, as indicated by in&#8208;situ characterizations, contact angle analysis and theoretical simulations. Owing to the balanced competitive adsorption of HMF and OH&#8722;, the optimized Ni3S2/NiOx&#8208;15 catalyst exhibited remarkable HMF electrocatalytic oxidation performance, with the current density reaching 366&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.5 VRHE and the Faradaic efficiency of the product, 2,5&#8208;furanedicarboxylic acid, reaching 98%. Moreover, Ni3S2/NiOx&#8208;15 exhibited excellent durability, with its activity and structure remaining stable for over 100&#160;h of operation. This study provides a new route for the design and construction of catalysts for value&#8208;added biomass conversion and offers new insights into enhancing catalytic performance by balancing competitive adsorption.

         <title>Enhancing Oxygen Evolution Reaction Performance in Prussian Blue Analogues: Triple&#8208;Play of Metal Exsolution, Hollow Interiors, And Anionic Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are promising catalysts for green hydrogen production. However, the rational design of high&#8208;performing PBAs is challenging, which requires an in&#8208;depth understanding of catalytic mechanism. Here FeMn@CoNi core&#8208;shell PBAs were employed as precursors, together with Se powders, in low&#8208;temperature pyrolysis in an argon atmosphere. This synthesis method enabled the partial dissociation of inner FeMn PBAs that resulted in hollow interiors, Ni nanoparticles (NPs) exsolution to the surface, and Se incorporation onto the PBA shell. The resulting material presented ultra&#8208;low oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential (184&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and low Tafel slope (43.4&#160;mV dec&#8722;1), outperforming leading&#8208;edge PBA&#8208;based electrocatalysts. The mechanism responsible for such a high OER activity was revealed, assisted by DFT calculations and the surface examination before and after the OER process.&#160;The exsolved Ni NPs were found to help turn the PBAs into Se&#8208;doped core&#8208;shell metal oxyhydroxides during the OER, in which the heterojunction with Ni and the Se incorporation were combined to improve the OER kinetics. This work shows that efficient OER catalysts could be developed by using a novel synthesis method backed up by a sound understanding and control of the catalytic pathway.

         <title>Patterning Complex Line Motifs in Thin Films Using Immersion Controlled Reaction&#8208;Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The discovery of self&#8208;organization principles that enable scalable routes towards complex functional materials has proven to be a persistent challenge. Here reaction&#8208;diffusion driven, immersion controlled patterning (R&#8208;DIP) is introduced, a self&#8208;organization strategy using immersion controlled reaction&#8208;diffusion for targeted line patterning in thin films. By modulating immersion speeds, the movement of a reaction&#8208;diffusion front over gel films is controlled, which induces precipitation of highly uniform lines at the reaction front. A balance between the immersion speed and diffusion provides both hands&#8208;on tunability of the line spacing (d = 10 &#8722; 300&#8201;&#181;m) as well as error&#8208;correction against defects. This immersion&#8208;driven patterning strategy is widely applicable, which is demonstrated by producing line patterns of silver/silver oxide nanoparticles, silver chromate, silver dichromate, and lead carbonate. Through combinatorial stacking of different line patterns, hybrid materials with multi&#8208;dimensional patterns such as square&#8208;, diamond&#8208;, rectangle&#8208; and triangle&#8208;shaped motifs are fabricated. The functionality potential and scalability is demonstrated by producing both wafer&#8208;scale diffraction gratings with user&#8208;defined features as well as an opto&#8208;mechanical sensor based on Moir&#233;&#160;patterning.

         <title>Rational Design of N&#8208;doped Carbon Coated Cobalt Nanoparticles for Highly Efficient and Durable Photothermal CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The photothermal CO2 hydrogenation to high value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels is an appealing approach to alleviate the energy and environmental concerns. However, it still relies on the development of earth&#8208;abundant, efficient and durable catalysts. Here, we report the design of N&#8208;doped carbon coated Co nanoparticles (NPs) as a photothermal catalyst, synthesized through a two&#8208;step pyrolysis of Co&#8208;based ZIF&#8208;67 precursor. Consequently, the catalyst exhibits remarkable activity and stability for photothermal CO2 hydrogenation to CO with a 0.75&#160;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 CO production rate under the full spectrum of light illumination. The high activity and durability of this Co NPs are mainly attributed to the synergy of the attuned size of Co NPs, the thickness of carbon layers and the N doping species. Impressively, the experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations show that such a simple N&#8208;doped carbon coating strategy can effectively facilitate the desorption of generated CO and activation of reactants due to the strong photothermal effect. This work provides a simple and efficient route for the preparation of highly active and durable nonprecious metal catalysts for promising photothermal catalytic reactions.

Abstract
The integration of microorganisms and engineered artificial components has shown considerable promise for creating biohybrid microrobots. The unique features of microalgae make them attractive candidates as natural actuation materials for the design of biohybrid microrobotic systems. In this review, w e will introduce microalgae&#8208;based biohybrid microrobots for diverse biomedical and environmental applications. W e will describe first the distinct propulsion and phototaxis behaviors of green microalgae as well as important properties from other photosynthetic microalga systems (blue&#8208;green algae and diatom) that are crucial to constructing powerful biohybrid microrobots. W e then focus on chemical and physical routes for functionalizing the algae surface with diverse reactive materials towards the fabrication of advanced biohybrid microalgae robots. Finally, w e present representative applications of such algae&#8208;driven microrobots, including drug delivery, imaging, and water decontamination, highlighting the distinct advantages of these active biohybrid robots, along with future prospects and challenges.

         <title>Spidroin&#8208;Inspired Hierarchical Structure Binder Achieves Highly Integrated Silicon&#8208;Based Electrodes</title>

Abstract
As a promising component for next&#8208;generation high energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries, silicon&#8208;based electrode has attracted increasing attention by virtue of ultrahigh theoretical specific capacities. Nevertheless, fast capacity fade posed by tremendous silicon&#8208;based electrode volume changes during cycling remains a huge challenge before large&#8208;scale applications. Herein we develop an aqueous&#8208;oil binary solution based blend (AOB) binder characterized by a spidroin&#8208;like hierarchical structure for tolerating huge volume change of silicon&#8208;based electrodes. In AOB binder, the hydrophobic tetrazole groups&#8208;containing polymer (donate as PPB) and water&#8208;soluble amorphous poly(acrylic acid) mimicks the &#946;&#8208;sheet and &#945;&#8208;helix structure of spidroin, respectively. Benefitted by such biomimetic design, AOB binder enables both high tensile strength and elasticity, and strong electrode adhesion, therefore apparently stabilizing silicon&#8208;based electrode structure and rendering prolonged electrode cycle life. Such a strategy endows a 3.3 Ah soft package cells assembled with Si/C composite anode and NCM811 cathode with a discharge specific capacity of 2.92 Ah after 700 cycles. This work marks a milestone in developing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art silicon&#8208;based electrodes towards high energy density lithium battery applications.

Nevertheless, fast capacity fade posed by tremendous silicon-based electrode volume changes during cycling remains a huge challenge before large-scale applications. Herein we develop an aqueous-oil binary solution based blend (AOB) binder characterized by a spidroin-like hierarchical structure for tolerating huge volume change of silicon-based electrodes.

         <title>Light&#8208;based Three&#8208;Dimensional Printing of Complex&#8208;Shaped Photonic Colloidal Glasses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Colloidal glasses display angle&#8208;independent structural color that is tunable by the size and local arrangement of submicron particles. While films, droplets and microcapsules with isotropic structural color have been demonstrated, the shaping of colloidal glasses in three dimensions remains an open manufacturing challenge. Here, we report a light&#8208;based printing platform for the shaping of colloidal glasses into three&#8208;dimensional objects featuring complex geometries and vivid structural color after thermal treatment. Rheology, photopolymerization and calcination experiments are performed to design the photoreactive resins leading to printable colloidal glasses. With the help of microscopy, scattering and optical characterization, we show that the photonic properties of the printed objects reflect the locally ordered microstructure of the glass. The capability of the platform in creating three&#8208;dimensional objects with isotropic structural color is illustrated by printing lattices and miniaturized sculpture replicas with unique shapes and multimaterial designs.

         <title>High&#8208;density Integration of Ultrabright OLEDs on a Miniaturized Needle&#8208;shaped CMOS backplane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Direct deposition of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) on silicon&#8208;based complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) chips has enabled self&#8208;emissive microdisplays with high resolution and fill&#8208;factor. Emerging applications of OLEDs in augmented and virtual reality (AR/VRss) displays and in biomedical applications, e.g. as brain implants for cell&#8208;specific light delivery in optogenetics, require light intensities orders of magnitude above those found in traditional displays. Further requirements often include a microscopic device footprint, a specific shape and an ultrastable passivation, e.g. to ensure biocompatibility and minimal invasiveness of OLED&#8208;based implants. Here, up to 1024 ultrabright, microscopic OLEDs were deposited directly on needle&#8208;shaped CMOS chips. Transmission electron microscopy and energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy were performed on the foundry&#8208;provided aluminum contact pads of the CMOS chips to guide a systematic optimization of the contacts. Plasma treatment and implementation of silver interlayers led to ohmic contact conditions and thus facilitated direct vacuum deposition of orange and blue&#8208;emitting OLED stacks leading to micrometer&#8208;sized pixels on the chips. The electronics in each needle allowed to switch each pixel individually. OLED pixels generated a mean optical power density of 0.25&#160;mW/mm2, corresponding to &gt;40,000&#160;cd/m2, well above the requirement for daylight AR applications and optogenetic single&#8208;unit activation in the brain.

         <title>Interfacial Regulation for 3D Printing based on Slice&#8208;Based Photopolymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The significant progress in slice&#8208;based 3D printing has boomed the rapid development of advanced manufacturing fields worldwide for scientific research and commercial communities. This review discusses the scientific impetus for improving the printing process and the printing details of slice&#8208;based 3D&#8208;printing technology from the point of view of the involved interfaces and corresponding interfacial adhesions.








Abstract
3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, can turn computer&#8208;aided designs into delicate structures directly and on demand by eliminating expensive molds, dies, or lithographic masks. Among the various technical forms, light&#8208;based 3D printing mainly involved the control of polymer&#8208;based matter fabrication and realized a field of manufacturing with high tunability of printing format, speed, and precision. Emerging slice&#8208; and light&#8208;based 3D&#8208;printing methods have prosperously advanced in recent years but still present challenges to the versatility of printing continuity, printing process, and printing details control. Herein, the field of slice&#8208; and light&#8208;based 3D printing is discussed and summarized from the view of interfacial regulation strategies to improve the printing continuity, printing process control, and the character of printed results, and several potential strategies to construct complex 3D structures of distinct characteristics with extra external fields, which are favorable for the further improvement and development of 3D printing, are proposed.

         <title>Dynamical Behaviors of Oscillating Metallosurfactant Coacervate Microdroplets under Redox Stress</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic coacervation is presented from redox&#8208;active metallosurfactants as a model system to study non&#8208;equilibrium phenomena in life. The compartmentalized protocell coacervates display collective dynamics that synchronize into system oscillations, showing autonomous death/regeneration and contraction/expansion cycles sustaining both in solution and at colloidal interface, allowing for dynamic sequestration, mass transport and passing through nanosized channels.








Abstract
Living systems create complex structures and functions by mastering self&#8208;organization in a variety of equilibrium and non&#8208;equilibrium states. Mimicking the dynamical phenomena with synthetic cell&#8208;like entities (protocells) under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions offers an important step toward the representation of minimum life. Here, the cell&#8208;sized coacervate microdroplets assembled from associative metallosurfactant coacervation via liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) that exhibits non&#8208;equilibrium behaviors are reported. The compartmentalized protocell coacervates display collective dynamics that synchronize into system oscillations, showing autonomous death/regeneration and contraction/expansion cycles with external redox stress. The collective oscillation of abiotic metallosurfactant microdroplets can sustain both in solution and at the colloidal interface, allowing for dynamic sequestration, mass transport, and passing through nanosized channels, reminiscent of red blood cells&#160;that can deform and squeeze through narrow capillaries. The design of self&#8208;oscillating cell&#8208;sized constructs will shed a light on the creation of life&#8208;like soft materials with autonomous motion driven by complex chemical stimuli, which can be further used as nonbiological models for dynamic aggregates and intercellular communication.

The design of self-oscillating cell-sized constructs will shed a light on the creation of life-like soft materials with autonomous motion driven by complex chemical stimuli, which can be further used as nonbiological models for dynamic aggregates and intercellular communication.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Mediated DNA Nanotechnology in 3D: Structural Library by Templated Diffraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The founding objective of structural DNA nanoscience is demonstrated by using self&#8208;assembled DNA scaffolds for the structure determination of biomolecules by X&#8208;ray diffraction. A structural library of 32 metal&#8208;mediated DNA base pairs (mmDNA) with Ag+, Hg2+, and Au+is assembled and the fundamental design rules for an expanded mmDNA coding system further elucidated, toward the development of molecular electronics and designer nanomaterials.








Abstract
DNA double helices containing metal&#8208;mediated DNA (mmDNA) base pairs are constructed from Ag+ and Hg2+ ions between pyrimidine:pyrimidine pairs with the promise of nanoelectronics. Rational design of mmDNA nanomaterials is impractical without a complete lexical and structural description. Here, the programmability of structural DNA nanotechnology toward its founding mission of self&#8208;assembling a diffraction platform for biomolecular structure determination is explored. The tensegrity triangle is employed to build a comprehensive structural library of mmDNA pairs via X&#8208;ray diffraction and generalized design rules for mmDNA construction are elucidated. Two binding modes are uncovered: N3&#8208;dominant, centrosymmetric pairs and major groove binders driven by 5&#8208;position ring modifications. Energy gap calculations show additional levels in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of mmDNA structures, rendering them attractive molecular electronic candidates.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Resonant Mie Resonator Arrays for Broadband Light Trapping in Ultrathin c&#8208;Si Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanophotonic design strategy to realize Mie&#8208;resonator arrays that can combine antireflection and light&#8208;trapping functions in a single, thin layer is discussed. The proposed light&#8208;trapping antireflection coating is experimentally demonstrated on a 2.8&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick crystalline silicon (c&#8208;Si) solar cell, resulting in a 48% enhancement in the short&#8208;circuit current as compared to a planar cell and an absolute efficiency of 11.2%.








Abstract
Effective photon management is critical to realize high power conversion efficiencies for thin crystalline silicon (c&#8208;Si) solar cells. Standard few&#8208;100&#8208;&#181;m&#8208;thick bulk cells achieve light trapping with macroscopic surface textures covered by thin, continuous antireflection coatings. Such sizeable textures are challenging to implement on ultrathin cells. Here, it is illustrated how nanoscale Mie&#8208;resonator&#8208;arrays with a bimodal size distribution support multiple resonances that can work in concert to achieve simultaneous antireflection and light&#8208;trapping across the broad solar spectrum. The effectiveness of these light&#8208;trapping antireflection coatings is experimentally demonstrated on a 2.8&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick c&#8208;Si solar cell. The measured short&#8208;circuit current and corresponding power conversion efficiency are notably improved, achieving efficiencies as high as 11.2%. Measurements of the saturation current density on completed cells indicate that thermal oxides can effectively limit surface recombination. The presented design principles are applicable to a wide range of solar cells.

         <title>Active Thermal Metasurfaces for Remote Heating/Cooling by Mimicking Negative Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A long&#8208;focus thermal lens with equivalent negative thermal conductivity is designed and experimentally realized to achieve a remote heating/cooling effect. The thermal lens consists of active thermal metasurfaces, which are constructed by p/n&#8208;type semiconductor pairs driven by a DC power supply. The proposed method can also achieve other novel thermal effects, such as thermal superlens and thermal tunneling effects.








Abstract
Remote temperature control can be obtained by a long&#8208;focus thermal lens that can focus heat fluxes into a spot far from the back surface of the lens and create a virtual thermal source/sink in the background material, around which the temperature field distribution can be remotely controlled by varying the parameters of the thermal lens. However, because of the lack of negative thermal conductivity, existing thermal lenses have extremely short focal lengths and cannot be used to remotely control the temperature field around the virtual thermal source/sink. In this study, a general approach is proposed to equivalently realize materials with negative thermal conductivity using elaborately distributed active thermal metasurfaces (ATMSs). Subsequently, the proposed ATMS is used to implement a novel thermal lens with a long focal length designed using transformation thermodynamics, and finally realize the ATMS with realistic materials and experimentally verify the performance of the designed long&#8208;focus thermal lens (measured focal length of 19.8&#160;mm) for remote heating/cooling. The proposed method expands the scope of the thermal conductivity and provides new pathways to realize unprecedented thermal effects with effective negative thermal conductivity, such as &#8220;thermal surface plasmon polaritons,&#8221; a thermal superlens, the thermal tunneling effect, and the thermal invisible gateway.

         <title>Albumin&#8208;Hitchhiking Drug Delivery to Tumor&#8208;Draining Lymph Nodes Precisely Boosts Tumor&#8208;Specific Immunity through Autophagy Modulation of Immune Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pH&#8208;responsive &#8220;albumin&#8208;hitchhiking&#8221; micelle POR/DT is established by self&#8208;assembly of tumor&#8208;targeting oxaliplatin prodrug (POR) and lipophilized trehalose prodrug (DT). POR prodrug can cause tumor cells&#8217; immunogenic death and antigen release, while lipophilic modification enhances autophagy inducer's binding to endogenous albumin and realizes TDLN&#8208;selective reflux, where it upregulates autophagy&#8208;mediated antigen processing and presentation in DCs.








Abstract
Tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) are the first sites where tumor components reach and dendritic cells (DCs) present tumor&#8208;associated antigens to T cells. DCs rely on autophagy to process tumor antigens into epitope peptides to form epitope&#8208;MHC complexes. Selective delivery of autophagy&#8208;stimulating drugs to TDLNs may be a precise strategy to boost chemotherapy&#8208;induced antitumor immunity. Here, a multistage stimulating strategy is proposed to activate the antitumor immunity cascade by inducing immunogenic death of tumor cells and elevating antigen presentation of DCs in TDLNs. A tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;responsive &#8220;albumin&#8208;hitchhiking&#8221; micelle is established by self&#8208;assembling tumor&#8208;targeting oxaliplatin prodrug and lipophilized trehalose prodrug. This demonstrates that lipophilic modification of trehalose with a DSPE tail and the precise exposure in the tumor site enhances its binding to endogenous albumin and realizes TDLNs&#8208;selective reflux, where it upregulates antigen processing and presentation of DCs. This study introduces an approach for targeted delivery to TDLNs and provides insights into mechanisms of autophagy in tumor&#8208;specific immunity.

         <title>Optical Switching of Hole Transfer in Double&#8208;Perovskite/Graphene Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge transfer across heterostructure interfaces crucially determines device applications, including light sensing. In this work, an optical switching of the hole&#8208;transfer direction and efficiency across strongly coupled double&#8208;perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6/graphene heterostructures by tuning the excitation wavelength is reported. This provides a novel way to control the interfacial charge flow across a semiconductor/graphene heterojunction.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;Charge transfer across heterostructure interfaces crucially determines device applications, including light sensing. In this work, an optical switching of the hole-transfer direction and efficiency across strongly coupled double-perovskite Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AgBiBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/graphene heterostructures by tuning the excitation wavelength is reported.

         <title>Quantum Dots Facilitate 3D Two&#8208;Photon Laser Lithography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D two&#8208;photon laser lithography is considered a disruptive nanostructuring technology in many fields. However, enhancing the printing resolution and developing new printing materials are still in much demand. In this work, a cost&#8208;effective method to tackle this situation, by incorporating chemically modified quantum dots, is presented, showing superb performance improvement. The resolution enhancement mechanism is then further elucidated.








Abstract
In the past two decades, direct laser writing (DLW) technologies have seen tremendous growth. However, strategies that enhance the printing resolution and the development of printing material with assorted functionalities are still sparser than expected. Herein, a cost&#8208;effective method to tackle this bottleneck is presented. Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are selected to carry out this task, most importantly via surface chemistry modification to enable their copolymerization with themonomers, resulting in transparent composites. The evaluations indicate that the QDs show great colloidal stability and their photoluminescent properties are well&#8208;preserved. This allows further exploration of the printing characteristics of such composite material. It is shown that in the presence of the QDs, the material provides a much lower polymerization threshold with faster linewidth growth, indicating that the QDs form a synergetic relationship with the monomer and the photoinitiator, widening the dynamic range of the material and thus increasing the writing efficiency for broader fields of applications. Lowering the polymerization threshold reduces the minimum achievable feature size by &#8776;32%, which is well&#8208;matched with STED&#8208;based (i.e., stimulated&#8208;emission depletion microscopy) methods in writing 3D structures. The study further elucidates the mechanism of the synergetic behavior, further guiding the future development of functional materials for DLW&#8208;related printing technologies.

An LGWH&#8208;driven interfacial water evaporation system based on 3D superhydrophilic foam offers a record&#8208;high steam generation for clean water production and salt recovery from high salinity water (seawater or wastewater)








Abstract
Clean water scarcity and energy shortage have become urgent global problems due to population growth and human industrial development. Low&#8208;grade waste heat (LGWH) is a widely available and ubiquitous byproduct of human activities worldwide, which can provide effective power to address the fresh water crisis without additional energy consumption and carbon emissions. In this regard, 3D superhydrophilic polyurethane/sodium alginate (PU/SA) foam and LGWH&#8208;driven interfacial water evaporation systems are developed, which can precipitate over 80&#160;L&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 steam generation from seawater and has favorable durability for purification of high salinity wastewater. The excellent water absorption ability, unobstructed water transport, and uniform thin water layer formed on 3D skeletons of PU/SA foam ensure the strong heat exchange between LGWH and fluidic water. As a result, the heat&#8208;localized PU/SA foam enables the efficient energy utilization and ultrafast water evaporation once LGWH is introduced into PU/SA foam as heat flow. In addition, the precipitated salt on PU/SA foam can be easily removed by mechanical compression, and almost no decrease in water evaporation rate after salt precipitation and removal for many times. Meanwhile, the collected clean water has high rejection of ions of 99.6%, which meets the World Health Organization (WHO) standard of drinking water. Above all, this LGWH&#8208;driven interfacial water evaporation system presents a promising and easily accessible solution for clean water production and water&#8211;salt separation without additional energy burden for the society.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot, Three&#8208;Phase Recycling of Metals from Li&#8208;Ion Batteries in Rotating, Concentric&#8208;Liquid Reactors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal mixtures from spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries are rapidly and selectively separated one&#8208;pot in a rotating, concentric&#8208;liquid reactor. In this reactor, vigorous stirring at interfacial regions does not cause mixing of the aqueous metal&#8208;feed and acceptor layers, while the organic extractants are allowed to shuttle between these layers multiple times.








Abstract
Efficient recycling of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is essential for making their numerous applications sustainable. Hydrometallurgy&#8208;based separation methods are an indispensable part of the recycling process but remain limited by the extraction efficiency and selectivity, and typically require numerous binary liquid&#8211;liquid extraction steps in which the capacity of the extracting organic phase or partition coefficient of extracted metals become an overall bottleneck. Herein, rotating reactors are described, in which the aqueous feed, organic extractant, and aqueous acceptor phases are all present in the same rotating vessel and can be vigorously stirred and emulsified without the coalescence of aqueous layers. In this arrangement, the extractant molecules are not equilibrated with the feed and, instead, &#8220;shuttle&#8221; between the feed/extractant and the extractant/acceptor interfaces multiple times, with each such molecule ultimately transferring approximately ten metal ions. This shuttling allows for using extractant concentrations much lower than in previous designs even for extremely concentrated feeds and, simultaneously, ensures unprecedented speed and selectivity of the one&#8208;pot processes. These experimental results are accompanied by theoretical considerations of the selectivity versus speed trends as well as discussion of parameters essential for system upscaling.

         <title>Direct Probing of Lattice&#8208;Strain&#8208;Induced Oxygen Release in LiCoO2 and Li2MnO3 without Electrochemical Cycling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic&#8208;scale observation directly shows that a significant amount of oxygen loss is induced exclusively by lattice strain in pristine layered oxides without any electrochemical Li extraction under high voltage application. This work offers crucial insight toward the importance of strain relaxation to suppress oxygen loss for better cycling performance of layered oxide cathodes.








Abstract
Since the recognition of a significant oxygen&#8208;redox contribution to enhancing the capacity of Li transition&#8208;metal oxide cathodes, the oxygen release and subsequent structural variations together with capacity fading are critical issues to achieve better electrochemical performance. As most previous reports dealt with the structural degradation of cathodes after electrochemical cycling, it is fairly difficult to clarify how substantial the effect of lattice strain on the oxygen release will be while exclusively ruling out any electrochemical influences. By utilizing nanoindentation and mechanical surface polishing of single&#8208;crystal LiCoO2 and Li2MnO3, the local variations of both the atomic structure and oxygen content are scrutinized. Atomic&#8208;column&#8208;resolved imaging reveals that local Li&#63743;M (M = Co and Mn) disordering and further amorphization are induced by mechanical strain. Moreover, substantial oxygen deficiency in the regions with these structural changes is directly identified by spectroscopic analyses. Ab initio density functional theory calculations also demonstrate energetically favorable formation of oxygen vacancies under shear strain. Providing direct evidence of oxygen release as a consequence of lattice strain, the findings in this work suggest that efficient strain relaxation will be of great significance for longevity of the anion framework in layered oxide cathodes.

         <title>Interfacial&#8208;Catalysis&#8208;Enabled Layered and Inorganic&#8208;Rich SEI on Hard Carbon Anodes in Ester Electrolytes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
An innovative interface catalysis mechanism is developed to controllably design a homogenous, layered, and inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on hard carbon anodes in ester electrolytes by surface&#8208;reconstruction with abundant C&#63742;O (carbonyl) bonds, which are active centers for preferentially catalyzing salt reduction. Due to such rationally regulated SEI, sodium&#8208;storage performance regarding initial Columbic efficiency, rate capability, and cycling stability is comprehensively enhanced.








Abstract
Constructing a homogenous and inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) can efficiently improve the overall sodium&#8208;storage performance of hard carbon (HC) anodes. However, the thick and heterogenous SEI derived from conventional ester electrolytes fails to meet the above requirements. Herein, an innovative interfacial catalysis mechanism is proposed to design a favorable SEI in ester electrolytes by reconstructing the surface functionality of HC, of which abundant C&#63742;O (carbonyl) bonds are accurately and homogenously implanted. The C&#63742;O (carbonyl) bonds act as active centers that controllably catalyze the preferential reduction of salts and directionally guide SEI growth to form a homogenous, layered, and inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. Therefore, excessive solvent decomposition is suppressed, and the interfacial Na+ transfer and structural stability of SEI on HC anodes are greatly promoted, contributing to a comprehensive enhancement in sodium&#8208;storage performance. The optimal anodes exhibit an outstanding reversible capacity (379.6 mAh g&#8722;1), an ultrahigh initial Coulombic efficiency (93.2%), a largely improved rate capability, and an extremely stable cycling performance with a capacity decay rate of 0.0018% for 10&#8239;000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1. This work provides novel insights into smart regulation of interface chemistry to realize high&#8208;performance HC anodes for sodium storage.

         <title>Mobile Kink Solitons in a Van der Waals Charge&#8208;Density&#8208;Wave Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mobile solitons are discovered in a van der Waals material as kinks and antikinks along domain walls in the 2D layer with spontaneously broken symmetry. The mobility, electronic states, and topology of kink solitons are elucidated, which makes the application of solitons in van der Waals electronic materials promising.








Abstract
Kinks, point&#8208;like geometrical defects along dislocations, domain walls, and DNA, are stable and mobile, as solutions of a sine&#8208;Gordon wave equation. While they are widely investigated for crystal deformations and domain wall motions, electronic properties of individual kinks have received little attention. In this work, electronically and topologically distinct kinks are discovered along electronic domain walls in a correlated van der Waals insulator of 1T&#8208;TaS2. Mobile kinks and antikinks are identified as trapped by pinning defects and imaged in scanning tunneling microscopy. Their atomic structures and in&#8208;gap electronic states are unveiled, which are mapped approximately into Su&#8211;Schrieffer&#8211;Heeger solitons. The twelvefold degeneracy of the domain walls in the present system guarantees an extraordinarily large number of distinct kinks and antikinks to emerge. Such large degeneracy together with the robust geometrical nature may be useful for handling multilevel information in van der Waals materials&#160;architectures.

         <title>Design of Fluoro&#8208;Free Surfaces Super&#8208;Repellent to Low&#8208;Surface&#8208;Tension Liquids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The widespread use of perfluoroalkyls for super&#8208;liquid&#8208;repellent surfaces is environmentally unsustainable, motivating the exploration of fluoro&#8208;free alternatives. In this work, the concept of liquid&#8208;centric design and the revised limits for using fluoro&#8208;free materials (hydrocarbons and silicones) in achieving super&#8208;liquid&#8208;repellency with low&#8208;surface&#8208;tension liquids is demonstrated. Scale bar in image: 1 mm. 








Abstract
Super&#8208;liquid&#8208;repellent surfaces feature high liquid contact angles and low sliding angles find key applications in anti&#8208;fouling and self&#8208;cleaning. While repellency for water is easily achieved with hydrocarbon functionalities, repellency for many low&#8208;surface&#8208;tension liquids (down to 30 mN&#160;m&#8722;1) still requires perfluoroalkyls (a persistent environmental pollutant and bioaccumulation hazard). Here, the scalable room&#8208;temperature synthesis of stochastic nanoparticle surfaces with fluoro&#8208;free moieties is investigated. Silicone (dimethyl and monomethyl) and hydrocarbon surface chemistries are benchmarked against perfluoroalkyls, assessed using model low&#8208;surface&#8208;tension liquids (ethanol&#8211;water mixtures). It is discovered that both hydrocarbon&#8208; and dimethyl&#8208;silicone&#8208;based functionalization can achieve super&#8208;liquid&#8208;repellency down to 40&#8211;41 mN&#160;m&#8722;1 and 32&#8211;33 mN&#160;m&#8722;1, respectively (vs&#160;27&#8211;32 mN&#160;m&#8722;1 for perfluoroalkyls). The dimethyl silicone variant demonstrates superior fluoro&#8208;free liquid repellency likely due to its denser dimethyl molecular configuration. It is shown that perfluoroalkyls are not necessary for many real&#8208;world scenarios requiring super&#8208;liquid&#8208;repellency. Effective super&#8208;repellency of different surface chemistries against different liquids can be adequately predicted using empirically verified phase diagrams. These findings encourage a liquid&#8208;centric design, i.e., tailoring surfaces for target liquid properties. Herein, key guidelines are provided for achieving functional yet sustainably designed super&#8208;liquid&#8208;repellency.

         <title>Hydroiodic&#8208;Acid&#8208;Initiated Dense yet Porous Ti3C2Tx MXene Monoliths toward Superhigh Areal Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gelation&#8211;densification approach of MXenes to produce thick and dense electrodes with superhigh areal capacitance is proposed. Hydroiodide acids can not only serve as initiators to trigger the gelation of MXenes and construct stable 3D&#160;networks, but also leave highly shrinking porous structures by application of capillary forces during their controlled removal.








Abstract
The assembly of 3D&#160;structured materials from 2D&#160;units paves a royal road for building thick and dense electrodes, which are long sought after for practical energy&#8208;storage devices. 2D transitional metal carbides (MXene) are promising for this due to their capabilities of solution&#8208;based assembly and intrinsic high density, yet face huge challenges in yielding high areal capacitance electrodes owing to the absence of porous ion&#8208;transport paths. Here, a gelation&#8211;densification process initiated by hydroiodide acids (HI) is proposed, where the protons break the electrostatic balance of MXene nanosheets to trigger gelation, while HI serves as a spacer to prevent nanosheets from restacking during capillary shrinkage. More promising, the controlled evaporation of reductive HI leaves superiorly shrinking yet porous network for ion transport, and the produced monoliths exhibit a high density of 2.74&#160;g cm&#8722;3 and an unprecedented areal capacitance of 18.6 F cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Rapid and Scalable Transfer of Large&#8208;Area Graphene Wafers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the engineering of interfacial forces during the transfer process, the crack&#8208;free and clean transfer of 4&#8208;inch&#8208;sized graphene wafers onto silicon wafers within only 15&#160;min is realized, which is compatible with batch production of graphene wafers on target substrates.








Abstract
Recently, scalable production of large&#8208;area graphene films on metal foils with promising qualities is successfully achieved by eliminating grain boundaries, wrinkles, and adlayers. The transfer of graphene from growth metal substrates onto functional substrates remains one inescapable obstacle on the road to the real commercial applications of chemical vaport deposition (CVD) graphene films. Current transfer methods still require time&#8208;consuming chemical reactions, which hinders its mass production, and produces cracks and contamination that strongly impede performance reproducibility. Therefore, graphene transfer techniques with fine intactness and cleanness of transferred graphene, and improved production efficiency would be ideal for the mass production of graphene films on destination substrates. Herein, through the engineering of interfacial forces enabled by sophisticated design of transfer medium, the crack&#8208;free and clean transfer of 4&#8208;inch&#8208;sized graphene wafers onto silicon wafers within only 15&#160;min is realized. The reported transfer method is an important leap over the long&#8208;lasting obstacle of the batch&#8208;scale graphene transfer without degrading the quality of graphene, bringing the graphene products close to the real applications.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Rich Piezoelectric BiO2&#8722;x Nanosheets for Augmented Piezocatalytic, Sonothermal, and Enzymatic Therapies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich BiO2&#8722;x nanosheet is developed by a defect engineering strategy to enhance reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by lowering the energy gap, and is applied for the synergistic piezocatalytic, enzymatic, and sonothermal therapies. Density functional theory calculations show that the oxygen vacancies are favorable for H2O2&#160;adsorption and increasing the carrier density to produce ROS.








Abstract
Piezocatalytic therapy is a new&#8208;emerging reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;enabled therapeutic strategy that relies on built&#8208;in electric field and energy&#8208;band bending of piezoelectric materials activated by ultrasound (US) irradiation. Despite becoming a hot topic, material development and mechanism exploration are still underway. Herein, as&#8208;synthesized oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich BiO2&#8722;x nanosheets (NSs) demonstrate outstanding piezoelectric properties. Under US, a piezo&#8208;potential of 0.25&#160;V for BiO2&#8722;x NSs is sufficient to tilt the conduction band to be more negative than the redox potentials of O2/&#8226;O2&#8722;, &#8226;O2&#8722;/H2O2, and H2O2/&#8226;OH, which initiates a cascade reaction for ROS generation. Moreover, the BiO2&#8722;x NSs exhibit peroxidase and oxidase&#8208;like activities to augment ROS production, especially in the H2O2&#8208;overexpressed tumor microenvironment. Density functional theory calculations show that the generated oxygen vacancies in BiO2&#8722;x NSs are favorable for H2O2&#160;adsorption and increasing the carrier density to produce ROS. Furthermore, the quick movement of electrons enables an excellent sonothermal effect, for example, rapid rise in temperature to nearly 65&#160;&#176;C upon US with low power (1.2&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2) and short time (96&#160;s). Therefore, this system realizes a multimode synergistic combination of piezocatalytic, enzymatic, and sonothermal therapies, providing a new direction for defect engineering&#8208;optimized piezoelectric materials for tumor therapy.

         <title>A Composite of Hierarchical Porous MOFs and Halloysite Nanotubes as Single&#8208;Ion&#8208;Conducting Electrolyte Toward High&#8208;Performance Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

A novel H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8/HNT composite of hierarchical porous H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8 and hollow halloysite nanotube is employed as an electrolyte in lithium&#8208;ion conduction in solid&#8208;state batteries, presenting excellent comprehensive electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), as a promising rechargeable electrochemical energy storage material have emerged in the field of solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. However, low ionic conductivity and high interfacial impedance still severely hamper the application of MOF&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSE). In this work, a novel hierarchical porous H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8 solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) material is harvested through the in situ growth of zinc nitrate hydroxide nanosheets, expressing excellent ion conductivity of 1.04 &#215; 10&#8722;3&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 and Li+&#8208;transference number of 0.71. Moreover, the morphology and structure of H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8 is further optimized to obtain a composite H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8/HNT by decorating halloysite nanotubes (HNT). Notably, functionalized H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8/HNT as an electrolyte presents obvious enhancement on electrochemical properties: higher ionic conductivity of 7.74 &#215; 10&#8722;3&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1, better single&#8208;ion transmittability (tLi+${t}_{{\mathrm{Li}}^{+}}$ = 0.84), good interfacial compatibility as well as excellent rate performance. More importantly, the Li/LiFePO4 battery equipped with H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8/HNT SSE has efficient lithium&#8208;dendrite suppression and up to 84% capacity retention (104.16&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1) after 200 times galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles. This work enriches the solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion composite electrolyte materials, opening an entirely new way for enhancing electrochemical performance.

         <title>Nacre&#8208;Mimetic Nanocomposite Aerogels with Exceptional Mechanical Performance for Thermal Superinsulation at Extreme Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nacre&#8208;mimetic nanocomposite aerogels featuring a &#8220;porous brick and fiber&#8221; architecture are fabricated via in situ nanoscale hetero&#8208;assembly and ambient pressure drying, in which mesoporous minerals are generated in a lamellar cellulose nanofibrous network. The aerogels integrate challenging requirements of thermal superinsulation, excellent compressive stiffness, superelasticity, high bending flexibility, good impact resistance, and easy scalability for robust thermal management under extreme conditions.








Abstract
Thermal protection under extreme conditions requires materials with excellent thermal insulation properties and exceptional mechanical properties to withstand a variety of complex external stresses. Mesoporous silica aerogels are the most widely used insulation materials due to their ultralow thermal conductivity. However, they still suffer from mechanical fragility and structural instability in practical applications. Herein, a nacre&#8208;mimetic nanocomposite aerogel, synthesized via in situ growth of inorganic minerals in a lamellar cellulose nanofibrous network, is reported. The multiscale structural adaptation of the inorganic&#8211;organic components endows nanocomposite aerogels with rapid configuration recovery during ambient pressure drying. The resulting aerogels show ultralow thermal conductivities (17.4&#160;mW&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1 at 1.0 atm). These aerogels also integrate challenging mechanical properties, including high compressive stiffness to resist deformation under the pressure of an adult, superelasticity to prevent static and dynamic stress cracking even under the crushing of a vehicle (1.6 t), and high bending flexibility to adapt to any surface. Moreover, they exhibit excellent structural stability under fatigue stress/strain cycles over a wide temperature range (&#8722;196 to 200&#160;&#176;C). The combination of high thermal insulation performance and excellent mechanical properties offers a potential material system for robust thermal superinsulation under extreme conditions, especially for aerospace applications.

         <title>Ultrafast Superfilling Construction of a Metal Artificial Interface for Long&#8208;Term Stable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superfilling strategy using thiourea molecules for kinetic regulation is demonstrated as an effective approach for constructing metal artificial interfaces. Owing to the coordination of thiourea molecules with metal ions, instantaneous nucleation of Sn is regulated into progressive nucleation. The constructed Sn@Zn anode is conducive to uniform nucleation and 2D&#160;diffusion growth of zinc during the battery cycling.








Abstract
Zinc (Zn)&#8208;metal anodes are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale, highly safe energy&#8208;storage systems. However, their cycling life is associated with instability issues such as dendritic growth, corrosion, and hydrogen evolution. Introducing an artificial metal interface is expected to help overcome this challenge owing to the optimization of the absorption, nucleation, and growth of Zn2+. In this study, an ultrafast, universal, and cost&#8208;effective superfilling approach is developed to construct a metal artificial interface decorated Zn anode in situ. Most zincophilic metals, including Sn, Cu, and Ag, can be used to construct a homogenous interface without any restrictions on the size, morphology, or curvature of the substrates. With Sn as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, the as&#8208;obtained Sn@Zn anode is conducive for the homogenous Zn nuclei and 2D&#160;diffusion of Zn2+ ions. Symmetric cells with Sn@Zn electrodes can be operated for over 900&#160;h at different current densities. This superior performance contributes to the attractive electrochemical characteristics of both coin and scaled&#8208;up Sn@Zn//&#946;&#8208;MnO2 cells. Given the facile and cost&#8208;effective fabrication and recyclability of the cells, this work enables the efficient design and exploration of Zn anodes for research, industrialization, and commercialization purposes.

         <title>Incorporating Wireless Strategies to Wearable Devices Enabled by a Photocurable Hydrogel&#160;for Monitoring Pressure Information</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photocurable hydrogel is developed to implement a two&#8208;in&#8208;one wearable device with a simple structure, which can quantify and visualize pressure simultaneously. Incorporated with wireless strategies, two integrated systems of smart patch and passive sensing are demonstrated, showing the potential for timely and on&#8208;site monitoring of physiological signals, and human&#8211;machine interfaces for various pressure information acquisition.








Abstract
Advances in emerging technologies for wireless collection and the timely analysis of various information captured by wearable devices are of growing interest. Herein, a crosslinked ionic hydrogel prepared by a facile photocuring process is proposed, which&#160;allows wearable devices to be further incorporated into two wireless integrated systems for pressure monitoring applications. The device exhibits a simplified structure by effectively sharing functional layers, rather than conventional two separate combinations, offering the salient performance of iontronic sensing and electrochromic properties to simultaneously quantify and visualize pressure. The developed smart patch system is demonstrated to monitor physiological signals in real&#8208;time utilizing the user interface of remote portable equipment with the Bluetooth protocol and on&#8208;site electrochromic displays. Moreover, a passive wireless system based on the magnetic coupling effect is designed, which can operate free from the battery and simultaneously acquire multiple pressure information. It is envisioned that the strategies would hold enormous potential for flexible electronics, versatile sensing platforms, and wireless on&#8208;body networks.

         <title>Modulating Oxygen Vacancies in Lead Chromate for&#160;Photoelectrocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using lead chromate (PbCrO4) as a prototype, oxygen vacancies are found to introduce shallow energy levels, and deep energy levels are identified. More surface oxygen vacancies induces the formation of deeper surface trapped states to enhance charge separation and introduce more low&#8208;oxygen&#8208;coordinated Cr centers to boost water oxidation activity.








Abstract
Although modulating oxygen vacancies in semiconductors has attracted broad interest in photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis, identifying the intrinsic roles of oxygen vacancies on photoelectrocatalytic properties is often elusive. In this work, the oxygen vacancies in a typical semiconductor lead chromate (PbCrO4) are regulated via controlling the oxygen chemical potentials of O&#8208;poor and O&#8208;rich post&#8208;annealing atmospheres. Oxygen vacancies identified in PbCrO4 can introduce electronically shallow energy levels and deep energy levels owing to the symmetry difference of oxygen atoms in the structure. A higher population of deep energy levels created under O&#8208;poor atmosphere induces the formation of more surface trapped states, resulting in a higher photovoltage for charge separation. Meanwhile, the existence of surface trapped states can significantly improve the charge injection efficiency of the PbCrO4 photoanode and enhance the water oxidation activity. By modulating oxygen vacancies in the PbCrO4 photoanode, a photocurrent density of 3.43&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under simulated AM1.5G is acheived. Further passivation of surface trapped states and introducing the water oxidation cocatalyst CoPi lead to a record applied bias photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency (ABPE) of 1.12%. This work provides a guide to understand the mechanism of oxygen vacancies in oxide&#8208;based semiconductor photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis.

         <title>Enzymatic Regulation of Protein&#8211;Protein Interactions in Artificial Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 scaffold protein is loaded in coacervate&#8208;based artificial cells, and client proteins are taken up based on their affinity for 14&#8208;3&#8208;3, which can be regulated by their phosphorylation state. Using a kinase or phosphatase, protein&#8211;protein interactions of native interaction domains are regulated in situ. This system mimics the recruitment of client proteins to biomolecular condensates.








Abstract
Membraneless organelles are important for spatial organization of proteins and regulation of intracellular processes. Proteins can be recruited to these condensates by specific protein&#8211;protein or protein&#8211;nucleic acid interactions, which are often regulated by post&#8208;translational modifications. However, the mechanisms behind these dynamic, affinity&#8208;based protein recruitment events are not well understood. Here, a coacervate system that incorporates the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 scaffold protein to study enzymatically regulated recruitment of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#8208;binding proteins is presented, which mostly bind in a phosphorylation&#8208;dependent manner. Synthetic coacervates are efficiently loaded with 14&#8208;3&#8208;3, and phosphorylated binding partners, such as the c&#8208;Raf pS233/pS259 peptide (c&#8208;Raf), show 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#8208;dependent sequestration with up to 161&#8208;fold increase in local concentration. The c&#8208;Raf domain is fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP&#8208;c&#8208;Raf) to demonstrate recruitment of proteins. In situ phosphorylation of GFP&#8208;c&#8208;Raf by a kinase leads to enzymatically regulated uptake. The introduction of a phosphatase into coacervates preloaded with the phosphorylated 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#8208;GFP&#8208;c&#8208;Raf complex results in a significant cargo efflux mediated by dephosphorylation. Finally, the general applicability of this platform to study protein&#8211;protein interactions is demonstrated by the phosphorylation&#8208;dependent and 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#8208;mediated active reconstitution of a split&#8208;luciferase inside artificial cells. This work presents an approach to study dynamically regulated protein recruitment in condensates, using native interaction domains.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Depolymerizable &#948;&#8208;Lactone Based Vitrimers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Depolymerizable vitrimers are developed through a one&#8208;pot synthesis approach. The low&#8208;ceiling&#8208;temperature polymer from the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of the biobased &#948;&#8208;lactone is cross&#8208;linked with dynamic acetal linkages. The cross&#8208;linked vitrimer allows reprocessing and healing and can easily depolymerize back to monomers for closed&#8208;loop recycling.

Abstract
A depolymerizable vitrimer that allows both reprocessability and monomer recovery by a simple and scalable one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step synthesis of vitrimers from cyclic lactones is reported. Biobased &#948;&#8208;valerolactone with alkyl substituents (&#948;&#8208;lactone) has low ceiling temperature; thus, their ring&#8208;opening&#8208;polymerized aliphatic polyesters are capable of depolymerizing back to monomers. In this work, the amorphous poly(&#948;&#8208;lactone) is solidified into an elastomer (i.e., &#948;&#8208;lactone vitrimer) by a vinyl ether cross&#8208;linker with dynamic acetal linkages, giving the merits of reprocessing and healing. Thermolysis of the bulk &#948;&#8208;lactone vitrimer at 200&#160;&#176;C can recover 85&#8211;90&#160;wt% of the material, allowing reuse without losing value and achieving a successful closed&#8208;loop life cycle. It further demonstrates that the new vitrimer has excellent properties, with the potential to serve as a biobased and sustainable replacement of conventional soft elastomers for various applications such as lenses, mold materials, soft robots, and microfluidic devices.

         <title>Mechanically Responsive Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Cellulose&#8208;Nanocrystal&#8208;Based Shape&#8208;Memory Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cellulose nanocrystal (CNC)&#8208;based luminescent shape&#8208;memory polymers are fabricated by integrating the self&#8208;assembly of CNCs with a co&#8208;polymerization strategy. By sequential hot&#8208;pressing and recovery through heating, circularly polarized luminescence can be switched on and off due to the pressure&#8208;responsive chiral nematic structures.








Abstract
Stimulus&#8208;responsive materials that display circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) have attracted great attention for application in chiral sensors and smart displays. However, due to difficulties in the regulation of chiral structures, fine control of CPL remains a challenge. Here, it is demonstrated that cellulose nanocrystal shape&#8208;memory polymers (CNC&#8208;SMPs) with luminescent components enable mechanically responsive CPL. The chiral nematic organization of CNCs in the material gives rise to a photonic bandgap. By manipulating the photonic bandgap or luminescence wavelengths of the luminescent CNC&#8208;SMPs, precise control of CPL emission with varied wavelengths and high dissymmetry factors (glum) is achieved. Specifically, CPL emission can be switched reversibly by treating the luminescent CNC&#8208;SMPs with hot&#8208;pressing and recovery by heating. Pressure&#8208;responsive CPL with tunable glum values is ascribed to the pressure&#8208;responsive photonic bandgaps. Moreover, colorimetric and CPL&#8208;active patterns are created by imprinting desired forms into SMP samples. This study demonstrates a novel way to fabricate smart CPL systems using biomaterials.

         <title>Synchronous Interventions of Glucose and Mitochondrial Metabolisms for Antitumor Bioenergetic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A glycopolymer containing a caged hydrogen sulfide and hydrogen peroxide dual&#8208;donor is synthesized to wrap glucose oxidase for synchronous interventions of glucose and mitochondrial metabolisms of tumors.








Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S)&#8208;based mitochondrial bioenergetic intervention is an attractive therapeutic modality. However, its therapeutic efficacy is limited owing to metabolic plasticity, which allows tumors to shift their metabolic phenotype between oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis for energy compensation. To overcome this flexibility, a glycopolymer containing a caged H2S and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) dual&#8208;donor (1&#8208;thio&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucose [thioglucose]) is synthesized to wrap glucose oxidase (GOx) for complete depletion of tumorigenic energy sources. The loaded GOx catalyzes the glutathione&#8208;activated thioglucose to generate cytotoxic H2S/H2O2, which further induces synergistic defects in mitochondrial function by suppressing cytochrome&#160;c oxidase expression and damaging the mitochondrial membrane potential. GOx also blocks glycolysis by depleting endogenous glucose. This synchronous intervention strategy exhibits good anticancer performance, broadening the horizon of antitumor bioenergetic therapy.

         <title>Achieving Practical High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries by a Dual&#8208;Anion Regulated Electrolyte</title>

         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;anion regulated electrolyte&#160;is developed for practical lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). The electrolyte enables fast interfacial kinetics and forms robust inorganic&#8208;rich and highly ion&#8208;conductive electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphase layers on the surfaces of the electrodes, demonstrates exceptional performance in Li||NCM83 pouch cells, and realizes LMBs&#160;with an ultrahigh capacity of 39.0 Ah and ultrahigh energy density of 521&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) using lithium&#8208;metal anodes and high&#8208;voltage cathodes have been deemed as one of the most promising high&#8208;energy&#8208;density battery technology. However, its practical application is largely hindered by the notorious dendrite growth of lithium&#8208;metal anodes, the fast structure degradation of the cathode, and insufficient electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphase kinetics. Here, a dual&#8208;anion regulated electrolyte is developed for LMBs using lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and lithium difluoro(bisoxalato)phosphate (LiDFBOP) as anion regulators. The incorporation of TFSI&#8722; in the solvation sheath reduces the desolvation energy of Li+, and DFBOP&#8722; promotes the formation of highly ion&#8208;conductive and sustainable inorganic&#8208;rich interphases on the electrodes. Significantly enhanced performance is demonstrated on Li||LiNi0.83Co0.11Mn0.06O2 pouch cells, with 84.6% capacity retention after 150 cycles in 6.0 Ah pouch cells and an ultrahigh rate capability up to 5 C in 2.0 Ah pouch cells. Furthermore, a pouch cell with an ultralarge capacity of 39.0 Ah is fabricated and achieves an ultrahigh energy density of 521.3&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. The findings provide a facile electrolyte design strategy for promoting the practical utilization of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LMBs.

         <title>Shift&#8208;Current Photovoltaics Based on a Non&#8208;Centrosymmetric Phase in In&#8208;Plane Ferroelectric SnS</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;centrosymmetric layer stacking phase of 2D tin sulfide (SnS) is successfully achieved on van der Waals substrates and the shift current in SnS is demonstrated. Following the PFM observation that reveals the existence of ferroelectric domains, an atomic model of the ferroelectric domain boundary is proposed.








Abstract
The shift&#8208;current photovoltaics of group&#8208;IV monochalcogenides has been predicted to be comparable to those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Si&#8208;based solar cells. However, its exploration has been prevented from the centrosymmetric layer stacking in the thermodynamically stable bulk crystal. Herein, the non&#8208;centrosymmetric layer stacking of tin sulfide (SnS) is stabilized in the bottom regions of SnS crystals grown on a van der Waals substrate by physical vapor deposition and the shift current of SnS, by combining the polarization angle dependence and circular photogalvanic effect, is demonstrated. Furthermore, 180&#176; ferroelectric domains in SnS are verified through both piezoresponse force microscopy and shift&#8208;current mapping techniques. Based on these results, an atomic model of the ferroelectric domain boundary is proposed. The direct observation of shift current and ferroelectric domains reported herein paves a new path for future studies on shift&#8208;current photovoltaics.

Herein, the non-centrosymmetric layer stacking of tin sulfide (SnS) is stabilized in the bottom regions of SnS crystals grown on a van der Waals substrate by physical vapor deposition and the shift current of SnS, by combining the polarization angle dependence and circular photogalvanic effect, is demonstrated. Furthermore, 180&#176; ferroelectric domains in SnS are verified through both piezoresponse force microscopy and shift-current mapping techniques. Based on these results, an atomic model of the ferroelectric domain boundary is proposed. The direct observation of shift current and ferroelectric domains reported herein paves a new path for future studies on shift-current photovoltaics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing Prosthetic Control through High&#8208;Fidelity Myoelectric Mapping with Molecular Anchoring Technology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy, molecular anchoring, is applied to improve the detection and quality of low&#8208;level myoelectric signals through gel electrode interacting with and embedding into stratum corneum. Due to high&#8208;fidelity signals based on the anchoring electrodes, the system enables an amputee to drive a prosthesis with phantom limb dexterity.








Abstract
Myoelectric control utilizes electrical signals generated from the voluntary contraction of remaining muscles in an amputee's stump to operate a prosthesis. Precise and agile control requires low&#8208;level myoelectric signals (below 10% of maximum voluntary contraction, MVC) from weak muscle contractions such as phantom finger or wrist movements, but imbalanced calcium concentration in atrophic skin can distort the signals. This is due to poor ionic&#8211;electronic coupling between skin and electrode, which often causes excessive muscle contraction, fatigue, and discomfort during delicate tasks. To overcome this challenge, a new strategy called molecular anchoring is developed to drive hydrophobic molecular effectively interact with and embed into stratum corneum for high coupling regions between ionic fluxes and electronic currents. The use of hydrophobic poly(N&#8208;vinyl caprolactam) gel has resulted in an interface impedance of 20&#160;k&#937;, which is 1/100 of a commercial acrylic&#8208;based electrode, allowing the detection of ultralow myoelectric signals (&#8776;1.5% MVC) that approach human limits. With this molecular anchoring technology, amputees operate a prosthesis with greater dexterity, as phantom finger and wrist movements are predicted with 97.6% accuracy. This strategy provides the potential for a comfortable human&#8211;machine interface when amputees accomplish day&#8208;to&#8208;day tasks through precise and dexterous myoelectric control.

         <title>Physicochemical Dual Cross&#8208;Linking Conductive Polymeric Networks Combining High Strength and High Toughness Enable Stable Operation of Silicon Microparticle Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A physicochemical dual cross&#8208;linking conductive polymeric network coupling the stiffness of poly(acrylic acid) and the softness of carboxyl nitrile rubber includes robust chemical cross&#8208;linking and multiple physical cross&#8208;linking. Such a design can effectively dissipate the undesirable stress of silicon microparticle anodes by folded molecular chains slipping and sequential cleavage of H&#8208;bonds, thus stabilizing the electrode interface and enhancing cycle stability.








Abstract
The poor interfacial stability and insufficient cycling performance caused by undesirable stress hinder the commercial application of silicon microparticles (&#181;Si) as next&#8208;generation anode materials for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, a conceptionally novel physicochemical dual cross&#8208;linking conductive polymeric network is designed combining high strength and high toughness by coupling the stiffness of poly(acrylic acid)&#160;and the softness of carboxyl nitrile rubber, which includes multiple H&#8208;bonds, by introducing highly branched tannic acid as a physical cross&#8208;linker. Such a design enables effective stress dissipation by folded molecular chains slipping and sequential cleavage of H&#8208;bonds, thus stabilizing the electrode interface and enhancing cycle stability. As expected, the resultant electrode (&#181;Si/PTBR) delivers an unprecedented high capacity retention of &#8776;97% from 2027.9 mAh g&#8722;1 at the 19th to 1968.0 mAh g&#8722;1 at the 200th cycle at 2 A g&#8722;1. Meanwhile, this unique stress dissipation strategy is also suitable for stabilizing SiOx anodes with a much lower capacity loss of &#8776;0.012% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1.5 A g&#8722;1. Atomic force microscopy analysis and finite element simulations reveal the excellent stress&#8208;distribution ability of the physicochemical dual cross&#8208;linking conductive polymeric network. This work provides an efficient energy&#8208;dissipation strategy toward practical high&#8208;capacity anodes for energy&#8208;dense batteries.

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Energy Transfer between Dye&#8208;Loaded Nanoparticles: Observation and Amplified Detection of Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The operating range of F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer is fundamentally limited by the F&#246;rster radius of &#8776;5 nm. A study of dye&#8208;loaded fluorescent polymeric nanoparticles connected by DNA duplexes of different lengths reveals efficient energy transfer far beyond the F&#246;rster radius, following a power&#8208;four distance dependence. This phenomenon is applied for amplified detection of a target nucleic acid with attomole sensitivity.








Abstract
F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is essential in optical materials for light&#8208;harvesting, photovoltaics, and biosensing, but its operating range is fundamentally limited by the F&#246;rster radius of &#8776;5&#160;nm. In this work, FRET between fluorescent organic nanoparticles (NPs) is studied in order to break this limit. The donor and acceptor NPs are built from charged hydrophobic polymers loaded with cationic dyes and bulky hydrophobic counterions. Their surface is functionalized with DNA in order to control surface&#8208;to&#8208;surface distance. It is found that the FRET efficiency does not follow the canonic F&#246;rster law, reaching 0.70 and 0.45 values for NP&#8211;NP distances&#160;of 15 and 20&#160;nm, respectively. This corresponds to the FRET efficiency decay as power four of the surface&#8208;to&#8208;surface NP&#8211;NP distance. Based on this long&#8208;distance FRET, a DNA nanoprobe is developed, where a target DNA fragment, encoding the cancer marker survivin, bringing together donor and acceptor NPs at &#8776;15&#160;nm distance. In this nanoprobe, a single&#8208;molecular recognition results in unprecedented color switch for &gt;5000 dyes, yielding a simple and fast assay with 18 attomoles limit of detection. Breaking the F&#246;rster distance limit for ultrabright NPs opens the route to advanced optical nanomaterials for amplified FRET&#8208;based biosensing.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of High&#8208;Entropy Perovskite toward Highly Sensitive and Stable X&#8208;ray Flat&#8208;Panel Detectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile and scalable mechanochemical approach is developed for synthesizing stoichiometric high&#8208;entropy perovskite. This method has been utilized to create FAMACs thick&#8208;film&#8208;based X&#8208;ray FPD, which boosts exceptional sensitivity, ultralow detection limits, remarkable spatial resolution and superior thermal robustness. This significant advancement has the potential to accelerate the progress of next&#8208;generation X&#8208;ray detectors.








Abstract
Perovskites are attracting attention for optoelectronic devices. Despite their promise, the large&#8208;scale synthesis of perovskite materials with exact stoichiometry, especially high&#8208;entropy perovskites, has been a major challenge. Moreover, the difficulty in stoichiometry control also hinders the development of perovskite X&#8208;ray flat&#8208;panel detectors. Previous reports all employed simple MAPbI3 as the active layer, while the performance still falls short of optimized single&#8208;crystal&#8208;based single&#8208;pixel detectors. Herein, a scalable and universal strategy of a mechanochemical method is adopted to synthesize stoichiometric high&#8208;entropy perovskite powders with high quality and high quantity (&gt;1&#160;kg per batch). By utilizing these stoichiometric perovskites, the first FA0.9MA0.05Cs0.05Pb(I0.9Br0.1)3&#8208;based X&#8208;ray flat&#8208;panel detector with low trap density and large mobility&#8211;lifetime product (7.5 &#215; 10&#8722;3 cm2 V&#8722;1) is reported. The assembled panel detector exhibits close&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal performance (high sensitivity of 2.1 &#215; 104 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and&#160;ultralow detection limit of 1.25 nGyair s&#8722;1), high spatial resolution of 0.46 lp/pixel, as well as excellent thermal robustness under industrial standards. The high performance in the high&#8208;entropy perovskite&#8208;based X&#8208;ray FPDs has the potential to facilitate the development of new&#8208;generation&#160;X&#8208;ray&#8208;detection systems.

By utilizing these stoichiometric perovskites, the first FA&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;MA&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;Cs&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;Pb(I&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based X-ray flat-panel detector with low trap density and large mobility&#8211;lifetime product (7.5 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) is reported. The assembled panel detector exhibits close-to-single-crystal performance (high sensitivity of 2.1 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; &#181;C Gy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and&#160;ultralow detection limit of 1.25 nGy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), high spatial resolution of 0.46 lp/pixel, as well as excellent thermal robustness under industrial standards. The high performance in the high-entropy perovskite-based X-ray FPDs has the potential to facilitate the development of new-generation&#160;X-ray-detection systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>From Nanoalloy to Nano&#8208;Laminated Interfaces for Highly Stable Alkali&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept of organic and inorganic hybrid interfaces is proposed for both Li&#8208; and Na&#8208;metal anodes, tailoring the compositions from nanoalloy structure to nano&#8208;laminated structure. The required thicknesses for nanoalloy interfaces differ from Li&#8208; to Na&#8208;metal anodes, and the mechanical stabilities of the interfaces affect electrochemical performances.









Abstract
Metal anodes are considered the holy grail for next&#8208;generation batteries because of their high gravimetric/volumetric specific capacity and low electrochemical potential. However, several unsolved challenges have impeded their practical applications, such as dendrite growth, interfacial side reactions, dead layer formation, and volume change. An electrochemically, chemically, and mechanically stable artificial solid electrolyte interphase&#160;is key to addressing the aforementioned issue with metal anodes. This study demonstrates a new concept of organic and inorganic hybrid interfaces for both Li&#8208; and Na&#8208;metal anodes. Through tailoring the compositions of the hybrid interfaces, a nanoalloy structure to nano&#8208;laminated structure is realized. As a result, the nanoalloy interface (1Al2O3&#8211;1alucone or 2Al2O3&#8211;2alucone) presents the most stable electrochemical performances for both Li&#8208;and Na&#8208;metal anodes. The optimized thicknesses required for the nanoalloy interfaces for Li&#8208; and Na&#8208;metal anodes are different. A cohesive zone model is applied to interpret the underlying mechanism. Furthermore, the influence of the mechanical stabilities of the different interfaces on the electrochemical performances is investigated experimentally and theoretically. This approach provides a fundamental understanding and establishes the bridge between mechanical properties and electrochemical performance for alkali&#8208;metal anodes.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Specific Peroxynitrite Overproduction Disrupts Metabolic Homeostasis for Sensitizing Melanoma Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiple melanoma&#8208;characteristic stimuli&#8208;triggered tumor&#8208;specific ONOO&#8722; nanogenerator with high biocompatibility is presented, serving as a potent metabolic regulator with irreversible metabolic homeostasis disruption performances of tumor cells through the S&#8208;nitrosylation modification of key metabolic enzymes for the immunosuppressive TME reversion and ICB therapy sensitization of melanoma.








Abstract
Tumor cells elicit metabolic reprogramming to establish an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) for escaping from immunosurveillance. Therefore, interrupting the metabolic adaptation of tumor cells may be a promising strategy for TME immunomodulation, favoring immunotherapy. In this work, a tumor&#8208;specific peroxynitrite nanogenerator APAP&#8208;P&#8208;NO is constructed that can selectively disrupt metabolic homeostasis in melanoma cells. Stimulated by melanoma&#8208;characteristic acid, glutathione, and tyrosinase, APAP&#8208;P&#8208;NO can efficiently generate peroxynitrite through the in situ coupling of the produced superoxide anion and released nitric oxide. Metabolomics profiling reveals that the accumulated peroxynitrite induces a great decrease in metabolites in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Meanwhile, the glycolysis&#8208;produced lactate drops sharply both intracellularly and extracellularly under peroxynitrite stress. Mechanistically, peroxynitrite impairs the activity of glyceraldehyde&#8208;3&#8208;phosphate dehydrogenase in glucose metabolism through S&#8208;nitrosylation. The metabolic alterations effectively reverse the immunosuppressive TME to evoke potent antitumor immune responses, including polarization of M2&#8208;like macrophages to M1phenotype, reduction of myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells, and restoration of CD8+ T cell infiltration. Combining APAP&#8208;P&#8208;NO with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 achieves a significant inhibition against both primary and metastatic melanomas without systemic toxicities. Collectively, a tumor&#8208;specific peroxynitrite overproduction approach is developed and the possible mechanism of peroxynitrite&#8208;mediated TME immunomodulation is explored, providing a new strategy for facilitating immunotherapy sensitivity.

         <title>All&#8208;Optical Multiplexed Meta&#8208;Differentiator for Tri&#8208;Mode Surface Morphology Observation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;optical multiplexed differentiator with a Malus metasurface consisting of single&#8208;sized nanostructures is reported. Experiments with Gaussian beams and biological specimens showcase its excellent computation performance and versatility of simultaneous outline detection and edge positioning. The approach provides a new route toward ultra&#8208;integration and multifunctionality of all&#8208;optical computing devices and the proposed meta&#8208;differentiator can find applications in various real&#8208;world scenarios.








Abstract
Current optical differentiators are generally limited to realizing a single differential function once fabricated. Herein, a minimalist strategy in designing multiplexed differentiators (1st&#8208; and 2nd&#8208;order differentiations), implemented with a Malus metasurface consisting of single&#8208;sized nanostructures is proposed, thus improving the functionality of optical computing devices without the cost of complex design and nanofabrication. It is found that the proposed meta&#8208;differentiator exhibits excellent differential&#8208;computation performance and can be used for simultaneous outline detection and edge positioning of objects, corresponding to the functions of the 1st&#8208; and 2nd&#8208;order differentiations respectively. Experiments with biological specimens showcase that boundaries of biological tissues can not only be identified, but also the edge information for realizing high&#8208;precision edge positioning is highlighted. The study provides a paradigm in designing all&#8208;optical multiplexed computing meta&#8208;devices, and initiates tri&#8208;mode surface morphology observation by combining meta&#8208;differentiator with optical microscopes, which can find their applications in advanced biological imaging, large&#8208;scale defect detection, and high&#8208;speed pattern recognition, etc.

         <title>Triggering Pt Active Sites in Basal Plane of Van der Waals PtTe2 Materials by Amorphization Engineering for Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient amorphous strategy is developed to trigger the reconfiguration of interlayer Pt atoms in 2D PtTe2 materials and tailor the electronic properties of Pt active sites via the orbital hybridization with oxygen dopants. O ur findings provide an efficient strategy for designing amorphous catalysts whose number of active sites and adsorption strength to reaction intermediates are significantly increased and optimized.








Abstract
Exposing active sites and optimizing their binding strength to reaction intermediates are two essential strategies to significantly improve the catalytic performance of 2D materials. However, pursuing an efficient way to achieve these goals simultaneously remains a considerable challenge. Here, using 2D PtTe2 van der Waals material with a well&#8208;defined crystal structure and atomically thin thickness as a model catalyst, it is observed that a moderate calcination strategy can promote the structural transformation of 2D crystal PtTe2 nanosheets (c&#8208;PtTe2 NSs) into oxygen&#8208;doped 2D amorphous PtTe2 NSs (a&#8208;PtTe2 NSs). The experimental and theoretical investigations cooperatively reveal that oxygen dopants can break the inherent Pt&#8208;Te covalent bond in c&#8208;PtTe2 NSs, thereby triggering the reconfiguration of interlayer Pt atoms and exposing them thoroughly. Meanwhile, the structural transformation can effectively tailor the electronic properties (e.g., the density of state near the Fermi level, d&#8208;band center, and conductivity) of Pt active sites via the hybridization of Pt 5d orbitals and O 2p orbitals. As a result, a&#8208;PtTe2 NSs with large amounts of exposed Pt active sites and optimized binding strength to hydrogen intermediates exhibit excellent activity and stability in hydrogen evolution reaction.

         <title>Saddle&#8208;Shaped Third Component with Out&#8208;of&#8208;Plane Electrostatic Dipole for Realizing High&#8208;Performance Photovoltaic Donor Terpolymers</title>

         <dc:description>
PM6&#8208;based terpolymers containing a saddle&#8208;shaped group with a double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) as the third component designed for fabrication of polymer solar cells feature strong out&#8208;of&#8208;plane dipole for optimizing blend morphology and improving the photovoltaic performances, thus achieving 19.13% efficiency.








Abstract
Terpolymer fabrication is an effective methodology for molecular engineering and generating high&#8208;performance organic photovoltaic materials to construct highly efficient polymer solar cells. Modification of the polymer PM6 by incorporating a third component resulting in the formation of a ternary copolymer is reported to outperform PM6 in achieving enhanced device performances. However, one of the major challenges in constructing high&#8208;performance terpolymers is to counter the molecular disorder caused by the backbone entropy induced by the third moiety. In this work, double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) is used as the third component, which possesses a&#160;strong out&#8208;of&#8208;plane electrostatic dipole owing to the saddle&#8208;shaped B&#8592;N fused ring structure. The out&#8208;of&#8208;plane dipole moment introduced in the modified PM6 terpolymer can be used as a means for tuning and optimizing the nanostructures of the blended films. The prepared PM6&#8208;BNBP&#8208;4 blend polymer with 4% of the benzodithiophene dione monomers replaced by BNBP results in excellent power conversion efficiency of 19.13%. This work demonstrates that the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane electrostatic dipole moment in saddle&#8208;shaped molecules is valuable for achieving high&#8208;performance organic photovoltaic donor materials.

         <title>Remote Water&#8208;to&#8208;Air Eavesdropping with a Phase&#8208;Engineered Impedance Matching Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phase&#8208;engineered impedance matching metasurface is designed and experimentally demonstrated that serves as an &#8220;acoustic bridge&#8221; linking water and air nearly perfectly and enables remote and efficient water&#8208;to&#8208;air eavesdropping with extreme enhancement in sensitivity. This metasurface with near&#8208;unity transmission efficiency, long monitoring distance, and high mechanical stiffness opens an avenue to communication and sensing in inhomogeneities with totally reflective interfaces.








Abstract
Efficiently receiving underwater sound remotely from air is a long&#8208;standing challenge in acoustics hindered by the large impedance mismatch at the water&#8211;air interface. Here, a phase&#8208;engineered water&#8211;air impedance matching metasurface is proposed and experimentally demonstrated for remote and efficient water&#8208;to&#8208;air eavesdropping. The judiciously designed metasurface with near&#8208;unity transmission efficiency, long monitoring distance, and high mechanical stiffness is capable of making the water&#8211;air interface acoustically transparent and, at the same time, freewheelingly patterning the transmitted wavefront. This enables efficient control over the effective spatial location of a distant airborne sensor such that it can measure underwater signals with large signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios as if placed close to the physical underwater source. Such airborne eavesdropping of underwater sound is experimentally demonstrated with a measured sensitivity enhancement of nearly 104 at 8&#160;kHz, far from achievable with the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods. Moreover, the opportunities of using the proposed metasurface for cross&#8208;media orbital&#8208;angular&#8208;momentum&#8208;multiplexed communication and underwater acoustic window are also demonstrated. This metasurface opens new avenues for communication and sensing in inhomogeneities with totally reflective interfaces, which may be translated to nano&#8208;optics and radio frequencies.

         <title>Electrochemical Doping of Halide Perovskites by Noble Metal Interstitial Cations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Control over doping of novel halide perovskite semiconductors has been a challenging research area, mainly due to the inability to directly measure and characterize defects. In this work, experimental and theoretical methods are combined to make a compelling case for the controlled, electrochemical formation of noble metal interstitial defects in halide perovskite materials, and their impact on n&#8208;type doping and optoelectronic properties is demonstrated.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites are an attractive class of semiconductors, but it has proven difficult to control their electronic doping by conventional strategies due to screening and compensation by mobile ions or ionic defects. Noble&#8208;metal interstitials represent an under&#8208;studied class of extrinsic defects that plausibly influence many perovskite&#8208;based devices. In this work, doping of metal halide perovskites is studied by electrochemically formed Au+ interstitial ions, combining experimental data on devices with a computational analysis of Au+ interstitial defects based on density functional theory (DFT). Analysis suggests that Au+ cations can be easily formed and migrate through the perovskite bulk via the same sites as iodine interstitials (Ii+). However, whereas Ii+ compensates n&#8208;type doping by electron capture, the noble&#8208;metal interstitials act as quasi&#8208;stable n&#8208;dopants. Experimentally, voltage&#8208;dependent, dynamic doping by current density&#8211;time (J&#8211;t), electrochemical impedance, and photoluminescence measurements are characterized. These results provide deeper insight into the potential beneficial and detrimental impacts of metal electrode reactions on long&#8208;term performance of perovskite photovoltaic and light&#8208;emitting diodes, as well as offer an alternative doping explanation for the valence switching mechanism of halide&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based neuromorphic and memristive devices.

         <title>X&#8208;ray&#8208;Induced Release of Nitric Oxide from Hafnium&#8208;Based Nanoradiosensitizers for Enhanced Radio&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple but multifunctional hafnium&#8208;based nanoradiosensitizer with controlled release of NO under X&#8208;ray irradiation and cGAS&#8208;STING pathway activation ability is developed for enhanced radio&#8208;immunotherapy, achieving complete elimination of cancer, especially metastasis.








Abstract
Radiotherapy (RT) is an extensively used strategy for cancer treatment, but its therapeutic effect is usually limited by the abnormal tumor microenvironment (TME) and it lacks the ability to control tumor metastases. In this work, a nanoscale coordination polymer, Hf&#8208;nIm@PEG (HNP), is prepared by the coordination of hafnium ions (Hf4+) with 2&#8208;nitroimidazole (2&#8208;nIm), and then modified with lipid bilayers containing poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). Under low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation, on the one hand, Hf4+ with high computed tomography signal enhancement ability can deposit radiation energy to induce DNA damage, and on the other hand, NO can be persistently released from 2&#8208;nIm, which can not only directly react with the radical DNA to prevent the repair of damaged DNA but also relieves the hypoxic immunosuppressive TME to sensitize radiotherapy. Additionally, NO can also react with superoxide ions to generate reactive nitrogen species (RNS) to induce cell apoptosis. More interestingly, it is discovered that Hf4+ can effectively activate the cyclic&#8208;di&#8208;GMP&#8208;AMP synthase (cGAS)&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway to promote the immune responses induced by radiotherapy. Thus, this work presents a simple but multifunctional nanoscale coordination polymer to deposit radiation energy, trigger the release of NO, modulate the TME, activate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, and finally realize synergistic radio&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>Azide&#8208;Masked Resiquimod Activated by Hypoxia for Selective Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel azide&#8208;masked resiquimod prodrug (R848&#8208;N3) is designed to block its active amino group, which can be selectively activated in hypoxic tumors. The combination of R848&#8208;N3 and polymer vascular disrupting agent (CA4&#8208;NPs) results in higher tumor selectivity than the intratumor (i.t.) injection of R848 and combination with anti&#8208;PD1 can achieve 40% tumor cure rate without obvious side effects.








Abstract
Resiquimod (R848) is an immunomodulator that causes a severe systemic inflammatory reaction due to low tumor selectivity, thus hindering its use in cancer therapy. Therefore, an azide&#8208;masked prodrug (R848&#8208;N3) of R848 is developed, which is selectively activated to R848 in hypoxic tumors. R848&#8208;N3 significantly reduces pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines in treated mice to 1/12 compared to R848 at the same dose. In addition, combretastatin A4 nanoparticles (CA4&#8208;NPs) are used to enhance the tumor selectivity of R848&#8208;N3 by elevating the level of tumor hypoxia. R848&#8208;N3+CA4&#8208;NPs has higher tumor selectivity than the intratumoral injection of R848 at 1&#160;h after administration. The concentration of the active R848 in the tumor is 21.45&#8208;fold that in the heart. Benefiting from the high tumor selectivity of R848&#8208;N3, R848&#8208;N3+CA4&#8208;NPs+anti&#8208;PD1 exerted 94.1% tumor suppression and 40.0% tumor cure. Therefore, this work highlights the potential of azide&#8208;masking strategy in the development of tumor&#8208;selective prodrugs with reduced toxicity.

         <title>Fluorescence&#8208;Amplified Origami Microneedle Device for Quantitatively Monitoring Blood Glucose</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through collaboratively integrating a microneedle patch and DNA&#8208;origami nanotubes, a fluorescence&#8208;amplified origami microneedle (FAOM) device enables the conversion from glucose to a proton signal. The proton&#8208;driven mechanical deformation of the DNA&#8208;origami structure leads to the fluorescence signal recovery. The FAOM device combines quantitative, accurate, trivially painful, and highly sensitive characteristics for real&#8208;time monitoring of blood glucose, thus improving test tolerance and patient's compliance.








Abstract
Exploration of clinically acceptable blood glucose monitors has been engaging in the past decades, yet the ability to quantitatively detect blood glucose in a painless, accurate, and highly sensitive manner remains limited. Herein, a fluorescence&#8208;amplified origami microneedle (FAOM) device is described that integrates tubular DNA&#8208;origami nanostructures and glucose oxidase molecules into its inner network to quantitatively monitor blood glucose. The skin&#8208;attached FAOM device can collect glucose molecules in situ and transfer the input into a proton signal after the oxidase's catalysis. The proton&#8208;driven mechanical reconfiguration of DNA&#8208;origami tubes separates fluorescent molecules and their quenchers, eventually amplifying the glucose&#8208;correlated fluorescence signal. The function equation established on clinical examinees suggests that FAOM can report blood glucose in a highly sensitive and quantitative manner. In clinical blind tests, the FAOM achieves well&#8208;matched accuracy (98.70&#160;&#177;&#160;4.77%) compared with a commercial blood biochemical analyzer, fully meeting the requirements of accurate blood glucose monitoring. The FAOM device can be inserted into skin tissue in a trivially painful manner and with minimal leakage of DNA origami, substantially improving the tolerance and compliance of the blood glucose test.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Soft Organogel Artificial Muscles Exhibiting High Power Density, Large Stroke, Fast Response and Long&#8208;Term Durability in Air</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A organogel artificial muscle is created through combining rational macromolecular design and twist insertion. Such tissue&#8208;like material (Young's modulus&#160;=&#160;133&#160;kPa) can generate ultra&#8208;large actuation strain (66%), ultra&#8208;fast actuation rate (275%&#160;s&#8722;1), high power density (438&#160;kW&#160;m&#8722;3), high actuation stress (0.23&#160;MPa), excellent work capacity (105&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;3), and highly stable actuation in the open&#8208;air environment.








Abstract
Polymeric gel&#8208;based artificial muscles exhibiting tissue&#8208;matched Young's modulus (10&#160;Pa&#8211;1&#160;MPa) promise to be core components in future soft machines with inherently safe human&#8211;machine interactions. However, the ability to simultaneously generate fast, large, high&#8208;power, and long&#8208;lasting actuation in the open&#8208;air environment, has yet been demonstrated in this class of ultra&#8208;soft materials. Herein, to overcome this hurdle, the design and synthesis of a twisted and coiled liquid crystalline glycerol&#8208;organogel (TCLCG) is reported. Such material with a low Young's modulus of 133&#160;kPa can surpass the actuation performance of skeletal muscles in a variety of aspects, including actuation strain (66%), actuation rate (275%&#160;s&#8722;1), power density (438&#160;kW&#160;m&#8722;3), and work capacity (105&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;3). Notably, its power density is 14 times higher than the record of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymeric gels. No actuation performance degradation is detected in the TCLCG even after air exposure for 7 days, owing to the excellent water retention ability enabled by glycerol as co&#8208;solvent with water. Using TCLCG, mobile soft robots with extraordinary maneuverability in unstructured environments are successfully demonstrated, including a crawler showing fast bidirectional locomotion (0.50&#160;mm&#160;s&#8722;1) in a small&#8208;confined space, and a roller that can escape after deep burying in sand.

         <title>pH&#8208;Triggered Size&#8208;Transformable and Bioactivity&#8208;Switchable Self&#8208;Assembling Chimeric Peptide Nanoassemblies for Combating Drug&#8208;Resistant Bacteria and Biofilms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chimeric peptide nanoassembly consisting of a 14&#8208;carbon alkyl chain unit, a &#946;&#8208;sheet&#160;and pH&#8208;responsive unit, a P. aeruginosa target recognition unit, and a hydrophilic unit is developed. The nanoassemblies exhibit good bactericidal ability in acidic environments and are able to penetrate mature biofilms and kill drug&#8208;resistant bacteria. These results provide a reference for the development of peptide&#8208;based nanomaterials.








Abstract
Drug&#8208;resistant bacteria and biofilm&#8208;associated infections are prominent problems in the field of antibacterial medicine, seriously affecting human and animal health. Despite the great potential of nanomaterials in the antibacterial field, overcoming the paradox of size and charge, efficient penetration, and retention within biofilms remain a formidable challenge. Here, self&#8208;assembling chimeric peptide nanoassemblies composed of multiple functional fragments are designed for the treatment of drug&#8208;resistant bacteria and biofilm&#8208;associated infections. Notably, the chimeric peptide self&#8208;assembles into nanofibers at pH 7.4 and is transformable into nanoparticles in the acidic biofilm&#8208;infected microenvironment at pH 5.0, and thus achieves a size reduction and charge increase, improving the penetration into the bacterial biofilms and killing drug&#8208;resistant bacteria by a mechanism dominated by membrane cleavage. In vivo mouse and piglet infection models confirm the ability of chimeric peptide nanoassemblies to reduce bacterial load within biofilms. Collectively, this research on pathological&#8208;environment&#8208;driven nanostructural transformations may provide a theoretical basis for designing high&#8208;performance antibacterial nanomaterials and advance the application of peptide&#8208;based nanomaterials in medicine and animal husbandry.

         <title>Amorphous MoOx with High Oxophilicity Interfaced with PtMo Alloy Nanoparticles Boosts Anti&#8208;CO Hydrogen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept of amorphous MoOx with high oxophilicity interfaced with PtMo alloy for efficient hydrogen oxidation/evolution reaction is reported. It is demonstrated that the weakened Had binding energy and moderate hydroxyl adsorption energy can optimize the absorption behavior of key intermediates, jointly contributing to enhanced hydrogen electrocatalysis performance.








Abstract
Advancing electrocatalysts for alkaline hydrogen oxidation/evolution reaction (HOR/HER) is essential for anion exchange membrane&#8208;based devices. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts for alkaline HOR suffer from low intrinsic activities and severe CO poisoning due to the challenge of simultaneously optimizing surface adsorption toward different adsorbates. Herein, this challenge is overcome by tuning an atomic MoOx layer with high oxophilicity onto PtMo nanoparticles (NPs) with optimized Had, OHad, and COad adsorption for boosting anti&#8208;CO&#8208;poisoning hydrogen&#8208;cycle electrocatalysis in alkaline media. For alkaline HOR, this catalyst exhibits high kinetics and an exchange current density of 3.19&#160;mA&#160;&#181;gPt&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode and 0.83&#160;mA&#160;cmPt&#8722;2, 10.3&#8208; and 3.8&#8208;fold higher than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively. For alkaline HER, it achieves an unprecedented overpotential of 37&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Experimental and theoretical studies show that the orchestrated electronic and oxophilic regulation of the PtMo/MoOx interface NPs simultaneously optimizes Had and OHad adsorption for boosting alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis, whereas reactive oxygen from the amorphous MoOx atomic layer lowers the CO oxidation reaction barrier, leading to superior anti&#8208;poisoning ability even at 100&#160;ppm CO.

         <title>Giant Electrostrain in Lead&#8208;Free Textured Piezoceramics by Defect Dipole Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A giant electrostrain value as high as 1.6% with low hysteresis and excellent fatigue resistance is achieved in textured BNT&#8208;based lead&#8208;free ceramics through the synergistic contributions of the reversible electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced phase transition, grain orientation engineering, and, foremost, defect dipole engineering.









Abstract
By converting electrical signal into mechanical displacement, piezoelectric actuators are widely used in many applications due to their precise displacement, fast response, and small size. The unipolar electrostrain values larger than 1% reported so far are from lead&#8208;based single crystals or ceramics, which brings environmental concerns. Herein, a giant unipolar electrostrain of 1.6% with good fatigue resistance and low hysteresis in Sr/Nb&#8208;doped Bi0.5(Na0.82K0.18)0.5TiO3 lead&#8208;free textured piezoceramics by defect dipole design is reported, which is comparable to or even higher than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lead&#8208;based piezoelectric single crystals. The engineered defect dipoles in ergodic relaxor ferroelectrics can introduce a large internal bias field along the poling direction, where the &#12296;111&#12297;&#8208;oriented defect dipoles with large polarizability aligning along the &#12296;111&#12297;&#8208;oriented spontaneous polarizations of the electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced ferroelectric phase greatly benefit the reversible phase&#8208;transition process of the &#12296;00l&#12297;&#8208;textured ceramic. In&#8208;depth microstructural studies reveal that the greatly enhanced electrostrain is realized by the synergistic contributions from the reversible electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced phase transition, grain orientation engineering, and most importantly, defect dipole engineering. The present research provides a general strategy for the design of piezoceramics with high electrostrain, which is expected to be promising alternative to lead&#8208;based piezoelectric actuators.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive and Mechano&#8208;Actuated Biomimetic Membrane Nanopores Self&#8208;Assembled from DNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic nanopores of complex function&#160;are built with DNA nanotechnology. The pores undergo dynamic changes in shape and can be locked in an open state by specific binding of DNA and protein stimuli, and close at high transmembrane potentials. The pores may be used in biosensing and synthetic biology.








Abstract
In bioinspired design, biological templates are mimicked in structure and function by highly controllable synthetic means. Of interest are static barrel&#8208;like nanopores that enable molecular transport across membranes for use in biosensing, sequencing, and biotechnology. However, biological ion channels offer additional functions such as dynamic changes of the entire pore shape between open and closed states, and triggering of dynamic processes with biochemical and physical stimuli. To better capture this complexity, this report presents multi&#8208;stimuli and mechano&#8208;responsive biomimetic nanopores which are created with DNA nanotechnology. The nanopores switch between open and closed states, whereby specific binding of DNA and protein molecules as stimuli locks the pores in the open state. Furthermore, the physical stimulus of high transmembrane voltage switches the pores into a closed state. In addition, the pore diameters are larger and more tunable than those of natural templates. These multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive and mechanically actuated nanopores mimic several aspects of complex biological channels yet offer easier control over pore size, shape and stimulus response. The designer pores are expected to be applied in biosensing and synthetic biology.

         <title>A Functionalized Heterogeneous Catalyst from Atomically Precise Pd1Au8 Clusters Facilitates Carbon&#8211;Carbon Bond Construction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterogeneous catalyst is synthesized by exchanging Pd1Au8(PPh3)82+ clusters into the resin, realizing time&#8208;on&#8208;stream performance for the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction. Due to the defined coordination geometry and composition and ligand of this Pd1Au8(PPh3)82+ catalyst, fundamental understanding of the structure&#8211;activity relationship can be achieved.








Abstract
It has become possible to establish a connection between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis with atomically precise metal clusters. Due to their defined coordination geometry, in this work, atomically precise Pd1Au8(PPh3)82+ clusters are exploited to identify the crucial factor that can impact the catalytic efficiency for the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling process and further gain valuable insight into the exclusive cooperative effect of the central Pd atom and the peripheral Au atoms of the Pd1Au8(PPh3)82+ cluster on controlling the cross&#8208;coupling reaction. Specifically, a heterogeneous catalyst, namely Pd1Au8@Resin, is designed by exchanging positively charged Pd1Au8(PPh3)82+ clusters into the porous resin, thereby not only facilitating catalyst recyclability when performed in a batch reactor, but also realizing time&#8208;on&#8208;stream performance for the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction carried out in a fixed&#8208;bed reactor. The integrated advantages of homogeneous complexes and heterogeneous catalysts are expected to advance the usability of atomically precise metal clusters as heterogeneous catalysts for important bond constructions in homogeneous systems.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;Solid Aqueous Electrolytes for Low&#8208;Cost Sustainable Alkali&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water molecules trapped in carcerand&#8208;like networks lead to quasi&#8208;solid aqueous electrolytes, which are compatible with alkali metals with no gas evolution, high Coulombic efficiency of over 99%, and low cost. This work paves innovative ways for water&#8208;based, low&#8208;cost, sustainable batteries, and beyond.









Abstract
Aqueous electrolytes are highly important for batteries due to their sustainability, greenness, and low cost. However, the free water molecules react violently with alkali metals, rendering the high&#8208;capacity of alkali&#8208;metal anodes unusable. Here, water molecules are confined in a carcerand&#8208;like network to build quasi&#8208;solid aqueous electrolytes (QAEs) with reduced water molecules' freedom and matched with the low&#8208;cost chloride salts. The formed QAEs possess substantially different properties than liquid water molecules, including stable operation with alkali&#8208;metal anodes without gas evolution. Specifically, the alkali&#8208;metal anodes can directly cycle in a water&#8208;based environment with suppressed growth of dendrites, electrode dissolution, and polysulfide shuttle. Li&#8208;metal symmetric cells achieved long&#8208;term cycling over 7000&#160;h (and over 5000/4000&#160;h for Na/K symmetric cells), and all the Cu&#8208;based alkali&#8208;metal cells exhibited a Coulombic efficiency of over 99%. Full metal batteries, such as Li||S batteries, attained high Coulombic efficiency, long life (over 4000 cycles), and unprecedented energy density among water&#8208;based rechargeable batteries.

Battery Recycling
In article number 2211946, Bartosz A. Grzybowski and co&#8208;workers present a one&#8208;pot separation of metals from spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Three liquid layers occupy different segments of the rotating cylindrical vessel and are intensely stirred to move selected components between layers. In only ten minutes, all cobalt and manganese migrate from the feed to the acceptor layer (red), while lithium and nickel remain in the processed feed layer (green).

Li&#8208;Ion Battery Cathodes
In article 2212098, Jaekwang Lee, Sung&#8208;Yoon Chung, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that a significant amount of oxygen loss can be induced exclusively by lattice strain even in pristine layered oxides, LiCoO2 and Li2MnO3, without any electrochemical Li extraction. Calculations based on density functional theory also clarify that shear strain, among many different modes of mechanical strain, provide a major contribution to the energetically favorable formation of oxygen vacancies, critically supporting the experimental observations.

Blood Glucose Monitoring
In article number 2208820, Qiao Jiang, Baoquan Ding, Yan Wu, Ran Liu, and co&#8208;workers describe a fluorescence&#8208;amplified origami microneedle (FAOM) device for quantitatively monitoring blood glucose. Through collaboratively integrating the advantages of fluorescence imaging, DNA origami, and the microneedle patch, the FAOM device can monitor blood glucose in real&#8208;time in a trivially painful, highly sensitive and accurate manner, thus improving test tolerance and patient compliance.

Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries
In article number 2300002, Yu Li, Chuan Wu, Ying Bai, and co&#8208;workers develop an efficient strategy to reconstruct the surface functionality of hard carbons in situ, which can controllably catalyze preferential salt decomposition to form an inorganic&#8208;rich and layered solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The structurally stable and ion&#8208;conductive SEI enables advanced hard carbon anodes with an ultrahigh initial Coulombic efficiency and long cycling life for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Interface Engineering Toward Expedited Li2S Deposition in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries: A Critical Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 29, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li2S deposition, the final discharge step contributing 75% capacity to Li&#8211;S batteries, remains a formidable issue due to its sluggish kinetics. The inferior deposition kinetics stem from the huge interfacial impedances, suggesting its interface&#8208;dominated nature. In this review, the progress and outlook of interface engineering for Li2S deposition, associated with the underlying mechanisms and potential problem&#8208;solving strategies, are reviewed.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs) with superior energy density are among the most promising candidates of next&#8208;generation energy storage techniques. As the key step contributing to 75% of the overall capacity, Li2S deposition remains a formidable challenge for LSBs applications because of its sluggish kinetics. The severe kinetic issue originates from the huge interfacial impedances, indicative of the interface&#8208;dominated nature of Li2S deposition. Accordingly, increasing efforts have been devoted to interface engineering for efficient Li2S deposition, which has attained inspiring success to date. However, a systematic overview and in&#8208;depth understanding of this critical field are still absent. In this review, the principles of interface&#8208;controlled Li2S precipitation are presented, clarifying the pivotal roles of electrolyte&#8211;substrate and electrolyte&#8211;Li2S interfaces in regulating Li2S depositing behavior. For the optimization of the electrolyte&#8211;substrate interface, efforts on the design of substrates including metal compounds, functionalized carbons, and organic compounds are systematically summarized. Regarding the regulation of electrolyte&#8211;Li2S interface, the progress of applying polysulfides catholytes, redox mediators, and high&#8208;donicity/polarity electrolytes is overviewed in detail. Finally, the challenges and possible solutions aiming at optimizing Li2S deposition are given for further development of practical LSBs. This review would inspire more insightful works and, more importantly, may enlighten other electrochemical areas concerning heterogeneous deposition processes.

         <title>Oriented Perovskite Film from Laser Recrystallization in Magnetic Field</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The orientation of crystals on the substrate and the presence of defects are critical factors in electro&#8208;optic performance. However, technical approaches to guide the orientational crystallization of electro&#8208;optical thin films remains challenging. This article reports on a novel physical method called magnetic field assisted pulse laser annealing (MAPLA) for controlling the orientation of perovskite crystals on substrates. By inducing laser recrystallization of perovskite crystals under a magnetic field and with magnetic nanoparticles, the optical and magnetic fields w ere found to guide the orientational gathering of perovskite units into nanoclusters, resulting in perovskite crystals with preferred lattice orientation in (110) and (220) perpendicular to the substrate. The perovskite crystals obtained by MAPLA exhibited significantly larger grain size and fewer defects compared to those from pulsed laser annealing (PLA) and traditional thermal annealing, resulting in improved carrier lifetime and mobility. Furthermore, MAPLA demonstrated improved device performance, increasing responsivity and detectivity by two times, and photocurrent by nearly three orders compared with PLA. The introduction of Fe2O3 nanoparticles during MAPLA not only improved crystal size and orientation but also significantly enhanced long&#8208;term stability by preventing Pb2+ reduction. The MAPLA method has great potential for fabricating many electro&#8208;optical thin films with desired device properties and stability.

         <title>Interdisciplinary&#8208;Inspired Smart Antibacterial Materials and Their Biomedical Applications</title>

Abstract
The discovery of antibiotics has saved millions of lives, but the emergence of antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria has become another problem in modern medicine. To avoid or reduce the overuse of antibiotics in antibacterial treatments, stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, pathogen&#8208;targeting nanoparticles, immunogenic nano&#8208;toxoids, and biomimetic materials are being developed to make sterilization better and smarter than conventional therapies. The common goal of smart antibacterial materials (SAMs) is to increase the antibiotic efficacy or function via an antibacterial mechanism different from that of antibiotics in order to increase the antibacterial and biological properties while reducing the risk of drug resistance. The research and development of SAMs are increasingly interdisciplinary because new designs require the knowledge of different fields and input/collaboration from scientists in different fields. A good understanding of energy conversion in materials, physiological characteristics in cells and bacteria, and bactericidal structures and components in nature are expected to promote the development of SAMs. In this review, the importance of multidisciplinary insights for SAMs is emphasized, and the latest advances in SAMs are categorized and discussed according to the pertinent disciplines including materials science, physiology, and biomimicry.

         <title>Polycrystalline Polymer Donor as Pre&#8208;Aggregate Toward Ordered Molecular Aggregation for 19.3% Efficiency Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Organic semiconductors are generally featured with low structure order in solid state films, which leads to low charge transport mobility and strong charge recombination in their photovoltaic devices. In this work, we report a &#8220;polycrystal&#8208;induced aggregation&#8221; strategy to order the polymer donor (PM6) and non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (L8&#8208;BO) molecules during solution casting with the assistance of PM6 polycrystals that were incubated through a vapor diffusion method, toward improved solar cell efficiency with either thin or thick photoactive layers. These PM6 polycrystals were redissolved in chloroform to prepare PM6 pre&#8208;aggregates (PM6&#8208;PA), and further incorporated into the conventional PM6:L8&#8208;BO blend solutions, which was found to prolong the molecular organization process and enhance the aggregation of both PM6 and L8&#8208;BO components. As the results, with the assistance of 10% PM6&#8208;PA, PM6:L8&#8208;BO solar cell devices obtained power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) from 18.0% and 16.2% to 19.3% and 17.2% with a 100 and 300&#160;nm &#8208;thick photoactive layer respectively.

         <title>Fused&#8208;ring Electron Acceptor Single Crystals with Chiral 2D Supramolecular Organization for Anisotropic Chiral Optoelectronic Devices</title>

Abstract
Supramolecular chiral organization gives &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules access to fascinating specific interactions with circularly polarized light (CPL). Such a feature enables the fabrication of high&#8208;performance chiral organic electronic devices that detect or emit CPL directly. Herein, we show that chiral fused&#8208;ring electron acceptor BTP&#8208;4F single crystal&#8208;based phototransistors demonstrate distinguished CPL discrimination capability with current dissymmetry factor (g) exceeding 1.4, one of the highest values among state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art direct CPL detectors. The theoretical calculations prove that the chirality at the supramolecular level in these enantiomeric single crystals originates from chiral exciton coupling of a unique quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional supramolecular organization consisting of interlaced molecules with opposite helical conformation. Impressively, such supramolecular organization produces a higher g along the preferred growth direction of the chiral single crystals in comparison to that of the short axis direction. Furthermore, the amplified, inverted, and also anisotropic current dissymmetry compared to optical dissymmetry has been studied by the finite element simulations. Therefore, we develop a unique chiral supramolecular organization that is responsible for the excellent chiroptical response and anisotropic electronic properties, which not only enables the construction of high&#8208;performance CPL detection devices but also allows a better understanding of the structure&#8208;property relationships in chiral organic optoelectronics.

         <title>Conversion&#8208;type Cathode Materials for Aqueous Zn Metal Batteries in Non&#8208;Alkaline Aqueous Electrolytes: Progress, Challenges, And Solutions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Aqueous Zn metal batteries are attractive as safe and low&#8208;cost energy storage systems. At present, due to the narrow window of the aqueous electrolyte and the strong reliance of the Zn2+ ion intercalated reaction on the host structure, the current intercalated cathode materials exhibit restricted energy densities. In contrast, cathode materials with conversion reactions can promise higher energy densities. Especially, the recently reported conversion&#8208;type cathode materials that function in non&#8208;alkaline electrolytes have garnered increasing attention. This is because the use of non&#8208;alkaline electrolytes can prevent the occurrence of side reactions encountered in alkaline electrolytes and thereby enhance cycling stability. However, there is a lack of comprehensive review on the reaction mechanisms, progress, challenges, and solutions to these cathode materials. In this review, four kinds of conversion&#8208;type cathode materials including MnO2, halogen materials (Br2 and I2), chalcogenide materials (O2, S, Se, and Te), and Cu&#8208;based compounds (CuI, Cu2O, Cu2S, CuO, CuS, and CuSe) are reviewed. First, the reaction mechanisms and battery structures of these materials are introduced. Second, the fundamental problems and their corresponding solutions are discussed in detail in each material. Finally, future directions and efforts for the development of conversion&#8208;type cathode materials for aqueous Zn batteries are proposed.

         <title>Enabling Scalable Polymer Electrolyte with Dual&#8208;Reinforced Stable Interface for 4.5&#160;V Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Hitherto, it remains a great challenge to stabilize the electrolyte&#8211;electrode interfaces and impede lithium dendrite proliferation in lithium metal batteries with high&#8208;capacity nickel&#8208;rich LiNxCoyMn1&#8208;x&#8208;yO2 (NCM) layer cathodes. Herein, a special molecular&#8208;level designed polymer electrolyte is prepared by the copolymerization of hexafluorobutyl acrylate and methylene bisacrylamide to construct dual&#8208;reinforced stable interfaces. Verified by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy depth profiling, there are favorable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers on Li metal anodes and robust cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) on Ni&#8208;rich cathodes. The SEI enriched in lithiophilic N&#8208;(C)3 guides the homogenous distribution of Li+ and facilitates the transport of Li+ through LiF and Li3N, promoting uniform Li+ plating and stripping. Moreover, the CEI with antioxidative amide groups could suppress the parasitic reactions between cathode and electrolyte and the structural degradation of cathode. Meanwhile, a unique two&#8208;stage rheology&#8208;tuning UV polymerization strategy is utilized, which is quite suited for continuous electrolyte fabrication with environmental friendliness. The fabricated polymer electrolyte exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 1.01 mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. 4.5&#160;V NCM622//Li batteries achieve prolonged operation with a retention rate of 85.0% after 500 cycles at 0.5 C. This work provides new insights into molecular design and processibility design for polymer&#8208;based high&#8208;voltage batteries.

         <title>Synergizing Spatial Confinement and Dual&#8208;Metal Catalysis to Boost Sulfur Kinetics in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>

Abstract
Sluggish kinetics and parasitic shuttling reactions severely impede lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery operation; resolving these issues c ould enhance the capacity retention and cyclability of Li&#8211;S cells. Therefore, an effective strategy featuring core&#8211;shell&#8208;structured Co/Ni bimetal&#8208;doped metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)/sulfur nanoparticles is reported herein for addressing these problems; this approach offers unprecedented spatial confinement and abundant catalytic sites by encapsulating sulfur within an ordered architecture. The protective shells exhibit long&#8208;term stability, ion screening, high lithium&#8208;polysulfide adsorption capability, and decent multistep catalytic conversion. Additionally, the delocalized electrons of the MOF endow the cathodes with superior electron/lithium&#8208;ion transfer ability. Via multiple physicochemical and theoretical analysis, the resulting synergistic interactions are proved to significantly promote interfacial charge&#8208;transfer kinetics, facilitate sulfur conversion dynamics, and inhibit shuttling. The assembled Li&#8211;S batteries deliver a stable, highly reversible capacity with marginal decay (0.075% per cycle) for 400 cycles at 0.2C, a pouch&#8208;cell areal capacity of 3.8 mAh cm&#8722;2 for 200 cycles under a high sulfur loading, as well as remarkably improved pouch&#8208;cell performance.

         <title>Dual&#8208;functional Perovskite&#8208;based Photodetector And Memristor for Visual Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The imitation of human visual memory, which demands the multifunctional integration of light sensors similar to the eyes, and image memory, similar to the brain. Although humans have already implemented electronic devices with visual memory functions, these devices require a combination of various components and logical circuits. With the advancement of integrated circuits, the miniaturization and high integration of devices are an inevitable trend. Therefore, the combining of visual perception and high&#8208;performance information storage capabilities into a single device to achieve visual memory remains a challenging. In this study, inspired by the function of human visual memory, we designed a dual&#8208;functional perovskite&#8208;based photodetector (PD) and memristor to realize visual perception and memory capacities. As a PD, it realized an ultra&#8208;high self&#8208;powered responsivity of 276 mAW&#8722;1, a high detectivity of 4.7&#215;1011 Jones (530&#160;nm; light intensities, 2.34 mWcm&#8722;2), and a high rectification ratio of &#8764;100 (&#177; 2&#160;V). As a memristor, an ultra&#8208;high on/off ratio (&#8764;105), an ultra&#8208;low power consumption of 3&#215;10&#8722;11&#160;W, a low setting voltage (0.15&#160;V), and a long retention time (&gt;7000 s) were realized. Moreover, the dual&#8208;functional device has the capacity to perceive and remember light paths and store data with good cyclic stability. Our device exhibits perceptual and cyclic erasable memory functions, which provide new opportunities for mimicking human visual memory in future multifunctional applications.

Abstract
5&#160;V&#8208;class LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) with its spinel symmetry is a promising cathode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the high&#8208;voltage operation of LNMO renders it vulnerable to interfacial degradation involving electrolyte decomposition, which hinders long&#8208;term and high&#8208;rate cycling. Herein, we overcome this longstanding challenge presented by LNMO by incorporating a sacrificial binder, namely, &#955;&#8208;carrageenan (CRN), a sulfated polysaccharide. This binder not only uniformly covers the LNMO surface via hydrogen bonding and ion&#8208;dipole interaction but also offers an ionically conductive cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase layer containing LiSOxF, a product of the electrochemical decomposition of the sulfate group. Taking advantage of these two auspicious properties, the CRN&#8208;based electrode exhibited cycling and rate performance far superior to that of its counterparts based on the conventional poly(vinylidene difluoride) and sodium alginate binders. This study introduces a new concept, namely &#8220;sacrificial&#8221; binder, for battery electrodes known to deliver superior electrochemical performance but be adversely affected by interfacial instability.

         <title>Grain Boundary Elimination via Recrystallization&#8208;Assisted Vapor Deposition for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells And Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Vapor deposition is a promising technology for the mass production of perovskite solar cells. However, the efficiencies of solar cells and modules based on vapor&#8208;deposited perovskites are significantly lower than those fabricated using the solution method. Emerging evidence suggests that large defects are generated during vapor deposition owing to a specific top&#8208;down crystallization mechanism. Herein, we present a hybrid vapor deposition method combined with solvent&#8208;assisted recrystallization for fabricating high&#8208;quality large&#8208;area perovskite films with low defect densities. We demonstrate that an intermediate phase can be formed at the grain boundaries, which induces the secondary growth of small grains into large ones. Consequently, perovskite films with substantially reduced grain boundaries and defect densities are fabricated. Results of temperature&#8208;dependent charge carrier dynamics show that the proposed method successfully suppressed all recombination reactions. We achieve champion efficiencies of 21.9% for small&#8208;area (0.16 cm2) cells and 19.9% for large&#8208;area (10.0 cm2) solar modules under AM 1.5 G irradiation. Moreover, the modules exhibit high operational stability, i.e., they retained more than 92% of their initial efficiencies after 200&#160;h of continuous operation.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Ii Fluorophore with Inverted Dependence of Fluorescence Quantum Yield on Polarity as Potent Phototheranostics for Fluorescence Image&#8208;Guided Phototherapy of Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic phototheranostics simultaneously having fluorescence in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8722;1700&#160;nm) window, photothermal, and photodynamic functions possess great prospects in tumor diagnosis and therapy. However, such phototheranostics generally suffer from low brightness and poor photodynamic performance due to severe solvatochromism. Herein, an organic NIR&#8208;II fluorophore AS1, which possesses an inverted dependence of fluorescence quantum yield on polarity, is reported to serve as potent phototheranostics for tumor diagnosis and therapy. After encapsulation of AS1 into nanostructures, the obtained phototheranostics (AS1R) exhibit high extinction coefficients (e.g., 68200 L mol&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 at 808&#160;nm), NIR&#8208;II emission with high fluorescence quantum yield up to 4.7% beyond 1000&#160;nm, photothermal conversion efficiency of ca. 65%, and 1O2 quantum yield up to 4.1%. The characterization of photophysical properties demonstrates that AS1R are superior to other types of organic phototheranostics in brightness, photothermal effect, and photodynamic performance at the same mass concentration. The excellent phototheranostic performance of AS1R enables clear visualization and complete elimination of tumors using a single and low injection dose. This study demonstrates for the first time the merits and prospects of NIR&#8208;II fluorophore with inverted polarity dependence of fluorescence quantum yield as high&#8208;performance phototheranostic agents for fluorescence imaging and phototherapy of tumors.

         <title>Cholesterol Metabolic Regulated Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework (HOF)&#8208;based Biotuner for Antibody Non&#8208;dependent Immunotherapy Tailored for Glioblastoma</title>

Abstract
The metabolic reprogramming of glioblastoma (GBM) poses a tremendous obstacle to effective immunotherapy due to its impact on the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Here, we develop a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOF) specifically designed for GBM immunotherapy, taking advantage of the relatively isolated cholesterol metabolism microenvironment in the central nervous system (CNS). The HOF&#8208;based biotuner regulates extra/intracellular cholesterol metabolism, effectively blocking the programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1) pathway and reducing 2B4 expression. This metabolically disrupts the immunosuppressive microenvironment of GBM and rejuvenates CD8+ T cells. Moreover, cholesterol metabolism regulation offers additional benefits in treating GBM invasion. Furthermore, in response to the tumor microenvironment (TEM)&#8208;initiated chemiexcited photodynamic therapy (PDT), which was enhanced during the regulation of cholesterol metabolism, the biotuner could effectively trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD) and increase the infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in GBM. By reversing immunosuppressive microenvironment and bolstering chemiexcited&#8208;PDT, our approach invigorates efficient antibody non&#8208;dependent immunotherapy for GBM. This study provides a model for enhancing immunotherapy through cholesterol metabolism regulation and explores the feasibility of a &#8220;metabolic checkpoint&#8221; strategy in GBM treatment.

         <title>Towards Chiral Lasing from All&#8208;Solution Processed Flexible Perovskite Nanocrystal&#8208;Liquid Crystal Membrane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Circularly polarized (CP) coherent light sources are of great potential for various advanced optical applications spanning from display/imaging to data processing/encryption and quantum communication. Here we report the first demonstration of CP amplified spontaneous emission (ASE)/lasing from a free&#8208;standing and flexible membrane device consisting of perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) and cholesteric liquid crystal layers sandwiched within a Fabry&#8208;Perot cavity architecture. The chiral liquid crystal cavity enables the generation of CP light from the device. The device is completely solution&#8208;processable, and displays CP ASE with record dissymmetry factor (glum) as high as 1.4, which is 3 orders of magnitude higher as compared with glum of CP luminescence of chiral ligand&#8208;capped colloidal PNCs. The device exhibits ultra&#8208;flexibility as the ASE intensity remains unchanged after repeated 100 bending cycles and it is stable for more than 3 months with 80% of its original intensity. Furthermore, the ultra&#8208;flexibility enabled the generation of ASE from various objects of different geometric surfaces covered with the flexible perovskite membrane device. This work not only demonstrates the first CP ASE from PNCs membrane with extremely high glum but also opens the door toward the fabrication of ultra&#8208;flexible, extremely stable, and all solution&#8208;processable perovskite chiral laser devices.

         <title>Probing Optical Multi&#8208;Level Memory Effects in Single Core&#8208;Shell Quantum Dots And Application Through 2d&#8208;0d Hybrid Inverters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Challenges in the development of a multi&#8208;level memory device for multinary arithmetic computers have posed an obstacle to low&#8208;power, ultra&#8208;high&#8208;speed operation. For the effective transfer of a huge amount of data between arithmetic and storage devices, optical communication technology represents a compelling solution. Here, by replicating a floating gate architecture with CdSe/ZnS type&#8208;I core/shell quantum dots, we demonstrate a 2D&#8208;0D hybrid optical multi&#8208;level memory device operated by laser pulses. In the device, laser pulses create linear optically trapped currents with multi&#8208;level memory characteristics, while conversely, voltage pulses reset all the trapped currents at once. Assuming electron transfer via the energy band alignment between MoS2 and CdSe, we also establish the mechanism of the optical multi&#8208;level memory effect. Analysis of the designed device led to a new hypothesis that charge transfer is difficult for laterally adjacent quantum dots facing a double ZnS shell, which we test by separately stimulating different positions on the 2D&#8208;0D hybrid structure with finely focused laser pulses. Results indicate that each laser pulse induced independent multi&#8208;level memory characteristics in the 2D&#8208;0D hybrid architecture. Based on this phenomenon, we propose a multi&#8208;level memory inverter to produce multi&#8208;level memory effects, such as programming and erasing, solely through the use of laser pulses. Finally, the feasibility of a fully optically&#8208;controlled intelligent system based on the proposed optical multi&#8208;level memory inverters is evaluated through a CIFAR&#8208;10 pattern recognition task using a convolutional neural network.

&lt;p&gt;Challenges in the development of a multi-level memory device for multinary arithmetic computers have posed an obstacle to low-power, ultra-high-speed operation. For the effective transfer of a huge amount of data between arithmetic and storage devices, optical communication technology represents a compelling solution. Here, by replicating a floating gate architecture with CdSe/ZnS type-I core/shell quantum dots, we demonstrate a 2D-0D hybrid optical multi-level memory device operated by laser pulses. In the device, laser pulses create linear optically trapped currents with multi-level memory characteristics, while conversely, voltage pulses reset all the trapped currents at once. Assuming electron transfer via the energy band alignment between MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CdSe, we also establish the mechanism of the optical multi-level memory effect. Analysis of the designed device led to a new hypothesis that charge transfer is difficult for laterally adjacent quantum dots facing a double ZnS shell, which we test by separately stimulating different positions on the 2D-0D hybrid structure with finely focused laser pulses. Results indicate that each laser pulse induced independent multi-level memory characteristics in the 2D-0D hybrid architecture. Based on this phenomenon, we propose a multi-level memory inverter to produce multi-level memory effects, such as programming and erasing, solely through the use of laser pulses. Finally, the feasibility of a fully optically-controlled intelligent system based on the proposed optical multi-level memory inverters is evaluated through a CIFAR-10 pattern recognition task using a convolutional neural network.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Crystal&#8208;structure simulation of methylthiolated peri&#8208;condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons for identifying promising molecular semiconductors: discovery of 1,3,8,10&#8208;tetrakis(methylthio)peropyrene showing ultrahigh mobility</title>

Abstract
The crystal structures of molecular semiconductors critically affect their carrier transport properties. One of the promising crystal structures that afford high carrier mobility is a brickwork structure recently reported for 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(methylthio)pyrene (MT&#8208;pyrene) showing ultrahigh mobility. However, such ultrahigh mobility was not realized in other methylchalocogenated pyrenes, owing to subtle differences in the molecular positions in their crystal structures. This means that, for developing superior molecular semiconductors, it is desirable to simulate the crystal structure with sufficient quality before time&#8208;consuming and labor&#8208;intensive synthetic trials.
To realize this, we developed a new computational approach to simulating crystal structures of all methylchalocogenated pyrenes, which was then applied to MT&#8208;pyrene&#8208;related methylthiolated peri&#8208;condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons including perylene, peropyrene, and terrylene derivatives. Among these, 1,3,8,10&#8208;tetrakis(methylthio)peropyrene (MT&#8208;peropyrene) was expected to show high mobility based on the simulated crystal structures. We thus chose MT&#8208;peropyrene as the synthetic target and developed a new peropyrene synthesis method. Thus synthesized MT&#8208;peropyrene has virtually the same crystal structure as the simulated one, and its single&#8208;crystal field&#8208;effect transistors showed mobility as high as 30 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1 and band&#8208;like transport behaviors. These results indicate that the present crystal&#8208;structure simulation is a powerful tool for exploring promising molecular semiconductors.

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Induced Spin Selectivity: An Enabling Technology for Quantum Applications</title>

         <dc:description>
Molecular spins are promising qudits but their weak interaction with external fields makes single&#8208;molecule readout challenging. A solution that exploits chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) in photoinduced electron transfer is envisioned in this work. Progress toward the detection of CISS at the molecular level by magnetic resonance is overviewed and it is shown how CISS could enable initialization, manipulation, and readout of molecular spins at high temperature.








Abstract
Molecular spins are promising building blocks of future quantum technologies thanks to the unparalleled flexibility provided by chemistry, which allows the design of complex structures targeted for specific applications. However, their weak interaction with external stimuli makes it difficult to access their state at the single&#8208;molecule level, a fundamental tool for their use, for example, in quantum computing and sensing. Here, an innovative solution exploiting the interplay between chirality and magnetism using the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity effect on electron transfer processes is foreseen. It is envisioned to use a spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion mechanism that can be realized by connecting a molecular spin qubit to a dyad where an electron donor and an electron acceptor are linked by a chiral bridge. By numerical simulations based on realistic parameters, it is shown that the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity effect could enable initialization, manipulation, and single&#8208;spin readout of molecular qubits and qudits even at relatively high temperatures.

         <title>Polarization Switching and Correlated Phase Transitions in Fluorite&#8208;Structure ZrO2 Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;dose integrated differential phase&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC&#8208;STEM) enables visualization of oxygen shifting during polarization switching and correlated polar&#8211;nonpolar phase transitions among multiple metastable phases in ZrO2 nanocrystals. Bidirectional transitions between antiferroelectric and ferroelectric orders and interfacial polarization relaxation are clarified at unit&#8208;cell scale. Meanwhile, polarization switching is strongly correlated with polar&#8211;nonpolar phase transitions among O/M/T phases.








Abstract
Unconventional ferroelectricity in fluorite&#8208;structure oxides enables tremendous opportunities in nanoelectronics owing to their superior scalability and silicon compatibility. However, their polarization order and switching process remain elusive due to the challenges of visualizing oxygen ions in nanocrystalline films. In this work, the oxygen shifting during polarization switching and correlated polar&#8211;nonpolar phase transitions are directly captured among multiple metastable phases in freestanding ZrO2 thin films by low&#8208;dose integrated differential phase&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC&#8208;STEM). Bidirectional transitions between antiferroelectric and ferroelectric orders and interfacial polarization relaxation are clarified at unit&#8208;cell scale. Meanwhile, polarization switching is strongly correlated with Zr&#8211;O displacement in reversible martensitic transformation between monoclinic and orthorhombic phases and two&#8208;step tetrahedral&#8208;to&#8208;orthorhombic phase transition. These findings provide atomic insights into the transition pathways between metastable polymorphs and unravel the evolution of polarization orders in (anti)ferroelectric fluorite oxides.

         <title>Engineered Extracellular Vesicles Derived from Dermal Fibroblasts Attenuate Inflammation in a Murine Model of Acute Lung Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered extracellular vesicles (eEVs) derived from adult dermal fibroblasts show enhanced intrapulmonary targeting and retention and can effectively deliver therapeutic cargo to the inflamed lung to reduce inflammation, mediate tissue repair, and drive metabolic changes that favor further activation of anti&#8208;inflammatory pathways. These eEVs could potentially represent a powerful tool for the treatment of acute lung injury.








Abstract
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represents a significant burden to the healthcare system, with &#8776;200&#160;000 cases diagnosed annually in the USA. ARDS patients suffer from severe refractory hypoxemia, alveolar&#8208;capillary barrier dysfunction, impaired surfactant function, and abnormal upregulation of inflammatory pathways that lead to intensive care unit admission, prolonged hospitalization, and increased disability&#8208;adjusted life years. Currently, there is no cure or FDA&#8208;approved therapy for ARDS. This work describes the implementation of engineered extracellular vesicle (eEV)&#8208;based nanocarriers for targeted nonviral delivery of anti&#8208;inflammatory payloads to the inflamed/injured lung. The results show the ability of surfactant protein A (SPA)&#8208;functionalized IL&#8208;4&#8208; and IL&#8208;10&#8208;loaded eEVs to promote intrapulmonary retention and reduce inflammation, both in vitro and in vivo. Significant attenuation is observed in tissue damage, proinflammatory cytokine secretion, macrophage activation, influx of protein&#8208;rich fluid, and neutrophil infiltration into the alveolar space as early as 6 h post&#8208;eEVs treatment. Additionally, metabolomics analyses show that eEV treatment causes significant changes in the metabolic profile of inflamed lungs, driving the secretion of key anti&#8208;inflammatory metabolites. Altogether, these results establish the potential of eEVs derived from dermal fibroblasts to reduce inflammation, tissue damage, and the prevalence/progression of injury during ARDS via nonviral delivery of anti&#8208;inflammatory genes/transcripts.

         <title>Bioinspired Processing: Complex Coacervates as Versatile Inks for 3D Bioprinting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D printable complex coacervate biomaterial inks composed of hyaluronic acid and chitosan are developed. Fine&#8208;tuning of the salt concentration, pH, and molecular weight of the polymers results in inks that are printable both in air and in water without the need for post&#8208;printing processing. Produced cell culture scaffolds are cytocompatible and show long&#8208;term topological stability.








Abstract
3D bioprinting is a powerful fabrication technique in biomedical engineering, which is currently limited by the number of available materials that meet all physicochemical and cytocompatibility requirements for biomaterial inks. Inspired by the key role of coacervation in the extrusion and spinning of many natural materials, hyaluronic acid&#8211;chitosan complex coacervates are proposed here as tunable biomaterial inks. Complex coacervates are obtained through an associative liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation driven by electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged macromolecules. They offer bioactive properties and facile modulation of their mechanical properties through mild physicochemical changes in the environment, making them attractive for 3D bioprinting. Fine&#8208;tuning the salt concentration, pH, and molecular weight of the constituent polymers results in biomaterial inks that are printable in air and water. The biomaterial ink, initially a viscoelastic fluid, transitions into a viscoelastic solid upon printing due to dehydration (for printing in air) or due to a change in pH and ionic composition (for printing in solution). Consequently, scaffolds printed using the complex coacervate inks are stable without the need for post&#8208;printing processing. Fabricated cell culture scaffolds are cytocompatible and show long&#8208;term topological stability. These results pave the way to a new class of easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle tunable biomaterials for biofabrication.

         <title>Flame Aerosol Synthesis of Metal Sulfides at High Temperature in Oxygen&#8208;Lean Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
As proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, the preparation of various metal sulfides in a flame process using single&#8208;droplet combustion and enclosed flame spray pyrolysis in O2&#8208;lean condition is demonstrated. Using a large&#8208;tube reactor MnS, CoS, Cu2S, ZnS, Ag2S, In2S3, SnS, and Bi2S3 are formed at a rate of 5 g h&#8722;1. The flame aerosol process is a key toward scalable synthesis of binary/ternary metal sulfides for next&#8208;generation functional materials.








Abstract
The development of a novel reactive spray technology based on the well&#8208;known gas&#8208;phase metal oxide synthesis route provides innumerable opportunities for the production of non&#8208;oxide nanoparticles. Among these materials, metal sulfides are expected to have a high impact, especially in the development of electrochemical and photochemical high&#8208;surface&#8208;area materials. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, MnS, CoS, Cu2S, ZnS, Ag2S, In2S3, SnS, and Bi2S3 are synthesized in an O2&#8208;lean and sulfur&#8208;rich environment. In addition, the formation of Cu2S in a single&#8208;droplet combustion experiment is reported. The multiscale approach combining flame sprays with single&#8208;droplet combustion is expected to pave the way toward a fundamental understanding of the gas&#8208;phase formation of metal sulfides in the future. The knowledge acquired can open the possibility for the development of a next&#8208;generation gas&#8208;phase technology facilitating the scalable synthesis of functional binary/ternary metal sulfides.

         <title>Stabilization of FAPbI3 with Multifunctional Alkali&#8208;Functionalized Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy to manipulate the crystallization process of FAPbI3&#8208;rich perovskite by incorporating a small amount of alkali&#8208;functionalized polymers into the antisolvent solution is reported. Rubidium&#8208;functionalized poly(acrylic acid) (Rb&#8208;PAA) significantly improves the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells to approaching 25% with enhanced operational stability.









Abstract
The defects located at the interfaces and grain boundaries (GBs) of perovskite films are detrimental to the photovoltaic performance and stability of perovskite solar cells. Manipulating the perovskite crystallization process and tailoring the interfaces with molecular passivators are the main effective strategies to mitigate performance loss and instability. Herein, a new strategy is reported to manipulate the crystallization process of FAPbI3&#8208;rich perovskite by incorporating a small amount of alkali&#8208;functionalized polymers into the antisolvent solution. The synergic effects of the alkali cations and poly(acrylic acid) anion effectively passivate the defects on the surface and GBs of perovskite films. As a result, the rubidium (Rb)&#8208;functionalized poly(acrylic acid) significantly improves the power conversion efficiency of FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells to approaching 25% and reduces the risk of lead ion (Pb2+) leakage continuously&#160;via the strong interaction between C&#63742;O bonds and Pb2+. In addition, the unencapsulated device shows enhanced operational stability, retaining 80% of its initial efficiency after 500&#160;h operation at maximum power point under one&#8208;sun illumination.

         <title>Interstitial Segregation has the Potential to Mitigate Liquid Metal Embrittlement in Iron</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic&#8208;resolution probing techniques reveal the formation of a nanoscale segregation pattern of zinc in a body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic iron grain boundary (GB) decorated by boron and carbon. Ab initio calculations show that boron and carbon hinder zinc segregation and compensate for the zinc&#8208;induced loss in GB cohesion.








Abstract
The embrittlement of metallic alloys by liquid metals leads to catastrophic material failure and severely impacts their structural integrity. The weakening of grain boundaries (GBs) by the ingress of liquid metal and preceding segregation in the solid are thought to promote early fracture. However, the potential of balancing between the segregation of cohesion&#8208;enhancing interstitial solutes and embrittling elements inducing GB de&#8208;cohesion is not understood. Here, the mechanisms of how boron segregation mitigates the detrimental effects of the prime embrittler, zinc, in a &#931;5&#8201;[001] tilt GB in &#945;&#8208;Fe (4 at.% Al) is unveiled. Zinc forms nanoscale segregation patterns inducing structurally and compositionally complex GB states. Ab initio simulations reveal that boron hinders zinc segregation and compensates for the zinc&#8208;induced loss in GB cohesion. The work sheds new light on how interstitial solutes intimately modify GBs, thereby opening pathways to use them as dopants for preventing disastrous material failure.

         <title>Understanding the Interfacial Reactions and Band Alignment for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells Built on Metal Substrates with Reduced Upscaling Losses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new understanding and architecture enabling efficient and stable perovskite solar cells built on metal substrates is presented. The efficiency and fill&#8208;factor losses due to area upscaling are remarkably reduced by one order of magnitude relative to the counterparts on conventional transparent conductive oxide (TCO) glass, highlighting an alternative pathway for upscaling and module design.








Abstract
Conventional perovskite solar cells (PSC) built on transparent conductive oxide (TCO) glass face a fundamental challenge to retain fill factor (FF) for large&#8208;area upscaling due to series resistance loss. Building a perovskite solar cell on metal has the potential to reduce this FF loss and is promising for flexible applications. However, their efficiency and stability lag far behind their TCO counterparts. Herein, findings on the complex chemical reactions and degradation&#8208;promoting processes at different perovskite/metal (Cu, Au, Ag, and Mo) interfaces, which are closely linked with the inherent stability; and the interlayer engineering for perovskite/metal interface's band alignment, which plays an essential role in achieving high efficiency, are reported. Leveraging these findings, 21% power conversion efficiency (PCE) is achieved for 1 cm2 perovskite solar cells using a p&#8211;i&#8211;n top&#8208;illumination structure on a molybdenum substrate, the highest reported for a PSC built on metal. Notably, the FF and PCE losses due to area upscaling are remarkably reduced by one order of magnitude relative to the counterparts on conventional TCO glass, highlighting an alternative pathway for PSC upscaling and module design.

Leveraging these findings, 21% power conversion efficiency (PCE) is achieved for 1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; perovskite solar cells using a p&#8211;i&#8211;n top-illumination structure on a molybdenum substrate, the highest reported for a PSC built on metal. Notably, the FF and PCE losses due to area upscaling are remarkably reduced by one order of magnitude relative to the counterparts on conventional TCO glass, highlighting an alternative pathway for PSC upscaling and module design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultralong Carrier Lifetime Exceeding 20 &#181;s in Lead Halide Perovskite Film Enable Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By regulating the electronic structure with ThFABr, an ultralong carrier lifetime exceeding 20 &#181;s and carrier diffusion lengths longer than 6.5&#160;&#181;m is achieved in 2D/3D polycrystalline perovskite films. These excellent properties enable the ThFA&#8208;based devices yielding a champion efficiency of 24.69% and a high VOC of 1.21&#160;V, coupled with significantly improved operational stability.








Abstract
The carrier lifetime is one of the key parameters for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, it is still a great challenge to achieve long carrier lifetimes in perovskite films that are comparable with perovskite crystals owning to the large trap density resulting from the unavoidable defects in grain boundaries and surfaces. Here, by regulating the electronic structure with the developed 2&#8208;thiopheneformamidinium bromide (ThFABr) combined with the unique film structure of 2D perovskite layer caped 2D/3D polycrystalline perovskite film, an ultralong carrier lifetime exceeding 20 &#181;s and carrier diffusion lengths longer than 6.5&#160;&#181;m are achieved. These excellent properties enable the ThFA&#8208;based devices to yield a champion efficiency of 24.69% with a minimum VOC loss of 0.33&#160;V. The unencapsulated device retains &#8776;95% of its initial efficiency after 1180&#160;h by max power point (MPP) tracking under continuous light illumination. This work provides important implications for structured 2D/(2D/3D) perovskite films combined with unique FA&#8208;based spacers to achieve ultralong carrier lifetime for high&#8208;performance PSCs and other optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Inhibition of Tumor Metastasis by Liquid&#8208;Nitrogen&#8208;Shocked Tumor Cells with Oncolytic Viruses Infection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A virus&#8208;concealed tumor&#8208;targeting strategy enabling oncolytic virus delivery toward lung metastasis via systemic administration is described. The virus can actively infect, be internalized, and cloak into tumor cells; then, the tumor cells are subsequently treated with liquid&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;shocking to eliminate the pathogenicity. Such a Trojan Horse&#8208;like vehicle avoids virus neutralization and clearance in the bloodstream and facilitates tumor&#8208;targeted delivery.








Abstract
Despite the superior tumor lytic efficacy of oncolytic viruses (OVs), their systemic delivery still faces the challenges of limited circulating periods, poor tumor tropism, and spontaneous antiviral immune responses. Herein, a virus&#8208;concealed tumor&#8208;targeting strategy enabling OVs&#8216; delivery toward lung metastasis via systemic administration is described. The OVs can actively infect, be internalized, and cloak into tumor cells. Then the tumor cells are subsequently treated with liquid&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;shocking to eliminate the pathogenicity. Such a Trojan Horse&#8208;like vehicle avoids virus neutralization and clearance in the bloodstream and facilitates tumor&#8208;targeted delivery for more than 110&#8208;fold virus enrichment in the tumor metastasis. In addition, this strategy can serve as a tumor vaccine and initiate endogenous adaptive antitumor effects through increasing the memory T cells and modulating the tumor immune microenvironment, including reducing the M2 macrophage, downregulating Treg cells, and priming T cells.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Light Accelerated Prodrug Reduction of Pt(IV)&#8208;Incorporating Pseudo Semiconducting Polymers for Robust Degradation and Maximized Photothermal/Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
NIR&#8208;II light accelerated prodrug reduction of Pt(IV) nanoparticles is studied&#160;by co&#8208;assembling a pseudo&#8208;conjugated&#8208;polymer with Oxa(IV) in the polymer main chain for NIR&#8208;II light phototriggered effective photothermal therapy and synergistic photoactivated chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.








Abstract
Selective activation of Pt(IV) prodrugs within tumors is particularly attractive because of their low damage to normal tissues. However, current common activation via chemical/photoreduction of Pt(IV) prodrugs into Pt(II) counterparts is limited by undesirable spatial&#8211;temporal control over this reduction process and the ineffective tissue penetration depth of undesirable light. Here, a pseudo&#8208;conjugated&#8208;polymer is designed via Stille polymerization, resulting in PSP&#8208;Pt with a Pt(IV) prodrug of oxaliplatin (Oxa(IV)) in the polymer main chain that can be activated by NIR&#8208;II light. PSP&#8208;Pt can co&#8208;assemble with a commercially available lipid polymer, namely mPEG2k&#8208;DSPE, into NPPSP&#8208;Pt. Under 1064&#160;nm light irradiation, NPPSP&#8208;Pt can be photoactivated to accelerate the Pt(IV) reduction to release oxaliplatin, thereby killing the cancer cells by photothermal effect and chemo&#8208;immunotherapy inside a mouse model with CT26 colon cancer. This work reports the application of NIR&#8208;II light for accelerating Pt(IV) reduction for cancer tumor therapy.

         <title>Giant Spin&#8208;Valve Effect in Planar Spin Devices Using an Artificially Implemented Nanolength Mott&#8208;Insulator Region</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extremely large magnetoresistance ratio is demonstrated in oxide&#8208;based lateral spin&#8208;valve devices, where a nonmagnetic nanochannel is made by implementing the metal&#8211;insulator transition in a nanoscale region of a La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 thin layer with Ar ion irradiation. The current is successfully modulated by applying the gate voltage. These are promising results for realizing oxide&#8208;based spin transistors.








Abstract
Developing technology to realize oxide&#8208;based nanoscale planar integrated circuits is in high demand for next&#8208;generation multifunctional electronics. Oxide circuits can have a variety of unique functions, including ferromagnetism, ferroelectricity, multiferroicity, superconductivity, and mechanical flexibility. In particular, for spin&#8208;transistor applications, the wide tunability of the physical properties due to the presence of multiple oxide phases is valuable for precise conductivity matching between the channel and ferromagnetic electrodes. This feature is essential for realistic spin&#8208;transistor operations. Here, a substantially large magnetoresistance (MR) ratio of up to &#8776;140% is demonstrated for planar&#8208;type (La,Sr)MnO3 (LSMO)&#8208;based spin&#8208;valve devices. This MR ratio is 10&#8211;100 times larger than the best values obtained for semiconductor&#8208;based planar devices, which have been studied over the past three decades. This structure is prepared by implementing an artificial nanolength Mott&#8208;insulator barrier region using the phase transition of metallic LSMO. The barrier height of the Mott&#8208;insulator region is only 55 meV, which enables the large MR ratio. Furthermore, a successful current modulation, which is a fundamental functionality for spin transistors, is shown. These results open up a new avenue for realizing oxide planar circuits with unique functionalities that conventional semiconductors cannot achieve.

         <title>Halides&#8208;Enhanced Buried Interfaces for Stable and Extremely Low&#8208;Voltage&#8208;Deficit Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

A simple, facile, and versatile strategy of pre&#8208;grafted halides is developed for strengthening the SnO2&#8211;perovskite buried interface, in which precise manipulation of perovskite defects and carrier dynamics has been realized by altering halide electronegativity (&#967;).








Abstract
The perovskite buried interfaces have demonstrated pivotal roles in determining both the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs);&#160;however, challenges remain in understanding and managing the interfaces due to their non&#8208;exposed feature. Here, we proposed a versatile strategy of pre&#8208;grafted halides to strengthen the SnO2&#8211;perovskite buried interface by precisely manipulating perovskite defects and carrier dynamics through alteration of halide electronegativity (&#967;), thereby resulting in both favorable perovskite crystallization and minimized interfacial carrier losses. Specifically, the implementation of fluoride with the highest &#967; induces the strongest binding affinity to uncoordinated SnO2&#160;defects and perovskite cations, leading to retarded perovskite crystallization and high&#8208;quality perovskite films with reduced residual stress. These improved properties enable champion efficiencies of 24.2% (the control: 20.5%) and 22.1% (the control: 18.7%) in rigid and flexible devices with extremely low voltage deficit down to 386&#160;mV, all of which are among the highest reported values for PSCs with a similar device architecture. In addition, the resulting devices exhibit marked improvements in the device longevity under various stressors of humidity (&gt;5000&#160;h), light (1000&#160;h), heat (180&#160;h), and bending test (10&#160;000&#160;times). This method provides an effective way to improve the quality of buried interfaces toward high&#8208;performance PSCs.

         <title>A 0D Additive&#160;for Flexible All&#8208;Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells to Go Beyond 60&#160;000 Flexible Cycles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;mechanical&#8208;durability flexible all&#8208;inorganic perovskite solar cell (PSCs) constructed by way of a 0D/3D mixed&#8208;dimensional structure is designed. The 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 additive effectively prevents the expansion of cracks during the bending process and enhances the efficiency of the all&#8208;inorganic flexible PSCs. This study provides a new route for further exploration of improving the mechanical durability of flexible all&#8208;inorganic PSCs.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic cesium lead halide flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs) exhibit superior thermal stability compared to their organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid counterparts. However, their flexibility and efficiency are still below&#8208;par for practical viability. Herein, a design using a 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 additive to transform tensile stress into compressive stress in the perovskite film, effectively preventing expansion of cracks for significantly improved mechanical durability, is reported. It is found that not only is improved flexibility obtained, but also the cell efficiency is increased for the all&#8208;inorganic flexible 3D CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx solar cells. The CsPbI2.81Br0.19 f&#8208;PSC retains over 97% of its initial efficiency even after 60&#160;000 flexing cycles at a curvature radius of 5&#160;mm (R = 5&#160;mm). Simultaneously, 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 enhances the crystallinity of the CsPbI2.81Br0.19 film and passivates the defects along the grain boundaries, effectively improving the photovoltaic performance of the all&#8208;inorganic f&#8208;PSCs. The highest power&#8208;conversion efficiency obtained is 14.25% with a short&#8208;circuit current density of 18.47&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.09&#160;V, and fill factor of 70.67%. This strategy paves the way for further improvement of the mechanical durability of all&#8208;inorganic f&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>An Overstretch Strategy to Double the Designed Elastic Stretchability of Stretchable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overstretch strategy is proposed, which is applied beyond the designed elastic range of stretchable structures after transfer printing and bonding to the soft substrate. The underlying mechanism is that the elastic range of the critical part of the stretchable structure is doubled, owing to the evolution of the elastoplastic constitutive relation during overstretching.








Abstract
Achieving or enhancing the elastic stretchability of inorganic stretchable electronics is critically significant. However, only two types of fundamental strategies&#8212;using the prestrained elastic substrate and designing the geometric layouts&#8212;are exploited thus far. This study proposes a third strategy, an overstretch strategy, applied beyond the designed elastic range of stretchable structures after transfer printing and bonding to a soft substrate. The theoretical, numerical, and experimental results collectively prove that the overstretch strategy can double the designed elastic stretchability of fabricated stretchable electronics and is valid for various geometrical interconnects with both thick and thin cross&#8208;sections. The underlying mechanism is that the elastic range of the critical part of the stretchable structure is doubled, owing to the evolution of the elastoplastic constitutive relation during overstretching. The overstretch strategy can be easily executed and combined with the other two strategies to enhance elastic stretchability, which has profound implications for the design, fabrication, and applications of inorganic stretchable electronics.

         <title>Precise Control of Single&#8208;Crystal Perovskite Nanolasers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exceptional points (EPs) are employed&#160;&#160;in precisely tuning &#160; perovskite lasing actions. By placing a nanoparticle to the boundary of a nanocavity, EPs periodically emerge as a function of the nanoparticle position: both the internal lasing actions and far&#8208;field radiation are completely reversed with a &lt;100 nm displacement. This research may find use in ultrasensitive position sensing.








Abstract
Efficient control of integrated light sources is crucial to advancing practical applications of nanophotonics. Despite the success of microlasers, their sophisticated nanostructures are not applicable in nanolasers. The situation for bottom&#8208;up&#8208;synthesized nanolasers becomes more challenging due to the constraints of fixed cavity shapes and fragile material stability. Here, the physics of exceptional points (EPs) is employed, and a strategy is demonstrated to precisely tune the lasing actions in lead halide perovskite nanorods. By placing a nanoparticle to the boundary of a square nanocavity, it is shown that EPs regularly and controllably emerge as a function of the nanoparticle position. Consequently, both the internal lasing actions and their far&#8208;field radiation can be completely reversed with a tiny displacement of &lt;100&#160;nm. The new strategy for controlling lasing actions in nanocavities is confirmed with numerical simulations and lasing experiments. This research can also bring new avenues for ultrasensitive position sensing.

         <title>A Molecular&#8208;Scale Understanding of Misorientation Toughening in Corals and Seashells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coral skeletons and nacre (left and right, respectively) have distinct structures, but they share slight misorientation of adjacent crystals, as displayed in these maps where color represents crystal orientation, and as measured in the histogram (center bottom). Synthetic spherulites, center top, spontaneously self&#8208;assemble with slight misorientation of adjacent crystals.








Abstract
Biominerals are organic&#8211;mineral composites formed by living organisms. They are the hardest and toughest tissues in those organisms, are often polycrystalline, and their mesostructure (which includes nano&#8208; and microscale crystallite size, shape, arrangement, and orientation) can vary dramatically. Marine biominerals may be aragonite, vaterite, or calcite, all calcium carbonate (CaCO3) polymorphs, differing in crystal structure.

&lt;p&gt;Coral skeletons and nacre (left and right, respectively) have distinct structures, but they share slight misorientation of adjacent crystals, as displayed in these maps where color represents crystal orientation, and as measured in the histogram (center bottom). Synthetic spherulites, center top, spontaneously self-assemble with slight misorientation of adjacent crystals.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biominerals are organic&#8211;mineral composites formed by living organisms. They are the hardest and toughest tissues in those organisms, are often polycrystalline, and their mesostructure (which includes nano- and microscale crystallite size, shape, arrangement, and orientation) can vary dramatically. Marine biominerals may be aragonite, vaterite, or calcite, all calcium carbonate (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) polymorphs, differing in crystal structure. Unexpectedly, diverse CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; biominerals such as coral skeletons and nacre share a similar characteristic: Adjacent crystals are slightly misoriented. This observation is documented quantitatively at the micro- and nanoscales, using polarization-dependent imaging contrast mapping (PIC mapping), and the slight misorientations are consistently between 1&#176; and 40&#176;. Nanoindentation shows that both polycrystalline biominerals and abiotic synthetic spherulites are tougher than single-crystalline geologic aragonite. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of bicrystals at the molecular scale reveal that aragonite, vaterite, and calcite exhibit toughness maxima when the bicrystals are misoriented by 10&#176;, 20&#176;, and 30&#176;, respectively, demonstrating that slight misorientation alone can increase fracture toughness. Slight-misorientation-toughening can be harnessed for synthesis of bioinspired materials that only require one material, are not limited to specific top-down architecture, and are easily achieved by self-assembly of organic molecules (e.g., aspirin, chocolate), polymers, metals, and ceramics well beyond biominerals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Flexible Solution&#8208;Processable Black&#8208;Phosphorus&#8208;Based Optoelectronic Memristive Synapses for Neuromorphic Computing and Artificial Visual Perception Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Cu/HfOx/solution&#8208;processable black phosphorus/Pt structure is designed and fabricated on a flexible Si substrate for neuromorphic computing and artificial visual perception. The device shows advanced synaptic features like long&#8208;term memory, short term memory, short&#8208;term potentiation, and learning&#8211;forgetting&#8211;relearning when illuminated by visible light. A 6 &#215; 6 optoelectronic synapse array is constructed and used to mimic the human visual perception and visual memory functions.








Abstract
Being renowned for operating with visible&#8208;light pulses and electrical signals, optoelectronic memristive synaptic devices have excellent potential for neuromorphic computing systems and artificial visual information processing. Here, a flexible back&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line&#8208;compatible optoelectronic memristor based on a solution&#8208;processable black phosphorus/HfOx bilayer with excellent synaptic features, toward biomimetic retinas is presented. The device shows highly stable synaptic features such as long&#8208;term potentiation (LTP) and long&#8208;term depression (LTD) for repetitive 1000 epochs, having 400 conductance pulses, each. The device presents advanced synaptic features in terms of long&#8208;term memory (LTM)/short term memory (STM), as well as learning&#8211;forgetting&#8211;relearning when visible light is induced on it. These advanced synaptic features can improve the information processing abilities for neuromorphic applications. Interestingly, the STM can be converted into LTM by adjusting the intensity of light and illumination time. Using the light&#8208;induced characteristics of the device, a 6&#160;&#215;&#160;6 synaptic array is developed to exhibit possible use in artificial visual perception. Moreover, the devices are flexed using a silicon back&#8208;etching process. The resulting flexible devices demonstrate stable synaptic features when bent down to 1&#160;cm radius. These multifunctional features in a single memristive cell make it highly suitable for optoelectronic memory storage, neuromorphic computing, and artificial visual perception applications.

         <title>Antisense Oligonucleotides Selectively Enter Human&#8208;Derived Antibiotic&#8208;Resistant Bacteria through Bacterial&#8208;Specific ATP&#8208;Binding Cassette Sugar Transporter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the challenge that the current vehicles used to deliver antisense oligonucleotides cannot distinguish between bacterial and mammalian cells, bacteria&#8208;specific ATP&#8208;binding cassette sugar transporters are leveraged to selectively internalize antisense oligonucleotides by hitchhiking them on &#945; (1&#8211;4)&#8208;glucosidically linked glucose polymers, allowing specific and efficient destruction of nearly 100% of the antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria.









Abstract
Current vehicles used to deliver antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) cannot distinguish between bacterial and mammalian cells, greatly hindering the preclinical or clinical treatment of bacterial infections, especially those caused by antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria. Herein, bacteria&#8208;specific ATP&#8208;binding cassette (ABC) sugar transporters are leveraged to selectively internalize ASOs by hitchhiking them on &#945; (1&#8211;4)&#8208;glucosidically linked glucose polymers. Compared with their cell&#8208;penetrating peptide counterparts, which are non&#8208;specifically engulfed by mammalian and bacterial cells, the presented therapeutics consisting of glucose polymer and antisense peptide nucleic&#8208;acid&#8208;modified nanoparticles are selectively internalized into the human&#8208;derived multidrug&#8208;resistant Escherichia coli and methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and they display a much higher uptake rate (i.e., 51.6%). The developed strategy allows specific and efficient killing of nearly 100% of the antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria. Its significant curative efficacy against bacterial keratitis and endophthalmitis is also shown. This strategy will expand the focus of antisense technology to include bacterial cells other than mammalian cells.

A feasible molecular&#8208;design strategy of versatile hosts, featuring a twisted 3D&#160;structure, for both donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type and multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters is proposed, which enables highly efficient solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with external quantum efficiencies nearly 30%.








Abstract
Fabricating solution&#8208;processible host material for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitter remains a formidable challenge for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this work, two new host materials, namely 3CzAcPy and 9CzAcPy, are found to exhibit high triplet energy levels, high thermal stability, and excellent film morphology from a solution process. An in&#8208;depth analysis on the photophysical data and device performance reveals the isomeric effect of the host materials has a significant impact not only on the host properties, but also on the host&#8211;dopant interactions and thus the performance of the resulting solution&#8208;processed TADF OLEDs. Impressively, the new hosts are proven to be suitable for both donor&#8211;acceptor type and multi&#8208;resonance TADF emitters, achieving state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device performance. By using the new host 9CzAcPy, solution&#8208;processed OLED based on a donor&#8211;acceptor TADF emitter of DPAC&#8208;PCN, a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 29.5% is achieved, and solution&#8208;processed narrowband OLED based on a multiple&#8208;resonance TADF emitter of BN&#8208;CP1 acquires a maximum EQE of 26.6%. These efficiencies represent the highest values among the solution&#8208;processed TADF OLEDs. This study highlights the significance of host&#8211;dopant interactions in modulating the electroluminescence performance of TADF emitters, and provides an effective design principle for solution&#8208;processible host materials.

         <title>Photofunctional Scope of Fluorescent Dithienylethene Conjugates with Aza&#8208;Heteroaromatic Cations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dithienylethenes are structurally integrated with heteroaromatic cations. The photoswitches in their ring&#8208;open forms show fluorescence in the visible spectral range, while the ring&#8208;closed isomers are non&#8208;fluorescent. This leads to ON&#8211;OFF fluorescence switching with the emission output being fine&#8208;tuned by the conjugation degree of the heteroaromatic units.








Abstract
A series of dithienylethene (DTE) photoswitches with aza&#8208;heteroaromatic cationic moieties is synthesized. The switches are characterized regarding their photochemical and photophysical properties in acetonitrile and in water. The efficiency of the switching and the photostationary state composition depend on the degree of &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the heteroaromatic systems. Thus, DTEs with acridinium&#8208;derived moieties have very low quantum yields for the ring&#8208;closing process, which is in contrast to switches with pyridinium and quinolinium moieties. All switches emit fluorescence in their open forms. The involved electronic transitions are traced back to an integrative picture including the DTE core and the cationic arms. The emission can be fine&#8208;tuned by the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the heteroaromatic cations, reaching the red spectral region for DTEs with acridinium moieties. On ring&#8208;closing of the DTEs the fluorescence is not observable anymore. Theoretical calculations point to rather low&#8208;lying energy levels of the highly conjugated ring&#8208;closed DTEs, which would originate near&#8208;infrared emission (&gt; 1200&#160;nm). The latter is predicted to be very weak due to the concurrent non&#8208;radiative deactivation, according to the energy&#8208;gap law.

     alt="Photofunctional Scope of Fluorescent Dithienylethene Conjugates with Aza-Heteroaromatic Cations"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dithienylethenes are structurally integrated with heteroaromatic cations. The photoswitches in their ring-open forms show fluorescence in the visible spectral range, while the ring-closed isomers are non-fluorescent. This leads to ON&#8211;OFF fluorescence switching with the emission output being fine-tuned by the conjugation degree of the heteroaromatic units.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of dithienylethene (DTE) photoswitches with aza-heteroaromatic cationic moieties is synthesized. The switches are characterized regarding their photochemical and photophysical properties in acetonitrile and in water. The efficiency of the switching and the photostationary state composition depend on the degree of &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-conjugation of the heteroaromatic systems. Thus, DTEs with acridinium-derived moieties have very low quantum yields for the ring-closing process, which is in contrast to switches with pyridinium and quinolinium moieties. All switches emit fluorescence in their open forms. The involved electronic transitions are traced back to an integrative picture including the DTE core and the cationic arms. The emission can be fine-tuned by the &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-conjugation of the heteroaromatic cations, reaching the red spectral region for DTEs with acridinium moieties. On ring-closing of the DTEs the fluorescence is not observable anymore. Theoretical calculations point to rather low-lying energy levels of the highly conjugated ring-closed DTEs, which would originate near-infrared emission (&amp;gt; 1200&#160;nm). The latter is predicted to be very weak due to the concurrent non-radiative deactivation, according to the energy-gap law. In essence, an ON&#8211;OFF fluorescence switching as the result of the electrocyclic ring-closing reaction is observed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polarization&#8208;Tuned Fano Resonances in All&#8208;Dielectric Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Si/Ge0.90Sn0.10 core/shell metasurface is developed to harness Fano resonance in the short&#8208;wave infrared spectral range. This resonance exploits the efficient coupling between the electric and magnetic dipoles, which is modulated with the incident light polarization. A refractive&#8208;index nanosensor is fabricated to detect a change of 10&#8722;2 unit with a sensitivity of 386 nm/RIU, despite the low quality factor.








Abstract
The short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) is an underexploited portion of the electromagnetic spectrum in metasurface&#8208;based nanophotonics despite its strategic importance in sensing and imaging applications. This is mainly attributed to the lack of material systems to tailor light&#8211;matter interactions in this range. Herein, this limitation is addressed and an all&#8208;dielectric silicon&#8208;integrated metasurface enabling polarization&#8208;induced Fano resonance control at SWIR frequencies is demonstrated. The platform consists of a 2D Si/Ge0.9Sn0.1 core/shell nanowire array on a silicon wafer. By tuning the light polarization, it is shown that the metasurface reflectance can be efficiently engineered due to Fano resonances emerging from the electric and magnetic dipoles competition. The interference of optically induced dipoles in high&#8208;index nanowire arrays offers additional degrees of freedom to tailor the directional scattering and the flow of light while enabling sharp polarization&#8208;modulated resonances. This tunablity is harnessed in nanosensors yielding an efficient detection of 10&#8722;2 changes in the refractive index of the surrounding medium.

         <title>A Universal Microscopic Patterned Doping Method for Perovskite Enables Ultrafast, Self&#8208;Powered, Ultrasmall Perovskite Photodiodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microscale patterned doping is difficult for perovskite&#160;due to its solubility to the photoresist. This problem is solved by utilizing the self&#8208;doping phenomenon of perovskite. This method is successfully realized by an ultrasmall (2 &#181;m) perovskite pn junction with satisfactory photodetector performance, which sheds light on fabricating integrated perovskite device arrays.








Abstract
Novel metal halide perovskite&#160;is proven to be a promising optoelectronic material. However, fabricating microscopic perovskite devices is still challenging because the perovskite is soluble with the photoresist, which conflicts with conventional microfabrication technology. The size of presently reported perovskite devices is about 50&#160;&#181;m. Limited by the large size of perovskite optoelectronic devices, they cannot be readily adopted in the fields of imaging, display, etc. Herein a universal microscopic patterned doping method is proposed, which can realize microscale perovskite devices. Rather than by the conventional doping method, in this study the local Fermi level of perovskite is modulated by the redistributing intrinsic ion defects via a polling voltage. A satisfactorily stable polarized ion distribution can be achieved by optimization of the perovskite material and polling voltage, resulting in ultrafast (40 &#181;s), self&#8208;powered microscale (2&#160;&#181;m) photodiodes. This work sheds light on a route to fabricate integrated perovskite optoelectronic chips.

         <title>Li&#8208;Ion Transfer Mechanism of Gel Polymer Electrolyte with Sole Fluoroethylene Carbonate Solvent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gel polymer electrolyte is in situ solidified with fluoroethylene carbonate and ester monomers to investigate the Li&#8208;ion transfer mechanism. Therein, an electron&#8208;delocalization interface layer between the solvent and the polymer matrix is formed. With lower ion&#8208;diffusion barrier, the electron&#8208;rich &#8220;Milky Way&#8221; is expected as a novel ion&#8208;transfer path, facilitating Li&#8208;ion migration.








Abstract
Although gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) represent a promising candidate to address the individual limitations of liquid and solid electrolytes, their extensive development is still hindered due to the veiled Li&#8208;ion conduction mechanism. Herein, the related mechanism in GPEs is extensively studied by developing an in situ polymerized GPE comprising fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) solvent and carbonate ester segments (F&#8208;GPE). Practically, although with high dielectric constant, FEC fails to effectively transport Li ions when acting as the sole solvent. By sharp contrast, F&#8208;GPE demonstrates superior electrochemical performances, and the related Li&#8208;ion transfer mechanism is investigated using molecular dynamics simulations and 7Li/6Li solid&#8208;state nNMR spectroscopy. The polymer segments are extended with the swelling of FEC, then an electron&#8208;delocalization interface layer is generated between abundant electron&#8208;rich groups of FEC and the polymer ingredients, which works as an electron&#8208;rich &#8220;Milky Way&#8221; and facilitates the rapid transfer of Li ions by lowering the diffusion barrier dramatically, resulting in a high conductivity of 2.47&#160;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;4&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 and a small polarization of about 20&#160;mV for Li//Li symmetric cell after 8000&#160;h. Remarkably, FEC provides high flame&#8208;retardancy and makes F&#8208;GPE remains stable under ignition and puncture tests.

         <title>A Highly Robust Amphibious Soft Robot with Imperceptibility Based on a Water&#8208;Stable and Self&#8208;Healing Ionic Conductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By precisely engineering the molecular structure and introducing cooperative ion&#8211;dipole interaction, a soft, self&#8208;healable, all&#8208;environment stable ionic conductor is developed. With this electrode material, a 50&#8208;time DEA lifetime and excellent underwater stability are achieved. Based on the synthesized electrode, the first highly robust, amphibious DEA&#8208;driven soft robot with imperceptibility is demonstrated.








Abstract
Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are widely exploited for actuating soft machines and granting soft robots with capability to operate in both underwater and on&#8208;land environments is important to make them adapt to more complex situations. Here, a DEA&#8208;driven, highly robust, amphibious imperceptible soft robot (AISR) based on an all&#8208;environment stable ionic conductive material is presented. A soft, self&#8208;healable, all&#8208;environment stable ionic conductor is developed by introducing cooperative ion&#8211;dipole interactions to provide underwater stability as well as efficient suppression of ion penetration. By tuning molecular structures of the material, a 50&#8208;time device lifetime increase compared with unmodified [EMI][TFSI]&#8208;based devices and excellent underwater actuating performance is achieved. With the synthesized ionic electrode, the DEA&#8208;driven soft robot exhibits amphibious functionality to traverse hydro&#8208;terrestrial regions. When encountering damage, the robot shows good resilience and can self&#8208;heal underwater and it also exhibits imperceptibility to light, sound, and heat.

         <title>(111)&#8208;Dominated Perovskite Films by Antisolvent Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antisolvent engineering is proposed to realize high&#8208;quality dominantly oriented perovskite film by the antisolvent of isopropyl alcohol (IPA). The interaction between IPA and PbI2 leads to the direct crystallization of (111)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 at room temperature, sidestepping the intermediates of PbI2&#8226;DMSO, FA2Pb3I8&#8226;4DMSO, and &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3. Solar cells based on (111)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 demonstrate improved performance compared to the randomly oriented perovskite films treated by other antisolvents.








Abstract
Fabricating perovskite films with a dominant crystal orientation is an effective path to realizing quasi&#8208;single&#8208;crystal perovskite film, which can eliminate the fluctuation of the electrical properties in films arising from grain&#8208;to&#8208;grain variations, and improve the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Perovskite (FAPbI3) films based on one&#8208;step antisolvent methods usually suffer from chaotic orientations due to the inevitable intermediate phase conversion from intermediates of PbI2&#8226;DMSO, FA2Pb3I8&#8226;4DMSO, and &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 to &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. Here, a high&#8208;quality perovskite film with (111) preferred orientation ((111)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) using a short&#8208;chain isomeric alcohol antisolvent, isopropanol (IPA) or isobutanol (IBA), is reported. The interaction between IPA and PbI2 leads to a corner&#8208;sharing structure instead of an edge&#8208;sharing PbI2 octahedron, sidestepping the formation of these intermediates. With the volatilization of IPA, FA+ can replace IPA in situ to form &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 along the (111) direction. Compared to randomly orientated perovskites, the dominantly (111) orientated perovskite ((111)&#8208;perovskite) exhibits improved carrier mobility, uniform surface potential, suppressed film defects and enhanced photostability. PSCs based on the (111)&#8208;perovskite films show 22% power conversion efficiency and excellent stability, which remains unchanged after 600&#160;h continuous working at maximum power point, and 95% after 2000&#160;h of storage in atmosphere environment.

         <title>Pollen&#8208;Inspired Adhesive Multilobe Microparticles from Microfluidics for Intestinal Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peony&#8208;pollen&#8208;inspired multilobe microparticles are designed for target surface adhesion and durable drug release via microfluidic electrospray technology and hydrogel selective degradation. By loading dexamethasone inside, these microparticles show excellent adhesion ability and anti&#8208;inflammatory property in treating rats with inflammatory bowel disease.








Abstract
Microparticles (MPs)&#8208;based delivery systems have a demonstrated value in gastrointestinal administration. Research in this area is focusing on the development of multifunctional MPs to improve delivery effects. Herein, learning from the natural morphology of peony pollens, novel multilobe MPs delivery systems for target surface adhesion and durable drug release are pesented. Ascribing to the flexibility of microfluidic technology and the combination of selective hydrogel degradation methods, MPs with a series of multilobe structures can be obtained using alginate and methacrylated gelatin. Compared with spherical MPs, these multilobe MPs are elucidated to show excellent adhesion capacity due to their enhanced contact area. By encapsulating anti&#8208;inflammatory agent dexamethasone (DXM) into their matrix hydrogel, the resultant multilobe MPs delivery systems are verified to feature durable drug&#8208;release property and anti&#8208;inflammatory efficacy, which is further demonstrated in rats with inflammatory bowel disease. These results indicated that the biomimetic multilobe MPs are potentially ideal adhesive and durable drug&#8208;delivery vehicles for gastrointestinal drug administrations.

         <title>Metasurface&#8208;Enhanced Mid&#8208;Infrared Spectrochemical Imaging of Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metasurface&#8208;enhanced mid&#8208;infrared spectral tissue imaging method is developed to advance quantitative functional biomolecule mapping in brain tissue sections. Probing nanoscale tissue volumes via metasurface&#8208;localized strong electromagnetic fields, this imaging modality isolates the molecular composition information from the bulk physical properties of the tissue sections. The approach increases the sensitivity and selectivity of molecular fingerprint retrieval enhancing the chemical image contrast and enabling detection of ultrathin tissue regions.









Abstract
Label&#8208;free and nondestructive mid&#8208;infrared vibrational hyperspectral imaging is an essential tissue analysis tool, providing spatially resolved biochemical information critical to understanding physiological and pathological processes. However, the chemically complex and spatially heterogeneous composition of tissue specimens and the inherently weak interaction of infrared light with biomolecules limit the analytical performance of infrared absorption spectroscopy. Here, an advanced mid&#8208;infrared spectrochemical tissue imaging modality is introduced using metasurfaces that support strong surface&#8208;localized electromagnetic fields to capture quantitative molecular maps of large&#8208;area murine brain tissue sections. The approach leverages polarization&#8208;multiplexed multi&#8208;resonance plasmonic metasurfaces to simultaneously detect various functional biomolecules. The surface&#8208;enhanced mid&#8208;infrared spectral imaging method eliminates the non&#8208;specific effects of bulk tissue morphology on quantitative spectral analysis and improves chemical selectivity. This study shows that metasurface enhancement increases the retrieval of amide I and II bands associated with protein secondary structures. Moreover, it is demonstrated that plasmonic metasurfaces enhance the chemical contrast in infrared images and enable detection of ultrathin tissue regions that are not otherwise visible to conventional mid&#8208;infrared spectral imaging. While this work uses murine brain tissue sections, the&#160;chemical imaging method is well&#8208;suited for other tissue types, which broadens its potential impact for translational research and clinical histopathology.

         <title>Reversing Acute Kidney Injury through Coordinated Interplay of Anti&#8208;Inflammation and Iron Supplementation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasmall nicotinamide&#8208;mononucleotide&#8208;modified Fe3O4 (Fe3O4@NMN) nanoprobe with renal targeting ability has been constructed for reversing AKI through instant release of NMN and slow degradation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The upregulation of the erythropoietin level as well as the iron level in bone marrow is demonstrated to promote the generation of red blood cells, which plays a key role in accelerating renal recovery.








Abstract
Acute kidney injury (AKI) induced by ischemia reperfusion is closely related to mitochondrial dysfunction. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) can enhance the mitochondrial function and restrain the following inflammation, but it is hardly delivered and lacks renal targeting ability. To address these problems, herein, an ultrasmall Fe3O4 nanoparticle is used as a carrier to deliver nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a precursor of NAD+. An outstanding sophistication of the current design is that once NMN is attached on the surface of Fe3O4 nanoparticles through its phosphate group, the remaining part is structurally highly similar to nicotinamide riboside, which provides an opportunity to deliver the NAD+ precursor into renal cells through nicotinamide riboside kinase 1 on the cell membrane. It is demonstrated that NMN&#8208;loaded Fe3O4 nanoparticles can effectively reverse AKI induced by ischemia reperfusion. In&#8208;depth studies indicate that a well&#8208;timed iron replenishment following anti&#8208;inflammation treatment plays a determined role in recovering AKI, which distinguishes the current study from previous strategies centering on anti&#8208;ROS (reactive oxygen species), anti&#8208;inflammation, or even iron elimination.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Enriched Hollow Porous Carbon Nanocages Enable Highly Efficient Chlorine Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow porous carbon (HPC) nanocages with a controlled oxygen electronic state around the designed carbon defects are fabricated through a hard template strategy for the electrocatalytic chlorine evolution reaction (CER). The electron density around the unsaturated O atoms can be decreased on the minor defects in carbon which is favorable for the adsorption of Cl&#8722;. The optimum HPC nanocages with lowest defective degree show excellent electrocatalytic performance for the CER.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based catalysts are crucial for the electrocatalytic chlorine evolution reaction (CER) to reduce the usage of noble metals and industrial cost. However, the corresponding catalytic activity of high overpotential and low durability hinders their wide application. Here, a hollow porous carbon (HPC) nanocage with a controlled oxygen electronic state around designed carbon defects for CER activity is reported. Alkali etching can bring defects in zeolite with a hollow structure. In a hard template strategy, the type of carbon defects is directly related to etching degree of the zeolite template. More importantly, the oxygen atoms can be &#8220;borrowed&#8221; from the zeolite framework by the defective carbon. The electron density around unsaturated O atoms can be decreased on the minor defects in carbon compared with that on large defects which is favorable for the adsorption of Cl&#8722;. Consequently, the as&#8208;synthesized HPC nanocages with minor defects show excellent electrocatalytic performance for CER with a low overpotential of 94&#160;mV at current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with good stability, which is superior to the commercial precious metal catalyst of dimensionally stable anode (DSA), and the best in the reported carbon materials. The designed carbon materials provide an option for metal&#8208;free industrial catalysts with significant CER activities.

         <title>Universal Renaissance Strategy of Metal Fluoride in Secondary Ion Batteries Enabled by Liquid Metal Gallium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic limitations of metal fluorides can be solved by simply introducing GaF3. The in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated liquid Ga provides highly conformable ion/electron&#8208;transport networks, while doped Ga in the LiF crystal structure activates Li&#63743;F splitting. The lithium&#8208;ion storage capacity of MnF2 can be significantly increased by 87%, while the sodium&#8208;ion storage capacity of FeF3 can be increased by 33%.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state alkali ion batteries represent a future trend in battery technology, as well as provide an opportunity for low&#8208;cost metal fluoride electrode materials, if certain intrinsic problems can be resolved. In this work, a liquid metal activation strategy is proposed in which liquid Ga elements are generated in situ and doped into the LiF crystal structure by introducing a small amount of GaF3. Benefiting from these two Ga states of existence, in which the liquid metal Ga can continuously maintain conformable ion/electron&#8208;transport networks, while doped Ga in the LiF crystal structure catalyzes Li&#63743;F splitting, the lithium&#8208;ion storage capacity of MnF2 significantly increases&#160;by 87%. A similar effect can be obtained in FeF3, where the sodium&#8208;ion storage capacity is enhanced by 33%. This universal strategy with few restrictions can be used to realize a complete renaissance of metal fluorides, as well as offer an opportunity for the new application of liquid metals in the field of energy storage.

         <title>An Amphiphilic Entangled Network Design Toward Ultratough Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphiphilic hydrogels with ultrahigh toughness and durability are prepared by mixing a hydrophobic polymer into a hydrophilic matrix. Fine crystallites stiffen the network, which can endure long&#8208;term shear. Dense chain entanglements enable large tensile deformation with low hysteresis. The resulting gels can retain both hydrophilic and lipophilic molecules.








Abstract
Hydrogels find important roles in biomedicine, wearable electronics, and soft robotics, but their mechanical properties are often unsatisfactory. Conventional tough hydrogel designs are based on hydrophilic networks with sacrificial bonds, while the incorporation of hydrophobic polymers into hydrogels is less well understood. In this work, a hydrogel toughening strategy is demonstrated by introducing a hydrophobic polymer as reinforcement. Semicrystalline hydrophobic polymer chains are &#8220;woven&#8221; into a hydrophilic network via entropy&#8208;driven miscibility. In&#8208;situ&#8208;formed sub&#8208;micrometer crystallites stiffen the network, while entanglements between hydrophobic polymer and hydrophilic network enable large deformation before failure. The hydrogels are stiff, tough, and durable at high swelling ratios of 6&#8211;10, and the mechanical properties are tunable. Moreover, they can effectively encapsulate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules.

         <title>Sequential Co&#8208;Passivation in InAs Colloidal Quantum Dot Solids Enables Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To improve the passivation of III&#8208;V InAs quantum dots, this work designs a sequential co&#8208;passivation ligand exchange strategy involving Z&#8208;type, InBr3, and X&#8208;type methylammonium acetate. The application of sequential co&#8208;passivation dots to near&#8208;infrared photodetectors produces photodetectors with an external quantum efficiency of 37%, which is 20% better than the current best.








Abstract
III&#8208;V colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are promising materials for optoelectronic applications, for they avoid heavy metals while achieving absorption spanning the visible to the infrared (IR). However, the covalent nature of III&#8208;V CQDs requires the development of new passivation strategies to fabricate conductive CQD solids for optoelectronics: this work shows herein that ligand exchanges, previously developed in II&#8208;VI and IV&#8208;VI quantum dots and employing a single ligand, do not fully passivate CQDs, and that this curtails device efficiency. Guided by density functional theory (DFT) simulations, this work develops a co&#8208;passivation strategy to fabricate indium arsenide CQD photodetectors, an approach that employs the combination of X&#8208;type methyl ammonium acetate (MaAc) and Z&#8208;type ligands InBr3. This approach maintains charge carrier mobility and improves passivation, seen in a 25% decrease in Stokes shift, a fourfold reduction in the rate of first&#8208;exciton absorption linewidth broadening over time&#8208;under&#8208;stress, and leads to a doubling in photoluminescence (PL) lifetime. The resulting devices show 37% external quantum efficiency (EQE) at 950&#160;nm, the highest value reported for InAs CQD photodetectors.

         <title>Achieving Tunable Organic Afterglow and UV&#8208;Irradiation&#8208;Responsive Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Pyridine&#8208;Substituted Triphenylamine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of polymer&#8208;based room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials with ultralong lifetime, tunable afterglow, and UV&#8208;irradiation response is developed by simply doping pyridine&#8208;substituted TPA derivatives into the poly(vinyl alcohol) PVA and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) polymer matrixes, respectively. Diversified encryption patterns are fabricated to demonstrate the potential applications of these doping PVA and PMMA systems in multilevel anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption technologies.








Abstract
Amorphous polymers with ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are highly promising for various applications. Particularly, polymer&#8208;based RTP materials with multiple functions such as color&#8208;tunability or stimulus&#8208;response are highly desirable for multilevel anti&#8208;counterfeiting but are rarely reported. Herein, a facile strategy is presented to achieve a series of polymer&#8208;based RTP materials with ultralong lifetime, multicolor afterglow, and reversible response to UV irradiation by simply embedding pyridine&#8208;substituted triphenylamine derivatives into the polymer matrix poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), respectively. Notably, the pyridine group with the capabilities of promoting intersystem crossing and forming hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions is essential for triggering ultralong RTP from the doping PVA system, among which the doping film TPA&#8208;2Py@PVA exhibits excellent RTP property with an ultralong lifetime of 798.4&#160;ms and a high quantum yield of 15.2%. By further co&#8208;doping with the commercially available fluorescent dye, multicolor afterglow is obtained via phosphorescence energy transfer. Meanwhile, the doped PMMA system exhibits reversible photoactivated ultralong RTP properties under continuous UV irradiation. Finally, potential applications of these doped PVA and PMMA systems with ultralong lifetime, multicolor afterglow, and photoactivated ultralong RTP in multidimensional anti&#8208;counterfeiting are demonstrated.

     alt="Achieving Tunable Organic Afterglow and UV-Irradiation-Responsive Ultralong Room-Temperature Phosphorescence from Pyridine-Substituted Triphenylamine Derivatives"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of polymer-based room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials with ultralong lifetime, tunable afterglow, and UV-irradiation response is developed by simply doping pyridine-substituted TPA derivatives into the poly(vinyl alcohol) PVA and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) polymer matrixes, respectively. Diversified encryption patterns are fabricated to demonstrate the potential applications of these doping PVA and PMMA systems in multilevel anti-counterfeiting and information encryption technologies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amorphous polymers with ultralong room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are highly promising for various applications. Particularly, polymer-based RTP materials with multiple functions such as color-tunability or stimulus-response are highly desirable for multilevel anti-counterfeiting but are rarely reported. Herein, a facile strategy is presented to achieve a series of polymer-based RTP materials with ultralong lifetime, multicolor afterglow, and reversible response to UV irradiation by simply embedding pyridine-substituted triphenylamine derivatives into the polymer matrix poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), respectively. Notably, the pyridine group with the capabilities of promoting intersystem crossing and forming hydrogen-bonding interactions is essential for triggering ultralong RTP from the doping PVA system, among which the doping film TPA-2Py@PVA exhibits excellent RTP property with an ultralong lifetime of 798.4&#160;ms and a high quantum yield of 15.2%. By further co-doping with the commercially available fluorescent dye, multicolor afterglow is obtained via phosphorescence energy transfer. Meanwhile, the doped PMMA system exhibits reversible photoactivated ultralong RTP properties under continuous UV irradiation. Finally, potential applications of these doped PVA and PMMA systems with ultralong lifetime, multicolor afterglow, and photoactivated ultralong RTP in multidimensional anti-counterfeiting are demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exploring Electronic Characteristics of Acceptor&#8211;Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8208;Type Molecules by Single&#8208;Molecule Charge Transport</title>

         <dc:description>
Through single&#8208;molecule detection, it is found that an acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8211;D&#8211;A)&#8208;type molecule with 1,1&#8208;dicyano methylene&#8208;3&#8208;indanone acceptor units exhibits enhanced conductance compared with the control donor molecule. Furthermore, the charge transport of the D central part is directly detected, proving that the conductive orbitals contributed by the acceptor groups can penetrate the whole A&#8211;D&#8211;A molecule.








Abstract
The electronic characteristics of organic optoelectronic materials determine the performance of corresponding devices. Clarifying the relationship between molecular structure and electronic characteristics at the single&#8208;molecule level can help to achieve high performance for organic optoelectronic materials and devices, especially for organic photovoltaics. In this work, a typical acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8211;D&#8211;A)&#8208;type molecule is explored by combining theoretical and experimental studies to reveal the intrinsic electronic characteristics at the single&#8208;molecule level. Specifically, the A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8208;type molecule with 1,1&#8208;dicyano methylene&#8208;3&#8208;indanone (INCN) acceptor units exhibits an enhanced conductance in single&#8208;molecule junctions when compared with the control donor molecule, because the acceptor units of the A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8208;type molecule contribute additional transport channels. In addition, through opening the S&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O noncovalent conformational lock by protonation to expose the &#8722;S anchoring sites, the charge transport of the D central part is detected, proving that the conductive orbitals contributed by the INCN acceptor groups can penetrate the whole A&#8211;D&#8211;A molecule. These results provide important insights into the development of high&#8208;performance organic optoelectronic materials and devices toward practical applications.

         <title>Constructing an Interfacial Gradient Heterostructure Enables Efficient CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells and Printed Minimodules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interfacial gradient heterostructure (denoted as BTA+&#8208;CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx) is constructed to simultaneously tune CsPbI3 perovskite defects and interfacial energy levels. This strategy can significantly suppress nonradiative recombination in perovskites and facilitate charge transfer in a device. An efficiency of 21.31% is achieved for CsPbI3 solar cells, and a record efficiency of 16.60% is demonstrated for printed inorganic CsPbI3 minimodules.








Abstract
Severe nonradiative recombination originating from interfacial defects together with the pervasive energy level mismatch at the interface remarkably limits the performance of CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs). These issues need to be addressed urgently for high&#8208;performance cells and their applications. Herein, an interfacial gradient heterostructure based on low&#8208;temperature post&#8208;treatment of quaternary bromide salts for efficient CsPbI3 PSCs with an impressive efficiency of 21.31% and an extraordinary fill factor of 0.854 is demonstrated. Further investigation reveals that Br&#8722; ions diffuse into the perovskite films to heal undercoordinated Pb2+ and inhibit Pb cluster formation, thus suppressing nonradiative recombination in CsPbI3. Meanwhile, a more compatible interfacial energy level alignment resulting from Br&#8722; gradient distribution and organic cations surface termination is also achieved, hence promoting charge separation and collection. Consequently, the printed small&#8208;size cell with an efficiency of 20.28% and 12 cm2 printed CsPbI3 minimodules with a record efficiency of 16.60% are also demonstrated. Moreover, the unencapsulated CsPbI3 films and devices exhibit superior stability.

         <title>Non&#8208;Toxic CuInS2/ZnS Colloidal Quantum Dots for Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of CuInS2/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) with a high photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) of 65% at 920 nm is reported. Notably, the synthesis employs a supplementary S precursor, hexamethyldisilathiane (HMDS), which gives rise to better size homogeneity and an improvement in PLQE. Implementation of the QDs in a light&#8208;emitting device gives an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.2%.








Abstract
Ternary CuInS2 quantum dots (QDs) with photoluminescence that is tunable from the visible to the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region are promising light&#8208;emitters for consumer electronics due to the absence of toxic elements such as Pb, Cd, or As. Despite the compelling performance of visible&#8208;light&#8208;emitting CuInS2 QDs, reports on NIR emission remain limited, with modest efficiencies at wavelengths beyond 900&#160;nm. In this work, the facile synthesis of NIR&#8208;emitting CuInS2/ZnS QDs is reported. A combination of two&#160;sulfur precursors w as used in the synthesis, comprising 1&#8208;dodecanethiol (DDT) and hexamethyldisilathiane (HMDS). The reactive HMDS facilitates faster nucleation and leads to a higher density of emissive Cu&#8208;deficiency sites. The resulting QDs exhibit high photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) of 65% at a long emission wavelength of 920&#160;nm. Using these QDs, NIR light&#8208;emitting diodes (LED) are fabricated, which attain an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.2%. This efficiency is comparable to the best reported PbS and InAs QD LEDs, and the emission wavelength exceeds that of lead iodide perovskites. This work thus marks one of the first reports of efficient NIR LEDs based on environmentally benign CuInS2 QDs and may open up promising new applications in consumer electronic products.

         <title>Over 18% Efficiency of All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with Long&#8208;Term Stability Enabled by Y6 as a Solid Additive</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small amount of Y6 (2 wt%) as a solid additive is introduced intoPM6:PY&#8208;DT blend. Y6 can remain inside the active layer and interact with PY&#8208;DT to form a well&#8208;mixed phase. Increased molecular packing, enlarged phase separation, and decreased trap density in the Y6&#8208;processed blend result in a high efficiency over 18% and excellent long&#8208;term stability with a T80 lifetime of 1180&#160;h.








Abstract
Morphology control greatly influences the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and long&#8208;term stability of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs); however, it remains challenging owing to their complex crystallization behavior. Herein, a small amount of Y6 (2 wt%) is introduced as a solid additive into a PM6:PY&#8208;DT blend. Y6 remained inside the active layer and interacted with PY&#8208;DT to form a well&#8208;mixed phase. Increased molecular packing, enlarged phase separation size, and decreased trap density are observed for the Y6&#8208;processed PM6:PY&#8208;DT blend. The corresponding devices showed simultaneously improved short&#8208;circuit current and fill factor, achieving a high PCE of over 18% and excellent long&#8208;term stability, with a T80 lifetime of 1180&#160;h and an extrapolated T70 lifetime of 9185&#160;h at maximum power point tracking (MPP) conditions under continuous one&#8208;sun illumination. This Y6&#8208;assisted strategy is successfully applied to other all&#8208;polymer blends, demonstrating its universality for all&#8208;PSCs. This work paves a new way for the fabrication of all&#8208;PSCs with high efficiency and superior long&#8208;term stability.

&lt;p&gt;A small amount of Y6 (2 wt%) as a solid additive is introduced intoPM6:PY-DT blend. Y6 can remain inside the active layer and interact with PY-DT to form a well-mixed phase. Increased molecular packing, enlarged phase separation, and decreased trap density in the Y6-processed blend result in a high efficiency over 18% and excellent long-term stability with a &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morphology control greatly influences the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and long-term stability of all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs); however, it remains challenging owing to their complex crystallization behavior. Herein, a small amount of Y6 (2 wt%) is introduced as a solid additive into a PM6:PY-DT blend. Y6 remained inside the active layer and interacted with PY-DT to form a well-mixed phase. Increased molecular packing, enlarged phase separation size, and decreased trap density are observed for the Y6-processed PM6:PY-DT blend. The corresponding devices showed simultaneously improved short-circuit current and fill factor, achieving a high PCE of over 18% and excellent long-term stability, with a &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt; lifetime of 1180&#160;h and an extrapolated &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt; lifetime of 9185&#160;h at maximum power point tracking (MPP) conditions under continuous one-sun illumination. This Y6-assisted strategy is successfully applied to other all-polymer blends, demonstrating its universality for all-PSCs. This work paves a new way for the fabrication of all-PSCs with high efficiency and superior long-term stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluoride&#8208;Catalyzed Siloxane Exchange as a Robust Dynamic Chemistry for High&#8208;Performance Vitrimers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluoride&#8208;catalyzed siloxane exchange is an exceptionally robust chemistry for scalable production of high&#8208;performance vitrimers through reactive extrusion of commodity polymers such as poly(methyl methacrylate), polyethylene, and polypropylene. The vitrimers show improved resistance to creep, heat, oxidation, and hydrolysis, while maintaining excellent processability. Furthermore, the siloxane exchange between different vitrimers during mechanical blending results in self&#8208;compatibilized blends without any compatibilizers.








Abstract
Sustainable development of new technologies requires materials having advanced physical and chemical properties while maintaining reprocessability and recyclability. Vitrimers are designed for this purpose; however, their dynamic covalent chemistries often have drawbacks or are limited to specialized polymers. Here, fluoride&#8208;catalyzed siloxane exchange is reported as an exceptionally robust chemistry for scalable production of high&#8208;performance vitrimers through industrial processing of commodity polymers such as poly(methyl methacrylate), polyethylene, and polypropylene. The vitrimers show improved resistance to creep, heat, oxidation, and hydrolysis, while maintaining excellent melt flow for processing and recycling. Furthermore, the siloxane exchange between different vitrimers during mechanical blending results in self&#8208;compatibilized blends without any compatibilizers. This offers a general, scalable method for producing sustainable high&#8208;performance vitrimers and a new strategy for recycling mixed plastic wastes.

         <title>Improving the Performance of Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Processed Organic Solar Cells via Introducing a Wide&#8208;Bandgap Dopant into the Upper Acceptor Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wide&#8208;bandgap polymer poly(9&#8208;vinylcarbazole) (PVK) is added to the acceptor layer of layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer organic solar cells (OSCs). Besides enhancing molecular stacking, PVK n&#8208;dopes the electron acceptor, increases the electron concentration, and improves charge transport, leading to elevated power conversion efficiency in OSCs, especially for the D18/L8&#8208;BO active layer which demonstrates device efficiency over 19% with PVK addition.








Abstract
The layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) solution&#8208;processed organic solar cells (OSCs) are conductive to achieve vertical phase separation, tunable donor&#8211;acceptor (D/A) interfaces, and favorable charge&#8208;transport pathways. In this work, a wide&#8208;bandgap component poly(9&#8208;vinylcarbazole) (PVK) is added to the upper electron acceptor layer to improve the performance of LbL&#8208;processed OSCs. Results show that the PVK component can adjust the film morphology, dope the electron acceptor, increase the electron concentration, and improve charge transport. Such n&#8208;type doping is verified by Seebeck coefficient measurement, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, and electron paramagnetic resonance characterization. In addition, the fluorescence intensity and exciton lifetime of the PVK&#8208;doped acceptor film are increased, thus being beneficial for exciton diffusion to the D/A interface. Therefore, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of LbL OSCs increases when 2.50 wt.% PVK is employed in the electron acceptor layer of commonly&#8208;used high&#8208;efficiency system and a maximum value of 19.05% can be achieved. The role of PVK played in the active layer is different from those of additives and ternary components reported previously, so the results provide an alternative way to enhance the device performance of LbL&#8208;processed OSCs.

         <title>Inorganic Perovskite Surface Reconfiguration for Stable Inverted Solar Cells with 20.38% Efficiency and Its Application in Tandem Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward method involves utilizing 2&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;bromobenzamide (ABA) to fabricate efficient inorganic perovskite solar cells (IPSCs) by reconfiguring the surface properties of CsPbI2.85Br0.15 film. A record&#8208;breaking efficiency of 20.38% for p&#8211;i&#8211;n single&#8208;junction IPSCs is obtained. Furthermore, an inorganic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell is successfully demonstrated, with an impressive efficiency of 25.31%.








Abstract
Inorganic perovskite solar cells (IPSCs) have garnered attention in tandem solar cells (TSCs) due to their suitable bandgap and impressive thermal stability. However, the efficiency of inverted IPSCs has been limited by the high trap density on the top surface of inorganic perovskite film. Herein, a method for fabricating efficient IPSCs by reconfiguring the surface properties of CsPbI2.85Br0.15 film with 2&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;bromobenzamide (ABA) is developed. This modification not only exhibits the synergistic coordination of carbonyl (C=O) and amino (NH2) groups with uncoordinated Pb2+, but also the Br fills halide vacancies and suppresses the formation of Pb0, effectively passivating the defective top surface. As a result, a champion efficiency of 20.38%, the highest efficiency reported for inverted IPSCs to date is achieved. Furthermore, the successful fabrication of a p&#8211;i&#8211;n type monolithic inorganic perovskite/silicon TSCs with an efficiency of 25.31% for the first time is demonstrated. Crucially, the unencapsulated ABA&#8208;treated IPSCs shows enhanced photostability, retaining 80.33% of its initial efficiency after 270&#160;h, and thermal stability (maintain 85.98% of its initial efficiency after 300&#160;h at 65&#160;&#176;C). The unencapsulated ABA&#8208;treated TSCs also retains 92.59% of its initial efficiency after 200&#160;h under continuous illumination in ambient air.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Bipolar Photoresponse with Amplified Photocurrents in an Electrolyte&#8208;Assisted Bipolar p&#8211;n Junction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bipolar&#8208;junction photoelectrode based on p&#8211;n junction gallium nitride nanowires with ruthenium oxides surface decoration is built. The device exhibits unambiguously boosted bipolar photoresponse by an enhancement of 775% and 3000% for positive and negative photocurrents, respectively. Finally, a dual&#8208;band optical communication system incorporated with such photoelectrode is constructed using only one photoelectrode to decode dual&#8208;channel signals with encrypted property.








Abstract
The p&#8211;n junction with bipolar characteristics sets the fundamental unit to build electronics while its unique rectification behavior constrains the degree of carrier tunability for expanded functionalities. Herein, a bipolar&#8208;junction photoelectrode employed with a gallium nitride (GaN) p&#8211;n homojunction nanowire array that operates in electrolyte is reported, demonstrating bipolar photoresponse controlled by different wavelengths of light. Significantly, with rational decoration of a ruthenium oxides (RuOx) layer on nanowires guided by theoretical modeling, the resulting RuOx/p&#8211;n GaN photoelectrode exhibits unambiguously boosted bipolar photoresponse by an enhancement of 775% and 3000% for positive and negative photocurrents, respectively, compared to the pristine nanowires. The loading of the RuOx layer on nanowire surface optimizes surface band bending, which facilitates charge transfer across the GaN/electrolyte interface, meanwhile promoting the efficiency of redox reaction for both hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction which corresponds to the negative and positive photocurrents, respectively. Finally, a dual&#8208;channel optical communication system incorporated with such photoelectrode is constructed with using only one photoelectrode to decode dual&#8208;band signals with encrypted property. The proposed bipolar device architecture presents a viable route to manipulate the carrier dynamics for the development of a plethora of multifunctional optoelectronic devices for future sensing, communication, and imaging systems.

   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; layer on nanowire surface optimizes surface band bending, which facilitates charge transfer across the GaN/electrolyte interface, meanwhile promoting the efficiency of redox reaction for both hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction which corresponds to the negative and positive photocurrents, respectively. Finally, a dual-channel optical communication system incorporated with such photoelectrode is constructed with using only one photoelectrode to decode dual-band signals with encrypted property. The proposed bipolar device architecture presents a viable route to manipulate the carrier dynamics for the development of a plethora of multifunctional optoelectronic devices for future sensing, communication, and imaging systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Microfluidic Templated Stem Cell Spheroid Microneedles for&#160;Diabetic Wound Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel stem cell spheroid loaded microneedle patch fabricated with an advanced microfluidic template approach is presented. The microneedle platform enables the precise delivery and exchange of multiple active substances, which contribute to advanced neovascularization, collagen deposition, and tissue reconstruction of diabetic wounds.








Abstract
Wound dressing patches based on stem cells have demonstrated promising potential in the treatment of diabetic wounds, while their capabilities in the maintenance of cell stemness, effective exchange of cellular substance, and precise targeting of the stem cells remain to be promoted. Here, a novel stem cell spheroid loaded microneedle (MN@SPs) patch is presented using microfluidic templating technology. By leveraging the precise fluid manipulation capabilities of the microfluidic template, stem cell spheroids (SPs) with uniform size can be generated in situ. The resulting SPs exhibit advanced viability and cell functions, as evidenced by the overexpressed genes related to extracellular matrix organization and angiogenesis. By loading these SPs into the microneedles (MNs), the platform enables the precise delivery and exchange of multiple active substances, which contribute to advanced neovascularization, collagen deposition, and tissue reconstruction of diabetic wounds. Overall, this microfluidic&#8208;engineered stem cell therapy platform demonstrates significant promise in promoting wound healing.

         <title>Rationalized Electroepitaxy toward Scalable Single&#8208;Crystal Zn Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scalable Zn electroepitaxy is realized on the mass&#8208;produced mono&#8208;oriented Cu(111) foil by reasonably circumventing interface distorted alloying and electroosmosis of the second kind, harvesting ultrahigh reversibility of Zn anodes.








Abstract
Electroepitaxy is recognized as an effective approach to prepare metal electrodes with nearly complete reversibility. Nevertheless, large&#8208;scale manipulation is still not attainable owing to complicated interfacial chemistry. Here, the feasibility of extending Zn electroepitaxy toward the bulk phase over a mass&#8208;produced mono&#8208;oriented Cu(111) foil is demonstrated. Interfacial Cu&#8211;Zn alloy and turbulent electroosmosis are circumvented by adopting a potentiostatic electrodeposition protocol. The as&#8208;prepared Zn single&#8208;crystalline anode enables stable cycling of symmetric cells at a stringent current density of 50.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The assembled full cell further sustaines a capacity retention of 95.7% at 5.0 A g&#8722;1 for 1500 cycles, accompanied by a controllably low N/P ratio of 7.5. In addition to Zn, Ni electroepitaxy can be realized by using the same approach. This study may inspire rational exploration of the design of high&#8208;end metal electrodes.

         <title>In Situ Device&#8208;Level TEM Characterization Based on Ultra&#8208;Flexible Multilayer MoS2 Micro&#8208;Cantilever</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#160;situ opto&#8208;electromechanical transmission electron microscopy characterization platform is first developed by integrating with an ultra&#8208;flexible piezoresistive molybdenum disulfide&#160;micro&#8208;cantilever for device&#8208;level electromechanical and opto&#8208;electromechanical mechanism exploration.








Abstract
Current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in&#160;situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization technology has been capable of statically or dynamically nanorobotic manipulating specimens, affording abundant atom&#8208;level material attributes. However, an insurmountable barrier between material attributes investigations and device&#8208;level application explorations exists due to immature in&#160;situ TEM manufacturing technology and sufficient external coupled stimulus. These limitations seriously prevent the development of in&#160;situ device&#8208;level TEM characterization. Herein, a representative in&#160;situ opto&#8208;electromechanical TEM characterization platform is put forward by integrating an ultra&#8208;flexible micro&#8208;cantilever chip with optical, mechanical, and electrical coupling fields for the first time. On this platform, static and dynamic in&#160;situ device&#8208;level TEM characterizations are implemented by utilizing molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)&#160;nanoflake as channel material. E&#8208;beam modulation behavior in MoS2&#160;transistors is demonstrated at ultra&#8208;high e&#8208;beam acceleration voltage (300&#160;kV), stemming from inelastic scattering electron doping into MoS2&#160;nanoflakes. Moreover, in&#160;situ dynamic bending MoS2&#160;nanodevices without/with laser irradiation reveals asymmetric piezoresistive properties based on electromechanical effects and secondary enhanced photocurrent based on opto&#8208;electromechanical coupling effects, accompanied by real&#8208;time monitoring atom&#8208;level characterization. This approach provides a step toward advanced in&#160;situ device&#8208;level TEM characterization technology with excellent perception ability and inspires in&#160;situ TEM characterization with ultra&#8208;sensitive force feedback and light sensing.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Driven Solvation toward Low&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries with Temperature&#8208;Adaptive Feature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Salt precipitation is resolved via tuning the entropy of solvation in a strong&#8208;solvation (SS)&#8211;weak&#8208;solvation (WS) solvent mixture. As a result, the solvation structure can transform at low temperature by spontaneous increase in entropy of the electrolyte, with a feature of temperature&#8208;adaption. This ensures a fast de&#8208;ionization process and stable co&#8208;intercalation process at low temperature.









Abstract
Salt precipitation at temperatures far above the freezing point of solvents is primarily responsible for performance decay of rechargeable batteries at low temperature, yet is still challenged by a lack of in&#8208;depth understanding of the design principle and ultimate solutions. Here, this is resolved via tuning the entropy of solvation in a strong&#8208;solvation (SS) and weak&#8208;solvation (WS) solvent mixture, in which a solvation structure can spontaneously transform at low temperature to avoid salt precipitation, endowing the electrolyte with a temperature&#8208;adaptive feature. The results affirm that such temperature&#8208;adaptive electrolyte ensures encouraging low&#8208;temperature performance in a hard carbon||Na2/3Ni1/4Cu1/12Mn2/3O2 full cell with 90.6% capacity retention over 400 cycles at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. The generality of the concept is further expanded to construct a series of SS&#8211;WS electrolytes as potential candidates for rechargeable low&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The work shed lights on the importance of entropy tuning and affords a rational viewpoint on designing low&#8208;temperature electrolytes.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ordering transformation of high&#8208;entropy Pt4FeCoNiCu nanoparticles from disordered solid&#8208;solution alloy to ordered intermetallic structure is demonstrated across multiple scales. The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities are revealed to be ordering&#8208;dependent, and the highly ordered Pt4FeCoNiCu outperforms most other Pt&#8208;based catalysts for HER and ORR with robust durability.








Abstract
Disordered solid&#8208;solution high&#8208;entropy alloys have attracted wide research attention as robust electrocatalysts. In comparison, ordered high&#8208;entropy intermetallics have been hardly explored and the effects of the degree of chemical ordering on catalytic activity remain unknown. In this study, a series of multicomponent intermetallic Pt4FeCoCuNi nanoparticles with tunable ordering degrees is fabricated. The transformation mechanism of the multicomponent nanoparticles from disordered structure into ordered structure is revealed at the single&#8208;particle level, and it agrees with macroscopic analysis by selected&#8208;area electron diffraction and X&#8208;ray diffraction. The electrocatalytic performance of Pt4FeCoCuNi nanoparticles correlates well with their crystal structure and electronic structure. It is found that increasing the degree of ordering promotes electrocatalytic performance. The highly ordered Pt4FeCoCuNi achieves the highest mass activities toward both acidic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) which are 18.9&#8208;fold and 5.6&#8208;fold higher than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively. The experiment also shows that this catalyst demonstrates better long&#8208;term stability than both partially ordered and disordered Pt4FeCoCuNi as well as Pt/C when subject to both HER and ORR. This ordering&#8208;dependent structure&#8211;property relationship provides insight into the rational design of catalysts and stimulates the exploration of many other multicomponent intermetallic alloys.

         <title>Heteroatom&#8208;Driven Coordination Fields Altering Single Cerium Atom Sites for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through ubtle modulation of the coordination environments by introducing P and S heteroatoms, the Ce electroactive sites are modulated to achieve effective enhancement of the oxygen reduction reaction's intrinsic catalytic activity. This work supplies significant references for optimizing the electroactivity of atomic catalysts by a coordination regulation strategy.








Abstract
For current single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), modulating the coordination environments of rare&#8208;earth (RE) single atoms with complex electronic orbital and flexible chemical states is still limited. Herein, cerium (Ce) SAs supported on a P, S, and N co&#8208;doped hollow carbon substrate (Ce SAs/PSNC) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are reported. The as&#8208;prepared Ce SAs/PSNC possesses a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.90&#160;V, a turnover frequency value of 52.2&#160;s&#8722;1 at 0.85&#160;V, and excellent stability for the ORR, which exceeds the commercial Pt/C and most recent SACs. Ce SAs/PSNC&#8208;based liquid zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) exhibit a high and stable open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.49&#160;V and a maximum power density of 212&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2. As the catalyst of the air cathode, it also displays remarkable performance in flexible electronic devices. Theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of S and P sites induces significant electronic modulations to the Ce SA active sites. The P and S dopings promote the electroactivity of Ce SAs and improve the overall site&#8208;to&#8208;site electron transfer within the Ce SAs/PSNC. This work offers a unique perspective for modulating RE&#8208;based SACs in a complex coordination environment toward superior electrocatalysis and broad applications in energy conversion and storage devices.

Crystal Misorientation
In article number 2300373, Andrew J. Lew, Davide Ruffoni, Markus J. Buehler, Pupa U. P. A. Gilbert, and co&#8208;workers reveal that the toughness of polycrystalline seashells and coral skeletons is increased by small misorientation of adjacent crystals. The findings pave the way toward bioinspired materials with tunable toughness.

Drug Delivery
In article number 2212210, Funan Liu, Hongjun Li, Zhen Gu, and co&#8208;workers present an oncolytic virus therapy that can target metastasis after systemic administration. Tumor cells that have been pre&#8208;infected with an oncolytic virus serve as the delivery vehicle after pathogenicity has been eliminated by liquid nitrogen shock, but their metastasis&#8208;targeting ability is maintained by the integrity of cellular structure and surface protein preservation. This Trojan&#8208;horse&#8208;like method prevents virus neutralization and clearance in the bloodstream and improves tumor&#8208;specific delivery.

Photoelectrodes
A bipolar&#8208;junction photoelectrode based on a p&#8211;n&#8208;junction GaN nanowire array is shown by Haiding Sun and co&#8208;workers in article number 2300911 to exhibit unambiguously bipolar photoresponse with an output of positive and negative photocurrents under illumination of 365 nm and 265 nm light, respectively. Importantly, a dual&#8208;band optical communication system incorporated with such a photoelectrode is constructed using only one photoelectrode to decode dual&#8208;channel signals with encrypted property.

TEM Cantilever Chips
In article number 2301439, Chaojian Hou, Jing Zhao, Lixin Dong, and co&#8208;workers report a cantilever chip for in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The chip consists of a MoS2 opto&#8208;electromechanical sensor and a plasmonic antenna array built on the top of a Si3N4 cantilever, forming an electron&#8208;beam&#8208;transparent (thickness &#8776;100 nm) nano&#8208;opto&#8208;electromechanical system (NOEMS), enabling the in situ calibration/characterization of the NOEMS sensor or another device, with the NOEMS serving as a sensor to correlate the physical properties and atomic structures.

Abstract
The emergence of plastic electronics satisfies the increasing demand for flexible electronics. However, it has caused severe ecological problems. Flexible electronics based on natural materials are increasing to hopefully realize the &#8220;green&#8221; and eco&#8208;friendly concept. Herein, recent advances in the design and fabrication of green flexible electronics are reviewed. First, this review comprehensively introduces various natural materials and derivatives, focusing particularly on fibroin and silk, wood and paper, plants, and biomass. Second, fabrication techniques for modifying natural materials, including physical and chemical methods, are presented, after which their merits and demerits are thoroughly discussed. Green flexible electronics based on natural materials, comprising electrical wires/electrodes, antennas, thermal management devices, transistors, memristors, sensors, energy&#8208;harvesting devices, energy&#8208;storage devices, displays, actuators, electromagnetic shielding, and integration systems, are described in detail. Finally, perspectives on the existing challenges and opportunities to employ natural materials in green flexible electronics are presented.

         <title>Defective Metal Oxides: Lessons from CO2RR and Applications in NOxRR</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boosting the intrinsic activity of active sites on oxide surfaces is a critical factor in promoting electrochemical conversion reactions. A special focus is placed on the structure&#8211;performance relationship of oxygen vacancies in carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR)/nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) electrocatalysts. This work examines the formation/characterization of defects for CO2RR, taking learnings, challenges, and future directions in designing defective oxides for the emerging field of NO3RR.








Abstract
Sluggish reaction kinetics and the undesired side reactions (hydrogen evolution reaction and self&#8208;reduction) are the main bottlenecks of electrochemical conversion reactions, such as the carbon dioxide and nitrate reduction reactions (CO2RR and NO3RR). To date, conventional strategies to overcome these challenges involve electronic structure modification and modulation&#160;of the&#160;charge&#8208;transfer behavior. Nonetheless, key aspects of surface modification, focused on boosting the intrinsic activity of active sites on the catalyst surface, are yet to be fully understood. Engingeering of oxygen vacancies (OVs) can tune surface/bulk electronic structure and improve surface active sites of electrocatalysts. The continuous breakthroughs and significant progress in the last decade position engineering of OVs as a potential technique for advancing electrocatalysis. Motivated by this, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art findings of the roles of OVs in both the CO2RR and the NO3RR are presented. The review starts with a description of approaches to constructing and techniques for characterizing OVs. This is followed by an overview of the mechanistic understanding of the CO2RR and a detailed discussion on the roles of OVs in the CO2RR. Then, insights into the NO3RR mechanism and the potential of OVs on NO3RR based on early findings are&#160;highlighted.

&lt;p&gt;Boosting the intrinsic activity of active sites on oxide surfaces is a critical factor in promoting electrochemical conversion reactions. A special focus is placed on the structure&#8211;performance relationship of oxygen vacancies in carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR)/nitrate reduction reaction (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR) electrocatalysts. This work examines the formation/characterization of defects for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR, taking learnings, challenges, and future directions in designing defective oxides for the emerging field of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sluggish reaction kinetics and the undesired side reactions (hydrogen evolution reaction and self-reduction) are the main bottlenecks of electrochemical conversion reactions, such as the carbon dioxide and nitrate reduction reactions (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR and NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR). To date, conventional strategies to overcome these challenges involve electronic structure modification and modulation&#160;of the&#160;charge-transfer behavior. Nonetheless, key aspects of surface modification, focused on boosting the intrinsic activity of active sites on the catalyst surface, are yet to be fully understood. Engingeering of oxygen vacancies (OVs) can tune surface/bulk electronic structure and improve surface active sites of electrocatalysts. The continuous breakthroughs and significant progress in the last decade position engineering of OVs as a potential technique for advancing electrocatalysis. Motivated by this, the state-of-the-art findings of the roles of OVs in both the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR and the NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR are presented. The review starts with a description of approaches to constructing and techniques for characterizing OVs. This is followed by an overview of the mechanistic understanding of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR and a detailed discussion on the roles of OVs in the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR. Then, insights into the NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR mechanism and the potential of OVs on NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR based on early findings are&#160;highlighted. Finally, the challenges in designing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR/NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR electrocatalysts and perspectives in studying OV engineering are provided.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Materials Innovations for Quantum Technology Acceleration: A Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview of quantum applications relating to types of qubits that rely on development and control of quantum material systems and their respective device architectures is presented. The success of quantum technology rapid growth lies in the bottom&#8208;up pull of qubit characteristics in the manifestation of quantum behavior discovery.








Abstract
A broad perspective of quantum technology state of the art is provided and critical stumbling blocks for quantum technology development are identified. Innovations in demonstrating and understanding electron entanglement phenomena using bulk and low&#8208;dimensional materials and structures are summarized. Correlated photon&#8208;pair generation via processes such as nonlinear optics is discussed. Application of qubits to current and future high&#8208;impact quantum technology development is presented. Approaches for realizing unique qubit features for large&#8208;scale encrypted communication, sensing, computing, and other technologies are still evolving; thus, materials innovation is crucially important. A perspective on materials modeling approaches for quantum technology acceleration that incorporate physics&#8208;based AI/ML, integrated with quantum metrology is discussed.

Inspired by a world entering a quantum age, a human&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;loop framework is presented, which addresses key challenges and opportunities to overcome in the manufacturing of quantum materials.








Abstract
The quantum age is just around the corner. As quantum systems become more stable, robust, and mainstream, tackling the challenge of high&#8208;throughput manufacturing will require further developments in materials synthesis, characterization, assembly, and diagnostics. As the building blocks of future technologies scale down to atomic and molecular scales, a paradigm shift in manufacturing will begin to take shape. Inspired by a quantum manufacturing world that elevates the Materials Genome Initiative to the next level, a &#8220;human&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;loop&#8221; framework for high&#8208;throughput manufacturing, which addresses key opportunities and challenges to be overcome, is outlined.

         <dc:description>
Topological materials offer conceptual novelties and provide unique platforms for exploring fundamental science questions and transformational next&#8208;generation technologies. This perspective presents a cross section&#160;through the recent work focused on understanding the role of geometry and topology in generating topological states and their responses to external stimuli, and as a basis for connecting theory and experiment within the band theory paradigm. The image highlights how constant energy surfaces in topological materials differ fundamentally from those in normal materials.








Abstract
Interest in topological materials continues to grow unabated in view of their conceptual novelties as well as their potential as platforms for transformational new technologies. Electronic states in a topological material are robust against perturbations and support unconventional electromagnetic responses. The first&#8208;principles band&#8208;theory paradigm has been a key player in the field by providing successful prediction of many new classes of topological materials. This perspective presents a cross section&#160;through the recent work on understanding the role of geometry and topology in generating topological states and their responses to external stimuli, and as a basis for connecting theory and experiment within the band theory framework. In this work, effective strategies for topological materials discovery and impactful directions for future topological materials research are also commented.

Quantum Applications
In article number 2201064, Ajit K. Roy and co&#8208;workers present a perspective of quantum technology state of the art wherein critical stumbling blocks for quantum technology development are identified. As represented in the cover, atomic defects are created in a transition metal chalcogenide (TMD) thin film with a specialized tip in an atomic force microscope. AFM tip tracing indicates atomic&#8208;scale localization of materials states at the defect location. These controlled and localized defect sites are the source of quantum signal generation under a biased field.

         <title>Through the Lens of a Momentum Microscope: Viewing Light&#8208;Induced Quantum Phenomena in 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, time&#8208;resolved momentum&#8208;microscopy is highlighted as a powerful new technique for characterizing photoexcited two&#8208;dimensional materials in momentum&#8208;space. The recent scientific progress that is&#160;made thanks to this technique is surveyed. The future directions in which it will be impactful are outlined: the dynamics of photoexcitations, and the control of the band&#8208;structure by Floquet band engineering.








Abstract
Van der Waals (vdW) materials at their 2D limit are diverse, flexible, and unique laboratories to study fundamental quantum phenomena and their future applications. Their novel properties rely on their pronounced Coulomb interactions, variety of crystal symmetries and spin&#8208;physics, and the ease of incorporation of different vdW materials to form sophisticated heterostructures. In particular, the excited state properties of many 2D semiconductors and semi&#8208;metals are relevant for their technological applications, particularly those that can be induced by light. In this paper, the recent advances made in studying out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium, light&#8208;induced, phenomena in these materials are reviewed using powerful, surface&#8208;sensitive, time&#8208;resolved photoemission&#8208;based techniques, with a particular emphasis on the emerging multi&#8208;dimensional photoemission spectroscopy technique of time&#8208;resolved momentum microscopy. The advances this technique has enabled in studying the nature and dynamics of occupied excited states in these materials are discussed. Then, the future research directions opened by these scientific and instrumental advancements are projected for studying the physics of 2D materials and the opportunities to engineer their band&#8208;structure and band&#8208;topology by laser fields.

         <title>Magnetic Topological Insulator Heterostructures: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of topology and magnetic order can lead to new quantum states and exotic physical effects. An overview of proximity&#8208;coupled magnetic topological insulator heterostructures, involving modulation doping, magnetic insulators, antiferromagnets, and rare&#8208;earth dopants, is given. They form a platform for exploring emergent phenomena such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect, real&#8208;space topological spin textures, and interfacial exchange coupling.








Abstract
Topological insulators (TIs) provide intriguing prospects for the future of spintronics due to their large spin&#8211;orbit coupling and dissipationless, counter&#8208;propagating conduction channels in the surface state. The combination of topological properties and magnetic order can lead to new quantum states including the quantum anomalous Hall effect that was&#160;first experimentally realized in Cr&#8208;doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 films. Since magnetic doping can introduce detrimental effects, requiring very low operational temperatures, alternative approaches are explored. Proximity coupling to magnetically ordered systems is an obvious option, with the prospect to raise the temperature for observing the various quantum effects. Here, an overview of proximity coupling and interfacial effects in TI heterostructures is presented, which provides a versatile materials platform for tuning the magnetic and topological properties of these exciting materials. An introduction is first given to the heterostructure growth by molecular beam epitaxy and suitable structural, electronic, and magnetic characterization techniques. Going beyond transition&#8208;metal&#8208;doped and undoped TI heterostructures, examples of heterostructures are discussed, including rare&#8208;earth&#8208;doped TIs, magnetic insulators, and antiferromagnets, which lead to exotic phenomena such as skyrmions and exchange bias. Finally, an outlook on novel heterostructures such as intrinsic magnetic TIs and systems including 2D materials is&#160;given.

         <dc:description>
Thermoelectric conversion has been extensively studied in low&#8208;dimensional materials where quantum confinement and spin textures can largely modulate thermopower generation. In this review, the thermoelectric microscopy&#8208;based quantum sensing of thermopower from classical, spin&#8208;polarized electron transport, collective spin dynamics, and relativistic effect is summarized. Investigating the microscopic nature of thermopower in quantum materials provide insights for the future thermoelectric applications.








Abstract
Thermoelectric power, has been extensively studied in low&#8208;dimensional materials where quantum confinement and spin textures can largely modulate thermopower generation. In addition to classical and macroscopic values, thermopower also varies locally over a wide range of length scales, and is fundamentally linked to electron wave functions and phonon propagation. Various experimental methods for the quantum sensing of localized thermopower have been suggested, particularly based on scanning probe microscopy. Here, critical advances in the quantum sensing of thermopower are introduced, from the atomic to the several&#8208;hundred&#8208;nanometer scales, including the unique role of low&#8208;dimensionality, defects, spins, and relativistic effects for optimized power generation. Investigating the microscopic nature of thermopower in quantum materials can provide insights useful for the design of advanced materials for future thermoelectric applications. Quantum sensing techniques for thermopower can pave the way to practical and novel energy devices for a sustainable society.

         <title>Understanding Heterogeneities in Quantum Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterogeneities such as defects, impurities, edges, interfaces, and disorder often define and affect the coherence, interaction, entanglement, and topology of quantum states. Their roles in quantum materials are examined at the atomistic level by revealing the different degrees of freedom of heterogeneities, understanding their effects on the host material, and controlling heterogeneities to create new materials with tailored quantum functions.








Abstract
Quantum materials are usually heterogeneous, with structural defects, impurities, surfaces, edges, interfaces, and disorder. These heterogeneities are sometimes viewed as liabilities within conventional systems; however, their electronic and magnetic structures often define and affect the quantum phenomena such as coherence, interaction, entanglement, and topological effects in the host system. Therefore, a critical need is to understand the roles of heterogeneities in order to endow materials with new quantum functions for energy and quantum information science applications. In this article, several representative examples are reviewed on the recent progress in connecting the heterogeneities to the quantum behaviors of real materials. Specifically, three intertwined topic areas are assessed: i) Reveal the structural, electronic, magnetic, vibrational, and optical degrees of freedom of heterogeneities. ii) Understand the effect of heterogeneities on the behaviors of quantum states in host material systems. iii) Control heterogeneities for new quantum functions. This progress is achieved by establishing the atomistic&#8208;level structure&#8208;property relationships associated with heterogeneities in quantum materials. The understanding of the interactions between electronic, magnetic, photonic, and vibrational states of heterogeneities enables the design of new quantum materials, including topological matter and quantum light emitters based on heterogenous 2D materials.

         <title>Strain Engineering of Low&#8208;Dimensional Materials for Emerging Quantum Phenomena and Functionalities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in strain&#8208;tunable quantum phenomena and functionalities, focusing on low&#8208;dimensional quantum materials. Experimental strategies for strain engineering are discussed in terms of heterogeneity and elastic reconfigurability of strain distribution. The nontrivial quantum properties of several strain&#8208;quantum coupled platforms, including 2D van der Waals materials and heterostructures, topological insulators, superconducting oxides, and metal halide perovskites, are outlined.








Abstract
Recent discoveries of exotic physical phenomena, such as unconventional superconductivity in magic&#8208;angle twisted bilayer graphene, dissipationless Dirac fermions in topological insulators, and quantum spin liquids, have triggered tremendous interest in quantum materials. The macroscopic revelation of quantum mechanical effects in quantum materials is associated with strong electron&#8211;electron correlations in the lattice, particularly where materials have reduced dimensionality. Owing to the strong correlations and confined geometry, altering atomic spacing and crystal symmetry via strain has emerged as an effective and versatile pathway for perturbing the subtle equilibrium of quantum states. This review highlights recent advances in strain&#8208;tunable quantum phenomena and functionalities, with particular focus on low&#8208;dimensional quantum materials. Experimental strategies for strain engineering are first discussed in terms of heterogeneity and elastic reconfigurability of strain distribution. The nontrivial quantum properties of several strain&#8208;quantum coupled platforms, including 2D van der Waals materials and heterostructures, topological insulators, superconducting oxides, and metal halide perovskites, are next outlined, with current challenges and future opportunities in quantum straintronics followed. Overall, strain engineering of quantum phenomena and functionalities is a rich field for fundamental research of many&#8208;body interactions and holds substantial promise for next&#8208;generation electronics capable of ultrafast, dissipationless, and secure information processing and communications.

         <title>Harnessing the Quantum Behavior of Spins on Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By incorporating electron spin resonance capability in spin&#8208;polarized scanning tunneling microscopy, quantum states of individual spins on surfaces can be initialized, controlled, and read out. Individual spins and artificial spin structures built atom&#8208;by&#8208;atom provide new platforms for sensing magnetic interactions, performing quantum operations, and simulating spin Hamiltonians at the atomic scale.








Abstract
The desire to control and measure individual quantum systems such as atoms and ions in a vacuum has led to significant scientific and engineering developments in the past decades that form the basis of today's quantum information science. Single atoms and molecules on surfaces, on the other hand, are heavily investigated by physicists, chemists, and material scientists in search of novel electronic and magnetic functionalities. These two paths crossed in 2015 when it was&#160;first clearly demonstrated that individual spins on a surface can be coherently controlled and read out in an all&#8208;electrical fashion. The enabling technique is a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and electron spin resonance, which offers unprecedented coherent controllability at the Angstrom length scale. This review aims to illustrate the essential ingredients that allow the quantum operations of single spins on surfaces. Three domains of applications of surface spins, namely quantum sensing, quantum control, and quantum simulation, are discussed with physical principles explained and examples presented. Enabled by the atomically&#8208;precise fabrication capability of STM, single spins on surfaces might one day lead to the realization of quantum nanodevices and artificial quantum materials at the atomic&#160;scale.

The basic concepts of quantum computing, communications, and sensing technologies are introduced. The current materials&#8208;related challenges in current quantum devices are identified and how nanoscale and low&#8208;dimensional materials may be used to overcome these challenges is considered. Theoretical and experimental studies on nanomaterials for quantum devices are reviewed.








Abstract
Quantum information science and engineering (QISE)&#8212;which entails the use of quantum mechanical states for information processing, communications, and sensing&#8212;and the area of nanoscience and nanotechnology have dominated condensed matter physics and materials science research in the 21st century. Solid&#8208;state devices for QISE have, to this point, predominantly been designed with bulk materials as their constituents. This review considers how nanomaterials (i.e., materials with intrinsic quantum confinement) may offer inherent advantages over conventional materials for QISE. The materials challenges for specific types of qubits, along with how emerging nanomaterials may overcome these challenges, are identified. Challenges for and progress toward nanomaterials&#8208;based quantum devices are condidered. The overall aim of the review is to help close the gap between the nanotechnology and quantum information communities and inspire research that will lead to next&#8208;generation quantum devices for scalable and practical quantum applications.

         <title>Benchmarking Noise and Dephasing in Emerging Electrical Materials for Quantum Technologies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The available data on low&#8208;frequency fluctuations in electrical properties are reviewed to benchmark dephasing and noise in materials that are of direct interest to quantum technologies. The physical processes causing dephasing and noise are elaborated, the impact of both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters is evaluated, and it is hoped that a clearer pathway to design, characterize and implement both material and devices for quantum&#160;applications is thus provided.








Abstract
As quantum technologies develop, a specific class of electrically conducting materials is rapidly gaining interest because they not only form the core quantum&#8208;enabled elements in superconducting qubits, semiconductor nanostructures, or sensing devices, but also the peripheral circuitry. The phase coherence of the electronic wave function in these emerging materials will be crucial when incorporated in the quantum architecture. The loss of phase memory, or dephasing, occurs when a quantum system interacts with the fluctuations in the local electromagnetic environment, which manifests in &#8220;noise&#8221; in the electrical conductivity. Hence, characterizing these materials and devices therefrom, for quantum applications, requires evaluation of both dephasing and noise, although there are very few materials where these properties are investigated simultaneously. Here, the available data on magnetotransport and low&#8208;frequency fluctuations in electrical conductivity are reviewed to benchmark the dephasing and noise. The focus is on new materials that are of direct interest to quantum technologies. The physical processes causing dephasing and noise in these systems are elaborated, the impact of both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters from materials synthesis and devices realization are evaluated, and it is hoped that a clearer pathway to design and characterize both material and devices for quantum&#160;applications is thus provided.

The physical processes causing dephasing and noise in these systems are elaborated, the impact of both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters from materials synthesis and devices realization are evaluated, and it is hoped that a clearer pathway to design and characterize both material and devices for quantum&#160;applications is thus provided.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quantum&#8208;Engineered Devices Based on 2D Materials for Next&#8208;Generation Information Processing and Storage</title>

2D layered materials, exhibiting exotic structural, electrical, and magnetic properties, provide a superior platform for implementing novel quantum devices&#8212;from tunneling diodes and transistors, to spin&#8208;FETs, valley&#8208;FETs, and qubits. The physics are highlighted and the opportunities and challenges of exploiting the unique quantum properties of 2D materials to enable revolutionary ultra&#8208;energy&#8208;efficient quantum devices are analyzed.








Abstract
As an approximation to the quantum state of solids, the band theory, developed nearly seven decades ago, fostered the advance of modern integrated solid&#8208;state electronics, one of the most successful technologies in the history of human civilization. Nonetheless, their rapidly growing energy consumption and accompanied environmental issues call for more energy&#8208;efficient electronics and optoelectronics, which necessitate the exploration of more advanced quantum mechanical effects, such as band&#8208;to&#8208;band tunneling, spin&#8211;orbit coupling, spin&#8211;valley locking, and quantum entanglement. The emerging 2D layered materials, featured by their exotic electrical, magnetic, optical, and structural properties, provide a revolutionary low&#8208;dimensional and manufacture&#8208;friendly platform (and many more opportunities) to implement these quantum&#8208;engineered devices, compared to the traditional electronic materials system. Here, the progress in quantum&#8208;engineered devices is reviewed and the opportunities/challenges of exploiting 2D materials are analyzed to highlight their unique quantum properties that enable novel energy&#8208;efficient devices, and useful insights to quantum device engineers and 2D&#8208;material scientists are provided.

         <title>Recent Development of Ultrafast Optical Characterizations for Quantum Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advent of ultrashort optical pulses has provided unprecedented opportunities to probe and manipulate physical properties of quantum materials. There have been rapid growing discoveries of photoinduced new phenomena and nonlinear properties. A review on recent progress of ultrafast optical characterization and manipulation of quantum states, specifically in systems with broken&#8208;symmetry states or phase transitions, and prospects are provided.








Abstract
The advent of intense ultrashort optical pulses spanning a frequency range from terahertz to the visible has opened a new era in the experimental investigation and manipulation of quantum materials. The generation of strong optical field in an ultrashort time scale enables the steering of quantum materials nonadiabatically, inducing novel phenomenon or creating new phases which may not have an equilibrium counterpart. Ultrafast time&#8208;resolved optical techniques have provided rich information and played an important role in characterization of the nonequilibrium and nonlinear properties of solid systems. Here, some of the recent progress of ultrafast optical techniques and their applications to the detection and manipulation of physical properties in selected quantum materials are reviewed. Specifically, the new development in the detection of the Higgs mode and photoinduced nonequilibrium response in the study of superconductors by time&#8208;resolved terahertz spectroscopy are discussed.
