         <title>Skin Thermal Management for Subcutaneous Photoelectric Conversion Reaching 500&#160;Mw</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Despite possessing higher tissue transmittance and maximum permissible exposure power density for skins relative to other electromagnetic waves, second near&#8208;infrared light (1000&#8764;1350&#160;nm) is scarcely applicable to subcutaneous photoelectric conversion, owing to the companion of photothermal effect. Here, a skin thermal management is conceived to utmostly utilize the photothermal effect of a photovoltaic cell, which not only improves the photoelectric conversion efficiency but also eliminates the skin hyperthermia. In vivo, the output power can be higher than 500&#160;mW with a photoelectric conversion efficiency as 9.4%. This output power is promising to recharge all the clinically applied implantable devices via wireless power transmission, e.g. clinical pacemakers (6&#8764;200 &#956;W), drug pump (0.5&#8764;2&#160;mW), cochlear (5&#8764;40&#160;mW), and wireless endo&#8208;photo cameras (&#8764;100&#160;mW).

         <title>Tailoring the Atomic&#8208;Local Environment of Carbon Nanotube Tips for Selective H2O2 Electrosynthesis at High Current Densities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The atomic&#8208;local environment of catalytically active sites plays an important role in tuning the activity of carbon&#8208;based metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts (C&#8208;MFECs). However, the rational regulation of the environment is always impeded by synthetic limitations and insufficient understanding of the formation mechanism of the catalytic sites. Herein, the possible cleavage mechanism of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through the crossing points during ball&#8208;milling is proposed, resulting in abundant CNT tips those are more susceptible to be modified by heteroatoms, achieving precise modulation of the atomic environment at the tips. The obtained CNTs with N, S&#8208;rich tips (N,S&#8208;TCNTs) exhibit a wide potential window of 0.59&#160;V along with H2O2 selectivity for over 90.0%. Even using air as the O2 source, the flow cell system with N,S&#8208;TCNTs catalyst attains high H2O2 productivity up to 30.37&#160;mol gcat.&#8722;1 h&#8722;1@350&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, superior to most reported C&#8208;MFECs. From a practical point of view, a solid electrolyzer based on N,S&#8208;TCNTs is further employed to realize the in&#8208;situ continuous generation of pure H2O2 solution with high productivity (up to 4.35&#160;mmol cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1@300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2; over 300&#160;h). The CNTs with functionalized tips hold a great permission for practical applications, even beyond H2O2 generation.

         <title>Engineering Single&#8208;Layer Hollow Structure of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides with High 1T&#8208;Phase Purity for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Rational design and controllable synthesis of hollow structures based on transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have gained tremendous attention in the field of clean energy. However, the general synthetic strategies to fabricate single&#8208;layer hollow structures of TMDs, especially with unconventional phases (e.g., 1T or 1T&#8242;), still pose significant challenges. Herein, we report a scalable method for the synthesis of single&#8208;layer hollow spheres (SLHS) of TMDs with high 1T&#8208;phase purity by etching bismuth (Bi) cores from pre&#8208;synthesized Bi@TMDs core&#8208;shell heterostructures, including SLHS&#8208;1T&#8208;MoS2, SLHS&#8208;1T&#8208;MoSe2, SLHS&#8208;1T&#8208;WS2, and SLHS&#8208;1T&#8208;WSe2. Additionally, the etched Bi ions can be adsorbed on the single&#8208;layer TMDs shells in the form of single atoms (SAs) via the Bi&#8208;S bond. Due to the benefits of the single&#8208;layer hollow structure, high conductivity of 1T phase, and synergistic effect of Bi SAs and TMDs supports, the fabricated SLHS&#8208;1T&#8208;MoS2 exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen production. This work provides a way to manufacture advanced functional materials based on the single&#8208;layer hollow structures of 1T&#8208;TMDs, and to expand their applications.

         <title>Biodegradable NIR&#8208;II Pseudo Conjugate Polymeric Nanoparticles Amplify Photodynamic Immunotherapy via Alleviation of Tumor Hypoxia and Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophage Reprogramming</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NIR&#8208;II biodegradable pseudo&#8208;conjugate polymer (PSP)&#8208;based photodynamic polymer is designed to deliver a vascular normalization agent, i.e., regorafenib (Reg) in nanoparticles (NP&#8208;PDT@Reg). Under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, NP&#8208;PDT@Reg can on the one hand efficiently release Reg to improve the tumor hypoxia via vascular normalization, making more NP&#8208;PDT@Reg and oxygen enter the tumors. On the other hand, NP&#8208;PDT@Reg + L can further result in more ROS generation to eradicate tumor cells while inducing ICD to activate anti&#8208;tumor immune responses. Furthermore, Reg can reprogram TAMs from a pro&#8208;tumor M2 phenotype to a tumor&#8208;killing M1 phenotype as well, thereby reversing the immunosuppressive TME.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has achieved great success in cancer treatment. Despite its great promise, the efficacy of photodynamic immunotherapy can be limited by the hypoxia in solid tumors which is closely related to the abnormal tumor vasculature. These abnormal vasculatures are a hallmark of most solid tumors and facilitate immune evasion. Therefore, tumor vascular normalization is developed as a promising strategy to overcome tumor hypoxia, resulting in improved cancer therapy. Here, a NIR&#8208;II bio&#8208;degradable pseudo&#8208;conjugate polymer (PSP)&#8208;based photodynamic polymer is designed to deliver a vascular normalization agent, i.e., regorafenib (Reg) in nanoparticles (NP&#8208;PDT@Reg). NP&#8208;PDT@Reg under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation (NP&#8208;PDT@Reg + L) can efficiently release Reg to improve the tumor hypoxia via vascular normalization, making more NP&#8208;PDT@Reg and oxygen enter the tumors. Moreover, NP&#8208;PDT@Reg + L can further result in generation of more reactive oxygen species (ROS) to eradicate tumor cells while inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD) to activate anti&#8208;tumor immune responses. In addition, Reg can reprogram TAM from a pro&#8208;tumor M2 phenotype to a tumor&#8208;killing M1 phenotype as well, thereby reversing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Taken together, the current study provides an innovative perspective on the development of novel nanomaterials to overcome the limitations in photodynamic immunotherapy.

&lt;p&gt;A NIR-II biodegradable pseudo-conjugate polymer (PSP)-based photodynamic polymer is designed to deliver a vascular normalization agent, i.e., regorafenib (Reg) in nanoparticles (NP-PDT@Reg). Under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, NP-PDT@Reg can on the one hand efficiently release Reg to improve the tumor hypoxia via vascular normalization, making more NP-PDT@Reg and oxygen enter the tumors. On the other hand, NP-PDT@Reg + L can further result in more ROS generation to eradicate tumor cells while inducing ICD to activate anti-tumor immune responses. Furthermore, Reg can reprogram TAMs from a pro-tumor M2 phenotype to a tumor-killing M1 phenotype as well, thereby reversing the immunosuppressive TME.

         <title>Composite Spin Hall Conductivity from Non&#8208;Collinear Antiferromagnetic Order</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low symmetry non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnets allow longitudinal and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin currents with x&#770;,z&#770;$\hat{x},\hat{z}$ polarization that are anisotropic in orientation to the magnetic lattice. Here, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin Hall conductivities with &#963;xzx,$\sigma _{{\rm{xz}}}^{\rm{x}},$ &#963;xzy,&#963;xzz$\sigma _{{\rm{xz}}}^{\rm{y}},\ \sigma _{{\rm{xz}}}^{\rm{z}}$ components are found in L12&#8208;ordered antiferromagnetic PtMn3 thin films with large spin torque efficiencies and orientation&#8208;dependent anisotropy, a pathway to efficient spintronic devices with selectable spin polarization.








Abstract
Non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnets (AFMs) are an exciting new platform for studying intrinsic spin Hall effects (SHEs), phenomena that arise from the materials&#8217; band structure, Berry phase curvature, and linear response to an external electric field. In contrast to conventional SHE materials, symmetry analysis of non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnets does not forbid non&#8208;zero longitudinal and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin currents with x&#770;,z&#770;$\hat{x},\hat{z}$ polarization and predicts an anisotropy with current orientation to the magnetic lattice. Here, multi&#8208;component out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin Hall conductivities &#963;xzx,$\sigma _{{\rm{xz}}}^{\rm{x}},$ &#963;xzy,&#963;xzz$\sigma _{{\rm{xz}}}^{\rm{y}},\ \sigma _{{\rm{xz}}}^{\rm{z}}$ are reported in L12&#8208;ordered antiferromagnetic PtMn3 thin films that are uniquely generated in the non&#8208;collinear state. The maximum spin torque efficiencies (&#958;&#8197; = JS&#8197;/Je&#8197;&#8776; 0.3) are significantly larger than in Pt (&#958;&#8197; &#8776; &#8197;0.1). Additionally, the spin Hall conductivities in the non&#8208;collinear state exhibit the predicted orientation&#8208;dependent anisotropy, opening the possibility for new devices with selectable spin polarization. This work demonstrates symmetry control through the magnetic lattice as a pathway to tailored functionality in magnetoelectronic systems.

         <title>Ion&#8211;Dipole Interaction Enabling Highly Efficient CsPbI3 Perovskite Indoor Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The amino naphthalene sulfonates (ANS) molecules are incorporated as a dipolar interlayer at the buried interface to fabricate CsPbI3 perovskite indoor photovoltaics (PIPVs). The strong ion&#8211;dipole interaction between polar ANS molecules and ionic perovskites enables the target PIPVs to deliver a record indoor PCE of up to 41.2% (Pout:137.66&#8201;&#181;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2) under a standard LED light source (2956&#8201;K, 1062&#8201;lux).








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites are ideal candidates for indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) because of their easy&#8208;to&#8208;adjust bandgaps, which can be designed to cover the spectrum of any artificial light source. However, the serious non&#8208;radiative carrier recombination under low light illumination restrains the application of perovskite&#8208;based IPVs (PIPVs). Herein, polar molecules of amino naphthalene sulfonates are employed to functionalize the TiO2 substrate, anchoring the CsPbI3 perovskite crystal grains with a strong ion&#8211;dipole interaction between the molecule&#8208;level polar interlayer and the ionic perovskite film. The resulting high&#8208;quality CsPbI3 films with the merit of defect&#8208;immunity and large shunt resistance under low light conditions enable the corresponding PIPVs with an indoor power conversion efficiency of up to 41.2% (Pin: 334.11&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2, Pout: 137.66&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2) under illumination from a commonly used indoor light&#8208;emitting diode light source (2956 K, 1062 lux). Furthermore, the device also achieves efficiencies of 29.45% (Pout: 9.80&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2) and 32.54% (Pout: 54.34&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2) at 106 (Pin: 33.84&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2) and 522 lux (Pin: 168.21&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2), respectively.

         <title>Engineering of Defective MOF&#8208;801 Nanostructures within Macroporous Spheres for Highly Efficient and Stable Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystallization of MOF&#8208;801 on the surface of macroporous poly (N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide&#8208;glycidyl methacrylate) spheres via a facile in situ confinement growth strategy to easily form smart spherical composite with temperature&#8208;responsive function. The composite is successfully produced in kilogram&#8208;scale. The reduced crystals size and the formation of abundant defects endow the composite with an unprecedented high water&#8208;collection efficiency.








Abstract
Water harvesting using the metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;801 is restricted by limited working capacity, powder structuring, and finite stability. To overcome these issues, MOF&#8208;801 is crystallized on the surface of macroporous poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide&#8208;glycidyl methacrylate) spheres, called P(NIPAM&#8208;GMA), through an in situ confined growth strategy, forming spherical MOF&#8208;801@P(NIPAM&#8208;GMA) composite with temperature&#8208;responsive function. By lowering the nucleation energy barrier, the average size of the MOF&#8208;801 crystals decreases by 20 times. Thus, abundant defects as adsorption sites for water can be installed in the crystals lattices. As a consequence, the composite provides an unprecedented high water harvesting efficiency. The composite is produced in the kilogram&#8208;scale and can capture 1.60&#160;kg H2O/kg composite/day from 20% relative humidity between 25 and 85&#160;&#176;C. This study provides an effective methodology for improving the adsorption capacity through controlled defects formation as adsorption sites and to improve the kinetics through the design of a composite with macroporous transport channel network.

         <title>Cyano&#8208;Functionalized Fused Bithiophene Imide Dimer&#8208;Based n&#8208;Type Polymers for High&#8208;Performance Organic Thermoelectrics</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of cyano&#8208;functionalized bithiophene imide dimerbased n&#8208;type polymers are synthesized, featuring good solubility, deep&#8208;lying frontier molecular orbital levels, and favorable polymer chain orientation. By adopting solution&#8208;shearing assisted film&#8208;forming technology, acceptor&#8211;acceptor polymer PCNI2&#8208;BTI delivered a record power factor of 110.3 &#181;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2. The study is informative for development of high&#8208;performance organic thermoelectrics.








Abstract
Doped n&#8208;type polymers usually exhibit low electrical conductivities and thermoelectric power factors (PFs), restricting the development of high&#8208;performance p&#8211;n&#8208;junction&#8208;based organic thermoelectrics (OTEs). Herein, the design and synthesis of a new cyano&#8208;functionalized fused bithiophene imide dimer (f&#8208;BTI2), CNI2, is reported, which synergistically combines the advantages of both cyano and imide functionalities, thus leading to substantially higher electron deficiency than the parent f&#8208;BTI2. On the basis of this novel building block, a series of n&#8208;type donor&#8211;acceptor and acceptor&#8211;acceptor polymers are successfully synthesized, all of which show good solubility, deep&#8208;lying frontier molecular orbital levels, and favorable polymer chain orientation. Among them, the acceptor&#8211;acceptor polymer PCNI2&#8208;BTI delivers an excellent electrical conductivity up to 150.2&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 and a highest PF of 110.3&#160;&#181;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2 in n&#8208;type OTEs, attributed to the optimized polymer electronic properties and film morphology with improved molecular packing and higher crystallinity assisted by solution&#8208;shearing technology. The PF value is the record of n&#8208;type polymers for OTEs to date. This work demonstrates a facile approach to designing high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymers and fabricating high&#8208;quality films for OTE applications.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Assisted Crystallization Enables Large&#8208;Area Perovskite Quasi&#8208;Monocrystalline Film for High&#8208;Sensitive X&#8208;ray Detection and Imaging</title>

A large&#8208;area (10&#8201;cm&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8201;cm) high&#8208;quality quasi&#8208;monocrystalline film (QCF) of mixed&#8208;cation perovskite MA0.42FA0.58PbI3 is achieved via ultrasound&#8208;assisted crystallization combined with the hot&#8208;pressing method. The device based on MA0.42FA0.58PbI3 QCF reaches an impressively high sensitivity of 1.16&#8201;&#215;&#8201;106 &#181;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a low limit of detection of 37.4&#8201;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, demonstrating the high potential toward X&#8208;ray detection and imaging applications.








Abstract
In recent years, halide perovskites have shown great application potential in X&#8208;ray detection due to their superior optoelectronic properties and high X&#8208;ray attenuation coefficient. However, large&#8208;area perovskite fabrication for high performance X&#8208;ray detectors remains extremely challenging. Herein, ultrasound&#8208;assisted crystallization combined with the hot&#8208;pressing method is proposed to prepare large&#8208;area (10&#160;cm &#215; 10&#160;cm) and high&#8208;quality quasi&#8208;monocrystalline thick film of a mixed&#8208;cation perovskite MA0.42FA0.58PbI3. The rapid ultrasound&#8208;assisted crystallization provides more homogeneous nucleation, which is essential to the fabrication of large&#8208;area and uniform perovskite microcrystalline film. Furthermore, the post hot&#8208;pressing treatment is implemented to fuse the crystal boundaries, rearrange the crystal grains, and eliminate the voids between crystals, resulting in a quasi&#8208;monocrystalline film. After the hot&#8208;pressing treatment, the carrier mobility and the carrier mobility&#8208;lifetime product increased about 13&#8208;fold (from 1.8 to 23.5 cm2 s&#8722;1 V&#8722;1) and 18 times (from 8.4 &#215; 10&#8722;6 to 1.5 &#215; 10&#8722;4 cm2 V&#8722;1), respectively. As a result, a high&#8208;performance MA0.42FA0.58PbI3 quasi&#8208;monocrystalline X&#8208;ray detector is achieved with an impressively high sensitivity (1.16 &#215; 106 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) and low detection limit (37.4 nGyair s&#8722;1), demonstrating the potential of the ultrasound&#8208;assisted crystallization and hot&#8208;pressing strategy from an industrial perspective.

         <title>Entering Voltage Hysteresis in Phase&#8208;Separating Materials: Revealing the Electrochemical Signature of the Intraparticle Phase&#8208;Separated State</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phase&#8208;separating material can feature different potentials at the same bulk lithiation level and temperature when exposed to the same finite current within and outside voltage hysteresis. This fundamental material&#8208;related challenge is interrelated to a newly observed electrochemical signature of the intraparticle phase&#8208;separated state featuring different electrode potential compared to the interparticle phase&#8208;separated state.








Abstract
Hysteresis is a general phenomenon regularly observed in various materials. Usually, hysteretic behavior is an intrinsic property that cannot be circumvented in the nonequilibrium operation of the system. Herein, it is shown that, at least with regard to the hysteretic behavior of phase&#8208;separating battery materials, it is possible to enter (deeply) the hysteretic loop at finite battery currents. This newly observed electric response of the electrode, which is inherent to phase&#8208;separating materials, is related to its microscopic origin arising from a (significant) share of the active material residing in an intraparticle phase&#8208;separated state. This intriguing observation is further generalized by revealing that a phase&#8208;separating material can feature (significantly) different chemical potentials at the same bulk lithiation level and temperature when exposed to the same finite current and external voltage hysteresis. Therefore, the intraparticle phase&#8208;separated state significantly affects the DC and AC characteristics of the battery. The experimental evidence for entering the intraparticle phase&#8208;separated state is supported by thermodynamic reasoning and advanced modeling. The current findings will help advance the understanding, control, diagnostics, and monitoring of batteries composed of phase&#8208;separating materials while also providing pertinent motivation for the enhancement of battery design and performance.

         <title>Near&#8208;Theoretical Thermal Conductivity Silver Nanoflakes as Reinforcements in Gap&#8208;Filling Adhesives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D Ag nanoflakes with intrinsic thermal conductivity (398.2&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) close to theoretical value are prepared using the &#8220;top&#8208;down&#8221; method. After directly blending with epoxy (18.6 vol%) without any complex surface modification, hybridization, and structural design, the interfacial heat&#8208;transfer efficiency of the obtained gap&#8208;filling adhesive is &#8776;1.4 times that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art counterpart.








Abstract
The rapid development of highly integrated microelectronic devices causes urgent demands for advanced thermally conductive adhesives (TCAs) to solve the interfacial heat&#8208;transfer issue. Due to their natural 2D structure and isotropic thermal conductivity, metal nanoflakes are promising fillers blended with polymer to develop high&#8208;performance TCAs. However, achieving corresponding TCAs with thermal conductivity over 10&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at filler content below 30 vol% remains challenging so far. This longstanding bottleneck is mainly attributed to the fact that most current metal nanoflakes are prepared by &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; processes (e.g., solution&#8208;based chemical synthesis) and inevitably contain lattice defects or impurities, resulting in lower intrinsic thermal conductivities, only 20&#8211;65% of the theoretical value. Here, a &#8220;top&#8208;down&#8221; strategy by splitting highly purified Ag foil with nanoscale thickness is adopted to prepare 2D Ag nanoflakes with an intrinsic thermal conductivity of 398.2&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, reaching 93% of the theoretical value. After directly blending with epoxy, the resultant Ag/epoxy exhibits a thermal conductivity of 15.1&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at low filler content of 18.6 vol%. Additionally, in practical microelectronic cooling performance evaluations, the interfacial heat&#8208;transfer efficiency of the Ag/epoxy achieves &#8776;1.4 times that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art commercial TCA.

         <title>Immunostimulatory DNA Hydrogel Enhances Protective Efficacy of Nanotoxoids against Bacterial Infection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanotoxoids formulated against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus are embedded into an immunostimulatory DNA hydrogel. When used to vaccinate mice, the resulting nanoparticle&#8211;hydrogel composite effectively elicits antigen&#8208;specific humoral and cellular immune responses. This enhanced immunity enables strong protection against live bacterial infection in models of pneumonia and skin infection.








Abstract
While vaccines have been highly successful in protecting against various infections, there are still many high&#8208;priority pathogens for which there are no clinically approved formulations. To overcome this challenge, researchers have explored the use of nanoparticulate strategies for more effective antigen delivery to the immune system. Along these lines, nanotoxoids are a promising biomimetic platform that leverages cell membrane coating technology to safely deliver otherwise toxic bacterial antigens in their native form for antivirulence vaccination. Here, in order to further boost their immunogenicity, nanotoxoids formulated against staphylococcal &#945;&#8208;hemolysin are embedded into a DNA&#8208;based hydrogel with immunostimulatory CpG motifs. The resulting nanoparticle&#8211;hydrogel composite is injectable and improves the in vivo delivery of vaccine antigens while simultaneously stimulating nearby immune cells. This leads to elevated antibody production and stronger antigen&#8208;specific cellular immune responses. In murine models of pneumonia and skin infection caused by methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus, mice vaccinated with the hybrid vaccine formulation are well&#8208;protected. This work highlights the benefits of combining nanoparticulate antigen delivery systems with immunostimulatory hydrogels into a single platform, and the approach can be readily generalized to a wide range of infectious diseases.

     alt="Immunostimulatory DNA Hydrogel Enhances Protective Efficacy of Nanotoxoids against Bacterial Infection"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanotoxoids formulated against methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; are embedded into an immunostimulatory DNA hydrogel. When used to vaccinate mice, the resulting nanoparticle&#8211;hydrogel composite effectively elicits antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. This enhanced immunity enables strong protection against live bacterial infection in models of pneumonia and skin infection.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While vaccines have been highly successful in protecting against various infections, there are still many high-priority pathogens for which there are no clinically approved formulations. To overcome this challenge, researchers have explored the use of nanoparticulate strategies for more effective antigen delivery to the immune system. Along these lines, nanotoxoids are a promising biomimetic platform that leverages cell membrane coating technology to safely deliver otherwise toxic bacterial antigens in their native form for antivirulence vaccination. Here, in order to further boost their immunogenicity, nanotoxoids formulated against staphylococcal &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-hemolysin are embedded into a DNA-based hydrogel with immunostimulatory CpG motifs. The resulting nanoparticle&#8211;hydrogel composite is injectable and improves the in vivo delivery of vaccine antigens while simultaneously stimulating nearby immune cells. This leads to elevated antibody production and stronger antigen-specific cellular immune responses. In murine models of pneumonia and skin infection caused by methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, mice vaccinated with the hybrid vaccine formulation are well-protected. This work highlights the benefits of combining nanoparticulate antigen delivery systems with immunostimulatory hydrogels into a single platform, and the approach can be readily generalized to a wide range of infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Degeneracy Removal of Spin Bands in Collinear Antiferromagnets with Non&#8208;Interconvertible Spin&#8208;Structure Motif Pair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energy bands in antiferromagnets with compensated magnetization are expected to maintain spin degeneracy without spin&#8211;orbit coupling (SOC). In this work, collinear antiferromagnets with a spin&#8208;structure motif pair are shown,whose components cannot be interconverted by certain spatial transformation; these will show spin splitting. Such a motif&#8208;based rule allows easy discerning of spin&#8208;split antiferromagnets from conventional spin&#8208;degenerate antiferromagnets.








Abstract
Energy bands in antiferromagnets are supposed to be spin degenerate in the absence of spin&#8211;orbit coupling (SOC). Recent studies have identified formal symmetry conditions for antiferromagnetic crystals in which this degeneracy can be lifted, spin splitting,even in the vanishing SOC (i.e., non&#8208;relativistic) limit. Materials having such symmetries could enable spin&#8208;split antiferromagnetic spintronics without the burden of using heavy&#8208;atom compounds. However, the symmetry conditions that involve spin and magnetic symmetry are not always effective as practical material selection filters. Furthermore, these symmetry conditions do not readily disclose trends in the magnitude and momentum dependence of the spin&#8208;splitting energy. Here, it is shown that the formal symmetry conditions enabling spin&#8208;split antiferromagnets can be interpreted in terms of local motif pairs, such as octahedra or tetrahedra, each carrying opposite magnetic moments. Collinear antiferromagnets with such a spin&#8208;structure motif pair, whose components interconvert by neither translation nor spatial inversion, will show spin splitting. Such a real&#8208;space motif&#8208;based approach enables an easy way to identify and design materials (illustrated in real example materials) having spin splitting without the need for SOC, and offers insights into the momentum dependence and magnitude of the spin splitting.

         <title>Data&#8208;Class&#8208;Specific All&#8208;Optical Transformations and Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Data&#8208;class&#8208;specific all&#8208;optical transformations are achieved using a diffractive neural network that is designed by deep learning. Experimentally validated at different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, including near&#8208;infrared and terahertz wavelengths, these class&#8208;specific diffractive optical processors provide a fast and energy&#8208;efficient method for image and data encryption, enhancing data security and privacy.








Abstract
Diffractive optical networks provide rich opportunities for visual computing tasks. Here, data&#8208;class&#8208;specific transformations that are all&#8208;optically performed between the input and output fields&#8208;of&#8208;view (FOVs) of a diffractive network are presented. The visual information of the objects is encoded into the amplitude (A), phase (P), or intensity (I) of the optical field at the input, which is all&#8208;optically processed by a data&#8208;class&#8208;specific diffractive network. At the output, an image sensor&#8208;array directly measures the transformed patterns, all&#8208;optically encrypted using the transformation matrices preassigned to different data classes, i.e., a separate matrix for each data class. The original input images can be recovered by applying the correct decryption key (the inverse transformation) corresponding to the matching data class, while applying any other key will lead to loss of information. All&#8208;optical class&#8208;specific transformations covering A &#8594; A, I &#8594; I, and P &#8594; I transformations using various image datasets are numerically demonstrated. The feasibility of this framework is also experimentally validated by fabricating class&#8208;specific I &#8594; I transformation diffractive networks and is successfully tested at different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, i.e., 1550 nm and 0.75 mm wavelengths. Data&#8208;class&#8208;specific all&#8208;optical transformations provide a fast and energy&#8208;efficient method for image and data encryption, enhancing data security and privacy.

         <title>Continuous Room&#8208;Temperature Spin&#8208;Injection Modulation Achieved by Spin&#8208;Filtering Competition in Molecular Spin Valves</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative spin&#8208;filtering competition strategy is introduced to realize continuous and room&#8208;temperature spin&#8208;injection modulation in molecular spin valves. By precisely controlling the competition, the spin polarization and the magnetoresistance effect can be actively tuned or the sign can even be reversed. Both the experimental and calculation results further enrich the theory of spintronics and may bring novel functionalities.








Abstract
Abundant spin&#8208;related phenomena that originate from interfaces between ferromagnetic electrodes and molecular semiconductors have greatly enriched research in spintronics, and they are considered promising for realizing novel spintronic functionalities in the future. However, despite great effort, the interfacial effect cannot be precisely controlled to achieve steady and predictable functions, especially at room temperature, and this has gradually become a significant bottleneck in the development of molecular spintronics. In this study, an innovative spin&#8208;filtering&#8208;competition mechanism is proposed to continuously modulate the interfacial effect in molecular spin valves at room temperature. To form this novel mechanism, the original spin&#8208;filtering effect from pure cobalt competes with the newly generated one, which is induced by the bonding effect between cobalt and lithium fluoride. Subsequently, by precisely controlling competition through lithium fluoride coverage on the cobalt surface, continuous modulation of the spin&#8208;injection process can be successfully achieved at room temperature. Spin polarization of the injected current and magnetoresistance effect can be actively controlled or their sign can be completely reversed through this novel mechanism. This study provides an innovative approach and theory for precisely controlling spin&#8208;related interfacial effects, which may further promote the scientific and technological development of spintronics.

         <title>Ultracoherent Single&#8208;Electron Emission of Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double barrier structure is demonstrated to form at the carbon nanotube tip, evidenced by a staircase&#8208;like field&#8208;emission curve with equidistant conductance peaks. This enables single&#8208;electron emission with a large current of 1.5&#160;nA, ultralow energy spread of &#8776;10&#160;meV, and ultrasmall effective source radius of &#8776;0.85&#160;nm, paving the way to atomic&#8208;resolution electron microscopy and sub&#8208;10&#160;nm electron beam lithography.








Abstract
A single&#8208;electron emitter, based on a single quantized energy level, can potentially achieve ultimate temporal and spatial coherence with a large emission current, which is desirable for atomic&#8208;resolution electron probes. This is first developed by constructing a nano&#8208;object on a metal tip to form a quantized double barrier structure. However, the single&#8208;electron&#8208;emission current can only achieve a picoampere level due to the low electron tunneling rate of the heterojunction with large barrier width, which limits the practical applications. In this study, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) serve as a single&#8208;electron emitter and a current up to 1.5&#160;nA is demonstrated. The double barrier structure formed on the CNT tip enables a high tunneling rate (&#8776;1012&#160;s&#8722;1) due to the smaller barrier width. The emitter also shows high temporal coherence (energy dispersion of &#8776;10&#160;meV) and spatial coherence (effective source radius of &#8776;0.85&#160;nm). This work represents a highly coherent electron source to simplify the electron optics system of atomic&#8208;resolution electron microscopy and sub&#8208;10&#160;nm electron beam lithography.

         <title>Exchange&#8208;Biased Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect is realized in the magnetic topological insulator Cr&#8208;BST grown on an uncompensated antiferromagnetic insulator Al&#8208;doped Cr2O3. A strong exchange coupling is found to fix interfacial magnetic moments perpendicular and cause an exchange biased QAH effect. The magnitude and sign of the exchange bias are further shown to be controlled by a field training process.








Abstract
The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect is characterized by a dissipationless chiral edge state with a quantized Hall resistance at zero magnetic field. Manipulating the QAH state is of great importance in both the understanding of topological quantum physics and the implementation of dissipationless electronics. Here, the QAH effect is realized in the magnetic topological insulator Cr&#8208;doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 (CBST) grown on an uncompensated antiferromagnetic insulator Al&#8208;doped Cr2O3. Through polarized neutron reflectometry (PNR), a strong exchange coupling is found between CBST and Al&#8208;Cr2O3 surface spins fixing interfacial magnetic moments perpendicular to the film plane. The interfacial coupling results in an exchange&#8208;biased QAH effect. This study further demonstrates that the magnitude and sign of the exchange bias can be effectively controlled using a field training process to set the magnetization of the Al&#8208;Cr2O3 layer. It demonstrates the use of the exchange bias effect to effectively manipulate the QAH state, opening new possibilities in QAH&#8208;based spintronics.

         <title>Laser Derived Electron Transport Layers with Embedded p&#8211;n Heterointerfaces Enabling Planar Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency over 25%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Present work demonstrates an efficient strategy of the particle boundaries (PBs) embedding of multifunctional p&#8208;type semiconducting CdTe nanocrystals for inhibited carrier losses at PBs, which can serve as efficient PBs mediator for boosting the electrons mobility of TiO2 ETL by maximally three orders of magnitude and consequently result in a new benchmark PCE over 25% in planar PSCs.








Abstract
Electron transport layers (ETLs) with pronounced electron conducting capability are essential for high performance planar perovskite photovoltaics, with the great challenge being that the most widely used metal oxide ETLs unfortunately have intrinsically low carrier mobility. Herein is demonstrated that by simply addressing the carrier loss at particle boundaries of TiO2 ETLs, through embedding in ETL p&#8211;n heterointerfaces, the electron mobility of the ETLs can be boosted by three orders of magnitude. Such embedding is encouragingly favorable for both inhibiting the formation of rutile phase TiO2 in ETL, and initiating the growth of high&#8208;quality perovskite films with less defect states. By virtue of these merits, creation of formamidinium lead iodide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with a champion efficiency of 25.05% is achieved, setting a new benchmark for planar PSCs employing TiO2 ETLs. Unencapsulated PSCs deliver much&#8208;improved environmental stability, i.e., more than 80% of their initial efficiency after 9000 h of air storage under RH of 40%, and over 90% of their initial efficiency at maximum power point under continuous illumination for 500 h. Further work exploring other p&#8208;type nanocrystals for embedding warrants the proposed strategy as a universal alternative for addressing the low&#8208;carrier mobility of metal oxide based ETLs.

         <title>Life&#8208;Cycle Assessment of Ti3C2Tx MXene Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A life&#8208;cycle assessment (LCA) of Ti3C2Tx MXene as an EMI&#8208;shielding coating is presented. MXene synthesis, including laboratory&#8208;scale systems and precursor generation utilizing TiO2, is examined for energy demand and environmental impacts. Findings demonstrate that laboratory electricity usage has the greatest impact on MXene production. Sustainable MXene synthesis toward the large&#8208;scale manufacturing of this intriguing 2D material is discussed.








Abstract
MXenes, 2D transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides, have been investigated for diverse applications since their discovery; however, their life&#8208;cycle assessment (LCA) has not been studied. Here, a &#8220;cradle to gate&#8221; LCA is performed to assess the cumulative energy demand (CED) and environmental impacts of lab&#8208;scale synthesis of Ti3C2Tx, the most researched MXene composition. Electromagnetic interface (EMI) shielding is selected as it is one of MXenes' most promising applications and LCA of Ti3C2Tx synthesis is compared to aluminum and copper foils, two typical EMI&#8208;shielding materials. Two laboratory&#8208;scale MXene synthesis systems&#8212;gram and kilogram batches&#8212;are examined. The CED and environmental implications of Ti3C2Tx synthesis are investigated based on its precursor production, selective etching, delamination processes, laboratory location, energy mix, and raw material type. These&#160;results show that laboratory electricity usage for the synthesis processes accounts for &gt;70% of the environmental impacts. Manufacturing 1.0&#160;kg of industrial&#8208;scale aluminum and copper foil releases 23.0&#160;kg and 8.75&#160;kg of CO2, respectively, while 1.0&#160;kg of lab&#8208;scale MXene synthesis releases 428.10&#160;kg. Chemical usage is less impactful than electricity, which suggests that&#160;recycled resources and renewable energy can make MXene synthesis more sustainable. Understanding MXene LCA helps the industrialization of this material.

         <title>Achieving Highly Proton&#8208;Resistant Zn&#8211;Pb Anode through Low Hydrogen Affinity and Strong Bonding for Long&#8208;Life Electrolytic Zn//MnO2 Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pb&#8208;containing interface and Pb layer constructed in situ on a Zn substrate and Zn plating layer provide all&#8208;around protection for stable Zn anodes. Benefiting from the low H+ affinity and strong bonding, they show high hydrogen evolution corrosion resistance. Based on this, an electrolytic Zn//MnO2 battery achieves long&#8208;term cycling stability and ultra&#8208;high energy density in an acidic electrolyte.








Abstract
High&#8208;energy electrolytic Zn//MnO2 batteries show potential for grid&#8208;scale energy storage, but the severe hydrogen evolution corrosion (HEC) caused by acidic electrolytes results in subdued durability. Here, an all&#8208;around protection strategy is reported for achieving stable Zn metal anodes. First, a proton&#8208;resistant Pb&#8208;containing (Pb and Pb(OH)2) interface is constructed on a Zn anode (denoted as Zn@Pb), which in situ forms PbSO4 during H2SO4 corrosion and protects the Zn substrate from HEC. Second, to improve the plating/stripping reversibility of Zn@Pb, Pb(CH3COO)2 an additive (denoted as Zn@Pb&#8208;Ad) is introduced, which triggers PbSO4 precipitation and releases trace Pb2+ that can dynamically deposit a Pb layer on the Zn plating layer to suppress HEC. The superior HEC resistance stems from the low affinity of PbSO4 and Pb for H+, as well as strong bonding between Pb&#8211;Zn or Pb&#8211;Pb, which increase the hydrogen evolution reaction overpotential and the H+ corrosion energy barrier. Consequently, the Zn@Pb&#8208;Ad//MnO2 battery runs stably for 630 and 795&#160;h in 0.2 and 0.1&#160;m H2SO4 electrolytes, respectively, which are &gt;40 times better than that of bare Zn. The as&#8208;prepared A h&#8208;level battery achieves a one&#8208;month calendar life, opening the door to the next generation of high&#8208;durable grid&#8208;scale Zn batteries.

The as-prepared A h-level battery achieves a one-month calendar life, opening the door to the next generation of high-durable grid-scale Zn batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom and Hierarchical&#8208;Pore Aerogel Confinement Strategy for Low&#8208;Platinum Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom and hierarchical&#8208;pore aerogels are used to support intermetallic ordered Pt alloys as oxygen&#8208;reduction&#8208;reaction catalysts for low Pt fuel cells, which can not only substantially reduce oxygen&#8208;related mass&#8208;transport resistance but also has long&#8208;term durability.








Abstract
Achieving high catalytic performance through the lowest possible content of platinum (Pt) is the key to cost reduction of proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). However, lowering the Pt loading in PEMFCs leads to the high mass&#8208;transport resistance of oxygen originating from the limited active sites, and causes less stability of the catalysts due to Pt size growth after long&#8208;time operation. Herein, Pt&#8211;metal/metal&#8211;N&#8211;C aerogel catalysts are designed that substantially reduce oxygen&#8208;related mass transport resistance and have long&#8208;term durability. The tailoring of the Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C aerogel support with hierarchical and interconnecting pores enable a low local oxygen transport resistance (0.18 s cm&#8722;1) for PEMFCs with ultralow Pt loading (50 &#177; 5 &#181;gPt cm&#8722;2). Chemical confinement of Fe&#9472;N sites ensures high stability of the loaded&#8208;Pt both in the processes of synthesis up to 1000 &#176;C and practical application in PEMFCs. The ultralow Pt PEMFC displays a low voltage loss of 8 mV at 0.80 A cm&#8722;2 and unchanged electrochemical surface area after 60 000 cycles of accelerated durability testing. The allying of the hierarchical pores, the aerogel, and the single atoms can fully reflect their structural advantages and expand the understanding for the synthesis of advanced fuel cell PEMFCs catalysts.

         <title>Atomically Unraveling the Structural Evolution of Surfaces and Interfaces in Metal Halide Perovskite Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic imaging of bulk and local structures of CsPbI3 quantum dots (QDs) by integrated differential&#8208;phase&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy is reported. Particularly, the changes in the surface and interface under various external conditions are revealed. The density functional theory calculations are also carried out to explain the relationship between structure and property of CsPbI3 QDs.








Abstract
Revealing the local structural change of metal halide perovskites (MHPs) induced by external conditions is important to understand its performance and stability in optoelectronic applications. However, previous studies on the properties and structures of MHPs are usually limited by the spatial resolution of the probe, and it is still challenging to obtain its atomic structural information in real space. In this work, the integrated differential&#8208;phase&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy is applied to the low&#8208;dose imaging of CsPbI3 quantum dots (QDs). In particular, the local structures in QDs, such as surfaces and interfaces, can be atomically resolved. Then, the structural evolution of CsPbI3 QDs under various external conditions can be unraveled during in situ heating or ex situ treatments, where it lose cubic shapes and fuse to larger particles. The changes in surfaces and interfaces with missing Cs ions and PbI6 octahedrons can be semi&#8208;quantitatively studied by profile analysis and bond&#8208;length measurement in images. Finally, density functional theory calculations are performed to illustrate the properties and stabilities of the different structures that are observed. These results provide atomic&#8208;scale insights into the structural evolution of QDs, which is of great importance to modify the performance of perovskite materials and devices.

         <title>Epoxy Adhesives with Reversible Hardeners: Controllable Thermal Debonding in Bulk and at Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of on&#8208;demand debondable epoxy adhesives showing fast debonding, while staying stable until high temperatures, is reported. In this context, two types of dynamic polyamidoamine curing agents are synthesized and their versatility is demonstrated in classical bulk adhesive formulations, as well as in dynamic covalent linking to functionalized surfaces.








Abstract
On&#8208;demand adhesive dismantling has the potential to improve multimaterial product recycling, but its implementation has been hampered by a critical trade&#8208;off between strong bonding and easy debonding. As a result, the temperature range in which these temporary adhesives can be used is relatively limited. Here, a new class of dynamic epoxy resins is reported that significantly extends this upper temperature limit and still achieves fast debonding. Specifically, two types of dynamic polyamidoamine curing agents for epoxy hardening are&#160;developed, being polysuccinamides (PSA) and polyglutaramides (PGA). As the dynamic debonding/rebonding process of PSA and especially PGA linkages is more thermally demanding and at the same time more thermally robust than previously reported dynamic covalent systems, the resulting materials can be triggered at high temperatures, and at the same time remain bonded over a wide temperature range. The versatility of the PSA and PGA dynamic adhesive curing system is&#160;demonstrated in classical bulk adhesive formulations, as well as in dynamic covalent linking to a PSA&#8208; or PGA&#8208;functionalized surface. As a result, an attractive drop&#8208;in strategy is&#160;achieved for producing debondable and rebondable epoxy adhesives, with high complementarity to existing adhesive resin technologies and applicable in an industrially relevant temperature window.

Fe93.5Si6.5 (wt%) toroidal cores with tailored structures fabricated by electron beam powder bed fusion using specifically developed hatching strategies (i.e., radial hatching and circle hatching) show promising magnetic properties (i.e., low power losses&#160;and high maximum magnetic flux density), outperforming some soft magnetic materials produced by conventional techniques and laser powder bed fusion.








Abstract
Fe93.5Si6.5 (wt%) soft magnetic materials in toroidal shape are additively manufactured by means of electron beam powder bed fusion (PBF&#8208;EB). Different hatching strategies are applied to realize specific patterns of molten material alternating with non&#8208;molten powder particles. The specimens produced using different hatching strategies show identical relative densities but various structural features resulting in different magnetic properties. The magnetic performance of the specimens is characterized by determining hysteresis loops (B&#8211;H curves), power losses, and maximum magnetic flux density at frequencies between 50 and 1000&#160;Hz. At constant mass, the different structures induced by using various hatching strategies have a strong influence on the hysteresis losses. These losses can be significantly reduced by applying a targeted structure design. The modified specimens show superior magnetic properties at sub&#8208;kHz compared to some soft magnetic materials fabricated by means of conventional methods and laser powder bed fusion (PBF&#8208;L).

         <title>Carbonization&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Dependent Electrical Properties of Carbon Nanofibers&#8212;From Nanoscale to Macroscale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microscopic electrical analysis of carbon nanofiber (CNF) networks reveals a homogeneous current distribution. However, high&#8208;resolution analysis of individual fibers exhibits heterogeneities. A significant CNF surface fraction is highly resistive, representing a severe limitation for the overall conductivity. The conductive surface domains of individual fibers increase with raising carbonization temperature. Microscopic and macroscopic electrical behavior correlates strongly.








Abstract
An exact understanding of the conductivity of individual fibers and their networks is crucial to tailor the overall macroscopic properties of polyacrylonitrile (PAN)&#8208;based carbon nanofibers (CNFs). Therefore, microelectrical properties of CNF networks and nanoelectrical properties of individual CNFs, carbonized at temperatures from 600 to 1000 &#176;C, are studied by means of conductive atomic force microscopy (C&#8208;AFM). At the microscale, the CNF networks show good electrical interconnections enabling a homogeneously distributed current flow. The network's homogeneity is underlined by the strong correlation of macroscopic conductivities, determined by the four&#8208;point&#8208;method, and microscopic results. Both, microscopic and macroscopic electrical properties, solely depend on the carbonization temperature and the exact resulting fiber structure. Strikingly, nanoscale high&#8208;resolution current maps of individual CNFs reveal a large highly resistive surface fraction, representing a clear limitation. Highly resistive surface domains are either attributed to disordered highly resistive carbon structures at the surface or the absence of electron percolation paths in the bulk volume. With increased carbonization temperature, the conductive surface domains grow in size resulting in a higher conductivity. This work contributes to existing microstructural models of CNFs by extending them by electrical properties, especially electron percolation paths.

         <title>Periodic and Aperiodic NiFe Nanomagnet/Ferrimagnet Hybrid Structures for 2D Magnon Steering and Interferometry with High Extinction Ratio</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Periodic and aperiodic NiFe nanopillars with engineered resonances excite magnons down to 49 nm wavelength in underlying yttrium iron garnet when irradiated by GHz signals. Multidirectional steering and interferometry of coherently scattered magnons between three coplanar waveguides provide record extinction ratios over macroscopic distances. The properties are key to establish efficient magnon&#8208;based computing and nanoscale neural networks.








Abstract
Magnons, quanta of spin waves, are known to enable information processing with low power consumption at the nanoscale. So far, however, experimentally realized half&#8208;adders, wave&#8208;logic, and binary output operations are based on few &#181;m&#8208;long spin waves and restricted to one spatial direction. Here, magnons with wavelengths &#955; down to 50 nm in ferrimagnetic Y3Fe5O12 below 2D lattices of periodic and aperiodic ferromagnetic nanopillars are explored. Due to their high rotational symmetries and engineered magnetic resonances, the lattices allow short&#8208;wave magnons to propagate in arbitrarily chosen on&#8208;chip directions when excited by conventional coplanar waveguides. Performing interferometry with magnons over macroscopic distances of 350 &#215; &#955; without loss of coherency, unprecedentedly high extinction ratios of up to 26 (&#177;8) dB [31 (&#177;2) dB] for a binary 1/0 output operation at &#955; = 69&#160;nm (&#955; = 154&#160;nm) are achieved in this work. The reported findings and design criteria for 2D magnon interferometry are particularly important in view of the realization of complex neuronal networks recently proposed for interfering spin waves underneath&#160;nanomagnets.

         <title>A &#960;&#8208;Bridge Spacer Embedded Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Polymer for Flexible Electrochromic Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;&#960;&#8208;bridge spacer&#8221;&#8208;embedded electron donor&#8211;acceptor polymer cathode combined with Zn2+&#8211;ion&#8208;conducting gel electrolyte is proposed for a smart and flexible Zn&#8211;ion batteries to provide high electrochromic&#8211;electrochemical performances. The &#960;&#8208;bridge spacer endows the polymeric skeleton with improved physical ion accessibility and sensitive charge transfer through the charging&#8211;discharging cycles, providing extremely stable cyclability with high specific capacity.








Abstract
Zinc&#8211;ion batteries (ZIBs) have drawn much attention for next&#8208;generation energy storage for smart and wearable electronics due to their high theoretical gravimetric/volumetric energy capacities, safety from explosive hazards, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ZIBs lack the energy capacity necessary to facilitate smart functionalities for intelligent electronics. In this work, a &#8220;&#960;&#8208;bridge spacer&#8221;&#8208;embedded electron donor&#8211;acceptor polymer cathode combined with a Zn2+&#8211;ion&#8208;conducting electrolyte is proposed for a smart and flexible ZIB to provide high electrochromic&#8211;electrochemical performances. The &#960;&#8208;bridge spacer endows the polymeric skeleton with improved physical ion accessibility and sensitive charge transfer through&#160;the cycles, providing extremely stable cyclability with high specific capacity (110 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1) at very fast rates (8 A&#160;g&#8722;1) and large coloration efficiency (79.8 cm2&#160;C&#8722;1) under severe mechanical deformation over a long period. These results are markedly outstanding compared to the topological analogue without the &#960;&#8208;bridge spacer (80 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at current density of 8 A&#160;g&#8722;1, 63.0 cm2&#160;C&#8722;1). The design to incorporate a &#960;&#8208;bridge spacer realizes notable electrochromism behaviors and high electrochemical performance, which sheds light on the rational development of multifunctional flexible&#8208;ZIBs with color visualization properties for widespread usage in powering smart electronics.

         <title>Surface Restructuring of Zeolite&#8208;Encapsulated Halide Perovskite to Activate Lattice Oxygen Oxidation for Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
MAPbX3 nanocrystals confined in zeolite are the first application to efficient oxygen electrocatalysis in aqueous solution via host&#8211;guest assembly. The absence of phase segregation and halide migration in halide perovskite MAPbBr3 results in markedly improved diffusion of OH&#8722; ions and ultimately leads to the optimal OER activity of MAPbBr3@AlPO&#8208;5 composite.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;halide perovskites possess great potential for electrochemical water splitting that has not been realized due to their intolerance to water. Here, methylammonium lead halide perovskites (MAPbX3) are used to electrocatalyze water oxidation in aqueous electrolytes by creating MAPbX3@AlPO&#8208;5 host&#8211;guest composites. Due to the protective feature of the zeolite matrix, halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) confined in aluminophosphate AlPO&#8208;5 zeolites achieve an excellent stability in water. The resultant electrocatalyst undergoes dynamic surface restructuring during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the formation of an edge&#8208;sharing &#945;&#8208;PbO2 active layer. The existence of charge&#8208;transfer interactions at the MAPbX3/&#945;&#8208;PbO2 interface significantly modulates the surface electron density of the &#945;&#8208;PbO2 and optimizes the adsorption free energy of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediate species. Furthermore, the soft&#8208;lattice nature of halide perovskites enables more facile triggering of lattice&#8208;oxygen oxidation of nanostructured &#945;&#8208;PbO2, exhibiting pH&#8208;dependent OER activity and non&#8208;concerted proton&#8208;electron transfer for MAPbX3@AlPO&#8208;5 composite. As a result, the developed MAPbBr3@AlPO&#8208;5 composite manifests an ultralow overpotential of 233&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in 1&#160;m KOH. These findings offer facile access to halide perovskite applied to water electrolysis with enhanced intrinsic activity, providing a new paradigm for designing high&#8208;efficiency OER electrocatalysts.

         <title>Supramolecular Photothermal Cascade Nano&#8208;Reactor Enables Photothermal Effect, Cascade Reaction, and In Situ Hydrogelation for Biofilm&#8208;Associated Tooth&#8208;Extraction Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular photothermal cascade nano&#8208;reactor is constructed through a facile and efficient strategy. The supramolecular photothermal cascade reactor can realize synergistic antibacterial therapy. Moreover, combined with the process of hydrogelation in situ initiated by the cascade reaction, the supramolecular photothermal cascade reaction system is applied to treat infection in tooth&#8208;extraction wounds, significantly promoting the wound healing process.








Abstract
Due to the emergence of drug resistance in bacteria and biofilm protection, achieving a satisfactory therapeutic effect for bacteria&#8208;infected open wounds with conventional measures is problematic. Here, a photothermal cascade nano&#8208;reactor (CPNC@GOx&#8208;Fe2+) is constructed through a supramolecular strategy through hydrogen bonding and coordination interactions between chitosan&#8208;modified palladium nano&#8208;cube (CPNC), glucose oxidase (GOx), and ferrous iron (Fe2+). CPNC@GOx&#8208;Fe2+ exhibits excellent photothermal effects and powers the GOx&#8208;assisted cascade reaction to generate hydroxyl radicals, enabling photothermal and chemodynamic combination therapy against bacteria and biofilms. Further proteomics, metabolomics, and all&#8208;atom simulation results indicate that the damage of the hydroxyl radical to the function and structure of the cell membrane and the thermal effect enhance the fluidity and inhomogeneity of the bacterial cell membrane, resulting in the synergistic antibacterial effect. In the biofilm&#8208;associated tooth extraction wound model, the hydroxyl radical generated from the cascade reaction process can initiate the radical polymerization process to form a hydrogel in situ for wound protection. In vivo experiments confirm that synergistic antibacterial and wound protection can accelerate the healing of infected tooth&#8208;extraction wounds without affecting the oral commensal microbiota. This study provides a way to propose a multifunctional supramolecular system for the treatment of open wound infection.

         <title>Video&#8208;Rate Switching of High&#8208;Reflectivity Hybrid Cavities Spanning All Primary Colors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid nanocavities are utilized as tunable color pixels to generate high reflectance (&gt;40%) colors while retaining video refresh rates and energy consumption far below all existing display technologies.








Abstract
Dynamically tunable reflective structural colors are attractive for reflective displays (electronic paper). However, it is challenging to tune a thin layer of structural color across the full red&#8211;green&#8211;blue (RGB) basis set of colors at video rates and with long&#8208;term stability. In this work, this is achieved through a hybrid cavity built from metal&#8211;insulator&#8211;metal (MIM) &#8220;nanocaves&#8221; and an electrochromic polymer (PProDOTMe2). The reflective colors are modulated by electrochemically doping/dedoping the polymer. Compared with traditional subpixel&#8208;based systems, this hybrid structure provides high reflectivity (&gt;40%) due to its &#8220;monopixel&#8221; nature and switches at video rates. The polymer bistability helps deliver ultralow power consumption (&#8776;2.5&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2) for video display applications and negligible consumption (&#8776;3&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2) for static images, compatible with fully photovoltaic powering. In addition, the color uniformity of the hybrid material is excellent (over cm&#8722;2) and the scalable fabrication enables large&#8208;area production.

         <title>Renally Clearable Ultraminiature Chain&#8208;Like Gold Nanoparticle Clusters for Multimodal Molecular Imaging of Choroidal Neovascularization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first&#8208;of&#8208;its&#8208;kind multifunctional ultraminiature chain&#8208;like gold nanoparticle clusters (GNCs) are developed via self&#8208;assembly of 7&#8211;8&#160;nm spherical GNP monomers, the GNCs provides redshifted optical absorption and scattering contrasts in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) window which is highly desired by optical imaging modalities such as photoacoustic (PA) imaging and optical coherence tomography (OCT). After disassembly, the GNCs turn back into ultraminiature GNPs with a size smaller than the renal glomerular filtration size cutoff, allowing them to be excreted via urine instead of being trapped in the liver and spleen. Renally clearable ultraminiature GNCs facilitate long&#8208;term multimodal molecular imaging of choroidal neovascularization in vivo.








Abstract
Currently, available gold nanoparticles (GNPs) typically accumulate in the liver and spleen, leading to concerns for their long&#8208;term biosafety. To address this long&#8208;standing problem, ultraminiature chain&#8208;like gold nanoparticle clusters (GNCs) are developed. Via self&#8208;assembly of 7&#8211;8&#160;nm GNP monomers, GNCs provide redshifted optical absorption and scattering contrast in the near&#8208;infrared window. After disassembly, GNCs turn back to GNPs with a size smaller than the renal glomerular filtration size cutoff, allowing their&#160;excretion via urine. A one&#8208;month longitudinal study in a rabbit eye model demonstrates that GNCs facilitate multimodal molecular imaging of choroidal neovascularization (CNV)&#160;in vivo, non&#8208;invasively, with excellent sensitivity and spatial resolution. GNCs targeting &#945;v&#946;3&#160;integrins enhance photoacoustic and optical coherence tomography (OCT) signals from CNV by 25.3&#8208;fold and 150%, respectively. With excellent biosafety and biocompatibility demonstrated,&#160;GNCs render a first&#8208;of&#8208;its&#8208;kind nanoplatform for biomedical imaging.

         <title>NiSi: A New Venue for Antiferromagnetic Spintronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of high&#8208;temperature antiferromagnetism in NiSi with TN &#10878; 700 K is reported. The antiferromagnetism is accompanied by a small uncompensated ferromagnetic component, which can be independently tuned by a small magnetic field, resulting in a one&#8208;step magnetic switching transition. Thus, a new venue for spintronics research is envisaged in this technologically important material.








Abstract
Envisaging antiferromagnetic spintronics pivots on two key criteria of high transition temperature and tuning of underlying magnetic order using straightforward application of magnetic field or electric current. Here, it is shown that NiSi metal can provide suitable new platform in this quest. First, the study unveils high&#8208;temperature antiferromagnetism in single&#8208;crystal NiSi with N&#233;el temperature, TN &#10878; 700 K. Antiferromagnetic order in NiSi is accompanied by non&#8208;centrosymmetric magnetic character with small ferromagnetic component in the a&#8211;c plane. Second, it is found that NiSi manifests distinct magnetic and electronic hysteresis responses to field applications due to the disparity in two moment directions. While magnetic hysteresis is characterized by one&#8208;step switching between ferromagnetic states of uncompensated moment, electronic behavior is ascribed to metamagnetic switching phenomena between non&#8208;collinear spin configurations. Importantly, the switching behaviors persist to high temperature. The properties underscore the importance of NiSi in the pursuit of antiferromagnetic&#160;spintronics.

         <title>Efficient and Stable Quasi&#8208;2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskite Solar Cells by Tailoring Crystal Orientation and Passivating Surface Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple solution&#8208;processable passivator is introduced on the top surface of low&#8208;dimensional 2D perovskites. This passivator induces a vertical crystal orientation and simultaneously passivates the defects on the perovskites, leading to efficient charge transport with reduced recombination loss in the photoactive materials. The champion device exhibits a power conversion efficiency of 20.05% with negligible hysteresis and superior operational stability.








Abstract
Solar cells (PSCs) with quasi&#8208;2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites (RPP) exhibit greater environmental stability than 3D perovskites; however, the low power conversion efficiency (PCE) caused by anisotropic crystal orientations and defect sites in the bulk RPP materials limit future commercialization. Herein, a simple post&#8211;treatment is reported for the top surfaces of RPP thin films (RPP composition of PEA2MA4Pb5I16 &lt;n&gt; = 5) in which zwitterionic n&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;phenylnitrone (PBN) is used as the passivation material. The PBN molecules passivate the surface and grain boundary defects in the RPP and simultaneously induce vertical direction crystal orientations of the RPPs, which lead to efficient charge transport in the RPP photoactive materials. With this surface engineering methodology, the optimized devices exhibit a remarkably enhanced PCE of 20.05% as compared with the devices without PBN (&#8776;17.53%) and excellent long&#8208;term operational stability with 88% retention of the initial PCE under continuous 1&#8208;sun irradiation for over 1000&#160;h. The proposed passivation strategy provides new insights into the development of efficient and stable RPP&#8208;based PSCs.

&lt;p&gt;A simple solution-processable passivator is introduced on the top surface of low-dimensional 2D perovskites. This passivator induces a vertical crystal orientation and simultaneously passivates the defects on the perovskites, leading to efficient charge transport with reduced recombination loss in the photoactive materials. The champion device exhibits a power conversion efficiency of 20.05% with negligible hysteresis and superior operational stability.

         <title>Post&#8208;Maturation Reinforcement of 3D&#8208;Printed Vascularized Cardiac Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for reinforcing fully cellularized tissue is shown. Vascularized cardiac tissues are printed. Following tissue maturation, a biocompatible, tissue&#8208;penetrating small&#8208;molecule is deployed to generate significant improvement in the tissue's mechanical properties.








Abstract
Despite advances in biomaterials engineering, a large gap remains between the weak mechanical properties that can be achieved with natural materials and the strength of synthetic materials. Here, a method is presented for reinforcing an engineered cardiac tissue fabricated from differentiated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and an extracellular matrix (ECM)&#8208;based hydrogel in a manner that is fully biocompatible. The reinforcement occurs as a post&#8208;fabrication step, which allows for the use of 3D&#8208;printing technology to generate thick, fully cellularized, and vascularized cardiac tissues. After tissue assembly and during the maturation process in a soft hydrogel, a small, tissue&#8208;penetrating reinforcer is deployed, leading to a significant increase in the tissue's mechanical properties. The tissue's robustness is demonstrated by injecting the tissue in a simulated minimally invasive procedure and showing that the tissue is functional and undamaged at the nano&#8208;, micro&#8208;, and macroscales.

         <title>Lubricated Interfaces Enabling Simultaneous Pulsatile and Continuous Chemical Release Modes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The loading of chemicals in a porous polymeric coating prior to lubrication leads to a diffusion&#8208;based continuous release of chemicals, whereas the loading of dissolved water&#8208;soluble chemicals that disperse in the lubricated liquid crystals in the form of micrometer&#8208;sized aqueous droplets gives rise to a pulsatile release triggered by a liquid crystal phase transition.








Abstract
The release of chemicals following either pulsatile or continuous release modes is important for various potential applications, including programmed chemical reactions, mechanical actuation, and treatments of various diseases. However, the simultaneous application of both modes in a single material system has been challenging. Here, two chemical loading methods are reported in a liquid&#8208;crystal&#8208;infused porous surface (LCIPS) that enables both a pulsatile and continuous release of chemicals simultaneously. Specifically, chemicals loaded in the porous substrate exhibit a liquid crystal (LC) mesophase&#8208;dependent continuous release, whereas the chemicals dissolved in micrometer&#8208;sized aqueous droplets dispersed in the LC surface follow a pulsatile release activated by a phase transition. Moreover, the loading method of distinct molecules can be controlled to program their release mode. Finally, the pulsatile and continuous release of two distinct bioactive small molecules, tetracycline and dexamethasone, are demonstrated which display antibacterial and immunomodulatory activities for applications such as chronic wound healing and biomedical implant coating.

         <title>Low&#8208;Power and Field&#8208;Free Perpendicular Magnetic Memory Driven by Topological Insulators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the assistance of a small STT current across the MTJ stack during SOT, field&#8208;free deterministic SOT switching is realized, and the critical switching current density of SOT decreases with increasing the STT current density. TI&#8208;pMTJ devices with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy have much higher thermal stability and much lower switching current density, to realize SOT&#8208;MRAM applications.








Abstract
Giant spin&#8211;orbit torque (SOT) from topological insulators (TIs) has great potential for low&#8208;power SOT&#8208;driven magnetic random&#8208;access memory (SOT&#8208;MRAM). In this work, a functional 3&#8208;terminal SOT&#8208;MRAM device is demonstrated by integrating the TI [(BiSb)2Te3] with perpendicular magnetic tunnel junctions (pMTJs), where the tunneling magnetoresistance is employed for the effective reading method. An ultralow switching current density of 1.5 &#215; 105&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 is achieved in the TI&#8208;pMTJ device at room temperature, which is 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude lower than that in conventional heavy&#8211;metals&#8208;based systems, due to the high SOT efficiency &#952;SH = 1.16 of (BiSb)2Te3. Furthermore, all&#8208;electrical field&#8208;free writing is realized by the synergistic effect of a small spin&#8208;transfer torque current during the SOT. The thermal stability factor (&#916; = 66) shows the high retention time (&gt;10 years) of the TI&#8208;pMTJ device. This work sheds light to the future low&#8208;power, high&#8208;density, and high&#8208;endurance/retention magnetic memory technology based on quantum materials.

         <title>Molybdenum Disulfide Nanoribbons with Enhanced Edge Nonlinear Response and Photoresponsivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) single&#8208;nanoribbon photodetectors are successfully demonstrated. The MoS2 nanoribbons grown using a dual pulsed laser deposition&#8208;chemical vapor deposition approach exhibit single&#8208;layer edges with enhanced nonlinear optical response and photoluminescence emission. The photoresponsivity of the nano&#8208;photodetector device reaches a value of 8.72&#160;&#215;&#160;102&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 at visible wavelengths.








Abstract
MoS2 nanoribbons have attracted increased interest due to their properties, which can be tailored by tuning their dimensions. Herein, the growth of MoS2 nanoribbons and triangular crystals formed by the reaction between films of MoOx (2&lt;x&lt;3)&#160;grown by pulsed laser deposition and NaF in a sulfur&#8208;rich environment is demonstrated. The nanoribbons can reach up to 10&#160;&#181;m in length, and feature single&#8208;layer&#160;edges, forming a monolayer&#8211;multilayer junction enabled by the lateral modulation in thickness. The single&#8208;layer edges show a pronounced second harmonic generation due to the symmetry breaking, in contrast to the centrosymmetric multilayer structure, which is unsusceptible to the second&#8208;order nonlinear process. A splitting of the Raman spectra is observed in MoS2 nanoribbons arising from distinct contributions from the single&#8211;layer edges and multilayer core. Nanoscale imaging reveals a blue&#8208;shifted exciton emission of the monolayer edge compared to the isolated MoS2 monolayers due to built&#8208;in local strain and disorder. We&#160;further report on an ultrasensitive photodetector made of a single MoS2 nanoribbon with a responsivity of 8.72&#160;&#215;&#160;102&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 at 532&#160;nm, among the highest reported up&#8208;to&#8208;date for single&#8208;nanoribbon photodetectors. These findings can inspire the design of MoS2 semiconductors with tunable geometries for efficient optoelectronic devices.

Nanoscale imaging reveals a blue-shifted exciton emission of the monolayer edge compared to the isolated MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; monolayers due to built-in local strain and disorder. We&#160;further report on an ultrasensitive photodetector made of a single MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoribbon with a responsivity of 8.72&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;A&#160;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 532&#160;nm, among the highest reported up-to-date for single-nanoribbon photodetectors. These findings can inspire the design of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; semiconductors with tunable geometries for efficient optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Carbon Dots with Blue&#8208;to&#8208;Near&#8208;Infrared Lasing for Colorful Speckle&#8208;Free Laser Imaging and Dynamical Holographic Display</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tunable lasers span 238&#160;nm across from blue to near&#8208;infrared region are realized from full&#8208;color carbon dots (FC&#8208;CDs) in a mirrorless system. The lasers of the FC&#8208;CDs show high Q&#8208;factors, considerable gain coefficients, and better stability than common commercial organic dyes. Finally, high&#8208;quality, colorful speckle&#8208;free laser imaging and dynamic holographic display are successfully demonstrated using these lasers as light sources.








Abstract
As a new solution&#8208;processable laser material, carbon dots (CDs) offer advantages of non&#8208;toxicity, low&#8208;cost, and high&#8208;stability, which are conducive to the sustainable development of miniaturized lasers. Full&#8208;color CDs (FC&#8208;CDs) with bright&#8208;blue, green, yellow, red, deep&#8208;red, and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence are prepared. Their photoluminescence emission ranges from 431 to 714&#160;nm. The FC&#8208;CDs show narrow full widths at half maximum in the range of 44&#8211;76&#160;nm, with concurrent high radiative transition rates (KR) of 0.54&#8211;1.74 &#215; 108&#160;s&#8722;1; their performance is comparable to that of organic laser dyes, indicating their good gain potential for lasers. Laser pumping of the FC&#8208;CDs gives laser outputs at 467.3, 533.5, 577.4, 616.3, 653.5, and 705.1&#160;nm, spanning from blue to NIR region, and covering 140% of the NTSC color gamut. The FC&#8208;CDs show high Q&#8208;factors (2000&#8211;5500), appreciable gain coefficients (9&#8211;21.5&#160;cm&#8722;1), and better stability (&#8776;100%@4&#8211;7&#160;h) than commercial laser dyes. These excellent properties make them suitable for high&#8208;quality, colorful, speckle&#8208;free laser imaging and dynamic holographic display. The findings will be helpful in promoting the practical applications and development of solution&#8208;processable CD&#8208;based lasers.

         <title>Gradient Cationic Vacancies Enabling Inner&#8208;To&#8208;Outer Tandem Homojunctions: Strong Local Internal Electric Field and Reformed Basic Sites Boosting CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gradient cation (W6+) vacancies on the surface of Bi2WO6 nanosheets construct a local intrinsic electric field across the catalyst subsurface, which provides a driving force for the separation of photogenerated carriers. The W6+ vacancies also change the basic sites on the surface and the type of CO2 adsorption, thus lowering the barrier for the formation of the essential intermediate *COOH in the CO2 conversion process and ultimately improving the CO2 reduction ability.








Abstract
The slow charge dynamics and large activation energy of CO2 severely hinder the efficiency of CO2 photoreduction. Defect engineering is a well&#8208;established strategy, while the function of common zero&#8208;dimensional defects is always restricted to promoting surface adsorption. In this work, a gradient layer of tungsten vacancies with a thickness of 3&#8211;4&#160;nm is created across Bi2WO6 nanosheets. This gradient layer&#160;enables the formation of an inner&#8208;to&#8208;outer tandem homojunction with an internal electric field, which provides a strong driving force for the migration of photoelectrons from the bulk to the surface. Meanwhile, W vacancies change the coordination environment around O and W atoms, leading to an alteration in the basic sites and the mode of CO2 adsorption from weak/strong adsorption to moderate adsorption, which ultimately decreases the formation barrier of the key intermediate *COOH and facilitates the conversion thermodynamics for CO2. Without any cocatalyst and sacrificial reagent, W&#8208;vacant Bi2WO6 shows an outstanding photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance with a CO production rate of 30.62&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, being one of the best catalysts in similar reaction systems. This study reveals that gradient vacancies as a new type of defect will show huge potential in regulating charge dynamics and catalytic reaction thermodynamics.

         <title>Nanoengineered Design of inside&#8208;Heating Hot Nanoreactor Surrounded by Cool Environment for Selective Hydrogenations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;function nanocatalyst, integrating locally inside&#8208;heating, thermal insulation, and high&#8208;dispersed Pt into a whole, induces selective hydrogenations within heat&#8208;constrained nanoreactors (120&#160;&#176;C) surrounded by a cool environment (40&#160;&#176;C). A 20.1&#8208;fold increase in reaction rate is achieved compared to the conventional outside&#8208;in heating. The diffusion of target products into a cool environment ensures the high selectivity (&gt;98%) under high conversion (&#8776;100%).








Abstract
Catalysts with designable intelligent nanostructure may potentially drive the changes in chemical reaction techniques. Herein, a multi&#8208;function integrating nanocatalyst, Pt&#8208;containing magnetic yolk&#8208;shell carbonaceous structure, having catalysis function, microenvironment heating, thermal&#160;insulation, and elevated pressure into a whole is designed, which induces selective hydrogenation within heating&#8208;constrained nanoreactors surrounded by ambient environment.&#160;As a demonstration, carbonyl of &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes/ketones are selectively hydrogenated to unsaturated alcohols with a &gt;98% selectivity at a nearly complete conversion under mild conditions of 40&#160;&#176;C and 3&#160;bar instead of harsh requirements of 120&#160;&#176;C and 30&#160;bar. It is creatively demonstrated that the locally increased temperature and endogenous pressure (estimated as &#8776;120&#160;&#176;C, 9.7&#160;bar) in the nano&#8208;sized space greatly facilitate the reaction kinetics under an alternating magnetic field. The outward&#8208;diffused products to the &#8220;cool environment&#8221; remain thermodynamically stable, avoiding the over&#8208;hydrogenation that often occurs under constantly heated conditions of 120&#160;&#176;C. Regulation of the electronic state of Pt by sulfur doping of carbon allows selective chemical adsorption of the &#63743;C&#63742;O group and consequently leads to selective hydrogenation. It is expected that such a multi&#8208;function integrated catalyst provides an ideal platform for precisely operating a variety of organic liquid&#8208;phase transformations under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Ferroelectric Modulation in Flexible Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Schottky Direct&#8208;Current Nanogenerator for Capsule&#8208;Like Magnetic Suspension Sensor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a flexible and dynamic ferroelectric lead&#8208;free halide perovskite (3,3&#8208;difluorocyclobutylammonium)2CuCl4 ((DF&#8208;CBA)2CuCl4)/Al Schottky junction tribovoltaic nanogenerator with high current output (93&#160;&#181;A) at the macroscale. More significantly, a stable and efficient ferroelectricity&#8208;modulated strategy, for the first time, is proposed, which realizes a 15&#8208;fold current enhancement via the electric poling field control.








Abstract
The tribovoltaic nanogenerator (TVNG), a promising semiconductor energy technology, displays outstanding advantages such as low matching impedance and continuous direct&#8208;current output. However, the lack of controllable and stable performance modulation strategies is still a major bottleneck that impedes further practical applications of TVNG. Herein, by leveraging the ferroelectricity&#8208;enhanced mechanism and the control of interfacial energy band bending, a lead&#8208;free perovskite&#8208;based (3,3&#8208;difluorocyclobutylammonium)2CuCl4 ((DF&#8208;CBA)2CuCl4)/Al Schottky junction TVNG is constructed. The multiaxial ferroelectricity of (DF&#8208;CBA)2CuCl4 enables an excellent surface charge modulating capacity, realizing a high work function regulation of &#8776;0.7&#160;eV and over 15&#8208;fold current regulation (from 6 to 93&#160;&#181;A) via an electrical poling control. The controllable electrical poling leads to elevated work function difference between the Al electrode and (DF&#8208;CBA)2CuCl4 compared to traditional semiconductors and halide perovskites, which creates a stronger built&#8208;in electric field at the Schottky interface to enhance the electrical output. This TVNG device exhibits outstanding flexibility and long&#8208;term stability (&gt;20&#160;000 cycles) that can endure extreme mechanical deformations, and can also be used in a capsule&#8208;like magnetic suspension device capable of detecting vibration and weights of different objects as well as harvesting energy from human motions and water waves.

         <title>Switching Chirality in Arrays of Shape&#8208;Reconfigurable Spindle Microparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microarrays consisting of individual shape&#8208;changeable microparticles with anisotropic and uniform&#8208;sized shapes enable symmetry breaking from achiral to chiral (with opposite signs) upon heating or light illumination. Chiral states at the boundary of the achiral/chiral domains are controllably created. This study will lead to rich structures and novel physics emerging from the interplay of symmetry and topology at the light&#8211;matter interface.








Abstract
The giant circular photo&#8208;galvanic effect is realized in chiral metals when illuminated by circularly polarized light. However, the structure itself is not switchable nor is the crystal chirality in the adjacent chiral domains. Here spindle&#8208;shaped liquid crystalline elastomer microparticles that can switch from prolate to spherical to oblate reversibly upon heating above the nematic to isotropic transition temperature are synthesized. When arranged in a honeycomb lattice, the continuous shape change of the microparticles leads to lattice reconfiguration, from a right&#8208;handed chiral state to an achiral one, then to a left&#8208;handed chiral state, without breaking the translational symmetry. Accordingly, the sign of rotation of the polarized light passing through the lattices changes as measured by time&#8208;domain terahertz spectroscopy. Further, it can locally alter the chirality in the adjacent domains using near&#8208;infrared light illumination. The reconfigurable chiral microarrays will allow us to explore non&#8208;trivial symmetry&#8208;protected transport modes of topological lattices at the light&#8211;matter interface. Specifically, the ability to controllably create chiral states at the boundary of the achiral/chiral domains will lead to rich structures emerging from the interplay of symmetry and topology.

         <title>Interface Modification for Efficient and Stable Inverted Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of Pb&#8211;S bonds between perovskite and 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1&#8208;methylimidazole appreciably reduces surface trap and improves interfacial energy level alignment. The open circuit voltage of inverted inorganic perovskite solar cells is enhanced by 120 mV, yielding a power conversion efficiency of 20.6%, along with improved ambient stability.








Abstract
Due to their excellent thermal stability and ideal bandgap, metal halide inorganic perovskite based solar cells (PSCs) with inverted structure are considered as an excellent choice for perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of inverted inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) still lags far behind that of conventional n&#8211;i&#8211;p PSCs due to interfacial energy level mismatch and high nonradiative charge recombination. Herein, the performance of inverted PSCs is significantly improved by interfacial engineering of CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx films with 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1&#8208;methylimidazole (MMI). It is found that the mercapto group can preferably react with the undercoordinated Pb2+ from perovskite by forming Pb&#8211;S bonds, which appreciably reduces the surface trap density. Moreover, MMI modification results in a better energy level alignment with the electron&#8208;transporting material, promoting carrier transfer and reducing voltage deficit. The above combination results in an open&#8208;circuit voltage enhancement by 120&#160;mV, yielding a champion PCE of 20.6% for 0.09 cm2 area and 17.3% for 1 cm2 area. Furthermore, the ambient, operational and heat stabilities of inorganic PSCs with MMI modification are also greatly improved. The work demonstrates a simple but effective approach for fabricating highly efficient and stable inverted inorganic PSCs.

         <title>Induction of Bleb Structures in Lipid Nanoparticle Formulations of mRNA Leads to Improved Transfection Potency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) mRNA systems composed of optimized ionizable lipids often display distinctive mRNA&#8208;rich &#8220;bleb&#8221; structures. In this work, it is shown that such structures can also be induced for LNPs&#160;containing nominally less active ionizable lipids by formulating them in the presence of high concentrations of pH 4 buffer, leading to dramatically improved transfection potencies both in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
The transfection potency of lipid nanoparticle (LNP) mRNA systems is critically dependent on the ionizable cationic lipid component. LNP mRNA systems composed of optimized ionizable lipids often display distinctive mRNA&#8208;rich &#8220;bleb&#8221; structures. Here, it is shown that such structures can also be induced for LNPs containing nominally less active ionizable lipids by formulating them in the presence of high concentrations of pH 4 buffers such as sodium citrate, leading to improved transfection potencies both in vitro and in vivo. Induction of bleb structure and improved potency is dependent on the type of pH 4 buffer employed, with LNP mRNA systems prepared using 300 mm sodium citrate buffer displaying maximum transfection. The improved transfection potencies of LNP mRNA systems displaying bleb structure can be attributed, at least in part, to enhanced integrity of the encapsulated mRNA. It is concluded that enhanced transfection can be achieved by optimizing formulation parameters to improve mRNA stability and that optimization of ionizable lipids to achieve enhanced potency may well lead to improvements in mRNA integrity through formation of the bleb structure rather than enhanced intracellular delivery.

         <title>Epitaxy of a Monocrystalline CsPbBr3&#8211;SrTiO3 Halide&#8211;Oxide Perovskite p&#8211;n Heterojunction with High Stability for Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite heterojunctions are essential components of perovskite optoelectronics, but their construction and investigation have been impeded by the instability and severe anion interdiffusion of perovskites. A stable p&#8211;n heterojunction is formed with the epitaxy of p&#8208;type CsPbBr3 on n&#8208;type SrTiO3 (STO). The combination of vapor&#8208;phase&#8208;deposited monocrystalline CsPbBr3 and STO makes full use of the unique optoelectrical properties of halide perovskite and excellent stability of oxide perovskite, opening up a new method for the construction of perovskite heterojunction&#8211;based optoelectronics.








Abstract
Perovskite heterojunctions are essential components of perovskite optoelectronics, but their construction and investigation have been impeded by the instability and severe anion interdiffusion. This work epitaxially deposits p&#8208;type CsPbBr3 on n&#8208;type Nb:SrTiO3 (STO) to construct a functional perovskite heterojunction with high stability. The lattice match allows epitaxial growth of CsPbBr3 to occur over large scale, resulting in a monocrystalline thin film with excellent crystallinity and uniformity. The highly stable STO prevents the anion migration frequently happening in halide perovskites, forming a sharp interface of two perovskite with opposite conduction type, with which a diode is fabricated and a current rectification ratio of 374 is obtained. The diode is able to work as a photodetector with dark current of 2.01 &#215; 10&#8722;12 A at &#8722;1&#160;V and responsivity (R) of 8.26 A W&#8722;1, rendering a detectivity (D*) of 2.98 &#215; 1013 Jones. Owing to the all&#8208;inorganic architecture, effective photoresponse at temperature as high as 150 &#176;C is guaranteed with D* of &#8776;1.52 &#215; 1013 Jones. Combining the unique optoelectrical properties of halide perovskite and the rigidity of oxide perovskite, the epitaxy of CsPbBr3 on n&#8211;type STO opens up a new method to construct functional perovskite heterojunction for optoelectronics.

&lt;p&gt;Perovskite heterojunctions are essential components of perovskite optoelectronics, but their construction and investigation have been impeded by the instability and severe anion interdiffusion of perovskites. A stable p&#8211;n heterojunction is formed with the epitaxy of p-type CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; on n-type SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (STO). The combination of vapor-phase-deposited monocrystalline CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and STO makes full use of the unique optoelectrical properties of halide perovskite and excellent stability of oxide perovskite, opening up a new method for the construction of perovskite heterojunction&#8211;based optoelectronics.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perovskite heterojunctions are essential components of perovskite optoelectronics, but their construction and investigation have been impeded by the instability and severe anion interdiffusion. This work epitaxially deposits p-type CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; on n-type Nb:SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (STO) to construct a functional perovskite heterojunction with high stability. The lattice match allows epitaxial growth of CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to occur over large scale, resulting in a monocrystalline thin film with excellent crystallinity and uniformity. The highly stable STO prevents the anion migration frequently happening in halide perovskites, forming a sharp interface of two perovskite with opposite conduction type, with which a diode is fabricated and a current rectification ratio of 374 is obtained. The diode is able to work as a photodetector with dark current of 2.01 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;12&lt;/sup&gt; A at &#8722;1&#160;V and responsivity (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;) of 8.26 A W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, rendering a detectivity (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;*) of 2.98 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Jones. Owing to the all-inorganic architecture, effective photoresponse at temperature as high as 150 &#176;C is guaranteed with &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;* of &#8776;1.52 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Jones. Combining the unique optoelectrical properties of halide perovskite and the rigidity of oxide perovskite, the epitaxy of CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; on n&#8211;type STO opens up a new method to construct functional perovskite heterojunction for optoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailored Cysteine&#8208;Derived Molecular Structures toward Efficient and Stable Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

A brand&#8208;new passivator, Boc&#8208;S&#8208;4&#8208;methoxy&#8208;benzyl&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine (BMBC), is demonstrated to post&#8208;treat CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx perovskite films. The synergistic effects of an energetic electron donor group and multiple Lewis&#8208;based functional groups in BMBC are purposefully designed to passivate majority of defects. Benefiting from a hydrophobic tert&#8208;butyl group in BMBC, the protection against water invasion is thus significantly enhanced. This study provides a useful understanding and rational design regarding the influence of the molecular configuration on the passivation efficacy in inorganic perovskite&#8208;type photovoltaics.








Abstract
Surface&#8211;defect&#8208;triggered non&#8208;radiative charge recombination and poor stability have become the main roadblock to continued improvement in inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, the main culprits are identified on the inorganic perovskite surface by first&#8208;principles calculations, and to purposefully design a brand&#8208;new passivator, Boc&#8208;S&#8208;4&#8208;methoxy&#8208;benzyl&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine (BMBC), whose multiple Lewis&#8208;based functional groups (NH&#63743;, S&#63743; and C&#63742;O) to suppress halide vacancies and coordinate with undercoordinated Pb2+ through typical Lewis baseacid reactions. The tailored electron&#8208;donating methoxyl group (CH3O&#8211;) can cause an increased electron density on the benzene ring, which strengthens the interaction with undercoordinated Pb2+ via electrostatic interactions. This BMBC passivation can reduce the surface trap density, enlarge grains, prolong the charge lifetime, and cause a more suitable energy&#8208;level alignment. In addition, the hydrophobic tert&#8208;butyl in butoxycarbonyl (Boc&#8208;) group ensures that BMBC is uniformly covered and prevents harmful aggregation through steric repulsion at the perovskite/hole&#8211;transporting layer (HTL) interface, thus providing a hydrophobic umbrella to resist moisture invasion. Consequently, the combination of the above increases the efficiency of CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx PSC from 18.6% to 21.8%, the highest efficiency for this type of inorganic metal halide PSCs so far, as far as it is known. Moreover, the device exhibits higher environmental and thermal stability.

         <title>BiFeO3 Nanoparticles: The &#8220;Holy&#8208;Grail&#8221; of Piezo&#8208;Photocatalysts?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient and versatile BiFeO3 nanoparticle piezocatalysts are found to exhibit strong piezocatalytic and synergistic piezo&#8208;photocatalytic effects (100% degradation ratio of Rhodamine B within 5&#160;min) and are embedded into a P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) polymer to design a flexible, stable, and reusable multicatalytic system for wastewater treatment using mechanical forces and sunlight.








Abstract
Recently, piezoelectric&#8208;based catalysis has been demonstrated to be an efficient means and promising alternative to sunlight&#8208;driven photocatalysis, where mechanical vibrations trigger redox reactions. Here, 60&#160;nm&#8208;size BiFeO3 nanoparticles are shown to be very effective for piezo&#8208;degrading Rhodamine B (RhB) model dye with record degradation rate reaching 13&#160;810&#160;L&#160;mol&#8722;1&#160;min&#8722;1, and even 41 750&#160;L&#160;mol&#8722;1&#160;min&#8722;1 (i.e., 100% RhB degradation within 5&#160;min) when piezocatalysis is synergistically combined with sunlight photocatalysis. These BiFeO3 piezocatalytic nanoparticles are also demonstrated to be versatile toward several dyes and pharmaceutical pollutants, with over 80% piezo&#8208;decomposition within 120&#160;min. The maintained high piezoelectric coefficient combined with low dielectric constant, high&#8208;elastic modulus, and the nanosized shape make these BiFeO3&#160;nanoparticles extremely efficient piezocatalysts. To avoid subsequent secondary pollution and enable their reusability, the BiFeO3 nanoparticles are further embedded in a polymer P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) matrix. The as&#8208;designed flexible, chemically stable, and recyclable nanocomposites still keep remarkable piezocatalytic and piezo&#8208;photocatalytic performances (i.e., 92% and 100% RhB degradation, respectively, within 20&#160;min). This work opens a new research avenue for BiFeO3 that is the model multiferroic and offers a new platform for water cleaning, as well as other applications such as water splitting, CO2 reduction, or surface purification.

         <title>Biomimetic Multicolor&#8208;Separating Photonic Skin using Electrically Stretchable Chiral Photonic Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multimodulus chiral photonic elastomers (CPEs) are modulated, and multicolor control with dynamic wavelength change from a single color is realized. Multicolor separation by mechanical stretching or electrical stretching occurs via the exploitation of engineered modulus&#8208;adjusted CPEs. Moreover, stretchable multicolor separation using a mixed array of CPEs is investigated for potential photonic camouflage applications.








Abstract
Structural color can be produced by nanoperiodic dielectric structures using soft materials. Chiral photonic elastomers (CPEs) produced from elastic chiral liquid crystal molecules can self&#8208;organize into a helical nanostructure, and the chiral nanostructural color can be tuned by stretching. However, the ability to control the separation of biomimetic multicolors for practical applications beyond simple uniaxial stretching of single&#8208;colored structures has been limited until now. Here, stretchable CPEs with simultaneous multicolor control, including electrical control, are presented. By engineering the heterogeneous elastic modulus of the CPEs, stretchable and simultaneous multicolor separations from an initially homogeneous color are realized. Electrically stretchable multicolor separation is investigated using a hybrid CPE structure on dielectric elastomer actuators, and multiarrayed color binning and chameleon&#8208;like photonic e&#8208;skin are further developed for device applications. Moreover, multicolor concealed camouflage switching and control of invisible photonic e&#8208;skin are demonstrated. This multicolor control of stretchable photonic systems improves the functionality of various potential photonic applications.

MXene
In article number 2300422, Mostafa Dadashi Firouzjaei, Mark Elliott, Babak Ansori, and co&#8208;workers study the life&#8208;cycle assessment of the Ti3C2Tx MXene's synthesis. The cumulative energy demand and overall environmental impacts of synthesis for electromagnetic interface shielding applications are investigated. In addition, the environmental impacts and energy demand of each primary parameter playing a role in the synthesis of MXene are quantified. This study will aid in the industrialization of MXene.

Antiferromagnetic Materials
In article number 2302120, Deepak K. Singh and co&#8208;workers report the discovery of high&#8208;temperature antiferromagnetic properties in NiSi metal via neutron scattering measurements at the CORELLI spectrometer at SNS&#8208;ORNL, which can have strong implications toward spintronics research. The image shows the spin correlation of Ni ions on two non&#8208;equivalent sites, which is inferred from the modeling of elastic neutron data (shown in the background).

Perovskite Solar Cells
In article number 2302143, Ju&#8208;Hyeon Kim, Heejoo Kim, Kwanghee Lee, and co&#8208;workers describe an efficient quasi&#8208;2D&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based solar cell. They improve the photocurrent and stability of the cell through a simple post&#8208;treatment, which induces both defect passivation and crystal reconstruction effects, resulting in efficient charge transport.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Perovskite Solar Cells&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202302143"&gt;2302143&lt;/a&gt;, Ju-Hyeon Kim, Heejoo Kim, Kwanghee Lee, and co-workers describe an efficient quasi-2D-perovskite-based solar cell. They improve the photocurrent and stability of the cell through a simple post-treatment, which induces both defect passivation and crystal reconstruction effects, resulting in efficient charge transport. This approach provides an innovative technique for achieving high-performance quasi-2D-perovskite-based optoelectronic devices.

Multicolor Switching
In article number 2302456, Su Seok Choi and co&#8208;workers investigate biomimetic multicolor separation control of mechanochromic switching using electrically stretchable chiral liquid crystal elastomers (CLCEs). With advanced engineering of electrically stretchable CLCEs, various multicolor switching devices are experimentally verified. A chameleon&#8208;like synthetic multicolor photonic skin control is also reported, with invisibility switching using electrically stretchable CLCEs. The conceived multicolor CLCEs are also validated with camouflage information control using color pixels reconfiguration and invisibility switching.

Tissue Bioprinting
In article number 2302229, Tal Dvir and co&#8208;workers demonstrate a biocompatible method for reinforcing engineered tissue post&#8208;fabrication. The technique enables 3D bioprinting of soft tissue and gives the cells time to establish intercellular communications before the tissue's mechanical properties are significantly improved by the reinforcement protocol. In the work, thick, vascularized cardiac tissues are enhanced to the point of injectability.

         <title>Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells by Tailoring of Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stability of perovskite solar cells is a significant challenge for commercialization due to the inherent instability of the perovskite material and the interface defects between different layers in the device. Tailoring the interfaces in perovskite solar cells can enhance the device's efficiency and stability. This review discusses the theory of interface improvement and various interface materials for efficient, stable perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
The interface tailoring is crucial for the efficiency and stability of Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs). The reported interface engineering primarily focuses on the energy level turning and trap state passivation to improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. In this review, molecule modifications are classified according to the basics of electron transfer mechanisms for the interface tailoring of materials. An in&#8208;depth analysis of energy level modification and trap passivation, as well as the universal Density Functional Theory (DFT) method employed in interface tailoring. In addition, strategies to address environmental protection and large&#8208;scale mini&#8208;modules fabrication by interface engineering are also discussed. This review can guide the researchers in understanding interface engineering to design interface materials for efficient, stable, and eco&#8208;friendly PSCs.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are seen as potentially promising candidates for novel light&#8208;emission applications, owing to their unique characteristics. This review summarizes the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress made in the development of 2D TMDC&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting devices and highlights the remaining challenges.








Abstract
2D monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) show great promise for the development of next&#8208;generation light&#8208;emitting devices owing to their unique electronic and optoelectronic properties. The dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free surface and direct&#8208;bandgap structure of monolayer TMDCs allow for near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum efficiencies. The excellent mechanical and optical characteristics of 2D TMDCs offer great potential to fabricate TMDC&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) featuring good flexibility and transparency. Great progress has been made in the fabrication of bright and efficient LEDs with varying device structures. In this review, the aim is to provide a comprehensive summary of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress made in the construction of bright and efficient LEDs based on 2D TMDCs. After a brief introduction to the research background, the preparation of 2D TMDCs used for LEDs is briefly discussed. The requirements and the corresponding challenges to achieve bright and efficient LEDs based on 2D TMDCs are introduced. Thereafter, various strategies to enhance the brightness of monolayer 2D TMDCs are described. Following that, the carrier&#8208;injection schemes enabling bright and efficient TMDC&#8208;based LEDs along with the device performance are summarized. Finally, the challenges and future prospects regarding the accomplishment of TMDC&#8208;LEDs with ultimate brightness and efficiency are discussed.

         <title>Microenvironment Engineering of Single/Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Electrocatalytic Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in the microenvironment engineering of single/dual&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs/DACs) for electrocatalytic applications are systematically reviewed. The microenvironment regulation principles of carbon&#8208;based single/dual&#8208;atom sites, corresponding structure&#8211;performance relationships with reaction mechanism study over several electrochemical processes for SACs and DACs are thoroughly discussed. This review aims to provide an inspiration on the development of atomically dispersed catalysts in electrocatalysis field.








Abstract
Single/dual&#8208;metal atoms supported on carbon matrix can be modulated by coordination structure and neighboring active sites. Precisely designing the geometric and electronic structure and uncovering the structure&#8211;property relationships of single/dual&#8208;metal atoms confront with grand challenges. Herein, this review summarizes the latest progress in microenvironment engineering of single/dual&#8208;atom active sites via a comprehensive comparison of single&#8208;atom catalyst (SACs) and dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) in term of design principles, modulation strategy, and theoretical understanding of structure&#8211;performance correlations. Subsequently, recent advances in several typical electrocatalysis process are discussed to get general understanding of the reaction mechanisms on finely&#8208;tuned SACs and DACs. Finally, full&#8208;scaled summaries of the challenges and prospects are given for microenvironment engineering of SACs and DACs. This review will provide new inspiration on the development of atomically dispersed catalysts for electrocatalytic application.

         <title>Reconfiguring Hard Carbons with Emerging Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries: A Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights three critical structural features of hard carbons for practical use in sodium&#8208;ion batteries, namely crystallites, defects, and nanopores. The impact of these structural features upon sodium storage is systematically discussed and an ideal configuration, namely sieving carbons with tightened pore entrance and enlarged pore body, is finally proposed for superior sodium storage.








Abstract
Hard carbons, an important category of amorphous carbons, are non&#8208;graphitizable and are widely accepted as the most promising anode materials for emerging sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs)&#65292; because of their changeable low&#8208;potential charge/discharge plateaus. However, their microstructures are not fixed and are difficult to accurately demonstrate as graphites do. The successful use of hard carbons in SIBs revives the interest to clearly picture their complicated microstructures that are in close relevance to sodium storage. In this review, the past definitions and structural models of hard carbons are revisited first, and a renewed understanding of their sodium storage is presented. Three critical structural features are highlighted for hard carbons, namely crystallites, defects, and nanopores, which are directly responsible for the presence of the low&#8208;potential plateaus and their reversible extension. The impact of these structural features upon the sodium storage is then deeply discussed and sieving carbons is finally proposed as an ideal configuration of carbon anode for superhigh sodium storage. This review is expected to offer a clear picture of hard carbons, and help realize a truly rational design of high&#8208;capacity carbon anodes, driving the industrialization of SIBs, and more promisingly open up a window for exploring their possible new uses.

A comprehensive review is proposed on the recent advances of sonosensitive nanomaterials in advancing four ultrasound&#8208;related biological applications and disease treatments. In addition to the mostly explored nanomedicine&#8208;enabled/augmented sonodynamic therapy (SDT), the summary and discussion of other sono&#8208;therapies and progresses/achievements are also conducted, including sonomechanical therapy (SMT), sonopiezoelectric therapy (SPT), and sonothermal therapy (STT).








Abstract
Nanomedicine&#8208;enabled/augmented ultrasound (US) medicine is a unique area of interdisciplinary research that focuses on designing and engineering functional nanosystems to address the challenging issues in US&#8208;based biomedicine, overcoming the shortcomings of traditional microbubbles and optimizing the design of contrast and sonosensitive agents. The single&#8208;faceted summary of available US&#8208;related therapies is still a significant drawback. Here, The proposal of a comprehensive review on the recent advances of sonosensitive nanomaterials in advancing four US&#8208;related biological applications and disease theranostics is aimed. In addition to the mostly explored nanomedicine&#8208;enabled/augmented sonodynamic therapy (SDT), the summary and discussion of other sono&#8208;therapies and progresses/achievements are relatively lacking, including sonomechanical therapy (SMT), sonopiezoelectric therapy (SPT), and sonothermal therapy (STT). The design concepts of the specific sono&#8208;therapies based on nanomedicines are initially introduced. Furthermore, the representative paradigms for nanomedicine&#8208;enabled/enhanced US therapies are elaborated according to therapeutic principles and diversity. This review provides an updated and comprehensive review of the field of nanoultrasonic biomedicine, and comprehensively discusses the progress of versatile ultrasonic disease treatments. Finally, the deep discussion on the facing challenges and prospects is expected to promote the emergence and establishment of a new branch of US biomedicine through the rational combination of nanomedicine and US clinical biomedicine.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Deficient Bioceramics: Combination of Diagnosis, Therapy, and Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fourth generation of bioceramics called colored/oxygen&#8208;deficient for biomedical applications are introduced in this review. The importance of this class of bioceramics can be defined through multifunctionality since they are regarded as the connection between the past and future. The microstructure, applications, potential challenges, future trends, and perspectives are discussed in detail.








Abstract
The journey of ceramics in medicine has been synchronized with an evolution from the first generation&#8212;alumina, zirconia, etc.&#8212;to the third &#8212;3D scaffolds. There is an up&#8208;and&#8208;coming member called oxygen&#8208;deficient or colored bioceramics, which have recently found their way through biomedical applications. The oxygen vacancy steers the light absorption toward visible and near infrared regions, making the colored bioceramics multifunctional&#8212;therapeutic, diagnostic, and regenerative. Oxygen&#8208;deficient bioceramics are capable of turning light into heat and reactive oxygen species for photothermal and photodynamic therapies, respectively, and concomitantly yield infrared and photoacoustic images. Different types of oxygen&#8208;deficient bioceramics have been recently developed through various synthesis routes. Some of them like TiO2&#8722;x, MoO3&#8722;x, and WOx have been more investigated for biomedical applications, whereas the rest have yet to be scrutinized. The most prominent advantage of these bioceramics over the other biomaterials is their multifunctionality endowed with a change in the microstructure. There are some challenges ahead of this category discussed at the end of the present review. By shedding light on this recently born bioceramics subcategory, it is believed that the field will undergo a big step further as these platforms are naturally multifunctional.

         <title>The Oxygen Evolution Reaction Drives Passivity Breakdown for Ni&#8211;Cr&#8211;Mo&#160;Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Passivity breakdown of Cr&#8208;containing alloys upon anodic polarization is traditionally believed to be caused by oxidation of stable Cr3+ oxide to soluble Cr6+ species leading to fast metal dissolution. By using multimodal in situ synchrotron measurements of highly alloyed Ni&#8211;base alloys, a new passivity breakdown mechanism is reported, namely oxygen evolution reaction (OER) induced metal dissolution occurring at lower anodic potentials.








Abstract
Corrosion is the main factor limiting the lifetime of metallic materials, and a fundamental understanding of the governing mechanism and surface processes is difficult to achieve since the thin oxide films at the metal&#8211;liquid interface governing passivity are notoriously challenging to study. In this work, a combination of synchrotron&#8208;based techniques and electrochemical methods is used to investigate the passive film breakdown of a Ni&#8211;Cr&#8211;Mo alloy, which is&#160;used in many industrial applications. This alloy is found to be active toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the OER onset coincides with the loss of passivity and severe metal dissolution. The OER mechanism involves the oxidation of Mo4+ sites in the oxide film to Mo6+ that can be dissolved, which results in passivity breakdown. This is fundamentally different from typical transpassive breakdown of Cr&#8208;containing alloys where Cr6+ is postulated to be dissolved at high anodic potentials, which is not observed here. At high current densities, OER also leads to acidification of the solution near the surface, further triggering metal dissolution. The OER plays an important role in the mechanism of passivity breakdown of Ni&#8211;Cr&#8211;Mo alloys due to their catalytic activity, and this effect needs to be considered when studying the corrosion of catalytically active alloys.

         <title>An Ultra&#8208;thin MXene Film for Multimodal Sensing of Neuroelectrical Signals with Artifacts Removal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Neuroelectrical signals transmitted onto the skin tend to decay to an extremely weak level, making them highly susceptible to interference from the environment and body movement. Meanwhile, for comprehensively understanding cognitive nerve conduction, multimodal sensing of neural signals, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional near&#8208;infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), is highly required. Previous metal or polymer conductors cannot either provide a seamless on&#8208;skin feature for accurate sensing of neuroelectrical signals or be compatible with multimodal imaging techniques without opto&#8208; and magnet&#8208; artifacts. Herein, we report a &#8764; 20&#160;nm thick MXene film that is able to simultaneously detect electrophysiological signals and perform imaging by MRI and fNIRS with high fidelity. The ultrathin film is made of crosslinked Ti3C2Tx film via poly (3,4&#8208;ethylene dioxythiophene): polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), showing a record high electroconductivity and transparency combination (11000&#8201;S/cm @89%). Among them, PEDOT:PSS not only plays a cross&#8208;linking role to stabilize MXene film but also shortens the interlayer distance for effective charge transfer and high transparency. Thus, it can achieve a low interfacial impedance with skin or neural surfaces for accurate recording of electrophysiological signals with low motion artifacts. Besides, the high transparency originating from the ultrathin feature leads to good compatibility with fNIRS and MRI without optical and magnetic artifacts, enabling multimodal cognitive neural monitoring during prolonged use.

Previous metal or polymer conductors cannot either provide a seamless on-skin feature for accurate sensing of neuroelectrical signals or be compatible with multimodal imaging techniques without opto- and magnet- artifacts. Herein, we report a &#8764; 20&#160;nm thick MXene film that is able to simultaneously detect electrophysiological signals and perform imaging by MRI and fNIRS with high fidelity. The ultrathin film is made of crosslinked Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; film via poly (3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene): polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), showing a record high electroconductivity and transparency combination (11000&#8201;S/cm @89%). Among them, PEDOT:PSS not only plays a cross-linking role to stabilize MXene film but also shortens the interlayer distance for effective charge transfer and high transparency. Thus, it can achieve a low interfacial impedance with skin or neural surfaces for accurate recording of electrophysiological signals with low motion artifacts. Besides, the high transparency originating from the ultrathin feature leads to good compatibility with fNIRS and MRI without optical and magnetic artifacts, enabling multimodal cognitive neural monitoring during prolonged use.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Carbon Nanotube&#8208;Directed 7&#8208;GPa Heterocyclic Aramid Fiber And Its Application in Artificial Muscles</title>

Abstract
Poly(p&#8208;phenylene&#8208;benzimidazole&#8208;terephthalamide) (PBIA) fibers with excellent mechanical properties are widely used in fields that require impact&#8208;resistant materials such as ballistic protection and aerospace. The introduction of heterocycles in polymer chains increases their flexibility and makes it easier to optimize the fiber structure during spinning. However, the inadequate orientation of polymer chains is one of the main reasons for the large difference between the measured and theoretical mechanical properties of PBIA fibers. Herein, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are selected as an orientation seed. Their structural features allow CNTs to orient during the spinning process, which can induce an orderly arrangement of polymers and improve the orientation of the fiber microstructure, including in the crystalline and amorphous regions. To ensure the complete one&#8208;dimensional topology of long CNTs (&#8764;10&#160;&#956;m), PBIA is used as an efficient dispersant to overcome dispersion challenges. The p&#8208;CNT/PBIA fibers (10&#160;&#956;m&#8208;SWNT 0.025 wt%) exhibit an increase of 22% in tensile strength and 23% in elongation, with a maximum tensile strength of 7.01&#177;0.31&#160;GPa and a reinforcement efficiency of 893.6. The artificial muscle fabricated using CNT/PBIA fibers exhibits a 34.8% contraction and a 25% lifting of a 2&#160;kg dumbbell, providing a promising paradigm for high&#8208;performance organic fibers as high&#8208;load smart actuators.

         <title>Modulation of Radical Intermediates in Rechargeable Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic materials have been considered as promising electrodes for next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries in view of their sustainability, structural flexibility, and potential recyclability. The radical intermediates generated during the redox process of organic electrodes have profound effect on the reversible capacity, operation voltage, rate performance, and cycling stability. However, the radicals are highly reactive and have very short lifetime during the redox of organic materials. Great efforts have been devoted to capturing and investigating the radical intermediates in organic electrodes. Herein, this review summarizes the importance, history, structures, and working principles of organic radicals in rechargeable batteries. More importantly, challenges and strategies to track and regulate the radicals in organic batteries are highlighted. Finally, further perspectives of organic radicals are proposed for the development of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance rechargeable organic batteries.

         <title>Flexible Carbon Nanotube&#8208;Epitaxially Grown Nanocrystals for Micro&#8208;Thermoelectric Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Flexible thermoelectric materials have attracted increasing interest because of their potential use in thermal energy harvesting and high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution thermal management. However, a high&#8208;performance flexible micro&#8208;thermoelectric device (TED) compatible with the microelectronics fabrication process has not yet been developed. Here we report a universal epitaxial growth strategy guided by one&#8208;dimensional van der Waals&#8208;coupling, to fabricate freestanding and flexible hybrids comprised of single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes and ordered (Bi,Sb)2Te3 nanocrystals. High power factors ranging from &#8764;1680 to &#8764;1020 &#956;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 in the temperature range of 300 K to 480 K, combined with a low thermal conductivity yield a high average figure of merit of &#8764;0.81. The fabricated flexible micro&#8208;TED module consisting of two p&#8208;n couples of freestanding thermoelectric hybrids has an unprecedented open circuit voltage of &#8764;22.7 mV and a power density of &#8764;0.36 W cm&#8722;2 under a &#8764;30 K temperature difference, and a net cooling temperature of &#8764;22.4 K and a heat absorption density of &#8764;92.5 W cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Based Therapies for Inflammatory Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive overview of inflammatory therapy based on transition metal&#8208;based smart nanosystems from the aspects of rationale design strategies (types, nanozyme activity regulation, physical and chemical characteristics) and therapeutic mechanisms (scavenge, block, and delivery&#8208;based strategy) is provided in this review with an emphasis on the current challenges and prospects in this field.








Abstract
Inflammatory disease (ID) is a general term that covers all diseases in which chronic inflammation performs as the major manifestation of pathogenesis. Traditional therapies based on the anti&#8208;inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs are palliative with the short&#8208;term remission. The emergence of nanodrugs has been reported to solve the potential causes and prevent recurrences, thus holding great potential for the treatment of IDs. Among various nanomaterial systems, transition metal&#8208;based smart nanosystems (TMSNs) with unique electronic structures possess therapeutic advantages owing to their large surface area to volume ratio, high photothermal conversion efficiency, X&#8208;ray absorption capacity, and multiple catalytic enzyme activities. In this review, the rationale, design principle, and therapeutic mechanisms of TMSNs for treatments of various IDs are summarized. Specifically, TMSNs can not only be designed to scavenge danger signals, such as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and cell&#8208;free DNA, but also can be engineered to block the mechanism of initiating inflammatory responses. In addition, TMSNs can be further applied as nanocarriers to deliver anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs. Finally, the opportunities and challenges of TMSNs are discussed, and the future directions of TMSN&#8208;based ID treatment for clinical applications are emphasized.

         <title>Patterning Quantum Dots via Photolithography: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum dots (QDs) are used as promising materials for next&#8208;generation displays due to their excellent electrical/optical properties. Strategies for patterning QDs via photolithography (conventional photolithography, lift off process, and direct photolithography) are comprehensively reviewed. This review also discusses the prospects for patterned QDs in terms of their structural and physical properties.








Abstract
Pixelating patterns of red, green, and blue quantum dots (QDs) is a critical challenge for realizing high&#8208;end displays with bright and vivid images for virtual, augmented, and mixed reality. Since QDs must be processed from a solution, their patterning process is completely different from the conventional techniques used in the organic light&#8208;emitting diode and liquid crystal display industries. Although innovative QD patterning technologies are being developed, photopatterning based on the light&#8208;induced chemical conversion of QD films is considered one of the most promising methods for forming micrometer&#8208;scale QD patterns that satisfy the precision and fidelity required for commercialization. Moreover, the practical impact will be significant as it directly exploits mature photolithography technologies and facilities that are widely available in the semiconductor industry. This article reviews recent progress in the effort to form QD patterns via photolithography. The review begins with a general description of the photolithography process. Subsequently, different types of photolithographical methods applicable to QD patterning are introduced, followed by recent achievements using these methods in forming high&#8208;resolution QD patterns. The paper also discusses prospects for future research directions.

Fatigue&#8208;resistant conducting hydrogel coating for long&#8208;term biointerfacing: Fatigue&#8208;resistant conducting polymer hydrogel coating on conventional metallic bioelectrodes is fabricated through the engineering of nanocrystalline domains at the interface, enabling long&#8208;term electrocardiogram recording and electrical pacing without failure.








Abstract
Because of their distinct electrochemical and mechanical properties, conducting polymer hydrogels have been widely exploited as soft, wet, and conducting coatings for conventional metallic electrodes, providing mechanically compliant interfaces and mitigating foreign body responses. However, the long&#8208;term viability of these hydrogel coatings is hindered by concerns regarding fatigue crack propagation and/or delamination caused by repetitive volumetric expansion/shrinkage during long&#8208;term electrical interfacing. This study reports a general yet reliable approach to achieving a fatigue&#8208;resistant conducting polymer hydrogel coating on conventional metallic bioelectrodes by engineering nanocrystalline domains at the interface between the hydrogel and metallic substrates. It demonstrates the efficacy of this robust, biocompatible, and fatigue&#8208;resistant conducting hydrogel coating in cardiac pacing, showcasing its ability to effectively reduce the pacing threshold voltage and enhance the long&#8208;term reliability of electric stimulation. This study findings highlight the potential of its approach as a promising design and fabrication strategy for the next generation of seamless bioelectronic&#160;interfaces.

         <title>Spiral&#8208;structured Dielectric Polymers Exhibiting Ultra&#8208;High Energy Density And Charge&#8208;Discharge Efficiency at High Temperatures</title>

Abstract
The growing need for high&#8208;power and compact&#8208;size energy storage in modern electronic and electrical systems demands polymer film capacitors with excellent temperature capability. However, conventional polymer dielectrics feature dramatic deterioration in capacitive performance under concurrent high temperature and electric field, because the high thermal stability traditionally relies on the conjugated, planar molecular segments in the polymer chains. Herein, inspired by the stable double helix structures of deoxyribonucleic acid, we demonstrate spiral&#8208;structured dielectric polymers that exhibit simultaneous high thermal stability and great capacitive performance. Both the experimental results and computational simulations confirm that the spiral groups serve to weaken the electrostatic molecular interaction, induce proper molecular chain stacking structure, and regulate the charge transfer process by breaking the conjugated planes and introducing deep trap sites. The resultant polymer exhibits the maximum discharged energy densities of 7.29 and 6.13 J/cm3 with the charge&#8208;discharge efficiency above 90% at 150 and 200&#160;&#176;C, respectively, more than 10 times those of the original dielectric at the same conditions. The present work offers a completely new dimension for the molecular design of polymers, giving rise to well&#8208;balanced thermal and dielectric properties, and ultimately the desired capacitive energy storage performance at high temperatures.

         <title>AIEgen&#8208;based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Preventing Malignant Ventricular Arrhythmias Via Local Hyperthermia Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
We report the engineering of aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgen) based covalent organic frameworks (COFs), TDTA&#8208;COF, BTDTA&#8208;COF, and BTDBETA&#8208;COF, as hyperthermia agents for inhibiting the occurrence of malignant ventricular arrhythmias (VAs). These AIE COFs exhibit dual functionality, as they not only directly modulate the function and neural activity of stellate ganglion (SG) through local hyperthermia therapy (LHT) but also induce the browning of white fat and improve the neuro&#8208;inflammation peri&#8208;SG microenvironment, which is favorable for inhibiting ischemia&#8208;induced VAs. In vivo studies have confirmed that BTDBETA&#8208;COF&#8208;mediated LHT enhances thermogenesis and browning&#8208;related gene expression, thereby serving a synergistic role in combating VAs. Transcriptome analysis of peri&#8208;SG adipose tissue reveals a substantial downregulation of inflammatory cytokines, highlighting the potency of BTDBETA&#8208;COF&#8208;mediated LHT in ameliorating the neuro&#8208;inflammation peri&#8208;SG microenvironment and offering myocardial and arrhythmia protection. Our work on AIE COF&#8208;based hyperthermia agent for VAs inhibition providing a new avenue for mitigating cardiac sympathetic nerve hyperactivity.

Abstract
Antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs) have exciting possibilities in targeted tumor therapy. However, in the existing ADC preparation processes, the random attachment of the payloads to the antigen&#8208;binding fragments (Fab) greatly increases the risk of disrupting its antigen recognition ability, while the DAR is low, leading to a cumbersome preparation process and low drug delivery efficiency. Herein, we used poly(glutamic acid) to expand the number of drug binding sites, based on the &#8220;click chemistry&#8221; of azide and DBCO, and the high affinity of Fc&#8208;III&#8208;4C peptide to the crystalline fragment (Fc) of the monoclonal antibodies. We obtained various antibody&#8208;polymer&#8208;drug conjugates (APDCs) with ultra&#8208;high DAR using this organic&#8208;solvent&#8208;free &#8220;Lego&#8208;like&#8221; modular construction. Among them, aHER2&#8208;P&#8208;MMAE with DAR of 41.6 achieved tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of 99.7% for both medium&#8208;sized and large SKOV&#8208;3 ovarian tumors, and aPDL1&#8208;P&#8208;MMAE (DAR = 40.7) achieved TGI of 98.5% for MC38 colon tumors. In summary, we created a universal platform to prepare Fab&#8208;nondestructive ADCs with ultra&#8208;high DAR, which can be used to develop precision medicine for personalized anti&#8208;cancer therapy.

         <title>Flexible Optoelectronic Multimodal Proximity/Pressure/Temperature Sensors with Low Signal Interference</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Multimodal tactile sensors are a crucial part of intelligent human&#8208;machine interaction and collaboration. Simultaneous detection of proximity, pressure, and temperature on a single sensor can greatly promote the safety, interactivity and compactness of interaction systems. However, severe signal interference and complex decoupling algorithm hinder the actual applications. Here, we report a flexible optoelectronic multimodal sensor capable of detecting and decoupling proximity/pressure/temperature by integrating a light waveguide and an interdigital electrode into a compact fibrous sensor. Negligible signal interference is realized by combining heterogeneous sensing mechanisms of optics and electronics, which encodes proximity into capacitance, pressure into light intensity and temperature into resistance. The sensor exhibited a large sensing distance of 225 mm with fast responses for proximity detection, a pressure sensitivity of 0.42 N&#8722;1, and a temperature sensitivity of 7%/&#176;C. As a proof of concept, the doll equipped with the sensor can accurately discriminate and detect various stimuli, thus achieving safe and immersive interactions with the user. This work opens up promising paths for self&#8208;decoupled multimodal sensors and related human/machine/environment interaction applications.

         <title>Digital Manufacturing of Functional Ready&#8208;to&#8208;Use Microfluidic Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Digital manufacturing (DM) strives for the seamless manufacture of a functional device from a digital file. DM holds great potential for microfluidics, but requirements for embedded conduits and high resolution beyond the capability of common manufacturing equipment, and microfluidic systems&#8217; dependence on peripherals (e.g., connections, power supply, computer), have limited its adoption. Microfluidic capillaric circuits (CCs) are structurally&#8208;encoded, self&#8208;contained microfluidic systems that operate and self&#8208;fill thanks to precisely tailored hydrophilicity. CCs were heretofore hydrophilized in a plasma chamber, but which only produces transient hydrophilicity, lacks reproducibility, and limits CC design to open surface channels sealed with a tape. Here we introduce the additive DM of monolithic, fully functional and intrinsically hydrophilic CCs. CCs were 3D printed with commonly available light engine&#8208;based 3D printers using polyethylene(glycol)diacrylate&#8208;based ink co&#8208;polymerized with hydrophilic acrylic acid crosslinkers and optimized for hydrophilicity and printability. A new, robust capillary valve design and embedded conduits with circular cross&#8208;sections that prevent bubble trapping are presented, and complex interwoven circuit architectures created, and their use illustrated with an immunoassay. Finally, the need for external paper capillary pumps is eliminated by directly embedding the capillary pump in the chip as a porous gyroid structure, realizing fully functional, monolithic CCs. Thence, a computer&#8208;aided design file can be made into a CC by commonly available 3D printers in less than 30&#160;min enabling low&#8208;cost, distributed, DM of fully functional ready&#8208;to&#8208;use microfluidic systems.

A new, robust capillary valve design and embedded conduits with circular cross-sections that prevent bubble trapping are presented, and complex interwoven circuit architectures created, and their use illustrated with an immunoassay. Finally, the need for external paper capillary pumps is eliminated by directly embedding the capillary pump in the chip as a porous gyroid structure, realizing fully functional, monolithic CCs. Thence, a computer-aided design file can be made into a CC by commonly available 3D printers in less than 30&#160;min enabling low-cost, distributed, DM of fully functional ready-to-use microfluidic systems.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Pulsed Laser&#8208;triggered Piezoelectric Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction Over Tetragonal BaTiO3 Nanocubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The recombination of photo&#8208;induced carriers in photocatalysts has been considered as one of the most barriers for the increase of photocatalysis efficiency. Piezoelectric photocatalyst opens a new route to realize rapid carrier separation by mechanically distorting lattice of piezoelectric nanocrystals to form a piezoelectric potential within the nanocrystals, generally requaring external force (e.g., the ultrasonic radiation, mechanical stirring and ball milling). In this study, the low power ultraviolet (UV) pulsed laser (PL, 3&#160;W, 355&#160;nm) as UV light source can trigger piezoelectric photocatalytic CO2 reduction of tetragonal BaTiO3 (BTO&#8208;T) in the absence of applied force. The transient tremendous light pressure (5.7&#215;107&#160;Pa, 2.7&#160;W) of 355&#160;nm PL not only bends the energy band of BTO&#8208;T, thus allowing reactions that cannot theoretically occur to take place, but also induce a pulsed build&#8208;in electric field to determine an efficient photoinduced carrier separation. On that basis, the PL triggered piezoelectric photocatalytic CO2 reduction realizes the reported highest performance, reaching the millimole level CO yield of 52.9&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, and achieving efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction in the continuous catalytic system. The method in this study is promising to contribute to the design of efficient piezoelectric photocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Patterning Complex Line Motifs in Thin Films Using Immersion&#8208;Controlled Reaction&#8208;Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, reaction&#8208;diffusion driven immersion&#8208;controlled patterning (R&#8208;DIP) is introduced. By tying reaction&#8208;diffusion processes to immersion, wafer&#8208;scale line motifs are created. In R&#8208;DIP, a balance between diffusion and immersion speed provides robustness toward defects and highly uniform line spacing. The functionality potential of R&#8208;DIP is demonstrated by manufacturing tunable optical diffraction gratings and an opto&#8208;mechanical sensor.








Abstract
The discovery of self&#8208;organization principles that enable scalable routes toward complex functional materials has proven to be a persistent challenge. Here, reaction&#8208;diffusion driven, immersion&#8208;controlled patterning (R&#8208;DIP) is introduced, a self&#8208;organization strategy using immersion&#8208;controlled reaction&#8208;diffusion for targeted line patterning in thin films. By modulating immersion speeds, the movement of a reaction&#8208;diffusion front over gel films is controlled, which induces precipitation of highly uniform lines at the reaction front. A balance between the immersion speed and diffusion provides both hands&#8208;on tunability of the line spacing (d=10&#8722;300&#956;m$d = 10-300 \; \umu \text{m}$) as well as error&#8208;correction against defects. This immersion&#8208;driven patterning strategy is widely applicable, which is demonstrated by producing line patterns of silver/silver oxide nanoparticles, silver chromate, silver dichromate, and lead carbonate. Through combinatorial stacking of different line patterns, hybrid materials with multi&#8208;dimensional patterns such as square&#8208;, diamond&#8208;, rectangle&#8208;, and triangle&#8208;shaped motifs are fabricated. The functionality potential and scalability is demonstrated by producing both wafer&#8208;scale diffraction gratings with user&#8208;defined features as well as an opto&#8208;mechanical sensor based on Moir&#233;&#160;patterning.

         <title>Emerging Iontronic Neural Devices for Neuromorphic Sensory Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iontronic device based on ion motion control is a promising platform to simulate the sensing and computing functions of organisms because of their biological relevance during device operation. This review provides a comprehensive overview of emerging neuromorphic sensory computing by iontronic devices, highlighting representative concepts of both low&#8208;level and high&#8208;level sensory computing and introducing important material and device breakthroughs.








Abstract
Living organisms have a very mysterious and powerful sensory computing system based on ion activity. Interestingly, studies&#160;on iontronic devices in the past few years have proposed a promising platform for simulating the sensing and computing functions of living organisms, because: 1) iontronic devices can generate, store, and transmit a variety of signals by adjusting the concentration and spatiotemporal distribution of ions, which analogs to how the brain performs intelligent functions by alternating ion flux and polarization; 2) through ionic&#8208;electronic coupling, iontronic devices can bridge the biosystem with electronics and offer profound implications for soft electronics; 3) with the diversity of ions, iontronic devices can be designed to recognize specific ions or molecules by customizing the charge selectivity, and the ionic conductivity and capacitance can be adjusted to respond to external stimuli for a variety of sensing schemes, which can be more difficult for electron&#8208;based devices. This review provides a comprehensive overview of emerging neuromorphic sensory computing by iontronic devices, highlighting representative concepts of both low&#8208;level and high&#8208;level sensory computing and introducing important material and device breakthroughs. Moreover, iontronic devices as a means of neuromorphic sensing and computing are discussed regarding the pending challenges and future directions.

         <title>Realization and Control of Bulk and Surface Modes in 3D Nanomagnonic Networks by Additive Manufacturing of Ferromagnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D ferromagnetic nanodevices are expected to provide enhanced functionality for data storage, magnonics, and spintronics. An additive manufacturing methodology for ferromagnetic Ni is reported by which different networks of 3D interconnected nanotubes are produced. The structures show engineered magnon modes at surprisingly high GHz frequencies and a clear discrepancy between bulk and surface states, opening new perspectives in magnonics.








Abstract
The high&#8208;density integration in information technology fuels the research on functional 3D nanodevices. Particularly ferromagnets promise multifunctional 3D devices for nonvolatile data storage, high&#8208;speed data processing, and non&#8208;charge&#8208;based logic operations via spintronics and magnonics concepts. However, 3D nanofabrication of ferromagnets is extremely challenging. In this work, an additive manufacturing methodology is reported, and unprecedented 3D ferromagnetic nanonetworks with a woodpile&#8208;structure unit cell are fabricated. The collective spin dynamics (magnons) at frequencies up to 25 GHz are investigated by Brillouin Light Scattering (BLS) microscopy and micromagnetic simulations. A clear discrepancy of about 10 GHz is found between the bulk and surface modes, which are engineered by different unit cell sizes in the Ni&#8208;based nanonetworks. The angle&#8208; and spatially&#8208;dependent modes demonstrate opportunities for multi&#8208;frequency signal processing in 3D circuits via magnons. The developed synthesis route will allow one to create 3D magnonic crystals with chiral unit cells, which are a prerequisite toward surface modes with topologically protected&#160;properties.

         <title>Rising of Dynamic Polyimide Materials: A Versatile Dielectric for Electrical and Electronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How to realize the recycling of polyimide materials has been increasingly recognized as a critical point to develop sustainable society. Damage forms of polyimide, current strategies and methods for mechanical damage, and conceptual design for electrical damage are reviewed. The challenges and opportunities in dynamic polyimides for the reasonably designing molecular structure are proposed.








Abstract
Polyimides (PIs) are widely used in circuit components, electrical insulators, and power systems in modern electronic devices and large electrical appliances. Electrical/mechanical damage of materials are important factors that threaten reliability and service lifetime. Dynamic (self&#8208;healable, recyclable and degradable) PIs, a promising class of materials that successfully improve electrical/mechanical properties after damage, are anticipated to solve this issue. The viewpoints and perspectives on the status and future trends of dynamic PI based on a few existing documents are shared. The main damage forms of PI dielectric materials in the application process are first introduced, and initial strategies and schemes to solve these problems are proposed. Fundamentally, the bottleneck issues faced by the development of dynamic PIs are indicated, and the relationship between various damage forms and the universality of the method is evaluated. The potential mechanism of the dynamic PI to deal with electrical damage is highlighted and several feasible prospective schemes to address electrical damage are discussed. This study is concluded by presenting a short outlook and future improvements to systems, challenges, and solutions of dynamic PI in electrical insulation. The summary of theory and practice should encourage policy development favoring energy conservation and environmental protection and promoting sustainability.

         <title>Colossal Optical Anisotropy from Atomic&#8208;Scale Modulations</title>

Abstract
In modern optics, materials with large birefringence (&#916;n, where n is the refractive index) are sought after for polarization control (e.g., in wave plates, polarizing beam splitters, etc.[3]), nonlinear optics and quantum optics (e.g., for phase matching[5] and production of entangled photons[6]), micromanipulation,[7] and as a platform for unconventional light&#8208;matter coupling, such as Dyakonov&#8208;like surface polaritons[8] and hyperbolic phonon polaritons.[11] Layered &#8220;van der Waals&#8221; materials, with strong intra&#8208;layer bonding and weak inter&#8208;layer bonding, can feature some of the largest optical anisotropy[16]; however, their use in most optical systems is limited because their optic axis is out of the plane of the layers and the layers are weakly attached, making the anisotropy hard to access. Here, we demonstrate that a bulk crystal with subtle periodic modulations in its structure &#8212; Sr9/8TiS3 &#8212; is transparent and positive&#8208;uniaxial, with extraordinary index ne = &#8197;4.5 and ordinary index no = &#8197;2.4 in the mid&#8208; to far&#8208;infrared. The excess Sr, compared to stoichiometric SrTiS3, results in the formation of TiS6 trigonal&#8208;prismatic units that break the infinite chains of face&#8208;shared TiS6 octahedra in SrTiS3 into periodic blocks of five TiS6 octahedral units. The additional electrons introduced by the excess Sr subsequently occupy the TiS6 octahedral blocks to form highly oriented and polarizable electron clouds, which selectively boost the extraordinary index ne and result in record birefringence (&#916;n &gt; 2.1 with low loss). The connection between subtle structural modulations and large changes in refractive index suggests new categories of anisotropic materials and also tunable optical materials with large refractive&#8208;index modulation and low optical losses.

         <title>Engineering the Intrinsic Chirality of Plasmonic Au@Pd Metamaterials for Highly Sensitive Chiroplasmonic Hydrogen Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Metal helicoid nanoparticles with intrinsic three&#8208;dimensional (3D) chiral structures have emerged as a new class of plasmonic metamaterials with outstanding chiroplasmonic properties. Despite the considerable potential of metal helicoid nanoparticles in chiroplasmonic sensing, their sensing capabilities remain elusive, stressing the need for the rational chirality engineering of helicoid nanoparticles. In this report, Au@Pd helicoid nanoparticles with engineered chiroplasmonic properties and integrated hydrogen sensing capabilities are rationally synthesized. As chiroplasmonic metamaterials, the Au@Pd helicoid nanoparticles exhibit unprecedented sensitivity for hydrogen chiroplasmonic sensing in the visible range. A significant circular dichroism red&#8208;shift as large as 206.1&#160;nm can be achieved when they are exposed to hydrogen. Such a high sensitivity outperforms all the plasmonic hydrogen sensors in the visible range. Besides sensitivity, the chiroplasmonic sensing platform shows a good linear range of 1.5&#8208;6.0% hydrogen concentration with higher figure of merit, excellent selectivity, and good reusability. To further demonstrate its applicability, this chiroplasmonic hydrogen sensing platform is utilized to investigate hydrogen absorption and desorption kinetics on Pd. This study heralds a new paradigm for plasmonic hydrogen sensing and highlights the tremendous potential of utilizing helicoid nanoparticles as chiroplasmonic sensing metamaterials by chirality engineering.

         <title>Soft&#8208;Rigid Heterostructures with Functional Cation Vacancies for Fast&#8208;Charging And High&#8208;Capacity Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Optimizing charge transfer and alleviating volume expansion in electrode materials are critical to maximize electrochemical performance for energy storage systems. Herein, an atomically thin soft&#8208;rigid Co9S8@MoS2 core&#8208;shell heterostructure with dual cation vacancies at the atomic interface is constructed as a promising anode for high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The dual cation vacancies involving VCo and VMo in the heterostructure and the soft MoS2 shell afford ionic pathways for rapid charge transfer, as well as the rigid Co9S8 core acts as the dominant active component and resists structural deformation during charge/discharge. Electrochemical testing and theoretical calculations demonstrate both excellent Na+ transfer kinetics and pseudocapacitive behavior. Consequently, the soft&#8208;rigid heterostructure delivers extraordinary sodium storage performance (389.7&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles at 5.0 A g&#8722;1), superior to those of the single&#8208;phase counterparts; and the assembled Na3V2(PO4)3||d&#8208;Co9S8@MoS2/S&#8208;Gr full cell achieves an energy density of 235.5&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 0.5 C. Our finding opens up a new strategy of soft&#8208;rigid heterostructure and broadens the horizons of material design in energy storage and conversion.

         <title>Reshaping Zinc Plating/Stripping Behavior by Interfacial Water Bonding for High&#8208;Utilization&#8208;Rate Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Aqueous zinc batteries have emerged as promising energy storage devices; however, severe parasitic reactions lead to the exacerbated production of Zn dendrites that decrease the utilization rate of Zn anodes. Decreasing the electrolyte content and regulating the water activity are efficient means to address these issues. Herein, we show that limiting the aqueous electrolyte and bonding water to bacterial cellulose (BC) can suppress side reactions and regulate stable Zn plating/stripping. This approach makes it possible to use less electrolyte and limited Zn foil. A symmetric Zn cell assembled with the hydrogel electrolyte with limited electrolyte (electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;capacity ratio E/C = 1.0 g (Ah)&#8722;1) cycled stably at a current density of 6.5 mA cm&#8722;2 and achieved a capacity of 6.5 mA h cm&#8722;2 and depth of discharge of 85%. Full cells with the BC hydrogel electrolyte delivered a discharge capacity of 212 mA h cm&#8722;2 and showed a capacity retention of 83% after 1000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1. This work offers new fundamental insights into the effect of restricting water to reshape the Zn plating/stripping process and provides a route for designing novel hydrogel electrolytes to better stabilize and efficiently utilize the Zn anodes.

         <title>Sorption&#8208;Induced Fiber Optic Plasmonic Gas Sensing via Small Grazing Angle of Incidence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method to fabricate a new class of plasmon&#8208;based nanoparticle&#8208;polymer composite films that realizes a distinct sorption&#8208;induced high&#8208;sensitive plasmonic gas sensing on the fiber optic sensor platform is reported. The nanoparticle&#8208;polymer composite film provides tunable optical features, specifically those associated with the epsilon near zero and localized surface plasmon resonance regions of the plasmonic nanoparticles' optical response.








Abstract
Sensing technologies based on plasmonic nanomaterials are of interest for various chemical, biological, environmental, and medical applications. In this work, an incorporation strategy of colloidal plasmonic nanoparticles (pNPs) in microporous polymer for realizing distinct sorption&#8208;induced plasmonic sensing is reported. This approach is demonstrated by introducing tin&#8208;doped indium oxide pNPs into a polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM&#8208;1). The composite film (pNPs&#8208;polymer) provides distinct and tunable optical features on the fiber optic (FO) platform that can be used as a signal transducer for gas sensing (e.g., CO2) under atmospheric conditions. The resulting pNPs&#8208;polymer composite demonstrates high sensitivity response on FO in the evanescent field configuration, provided by the dramatic response of modes above the total&#8208;internal&#8208;reflection angle. Furthermore, by varying the pNPs content in the polymer matrix, the optical behavior of the pNPs&#8208;polymer composite film can be tuned to affect the operational wavelength by over several hundred nanometers and the sensitivity of the sensor in the near&#8208;infrared range. It is also shown that the pNPs&#8208;polymer composite film exhibits remarkable stability over a period of more than 10 months by mitigating the physical aging issue of the polymer.

The composite film (pNPs-polymer) provides distinct and tunable optical features on the fiber optic (FO) platform that can be used as a signal transducer for gas sensing (e.g., CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) under atmospheric conditions. The resulting pNPs-polymer composite demonstrates high sensitivity response on FO in the evanescent field configuration, provided by the dramatic response of modes above the total-internal-reflection angle. Furthermore, by varying the pNPs content in the polymer matrix, the optical behavior of the pNPs-polymer composite film can be tuned to affect the operational wavelength by over several hundred nanometers and the sensitivity of the sensor in the near-infrared range. It is also shown that the pNPs-polymer composite film exhibits remarkable stability over a period of more than 10 months by mitigating the physical aging issue of the polymer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Magnetization Control of Zero&#8208;Field Intrinsic Superconducting Diode Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zero&#8208;field SDE is demonstrated in Fe/Pt&#8208;inserted non&#8208;centrosymmetric Nb/V/Ta superconducting artificial superlattices with the magnetic toroidal moment. The periodic insertion of Fe with Pt into the superlattices increases the nonreciprocity of the critical current in the absence of a magnetic field. These findings can be utilized to realize non&#8208;volatile memories and logic circuits with ultralow power consumption.








Abstract
The superconducting diode effect (SDE), which causes a superconducting state in one direction and a normal&#8208;conducting state in another, has significant potential for developing ultralow power consumption circuits and non&#8208;volatile memory. However, the practical control of the SDE necessities the precise tuning of current, temperature, magnetic field, or magnetism. Therefore, the mechanisms of the SDE must be understood to develop novel materials and devices capable of realizing the SDE under more controlled and robust conditions. This study demonstrates an intrinsic zero&#8208;field SDE with an efficiency of up to 40% in Fe/Pt&#8208;inserted non&#8208;centrosymmetric Nb/V/Ta superconducting artificial superlattices. The polarity and magnitude of the zero&#8208;field SDE are controllable by the direction of magnetization, indicating that the effective exchange field acts on Cooper pairs. Furthermore, the first&#8208;principles calculation indicates that the SDE can be enhanced by an asymmetric configuration of proximity induced magnetic moments in superconducting layers, which induces a magnetic toroidal moment. This study has important implications regarding the development of novel materials and devices that can effectively control the SDE. Moreover, the magnetization control of the SDE is expected to aid in the designing of superconducting quantum devices and establishing a material platform for topological superconductors.

         <title>3d Printing of High Viscosity UV&#8208;curable Resin for Highly Stretchable And Resilient Elastomer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Vat photopolymerization prepared elastomers usually exhibit unsatisfied mechanical properties due to their insufficient growth of molecular weight upon UV exposure. Increasing the weight ratio of oligomer in the resin system is an effective approach to enhance the mechanical properties, yet the viscosity of the UV&#8208;curable resin increased dramatically which makes it difficult to be used. Here, a linear scan&#8208;based vat photopolymerization (LSVP) system which can print high&#8208;viscosity resin was carried out to 3D print the oligomer&#8208;dominated UV&#8208;curable resin via a dual&#8208;curing mechanism. Briefly, a polyurethane methacrylate blocking (PUB) oligomer is first synthesized and then mixed with a commercialized bifunctional oligomer, photoinitiator, and primary amine as a chain extender to prepare high&#8208;viscosity UV&#8208;curable resin for LSVP system. Through thermal treatment, deblocked isocyanate is further crosslinked with a chain extender to construct a highly entangled polymer chain network. The optimal thermal treatment parameters are investigated. Simultaneously, the resilience of the 3D&#8208;printed elastomer was evaluated by continuous tensile loading and unloading tests. Subsequently, complex structured elastomers were printed, exhibiting favorable mechanical durability without defects. The results obtained from this work will provide a reference for preparing elastomeric devices with excellent physical properties and expand the application fields of vat photopolymerization.

         <title>Chirality Versus Symmetry: Electron's Spin Selectivity in Non&#8208;Polar Chiral Lead&#8208;Bromide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In the last decade, chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS), the spin&#8208;selective electron transport through chiral molecules, has been described in a large range of materials, from insulators to superconductors. Because more experimental studies are desired for the theoretical understanding of the CISS effect, chiral metal&#8208;halide semiconductors may contribute to the field thanks to their chiroptical and spintronic properties. In this regard, we use new chiral organic cations S&#8208;HP1A and R&#8208;HP1A (HP1A = 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;propyl&#8208;1&#8208;ammonium) to prepare two&#8208;dimensional (2D) chiral halide perovskites (HPs) which crystallize in the enantiomorphic space groups P43212 and P41212, respectively. The four&#8208;fold symmetry induces antiferroelectricity along the stacking axis which, combined to incomplete Rashba&#8208;like splitting in each individual 2D polar layer, results in rare spin textures in the band structure. As revealed by magnetic conductive&#8208;probe AFM measurements, these materials show CISS effect with partial spin polarization (&#177;40&#8208;45%). This incomplete effect is efficient enough to drive a chiro&#8208;spintronic device as demonstrated by the fabrication of spin valve devices with magnetoresistance responses up to 250 K. Therefore, these stable lead&#8208;bromide HP materials not only represent interesting candidates for spintronic applications but also reveal the importance of polar symmetry&#8208;breaking topology for spin selectivity.

         <title>Advancing Energy Harvesting Efficiency from A Single Droplet: A Mechanically Guided 4d Printed Elastic Hybrid Droplet&#8208;based Electricity Generator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A droplet possesses the ubiquity and potential to harvest a vast amount of energy. To exploit droplets effectively, a novel output enhancement strategy that can coexist and create synergy with the recently studied droplet&#8208;based electricity generator (DEG) and material/surface structure modification must be investigated. In this study, we first present a mechanical buckling&#8208;based 4D printed elastic hybrid droplet&#8208;based electricity generator (HDEG) consisting of a DEG and solid&#8208;solid triboelectric nanogenerator (S&#8208;S TENG). During the electricity generation process of the DEG by droplet impact, the HDEG structure, which is merged via a simple 4D printing technique, permits the conversion of dissipated energy into elastic energy, resulting in an S&#8208;S TENG output. The HDEG outputs are naturally integrated owing to the simultaneous activation of a single droplet, resulting in an approximately 30% improvement over the output of a single DEG. Internal and external parametric studies are performed as HDEG design guidelines. The HDEG exhibits a 25% better energy supply performance than that of a single DEG, demonstrating its applicability as a power source. This research proposes the way toward a hybrid system that efficiently harvests energy from ubiquitous droplets.

         <title>Threshold Modulative Artificial GABAergic Nociceptor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Gamma&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a crucial inhibitory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system. It modifies the signal threshold of the nociceptor, allowing it to react to external stimuli in various circumstances. Thus, GABAergic behaviors are critical characteristics of the adaptive behavior in life. Here, we report a threshold&#8208;modulative artificial GABAergic nociceptor for the first time at a Pt/Ti/Nb2O5&#8211;x/Al2O3&#8208;y/Pt/Ti (top to bottom) of the double charge trapping structure. The Al2O3&#8208;y layer contains deep defect states that function similarly to the GABA neurotransmitter in modulating the signal threshold. Meanwhile, the Nb2O5&#8211;x layer traps volatile charges and produces nociceptive behaviors. The combined dynamics of the two layers readily offer threshold&#8208;modulative GABAergic nociceptive behaviors. Based on these GABAergic behaviors, we demonstrate a method of implementing hot&#8208; and cold&#8208;sensitive thermoreceptors and show its potential applications in advanced sensory devices.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks And Their Composites for Chronic Wound Healing: From Bench to Bedside</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Chronic wounds are characterized by delayed and dysregulated healing processes. As such, they have emerged as an increasingly significant threat. The associated morbidity and socioeconomic toll are clinically and financially challenging, necessitating novel approaches in the management of chronic wounds. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are an innovative type of porous coordination polymers, with low toxicity and high eco&#8208;friendliness. Documented anti&#8208;bacterial effects and pro&#8208;angiogenic activity predestine these nanomaterials as promising systems for the treatment of chronic wounds. In this context, the therapeutic applicability and efficacy of MOFs remain to be elucidated. We, therefore, review structural&#8208;functional properties of MOFs and their composite materials and discuss how their multifunctionality and customizability could be leveraged as a clinical therapy for chronic wounds.

         <title>Recent Advances and Opportunities of Eco&#8208;Friendly Ternary Copper Halides: A New Superstar in Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ternary copper halides (TCHs) have generated considerable attention for the exceptional structure diversity and fascinating optoelectronic properties. The recent advances of currently explored TCHs are systemically summarized, regarding the crystal and electronic structure, synthesis strategy, photophysical mechanism, luminescence regulation, environmental stability, and their emerging applications. Moreover, current existing challenges and possible development directions are proposed for their further development.








Abstract
Recently, the newly&#8208;emerging lead&#8208;free metal&#8208;halide materials with less toxicity and superior optoelectronic properties have received wide attention as the safer and potentially more robust alternatives to lead&#8208;based perovskite counterparts. Among them, ternary copper halides (TCHs) have become a vital group due to their unique features, including abundant structural diversity, ease of synthesis, unprecedented optoelectronic properties, high abundance, and low cost. Although the recent efforts in this field have made certain progresses, some scientific and technological issues still remain unresolved. Herein, a comprehensive and up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview of recent progress on the fundamental characteristics of TCH materials and their versatile applications is presented, which contains topics such as: i) crystal and electronic structure features and synthesis strategies; ii) mechanisms of self&#8208;trapped excitons, luminescence regulation, and environmental stability; and iii) their burgeoning optoelectronic devices of phosphor&#8208;converted white light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs), electroluminescent LEDs, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, X&#8208;ray scintillators, photodetectors, sensors, and memristors. Finally, the current challenges together with future perspectives on the development of TCH materials and applications are also critically described, which is considered to be critical for accelerating the commercialization of these rapidly evolving technologies.

         <title>J&#8208;Aggregation Strategy Toward Potentiated NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence Bioimaging of Molecular Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Molecular fluorophores emitting in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700 nm) window with strong optical harvesting and high quantum yields hold great potential for in vivo deep&#8208;tissue bioimaging and high&#8208;resolution biosensing. Recently, J&#8208;aggregates are harnessed to engineer long&#8208;wavelength NIR&#8208;II emitters and show unique superiority in tumor detection, vessel mapping, surgical navigation, and phototheranostics due to their bathochromic&#8208;shifted optical bands in the required slip&#8208;stacked arrangement aggregation state. However, despite the preliminary progress of NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates and theoretical study of structure&#8208;property relationships, further paradigms of NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates remain scarce due to the lack of study on aggregated fluorophores with slip&#8208;stacked fashion. In this effort, we emphatically elucidate how to utilize the specific molecular structure to form slip&#8208;stacked packing motifs with J&#8208;type aggregated exciton coupling. Firstly, several molecular regulating strategies to achieve NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates containing intermolecular interactions and external conditions are positively summarized and deeply analyzed. Then, the recent reports on J&#8208;aggregates for NIR&#8208;II bioimaging and theranostics are systematically summarized to provide a clear reference and direction for promoting the development of NIR&#8208;II organic fluorophores. Eventually, the prospective efforts on ameliorating and promoting NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates to further clinical practices are outlined.

         <title>Engineered Bio&#8208;Heterojunction Confers Extra&#8208; and Intracellular Bacterial Ferroptosis and Hunger&#8208;Triggered Cell Protection for Diabetic Wound Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanomaterial&#8208;mediated ferroptosis has garnered considerable interest in the antibacterial field, as it invokes the disequilibrium of ion homeostasis and boosts lipid peroxidation in extra&#8208; and intracellular bacteria. However, current ferroptosis&#8208;associated antibacterial strategies indiscriminately pose damage to healthy cells, ultimately compromising their biocompatibility. To address this daunting issue, we have designed a precise ferroptosis bio&#8208;heterojunction (F&#8208;bio&#8208;HJ) consisting of Fe2O3, Ti3C2&#8208;MXene, and glucose oxidase (GOx) to induce extra&#8208;intracellular bacteria&#8208;targeted ferroptosis for infected diabetic cutaneous regeneration. Fe2O3/Ti3C2&#8208;MXene@GOx (FMG) catalytically generates a considerable amount of ROS which assaults the membrane of extracellular bacteria, facilitating the permeation of synchronously generated Fe2+/Fe3+ into bacteria under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation, causing planktonic bacterial death via ferroptosis, Fe2+ overload, and lipid peroxidation. Additionally, FMG facilitates intracellular bacterial ferroptosis by transporting Fe2+ into intracellular bacteria via inward ferroportin (FPN). With GOx consuming glucose, FMG creates hunger protection which helps macrophages escape cell ferroptosis by activating the adenosine 5&#8216;&#8208;monophosphate (AMP)&#8208;activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. In vivo results authenticate that FMG boosts diabetic infectious cutaneous regeneration without triggering ferroptosis in normal cells. As envisaged, the proposed tactic provides a promising approach to combat intractable infections by precisely terminating extra&#8208;intracellular infection via steerable ferroptosis, thereby markedly elevating the biocompatibility of therapeutic ferroptosis&#8208;mediated strategies.

         <title>Ion Diode&#8208;like Heterojunction for Improving Electricity Generation from Water Droplets by Capillary Infiltration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Water&#8208;droplet&#8208;based electricity generators are emerging hydrovoltaic technologies that harvest energy from water circulation through strong interactions between water and nanomaterials. However, such devices exhibit poor current performance owing to their unclear driving force (evaporation or infiltration) and undesirable reverse diffusion current. Herein, a water&#8208;droplet&#8208;based hydrovoltaic electricity generator induced by capillary infiltration was fabricated with an asymmetric structure composed of a diode&#8208;like heterojunction formed by negatively and positively charged materials. This device generated current densities of 160 and 450&#160;&#956;A cm&#8722;2 at room temperature and 65&#176;C, respectively. The heterojunction achieved a rectification ratio of 12, which effectively suppressed the reverse current caused by concentration differences. This resulted in improved charge accumulation of approximately 60 mC cm&#8722;2 in 1000 s, which was three times the value observed in the control device. When the area of the device was increased to 6 cm2, the current increased linearly to 1&#160;mA, thus demonstrating the scale&#8208;up potential of the generator. The driving force of the streaming potential is primarily capillary infiltration, and rectification had not been previously observed. The proposed method of constructing ion&#8208;diode&#8208;like structures provides a new strategy for improving generator performance.

         <title>Efficient Surfactant&#8208;Mediated Photovoltaic Manipulation of Fl&#8208;Scale Aqueous Microdroplets for Diverse Optofluidic Applications on LiNbO3 Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The electrodeless biocompatible manipulation of femtoliter&#8208;scale aqueous microdroplets remains challenging to date. The appropriate isolation of electrostatic charges from fL&#8208;scale aqueous microdroplets is crucial for electrodeless optoelectronic manipulation based on space&#8208;charge&#8208;density modulation. Here, we propose surfactant&#8208;mediated photovoltaic manipulation, in which the surfactant layers self&#8208;assembled at the water&#8208;oil and oil&#8208;LN interfaces are employed to isolate photovoltaic charges. The reduced electrostatic attenuation, remarkable hydrophobicity, and strong electrical breakdown suppression of the surfactant layers enable the stable and swift manipulation of fL&#8208;scale aqueous microdroplets using &#956;W&#8208;level laser in an oil medium. By virtue of the surfactant&#8208;mediated photovoltaic manipulation, we realized a controllable merging/touching/detaching switch of aqueous microdroplets by adjusting the laser illumination intensity and position and demonstrated the cascading biochemical operations and microreactions of aqueous microdroplets and microdroplet strings. To demonstrate its potential in photonic MEMS assemblies, we demonstrated the end coupling of a tightly focused&#8208;laser&#8208;beam into a ZnO microrod leveraging the refraction effect occurring at the water/oil interface. Moreover, because of the selective permeability of the droplet&#8208;interface&#8208;bilayer developed between the touching microdroplets, we achieved in situ adjustment of the size of the microdroplets and the fluorescent solute contained in the microdroplets, aiming at constructing multicomponent fluorescent microdroplets with tunable whispering&#8208;gallery&#8208;mode (WGM) characteristics.

&lt;p&gt;The electrodeless biocompatible manipulation of femtoliter-scale aqueous microdroplets remains challenging to date. The appropriate isolation of electrostatic charges from fL-scale aqueous microdroplets is crucial for electrodeless optoelectronic manipulation based on space-charge-density modulation. Here, we propose surfactant-mediated photovoltaic manipulation, in which the surfactant layers self-assembled at the water-oil and oil-LN interfaces are employed to isolate photovoltaic charges. The reduced electrostatic attenuation, remarkable hydrophobicity, and strong electrical breakdown suppression of the surfactant layers enable the stable and swift manipulation of fL-scale aqueous microdroplets using &#956;W-level laser in an oil medium. By virtue of the surfactant-mediated photovoltaic manipulation, we realized a controllable merging/touching/detaching switch of aqueous microdroplets by adjusting the laser illumination intensity and position and demonstrated the cascading biochemical operations and microreactions of aqueous microdroplets and microdroplet strings. To demonstrate its potential in photonic MEMS assemblies, we demonstrated the end coupling of a tightly focused-laser-beam into a ZnO microrod leveraging the refraction effect occurring at the water/oil interface. Moreover, because of the selective permeability of the droplet-interface-bilayer developed between the touching microdroplets, we achieved in situ adjustment of the size of the microdroplets and the fluorescent solute contained in the microdroplets, aiming at constructing multicomponent fluorescent microdroplets with tunable whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Tuneable Anisotropic Plasmonics with Shape&#8208;Symmetric Conducting Polymer Nanoantennas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A wide range of nanophotonic applications rely on polarization&#8208;dependent plasmonic resonances, which usually requires metallic nanostructures that have anisotropic shape. Here, we demonstrate polarization&#8208;dependent plasmonic resonances by instead breaking symmetry via material permittivity. We show that molecular alignment of a conducting polymer can lead to a material with polarization&#8208;dependent plasma frequency and corresponding in&#8208;plane hyperbolic permittivity region. This result is not expected based only on anisotropic charge mobility but implies that also the effective mass of the charge carriers becomes anisotropic upon polymer alignment. We use this unique feature to demonstrate circularly symmetric nanoantennas that provide different plasmonic resonances parallel and perpendicular to the alignment direction. The nanoantennas are further tuneable via the redox state of the polymer. Importantly, polymer alignment could blue&#8208;shift the plasma wavelength and resonances by several hundreds of nanometers, forming a novel approach towards reaching the ultimate goal of redox&#8208;tunable conducting polymer nanoantennas for visible light.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis and Excited&#8208;State Dynamics of Null Exciton&#8208;Coupled Diketopyrrolopyrroles Oligo&#8208;Grids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent diketopyrrolopyrrole dimer [2]Grid and trimer [3]Grid with cyclic rigid structures are synthesized via one&#8208;pot Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction. They both display null exciton couplings and solvent&#8208;dependent excited&#8208;state dynamics. In toluene, they exhibit monomer&#8208;like photophysical properties. However, in benzonitrile, especially [2]Grid forms the symmetry&#8208;broken charge&#8208;separated state faster and more efficiently, which further recombines to generate the triplet excited state.








Abstract
Exciton coupling in molecular aggregates plays a vital role in impacting and fine&#8208;tuning optoelectronic materials and their efficiencies in devices. A versatile platform to decipher aggregation&#8208;property relationships is built around multichromophoric architectures. Here, a series of cyclic diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) oligomers featuring nanoscale gridarene structures and rigid bifluorenyl spacers are designed and synthesized via one&#8208;pot Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction. DPP dimer [2]Grid and trimer [3]Grid, which are cyclic rigid nanoarchitectures of rather different sizes, are further characterized via steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies. They exhibit monomer&#8208;like spectroscopic signatures in the steady&#8208;state measurements, from which null exciton couplings are derived. Moreover, in an apolar solvent, high fluorescence quantum yields and excited&#8208;state dynamics that resembled DPP monomer are gathered. In a polar solvent, the localized singlet excited state on a single DPP dissociates into the adjacent null coupling DPP with charge transfer characteristics. This pathway facilitates the evolution of&#160;the symmetry&#8208;broken charge&#8208;separated state (SB&#8208;CS). Notable is the fact that the SB&#8208;CS of [2]Grid is, on one hand, in equilibrium with the singlet excited state and promotes, on the other hand, the formation of the triplet excited state with a yield of 32% via charge recombination.

         <title>Understanding and Suppressing Non&#8208;Radiative Recombination Losses in Non&#8208;Fullerene Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Minimizing non&#8208;radiative recombination losses in the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art non&#8208;fullerene solar cells is of utmost importance in order to achieve power conversion efficiencies over 20% in the future. This review discusses methods to accurately quantify non&#8208;radiative voltage losses as well as the current understanding of their origin and empirical strategies for reducing them.








Abstract
Organic solar cells benefit from non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFA) due to their high absorption coefficients, tunable frontier energy levels, and optical gaps, as well as their relatively high luminescence quantum efficiencies as compared to fullerenes. Those merits result in high yields of charge generation at a low or negligible energetic offset at the donor/NFA heterojunction, with efficiencies over 19% achieved for single&#8208;junction devices. Pushing this value significantly over 20% requires an increase in open&#8208;circuit voltage, which is currently still well below the thermodynamic limit. This can only be achieved by reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination, and hereby increasing the electroluminescence quantum efficiency of the photo&#8208;active layer. Here, current understanding of the origin of non&#8208;radiative decay, as well as an accurate quantification of the associated voltage losses are summarized. Promising strategies for suppressing these losses are highlighted, with focus on new material design, optimization of donor&#8211;acceptor combination, and blend morphology. This review aims at guiding researchers in their quest to find future solar harvesting donor&#8211;acceptor blends, which combine a high yield of exciton dissociation with a high yield of radiative free carrier recombination and low voltage losses, hereby closing the efficiency gap with inorganic and perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>A Hyperspectral Camouflage Colorant Inspired by Natural Leaves</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The unmet spectral mimicry of foliar green in camouflage materials has been hampered by the lack of colorants with similar spectral properties to chlorophyll, resulting in substantial risks of exposure from hyperspectral target detection. By drawing inspiration from leaf chromogenesis, a microcapsule colorant with a chloroplast&#8208;like structure and chlorophyll&#8208;like absorption is developed, and a generic bilayer coating is designed to provide high spectral similarity to leaves with different growth stages, seasons and species. Specifically, the microcapsule colorant preserves the monomeric absorption of the internal phthalocyanine and features the manufacturability of conventional pigments, such as amenability to painting and patterning, and compatibility to different substrates. The pigmented artificial leaves successfully deceive the hyperspectral classification algorithm in a foliar background, and outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;art spectral simulation materials. This coloration strategy expands the knowledge base of the spectral fine tuning of composite colorants, which are essential for their application in spectral&#8208;resolved optical materials.

         <title>Embedded Host/Guest Alloy Aggregations Enable High&#8208;Performance Ternary Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ternary strategy has been intensively studied to improve the power conversion efficiencies of organic photovoltaics. Thereinto, the location of the guest component plays a critical role, but few reports have devoted to this concern. Hereon, we disclose the distribution of LA1 as guest acceptor in varieties of ternary scenarios, and outline the dominating driving forces of managing the guest distribution and operating modes. Governed by appropriate relationship of compatibility, crystallinity, and surface energies between host and guest acceptors, as well as interfacial interactions between donor and dual acceptors, most of the LA1 molecules permeate into the internal of host acceptor phases, forming embedded host/guest alloy&#8208;like aggregations. The characteristic distributions greatly optimize the morphologies, maximize energy transfer, and enhance exciton/charge behaviors. Particularly, PM6:IT&#8208;4F:LA1 ternary cells afford high efficiency of 15.27% with impressive fill factors (FF) over 81%. The popularization studies further verify the superiority of the LA1&#8208;involved alloy structures, and with Y6&#8208;family acceptor as host component, an outstanding efficiency of 19.17% was received. The results highlight the importance of guest distribution in ternary systems, and shed light on the governing factors of distributing the guests in ternary cells.

Hereon, we disclose the distribution of LA1 as guest acceptor in varieties of ternary scenarios, and outline the dominating driving forces of managing the guest distribution and operating modes. Governed by appropriate relationship of compatibility, crystallinity, and surface energies between host and guest acceptors, as well as interfacial interactions between donor and dual acceptors, most of the LA1 molecules permeate into the internal of host acceptor phases, forming embedded host/guest alloy-like aggregations. The characteristic distributions greatly optimize the morphologies, maximize energy transfer, and enhance exciton/charge behaviors. Particularly, PM6:IT-4F:LA1 ternary cells afford high efficiency of 15.27% with impressive fill factors (FF) over 81%. The popularization studies further verify the superiority of the LA1-involved alloy structures, and with Y6-family acceptor as host component, an outstanding efficiency of 19.17% was received. The results highlight the importance of guest distribution in ternary systems, and shed light on the governing factors of distributing the guests in ternary cells.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>An On&#8208;Demand Collaborative Innate&#8208;Adaptive Immune Response to Infection Treatment</title>

Abstract
Deep tissue infection is a common clinical issue and therapeutic difficulty caused by the disruption of the host antibacterial immune function, resulting in treatment failure and infection relapse. Intracellular pathogens are refractory to elimination and can manipulate host cell biology even after appropriate treatment, resulting in a locoregional immunosuppressive state that leads to an inadequate response to conventional anti&#8208;infective therapies. Here, we report a novel antibacterial strategy involving autogenous immunity using a biomimetic nanoparticle (NP)&#8208;based regulating system to induce in&#8208;situ collaborative innate&#8208;adaptive immune responses. We observed that a macrophage membrane coating facilitated NP enrichment at the infection site, followed by active NP accumulation in macrophages in a mannose&#8208;dependent manner. These NP&#8208;armed macrophages exhibited considerably improved innate capabilities, including more efficient intracellular ROS generation and pro&#8208;inflammatory factor secretion, M1 phenotype promotion, and effective eradication of invasive bacteria. Furthermore, the reprogrammed macrophages directed T cell activation at infectious sites, resulting in a robust adaptive antimicrobial immune response to ultimately achieve bacterial clearance and prevent infection relapse. Overall, these results provide a conceptual framework for a novel macrophage&#8208;based strategy for infection treatment via regulation of autogenous immunity.

         <title>A Breakthrough in Solution&#8208;Processed Ultra&#8208;Deep&#8208;Blue HLCT&#8208;OLEDs: A Record External Quantum Efficiency Exceeding 10% based on Novel V&#8208;Shaped Emitters</title>

Abstract
It has always been a great challenge to achieve high&#8208;efficiency solution&#8208;processed ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) 1931 chromaticity coordinates matching the blue primary of Rec. ITU&#8208;R BT.2100, which specifies high dynamic range television (HDR&#8208;TV) image parameters. Inspired by hybrid local and charge transfer (HLCT) excited state emitters improving exciton utilization through high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem system crossing, a series of high&#8208;performance blue emitters by a V&#8208;shaped symmetric D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D design strategy are developed in this study. Here, the large torsions and unstable bonds of D&#8208;A structures could be improved through &#960; bridges, and also the conjugation length and donor groups can be easily adjusted. The obtained emitters merit excellent photophysical and electrochemical properties, thermal stability, solution processibility, and HLCT excited state excellence. Results suggest that the OLEDs based on the obtained blue emitters all achieve high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of more than 8% with very low efficiency roll&#8208;off. In particular, the device based on FIP&#8208;CZ exhibits a satisfactory ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue emission (CIEx,y = 0.1579, 0.0387) and a record&#8208;high EQEmax (10.40%) among solution&#8208;processed HLCT&#8208;OLEDs, which is very close to the record EQEmax of devices by vacuum vapor deposition technology.

         <title>Stacking&#8208;Controlled Growth of rBN Crystalline Films with High Nonlinear Optical Conversion Efficiency up to 1%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Nonlinear optical crystals lie at the core of ultrafast laser science and quantum communication technology. The emergence of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials provides a revolutionary potential for nonlinear optical crystals due to their exceptionally high nonlinear coefficients. However, uncontrolled stacking orders generally induce the destructive nonlinear response due to the optical phase deviation in different 2D layers. Therefore, conversion efficiency of 2D nonlinear crystals is typically limited to less than 0.01% (far below the practical criterion of &gt;1%). Here, we controllably synthesize crystalline films of rhombohedral boron nitride (rBN) with parallel stacked layers. This success is realized by the utilization of vicinal FeNi (111) single crystal, where both the unidirectional arrangement of BN grains into a single&#8208;crystal monolayer and the continuous precipitation of (B, N) source for thick layers are guaranteed. The preserved in&#8208;plane inversion asymmetry in rBN films keeps the in&#8208;phase second harmonic generation field in every layer and leads to a record&#8208;high conversion efficiency of 1% in the whole family of 2D materials within the coherence thickness of only 1.6&#160;&#956;m. Our work provides a route for designing ultrathin nonlinear optical crystals from 2D materials, and will promote the on&#8208;demand fabrication of integrated photonic and compact quantum optical devices.

         <title>Pyrochlore&#8208;Type Iron Hydroxy Fluorides as Low&#8208;Cost Lithium&#8208;Ion Cathode Materials for Stationary Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Pyrochlore&#8208;type iron (III) hydroxy fluorides (Pyr&#8208;IHF) are appealing low&#8208;cost stationary energy storage materials due to the virtually unlimited supply of their constituent elements, their high energy densities and fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion. However, the prohibitively high cost of synthesis and cathode architecture currently prevent their commercial use in low&#8208;cost Li&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, we present a facile and cost&#8208;effective dissolution&#8208;precipitation synthesis of Pyr&#8208;IHF from soluble iron (III) fluoride precursors. High capacity retention by synthesized Pyr&#8208;IHF of &gt; 80% after 600&#160;cycles at a high current density of 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8208;1 was obtained, without elaborate electrode engineering. Operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction guided the selective synthesis of Pyr&#8208;IHF such that different water contents could be tested for their effect on the rate capability. Li&#8208;ion diffusion was found to occur in the 3D hexagonal channels of Pyr&#8208;IHF, formed by corner&#8208;sharing FeF6&#8208;x(OH)x octahedra.

         <title>PD&#8208;L1 Antibody&#8208;Conjugated PAMAM Dendrimer Nanosystem for Simultaneously Inhibiting Glycolysis and Promoting Immune Response in Fighting Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy affecting women, yet current therapeutic strategies remain ineffective for patients with late&#8208;stage or metastatic disease. We report here an effective strategy for treating metastatic breast cancer. Specifically, we established a self&#8208;assembling dendrimer nanosystem decorated with an anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody for delivering a small interfering RNA (siRNA) to target PDK1, a protein kinase involved in cancer metabolism and metastasis. This nanosystem (named PPD) was designed to target PD&#8208;L1 for cancer specific delivery of the siRNA to inhibit PDK1 (named siPDK1) and modulate cancer metabolism while promoting PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 pathway&#8208;based immunotherapy. Indeed, PPD effectively protected siPDK1 from degradation and supported its specific delivery to cancer cells for downregulating PDK1 expression. This resulted in simultaneous inhibition of PDK1&#8208;induced glycolysis and the PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 pathway&#8208;related immune response, leading to potent inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis without any notable toxicity in tumor&#8208;bearing mouse models. Collectively, these results highlight the potential use of PPD as an effective and safe tumor&#8208;targeting therapy for breast cancer. This study constitutes a successful proof of principle exploiting the intrinsic features of tumor microenvironment and metabolism alongside unique self&#8208;assembling dendrimer platform to achieve specific tumor targeting and siRNA&#8208;based gene silencing in combined and precision cancer therapy.

         <title>In Situ Covalent Reinforcement of a Benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;Tricarboxamide Supramolecular Polymer Enables Biomimetic, Tough, and Fibrous Hydrogels and Bioinks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Creating fibrillar yet tough synthetic hydrogel and bioink remains highly desired. Inspired by collagen's covalent cross&#8208;linking of fibrils; herein, a benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) based synthetic supramolecular/covalent strategy is reported for creating a tough hydrogel and bioink. The bioink enables 3D bioprinting of hMSCs spheroids and supports cartilage&#8208;like tissue formation within the hydrogel.








Abstract
Synthetic hydrogels often lack the load&#8208;bearing capacity and mechanical properties of native biopolymers found in tissue, such as cartilage. In natural tissues, toughness is often imparted via the combination of fibrous noncovalent self&#8208;assembly with key covalent bond formation. This controlled combination of supramolecular and covalent interactions remains difficult to engineer, yet can provide a clear strategy for advanced biomaterials. Here, a synthetic supramolecular/covalent strategy is investigated for creating a tough hydrogel that embodies the hierarchical fibrous architecture of the extracellular matrix (ECM). A benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) hydrogelator is developed with synthetically addressable norbornene handles that self&#8208;assembles to form a and viscoelastic hydrogel. Inspired by collagen's covalent cross&#8208;linking of fibrils, the mechanical properties are reinforced by covalent intra&#8208; and interfiber cross&#8208;links. At over 90% water, the hydrogels withstand up to 550% tensile strain, 90% compressive strain, and dissipated energy with recoverable hysteresis. The hydrogels are shear&#8208;thinning, can be 3D bioprinted with good shape fidelity, and can be toughened via&#160;covalent cross&#8208;linking. These materials enable the bioprinting of human mesenchymal stromal cell (hMSC) spheroids and subsequent differentiation into chondrogenic tissue. Collectively, these findings highlight the power of covalent reinforcement&#160;of supramolecular fibers, offering a strategy for the bottom&#8208;up design of dynamic, yet tough, hydrogels and bioinks.

         <title>4D Additive&#8211;Subtractive Manufacturing of Shape Memory Ceramics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient, precise, and scalable four&#8208;dimensional (4D)&#160;additive&#8211;subtractive manufacturing paradigm for ceramics with multimode shape memory capabilities is developed. The balance between thermal expansion and shrinkage is the mechanism for ceramic 4D printing. A high flame ablation performance of complex&#8208;shaped ceramics is achieved with Al2O3&#8208;deposited SiOC&#8208;based nanocrystalline&#8208;amorphous dual&#8208;phase ceramic lattice structures.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;temperature structural materials, such as ceramics, is limited by their extremely high melting points and the difficulty in building complicated architectures. Four&#8208;dimensional (4D) printing helps enhance the geometrical flexibility of ceramics. However, ceramic 4D printing systems are limited by the separate processes for shape and material transformations, low accuracy of morphing systems, low resolution of ceramic structures, and their time&#8208;intensive nature. Here, a paradigm for a one&#8208;step shape/material transformation, high&#8208;2D/3D/4D&#8208;precision, high&#8208;efficiency, and scalable 4D additive&#8211;subtractive manufacturing of shape memory ceramics is developed. Original/reverse and global/local multimode shape memory capabilities are achieved using macroscale SiOC&#8208;based ceramic materials. The uniformly deposited Al2O3&#8208;rich layer on the printed SiOC&#8208;based ceramic lattice structures results in an unusually high flame ablation performance of the complex&#8208;shaped ceramics. The proposed framework is expected to broaden the applications of high&#8208;temperature structural materials in the aerospace, electronics, biomedical, and art fields.

         <title>Ultralow&#8208;Dielectric&#8208;Constant Atomic Layers of Amorphous Carbon Nitride Topologically Derived from MXene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic layers of amorphous carbon nitride (a&#8208;CN) are produced via topological conversion of MXene&#8208;Ti3CNTx under bromine vapor. The resultant a&#8208;CN layers possess a low density of 0.55 g cm&#8722;3 and a high sp3 C level of 35.7%. As a result, a very low dielectric constant of 1.69 at 100 kHz is achieved for the 310&#8208;nm&#8208;thickness a&#8208;CN film with a breakdown strength of 5.6 MV cm&#8722;1.








Abstract
Low&#8208;dielectric&#8208;constant materials such as silicon dioxide serving as interconnect insulators in current integrated circuit face a great challenge due to their relatively high dielectric constant of &#8776;4, twice that of the recommended value by the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems, causing severe parasitic capacitance and associated response delay. Here, novel atomic layers of amorphous carbon nitride (a&#8208;CN) are prepared via a topological conversion of MXene&#8208;Ti3CNTx under bromine vapor. Remarkably, the assembled a&#8208;CN film exhibits an ultralow dielectric constant of 1.69 at 100 kHz, much lower than the previously reported dielectric materials such as amorphous carbon (2.2) and fluorinated&#8208;doped SiO2 (3.6), ascribed to the low density of 0.55&#160;g cm&#8722;3 and high sp3 C level of 35.7%. Moreover, the a&#8208;CN film has a breakdown strength of 5.6 MV&#160;cm&#8722;1, showing great potential in integrated circuit application.

         <title>Shaping Synthetic Multicellular and Complex Multimaterial Tissues via Embedded Extrusion&#8208;Volumetric Printing of Microgels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The convergence of extrusion&#8208;based and volumetric bioprinting, with microgels as platform materials, provides the possibility to create complex structures on a cm3&#8208;scale in a fast and accurate manner. By leveraging the versatility of this platform, it is possible to introduce multi&#8208;material and multi&#8208;cellular features in user defined&#8208;architectures.








Abstract
In living tissues, cells express their functions following complex signals from their surrounding microenvironment. Capturing both hierarchical architectures at the micro&#8208; and macroscale, and anisotropic cell patterning remains a major challenge in bioprinting, and a bottleneck toward creating physiologically&#8208;relevant models. Addressing this limitation, a novel technique is introduced, termed Embedded Extrusion&#8208;Volumetric Printing (EmVP), converging extrusion&#8208;bioprinting and layer&#8208;less, ultra&#8208;fast volumetric bioprinting, allowing spatially pattern multiple inks/cell types. Light&#8208;responsive microgels are developed for the first time as bioresins (&#181;Resins) for light&#8208;based volumetric bioprinting, providing a microporous environment permissive for cell homing and self&#8208;organization. Tuning the mechanical and optical properties of gelatin&#8208;based microparticles enables their use as support bath for suspended extrusion printing, in which features containing high cell densities can be easily introduced. &#181;Resins can be sculpted within seconds with tomographic light projections into centimeter&#8208;scale, granular hydrogel&#8208;based, convoluted constructs. Interstitial microvoids enhanced differentiation of multiple stem/progenitor cells (vascular, mesenchymal, neural), otherwise not possible with conventional bulk hydrogels. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, EmVP is applied to create complex synthetic biology&#8208;inspired intercellular communication models, where adipocyte differentiation is regulated by optogenetic&#8208;engineered pancreatic cells. Overall, EmVP offers new avenues for producing regenerative grafts with biological functionality, and for developing engineered living systems and (metabolic) disease models.

         <title>Short Peptide Nanofiber Biomaterials Ameliorate Local Hemostatic Capacity of Surgical Materials and Intraoperative Hemostatic Applications in Clinics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Short peptide nanofiber biomaterials are an intriguing surgical tool to serve as functional hemostatic devices and have claimed more and more advantages over traditional biomaterials and formulations. The comparable aspects in surgical applications, hemostatic mechnism, and emerging medical devices are addressed comprehensively in multiple surgical specialties.








Abstract
Short designer self&#8208;assembling peptide (dSAP) biomaterials are a new addition to the hemostat group. It may provide a diverse and robust toolbox for surgeons to integrate wound microenvironment with much safer and stronger hemostatic capacity than conventional materials and hemostatic agents. Especially in noncompressible torso hemorrhage (NCTH), diffuse mucosal surface bleeding, and internal medical bleeding (IMB), with respect to the optimal hemostatic formulation, dSAP biomaterials are the ingenious nanofiber alternatives to make bioactive neural scaffold, nasal packing, large mucosal surface coverage in gastrointestinal surgery (esophagus, gastric lesion, duodenum, and lower digestive tract), epicardiac cell&#8208;delivery carrier, transparent matrix barrier, and so on. Herein, in multiple surgical specialties, dSAP&#8208;biomaterial&#8208;based nano&#8208;hemostats achieve safe, effective, and immediate hemostasis, facile wound healing, and potentially reduce the risks in delayed bleeding, rebleeding, post&#8208;operative bleeding, or related complications. The biosafety in vivo, bleeding indications, tissue&#8208;sealing quality, surgical feasibility, and local usability are addressed comprehensively and sequentially and pursued to develop useful surgical techniques with better hemostatic performance. Here, the state of the art and all&#8208;round advancements of nano&#8208;hemostatic approaches in surgery are provided.

     alt="Short Peptide Nanofiber Biomaterials Ameliorate Local Hemostatic Capacity of Surgical Materials and Intraoperative Hemostatic Applications in Clinics"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short peptide nanofiber biomaterials are an intriguing surgical tool to serve as functional hemostatic devices and have claimed more and more advantages over traditional biomaterials and formulations. The comparable aspects in surgical applications, hemostatic mechnism, and emerging medical devices are addressed comprehensively in multiple surgical specialties.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short designer self-assembling peptide (dSAP) biomaterials are a new addition to the hemostat group. It may provide a diverse and robust toolbox for surgeons to integrate wound microenvironment with much safer and stronger hemostatic capacity than conventional materials and hemostatic agents. Especially in noncompressible torso hemorrhage (NCTH), diffuse mucosal surface bleeding, and internal medical bleeding (IMB), with respect to the optimal hemostatic formulation, dSAP biomaterials are the ingenious nanofiber alternatives to make bioactive neural scaffold, nasal packing, large mucosal surface coverage in gastrointestinal surgery (esophagus, gastric lesion, duodenum, and lower digestive tract), epicardiac cell-delivery carrier, transparent matrix barrier, and so on. Herein, in multiple surgical specialties, dSAP-biomaterial-based nano-hemostats achieve safe, effective, and immediate hemostasis, facile wound healing, and potentially reduce the risks in delayed bleeding, rebleeding, post-operative bleeding, or related complications. The biosafety in vivo, bleeding indications, tissue-sealing quality, surgical feasibility, and local usability are addressed comprehensively and sequentially and pursued to develop useful surgical techniques with better hemostatic performance. Here, the state of the art and all-round advancements of nano-hemostatic approaches in surgery are provided. Relevant critical insights will inspire exciting investigations on peptide nanotechnology, next-generation biomaterials, and better promising prospects in clinics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Rapid Self&#8208;Pumping Organohydrogel Dressing with Hydrophilic Fractal Microchannels to Promote Burn Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid self&#8208;pumping organohydrogel with hydrophilic fractal hydrogel microchannels by a dynamic floating&#8208;colliding&#8208;coalescing process is prepared, realizing &#8776;30 times enhancement in draining water than pure hydrogel. The rapid self&#8208;pumping organohydrogel dressing can accelerate burn wound healing by reducing dermal cavity (&#8776;42.5%), accelerating hair follicles (&#8776;13.5 times) and blood vessels (&#8776;6.6 times) regeneration.








Abstract
Burn wounds pose great challenges for conventional dressings because massive exudates oversecreted from swollen tissues and blisters seriously delay wound healing. Herein, a self&#8208;pumping organohydrogel dressing with hydrophilic fractal microchannels is reported that can rapidly drain excessive exudates with &#8776;30 times enhancement in efficiency compared with the pure hydrogel, and effectively promote burn wound healing. A creaming&#8208;assistant emulsion interfacial polymerization approach is proposed to create the hydrophilic fractal hydrogel microchannels in the self&#8208;pumping organohydrogel through a dynamic floating&#8208;colliding&#8208;coalescing process of organogel precursor droplets. In a murine burn wound model, the rapid self&#8208;pumping organohydrogel dressings can markedly reduce dermal cavity by &#8776;42.5%, accelerate blood vessel regeneration by &#8776;6.6 times, and hair follicle regeneration by &#8776;13.5 times, compared with the commercial dressing (Tegaderm). This study paves an avenue for designing high&#8208;performance functional burn wound dressings.

         <title>Photoelectron &#8220;Bridge&#8221; in Van Der Waals Heterojunction for Enhanced Photocatalytic CO2 Conversion Under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Van der Waals heterojunctions as photocatalysts by traditional wet chemical methods encounter the challengeof charge transfer, because of steric hindrance and barriers caused by a large interfacial spacing. Introducing phosphoric acid molecules at the heterojunction interface acts as an electron "bridge" to eliminate the interfacial potential difference and create a photoelectron transport channel to promote the photocatalytic reaction.








Abstract
Constructing Van der Waals heterojunction is a crucial strategy to achieve excellent photocatalytic activity. However, in most Van der Waals heterojunctions synthesized by ex situ assembly, electron transfer encounters huge hindrances at the interface between the two components due to the large spacing and potential barrier. Herein, a phosphate&#8208;bridged Van der Waals heterojunction of cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc)/tungsten disulfide (WS2) bridged by phosphate (xCoPc&#8208;nPO4&#8722;&#8208;WS2) is designed and prepared by the traditional wet chemistry method. By introducing a small phosphate molecule into the interface of CoPc and WS2, creates an electron &#8220;bridge&#8221;, resulting in a compact combination and eliminating the space barrier. Therefore, the phosphate (PO4&#8722;) bridge can serve as an efficient electron transfer channel in heterojunction and can efficiently transmit photoelectrons from WS2 to CoPc under excited states. These excited photoelectrons are captured by the catalytic central Co2+ in CoPc and subsequently convert CO2 molecules into CO and CH4 products, achieving&#160;17&#8208;fold enhancement on the 3CoPc&#8208;0.6PO4&#8722;&#8208;WS2 sample compared to that of pure WS2. Introducing a small molecule &#8220;bridge&#8221; to create an electron transfer channel provides a new perspective in designing efficient photocatalysts for photocatalytic CO2 reduction into valuable products.

         <title>Printable High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable FAPbBr3 Perovskite Solar Cells for Multifunctional Building&#8208;Integrated Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ intermediate phase transition&#8208;controlled blade&#8208;coating method for FAPbBr3 perovskite solar cells is introduced, which obtains a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.86% based on hole transport layer&#8208;free structures of glass/FTO/SnO2/FAPbBr3/carbon. Semitransparent devices are fabricated and obtain high PCE of 8.61% at average visible light transmittance (AVT) =&#160;45% and PCE of 5.55% at AVT&#160;=&#160;53% for small devices and 10&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#160;cm2 modules, respectively.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) show great promise for next&#8208;generation building&#8208;integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) applications because of their abundance of raw materials, adjustable transparency, and cost&#8208;effective printable processing. Owing to the complex perovskite nucleation and growth control, the fabrication of large&#8208;area perovskite films for high&#8208;performance printed PSCs is still under active investigation. Herein, the study proposes an intermediate&#8208;phase&#8208;transition&#8208;assisted one&#8208;step blade coating for an intrinsic transparent formamidinium lead bromide (FAPbBr3) perovskite film. The intermediate complex optimizes the crystal growth path of FAPbBr3, resulting in a large&#8208;area, homogeneous, and dense absorber film. A champion efficiency of 10.86% with high open&#8208;circuit voltage up to 1.57&#160;V is obtained with a simplified device architecture of glass/FTO/SnO2/FAPbBr3/carbon. Moreover, the unencapsulated devices maintain 90% of their initial power conversion efficiency after aging at 75&#160;&#176;C for 1000&#160;h in ambient air, and 96% after maximum power point tracking for 500&#160;h. The printed semitransparent PSCs, with average visible light transmittance over 45%, demonstrate high efficiencies for both small devices (8.6%) and 10&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#160;cm2 modules (5.55%). Finally, the ability to customize the color, transparency, and thermal insulation properties of FAPbBr3 PSCs makes them high prospects as multifunctional BIPVs.

Two acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor&#8242;&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor type organic emitters named NTQ and BTQ with narrow optical gaps of 1.23 and 1.13 eV are employed as short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) applications. The resultant SWIR OLEDs based on NTQ show good SWIR radiation properties, with a maximal radiant exitance of 1.12 mW cm&#8208;2 at 1140 nm, one of the highest values for OLEDs emitting at SWIR region.








Abstract
Short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) have attracted great interest due to their potential applications in biological imaging, infrared lighting, optical communication, environmental monitoring, and surveillance. Due to an intrinsic limitation posed by the energy&#8208;gap law, achieving high&#8208;brightness in SWIR OLEDs remains a challenge. Herein, the study reports the use of novel A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8242;&#8211;D&#8211;A type small molecules NTQ and BTQ for high&#8208;performance SWIR OLEDs. Benefiting from multiple D&#8211;A effect in conjugated skeleton, the small molecules NTQ and BTQ exhibit narrow optical gaps of 1.23 and 1.13&#160;eV, respectively. SWIR electroluminescence (EL) emission from OLEDs based on NTQ and BTQ is achieved, with emission peaks at 1140 and 1175&#160;nm, respectively. Not only owing to a negligible efficiency roll&#8208;off across the full range of applied current density but also the ability to afford a high operation current density of 5200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, the resultant SWIR OLEDs based on NTQ exhibit a maximal radiant exitance of =1.12&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the NTQ&#8208;based OLEDs also possess sub&#8208;gap turn&#8208;on voltage of 0.85&#160;V, which is close to the physical limits derived from the generalized Kirchhoff and Planck equation. This work demonstrates that A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8242;&#8211;D&#8211;A type small molecules offer significant promise for NIR/SWIR emitting material innovations.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have attracted great interest due to their potential applications in biological imaging, infrared lighting, optical communication, environmental monitoring, and surveillance. Due to an intrinsic limitation posed by the energy-gap law, achieving high-brightness in SWIR OLEDs remains a challenge. Herein, the study reports the use of novel A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8242;&#8211;D&#8211;A type small molecules NTQ and BTQ for high-performance SWIR OLEDs. Benefiting from multiple D&#8211;A effect in conjugated skeleton, the small molecules NTQ and BTQ exhibit narrow optical gaps of 1.23 and 1.13&#160;eV, respectively. SWIR electroluminescence (EL) emission from OLEDs based on NTQ and BTQ is achieved, with emission peaks at 1140 and 1175&#160;nm, respectively. Not only owing to a negligible efficiency roll-off across the full range of applied current density but also the ability to afford a high operation current density of 5200&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the resultant SWIR OLEDs based on NTQ exhibit a maximal radiant exitance of =1.12&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, the NTQ-based OLEDs also possess sub-gap turn-on voltage of 0.85&#160;V, which is close to the physical limits derived from the generalized Kirchhoff and Planck equation. This work demonstrates that A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8242;&#8211;D&#8211;A type small molecules offer significant promise for NIR/SWIR emitting material innovations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>NbTe4 Phase&#8208;Change Material: Breaking the Phase&#8208;Change Temperature Balance in 2D Van der Waals Transition&#8208;Metal Binary Chalcogenide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study explores chalcogen&#8208;rich 2D transition&#8208;metal (TM)&#8208;chalcogenides' potential for phase&#8208;change memory. The focus is on the layered TM&#8208;chalcogenide NbTe4, showing a lower melting point and higher crystallization temperature than traditional phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) such as Ge2Sb2Te5. Further device evaluation demonstrates that NbTe4 is an excellent solution for current PCM issueslike poor thermal stability and the high Reset energy.








Abstract
2D van der Waals (vdW) transition metal di&#8208;chalcogenides (TMDs) have garnered significant attention in the nonvolatile memory field for their tunable electrical properties, scalability, and potential for phase engineering. However, their complex switching mechanism and complicated fabrication methods pose challenges for mass production. Sputtering is a promising technique for large&#8208;area 2D vdW TMD fabrication, but the high melting point (typically Tm &gt; 1000 &#176;C) of TMDs requires elevated temperatures for good crystallinity. This study focuses on the low&#8208;Tm 2D vdW TM tetra&#8208;chalcogenides and identifies NbTe4 as a promising candidate with an ultra&#8208;low Tm of around 447 &#176;C (onset temperature). As&#8208;grown NbTe4 forms an amorphous phase upon deposition that can be crystallized by annealing at temperatures above 272 &#176;C. The simultaneous presence of a low Tm and a high crystallization temperature Tc can resolve important issues facing current phase&#8208;change memory compounds, such as high Reset energies and poor thermal stability of the amorphous phase. Therefore, NbTe4 holds great promise as a potential solution to these issues.

         <title>Robust and Sustainable Indium Anode Leading to Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable approach for recycling non&#8208;sustainable indium to construct efficient and stable OSCs and scale&#8208;up modules is developed, achieving the impressive PCE of 18.92% and 15.20%, respectively. This interlayer significantly extends the thermal stability of derived OSCs with a T80 lifetime of &#8776;10&#160;000 h.








Abstract
The fast degradation of the charge&#8208;extraction interface at indium tin oxide (ITO) poses a significant obstacle to achieving long&#8208;term stability for organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, a sustainable approach for recycling non&#8208;sustainable indium to construct efficient and stable OSCs and scale&#8208;up modules is developed. It is revealed that the recovered indium chloride (InCl3) from indium oxide waste can be applied as an effective hole&#8208;selective interfacial layer for the ITO electrode (noted as InCl3&#8211;ITO anode) through simple aqueous fabrication, facilitating not only energy level alignment to photoactive blends but also mitigating parasitic absorption and charge recombination losses of the corresponding OSCs. As a result, OSCs and modules consisting of InCl3&#8211;ITO anodes achieve remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 18.92% and 15.20% (active area of 18.73 cm2), respectively. More importantly, the InCl3&#8211;ITO anode can significantly extend the thermal stability of derived OSCs, with an extrapolated T80 lifetime of &#8776;10&#160;000 h.

         <title>Exotic Electronic Properties of 2D Nanosheets Isolated from Liquid Phase Exfoliated Phyllosilicate Minerals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation is applied to common layered phyllosilicate crystals of mica and chlorite schist to fabricate high&#8208;yield nanosheet suspensions. Once commonly believed to be spectrally inactive, electrically insulating, and chemically inert, suspensions of micene and chlorene nanosheets are shown to have unique spectral fingerprints, tuneable bandgaps, and superlative electrochemical performances for the hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Spectrally inactive, electrically insulating, and chemically inert are adjectives broadly used to describe phyllosilicate minerals like mica and chlorite. Here, the above is disproved by demonstrating aqueous suspensions of liquid exfoliated nanosheets from five bulk mica types and chlorite schist. Nanosheet quality is confirmed via transmission electron and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopies, as well as electron diffraction. Through Raman spectroscopy, a previously unreported size&#8208; and layer&#8208;dependent spectral fingerprint is observed. When analyzing the high&#8208;yield suspensions (&#8776;1&#160;mg&#160;mL&#8722;1) through UV&#8211;vis spectroscopy, all phyllosilicates present bandgap (Eg) narrowing from &#8776;7&#160;eV in the bulk to &#8776;4&#160;eV for monolayers. Unusually, the bandgap is inversely proportional to the areal size (A) of the nanosheets, measured via atomic force microscopy. Due to an unrecorded quantum confinement effect, nanosheet electronic properties scale toward semiconducting behavior (bandgap &#8776;3&#160;eV) as nanosheet area increases. Furthermore, modeling X&#8208;ray diffraction spectra shows that the root cause of the initial bandgap narrowing is lattice relaxation. Finally, with their broad range of isomorphically substituted ions, phyllosilicate nanosheets show remarkable catalytic properties for hydrogen production.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Control of Cycloidal Spin Order in a Metallic Van der Waals Magnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systematic and reversible control of cycloidal spin order with strains is demonstrated in the metallic van der Waals magnet Cr1/3TaS2 via strain&#8208;induced Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interactions. The remarkable tunability of Cr1/3TaS2 exemplifies the great potential of layered chiral magnets for highly&#8208;efficient straintronic applications.








Abstract
The manipulation of magnetism through strain control is a captivating area of research with potential applications for low&#8208;power devices that do not require dissipative currents. Recent investigations of insulating multiferroics have unveiled tunable relationships among polar lattice distortions, Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interactions (DMI), and cycloidal spin orders that break inversion symmetry. These findings have raised the possibility of utilizing strain or strain gradient to manipulate intricate magnetic states by changing polarization. However, the effectiveness of manipulating cycloidal spin orders in &#8220;metallic&#8221; materials with screened magnetism&#8208;relevant electric polarization remains uncertain. In this study, the reversible strain control of cycloidal spin textures in a metallic van der Waals magnet, Cr1/3TaS2, through the modulation of polarization and DMI induced by strain is demonstrated. With thermally&#8208;induced biaxial strains and isothermally&#8208;applied uniaxial strains, systematic manipulation of the sign and wavelength of the cycloidal spin textures is realized, respectively. Additionally, unprecedented reflectivity reduction under strain and domain modification at a record&#8208;low current density are also discovered. These findings establish a connection between polarization and cycloidal spins in metallic materials and present a new avenue for utilizing the remarkable tunability of cycloidal magnetic textures and optical functionality in van der Waals metals with strain.

         <title>Synthesis of Zwitterionic CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals with Controlled Anisotropy using Surface&#8208;Selective Ligand Pairs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zwitterionic CsPbBr3 nanocrystals are synthesized with controlled anisotropy using a proposed &#8220;surface&#8208;selective ligand pairs&#8221; strategy. Combining experiments with density functional theory calculations, factors that govern the ligand binding affinity on different surface facets of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals are revealed. This study provides design rules for the further exploration of anisotropic lead halide perovskite nanocrystals.








Abstract
Mechanistic studies of the morphology of lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (LHP&#8208;NCs) are hampered by a lack of generalizable suitable synthetic strategies and ligand systems. Here, the synthesis of zwitterionic CsPbBr3 NCs is presented with controlled anisotropy using a proposed &#8220;surface&#8208;selective ligand pairs&#8221; strategy. Such a strategy provides a platform to systematically study the binding affinity of capping ligand pairs and the resulting LHP morphologies. By using zwitterionic ligands (ZwL) with varying structures, majority ZwL&#8208;capped LHP NCs with controlled morphology are obtained, including anisotropic nanoplatelets and nanorods, for the first time. Combining experiments with density functional theory calculations, factors that govern the ligand binding on the different surface facets of LHP&#8208;NCs are revealed, including the steric bulkiness of the ligand, the number of binding sites, and the charge distance between binding moieties. This study provides guidance for the further exploration of anisotropic LHP&#8208;NCs.

         <title>Sorption&#8208;Based Atmospheric Water Harvesting: Materials, Components, Systems, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
There is great potential for air humidity not only to provide water for drinking and agriculture, but also to be used for energy/fuel production, energy conservation, and humidity/thermal management. Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH) technology makes this possible even in dry regions. The purpose of this paper is to review comprehensively the materials, designs, components, and application of SAWH.








Abstract
Freshwater scarcity is a global challenge posing threats to the lives and daily activities of humankind such that two&#8208;thirds of the global population currently experience water shortages. Atmospheric water, irrespective of geographical location, is considered as an alternative water source. Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH) has recently emerged as an efficient strategy for decentralized water production. SAWH thus opens up a self&#8208;sustaining source of freshwater that can potentially support the global population for various applications. In this review, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of SAWH, considering its operation principle, thermodynamic analysis, energy assessment, materials, components, different designs, productivity improvement, scale&#8208;up, and application for drinking water, is first extensively explored. Thereafter, the practical integration and potential application of SAWH, beyond drinking water, for wide range of utilities in agriculture, fuel/electricity production, thermal management in building services, electronic devices, and textile are comprehensively discussed. The various strategies to reduce human reliance on natural water resources by integrating SAWH into existing technologies, particularly in underdeveloped countries, in order to satisfy the interconnected needs for food, energy, and water are also examined. This study further highlights the urgent need and future research directions to intensify the design and development of hybrid&#8208;SAWH systems for sustainability and diverse applications.

         <title>Flexible Organic Transistors for Biosensing: Devices and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible and stretchable organic transistors for biosensing are comprehensively reviewed, with detailed discussions on advanced functionalization strategies and the wide applications of organic transistors in wearable, implantable, and portable electronics, as well as neuromorphic biointerfaces. Special attention is paid to the innovations in stretchable devices and emerging e&#8208;skin and smart textiles. The remaining challenges and future opportunities are discussed.








Abstract
Flexible and stretchable biosensors can offer seamless and conformable biological&#8211;electronic interfaces for continuously acquiring high&#8208;fidelity signals, permitting numerous emerging applications. Organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) are ideal transducers for flexible and stretchable biosensing due to their soft nature, inherent amplification function, biocompatibility, ease of functionalization, low cost, and device diversity. In consideration of the rapid advances in flexible&#8208;OTFT&#8208;based biosensors and their broad applications, herein, a timely and comprehensive review is provided. It starts with a detailed introduction to the features of various OTFTs including organic field&#8208;effect transistors and organic electrochemical transistors, and the functionalization strategies for biosensing, with a highlight on the seminal work and up&#8208;to&#8208;date achievements. Then, the applications of flexible&#8208;OTFT&#8208;based biosensors in wearable, implantable, and portable electronics, as well as neuromorphic biointerfaces are detailed. Subsequently, special attention is paid to emerging stretchable organic transistors including planar and fibrous devices. The routes to impart stretchability, including structural engineering and material engineering, are discussed, and the implementations of stretchable organic transistors in e&#8208;skin and smart textiles are included. Finally, the remaining challenges and the future opportunities in this field are summarized.

         <title>Advances in In Vitro Models of Neuromuscular Junction: Focusing on Organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;Chip, Organoids, and Biohybrid Robotics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the advances in in vitro neuromuscular junction models with 2D and 3D cultures, from organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip and organoids to biohybrid robots, and introduces the related derivative techniques for functional analysis and stimulus methods, their application as disease models and for drug screening, and prospects for their future development and related challenges.








Abstract
The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a peripheral synaptic connection between presynaptic motor neurons and postsynaptic skeletal muscle fibers that enables muscle contraction and voluntary motor movement. Many traumatic, neurodegenerative, and neuroimmunological diseases are classically believed to mainly affect either the neuronal or the muscle side of the NMJ, and treatment options are lacking. Recent advances in novel techniques have helped develop in vitro physiological and pathophysiological models of the NMJ as well as enable precise control and evaluation of its functions. This paper reviews the recent developments in in vitro NMJ models with 2D or 3D cultures, from organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip and organoids to biohybrid robotics. Related derivative techniques are introduced for functional analysis of the NMJ, such as the patch&#8208;clamp technique, microelectrode arrays, calcium imaging, and stimulus methods, particularly optogenetic&#8208;mediated light stimulation, microelectrode&#8208;mediated electrical stimulation, and biochemical stimulation. Finally, the applications of the in vitro NMJ models as disease models or for drug screening related to suitable neuromuscular diseases are summarized and their future development trends and challenges are discussed.

         <title>Perovskite Smart Windows: The Light Manipulator in Energy&#8208;Efficient Buildings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Uncontrolled sunlight entering through windows contributes to substantial heating and cooling demands in buildings, which leads to high energy consumption from the buildings. Recently, perovskite smart windows have emerged as innovative energy&#8208;saving technologies, offering the potential to adaptively control indoor solar heat gain through their impressive sunlight modulation capabilities. Moreover, harnessing the high&#8208;efficiency photovoltaic properties of perovskite materials, these windows have the potential to generate power, thereby realizing more advanced windows with combined light modulation and energy harvesting capabilities. This review summarizes the recent advancements in various chromic perovskite materials for achieving light modulation, focusing on both perovskite structures and underlying switching mechanisms. The discussion also encompasses device engineering strategies for smart windows, including the improvement of their optical and transition performance, durability, combination with electricity generation, and the evaluation of their energy&#8208;saving performance in building applications. Furthermore, the challenges and opportunities associated with perovskite smart windows are explicated, aimed at stimulating more academic research and advancing their pragmatic implementation for building energy efficiency and sustainability.

         <title>Defect Driven Opto&#8208;Critical Phases Tuned for All&#8208;Solar Utilization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Materials imbued with uniformly dispersed, photo&#8208;responsive nanoparticles are instrumental in sustainable energy and photonic applications. Conventional methods, however, constrain their all&#8208;solar response. An innovative alternative is proposed: submerged photo&#8208;synthesis of crystallites (SPsC). It is shown that strategic doping with copper and oxygen vacancies can induce opto&#8208;critical phases from the non&#8208;stoichiometric tungstic acids (WO3&#183;H2O). These opto&#8208;critical phases enable a dynamic equilibrium shift in lattice defect stabilization, facilitating an unprecedented a whole solar wavelength response. This response manifests as photothermal, photo&#8208;assisted water evaporation, and photo&#8208;electrochemical characteristics. Harnessing all&#8208;solar energy, this one&#8208;pot SPsC strategy may steer the design and development of advanced oxide materials, enhancing functionality across diverse application domains.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials imbued with uniformly dispersed, photo-responsive nanoparticles are instrumental in sustainable energy and photonic applications. Conventional methods, however, constrain their all-solar response. An innovative alternative is proposed: submerged photo-synthesis of crystallites (SPsC). It is shown that strategic doping with copper and oxygen vacancies can induce opto-critical phases from the non-stoichiometric tungstic acids (WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). These opto-critical phases enable a dynamic equilibrium shift in lattice defect stabilization, facilitating an unprecedented a whole solar wavelength response. This response manifests as photothermal, photo-assisted water evaporation, and photo-electrochemical characteristics. Harnessing all-solar energy, this one-pot SPsC strategy may steer the design and development of advanced oxide materials, enhancing functionality across diverse application domains.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Optimum Design Configuration of Thin&#8208;Film Transistors And Quantum&#8208;Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes for Active&#8208;Matrix Displays</title>

Abstract
Active matrix (AM) quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) driven by thin&#8208;film transistors (TFTs) have attracted significant attention for use in next&#8208;generation displays. Several challenges remain for the realisation of AM&#8208;QLEDs, such as device design, fabrication process, and integration between QLEDs and TFTs, depending on their device structures and configurations. Herein, we demonstrate efficient and stable AM&#8208;QLEDs using conventional and inverted structured QLEDs (C&#8208; and I&#8208;QLEDs, respectively) combined with facile type&#8208;convertible (p&#8208; and n&#8208;type) single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (SWNT)&#8208;based TFTs. Based on the four possible configurations of the QLED&#8211;TFT subpixel, we compare the performance of the SWNT TFT&#8208;driven QLEDs and the fabrication process to determine the ideal configuration, taking advantage of each structure for AM&#8208;QLEDs. We also optimise the QLEDs and TFTs to maximise the performance of the AM&#8208;QLEDs&#8212;the inner shell composition of quantum dots and carrier type of TFTs&#8212;resulting in a maximum external quantum efficiency and operational lifetime (at an initial luminance of 100&#160;cd/m2) of 21.2% and 38,100,000&#160;h for the C&#8208;QLED, and 19.1% and 133,100,000&#160;h for the I&#8208;QLED, respectively. Finally, we successfully demonstrate a 5&#215;5 AM&#8208;QLED display array controlled using SWNT TFTs. This study is expected to contribute to the development of advanced AM&#8208;QLED displays.

&lt;p&gt;Active matrix (AM) quantum-dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) driven by thin-film transistors (TFTs) have attracted significant attention for use in next-generation displays. Several challenges remain for the realisation of AM-QLEDs, such as device design, fabrication process, and integration between QLEDs and TFTs, depending on their device structures and configurations. Herein, we demonstrate efficient and stable AM-QLEDs using conventional and inverted structured QLEDs (C- and I-QLEDs, respectively) combined with facile type-convertible (p- and n-type) single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT)-based TFTs. Based on the four possible configurations of the QLED&#8211;TFT subpixel, we compare the performance of the SWNT TFT-driven QLEDs and the fabrication process to determine the ideal configuration, taking advantage of each structure for AM-QLEDs. We also optimise the QLEDs and TFTs to maximise the performance of the AM-QLEDs&#8212;the inner shell composition of quantum dots and carrier type of TFTs&#8212;resulting in a maximum external quantum efficiency and operational lifetime (at an initial luminance of 100&#160;cd/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of 21.2% and 38,100,000&#160;h for the C-QLED, and 19.1% and 133,100,000&#160;h for the I-QLED, respectively.

         <title>Antibubbles Enable Tunable Payload Release with Low&#8208;Intensity Ultrasound</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The benefits of ultrasound are its ease&#8208;of&#8208;use and its ability to precisely deliver energy in opaque and complex media. However, most materials responsive to ultrasound show a weak response, requiring the use of high powers, which are associated with undesirable streaming, cavitation, or temperature rise. These effects hinder response control and may even cause damage to the medium where the ultrasound is applied. Moreover, materials that are currently in use rely on all&#8208;or&#8208;nothing effects, limiting the ability to fine&#8208;tune the response of the material on the fly. For these reasons, there is a need for materials that can respond to low intensity ultrasound with programmable responses. Here it is demonstrated that antibubbles are a low&#8208;intensity&#8208;ultrasound&#8208;responsive material system that can controllably release a payload using acoustic pressures in the kPa range. Varying their size and composition tunes the release pressure, and the response can be switched between a single release and stepwise release across multiple ultrasound pulses. Observations using confocal and high&#8208;speed microscopy revealed different ways that can lead to release. These findings lay the groundwork to design antibubbles that controllably respond to low&#8208;intensity ultrasound, opening a wide range of applications ranging from ultrasound&#8208;responsive material systems to carriers for targeted&#160;delivery.

         <title>A Personalized Cancer Nanovaccine that Enhances T&#8208;Cell Responses and Efficacy through Dual Interactions with Dendritic Cells and T Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Conventional approaches to developing therapeutic cancer vaccines that primarily activate tumor&#8208;specific T cells via dendritic cells (DCs) often demonstrate limited efficacy due to the suboptimal activation of these T cells. To address this limitation, here we develop a therapeutic cancer nanovaccine that enhances T cell responses by interacting with both DCs and T cells. The nanovaccine is based on a cancer cell membrane nanoparticle (CCM&#8208;MPLA) that utilizes monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) as an adjuvant. To allow direct interaction between the nanovaccine and tumor&#8208;specific T cells, anti&#8208;CD28 antibodies (aCD28) are conjugated onto CCM&#8208;MPLA, resulting in CCM&#8211;MPLA&#8211;aCD28. This nanovaccine activates tumor&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells in both presence and absence of DCs. Compared with nanovaccines that interact with either DCs (CCM&#8211;MPLA) or T cells (CCM&#8211;aCD28), CCM&#8211;MPLA&#8211;aCD28 induces more potent responses of tumor&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells and exhibits a higher antitumor efficacy in tumor&#8208;bearing mice. No differences in T cell activation efficiency and therapeutic efficacy are observed between CCM&#8211;MPLA and CCM&#8211;aCD28. This approach may lead to the development of effective personalized therapeutic cancer vaccines prepared from autologous cancer cells.

         <title>Introducing Phenyl End Group in The Inner Side Chains of A&#8208;Da'd&#8208;A Acceptors Enables High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells Processed with Nonhalogenated Solvent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) has reached the threshold for application. However, the high PCEs are mostly obtained from the small&#8208;area OSCs processed by the halogenated solvent, such as chloroform (CF), because the high&#8208;performance A&#8208;DA'D&#8208;A type small molecule acceptors (SMAs) need the CF processing for suitable solubility and rapid solvent evaporation to get appropriate aggregation morphology. Herein, we&#160;synthesized two new A&#8208;DA'D&#8208;A type SMAs of Y6&#8208;Ph and L8&#8208;Ph by introducing a phenyl end group in the branched alkyl inner side chains of the representative SMAs Y6 and L8&#8208;BO respectively, for overcoming the excessive aggregation of SMAs in the long&#8208;time film&#8208;forming process in the nonhalogenated solvent processing. Firstly, we&#160;studied the effect of the processing solvent boiling point on the aggregation property and photovoltaic performance of the four SMAs of Y6, L8&#8208;BO, Y6&#8208;Ph and L8&#8208;Ph, by using the most commonly used halogenated processing solvents: low&#8208;boiling&#8208;point CF (rapid film forming process) and high&#8208;boiling&#8208;point chlorobenzene (CB) (slow film forming process) for device fabrication of the OSCs with PM6 as polymer donor. It was&#160;found that the Y6&#8208; and L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based OSCs exhibit a dramatic drop in PCEs from CF&#8208; to CB&#8208;processed devices owing to the large phase separation in the CB&#8208;processed OSCs. On the contrary, the devices based on Y6&#8208;Ph and L8&#8208;Ph with the phenyl ending inner side chains show obviously increased PCEs for the OSCs processed by high&#8208;boiling&#8208;point CB. The L8&#8208;Ph&#8208;based devices processed by CB demonstrated an PCE of 18.83% with a high FF of 80.55%, which is even better than the L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based OSCs processed by CF. Furthermore, the L8&#8208;Ph&#8208;based OSCs processed by nonhalogenated solvent o&#8208;xylene (o&#8208;XY) also achieved a high PCE of 18.40% with an FF of 80.11%, which is the best&#8208;performed OSC fabricated from the nonhalogenated solvents so far. In addition, the large&#8208;area (1 cm2) OSCs based on PM6:L8&#8208;Ph processed by o&#8208;XY also demonstrated a higher PCE of 16.66%. The results indicate that introducing phenyl end group in the inner side chains is an effective strategy to improve photovoltaic performance of the A&#8208;DA'D&#8208;A SMAs for future application of the OSCs with nonhalogenated solvent processing.

         <title>Synthesis of 2H/fcc&#8208;Heterophase AuCu Nanostructures for Highly Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Reduction at Industrial Current Densities</title>

Abstract
Structural engineering of nanomaterials offers a promising way for developing high&#8208;performance catalysts towards catalysis. However, the delicate modulation of thermodynamically unfavorable nanostructures with unconventional phases still remains a challenge. Here, we report the synthesis of hierarchical AuCu nanostructures with hexagonal close&#8208;packed (2H&#8208;type)/face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) heterophase, high&#8208;index facets, planar defects (e.g., stacking faults, twin boundaries, and grain boundaries), and tunable Cu content. The obtained 2H/fcc Au99Cu1 hierarchical nanosheets exhibit excellent performance for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to produce CO, outperforming the 2H/fcc Au91Cu9 and fcc Au99Cu1. Our experimental results, especially those obtained by in situ differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy and attenuated total reflection Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy, suggest that the enhanced catalytic performance of 2H/fcc Au99Cu1 arises from the unconventional 2H/fcc heterophase, high&#8208;index facets, planar defects, and appropriate alloying of Cu. Impressively, the 2H/fcc Au99Cu1 shows CO Faradaic efficiencies of 96.6% and 92.6% at industrial current densities of 300 mA cm&#8722;2 and 500 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively, as well as good durability, placing it among the best CO2 reduction electrocatalysts for CO production. Our atomically structural regulation based on phase engineering of nanomaterials (PEN) provides an avenue for the rational design and preparation of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for various catalytic applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structural engineering of nanomaterials offers a promising way for developing high-performance catalysts towards catalysis. However, the delicate modulation of thermodynamically unfavorable nanostructures with unconventional phases still remains a challenge.

         <title>Exceptional Microscale Plasticity in Amorphous Aluminum Oxide at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Oxide glasses are an elementary group of materials in modern society, but brittleness limits their wider usability at room temperature. As an exception to the rule, amorphous aluminum oxide (a&#8208;Al2O3) is a rare diatomic glassy material exhibiting significant nanoscale plasticity at room temperature. Here we show experimentally that the room temperature plasticity of a&#8208;Al2O3 extends to the microscale and high strain rates using in situ micropillar compression. All tested a&#8208;Al2O3 micropillars deform without fracture at up to 50% strain via a combined mechanism of viscous creep and shear band slip propagation. Large&#8208;scale molecular dynamics simulations align with the main experimental observations and verify the plasticity mechanism at the atomic scale. The experimental strain rates reach magnitudes typical for impact loading scenarios, such as hammer forging, with strain rates up to the order of 1 000 s&#8722;1, and we expand the total a&#8208;Al2O3 sample volume exhibiting significant low&#8208;temperature plasticity without fracture by 5 orders of magnitude from previous observations. The discovery is consistent with the theoretical prediction that the plasticity observed in a&#8208;Al2O3 can extend to macroscopic bulk scale and suggests that amorphous oxides show significant potential to be used as light, high&#8208;strength, and damage&#8208;tolerant engineering materials.

         <title>Tuning Ligands Ratio Allows for Controlling Gold Nanocluster Conformation And Activating A Nonantimicrobial Thiol Fragrance for Effective Treatment of MRSA&#8208;induced Keratitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Bacterial keratitis is a serious ocular disease that affects millions of people worldwide each year, among which &#8764;25% are caused by Staphylococcus aureus. With the spread of bacterial resistance, refractory keratitis caused by methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) affects &#8764;120&#8211;190 thousand people annually and has become a significant cause of infectious blindness. Atomically precise gold nanoclusters (GNCs) have recently emerged as promising antibacterial agents, although how GNC structure and capping ligands control its antibacterial properties remain largely unexplored. In this study, by adjusting the ratio of a &#8220;bulky&#8221; thiol fragrance to a linear zwitterionic ligand, the GNC conformation is transformed from Au25(SR)18 to Au23(SR)16 species, simultaneously converting both inactive thiol ligands into potent antibacterial nanomaterials. Surprisingly, mixed&#8208;ligand capped Au23(SR)16 GNCs exhibit superior antibacterial potency compared to their mono&#8208;ligand counterparts. The optimal GNC is highly potent against MRSA, showing &gt;1024&#8208;fold lower minimum inhibitory concentration than the corresponding free ligands. Moreover, it displays excellent potency in treating MRSA&#8208;induced keratitis in mice with greatly accelerated corneal recovery (by &#8764;9&#8208;fold). Thus, this study establishes a feasible method to synthesize antibacterial GNCs by adjusting the ligand ratio to control GNC conformation and active non&#8208;antibacterial ligands, thereby greatly increasing the repertoires for combating multidrug&#8208;resistant bacterial infections.

         <title>Acid and Hypoxia Tandem&#8208;Activatable Deep Near&#8208;Infrared Nanoprobe for Two&#8208;Step Signal Amplification and Early Detection of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphorescent nanoprobe comprised of oxygen&#8208;sensitive deep near&#8208;infrared (dNIR)&#8208;emitting phosphorescence cores and acid&#8208;cleavable polyethene glycol (PEG) shells, that is ultrasensitive to tumor acidity and hypoxia. This tandem&#8208;activatable probe design specifically amplifies tumor signals and enables early tumor detection, the signal in deep NIR region promoting contrast and resolution of hypoxia imaging as well.








Abstract
The early detection of cancers can significantly change outcomes even with existing treatments. However, ~50% of cancers still cannot be detected until they reach an advanced stage, highlighting the great challenges in the early detection. Here, an ultrasensitive deep near&#8208;infrared (dNIR) nanoprobe that is successively responsive to tumor acidity and hypoxia is reported. It is demonstrated that the new nanoprobe specifically detects tumor hypoxia microenvironment based on deep NIR imaging in ten different types of tumor models using cancer cell lines and patient&#8208;tissue derived xenograft tumors. By combining the acidity and hypoxia specific two&#8208;step signal amplification with a deep NIR detection, the reported nanoprobe enables the ultrasensitive visualization of hundreds of tumor cells or small tumors with a size of 260&#160;&#181;m in whole&#8208;body imaging or 115&#160;&#181;m metastatic lesions in lung imaging. As a result, it reveals that tumor hypoxia can occur as early as the lesions contain only several hundred cancer cells.

         <title>Reduced Graphene Oxide Electrolyte&#8208;Gated Transistor Immunosensor with Highly Selective Multiparametric Detection of Anti&#8208;Drug Antibodies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrolyte&#8208;gated transistor immunosensor based on reduced graphene oxide (rGO&#8208;EGT) for the detection of anti&#8208;drug antibodies (ATIs) against the drug Infliximab is reported. The multiparametric analysis of the immunosensor response, with a theoretical limit of detection of 10 am, allows for the discrimination between ATIs and interfering agents.








Abstract
The advent of immunotherapies with biological drugs has revolutionized the treatment of cancers and auto&#8208;immune diseases. However, in some patients, the production of anti&#8208;drug antibodies (ADAs) hampers the drug efficacy. The concentration of ADAs is typically in the range of 1&#8211;10 pm; hence their immunodetection is challenging. ADAs toward Infliximab (IFX), a drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other auto&#8208;immune diseases, are focussed. An ambipolar electrolyte&#8208;gated transistor (EGT) immunosensor is reported based on a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) channel and IFX bound to the gate electrode as the specific probe. The rGO&#8208;EGTs are easy to fabricate and exhibit low voltage operations (&#8804; 0.3&#160;V), a robust response within 15&#160;min, and ultra&#8208;high sensitivity (10 am limit of detection). A multiparametric analysis of the whole rGO&#8208;EGT transfer curves based on the type&#8208;I generalized extreme value distribution is proposed. It is demonstrated that it allows to selectively quantify ADAs also in the co&#8208;presence of its antagonist tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#8208;&#945;), the natural circulating target of IFX.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Fatigue Hydrogel Electrolyte for All&#8208;Flexible Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The compressive fatigue&#8208;resistance properties of the hydrogel electrolytes are systematically explored, revealing the critical roles of the salt and copolymer matrix on crack initiation and propagation. The optimal hydrogel electrolytes endow the Zn metal anode with a superior cycling lifespan and demonstrate great potential in wearable electronics with all flexible features.








Abstract
Hydrogel electrolytes are widely explored in Zn metal batteries for application in wearable electronics. While extensive studies have been conducted on optimizing the chemical structure and boosting the tensile elasticity, the mechanical stability of the hydrogel under repeated deformation is largely overlooked, leading to unsatisfactory performance at large cycling capacity. This work systematically analyzes the compressive fatigue&#8208;resistance properties of the hydrogel electrolyte, revealing the critical roles of the salt and copolymer matrix on crack initiation and propagation. It shows that, on the premise of homogeneous Zn deposition, an improved anti&#8208;fatigue property is essential to achieve high&#8208;capacity Zn metal anodes. The optimal Zn(ClO4)2&#8208;polyacrylamide/chitosan hydrogel electrolyte (C&#8208;PAMCS) exhibits an unprecedented lifespan of 1500&#160;h for Zn//Zn cells at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a high areal capacity of 10 mAh cm&#8722;2. The potential application of C&#8208;PAMCS is exemplified in all&#8208;flexible Zn&#8208;ion batteries enabled by a flexible current collector consisting of a Ag nanowires embedded elastomer. This study provides the rationale under hydrogel electrolyte engineering toward advanced Zn&#8208;ion battereis and the application in flexible devices.

         <title>Component Distribution Regulation in Sn&#8208;Pb Perovskite Solar Cells through Selective Molecular Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disordered Sn/Pb ratio and heterojunctions in perovskite film can be suppressed through selective molecular interaction. Hydrazine sulfate (HS) is introduced in Sn perovskite precursor and reduces the crystallization rate of tin perovskite to the level of lead analog. Therefore, a Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite film with uniform component and energy distribution, as well as devices with low recombination loss are achieved.








Abstract
Tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with near&#8208;ideal bandgap still lag behind the pure lead PSCs. Disordered heterojunctions caused by inhomogeneous Sn/Pb ratio in the binary perovskite film induce large recombination loss. Here, an Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite film is reported with homogeneous component and energy distribution by introducing hydrazine sulfate (HS) in Sn perovskite precursor. HS can form hydrogen bond network and coordinate with FASnI3 thus no longer bond with Pb2+, which reduces the crystallization rate of tin perovskite to the level of lead analog. The strong bonding between SO42&#8722; and Sn2+ can also suppress its oxidation. As a result, the Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs with HS exhibit a significantly improved VOC of 0.91 V along with a high efficiency of 23.17%. Meanwhile, the hydrogen bond interaction network, strong bonding between Sn2+ and sulfate ion also improve the thermal, storage, and air stability of resulting devices.

         <title>Spatially Confined Silver Nanoparticles in Mercapto Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks to Compartmentalize Li Deposition Toward Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, Ag nanoparticles are chemically implanted into mercapto&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic frameworks, and the lithiophilic assemblies are utilized to modify Cu current collector for achieving reversible and dendrite&#8208;free Li plating/stripping. Owing to the compartmentalized Li storage, symmetric and full cells demonstrate prolonged cycling over 1500 and 1000&#160;cycles, respectively, with a near&#8208;unity Coulombic efficiency.








Abstract
As the promising next&#8208;generation energy storage solution, lithium metal battery (LMB) has gained great attention but still suffers from troubles associated with the highly active metallic lithium. Herein, it is&#160;aimed to develop an anode&#8208;free LMB engaging no Li disk or foil by modifying the Cu current collector with mercapto metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) impregnating Ag nanoparticles (NPs). While the polar mercapto groups facilitate and guide Li+ transport, the highly lithiophilic Ag NPs help to enhance the electric conductivity and lower the energy barrier of Li nucleation. Furthermore, the MOF pores allow compartmentalizing bulk Li into a 3D matrix Li storage so that not only the local current density is reduced, but also is the plating/stripping reversibility greatly enhanced. As a result, full cells pairing the prelithiated Ag@Zr&#8208;DMBD/Cu anodes with LiFePO4 cathodes demonstrate a high initial specific capacity of 159.8&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, first&#8208;cycle Coulombic efficiency of 96.6%, and long&#8208;term cycling stability over 1000&#160;cycles with 99.3% capacity retention at 1&#160;C. This study underlines the multi&#8208;aspect functionalization of MOFs to impart lithiophilicity, polarity, and porosity to achieve reversible Li plating/stripping and paves the way for realizing high&#8208;performance anode&#8208;free LMBs through exquisite modification of the Cu current collector.

         <title>Structural Color Mixing in Microcapsules through Exclusive Crystallization of Binary and Ternary Colloids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photonic microcapsules with dual or triple stopbands are created by exclusively crystallizing binary or ternary colloids in double&#8208;emulsion droplets. The controlled depletion attraction induces homogeneous particle association to produce distinct crystalline grains, preventing glassy alloy formation. The resulting microcapsules exhibit highly&#8208;saturated mixed structural colors that can be controlled through the selection of particle sizes and mixing ratios.








Abstract
Colloidal crystals are designed as photonic microparticles for various applications. However, conventional microparticles generally have only one stopband from a single lattice constant, which restricts the range of colors and optical codes available. Here, photonic microcapsules are created that contain two or three distinct crystalline grains, resulting in dual or triple stopbands that offer a wider range of colors through structural color mixing. To produce distinct colloidal crystallites from binary or ternary colloidal mixtures, the interparticle interaction is manipulated using depletion forces in double&#8208;emulsion droplets. Aqueous dispersions of binary or ternary colloidal mixtures in the innermost droplet are gently concentrated in the presence of a depletant and salt by imposing hypertonic conditions. Different&#8208;sized particles crystallize into their own crystals rather than forming random glassy alloys to minimize free energy. The average size of the crystalline grains can be adjusted with osmotic pressure, and the relative ratio of distinct grains can be controlled with the mixing ratio of particles. The resulting microcapsules with small grains and high surface coverage are almost optically isotropic and exhibit highly&#8208;saturated mixed structural colors and multiple reflectance peaks. The mixed color and reflectance spectrum are controllable with the selection of particle sizes and mixing ratios.

         <title>Wafer&#8208;Scale Epitaxial Growth of Two&#8208;dimensional Organic Semiconductor Single Crystals toward High&#8208;Performance Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anchored crystal&#8208;seed epitaxial growth method is developed to effectively suppress the multiple nucleation behavior of the molecules and enhance the 2D growth of organic crystals. In consequence, wafer&#8208;scale few&#8208;layer organic single crystals are successfully fabricated on the viscous liquid substrate. Organic field&#8208;effect transistors based on the crystal exhibit high device performance with excellent uniformity.








Abstract
The success of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electronics and optoelectronics relies heavily on the capability to fabricate semiconductor single&#8208;crystal wafers. However, the conventional epitaxial growth strategy for inorganic wafers is invalid for growing organic semiconductor single crystals due to the lack of lattice&#8208;matched epitaxial substrates and intricate nucleation behaviors, severely impeding the advancement of organic single&#8208;crystal electronics. Here, an anchored crystal&#8208;seed epitaxial growth method for wafer&#8208;scale growth of 2D organic semiconductor single crystals is developed for the first time. The crystal seed is firmly anchored on the viscous liquid surface, ensuring the steady epitaxial growth of organic single crystals from the crystal seed. The atomically flat liquid surface effectively eliminates the disturbance from substrate defects and greatly enhances the 2D growth of organic crystals. Using this approach, a wafer&#8208;scale few&#8208;layer bis(triethylsilythynyl)&#8208;anthradithphene (Dif&#8208;TES&#8208;ADT) single crystal is formed, yielding a breakthrough for organic field&#8208;effect transistors with a high reliable mobility up to 8.6 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and an ultralow mobility variable coefficient of 8.9%. This work opens a new avenue to fabricate organic single&#8208;crystal wafers for high&#8208;performance organic electronics.

Here, an anchored crystal-seed epitaxial growth method for wafer-scale growth of 2D organic semiconductor single crystals is developed for the first time. The crystal seed is firmly anchored on the viscous liquid surface, ensuring the steady epitaxial growth of organic single crystals from the crystal seed. The atomically flat liquid surface effectively eliminates the disturbance from substrate defects and greatly enhances the 2D growth of organic crystals. Using this approach, a wafer-scale few-layer bis(triethylsilythynyl)-anthradithphene (Dif-TES-ADT) single crystal is formed, yielding a breakthrough for organic field-effect transistors with a high reliable mobility up to 8.6 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and an ultralow mobility variable coefficient of 8.9%. This work opens a new avenue to fabricate organic single-crystal wafers for high-performance organic electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Smart DNA&#8208;Based Nanosystem Containing Ribosome&#8208;Regulating&#160;siRNA for Enhanced mRNA Transfection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart DNA&#8208;based nanosystem with an siRNA&#8208;mediated regulation pathway that upregulates mRNA translation and enhances mRNA transfection is reported. The DNA&#8208;based nanosystem disassembles and releases siRNA and mRNA in response to intracellular stimuli and promotes ribosome biogenesis through intracellular glutathione depletion, which facilitates the mRNA delivery in hard&#8208;to&#8208;transfect cells both in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Messenger RNA (mRNA) transfection is the prerequisite for the application of mRNA&#8208;based therapeutics. In hard&#8208;to&#8208;transfect cells, such as macrophages, the effective transfection of mRNA remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, a smart DNA&#8208;based nanosystem is reported containing ribosome biogenesis&#8208;promoting siRNA, realizing efficient mRNA transfection in macrophages. Four monomers are copolymerized to form a nanoframework (NF), including N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) as the skeleton and acrydite&#8208;DNA as the initiator to trigger the cascade assembly of DNA hairpins (H1&#8208;polyT and H2&#8208;siRNA). By virtue of the phase transition characteristic of polymeric NIPAM, below the lower critical solution temperature (LCST, &#8776;34&#160;&#176;C), the NF swells to expose polyT sequences to hybridize with the polyA tail of mRNA. Above the LCST, the NF deswells to encapsulate mRNA. The disulfide bond in the NF responds to glutathione, triggering the disassembly of the nanosystem; the siRNA and mRNA are released in response to triphosadenine and RNase H. The siRNA down&#8208;regulates the expression of heat shock protein 27, which up&#8208;regulates the expression of phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6. The nanosystem shows satisfactory mRNA transfection and translation efficiency in a mouse model. It is envisioned that the DNA&#8208;based nanosystem will provide a promising carrier to deliver mRNA in hard&#8208;to&#8208;transfect cells and promote the development of mRNA&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>Boosting the Performance of Organic Photodetectors with a Solution&#8208;Processed Integration Circuit toward Ubiquitous Health Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processed integration circuit consisting of an organic field&#8208;effect transistor with an ultrahigh signal amplification efficiency, an organic photoconductor, and an organic resistor is proposed to dramatically boost the photoresponse signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, enabling the accurate extraction of physiological information from the photoplethysmographic waveforms, which can promote the development of ubiquitous health monitoring.








Abstract
Organic photodetectors, as an emerging wearable photoplethysmographic (PPG) technology, offer exciting opportunities for next&#8208;generation photonic healthcare electronics. However, the mutual restraints among photoresponse, structure complexity, and fabrication cost have intrinsically limited the development of organic photodetectors for ubiquitous health monitoring in daily activities. Here, an effective route to dramatically boost the performance of organic photodetectors with a solution&#8208;processed integration circuit for health monitoring application is reported. Through creating an ideal metal&#8211;semiconductor junction interface that minimizes the trap states within the device, solution&#8208;printed organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) are achieved with an ultrahigh signal amplification efficiency of 37.1 S A&#8722;1, approaching the theoretical thermionic limit. Consequently, monolithic integration of the OFET with an organic photoconductor enables the remarkable amplification of photoresponse signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio by more than four orders of magnitude from 5.5 to 4.6 &#215; 105, which is able to meet the demand for accurately extracting physiological information from the PPG waveforms. This work offers an effective and versatile approach to greatly enhance the photodetector performance, promising to revolutionize health monitoring technologies.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Meet Polymers: From Synthesis Strategies to Healthcare Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybridizing metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with flexible polymers leads to unique properties wherein the incorporation of suitable polymers enhances the MOF performance. This review highlights the recent advances in the preparation of MOF&#8211;polymer nanomaterials, and discusses their applications in anticancer therapy, anti&#8208;bacteria treatment, imaging, protection from oxidative stress and inflammation, and environmental remediation. Insights from the current research and design principles are revealed for addressing future challenges.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been at the forefront of nanotechnological research for the past decade owing to their high porosity, high surface area, diverse configurations, and controllable chemical structures. They are a rapidly developing class of nanomaterials that are predominantly applied in batteries, supercapacitors, electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, sensors, drug delivery, gas separation, adsorption, and storage. However, the limited functions and unsatisfactory performance of MOFs resulting from their low chemical and mechanical stability hamper further development. Hybridizing MOFs with polymers is an excellent solution to these problems, because polymers&#8212;which are soft, flexible, malleable, and processable&#8212;can induce unique properties in the hybrids based on those of the two disparate components while retaining their individuality. This review highlights recent advances in the preparation of MOF&#8211;polymer nanomaterials. Furthermore, several applications wherein the incorporation of polymers enhances the MOF performance are discussed, such as anticancer therapy, bacterial elimination, imaging, therapeutics, protection from oxidative stress and inflammation, and environmental remediation. Finally, insights from the focus of existing research and design principles for mitigating future challenges are presented.

         <title>Manipulation of Charge Dynamics for Efficient and Bright Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Chiral Ligands</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By manipulating the charge dynamics through a novel chiral organic cation passivator and a ladder&#8208;like energy architecture, blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) exhibit a maximum external quantum efficiency of 13.15%, a luminance of 8170&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, and a record power efficiency of 18.42&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1 with stable emissions, rendering that the performance is among the best blue PeLEDs.








Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) emerge as a promising class of optoelectronic devices for next&#8208;generation displays and lighting technology. However, the performance of blue PeLEDs lags far behind that of their green and red counterparts, including the unachieved trade&#8208;off between high efficiency and high luminance, severe efficiency roll&#8208;off, and unsatisfactory power efficiency. Here, a multi&#8208;functional chiral ligand of L&#8208;phenylalanine methyl ester hydrochloride is strategically introduced into quasi&#8208;2D perovskites, which can effectively passivate defects, modulate the phase distribution, improve photoluminescence quantum yield, guarantee high&#8208;quality film morphology, and enhance charge transport. Furthermore, ladder&#8208;like hole transport layers are established, boosting charge injection and balance. The resultant sky&#8208;blue PeLEDs (the photoluminescence peak is 493&#160;nm and the electroluminescence peak is 497&#160;nm) exhibit an external quantum efficiency of 12.43% at 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 and a record power efficiency of 18.42&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1, rendering that the performance is among the best blue PeLEDs.

         <title>Porosity as a Design Element for Developing Catalytic Molecular Materials for Electrochemical and Photochemical Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular materials catalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), that feature permanent porosity as a design feature, are showcased. Selected examples provide insights into how different approaches to this overall design strategy can augment their electrocatalytic and/or photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity.








Abstract
The catalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) using sustainable energy inputs is a promising strategy for upcycling of atmospheric carbon into value&#8208;added chemical products. This goal has inspired the development of catalysts for selective and efficient CO2 conversion using electrochemical and photochemical methods. Among the diverse array of catalyst systems designed for this purpose, 2D and 3D platforms that feature porosity offer the potential to combine carbon capture and conversion.

         <title>Biocatalytic Foams from Microdroplet&#8208;Formulated Self&#8208;Assembling Enzymes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocatalytically active enzyme foams produced via microdroplet foaming of self&#8208;assembling enzymes exhibit a regular hexagonal honeycomb network, the mechanical stability of which increases by drying to achieve high biocatalytic performance in continuous flow processes.








Abstract
Industrial biocatalysis plays an important role in the development of a sustainable economy, as enzymes can be used to synthesize an enormous range of complex molecules under environmentally friendly conditions. To further develop the field, intensive research is being conducted on process technologies for continuous flow biocatalysis in order to immobilize large quantities of enzyme biocatalysts in microstructured flow reactors under conditions that are as gentle as possible in order to realize efficient material conversions. Here, monodisperse foams consisting almost entirely of enzymes covalently linked via SpyCatcher/SpyTag conjugation are reported. The biocatalytic foams are readily available from recombinant enzymes via microfluidic air&#8208;in&#8208;water droplet formation, can be directly integrated into microreactors, and can be used for biocatalytic conversions after drying. Reactors prepared by this method show surprisingly high stability and biocatalytic activity. The physicochemical characterization of the new materials is described and exemplary applications in biocatalysis are shown using two&#8208;enzyme cascades for the stereoselective synthesis of chiral alcohols and the rare sugar tagatose.

         <title>PdNi Biatomic Clusters from Metallene Unlock Record&#8208;Low Onset Dehydrogenation Temperature for Bulk&#8208;MgH2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unprecedented initial dehydrogenation temperature of bulk MgH2&#8208;PdNi is 422 K, which is lower than the most bulk MgH2&#8208;based composites. PdNi alloy clusters with suitable d&#8208;band centers are used as the main active sites, which together with Pd/Ni pure phase clusters and Pd/Ni single atoms in situ enhance the desorption/absorption process.








Abstract
Hydrogen storage has long been a priority on the renewable energy research agenda. Due to its high volumetric and gravimetric hydrogen density, MgH2 is a desirable candidate for solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage. However, its practical use is constrained by high thermal stability and sluggish kinetics. Here, PdNi bilayer metallenes are reported as catalysts for hydrogen storage of bulk&#8208;MgH2 near ambient temperature. Unprecedented 422 K beginning dehydrogenation temperature and up to 6.36&#160;wt.% reliable hydrogen storage capacity are achieved. Fast hydrogen desorption is also provided by the system (5.49&#160;wt.% in 1&#160;h, 523 K). The in situ generated PdNi alloy clusters with suitable d&#8208;band centers are identified as the main active sites during the de/re&#8208;hydrogenation process by aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy and theoretical simulations, while other active species including Pd/Ni pure phase clusters and Pd/Ni single atoms obtained via metallene ball milling, also enhance the reaction. These findings present fundamental insights into active species identification and rational design of highly efficient hydrogen storage materials.

         <title>Bilayer Zwitterionic Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Selective All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Superionic Conduction in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte featuring bilayer zwitterionic nanochannels (BZN) is constructed by grafting soft multicationic oligomers (MCOs) onto a rigid anionic MOF framework. The unique BZN can serve as ion&#8208;selectivity gates, specifically promoting the transport of Li+ and rendering stable operation of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density solid&#8208;state full cells.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) hold immense potential for improved energy density and safety compared to traditional batteries. However, existing solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) face challenges in meeting the complex operational requirements of SSBs. This study&#160;introduces a novel approach to address this issue by developing a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) with customized bilayer zwitterionic nanochannels (MOF&#8208;BZN) as high&#8208;performance SSEs. The BZN consist of a rigid anionic MOF channel with chemically grafted soft multicationic oligomers (MCOs) on the pore wall. This design enables selective superionic conduction, with MCOs restricting the movement of anions while coulombic interaction between MCOs and anionic framework promoting the dissociation of Li+. MOF&#8208;BZN exhibits remarkable Li+ conductivity (8.76 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1), high Li+ transference number (0.75), and a wide electrochemical window of up to 4.9&#160;V at 30 &#176;C. Ultimately, the SSB utilizing flame retarded MOF&#8208;BZN achieves an impressive specific energy of 419.6&#160;Wh kganode+cathode+electrolyte&#8722;1 under constrained conditions of high cathode loading (20.1&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) and limited lithium metal source. The constructed bilayer zwitterionic MOFs present a pioneering strategy for developing advanced SSEs for highly efficient SSBs.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Interface Modulation with Covalent Organic Framework Enables Efficient and Durable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;interface modulation strategy is demonstrated using functional covalent organic frameworks to fabricate the high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells; a champion efficiency of 24.26% is obtained together with enhanced long&#8208;term stability due to released tensile stress, reduced trap state density, as well as enhanced resistance of humidity and ultraviolet irradiation.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;interface modulation including buried interface as well as the top surface has recently been proven to be crucial for obtaining high photovoltaic performance in lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, for the first time, the strategy of using functional covalent organic frameworks (COFs), namely HS&#8208;COFs for dual&#8208;interface modulation, is reported to further understand its intrinsic mechanisms in optimizing the bottom and top surfaces. Specifically, the buried HS&#8208;COFs layer can enhance the resistance against ultraviolet radiation, and more importantly, release the tensile strain, which is beneficial for enhancing device stability and improving the order of perovskite crystal growth. Furthermore, the detailed characterization results reveal that the HS&#8208;COFs on the top surface can effectively passivate the surface defects and suppress non&#8208;radiation recombination, as well as optimize the crystallization and growth of the perovskite film. Benefiting from the synergistic effects, the dual&#8208;interface modified devices deliver champion efficiencies of 24.26% and 21.30% for 0.0725 cm2 and 1 cm2&#8208;sized devices, respectively. Moreover, they retain 88% and 84% of their initial efficiencies after aging for 2000 h under the ambient conditions (25&#160;&#176;C, relative humidity: 35&#8211;45%) and a nitrogen atmosphere with heating at 65&#160;&#176;C, respectively.

Excessive inflammatory reactions caused by uric acid deposition are the key factor leading to gout. However, clinical medications cannot simultaneously remove uric acid and eliminate inflammation. An M2 macrophage&#8208;erythrocyte hybrid membrane&#8208;camouflaged biomimetic nanosized liposome is engineered to deliver targeted self&#8208;cascading bienzymes and an immunomodulator to reprogram the inflammatory microenvironment for enhanced enzyme&#8208;thermo&#8208;immunotherapy.








Abstract
Excessive inflammatory reactions caused by uric acid deposition are the key factor leading to gout. However, clinical medications cannot simultaneously remove uric acid and eliminate inflammation. An M2 macrophage&#8208;erythrocyte hybrid membrane&#8208;camouflaged biomimetic nanosized liposome (USM[H]L) is engineered to deliver targeted self&#8208;cascading bienzymes and immunomodulators to reprogram the inflammatory microenvironment in gouty rats. The cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coating endow nanosomes with good immune escape and lysosomal escape to achieve long circulation time and intracellular retention times. After being uptaken by inflammatory cells, synergistic enzyme&#8208;thermo&#8208;immunotherapies are achieved: uricase and nanozyme degraded uric acid and hydrogen peroxide, respectively; bienzymes improved the catalytic abilities of each other; nanozyme produced photothermal effects; and methotrexate has immunomodulatory and anti&#8208;inflammatory effects. The uric acid levels markedly decrease, and ankle swelling and claw curling are effectively alleviated. The levels of inflammatory cytokines and ROS decrease, while the anti&#8208;inflammatory cytokine levels increase. Proinflammatory M1 macrophages are reprogrammed to the anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 phenotype. Notably, the IgG and IgM levels in USM[H]L&#8208;treated rats decrease substantially, while uricase&#8208;treated rats show high immunogenicity. Proteomic analysis show that there are 898 downregulated and 725 upregulated differentially expressed proteins in USM[H]L&#8208;treated rats. The protein&#8208;protein interaction network indicates that the signaling pathways include the spliceosome, ribosome, purine metabolism, etc.

         <title>d&#8208;Orbital Electron Delocalization Realized by Axial Fe4C Atomic Clusters Delivers High&#8208;Performance Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C Catalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new deeper viewpoint for how to improve the intrinsic catalytic activity of single&#8208;atom catalysts is shown in this work. Axial Fe4C atomic clusters can provide strong electronic perturbation to Fe&#8211;N4 active centers, leading to the d&#8208;orbital electron delocalization of Fe and forming the Fe&#8211;pyrrolic N4 bond with high charge distribution compared with Fe and Fe3C atomic clusters. Moreover, unlike the previous studies, this research focuses more on the electron distribution of Fe&#8211;N structure, rather than Fe electronic structures.








Abstract
Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction&#160;(ORR) has been considered as the most promising nonprecious metal catalyst due to its comparable catalytic performance to Pt in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). The active centers of Fe&#8211;pyrrolic N4 have been proven to be extremely active for ORR. However, forming a stable Fe&#8211;pyrrolic N4 structure is a huge challenge. Here, a Cyan&#8208;Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst with Fe&#8211;pyrrolic N4 as the intrinsic active center is constructed with the help of axial Fe4C atomic clusters, which shows a half&#8208;wave potential of up to 0.836&#160;V (vs. RHE) in the acid environment. More remarkably, it delivers a high power density of 870 and 478&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 at 1.0&#160;bar in H2&#8211;O2 and H2&#8211;Air fuel cells, respectively. According to theoretical calculation and in situ spectroscopy, the axial Fe4C can provide strong electronic perturbation to Fe&#8211;N4 active centers, leading to the d&#8208;orbital electron delocalization of Fe and forming the Fe&#8211;pyrrolic N4 bond with high charge distribution, which stabilizes the Fe&#8211;pyrrolic N4 structure and optimizes the OH* adsorption during the catalytic process. This work proposes a new strategy to adjust the electronic structure of single&#8208;atom catalysts based on the strong interaction between single atoms and atomic clusters.

         <title>Managing Interfacial Charged Defects with Multiple Active Sited Macrocyclic Valinomycin for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The unavoidably positively and negatively charged defects at the interface between perovskite and electron transport layer (ETL) often lead to severe surface recombination and unfavorable energy level alignment in inverted perovskite solar cells (PerSCs). Inserting interlayers at this interface is an effective approach to eliminate charged defects. Herein, the macrocyclic molecule valinomycin (VM) with multiple active sites of &#8211;C = O, &#8211;NH, and &#8211;O&#8211; is employed as an interlayer at the perovskite/ETL contact to simultaneously eliminate positively and negatively charged defects. Combined with a series of theoretical calculations and experimental analyzes, we demonstrate that the &#8211;C = O and &#8211;O&#8211; groups in VM can immobilize the uncoordinated Pb2+ to manage the positively charged defect, and the formation of N&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;I hydrogen bonding could recompense the formamidine vacancies to eliminate the negatively charged defect. Besides, the VM interlayer induces a favorable downshift band bending at the perovskite/ETL interface, facilitating charge separation and boosting charge transfer. Thanks to the reduced charged defects and favorable energy level alignment, the fabricated inverted PerSC delivers an outstanding power conversion efficiency of 24.06% with excellent long&#8208;term ambient and thermal stability. This work demonstrates that managing charged defects via multiple functional groups and simultaneously regulating energy level alignment is a reliable strategy to boost the performance of PerSCs.

         <title>Negative Photo&#8208;Response Switching via Electron&#8208;Hole Recombination at The Type Iii Junction of MoTe2 Channel/SnS2 Top Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Extensive study on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) van der Waals heterojunctions has primarily focused on PN diodes for fast&#8208;switching photo&#8208;detection, while achieving the same from 2D channel phototransistors has been rare despite their other advantages. Here, we have designed a high&#8208;speed phototransistor featuring a type III junction between p&#8208;MoTe2 channel and n&#8208;SnS2 top layer. Our photo&#8208;detecting device operates with a basis of negative photo&#8208;response (NPR), which originates from the recombination of photo&#8208;excited electrons in n&#8208;SnS2 and accumulated holes in the p&#8208;MoTe2 channel. For the NPR to occur, high&#8208;energy photons capable of exciting SnS2 (band gap &#8764;2.2&#160;eV) have been found to be effective, because lower&#8208;energy photons simply penetrate the SnS2 top layer only to excite MoTe2, leading to normal positive photo&#8208;response (PPR) which is known to be slow due to the photo&#8208;gating effects. Our NPR transistor showcases 0.5&#160;ms&#8208;fast photo&#8208;responses and a high responsivity over 5000 A W&#8722;1. More essentially, such carrier recombination mechanism is clarified with three experimental evidences. The phototransistor is finally modified with Au contact on n&#8208;SnS2, to be a more practical device displaying voltage output. Three different photo&#8208;logic states under blue, near infra&#8208;red (NIR), and blue&#8208;NIR mixed photons are demonstrated using the voltage signals.

         <title>Humidity/Oxygen&#8208; Insensitive Organic Synaptic Transistors Based on Optical Radical Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
For most organic synaptic transistors based on the charge trapping effect, different atmosphere conditions would lead to significantly different device performance. Some devices even lost the synaptic responses under the vacuum or inert atmosphere. The stable device performance of these organic synaptic transistors under varied working environments with different humidity and oxygen level can be a challenge. Herein, we report a moisture&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;insensitive organic synaptic device based on the organic semiconductor and photoinitiator molecules. Unlike the widely reported charge trapping effect, we utilize the photo&#8208;induced free radical to realize the photo&#8208;synaptic performance. The resulting synaptic transistor displays typical excitatory post&#8208;synaptic current, paired&#8208;pulse facilitation, learning, and forgetting behaviors. Furthermore, the device exhibits decent and stable photo&#8208;synaptic performances under high humidity and vacuum conditions. This type of organic synaptic device also demonstrates high potential in ultraviolet B perception based on its environmental stability and broad ultraviolet detection capability. Finally, the contrast&#8208;enhanced capability of the device has been successfully validated by the single&#8208;layer&#8208;perceptron/double&#8208;layer network based Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology pattern recognition. This work could have important implications for the development of next&#8208;generation environment&#8208;stable organic synaptic devices and systems.

         <title>Achieving Superior Tensile Performance in Individual Metal&#8722;Organic Framework Crystals</title>

         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;crystal tetraphenylporphyrin&#8208;type metal&#8208;organic framework nanobelts are found to exhibit unprecedented mechanical properties beyond theoretical limits and the origins of these mechanical properties are revealed by simulations.








Abstract
Rapid advances in the engineering application prospects of metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF) materials necessitate an urgent in&#8208;depth understanding of their mechanical properties. This work demonstrates unprecedented recoverable elastic deformation of Ni&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrins (Ni&#8208;TCPP) MOF nanobelts with a tensile strain as high as 14%, and a projected yield strength&#8208;to&#8208;Young's modulus ratio exceeding the theoretical limit (&#8776;10%) for crystalline materials. Based on first&#8208;principles simulations, the observed behavior of MOF crystal can be attributed to the mechanical deformation induced conformation transition and the formation of helical configuration of dislocations under high stresses, arising from their organic ligand building blocks in the crystal structures. The investigations of the mechanical properties along with electromechanical properties demonstrate that MOF materials have exciting application potential for biomechanics integrated systems, flexible electronics, and nanoelectromechanical devices.

         <title>Microscale Imaging of Thermal Conductivity Suppression at Grain Boundaries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermal conductivity imaging via frequency&#8208;domain thermoreflectance enables the detection of localized microscale suppression in thermal conductivity at the grain boundaries of thermoelectric SnTe. By employing a Gibbs excess approach, a thermal boundary resistance is extracted from the images, establishing a correlation between misorientation angle and thermal resistance. These findings demonstrate the capability of thermal imaging in extracting structure&#8211;property relationships.








Abstract
Grain&#8208;boundary engineering is an effective strategy to tune the thermal conductivity of materials, leading to improved performance in thermoelectric, thermal&#8208;barrier coatings, and thermal management applications. Despite the central importance to thermal transport, a clear understanding of how grain boundaries modulate the microscale heat flow is missing, owing to the scarcity of local investigations. Here, thermal imaging of individual grain boundaries is demonstrated in thermoelectric SnTe via spatially resolved frequency&#8208;domain thermoreflectance. Measurements with microscale resolution reveal local suppressions in thermal conductivity at grain boundaries. Also, the grain&#8208;boundary thermal resistance &#8211; extracted by employing a Gibbs excess approach &#8211; is found to be correlated with the grain&#8208;boundary misorientation angle. Extracting thermal properties, including thermal boundary resistances, from microscale imaging can provide comprehensive understanding of how microstructure affects heat transport, crucially impacting the materials design of high&#8208;performance thermal&#8208;management and energy&#8208;conversion devices.

         <title>Inter&#8208;Shell Sliding in Individual Few&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes for Flexible Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Few&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (FWCNT) is composed of a few coaxial shells of CNTs with different diameters. The shells in one tube can slide relatively to each other under external forces, potentially leading to regulated electrical properties, which has never been explored due to experimental difficulties. In this work, w e studied the electromechanical response induced by inter&#8208;shell sliding of individual CNTs and revealed the linear electrical current variation for the first time. Based on centimeter&#8208;long FWCNTs grown through chemical vapor deposition, controllable and reversible inter&#8208;shell sliding w as realized while simultaneously recording the electrical current. Reversible and linear current variation with inter&#8208;shell sliding w as observed, which is in consistent with o ur proposed inter&#8208;shell tunneling model. Further, w e developed a silk fibroin&#8208;assisted transfer technique for long CNTs and realized the fabrication of FWCNT&#8208;based flexible devices. Tensile stress can be applied on the FWCNTs@silk film encapsulated in elastic silicone to induce inter&#8208;shell sliding and thus controlled electrical current, which w as demonstrated to serve as a new human&#8208;machine interface with high reliability. Besides, w e foresee that the electromechanical behaviors induced by inter&#8208;layer sliding in 1D nanotubes may also be extended to 2D layered materials, shedding new light on the fabrication of novel electronics.

         <title>Salt&#8208;Induced High&#8208;Density Vacancy&#8208;Rich Two&#8208;Dimensional MoS2&#160;for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Emerging non&#8208;noble metal two&#8208;dimensional catalysts, such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), hold great promise in hydrogen evolution reactions. To enhance the intrinsically low activity of the basal plane structures of MoS2, various phase, strain and defect engineering approaches have been proposed. Sulfur vacancy is recognized as a key type of defect that impacts the catalytic performance. Unfortunately, the method of introducing sulfur vacancies is limited and requires costly post&#8208;treatment processes. Here, we demonstrate a novel salt&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method for synthesizing ultra&#8208;high&#8208;density vacancy&#8208;rich 2H&#8208;MoS2, with a controllable sulfur vacancy density of up to 3.35 &#215; 1014 cm&#8722;2. Our approach involves pre&#8208;sprayed potassium chloride (KCl) promoter on the growth substrate. The generation of such defects is closely related to ion adsorption in the growth process, the unstable MoS2&#8208;K&#8208;H2O triggers the formation of sulfur vacancy during the subsequent transfer process. Our novel approach to directly implant high density S vacancies in MoS2 during growth is more controllable and nondestructive when compared to the traditional post&#8208;treatment methods. The vacancy&#8208;rich monolayer MoS2 exhibits exceptional catalytic activity based on the microcell measurements, with an overpotential of &#8764; 158.8&#160;mV (100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and a Tafel slope of 54.3&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 in 0.5&#160;M H2SO4 electrolyte. Our results indicate a promising opportunity for modulating pure sulfur vacancy defects in MoS2 using salt&#8208;assisted CVD growth. This approach represents a significant leap towards achieving better control over the catalytic performances of 2D materials.

         <title>Liquid Crystals Doped with Chiral Fluorescent Polymer: Multi&#8208;Color Circularly Polarized Fluorescence and Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence with High Dissymmetry Factor and Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Application</title>

Abstract
Chiral nematic liquid crystals (N*&#8208;LCs) can tremendously amplify circular polarized luminescence (CPL) signals. Doped emissive N*&#8208;LCs have been substantially explored. However, their CPL performances still need to be improved, majorly due to the unsatisfying helical twisting power (HTP) of commonly used chiral fluorescent dopants. Chiral fluorescent helical polymers (CFHPs) have outstanding optical activity and CPL performance. The present contribution reports the first success in constructing emissive N*&#8208;LCs by doping CFHP into nematic liquid crystals (5CB, N&#8208;LCs). The helical assembly structures of N*&#8208;LCs effectively amplify CPL signals of the CFHP. Owing to the high HTP of CFHP, selective reflection band of N*&#8208;LC can be adjusted to fully cover its emission band. A nearly pure CPL with dissymmetry factor (glum) up to &#8211;1.87 is realized at 9 wt% doping concentration. Taking advantage of selective reflection mechanism, multi&#8208;color CPL&#8208;active N*&#8208;LCs with high glum are fabricated via further adding achiral fluorophores. Also noticeably, circularly polarized room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (CPRTP) with glum up to &#8211;1.57 is achieved. Anti&#8208;counterfeiting application is demonstrated exploiting multi&#8208;mode optical characteristics of the created N*&#8208;LCs. The established strategy for constructing emissive N*&#8208;LCs provides a platform for future exploring CPL&#8208;active N*&#8208;LCs.

         <title>Amphiphilic Cobalt Phthalocyanine Boosts Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Due to the easy accessibility, chemical stability and structural tunability of macrocyclic skeleton, cobalt phthalocyanines immobilized on carbon supports offer an ideal research model for advanced electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (eCO2RR). Herein, for the first time, an amphiphilic cobalt phthalocyanine (TC&#8208;CoPc) is loaded on multiwalled carbon nanotubes to unveral the roles of hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties on catalytic efficiency. To our surprise, the resultant electrode exhibits FECO of 95% for CO2RR with TOF of 29.4 s&#8722;1 at the overpotential of 0.585&#160;V over long&#8208;term electrolysis in H&#8208;type cell. In membrane electrode assembly device (MEA), the boosted transport of water vapor to catalyst layer slows down carbonate crystallization and enhances the stability of the electrode with FECO value of &gt; 99% over 27 hours at &#8722;0.25 A, which represents the best selectivity and stability among reported molecular catalysts in MEA devices. The amphiphilic cobalt phthalocyanine, which decreases interfacial charge and mass transfer resistance and maintains effective contact between active sites and the electrolyte, highlights the exceptional CO2 conversion from molecular perspective.

         <title>Color&#8208;Tunable, Excitation&#8208;Dependent, and Water Stimulus&#8208;Responsive Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Cellulose for Versatile Applications</title>

Abstract
Smart&#8208;response materials with ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are highly desirable, but they have rarely been described, especially those originating from sustainable polymers. Herein, a variety of cellulose derivatives with 1,4 dihydropyridines (DHPs) rings were synthesized through the Hantzsch reaction, giving impressive RTP with a long lifetime of up to 1251 ms. Specifically, the introduction of acetoacetyl groups and DHPs rings promotes the spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) and intersystem crossing (ISC) process, and multiple interactions between cellulose induce clustering and inhibit the nonradiative transitions, boosting long&#8208;live RTP. Furthermore, the resulting transparent and flexible cellulose films also exhibit excitation&#8208;dependent and color&#8208;tunable afterglows by introducing different extended aromatic groups. More interestingly, the RTP performance of these films is sensitive to water and can be repeated in response to wet/dry stimuli. Inspired by these advantages, the RTP cellulose demonstrates advanced applications in information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. This work not only enriches the photophysical properties of cellulose but also provides a versatile platform for the development of sustainable afterglows.

         <title>Less&#8208;Suture Vascular Anastomosis: Development of Alternative Protocols with Multifunctional Self&#8208;Wrapping, Transparent, Adhesive, and Elastic Biomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adhesive, hemostatic, transparent, and elastic films are developed in this study to be used in &#8220;less&#8208;suture anastomosis&#8221; for blood vessels. It extensively decreases the number of sutures for vascular anastomosis and overall surgical time to a life&#8208;saving level in both normal and coagulopathy animal models.








Abstract
Blood vessel anastomosis by suture is a life&#8208;saving, yet time&#8208;consuming and labor&#8208;intensive operation. While suture&#8208;less alternatives utilizing clips or related devices are developed to address these shortcomings, suture anastomosis is still overwhelmingly used in most cases. In this study, practical &#8220;less&#8208;suture&#8221; strategies are proposed, rather than ideal &#8220;suture&#8208;less&#8221; methods, to reflect real&#8208;world clinical situations. In the case of rat artery (d = 0.64&#160;mm) anastomosis, the less&#8208;suture anastomosis involves the application of thin, adhesive, transparent, and self&#8208;wrapping films to the site. This surprisingly reduces the number of stitches required from ten (without films) to four (with films), saving 27&#160;min of operating time per vessel. Furthermore, the decreased number of stitches largely alleviates fibrosis&#8208;mediated wall&#8208;thickening. Thus, a less&#8208;suture strategy is particularly useful for anastomosis of multiple vessels in emergency conditions and small&#8208;diameter vessels.

         <title>2D Ferroionics: Conductive Switching Mechanisms and Transition Boundaries in Van der Waals Layered Material CuInP2S6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A full 2D van der Waals heterostructure ferroelectric semimetal junction is fabricated to unravel the conductive mechanism of CuInP2S6, and a detailed phase diagram of the competing mechanisms and transition boundaries with temperature and an external electric field is presented. Based on this understanding, an artificial synapse with automatic gain control is also demonstrated.








Abstract
The recently unfolded ferroionic phenomena in 2D van der Waals (vdW) copper&#8211;indium&#8211;thiophosphate (CuInP2S6 or CIPS) have received widespread interest as they allow for dynamic control of conductive switching properties, which are appealing in the paradigm&#8208;shift computing. The intricate couplings between ferroelectric polarization and ionic conduction in 2D vdW CIPS facilitate the manipulation and dynamic control of conductive behaviors. However, the complex interplays and underlying mechanisms are not yet fully explored and understood. Here, by investigating polarization switching and ionic conduction in the temperature and applied electric field domains, it is discovered that the conducting mechanisms of CIPS can be divided into four distinctive states (or modes) with transitional boundaries, depending on the dynamics of Cu ions in the material. Further, it demonstrates that dynamically&#8208;tunable synaptic responsive behavior can be well implemented by governing the working&#8208;state transition. This research provides an in&#8208;depth, quantitative understanding of the complex phenomena of conductive switching in 2D vdW CIPS with coexisting ferroelectric order and ionic disorder. The developed insights in this work lay the ground for implementing high&#8208;performance, function&#8208;enriched devices for information processing, data storage, and neuromorphic computing based on the 2D ferroionic material systems.

         <title>Ultrafast Subpicosecond Magnetization of a 2D Ferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first sub&#8208;ps (&#8776;600&#160;fs) magnetization process in a ferromagnetic quantum well is successfully demonstrated, which utilizes the high carrier coherency and a rapid photo&#8208;Demba field effect, using pump&#8208;and&#8208;probe measurements with an X&#8208;ray free&#8208;electron laser. This hopefully opens a new way to ultrafast magnetic storage and information processing.








Abstract
Strong spin&#8208;charge interactions in several ferromagnets are expected to lead to subpicosecond (sub&#8208;ps) magnetization of the magnetic materials through control of the carrier characteristics via electrical means, which is essential for ultrafast spin&#8208;based electronic devices. Thus far, ultrafast control of magnetization has been realized by optically pumping a large number of carriers into the d or f orbitals of a ferromagnet; however, it is extremely challenging to implement by electrical gating. This work demonstrates a new method for sub&#8208;ps magnetization manipulation called wavefunction engineering, in which only the spatial distribution (wavefunction) of s (or p) electrons is controlled and no change is required in the total carrier density. Using&#160;a ferromagnetic semiconductor (FMS) (In,Fe)As quantum well (QW), instant enhancement, as fast as 600&#160;fs, of the magnetization is observed upon irradiating a femtosecond (fs) laser pulse. Theoretical&#160;analysis shows that the instant enhancement of the magnetization is induced when the 2D electron wavefunctions (WFs) in the FMS QW are rapidly moved by a photo&#8208;Dember electric field formed by an asymmetric distribution of the photocarriers. Because this WF engineering method can be equivalently implemented by applying a gate electric field, these results open a new way to realize ultrafast magnetic storage and spin&#8208;based information processing in present electronic systems.

         <title>Ferroelectric Switching at Symmetry&#8208;Broken Interfaces by Local Control of Dislocations Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelectric stacking order domains are observed in marginally twisted WS2. Using a scanning tunnelling microscope, reversible, local control of the domain walls is demonstrated at room temperature, and their evolution is understood with a theoretical model.








Abstract
Semiconducting ferroelectric materials with low energy polarization switching offer a platform for next&#8208;generation electronics such as ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistors. Recently discovered interfacial ferroelectricity in bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenide films provides an opportunity to combine the potential of semiconducting ferroelectrics with the design flexibility of 2D material devices. Here, local control of ferroelectric domains in a marginally twisted WS2 bilayer is demonstrated with a scanning tunneling microscope at room temperature, and their observed reversible evolution is understood using a string&#8208;like model of the domain wall network (DWN). Two characteristic regimes of DWN evolution are identified: (i) elastic bending of partial screw dislocations separating smaller domains with twin stackings due to mutual sliding of monolayers at domain boundaries and (ii) merging of primary domain walls into perfect screw dislocations, which become the seeds for the recovery of the initial domain structure upon reversing electric field. These results open the possibility to achieve full control over atomically thin semiconducting ferroelectric domains using local electric fields, which is a critical step towards their technological use.

         <title>Recent Advances and Challenges of Colloidal Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes for Display Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To guide the pathway toward the commercialization of quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs), representative research trends, progress, and challenges of QLEDs in the categories of material synthesis, device engineering, and fabrication methods are reviewed to specify the current status and development direction. Furthermore, brief insights into the factors to be considered when realizing active matrix QLED displays are provided.








Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) exhibit tremendous potential in display technologies owing to their unique optical properties, such as size&#8208;tunable emission wavelength, narrow spectral linewidth, and near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield. Significant efforts in academia and industry have achieved dramatic improvements in the performance of quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) over the past decade, primarily owing to the development of high&#8208;quality QDs and optimized device architectures. Moreover, sophisticated patterning processes have also been developed for QDs, which is an essential technique for their commercialization. As a result of these achievements, some QD&#8208;based display technologies, such as QD enhancement films and QD&#8208;organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, have been successfully commercialized, confirming the superiority of QDs in display technologies. However, despite these developments, the commercialization of QLEDs is yet to reach a threshold, requiring a leap forward in addressing challenges and related problems. Thus, representative research trends, progress, and challenges of QLEDs in the categories of material synthesis, device engineering, and fabrication method to specify the current status and development direction are reviewed. Furthermore, brief insights into the factors to be considered when conducting research on single&#8208;device QLEDs are provided to realize active matrix displays. This review guides the way toward the commercialization of QLEDs.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Redox Bicatalysis Batteries for Energy Storage and Chemical Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review article, the fundamentals and design principles of metal&#8208;redox bicatalysis battery (constructed by redox bifunctional catalyst cathode and metal anode) are summarized and proposed, and the effects of device structure and compositions are deeply discussed for energy storage and chemical production, which provides a design paradigm for new types of energy storage and conversion devices.








Abstract
New types of electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices based on redox electrocatalytic reactions possess great potential in renewable energy to maximize energy utilization and balance environmental issues. The typical device is the metal&#8208;redox bicatalysis battery, where the cathode is redox bifunctional catalyst&#160;(named as redox bicatalyst) with gas, solid, liquid as active reactants while anode is metal, driven by cathodic redox electrocatalytic reactions during charge/discharge processes, which promotes the energy storage and chemical production. In this system, the metal anode, redox&#8208;bicatalyst cathode, electrolytes, and the redox electrochemical reactions can be modified and adjusted to achieve the optimal energy conversion and utilization. Therefore, the deep understanding of the electrochemical system is conducive to designing new devices to meet the demand among various applications, including energy storage and conversion. In this review, the authors clarify the fundamentals and design principles of the rechargeable/reversible metal&#8208;redox bicatalysis batteries and how each part affects the devices in energy conversion and chemical production. The authors summarize the electrocatalytic reduction/oxidation reactions, the reported systems relied on redox reactions, and the corresponding redox bicatalysts. Finally, a perspective of the key challenges and the possible new types of metal&#8208;redox bicatalysis batteries for efficient energy utilization and chemical production are given.

         <title>Bacteria&#8208;Derived Outer&#8208;Membrane Vesicles Hitchhike Neutrophils to Enhance Ischemic Stroke Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoplatform based on bacteria&#8208;derived outer&#8208;membrane vesicle is developed for enhanced brain delivery of pioglitazone. It can be specifically recognized by neutrophils during blood circulation, subsequently hitchhiking on the neutrophils to cross the blood&#8208;brain barrier. The transcription factors Pou2f1 and Nrf1 of oligodendrocytes are identified for the first time to be involved in neural repair.








Abstract
The treatment of reperfusion injury after ischemic stroke remains unsatisfactory since the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) prevents most neuroprotective agents from entering the brain. Here, a strategy is proposed based on bacteria&#8208;derived outer&#8208;membrane vesicle (OMV) hitchhiking on the neutrophils for enhanced brain delivery of pioglitazone (PGZ) to treat ischemic stroke. By encapsulating PGZ into OMV, the resulting OMV@PGZ nanoparticles inherit the functions associated with the bacterial outer membrane, making them ideal decoys for neutrophil uptake. The results show that OMV@PGZ simultaneously inhibits the activation of nucleotide oligomerization&#8208;like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3)&#160;inflammasomes and ferroptosis and reduces the reperfusion injury to exert a neuroprotective effect. Notably, the transcription factors Pou2f1 and Nrf1 of oligodendrocytes are identified for the first time to be involved in this process and promoted neural repair by single&#8208;nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA&#8208;seq).

         <title>Enhanced Hot&#8208;Phonon Bottleneck Effect on Slowing Hot Carrier Cooling in Metal Halide Perovskite Quantum Dots with Alloyed A&#8208;Site</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controversies regarding the origins and mechanisms of A&#8208;site cation&#8208;dependent hot carrier relaxation dynamics are resolved by comparing the photogenerated carrier dynamics of 6 kinds of pure and mixed A&#8208;site cation halide perovskite quantum dots (i.e., FAPbI3, MAPbI3, CsPbI3, FA0.5MA0.5PbI3, FA0.5Cs0.5PbI3, MA0.5Cs0.5PbI3 PQDs) at various excitation intensities.








Abstract
A deep understanding of the effect of the A&#8208;site cation cross&#8208;exchange on the hot&#8208;carrier relaxation dynamics in perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) has profound implications on the further development of disruptive photovoltaic technologies. In this study, the hot carrier cooling kinetics of pure FAPbI3 (FA+, CH(NH2)2+),&#160;MAPbI3 (MA+, CH3NH3++), CsPbI3 (Cs+, Cesium) and alloyed FA0.5MA0.5PbI3, FA0.5Cs0.5PbI3, and MA0.5Cs0.5PbI3 QDs are investigated using ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy. The lifetimes of the initial fast cooling stage (&lt;1&#160;ps) of all the organic cation&#8208;containing PQDs are shorter than those of the CsPbI3 QDs, as verified by the electron&#8208;phonon coupling strength extracted from the temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence spectra. The lifetimes of the slow cooling stage of the alloyed PQDs are longer under illumination greater than 1 sun, which is ascribed to the introduction of co&#8208;vibrational optical phonon modes in the alloyed PQDs. This facilitated efficient acoustic phonon upconversion and enhanced the hot&#8208;phonon bottleneck effect, as demonstrated by first&#8208;principles calculations.

         <title>In Situ Transmission Electron Microscopy for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the advances in the in situ transmission electron microscopy investigations on dynamic transformation and the corresponding morphological, structural, and chemical evolutions during the sodium storage process in the sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) including cathode materials, anode materials, and solid&#8208;electrolyte interface. This review aims to clarify the structure/composition&#8208;electrochemical performance relationship and to provide insights into the effective selection and rational design of advanced electrode materials for high&#8208;performance SIBs.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted tremendous attentions in recent years due to the abundance and wide distribution of Na resource on the earth. However, SIBs still face the critical issues of low energy density and unsatisfactory cyclic stability at present. The enhancement of electrochemical performance of SIBs depends on comprehensive and precise understanding of the underlying sodium storage mechanism. Although extensive transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations have been performed to reveal the sodium storage property and mechanism of SIBs, a dedicated review on the in situ TEM investigations of SIBs has not been reported. In this review, recent progress in the in situ TEM investigations on the morphological, structural, and chemical evolutions of cathode materials, anode materials, and solid&#8208;electrolyte interface during the sodium storage of SIBs is comprehensively summarized. The detailed relationship between structure/composition of electrode materials and electrochemical performance of SIBs has been clarified. This review aims to provide insights into the effective selection and rational design of advanced electrode materials for high&#8208;performance SIBs.

         <title>Suppression of Interphase Dissolution via Solvent Molecule Tuning for Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solvent molecule tuning is used to alter redox potentials of solvents or ion&#8208;solvent binding energy for high&#8208;voltage or low&#8208;temperature electrolyte. Herein, we propose an electrolyte design strategy that effectively suppresses solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) dissolution and passivates highly&#8208;reactive metallic Na anode via solvent molecule tuning. With rationally lengthened phosphate backbones with &#8211;CH2&#8211; units, the low&#8208;solvation tris(2&#8208;ethylhexyl) phosphate (TOP) molecule effectively weakens the solvation ability of carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes, reduces the free solvent ratio and enables an anion&#8208;enriched primary Na+ ion solvation sheath. The decreased free solvent and compact lower&#8208;solubility interphase established in this electrolyte prevent electrodes from the continuous SEI dissolution and parasitic reactions at both room temperature (RT) and high temperature (HT). As a result, the Na/Na3V2(PO4)3 cell with the new electrolyte achieves impressive cycling stability of 95.7% capacity retention after 1800 cycles at 25 &#176;C, and 62.1% capacity retention after 700 cycles at 60 &#176;C. Moreover, TOP molecule not only maintains the nonflammable feature of phosphate but also attains a higher thermal stability, which endows the electrolyte with high safety and thermal stability. Our design concept for electrolytes offers a promising path to long&#8208;cycling and high safe sodium metal batteries.

         <title>Cooperative Rheological State&#8208;Switching of Enzymatically&#8208;Driven Composites of Circular Dna And Dextran</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polymer topology, which plays a principal role in the rheology of polymeric fluids, and non&#8208;equilibrium materials, which exhibit time&#8208;varying rheological properties, are topics of intense investigation. Here, we push composites of circular DNA and dextran out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium via enzymatic digestion of DNA rings to linear fragments. Our time&#8208;resolved rheology measurements reveal discrete state&#8208;switching, with composites undergoing abrupt transitions between dissipative and elastic&#8208;like states. The gating time and lifetime of the elastic&#8208;like states, and the magnitude and sharpness of the transitions, are surprisingly decorrelated from digestion rates and non&#8208;monotonically depend on the DNA fraction. We model our results using sigmoidal two&#8208;state functions to show that bulk state&#8208;switching can arise from continuous molecular&#8208;level activity due to the necessity for cooperative percolation of entanglements to support macroscopic stresses. Our platform, coupling the tunability of topological composites with the power of enzymatic reactions, may be leveraged for diverse material applications from wound&#8208;healing to self&#8208;repairing infrastructure.

         <title>Unraveling The Coupling Effect Between Cathode And Anode Towards Practical Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The localized reaction heterogeneity of sulfur cathode and uneven Li deposition on Li anode are intractable issues for lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries under practical operations. Despite impressive progress in separately optimizing sulfur cathode or Li anode, it still lacks a comprehensive understanding of the highly coupled relationship between cathode and anode. Here, inspired by the Butler&#8208;Volmer equation, we identify a binary descriptor (IBD) assisting the rational structural design of sulfur cathode by simultaneously considering the mass transport index (Imass) and the charge transfer index (Icharge), and subsequently establish the relationship between IBD and the morphological evolution of Li anode. Guided by the IBD, we report a scalable electrode providing interpenetrated flow channels for efficient mass/charge transfer, full utilization of active sulfur, and mechanically elastic support for aggressive electrochemical reactions under practical conditions. These characteristics induce a homogenous distribution of local current densities and reduced reaction heterogeneity on both sides of the cathode and anode, which is confirmed by operando regional stress monitoring in pouch cells. Impressive energy density of 318&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 473&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 in an Ah&#8208;level pouch cell can be achieved by our design concept. This work offers a promising paradigm for unlocking the interaction between cathode and anode and designing high&#8208;energy practical Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Multifunctional Intelligent Wearable Devices Using Logical Circuits of Monolithic Gold Nanowires</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Although multifunctional wearable devices have been widely investigated for healthcare systems, augmented/virtual realities and telemedicines, there are few reports on multiple signal monitoring and logical signal processing by using one single nanomaterial without additional algorithms or rigid application&#8208;specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips. Here, we develop multifunctional intelligent wearable devices using monolithically patterned gold nanowires for both signal monitoring and processing. Gold bulk and hollow nanowires show distinctive electrical properties with high chemical stability and high stretchability. In accordance, the monolithically patterned gold nanowires can be used to fabricate the robust interfaces, programmable sensors, on&#8208;demand heating systems and strain&#8208;gated logical circuits. The stretchable sensors show high sensitivity for strain and temperature changes on the skin. Furthermore, the micro&#8208;wrinkle structures of gold nanowires exhibit the negative gauge factor, which can be used for strain&#8208;gated logical circuits. Taken together, this multifunctional intelligent wearable device would be harnessed as a promising platform for futuristic electronic and biomedical applications.

         <title>Embedding Living Cells with a Mechanically Reinforced and Functionally Programmable Hydrogel Fiber Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Living materials represent a new frontier in functional material design, integrating the synthetic biology tools to endow materials with programmable, dynamic and life&#8208;like characteristics. However, a major challenge in creating living materials is balancing the tradeoff between structural stability, mechanical performance, and functional programmability. To address this challenge, we propose a sheath&#8208;core living hydrogel fiber platform that synergistically integrates living bacteria with hydrogel fibers to achieve both functional diversity and structural and mechanical robustness. In the design, microfluidic spinning was used to produce hydrogel fiber, which offers advantages in both structural and functional designability due to their hierarchical porous architectures that can be tailored and their mechanical performance that can be enhanced through a variety of post&#8208;processing approaches. By introducing living bacteria, we endowed the platform with programmable functionality and life&#8208;like capabilities. This work reconstructed the genetic circuits of living bacteria to express chromoproteins and fluorescent proteins as two prototypes that enabled the coloration of living fibers and sensing water pollutants by monitoring the amount of fluorescent protein expressed. Altogether, this study established a structure&#8208;property&#8208;function optimized living hydrogel fiber platform, providing a new tool for accelerating the practical applications of the emerging living material system.

This work reconstructed the genetic circuits of living bacteria to express chromoproteins and fluorescent proteins as two prototypes that enabled the coloration of living fibers and sensing water pollutants by monitoring the amount of fluorescent protein expressed. Altogether, this study established a structure-property-function optimized living hydrogel fiber platform, providing a new tool for accelerating the practical applications of the emerging living material system.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Permittivity&#8208;Based Microparticle Classification by the Integration of Impedance Cytometry and Microwave Resonators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Permittivity of microscopic particles can be used as a classification parameter for applications in materials and environmental sciences. However, directly measuring the permittivity of individual microparticles has proven to be challenging due to the convoluting effect of particle size on capacitive signals. To overcome this challenge, we built a sensing platform to independently obtain both the geometric and electric size of a particle, by combining impedance cytometry and microwave resonant sensing in a microfluidic chip. This way the microwave signal, which contains both permittivity and size effects, can be normalized by the size information provided by impedance cytometry to yield an intensive parameter that depends only on permittivity. The technique allowed us to differentiate between polystyrene and soda lime glass microparticles &#8212;below 22 microns in diameter&#8212; with more than 94% accuracy, despite their similar sizes and electrical characteristics. Furthermore, we show that the same technique can be used to differentiate between normal healthy cells and fixed cells of the same geometric size. The technique offers a potential route for targeted applications such as environmental monitoring of microplastic pollution or quality control in pharmaceutical industry.

         <title>Topological Flat Bands in Two&#8208;Dimensional Breathing&#8208;Kagome Lattice Nb3TeCl7</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Flat bands (FBs) can appear in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) geometrically frustrated systems caused by quantum destructive interference (QDI). However, the scarcity of pure 2D frustrated crystal structures in natural materials makes FBs hard to be identified, let alone modulate FBs relating to electronic properties. Here, the experimental evidence of the complete electronic QDI induced FB contributed by the 2D breathing&#8208;kagome layers of Nb atoms in Nb3TeCl7 (NTC) is reported. An identical chemical state and 2D localization characteristics of the Nb breathing&#8208;kagome layers are experimentally confirmed, based on which NTC is demonstrated to be a superior concrete candidate for the breathing&#8208;kagome tight&#8208;binding model. Furthermore, it theoretically establishes the tunable roles of the on&#8208;site energy over Nb sites on bandwidth, energy position, and topology of FBs in NTC. This work opens an avenue to manipulate FBs characteristics in these 4d transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based breathing&#8208;kagome materials.

         <title>Spatial Position Regulation of Cu Single Atom Site Realizes Efficient Nanozyme Photocatalytic Bactericidal Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Recently, single&#8208;atom nanozymes have made significant progress in the fields of sterilization and treatment, but their catalytic performance as substitutes for natural enzymes and drugs are far from satisfactory. Here, we report a method to improve enzyme activity by adjusting the spatial position of a single&#8208;atom site on the nanoplatforms. We synthesized two types of Cu single atom site nanozymes in the interlayer (CuL/PHI) and in&#8208;plane (CuP/PHI) of poly (heptazine imide) (PHI) through different synthesis pathways. Experimental and theoretical analysis indicates that the interlayer position of PHI can effectively adjust the coordination number, coordination bond length, and electronic structure of Cu single atoms compared to the in&#8208;plane position, thereby promoting photoinduced electron migration and O2 activation, enabling effective generate reactive oxygen species. Under visible light irradiation, the photocatalytic bactericidal activity of CuL/PHI against aureus was nearly 100%, achieving the same antibacterial effect as antibiotics, after 10 minutes of low&#8208;dose light exposure and 2 hours of incubation.
