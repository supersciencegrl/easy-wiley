         <title>Spatiotemporally Resolved Orbital Hall Effect in a Topological Semimetal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Real&#8208;space mapping of orbital angular momentum (OAM) transport is achieved using contact&#8208;free polarimetric terahertz spectroscopy. This principle is applied to the topological semimetal Td&#8208;WTe2, revealing the spatial separation of electrons into two distinct regions characterized by opposite out&#8208;of&#8208;plane OAM (&#177;Lz). This work provides a direct visualization of the orbital Hall effect, paving the way for future investigations of orbitronics.








Abstract
Orbital angular momentum (OAM), once considered a marginal property in solids, has recently gained importance in various physical phenomena. Although optical probes couple to OAM directly, comparable low&#8208;energy electrodynamic methods are still in the early stages of development. To exploit the potential of OAM for information science and technology, angular momentum&#8208;resolved transport methods must be established. Here, a principle is presented for an angular momentum&#8208;resolved method to observe orbital Hall effect (OHE) in real space. The orbital conduction in the topological semimetal Td&#8208;WTe2 is measured using contact&#8208;free polarimetric terahertz probe, showing that two distinct regions of &#177;Lz with a diffusion length of &#8776;130&#160;&#181;m due to the extremely low scattering rate of Weyl fermions form in real space. The observed orbital conduction can be explained by OHE, according to theoretical calculations. By altering the polarization and intensity of the terahertz electric field input, it is also demonstrated that this orbital conduction can be engineered. Using a spatiotemporal low&#8208;energy electrodynamic probe, the work reveals direct evidence of coherent OHE in an inversion&#8208;broken topological semimetal with strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling&#8212;an experimentally elusive regime until now.

Cancer Immunotherapy
In article number 2501565, Xu Chen, Yihang Pan, Tianxin Lin, and co&#8208;workers have established a platform utilizing a CRISPR system&#8208;based bacterial outer membrane vesicle (OMV) for the efficient and cost&#8208;effective targeted delivery of plasmids. The intravesical administration of these engineered OMVs, which encoding CXCL&#8208;9 and IL&#8208;12, have been shown to effectively facilitating T&#8208;cell infiltration and activation. This process enhances the anti&#8208;tumor efficacy of OMV&#8208;mediated therapies and increases sensitivity to anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 treatments. Consequently, this approach presents a novel strategy to address resistance to immunotherapy in the context of bladder cancer.

Covalent Adaptable Networks
A covalent adaptable network with dynamic disulfide bonds enables both heat&#8208; and light&#8208;driven bond exchange. When combined with magnetic particles, its photoresponsiveness at room temperature facilitates contactless, reversible, and spatiotemporally controlled 3D shape reconfiguration and fixation during magnetomechanical actuation. More details can be found in article number 2503161 by Sohdam Jeong, Jeong Jae Wie, Chae Bin Kim, and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Design Strategies and Advancements in Organic Spintronics: from Material Engineering and Interfacial Modification to Functional Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Design strategies and advancements in organic spintronics are comprehensively discussed in this review. In the research of active layer materials, spinterface, ferromagnetic electrode preparation, and functional devices, numerous design strategies are devised to optimize their spin&#8208;related performance and propel this field toward practical applications in the near future.








Abstract
Organic spintronics, which has emerged as a burgeoning interdisciplinary subject, has recently attracted much research enthusiasm from both the scientific community and industry. As a category of materials typically composed of light elements, organic materials inherently possess weaker spin&#8210;orbit coupling and hyperfine interactions, which are considered beneficial for spin transport. Numerous organic materials have been meticulously synthesized to reveal their structure&#8210;performance relationships. The spinterface effect induced by the ferromagnetic metal/organic material interface has led to novel physical mechanisms. The development of functional devices has promoted this field toward practical applications. Herein, design strategies and advancements in this field are presented, focusing on active material design, interfacial modification, and functional devices. First, the review discusses the influence of the active layer design on spin&#8208;related properties, including the chemical structures of small molecules, polymers, their multicomponent regulation strategies, and chiral materials. Subsequently, the review enumerates reliable ferromagnetic electrode preparation methods and spinterface modification methods aimed at adjusting the spin injection and transport efficiency. Moreover, a comprehensive overview of the strategies for enhancing the performance of functional devices in this field is presented. Finally, a concise summary and prospective outlook are proposed, highlighting the necessity and potential for future advancements in organic spintronics.

         <title>Additive Manufacturing of Neuromorphic Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crossover of additive Manufacturing (AM) and neuromorphic engineering promises a new paradigm in the fabrication of intelligent hardware&#8212;one that is sustainable, scalable, cost&#8208;efficient, and customizable. The AM&#8208;printed neuromorphic hardware (electronics and mechanical systems) is examined, and we discussed the technological integration. Upon overcoming process incompatibility and limited resolution issues of AM, 3D&#8208;printed neuromorphic systems may revolutionize intelligent electronics.








Abstract
Neuromorphic engineering aims to create brain&#8208;inspired computing systems based on synaptic electronic hardware and neural network software. It combines intelligent materials, advanced processing technology, and computation programs. Additive manufacturing (AM), despite being one of the advanced manufacturing technologies capable of multimaterial processing at the microscale, is not widely applied in neuromorphic hardware fabrication. This gap suggests not only process incompatibility and limited resolution of AM but opportunities to create novel intelligent systems. Here, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in AM&#8208;printed neuromorphic hardware (synaptic electronics and mechanical systems) is reviewed and discussed the integration of AM techniques with neuromorphic engineering. An outlook of printed neuromorphic systems is provided with low cost and environmental impact but high customizability and design flexibility. With ongoing innovation in AM technologies and materials, AM is envisioned with high throughput and resolution for affordable, scalable, and customizable neuromorphic hardware production. The crossover of AM and neuromorphic engineering facilitates prototyping of brain&#8208;inspired computing architectures for efficient and analog computation. This approach may facilitate various applications including neuromorphic robotics, bionics, and real&#8208;time sensing.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological materials offer a novel platform for thermoelectric energy conversion through unique band features, including band inversion, linear Dirac bands, surface states, and Berry curvature. These quantum characteristics enable enhanced longitudinal and transverse thermoelectric effects, establishing topological thermoelectrics as a promising frontier for both fundamental research and advanced energy technologies.








Abstract
Thermoelectric (TE) effect, which enables the direct conversion of heat into electricity or vice versa, has great importance for condensed matter physics and material science due to its great potential for sustainable energy applications. Topological materials, with their topologically nontrivial band structures and rich physical phenomena, offer exciting opportunities for achieving efficient TE energy conversion. Here, an overview of the recent theoretical is provided and experimental advances at the intersection of topology and thermoelectricity. The unique features of topological materials are examined, such as band inversion, topological surface/edge states, linear Dirac/Weyl bands, and Berry curvature, affect their TE transport properties. Additionally, the potential of band topology to enhance both longitudinal and transverse TE performance is discussed. The current challenges and prospects for further advancing topological TE materials and devices are identified, aiming to develop high&#8208;performance TE materials and devices.

         <title>Ordering Engineering among the Nanostructure Evolution Facilitates High&#8208;Performance Li Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ordering engineering among the nanostructure evolution has emerged as a promising strategy to address the issues of lithium (Li) metal anode, which involves enhancing the structural ordering of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), managing the distribution and orientation of inorganic components within SEI, and optimizing the morphostructure and texture of Li deposition.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) with extremely high energy density have emerged as highly promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. However, the inferior lifespan and safety hazards hinder their practical applications, which arise from the disordered nanostructure at anodic interface, such as mosaic solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and nonuniform Li deposition. Ordering engineering among the nanostructure evolution has emerged as a promising strategy to address these issues, which involves enhancing the structural ordering of SEI, managing the distribution and orientation of inorganic components within SEI, and optimizing the morphostructure and texture of Li deposition. Herein, recent advances in ordering engineering which effectively promote the interface ordering are systematically summarized. The importance of constructing a multilayer SEI with oriented inorganic components and achieving strong Li texture with preferred crystal plane is highlighted. Furthermore, advanced characterization techniques employed in ordering engineering are critically reviewed. Finally, the comprehensive examination of challenges encountered in ordering engineering is presented and promising research pathways for future investigation are highlighted. This review aims to encourage discussion and research on the ordering engineering in LMBs, with the goal of enhancing cycle life and safety to accelerate their practical applications.

         <title>Designing the Next Generation of Biomaterials through Nanoengineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoengineering enables precise control over biomaterial interactions with living systems by tuning surface energy, defects, porosity, and crystallinity. This review highlights how these nanoscale design parameters drive advances in regenerative medicine, drug delivery, bioprinting, biosensing, and bioimaging, while outlining key translational challenges and future directions.








Abstract
Recent advances in biomaterials science have applied nanoengineering to develop biomaterials with superior properties and tailored functionalities. These unique attributes are achieved due to the ability of nanoengineering to provide precise control over material interactions with living systems at the molecular scale. Here, key nanotechnologies employed to develop the next generation of biomaterials are critically evaluated. A diverse range of nanomaterials, differing in base materials, shapes, sizes, or surface properties can be integrated into various fabrication processes to develop these advanced biomaterials. Further investigation is required into properties such as surface energy, defects, porosity, and crystallinity, as these critically influence the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of nanoengineered materials. Consequently, we explore diverse biomedical applications of nanoengineered biomaterials, including regenerative medicine, biomolecular delivery, additive manufacturing, immune engineering, cancer therapeutics, bioimaging, biosensing, antimicrobial devices, and tissue adhesives. Additionally, their current limitations are analyzed and emerging strategies for designing the next generation of nanoengineered biomaterials are highlighted.

         <title>Cutting&#8208;Edge Developments at the Interface of Inorganic Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (ISEs) and their pivotal role in solid&#8208;state battery (SSB) development. It examines various ISE categories, interface characteristics, and commercialization challenges while highlighting advanced characterization techniques and the transformative impact of machine learning in enhancing ISE performance and addressing existing technological barriers.








Abstract
Inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (ISEs) are critical components of solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs), and their interfacial properties play a decisive role in battery performance. This paper systematically reviews the recent advances in the interfaces of ISEs. It begins by defining and classifying ISEs&#8212;encompassing oxides, sulfides, and halides&#8212;while highlighting their fundamental characteristics, potential applications, and existing interface challenges. The discussion extends to the composition, structure, and reaction phenomena at the interfaces of SSBs, focusing on how these factors influence internal resistance, cycling stability, and safety. We detail advanced microscopic and spectroscopic techniques employed to investigate interfacial microstructures and chemical properties, as well as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance for electrical and structural analysis, while also highlighting emerging modalities for interface characterization in SSBs. Additionally, we explore the role of informatics strategies, particularly high&#8208;throughput computing and machine learning, in predicting interfacial stability, calculating ionic transport properties, and screening new materials to optimize interface engineering. Despite noteworthy progress in understanding ISE interfaces, challenges remain that hinder the commercialization of SSBs. Future research efforts should prioritize the optimization of interfacial structures and properties through multi&#8208;scale and multi&#8208;technique approaches to further accelerate SSB development.

         <title>Strategies for Continuous Responsive Motion in a Constant Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The key to achieving continuous responsive motion lies in a negative feedback loop between the stimuli received by the responsive material and its own motion behavior. Therefore, this review summarizes four strategies for constructing feedback loops in responsive motion systems, including B&#8208;Z reaction strategy, self&#8208;shadowing effect strategy, gradient stimulus field strategy, and complex device&#8208;based strategy.








Abstract
Continuous responsive motion gains significant attention due to its widespread applications in autonomous braking systems, low&#8208;power generation, human&#8208;computer interaction, and other fields. Continuous responsive motion in a constant environment is particularly important because it enables self&#8208;sustained actuation in unmanned settings. In this review, four strategies are summarized for continuous responsive motion in a constant environment and elaborate on the mechanisms, including the Belousov&#8208;Zhabotinsky reaction strategy, the self&#8208;shadowing effect strategy, the gradient stimulus field strategy, and the complex device&#8208;based strategy. This study first provides a brief overview of the development history of continuous responsive motion systems in a constant environment. Then, the basic principles, advantages, disadvantages, and application scopes of the four strategies are illustrated. Afterward, the applications of these continuous responsive motion systems are summarized. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives are presented for the field of continuous responsive motion in a constant environment, offering inspiration for the development of new continuous responsive motion systems.

With enhanced light absorption and high thermal conductivity, biomass materials can improve evaporation efficiency substantially, thus providing opportunities in solar evaporation applications. Therefore, in this critical review, the operating principles and design concepts of solar evaporators are first briefly discussed in terms of the photothermal conversion mechanism. Subsequently, the superiority of biomass materials in solar evaporator design is described in detail from the types of biomass and their structural properties at micro/macro scales. The design principles and corresponding performance enhancement strategies for biomass&#8208;based evaporators are also highlighted, including material selection, structural design, and thermal management techniques. Meanwhile, recent advances in biomass&#8208;based evaporators for several cutting&#8208;edge applications are comprehensively discussed. This review can provide a comprehensive reference for the relevant researchers to advance the research and application of biomass&#8208;based solar evaporators and to promote their wide application in the field of green technology.

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework and Nanocellulose Composites for Multifunctional Environmental Remediation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoscale metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and nanocellulose composites have significant potential for the multi&#8208;functional remediation of the environment. This review focused on the synthesis strategies (in situ growth, ex situ growth, and other approaches), typical forms (aerogel, hydrogel, beads, and membrane), and applications in the removal of common pollutants (dye, pharmaceuticals, heavy metal ions, VOCs, CO2, PM, and others) in the environment by MOFs&#8208;nanocellulose (MOFs&#8208;NC) composites. The future perspectives and current challenges of MOFs&#8208;NC composites in environmental remediation applications are also pointed out.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are widely used in environmental remediation due to their unique properties. However, their practical applications are significantly limited by its powder crystal form. To address these limitations, MOFs can be integrated with abundant and sustainable biomass&#8208;derived nanocellulose (NC) to construct processable macroscopic architectures. Herein, this review discusses recent advances in the preparation of multi&#8208;dimensional macroscopic materials from MOFs&#8208;NC and their applications in environmental remediation, including dye adsorption and degradation, pharmaceutical removal, heavy metal ion capture, adsorption and degradation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), CO2 capture and separation, particulate matter (PM) separation, and others. A summary of two commonly used strategies for preparing MOFs&#8208;NC composites proposes a valuable insight on how processable macroscopic architectures can be effectively achieved. Furthermore, this review provides an overview of the structure&#8208;property&#8208;function relationship between multi&#8208;dimensional MOFs&#8208;NC composites and highlights their versatile applications in the remediation of polluted environments. The mechanisms, challenges, and future prospects of the material in removing environmental pollutants are also present in detail. This review aims to guide researchers in designing high&#8208;performance, multi&#8208;functional, sustainable, and scalable MOFs&#8208;NC composites for future environmental remediation.

         <title>Solving Mazes of Organelle&#8208;Targeted Therapies with DNA Nanomachines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the evolution of DNA nanomachines as a transformative approach for organelle&#8208;specific cancer treatment. Their design principles, therapeutic mechanisms, and enhanced selectivity for precise drug delivery and activation of cell death pathways are examined. Key strategies for subcellular targeting, therapeutic advantages, and the integration of AI&#8208;driven research to accelerate innovation are discussed, providing a roadmap for future clinical translation in advanced cancer nanomedicine.








Abstract
Despite decades of research, cancer remains a growing global health challenge. Nanomaterials&#8208;based therapeutics have shown promise, but their clinical applications are often limited by poor selectivity and undesirable side effects. Recently, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) based nanomachines have gained attention as intelligent drug carriers due to their ability to precisely target specific organelles. By leveraging rationally designed DNA nanomachines, it is possible to directly attack subcellular structures or deliver therapeutic agents to precise locations, triggering organelle&#8208;mediated cell death. This innovative approach offers several advantages, including enhanced efficacy, lower dosages, minimized off&#8208;target effects, reduced multidrug resistance, and improved therapeutic durability. This review explores the history and advancements of organelle&#8208;targeting strategies, providing new insights into targeting the nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes using DNA nanomachines. The review also discusses the structures, design principles, and therapeutic mechanisms of these nanomachines, along with the integration of artificial intelligence&#8208;driven self&#8208;driving laboratories to enhance research growth, efficiency, and competitiveness. Finally, the current challenges, opportunities, and future directions in this evolving field are addressed, offering a roadmap for solving the intricate maze of organelle&#8208;targeted cancer therapies.

         <title>Mechanism&#8208;Guided Thermoelectric Strategies for Smart Fire Prevention</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in thermoelectric materials for smart fire prevention and early warning. Mechanism&#8208;guided strategies&#8212;such as structural design, energy filtering, ion doping, and ionic thermoelectric effects&#8212;are systematically discussed, offering insights into the development of self&#8208;powered, high&#8208;sensitivity fire warning systems and their integration into next&#8208;generation intelligent fire safety technologies.








Abstract
Fire prevention and early warning systems are essential to minimize fire risks. Thermoelectric (TE) materials that convert temperature gradients into electrical signals offer a promising pathway for designing self&#8208;powered fire&#8208;warning technologies and devices; however, their practical applications are often impeded by their low output power, inefficient charge transport, and poor interfacial compatibility. Despite several relevant reviews focusing on material types, it has remained underexplored from a mechanism&#8208;driven perspective to enhance the fire prevention performance of TE strategies to date. To fill this knowledge gap, this work aims to systematically review TE materials and design strategies, e.g., structural design, energy filtering, ion doping, ionic thermoelectric effects, and interfacial engineering. This work highlights typical applications of TE&#8208;driven fire prevention systems, such as wearable sensors, distributed forest fire monitoring networks, and intelligent building safety systems. Finally, future directions are discussed, which include multifunctional integration, durability under harsh conditions, and AI&#8208;driven fire prediction, paving the way for developing intelligent, self&#8208;powered fire safety technologies. This work underpins how mechanism&#8208;oriented material design advances next&#8208;generation fire warning systems with enhanced sensitivity, environmental adaptability, and autonomous operation, thereby expediting the creation of next&#8208;generation fire&#8208;prevention system and platform.

         <title>Hard Carbon for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries: From Fundamental Research to Practical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a promising anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, hard carbon stands out with its high Na storage capacity, structural stability, and safety. This review comprehensively summarizes and discusses its structural models, Na storage mechanisms, diverse modification strategies, and full&#8208;cell integration challenges, aiming to guide the development of high&#8208;performance, cost&#8208;effective sodium&#8208;ion batteries and inspire future research directions.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as a promising technology for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their unique performance characteristics and raw material accessibility. Among various anode materials, hard carbon (HC) stands out due to its high Na storage capacity, structural stability, and intrinsic safety. However, the structural complexity and heterogeneity of HC present ongoing challenges in understanding its structural models and Na storage mechanisms, impeding the rational design and performance optimization of HC&#8208;based anodes. This review provides a systematic overview of recent advances in HC for SIBs, beginning with an in&#8208;depth examination of representative structural models and the underlying structure&#8211;property relationships. The review critically analyzes Na storage mechanisms and bridges these insights with a diverse array of modification strategies&#8212;including precursor design, structural tailoring, and surface/interface optimization. Special emphasis is placed on improving initial Coulombic efficiency, rate capability, and long&#8208;term cycling stability. Furthermore, practical challenges related to full&#8208;cell integration are discussed, such as pre&#8208;sodiation techniques and electrolyte/interface engineering&#160;to enhance the real&#8208;world applicability of HC. By integrating fundamental understanding with forward&#8208;looking design strategies, this review provides&#160;a valuable reference for the development of high&#8208;performance, cost&#8208;effective SIB systems, and to inspire future research directions in sodium&#8208;ion energy storage.

         <title>Personalized 3D Vaccine Integrates Immunotherapy and Antiangiogenic Therapy to Prevent Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Recurrence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ToC Figure Ren et&#160;al. develop 3D&#8208;Vax&#8208;L, a 3D&#8208;printed hydrogel vaccine integrating tumor lysates and lenvatinib to mimic lymph node functions. This vaccine recruits immune cells, inhibits angiogenesis, and prevents oral cancer recurrence, ultimately enhancing survival and preserving facial integrity post&#8208;surgery. It represents a novel, clinically translatable approach for postoperative OSCC recurrence treatment.








Abstract
The immune&#8208;suppressive microenvironment and extensive tumor angiogenesis are key contributors to the high recurrence and mortality rates of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). To address these challenges, a personalized 3D&#8208;printed anti&#8208;tumor vaccine (3D&#8208;Vax&#8208;L) is developed that integrates whole tumor antigens from postoperative tissue lysates with the angiogenesis inhibitor, lenvatinib. This vaccine not only possesses inherent adjuvant properties but also mimics the functions of lymph nodes through its porous structure, facilitating the recruitment and maturation of immune cells. In vivo studies in OSCC animal models, including mice and rabbits, demonstrate that 3D&#8208;Vax&#8208;L effectively recruits and matures immune cells at postoperative sites, inhibits angiogenesis and tumor recurrence, and extends survival time, all while maintaining a stable morphology and an excellent biosafety. Furthermore, 3D&#8208;Vax&#8208;L supports facial integrity post&#8208;surgery, addressing physical challenges by preventing collapse and reducing the risk of aesthetic&#8208;related disorders. These findings suggest that 3D&#8208;Vax&#8208;L is a promising therapeutic technique for preventing post&#8208;surgical OSCC relapse, particularly as it offers a new strategy for immune system activation and demonstrates significant potential for clinical translation.

         <title>High Rate Capability and Cycling Stability in Multi&#8208;Domain Nanocomposite LiNi1&#8211;xTi3x/4O2 Positive Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By targeting nominally non&#8208;stoichiometric LiNi1&#8211;xTi3x/4O2 compositions, a multi&#8208;domain nanocomposite rock salt positive electrode material with exceptional cycling stability and excellent rate performance is obtained. This enhanced performance particularly under high oxidative potential protocols and cell electrode mass loadings applicable to commercial cells represents a significant advance for LiNiO2&#8208;based positive electrode materials.








Abstract
LiNiO2 positive electrode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries have experienced a revival of interest due to increasing technological energy demands. Herein a specific Ti4+ substitution is targeted into LiNiO2 to access new compositions by synthesizing the LiNi1&#8211;xTi3x/4O2 solid solution with the aim of retaining Ni3+. Compositions in the range 0.025 &#8804; x &#8804; 0.2 form nanocomposites of compositionally homogeneous ordered R3&#175;$\bar 3$m and disordered Fm3&#175;$\bar 3$m rock salt domains as observed via X&#8208;ray and neutron diffraction, and STEM. The disordered rock salt domains stabilize the ordered structure to provide excellent structural reversibility via the formation of coherent interfaces during cycling and enable deep delithiation using a constant voltage charging step without structural degradation. The detrimental structural phase transitions associated with the poor cyclability of LiNiO2 are suppressed to yield a low strain positive electrode material with high capacity retention that offers high&#8208;rate capability even under increased cell electrode mass loadings. The composition x = 0.075 (LiNi0.925Ti0.05625O2) affords a 93% capacity retention after 100 cycles (100&#160;mA g&#8722;1) and demonstrates high reversible capacities of 125 mAh g&#8722;1 even under rates of 3200&#160;mA g&#8722;1. LiNi0.925Ti0.05625O2 exhibits exceptional performance at electrode mass loadings (13.6&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) comparable to those required for commercial cell applications.

         <title>A Novel Time&#8208;Division Multiplexing Architecture Revealed by Reconfigurable Synapse for Deep Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a novel double gate&#8208;controlled synapse transistor featuring a graphene/2D perovskite/carbon nanotubes heterostructure is developed, enabling reconfigurable synaptic memory to support Time&#8208;Division Multiplexing (TDM)&#8208;based neural networks. More surprisingly, as the scale of the neural network model gradually increases, the benefits of TDM become more pronounced.








Abstract
Deep learning's growing complexity demands advanced AI chips, increasing hardware costs. Time&#8208;division multiplexing (TDM) neural networks offer a promising solution to simplify integration. However, it is difficult for current synapse transistors to physically implement TDM networks due to inherent device limitations, hindering their practical deployment in modern systems. Here, a novel graphene/2D perovskite/carbon nanotubes (CNTs) synapse transistor featuring a sandwich structure is presented. This transistor enables the realization of TDM neural networks at the hardware level. In this structure, the 2D perovskite layer, characterized by high ion concentration, serves as a neurotransmitter, thereby enhancing synaptic transmission efficiency. Additionally, the CNTs' field&#8208;effect transistors, with their large on&#8208;off ratio, demonstrate a wider range of synaptic current changes. The device mechanism is theoretically analyzed using molecular dynamics simulation. Furthermore, the impact of TDM on the scale, power, and latency of neural network hardware implementation is investigated. Qualitative analysis is performed to elucidate the advantages of TDM in the hardware implementation of larger deep learning models. This study offers a new approach to reducing the integration complexity of neural networks hardware implementation, holding significant promise for the development of intelligent nanoelectronic devices in the future.

         <title>Remote&#8208;Controlled Magnetic Stimulation of Cell&#8208;Based Bioengineered Tissues for In Situ Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic nanoparticles and magnetic fields enable the construction of 3D tissues from individual cells and their stimulation, activating signaling pathways that influence tissue function. Herein, cyclic magnetic fields induce mechanical perturbations in magnetically responsive tissue implants, promoting osteodifferentiation of human adipose&#8208;derived stem cells without biochemical supplementation, enhancing implant integration in vivo, highlighting potential for minimally invasive bone repair strategies.








Abstract
The native cell microenvironment activates signaling pathways through mechanotransduction mechanisms, influencing cells&#8217; physiological and functional outcomes. Magnetic fields are explored to manipulate these environments, and magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are highlighted as nano&#8208;instructive agents capable of activating key signaling pathways, presenting exciting possibilities in tissue engineering. Still, the ability to precisely control the assembly and differentiation of stem cells within a dynamically responsive microenvironment, crucial for effective tissue regeneration, remains unexplored. This study showcases a novel method wherein MNPs facilitate the precise assembly of magnetically responsive cells into complex 3D tissue structures upon internalization and exposure to temporally defined cyclic magnetic fields. By remotely stimulating these constructs, it is demonstrated for the first time the possibility of remote&#8208;controlled modulation of stem cell fate in vivo without biochemical supplementation. Notably, this approach led to ectopic bone formation, highlighting the ability of magnetic actuation to drive osteogenesis in non&#8208;bone environments. MNP&#8208;driven mechanical stimulation of implanted tissues functions as a bioresponsive system guiding osteogenic differentiation of human adipose&#8208;derived stem cells. The in vivo model further illustrates accelerated construct integration, enhanced osteogenic differentiation, and minimal local inflammation, underscoring the potential of this less invasive, remotely controllable platform to advance regenerative strategies for bone engineering.

         <title>Tri&#8208;System Interlocking Top&#8208;Encased Structures Enabled Highly Stable Tin&#8208;Lead Perovskite Photodetection Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique tri&#8208;system interlocking top&#8208;encased structure is formed for tin&#8208;lead perovskites by the introduction of novel CGA additive. The fabricated tin&#8208;lead perovskite NIR photodetector shows an outstanding specific detectivity of 2 &#215; 1013 Jones at 940 nm, and the integrated 64 &#215; 64 array demonstrates clear and accurate imaging abilities.









Abstract
Tin&#8208;lead binary perovskites show a very broad spectral bandwidth from ultraviolet (UV) to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) and outstanding optoelectronic properties for photodetection applications. However, the oxidation tendency of the divalent tin easily causes severe vacancies and defects, deteriorating the efficiency and stability of the device. In this work, without involving any costly synthesis of additives, a natural reducing agent of chlorogenic acid is proposed to establish a unique top&#8208;encased tri&#8208;system interlocking structure in tin&#8208;lead perovskites. Benefiting from the synergetic closed&#8208;loop interactions among functional groups of the additive with perovskites, tin&#8208;lead perovskite photodetectors (PDs) are demonstrated with improvements in energy&#8208;level alignment, antioxidation, and defect suppression and passivation. Finally, the self&#8208;powered perovskite NIR PDs present a high external quantum efficiency of &#8776;76%, an outstanding specific detectivity of 2 &#215; 1013 Jones at 940&#160;nm, and a large linear dynamic range of 222&#160;dB, along with good stability maintaining 96% of initial photocurrent after 127 days for the unencapsulated PDs storing under N2 atmosphere. By integrating with a 64 &#215; 64 thin&#8208;film transistor array, the tin&#8208;lead perovskite image sensor exhibits clear and accurate imaging properties, paving the way for a wide range of high&#8208;detectivity and high&#8208;resolution imaging applications.

         <title>Signal Transducer Nanoparticles Enable Siglec&#8208;10/G Blockade Immunotherapy for Breast Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel antibody&#8208;free approach to block the &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; CD24&#8208;Siglec&#8208;10/G signaling is achieved through using the CD24 signal transducer peptide&#8208;anchored nanoparticles (STNPs). These STNPs effectively engage with macrophages, promoting enhanced phagocytosis of breast cancer cells, triggering a broad immune response, and ultimately inhibiting tumor growth.








Abstract
Current treatments for breast cancer (BC), particularly triple&#8208;negative BC, are limited in efficacy due to drug resistance and high recurrence rates. CD24, which is highly expressed in BCs and engages with its receptor Siglec&#8208;10/G (Siglec&#8208;10 in humans and Siglec&#8208;G in mice) on immune cells, represents a promising immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) target. As the engagement is mediated by a short signal transducer (ST) peptide displayed on the BC cell surface, targeting the peptide using antibodies has shown to be effective for BC treatment. Herein, an antibody&#8208;free approach is reported to achieve blockade of the CD24&#8208;Siglec&#8208;10/G signaling through the synthesis of signal transducer peptide&#8208;anchored nanoparticles (STNPs). The STNPs can effectively engage with macrophages, promoting enhanced phagocytosis of BC cells, triggering a broad immune response, and ultimately inhibiting tumor growth. The therapeutic effects can be further improved through encapsulation of RRx&#8208;001, a small molecule inhibitor of the CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; signaling. Compared to the antibody approach, the synthetic nanoparticle approach offers greater efficacy with lower side effects and enables combination therapy through a simple formulation. Moreover, the approach is versatile and could be adapted for targeting other ICB signaling, advancing the next generation of cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>An Intrinsically Stretchable Skin&#8208;Adhesive Actuator With Structurally Anisotropic Multiphase Microarchitectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intrinsically stretchable skin&#8208;adhesive actuator is realized using a hybrid architecture combining anisotropic and isotropic 3D porous dielectric architectures. The seamless integration of an intrinsically stretchable skin&#8208;adhesive actuator ensures reliable haptic feedback even under extreme deformation. Featuring a bio&#8208;inspired design, it forms a conformal contact with human skin, effectively stimulating tactile receptors with high&#8208;vibration acceleration, delivering precise and high&#8208;fidelity feedback.








Abstract
Skin&#8208;attachable actuators require robust adhesion and high&#8208;fidelity feedback to conform to the skin under extreme deformation, integrating seamlessly while minimizing damping effects for diverse practical applications. Current rigid haptic interfaces and soft dielectric materials are limited to operating effectively within specific resonance frequencies, exhibiting a mechanical mismatch with human skin, which reduces their effectiveness on highly deformable body parts and decreases the accuracy of vibration feedback. Moreover, intrinsically stretchable dielectric materials face challenges caused by layer integration and significant damping from single anisotropic architectures. Here, an intrinsically stretchable skin&#8208;adhesive actuator (ISSA) with a multiphase dielectric architecture is presented that combines an isotropic spring matrix and an anisotropic elastic damper matrix, achieving stable vibration performance beyond the resonance frequency. The intrinsically stretchable electrode with its hybrid 1D/0D percolated structure ensures adaptability and reliable performance under strains exceeding 500%, whereas the frog&#8208;inspired adhesive enhances skin conformity and breathability, providing robust shear strength (&#8776;28.4&#160;kPa) under extreme deformation. Owing to a seamlessly integrated design and ultralow modulus (&lt;24&#160;kPa), the skin&#8208;adhesive actuator closely conforms to the human skin, delivering high vibrational acceleration while ensuring biocompatibility and durability for transformative applications in soft robotics, human&#8211;machine interfaces, and haptic technologies.

         <title>Enhanced Ising Superconductivity and Emergent Ferromagnetism Coexisting in Bimolecule&#8208;Intercalated Bulk TaS2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Researchers report the coexistence of Ising superconductivity and ferromagnetism in TBAC/DMF&#8208;intercalated TaS2, accompanied by a quantum Griffiths singularity. This structure results in an enhanced 2D Ising superconductivity, with the in&#8208;plane upper critical field reaching five times the Pauli limit and the superconducting temperature increasing to &#8776;2.7 K. Distinct ferromagnetic ordering persists from below the superconducting temperature up to 365 K.








Abstract
Superconductivity and ferromagnetism are mutually exclusive in most cases. Here the observation of Ising superconductivity and ferromagnetism coexisting is reported in a bimolecule (tetrabutylammonium chloride and dimethylformamide, or TBAC/DMF)&#8208;intercalated bulk TaS2, with the exotic phenomenon of quantum Griffiths singularity. It is first shown that the neighboring TaS2 layers are separated by 14.7 &#197;, indicating vertical stacking of the TBAC and DMF molecules. Such a record&#8208;large interlayer spacing renders each TaS2 layer to be of exceptionally 2D nature in an otherwise 3D structure, as manifested by substantially enhanced Ising superconductivity with in&#8208;plane upper critical field five times the Pauli limit. The corresponding superconducting transition temperature is &#8776;2.7 K, more than tripled from that of pristine bulk TaS2 (&#8776;0.8 K), and again approaches that of monolayer TaS2 (&#8776;3 K). Strikingly, distinct ferromagnetism is observed below the superconducting temperature, and the ferromagnetic order persists all the way up to 365 K. These findings characterize TBAC/DMF&#8208;TaS2 as a fertile platform for exploration of rich physical phenomena with significant technological potentials in superconducting spintronics.

         <title>Acousto&#8208;Electric Conversion by the Piezoelectric Nanogenerator of a Molecular Copper(II) Complex</title>

A Piezoelectric Nanogenerator (PENG) fabricated with the discrete molecular ferroelectric Cu(II) complex Cu2(L&#8208;phe)2(bpy)2(H2O)2&#183;2H2O (1, Tc &gt; 380K) exhibits outstanding acoustoelectric conversion and 95% accurate AI/ML&#8208;driven voice recognition. It delivers high output performance (output voltage 4.94&#160;V, short&#8208;circuit current 3.42&#160;&#181;A), rapid capacitor charging, and efficient pressure and motion sensing as well.








Abstract
The conversion of sound waves into electrical energy holds immense potential in various real&#8208;life applications, particularly biomedical devices, smart security sensors, and noise pollution detectors. Yet, the field is largely underexplored, due to the limited availability of materials that operate efficiently at low frequencies of sound waves. Piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs), which generate electric charges through deformations caused by sound&#8208;induced pressure variations, emerge as promising candidates for acoustoelectric conversion. However, the rigidity and toxicity, of traditional piezoelectric bulk oxide&#8208;based PENGs make them unsuitable for wearable electronics and healthcare monitoring devices. As an alternative, we present an efficient, flexible PENG and acoustic nanogenerator (AcNG) based on a molecular ferroelectric [Cu2(L&#8208;phe)2(bpy)2(H2O)] (BF4)2.2H2O (1) complex with an impressive output peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak voltage of 4.94&#160;V and an acoustoelectric conversion of 40&#160;mV from 60&#160;Hz soundwave is disclosed. Leveraging the sensitive low&#8208;frequency detection limit of this AcNG combined with a Machine Learning (ML) approach, voices can be distinguished with a surprising accuracy of 95%. Additionally, these devices enable rapid capacitor charging (within 10&#160;s), highly sensitive pressure sensing (low as 4&#160;kPa), and detecting human physiological motion, holding promise for their applications in biometric voice recognition, enhanced national security (AI&#8208;driven voice&#8208;recognition), and biomedical diagnostics.

         <title>Dielectric Aggregation&#8208;Mediated Dual&#8208;Band Robust Optical Performance for Low&#8208;Cost Radiative Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via a gravity&#8208;induced particle aggregation strategy, the distribution of merely 4 vol% packed dielectric silica in the porous skeleton is tuned to yield a decoupled spectral response spanning two orders of magnitude. This strategy allows for on&#8208;demand manufacture of other types of metamaterials and integrates robust weather resistance properties.








Abstract
Radiative cooling belongs to passively enhanced heat dissipation that reflects sunlight and emits infrared radiation. However, conflicting reflectivity and emissivity across the two bands present challenges to reach 95% performance simultaneously, while a few available photonic reports have shortcomings in terms of scalability and environmental stability. The decoupling optimization of scattering and absorption is demonstrated by modulating the aggregation state of merely 4 vol% dielectrics in the porous skeleton. It allows Mie scattering and resonant absorption to function in their respective bands, resulting in a double 95% optical performance. Such a broad spectral response enables high&#8208;throughput heat dissipation of 8&#160;&#176;C and supports subambient cooling of 5&#160;&#176;C outdoors. This one&#8208;step strategy extends to the manufacture of a range of metamaterials as required for strength, heat resistance, and degradation, combined with robust environmental stability, including resistance to fouling and peeling.

         <title>Reconfigurable Liquid Crystal&#8208;Based Physical Unclonable Function Integrating Optical and Electrical Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reconfigurable physical unclonable function (PUF) integrating optical and electrical responses in organic field&#8208;effect transistor is developed by using unique optical fingerprint textures and random molecular alignment of the semiconductive smectic liquid crystal. This approach enhances security by enabling hierarchical authentication, providing robust solutions for anticounterfeiting and cryptographic applications.








Abstract
Physical unclonable functions (PUFs)&#8212;a hardware&#8208;based security device using randomness&#8212;have evolved from basic integrated circuit designs to advanced systems using diverse materials and mechanisms. However, most PUFs are limited by single&#8208;factor challenges and fixed key generation, making them vulnerable to brute&#8208;force attacks. A reconfigurable and multidimensional liquid crystal (LC)&#8208;based PUF is presented integrated into an organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) to address limitations. This system combines optical and electrical PUFs through unique optical fingerprint textures and random molecular alignment of the semiconductive smectic LC material. The PUF can be reconfigured by a simple heating and cooling process, overcoming the limitations of fixed&#8208;structure PUFs. Furthermore, this approach enhances security by enabling hierarchical authentication due to the multi&#8208;response factors, providing robust solutions for anticounterfeiting and cryptographic applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Speed Raman Readout of Single Polypeptides via Plasmonic Nanopores</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A label&#8208;free method is presented for single&#8208;protein investigation using plasmonic nanopores that enable stable, cost&#8208;effective Raman detection of polypeptides in real time. An average of 6 photons is measured during a dwell time of 7 microseconds per amino acid. The linear correlations are observed between dwell time, molecular length, and signal, suggesting the feasibility of sequential Raman readout.









Abstract
The ability to identify individual protein molecules using Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) spectroscopy, without the need for labelling, is a significant advancement in biomedical diagnostics. However, the inherently small Raman scattering cross&#8208;section of most (bio) molecules necessitates significant signal amplification for successful detection, particularly at the single&#8208;molecule level. A novel approach is introduced for fabricating plasmonic nanopores suitable for sequential Raman readout, namely the recording of Raman spectra from portions of molecules, which are progressively flowing into plasmonic hot spots. The method is based on Capillary&#8208;Assisted Particle Assembly (CAPA)of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs), thus ensuring high stability and cost&#8208;effectiveness. By electrophoretically driving polypeptides through these nanopores, real&#8208;time Raman detection is achieved with a Single&#8208;Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) camera, attaining single&#8208;molecule detection at 1&#160;nm concentration with 100 microsecond resolution. Statistical analysis of translocation times, photon scattering rates, and spectral data confirms a linear correlation between dwell time, molecular length, and Raman signal intensity. On average, a photon scattering of 6 photons/amino acid and a translocation time of 7 &#181;s per amino acid is recorded. These results demonstrate the feasibility of sequential Raman readout, overcoming key limitations of SERS. This method represents a significant step toward label&#8208;free, high&#8208;resolution molecular identification, with future potential applications in protein identification.

An average of 6 photons is measured during a dwell time of 7 microseconds per amino acid. The linear correlations are observed between dwell time, molecular length, and signal, suggesting the feasibility of sequential Raman readout.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to identify individual protein molecules using Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) spectroscopy, without the need for labelling, is a significant advancement in biomedical diagnostics. However, the inherently small Raman scattering cross-section of most (bio) molecules necessitates significant signal amplification for successful detection, particularly at the single-molecule level. A novel approach is introduced for fabricating plasmonic nanopores suitable for sequential Raman readout, namely the recording of Raman spectra from portions of molecules, which are progressively flowing into plasmonic hot spots. The method is based on Capillary-Assisted Particle Assembly (CAPA)of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs), thus ensuring high stability and cost-effectiveness. By electrophoretically driving polypeptides through these nanopores, real-time Raman detection is achieved with a Single-Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) camera, attaining single-molecule detection at 1&#160;n&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; concentration with 100 microsecond resolution. Statistical analysis of translocation times, photon scattering rates, and spectral data confirms a linear correlation between dwell time, molecular length, and Raman signal intensity. On average, a photon scattering of 6 photons/amino acid and a translocation time of 7 &#181;s per amino acid is recorded. These results demonstrate the feasibility of sequential Raman readout, overcoming key limitations of SERS. This method represents a significant step toward label-free, high-resolution molecular identification, with future potential applications in protein identification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Flippase&#8208;Mediated Hybrid Vesicle Division</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful reconstitution of Drs2p&#8211;Cdc50p flippase in small and giant polymer lipid hybrid vesicles is illustrated. The hybrid vesicles show adenosine 5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate consumption and flipping of 2&#8208;dioleoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phospho&#8208;l&#8208;serine lipids from the inner to the outer leaflet. This induced transmembrane asymmetry results in constriction and division of the giant hybrid vesicles.








Abstract
The assembly of synthetic systems with the ability for protein&#8208;mediated division remains a challenge in bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology. Here, the reconstitution of an active Drs2p&#8211;Cdc50p lipid flippase in polymer lipid hybrid vesicles (HVs) made from phospholipids and 1 or 2.5 mol% amphiphilic block copolymers, with poly(carboxyethyl acrylate) or poly(6&#8208;O&#8208;methacryloyl&#8208;d&#8208;galactopyranose) as the hydrophilic extension and either cholesteryl methacrylate or butyl methacrylate or combinations thereof as the hydrophobic blocks is demonstrated. The reconstitution of Drs2p&#8211;Cdc50p in HVs flip 2&#8208;dioleoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phospho&#8208;l&#8208;serine (DOPS) lipids from the inner to the outer leaflet, leading to transmembrane asymmetry. Importantly, the chemical nature of the hydrophobic block in the amphiphilic block copolymers used to assemble the HVs is crucial to support changes in the spontaneous curvature of the bilayers due to translocation of DOPS lipids that results in HV constriction and division. Taken together, this effort is a step forward in imitating cell division in synthetic assemblies toward potentially bottom&#8208;up assembled self&#8208;replicating units.

         <title>Bulk&#8208;Rashba Effect with Suppressed Spin Relaxation in a Polar Phase of Bi1&#8208;xIn1+xO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates the bulk&#8208;Rashba effect with enhanced spin&#8208;relaxation time in a new polar phase of Bi1&#8208;xIn1+xO3 (x &#8776; 0.15&#8211;0.34). Unlike typical Rashba systems, which suffer from rapid spin relaxation, this polar phase of Bi1&#8208;xIn1+xO3 exhibits both high Rashba strength and long spin&#8208;relaxation time due to a polar&#8208;crystal symmetry with a unidirectional spin texture. This work expands Rashba physics to 3D systems, with potential for spintronic devices.








Abstract
The Rashba effect enables control over the spin degree of freedom, particularly in polar materials where the polar symmetry couples to Rashba&#8208;type spin splitting. The exploration of this effect, however, has been hindered by the scarcity of polar materials exhibiting the bulk&#8208;Rashba effect and rapid spin&#8208;relaxation effects dictated by the D'yakonov&#8211;Perel mechanism. Here, a polar LiNbO3&#8208;type R3c phase of Bi1&#8208;xIn1+xO3 with x &#8776;0.15&#8211;0.24 is stabilized via epitaxial growth, which exhibits a bulk&#8208;Rashba effect with suppressed spin relaxation as a result of its unidirectional spin texture. As compared to the previously observed non&#8208;polar Pnma phase, this polar phase exhibits higher conductivity, reduced bandgap, and enhanced dielectric and piezoelectric responses. Combining first&#8208;principles calculations and multimodal magnetotransport measurements, which reveal weak (anti)localization, anisotropic magnetoresistance, planar&#8208;Hall effect, and nonreciprocal charge transport, a bulk&#8208;Rashba effect without rapid spin relaxation is demonstrated. These findings offer insights into spin&#8208;orbit coupling physics within polar oxides and suggest potential spintronic applications.

         <title>mTORC1 Selective Nano&#8208;Inhibitor by Disrupting the Lysosomal Arginine&#8208;SLC38A9&#8208; mTORC1&#8208;CDKs Axis for Precision Bladder Cancer Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
A strategy for mTORC1 specific nano&#8208;inhibitors targeting the lysosomal arginine&#8208;SLC38A9&#8208;mTORC1 pathway is presented. Using [2Fe&#8208;2S]CO6 as a paradigm, nanomedicines like ZnPc&#8208;SFeCO are developed. They degrade Arg in lysosome, inhibiting SLC38A9 and mTORC1.








Abstract
The absence of precise targeting and defined mechanisms, akin to small molecules, remains a major barrier to the clinical translation of nanomedicines. Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a key regulator of cell proliferation and metabolism, is linked to abnormal activation in various diseases like cancers. While small&#8208;molecule inhibitors of mTORC1 are limited, they remain a focus. Here, a strategy is presented for mTORC1&#8208;specific nano&#8208;inhibitors targeting the lysosomal arginine (Arg)&#8208;SLC38A9&#8208;mTORC1 pathway. Using [2Fe&#8208;2S]CO6 as a universal paradigm, nanomedicines are developed (e.g., ZnPc&#8208;SFeCO) that degrade Arg in the lysosome, inhibiting SLC38A9 activation and blocking mTORC1 recruitment. ZnPc&#8208;SFeCO inhibits mTORC1 at ultra&#8208;low concentrations (1.07 ng mL&#8722;1), with three orders of magnitude greater specificity than the clinical small molecule rapamycin. SLC38A9 knockout abolishes nanomedicine efficacy. Differential responses to the inhibitors are also observed in normal and bladder cancer cells, linked to SLC38A9 expression levels, suggesting potential for precise treatment of non&#8208;muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). In vivo, ZnPc&#8208;SFeCO combined with photodynamic therapy outperformed MMC in preventing tumor recurrence and extending survival. This work establishes a promising approach for developing mTORC1&#8208;specific nano&#8208;inhibitors with well&#8208;defined targets and mechanisms, offering new insights into the development of precision nanomedicines for cancer therapy.

         <title>In Situ Formation of Luminescent Perovskite Quantum Dot/Polymer Composites: Scalable Synthesis, Continuous Processing and Functional Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;free &#8220;raw material selection&#8208;synthesis design&#8208;product process (RSP)&#8221; strategy is proposed to in situ synthesize perovskite QD/polymer composites, which is conductive to scaling up perovskite QDs production from laboratory research to the market. This work establishes a comprehensive synthesis&#8208;process&#8208;application framework for perovskite QDs, paving the way for industrial production.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have been considered as new&#8208;generation emitters for light conversion fields, including X&#8208;ray imaging, displays, and wearable luminescent textiles. Especially when combined with polymers, perovskite QDs not only maintain superior luminance properties and exhibit exceptional stability, but also demonstrate remarkable processability.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have been considered as new-generation emitters for light conversion fields, including X-ray imaging, displays, and wearable luminescent textiles. Especially when combined with polymers, perovskite QDs not only maintain superior luminance properties and exhibit exceptional stability, but also demonstrate remarkable processability. However, there is still a lack of feasible strategies to achieve large-scale production of perovskite QD-based polymer composites. In this study, a solvent-free &#8220;raw material selection-synthesis design-product process (RSP)&#8221; strategy is proposed enable to continuously production of perovskite QD/polymer composites using a screw extruder. Rational raw material selection allows QDs to be uniformly dispersed within the polymer matrix, resulting in efficient luminescent features (e.g., the green CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; QD/PS composites with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of &#8776;90%). Meanwhile, polymer encapsulation obviously enhances the stability of QDs against the external environment. Importantly, the strategy is a continuous process (only raw material loading is required), which is conductive to scaling up perovskite QDs production from laboratory research to the market. Furthermore, the potential applications of as-prepared QD-based polymer composites is demonstrated in various light conversion fields, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), scintillators, displays, and luminescent textiles.

         <title>Reversible Thermochromic Organosilicon Fibers Based on TiO2@AgI Composites: Preparation, Properties, and Potential Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A medium&#8208;high temperature reversible thermochromic organosilicon fiber is prepared by a high&#8208;temperature air&#8208;induced crosslinking method, which has a large color difference (&#916;E = 25.72), excellent cyclic stability (170 times), and high sensitivity (135.4&#160;&#176;C). The fiber also combines high strength (9.89&#8211;11.33 MPa), durability (500 times), biocompatibility, and antimicrobial properties, and is suitable for use in the field of medium and high&#8208;temperature warning.








Abstract
The application of reversible thermochromic fibers (RTFs) is expanding from the smart wearable field toward industrial temperature detection and safety warning; however, most RTFs suffer from low color change temperature thresholds and poor thermal stability, which restrict their applications in medium and high&#8208;temperature places (&gt;100&#160;&#176;C). Currently, overheating of equipment is a key factor that causes safety accidents, and the development of reliable visualized temperature warning materials is of great practical significance for accident prevention. To address these issues, TiO2@AgI is blended with a ternary organosilicon oil spinning solution via a high&#8208;temperature air&#8208;induced crosslinking method to obtain a reversible thermochromic organosilicon fiber (TSiF) suitable for use in medium and high&#8208;temperature environments owing to its thermal stability. Among them, TiO&#8322;@AgI1.1@SiF&#8208;2 has the best performance, showing a significant white to bright yellow color change (color difference &#916;E = 25.72) at 135.4&#160;&#176;C. It still possesses the thermochromic performance after 170 cycles and excellent mechanical properties (tensile strength of 9.89&#8211;11.33&#160;MPa, no decay in 500 cycles), significant biocompatibility and antimicrobial ability, which fully meets the requirements for medium and high&#8208;temperature warning. Thus, this study provides a new idea for fabricating RTFs that can be used for medium and high&#8208;temperature warning.

         <title>Accompanying Structural Transformations in Polarity Switching of Heavily Doped Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polarity switching of heavily doped p&#8208;type conjugated polymers (CPs) toward environmentally stable electron&#8208;rich thin films is demonstrated. Multiscale analyses, incorporating spectroscopic, electrochemical, and scattering techniques, reveal structural and chemical transformations induced by excessive doping with AuCl3. Leveraging this polarity switching behavior, a flexible homojunction p&#8208;n diode is fabricated using a single CP&#8208;dopant system with a record&#8208;high rectification ratio of &#8776;105.








Abstract
Despite significant recent advancements in highly functional organic semiconductors (OSCs), the n&#8208;type OSCs reported to date lag behind their p&#8208;type counterparts in terms of long&#8208;term environmental stability. As an alternative approach to n&#8208;type materials, a few p&#8208;type polymers have been shown to undergo dramatic transitions in their charge carrier polarity to n&#8208;type through transition metal&#8208;incorporated Lewis acid doping. Although the concept of polarity switching is promising, its unclear chemical origin&#8212;particularly from a materials science perspective&#8212;limits its potential as an n&#8208;type counterpart. In this work, the chemical and structural mechanisms underlying the p&#8208;to&#8208;n polarity switching in a heavily doped conjugated polymer are elucidated. Using gold(III) chloride&#8208;doped indacenodithiophene&#8208;co&#8208;benzothiadiazole (IDTBT) as a model system, doping&#8208;induced thin&#8208;film structural changes are investigated. Quantitative X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of doped IDTBT films provides direct evidence of oxidation state changes in Au and Cl ions and confirms the covalent chlorination of the polymer backbone, establishing a direct correlation between the chemical doping mechanism and polarity switching. Finally, leveraging this polarity switching behavior, a p&#8208;n homojunction organic diode is demonstrated with a rectification ratio of 104&#8211;105, highlighting the versatility and potential of this excessively p&#8208;doped n&#8208;type OSC system for tailoring charge transport properties.

         <title>Unveiling Competitive Coordination in Aqueous Lithium&#8208;Ion Electrolytes through Solvent Descriptor Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work systematically establishes co&#8208;solvents selection criteria to achieve balanced solvation behavior by exploring the impacts of &#603; and &#181; on solvation structure. Cosolvent N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (DMAC) with moderate &#603; (&#603; = 37.8) and high &#181; (&#181; = 3.7 D), can counterbalance the fast diffusion capabilities of water molecules, thereby reducing the formation of by&#8208;products. The LDH&#8208;2 m electrolyte enables the suppressed HER and formation of an inorganic&#8208;rich electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface.








Abstract
The narrow electrochemical window and unstable hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) of aqueous electrolytes hinder the potential application of high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;ion batteries. These problems are actually related to the solvation structure of the electrolyte, which is determined by the competition among anions, water molecules, and cosolvent coordinated with Li+. Herein, this work proposes a direct solvent descriptor for conveniently designing electrolytes, which facilitates a pronounced level of Li+&#8208;TFSI&#8722; and Li+&#8208;DMAC coordination within the solvation sheath through synergistic effect of the dielectric constant and dipole moment. This strategy significantly reduces the involvement of water in the primary solvation shell and generates stable interfacial chemistry. Such an electrolyte regulated by competitive coordination leads to wide electrochemical stability window of 4.55 V and suppressed HER, thus realizing a 2.5 V LiMn2O4&#8208;Li4Ti5O12 full battery with the high discharge capacity of 138.4 mAh g&#8722;1 and average Coulombic efficiency of 99% over 1000 cycles at 3 C rate. The proposed strategy of solvation structure modification by regulating cation competitive coordination offers a promising approach for achieving stable aqueous batteries with high energy density.

         <title>Initiating Strain Field for Mitigating Lead Leakage in Perovskite Solar Cells with Built&#8208;in Encapsulating Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that chemical sealing networks and strain field regulation enhance the stability of perovskite film and inhibit Pb leakage, achieving a 96.98% suppression of Pb leakage. The small&#8208;area device (0.10 cm&#178;) and module (100 cm&#178;) exhibit the efficiencies of 26.11% and 20.41%, respectively. Unencapsulated devices retain 97.05% of their initial efficiency after 2160&#160;hours under the&#160;ambient humidity.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;This work demonstrates that chemical sealing networks and strain field regulation enhance the stability of perovskite film and inhibit Pb leakage, achieving a 96.98% suppression of Pb leakage. The small-area device (0.10 cm&#178;) and module (100 cm&#178;) exhibit the efficiencies of 26.11% and 20.41%, respectively. Unencapsulated devices retain 97.05% of their initial efficiency after 2160&#160;hours under the&#160;ambient humidity.

         <title>Structural Tuning Magnetism and Topology in a Magnetic Topological Insulator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This systematic study of magnetic topological matter under hydrostatic pressure reveals strong material response to pressure, demonstrating a shrinking topological gap and enhanced magnetic order under compression. These findings establish strain engineering as an effective tuning parameter for manipulating and potentially enhancing the quantum anomalous Hall effect.








Abstract
To date, the most widely&#8208;studied quantum anomalous Hall insulator (QAHI) platform is achieved by dilute doping of magnetic ions into thin films of the alloyed tetradymite topological insulator (TI) (Bi1 &#8722; xSbx)2Te3 (BST). In these films, long&#8208;range magnetic ordering of the transition metal substituants opens an exchange gap &#916; in the topological surface states, stabilizing spin&#8208;polarized, dissipationless edge channels with a nonzero Chern number C$\mathcal {C}$. The long&#8208;range ordering of the spatially separated magnetic ions is itself mediated by electronic states in the host TI, leading to a sophisticated feedback between magnetic and electronic properties. Here, a study is presented on the electronic and magnetic response of a BST&#8208;based QAHI system to structural tuning via hydrostatic pressure. A systematic closure of the topological gap under compressive strain is identified accompanied by a simultaneous enhancement in the magnetic ordering strength. Combining these experimental results with first&#8208;principle calculations, structural deformation is identified as a strong tuning parameter to traverse a rich topological phase space and modify magnetism in the magnetically doped BST&#160;system.

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Transient Unilateral Adhesive Recombinant Collagen&#8208;Based Hydrogel for Reversible Fibrosis Induction and Full&#8208;Cycle Management of Pancreatic Fistula</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;activated, injectable recombinant collagen&#8208;based hydrogel plug with targeted drug delivery is developed for full&#8208;cycle management of pancreatic fistula. Featuring enzyme resistance, transient unilateral adhesion, and reversible fibrosis induction, this hydrogel achieves 100% sealing efficiency and provides comprehensive therapeutic effects, including hemostasis, anti&#8208;inflammation, and reversible inhibition of exocrine function. This study pioneers the application of sequence&#8208;engineered recombinant collagen in pancreatic fistula treatment.








Abstract
Currently, no effective treatment for pancreatic fistula (PF) exists, which has a mortality rate &gt;40%. Existing protein&#8208;based physical barriers face the challenges of rapid degradation, lack of self&#8208;adhesiveness, and the inability to promote PF healing. To overcome this, a novel enzyme&#8208;resistant and highly bioactive hydrogel (CGO@Pg&#8208;Cu(II)) is developed using glycidyl methacrylate recombinant collagen (enzyme&#8208;cleavage&#8208;free) and oxidized pullulan as backbone molecules, which is further loaded with a penicillin G&#8208;Cu(II) infinite coordination polymer nanomedicine. This hydrogel can adapt to irregular PF wounds through injectable self&#8208;leveling and achieve transient unilateral adhesion via light&#8208;activated radical crosslinking with tissue&#8208;inherent molecules. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate its ability to provide full&#8208;cycle PF management by serving as a long&#8208;lasting physical barrier while offering antimicrobial properties, rapid hemostasis, anti&#8208;inflammatory effects, reversible fibrosis induction, and enhancing pancreatic tissue repair. The anti&#8208;PF efficacy of the CGO@Pg&#8208;Cu(II) hydrogel at day 7 is 100%, highlighting its strong potential for clinical postoperative PF prevention.

         <title>Synergistic Compound Additives for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite electrolyte with LiNO&#8323;, SAC, and OP&#8208;10 additives stabilizes lithium anodes and suppresses polysulfide shuttling in Li&#8211;S batteries. This strategy enables Li||Li symmetric cells to cycle under the challenging condition of 3 mAh cm&#8722;2 over 1400 h and enhances high&#8208;loading sulfur cathode performance, offering a promising electrolyte engineering approach for advanced metal&#8208;based energy storage systems.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, with theoretical energy densities exceeding 2600&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1, are poised to revolutionize energy storage. However, their practical viability hinges on resolving two critical challenges: uncontrolled lithium dendrite growth at the anode and polysulfide shuttling at the sulfur cathode. Here, a compound additive integrating lithium nitrate (LiNO3), sodium saccharin (SAC), and octaphenyl polyoxyethylene (OP&#8208;10) is proposed to construct an electrolyte for Li&#8211;S battery. With the compound additive added, the as&#8208;prepared electrolyte is capable of evolving a robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with refined morphology while suppressing polysulfide reactivity. The synergistic effects of this additive enable Li|Li symmetric cells to achieve unprecedented cycling stability (&gt;1400 h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 3 mAh cm&#8722;2) and Li&#8211;S full cells with high sulfur loading (4.12&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) to retain 2.72 mAh cm&#8722;2 after 150 cycles. This work underscores the importance of dual&#8208;electrode stabilization in electrolyte design, offering a scalable strategy for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8211;S batteries and related systems plagued by dendrites and shuttle effects. This study highlights the effectiveness of synergistic electrolyte engineering in suppressing lithium dendrites and polysulfide shuttling, providing new insights for the development of high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S batteries and other energy storage systems facing similar challenges.

         <title>Synthesis and Electrochemistry of Stacking Fault&#8208;Free &#946;&#8208;NaMnO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inherent tendency to form intergrown stacking faults in corrugated layered &#946;&#8208;NaMnO2 hinders the understanding of its structural transition during electrochemical reaction. The synthesis of fault&#8208;free &#946;&#8208;NaMnO2 unveils in&#8208;plane sliding of corrugated MnO2 as well as excellent capacity retention in Na cells, providing a strategy to exploit Mn&#8208;based layered oxides for long&#8208;life Na&#8208;ion batteries.









Abstract
Understanding the solid&#8208;state chemistry of corrugated layered sodium manganese oxide (&#946;&#8208;NaMnO2) has been hindered by stacking faults (SFs), particularly in the presence of &#945;&#8208;type planar domains among &#946;&#8208;type corrugated MnO2 layers. Thus, their prospects as cathode materials for Na&#8208;ion batteries have never been assessed comprehensively. The partial substitution of Cu for the Mn in &#946;&#8208;NaMnO2 yields SF&#8208;free &#946;&#8208;phase, as confirmed via atomic scale scanning transmission electron microscopy. The SF&#8208;free material enables the identification of unique phase transitions during electrochemical Na extraction/insertion, showing drastic gliding of the corrugated layers. The proposed gliding mechanism is validated both experimentally, using ex situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, and theoretically, through density functional theory calculations. Minor structural changes observed in SF&#8208;containing materials indicated that gliding is extremely sensitive to SFs. Given that the SF&#8208;free &#946;&#8208;material exhibits excellent cycle stability in a Na cell, the corrugated layer is concluded to have high resilience and reversibility against repeated large anisotropic structural changes involving slab gliding, providing a new insight into the design of long&#8208;life rechargeable batteries.

&lt;p&gt;An inherent tendency to form intergrown stacking faults in corrugated layered &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-NaMnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hinders the understanding of its structural transition during electrochemical reaction. The synthesis of fault-free &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-NaMnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; unveils in-plane sliding of corrugated MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as well as excellent capacity retention in Na cells, providing a strategy to exploit Mn-based layered oxides for long-life Na-ion batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the solid-state chemistry of corrugated layered sodium manganese oxide (&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-NaMnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) has been hindered by stacking faults (SFs), particularly in the presence of &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-type planar domains among &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-type corrugated MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layers. Thus, their prospects as cathode materials for Na-ion batteries have never been assessed comprehensively. The partial substitution of Cu for the Mn in &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-NaMnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yields SF-free &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-phase, as confirmed via atomic scale scanning transmission electron microscopy. The SF-free material enables the identification of unique phase transitions during electrochemical Na extraction/insertion, showing drastic gliding of the corrugated layers. The proposed gliding mechanism is validated both experimentally, using ex situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction, and theoretically, through density functional theory calculations. Minor structural changes observed in SF-containing materials indicated that gliding is extremely sensitive to SFs. Given that the SF-free &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-material exhibits excellent cycle stability in a Na cell, the corrugated layer is concluded to have high resilience and reversibility against repeated large anisotropic structural changes involving slab gliding, providing a new insight into the design of long-life rechargeable batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transparent Anti&#8208;Icing Moir&#233;&#8208;Film Enhancing Photovoltaic Stability in Extreme Cold Climates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving effective de&#8208;icing without sacrificing photovoltaic efficiency remains challenging. A scalable, transparent photothermal film is developed with moir&#233; structures that enable efficient ice removal and restore winter solar output. Under snow&#8208;covered conditions, it achieves up to a 7.5&#8208;fold increase in daily power generation.








Abstract
Accelerated degradation and power loss of solar cells in cold climates remain major challenges to renewable energy deployment. The photothermal film offers a promising solution by converting sunlight into heat to remove ice and snow from solar panels. However, enhancing photothermal performance often entails reduced visible (VIS) light transmittance of films, thereby compromising solar cell efficiency. Tailoring optical designs to balance the optimal light absorption between the device and the film is essential for photovoltaic anti&#8208;icing/snow. Herein, we present outdoor data from grid&#8208;connected photovoltaic modules, revealing a 58% electricity loss caused by ice/snow shading effects. To address this, we developed transparent photothermal films featuring a moir&#233; light&#8208;trapping structure, achieving high VIS transmittance (&#8764;93.0%) and enhanced near&#8208;infrared absorption (&#8764;65.8%). We confirmed that the meter&#8208;scale photothermal film ensures that operational modules remain ice&#8208;free in &#8722;20 &#176;C outdoor conditions, and the ice&#8208;melting phase diagram indicates its effective anti&#8208;icing range down to &#8722;30 &#176;C under AM 1.5G, one&#8208;sun illumination. Day&#8208;night cycling tests on perovskite cells demonstrated sustained anti&#8208;icing performance, yielding a 7.5&#8208;fold increase in daily power output during winter conditions. The film's long&#8208;term stability and robust de&#8208;icing performance under weak&#8208;light scenarios demonstrate the its feasibility for extreme cold applications.

         <title>Dual Roles of Deep Eutectic Solvent in Polysulfide Redox and Catalysis for Intermediate&#8208;Temperature Potassium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>

A dual&#8208;functional NiS&#8208;DES interfacial strategy enables highly reversible K2S2/K2S conversion in intermediate&#8208;temperature K&#8208;S batteries by balancing adsorption and activation of intermediates at the catalytic interface, achieving high capacity, long cycle life, and low&#8208;cost energy storage.








Abstract
Potassium&#8211;sulfur (K&#8208;S) batteries hold great promise for long&#8208;duration energy storage due to their low cost and high energy density. However, the irreversible deposition of K2S2/K2S severely hinders sulfur utilization and cycling stability. Herein, a NiS&#8211;DES interfacial regulation strategy is developed that leverages the dual functionality of a deep eutectic solvent (DES) to govern the adsorption and conversion behavior of K2S2/K2S at the catalytic interface, enabling their highly reversible transformation. Specifically, DES forms moderate electronic coupling with NiS to weaken the excessively strong adsorption of K2S and prevent catalyst deactivation. Simultaneously, strong electronic interactions between DES and K2S promote interfacial activation and conversion, thereby extending the reaction pathway and enhancing reduction depth. As a result, the intermediate&#8208;temperature K&#8208;S batteries deliver an initial capacity of 810 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 with a minimal capacity decay of 0.02%/cycle over 1300 cycles at 6&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2 sulfur loading. Even under lean catholyte (4.2 &#181;L&#160;mg[sulfur]&#8722;1) and higher sulfur loading (12&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2), they achieve 521 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 initially, retaining stability with 0.03%/cycle decay over 500 cycles. This NiS&#8208;30DES system achieves a cell&#8208;level energy density exceeding 150&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 and a low levelized cost of storage (LCOS) of $140/MWh, demonstrating strong potential for scalable long&#8208;duration energy storage.

         <title>Revisiting the Impact of Anion Selection on Sulfur Redox Reaction Kinetics for High Sulfur Loading Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>

Sulfur redox reactions are systematically evaluated with nine commercial lithium salts and developed a new LiTFSI&#8208;free, PFAS&#8208;free electrolyte for Li&#8211;S batteries. LiBOB, once considered incompatible, forms a stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase, suppressing the shuttle effect and delivering excellent performance in high&#8208;loading Li&#8211;S cells, offering a more sustainable electrolyte strategy.








Abstract
Lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) is widely used in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery electrolytes due to its stability with lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and moderate compatibility with lithium metal anodes. However, LiTFSI presents environmental concerns due to its association with per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are environmentally persistent and potentially toxic, raises sustainability concerns. This research also reveals that LiTFSI limits sulfur redox reactions (SRRs), making it less effective than other lithium salts.&#160;Additionally, some salts previously considered incompatible with Li&#8208;S systems due to their reactivity with LiPSs are demonstrated to perform effectively. For the first time, a protective, porous cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) formed in situ through reactions between salt anions and LiPS is reported. The cells delivered a high specific capacity of 1230.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.05 C with a sulfur loading of &#8776;6&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, limited lithium anode, maintaining a capacity retention of 76.2% after 100 cycles at 0.1 C. Under harsh conditions, such as high sulfur loading, lean electrolyte conditions (3 &#181;L mg&#8722;1), and in anode&#8208;free cells, the cells continued to deliver outstanding capacity. This work provides valuable guidelines for understanding and selecting lithium salts to advance electrolyte design for Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Highly&#8208;Sensitive Implantable NIR Phototransistor for One&#8208;Click Pain Relief Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic near&#8208;inflared phototransistors with IDTBT/Y6 heterojunction are developed as implantable controllers for alternating voltages triggering, and shows 99.4% suppression rate within 20&#160;ms on rat, enabling real&#8208;time pain relief for medical application advancing.








Abstract
The increasing prevalence of chronic neuralgic pain in expanding populations has created urgent demands for robust pain relief technology. Their sporadic and unpredictable nature, however, presents significant challenge for on&#8208;demand inhibition of nerve transduction. Here, implantable near&#8208;infrared pain relief controllers are reported that leverage stretchable organic phototransistors with IDTBT/Y6 bulk&#8208;heterojunction, offering high responsiveness and reduce charge trapping to trigger detectivity of up to 9.4 &#215; 1013 Jones. By integrating the device with an oscillating circuit, the 808&#160;nm NIR irradiation with varying light intensities can trigger inhibiting voltage ranging from 1&#160;kHz to 50&#160;kHz. This allows for one&#8208;click precise manipulation of neural activity in rat sciatic nerves, achieving up to 99.4% signal suppression within just 20 milliseconds. Furthermore, the nearly real&#8208;time elimination of pain sensation is confirmed by measuring the amplitude of hind paw reflex movements of rats.

&lt;p&gt;Organic near-inflared phototransistors with IDTBT/Y6 heterojunction are developed as implantable controllers for alternating voltages triggering, and shows 99.4% suppression rate within 20&#160;ms on rat, enabling real-time pain relief for medical application advancing.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increasing prevalence of chronic neuralgic pain in expanding populations has created urgent demands for robust pain relief technology. Their sporadic and unpredictable nature, however, presents significant challenge for on-demand inhibition of nerve transduction. Here, implantable near-infrared pain relief controllers are reported that leverage stretchable organic phototransistors with IDTBT/Y6 bulk-heterojunction, offering high responsiveness and reduce charge trapping to trigger detectivity of up to 9.4 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Jones. By integrating the device with an oscillating circuit, the 808&#160;nm NIR irradiation with varying light intensities can trigger inhibiting voltage ranging from 1&#160;kHz to 50&#160;kHz. This allows for one-click precise manipulation of neural activity in rat sciatic nerves, achieving up to 99.4% signal suppression within just 20 milliseconds. Furthermore, the nearly real-time elimination of pain sensation is confirmed by measuring the amplitude of hind paw reflex movements of rats. These findings pave a novel way for the development of advanced pain relief systems for medical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailored Heterogeneous Interphase Layer Promotes Low&#8208;Temperature Desolvation Toward Durable Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterogeneous artificial interphase is constructed to stabilize sodium metal anodes at subzero temperatures. The tailored sodiophilic interface facilitates Na+ desolvation and regulates uniform deposition, effectively suppressing dendrite formation even at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. This work offers a practical strategy to enhance interfacial stability and electrochemical performance of low&#8208;temperature sodium metal batteries.









Abstract
Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) represent a promising next&#8208;generation energy storage technology due to their low cost and high energy density. However, SMBs face significant challenges, including interfacial instability and the growth of sodium dendrites on the metal anode, particularly at low temperatures (LTs). Poor ion desolvation at LTs further exacerbates these issues, severely compromising battery performance. To address these problems, a heterogeneous artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) composed of Na3VO4 and metallic In (NVO&#8208;In@Na) is designed for LT SMBs. The sodiophilic Na3VO4 promotes sodium ion adsorption, while the Na2In phase formed during the initial plating enhances ion transport kinetics, resulting in uniform Na deposition behavior. Theory calculations indicate that the Na3VO4/Na2In interface accelerates charge transfer processes and desolvation. The engineered NVO&#8208;In@Na anode demonstrates exceptional stability: symmetric cells operate for over 2000 h at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2/1 mAh cm&#8722;2 under ambient conditions and exceed 1100 h at 0.1 mA cm&#8722;2/0.1 mAh cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;40 &#176;C. Full cells paired with Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode retain 97% capacity after 1150 cycles at 0.5 C and &#8722;40 &#176;C. This work highlights the potential of rational SEI design to overcome critical limitations of SMBs, advancing high&#8208;performance energy storage under extreme conditions.

         <title>Subsurface Electron Trap Enabled Long&#8208;Cycling Oxalate&#8208;Based Li&#8208;CO2 Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates the subsurface electron confinement in Mo&#8208;based catalysts by incorporating electron&#8208;deficient boron atoms as subsurface traps. This design elevates the Mo d&#8208;band and intensifies Mo&#8211;O orbital hybridization, stabilizing lithium oxalate while suppressing the formation of lithium carbonate. Consequently, the Li&#8208;CO2 batteries exhibit unprecedented efficiencies and cycling stabilities at extreme temperatures.








Abstract
Li&#8208;CO&#8322; batteries promise ultrahigh theoretical energy densities but face efficiency limitations owing to the sluggish decomposition of stable Li2CO3. Redirecting the redox pathway toward Li2C2O4 overcomes this challenge, but its metastability leads to facile conversion to Li2CO3 during discharge. Herein, subsurface electronic confinement is engineered in Mo&#8208;based catalysts, leveraging electron&#8208;deficient boron (B) as electron traps in the subsurface atomic layers to tailor their interfacial electronic landscapes. This design elevates the Mo d&#8208;band and intensifies the hybridization between the Mo d&#8208;orbitals and O p&#8208;orbitals of oxalate. Strengthening the Mo&#8208;O interaction stabilizes Li2C2O4 against decomposition. The highly reversible and stable redox chemistry enabled by MoB results in an exceptional cycling stability and energy efficiency across a wide temperature range, with an expanded practical viability. At 70&#160;&#181;A cm&#8722;2, the MoB&#8208;based battery is cycled for &gt;1400&#160;h with a high energy efficiency of &gt;85%. The energy efficiency even remains at &gt;90% for &#8776;150&#160;h at a high temperature (90&#160;&#176;C). This study pioneers a material design framework for use in stabilizing metastable products within Li&#8208;CO2 batteries, advancing their applicabilities in extreme environments, such as deep&#8208;earth exploration, by revealing the role of subsurface charge redistribution in steering reaction pathways.

         <title>Calcium&#8208;Based Bifunctional Lewis Acid&#8208;Base Sites Induce the Directional Generation of Radical in Catalytic Ozonation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This bifunctional catalyst synergizes Ca&#9472;O alkaline sites (boosting &#183;OH generation) and Ca&#9472;O&#9472;Si acidic centers (dominate the generation of &#183;O2&#8208;), establishing a selective radical generation pathway and achieving &gt;99.9% removal of refractory pollutants (oxalic acid, atrazine) in 30 min with 3&#8208;230&#8208;fold enhancements over conventional AOPs. This work offers a molecular&#8208;scale blueprint for directional ROS control in wastewater treatment.








Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediate critical redox processes in contaminant degradation, precise regulation of radical speciation remains fundamentally constrained by the heterogeneity in active site configurations and coordination microenvironments. Here, a site&#8208;specific engineering strategy is demonstrated through spatially organized Ca&#9472;O basic sites and Ca&#9472;O&#9472;Si acidic centers, fabricated via Ca2+&#8208;mediated cross&#8208;linking of sodium alginate. Mechanistic studies reveal that the alkaline Ca&#9472;O domains enhance spin density of *OO intermediates to promote hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH) generation, while adjacent acidic Ca&#9472;O&#9472;Si moieties simultaneously lower *O formation energy barrier and suppress *OO conversion, establishing a selective radical generation pathway. This bifunctional design achieves near&#8208;complete removal (&gt;99.9%) of recalcitrant pollutants including oxalic acid and atrazine within 30&#160;min, demonstrating 3&#8208;230&#8208;fold rate enhancement over conventional advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). The engineered catalyst maintains stable efficiency over 20 cycles in actual wastewater treatment processes, providing a molecular&#8208;scale blueprint for directional ROS manipulation in water treatment.

         <dc:description>
A migratory animal&#8208;enlightened hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework nanorods electrodeposited nickel&#8208;based fabric is designed as an ultrafast and ultrasensitive dual&#8208;environmental magnetic field luminescent sensor both in air and water, which can be further utilized for underwater magnetic wireless communication, motion perception, and air&#8208;underwater dual&#8208;environment magnetic intelligent real&#8208;time monitoring, providing a sufficient basis for the future application of luminescent magnetic sensors in the field of wireless communication, magnetic navigation, medical diagnosis, resource exploration, traffic engineering and environmental protection, etc.








Abstract
Migratory animals with magnetic receptors can sense the Earth's magnetic field, a phenomenon known as magnetoreception, and use it for long&#8208;distance navigation. Nevertheless, research on flexible luminescent magnetic sensors, particularly those suitable for both aerial and underwater environments, remains extremely underdeveloped.

     alt="Migratory Animals-Enlightened Hydrogen-Bonded Organic Framework Nanorods Electrodeposited Nickel-Based Fabrics for Ultrafast and Ultrasensitive Dual-Environmental Magnetic Field Luminescence Responsive Monitoring Both in Air and Water"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A migratory animal-enlightened hydrogen-bonded organic framework nanorods electrodeposited nickel-based fabric is designed as an ultrafast and ultrasensitive dual-environmental magnetic field luminescent sensor both in air and water, which can be further utilized for underwater magnetic wireless communication, motion perception, and air-underwater dual-environment magnetic intelligent real-time monitoring, providing a sufficient basis for the future application of luminescent magnetic sensors in the field of wireless communication, magnetic navigation, medical diagnosis, resource exploration, traffic engineering and environmental protection, etc.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Migratory animals with magnetic receptors can sense the Earth's magnetic field, a phenomenon known as magnetoreception, and use it for long-distance navigation. Nevertheless, research on flexible luminescent magnetic sensors, particularly those suitable for both aerial and underwater environments, remains extremely underdeveloped. Herein, enlightened by the magnetic perception ability of migratory animals, an air and underwater dual-environment bionic luminescent magnetic sensor (HOF-14@Ni fabric) is initiatively fabricated by electroplating hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOF-14) onto nickel-based conductive fabric via a coordinated electrodeposition method. In both air and underwater environments, HOF-14@Ni fabric exhibits ultrafast response speed (40 and 240 ms), ultralow detection limit (0.0227 and 0.0337 mT), ultrahigh sensitivity (1510.23 and 51.89 T&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), ultrahigh measurement accuracy (relative standard deviation &#8804; 0.52% and 0.097%), and great repeatability (900 and 540 cycles), respectively. Finite element simulation analysis of displacement and magnetic flux density changes for HOF-14@Ni fabric reveals that the magnetic response mechanism can be attributed to the magnetic-caused bending behavior resulting from magnetic attraction. Additionally, underwater magnetic wireless communication, motion perception, and air-underwater dual-environment magnetic intelligent real-time monitoring are further materialized. This work opens up a brand-new path for the application of luminescent (fluorescent) sensors in the field of dual-environment magnetic sensing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Valence and Site Engineering Enable Efficient Broadband Near&#8208;Infrared Emission at 960 nm in Cr3+&#8208;Activated Forsterite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescent material (Mg2SiO4:1.5%Cr,5%Li) with efficient (EQE = 48%) ultra&#8208;broadband (FWHM &#8776; 2413 cm&#8722;1 (226&#160;nm)) NIR emission at 960&#160;nm upon blue&#8208;light excitation. This innovation addresses the low efficiency of long&#8208;wavelength (&#955;max &gt; 900&#160;nm) NIR&#8208;emitting materials due to the radiationless de&#8208;activation and the low absorption efficiency of Cr3+ activators.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light sources hold great potential for applications in night vision illumination, bio&#8208;imaging, and non&#8208;destructive testing. However, radiationless de&#8208;activation and low absorption restrict the development of high&#8208;efficiency blue light excitable NIR phosphors, especially for emissions beyond 900&#160;nm. Herein we report a high&#8208;performance Cr3+&#8208;activated forsterite (Mg2SiO4:1.5%Cr3+, 5%Li+) phosphor exhibiting broadband NIR emission peaking at 960&#160;nm with a record external quantum efficiency (EQE) up to 48%. The introduction of Li+ as a charge compensator and symmetry distorter not only suppresses Cr4+ formation but also enhances the cross section of Cr3+ d&#8208;d forbidden transitions in Mg2SiO4. More importantly, Li+ promotes excited&#8208;state energy transfer between Cr3+ emitters, yielding exceptional thermal stability and external quantum efficiency. A fabricated NIR phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) achieved a NIR radiated power of 356&#160;mW (at a driving current of 700&#160;mA) and an electro&#8208;optical conversion efficiency up to 12.9% (at 100&#160;mA). This work unlocks new possibilities for smart spectroscopy applications, from non&#8208;destructive testing to human angiography and biometric recognition.

         <title>Polarization Signal Amplification of 2D GeSe&#8208;Based Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal field&#8208;effect transistor&#8208;based amplification circuit is developed to significantly enhance the polarization ratio (PR) of 2D GeSe polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors, improving PR from 2.1 to 54.8 (over 25&#8208;fold enhancement). This amplified polarization signal directly contributes to higher recognition accuracy in defect detection systems, concurrently reducing the computational costs of convolutional neural networks (CNN)&#160;by over 60%.








Abstract
Polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors, resolving light intensity, wavelength, and polarization states, enable the characterization of probing microstructure, internal stress, and compositional heterogeneity. Polarizer&#8208;free polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors based on in&#8208;plane anisotropic 2D semiconductors offer potential for device miniaturization and on&#8208;chip integration, owing to their inherent linear dichroism and orientation&#8208;dependent carrier mobilities. Hundreds of in&#8208;plane anisotropic 2D materials have been successfully discovered; however, the limited anisotropic photocurrent ratio (PR&lt;10) has hindered the practical application. Herein, a field&#8208;effect transistor (FET)&#8208;based amplification strategy, enhancing PR from 2.1 to 54.8 in 2D GeSe photodetectors is proposed. This significant PR enhancement arises from polarization&#8208;induced resistance variations dynamically modulating gate potentials. Coupled with a steep transistor subthreshold region, small gate fluctuations produce substantial drain current changes, amplifying output anisotropy sensitively. Evaluating four types of FET identifies SMT&#8208;Si transistors as optimal due to their high stability, sharp subthreshold, and excellent noise immunity. In addition, the amplified PR signal directly enhances image contrast and recognition accuracy. Notably, with a high&#8208;PR signal, the machine learning model achieves a recognition rate of 0.99 in only 17 training epochs, reflecting a computational cost reduction of over 60%. This work provides an effective strategy to enhance PR, benefiting from high&#8208;resolution polarization imaging and advanced optoelectronic sensing.

         <title>Photocatalytic Aqueous Reforming of Methyl Formate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3d&#8208;metal Cu&#8208;based atomically dispersed photocatalyst, supported on modified g&#8208;C&#8323;N&#8324;, facilitates the photocatalytic selective hydrogen (7.5 mmol gcat&#8722;1 of hydrogen; nothing else than H2 and CO2) generation from methyl formate. This diverse system functions under mild conditions, providing high hydrogen yield, selectivity, and enduring stability. Through characterization and mechanistic investigations uncover a radical approach, offering a sustainable foundation for the future advancement of liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC) technologies utilizing earth&#8208;abundant metals.








Abstract
Green hydrogen is critical to establish a sustainable energy future as it offers a clean, renewable, and a versatile alternative for decarbonizing industries, transportation, and power generation. However, the limitations of current methods significantly restrict the scope and hinder many of the envisioned applications. This study aims to report on the first example of a 3d&#8208;metal&#8208;based (Cu) heterogeneous photocatalytic system to produce green hydrogen via dehydrogenation of methyl formate (MF), a reaction previously known to require 4d/5d transition metals. Employing a Cu&#8208;based atomically dispersed heterogeneous photocatalyst supported on aryl&#8208;amino&#8208;substituted graphitic carbon nitride (d&#8208;gC3N4), the protocol offers numerous key advantages, including the recyclability of the photocatalyst for &gt;10 cycles without significant activity loss, sustained hydrogen production (&gt;15 days!) with high hydrogen yield (19.8 mmol gcat&#8722;1) and negligible CO emission, following an operationally simple, sustainable, and efficient catalytic pathway. Furthermore, the photocatalyst is characterized (using HAADF&#8208;STEM, SS&#8208;NMR, XAS, EPR, and XPS), all of which clearly demonstrated the presence of single atomic Cu&#8208;site. Additionally, comprehensive mechanistic investigations together with DFT calculations allow for a thorough mechanistic rationale for this reaction. It is strongly believed that this atomically dispersed heterogeneous photocatalytic approach will open new avenues for establishing liquid organic hydrogen career (LOHC) technologies.

         <title>Switching off Competing Hydrogen Formation in CO2 Electroreduction via Substrate Defect Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that graphitized carbon nanotubes enhance the selectivity of Ni phthalocyanine catalysts for CO2 reduction by preserving the Ni&#8208;N4 coordination structure. In situ spectroscopy and Density Functional Theory confirm that defect engineering suppresses hydrogen evolution. The findings highlight a cost&#8208;effective strategy for scalable, selective CO production using immobilized molecular catalysts.








Abstract
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are widely used as supports for immobilizing molecular electrocatalysts, such as for CO2 reduction (CO2R), with &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions often assumed to govern the catalyst immobilization. However, the nature of catalyst/CNTs interactions remains insufficiently understood. Here, nickel phthalocyanine (NiPc) is investigated, a benchmark CO2R catalyst, supported on CNTs. NiPc preferentially anchors at defect&#8208;sites on CNTs rather than adsorbing uniformly via &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking is found, an observation validated by theoretical simulations. Notably, CNTs with the fewest defects, despite exhibiting non&#8208;uniform NiPc distribution, deliver the highest CO2R activity and CO selectivity. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveals that high defect densities induce D4h symmetry distortion of the NiPc macrocycle under cathodic bias, compromising catalyst integrity and CO2R performance. Guided by these insights, CNT defect density is optimized via thermal graphitization, yielding a NiPc/CNT composite with unprecedented selectivity (CO:H2 &gt; 16&#160;100:1) and a turnover frequency of 1072&#160;s&#8315;1 at &#8722;0.60&#160;V versus RHE, switching off the competing hydrogen formation. Integrated into a 100&#160;cm2 zero&#8208;gap electrolyzer, the optimized catalyst sustains 50&#160;A current with &gt;95% CO selectivity at &#8776;3.5&#160;V, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Ag&#8208;based systems. This work establishes CNT defect&#8208;engineering as an effective strategy for advancing molecular catalysts for CO2R electrolysis.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature Enhancing Triboelectric Nanogenerator Based on Antioxidant Liquid Crystalline Polyarylate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;temperature enhancing triboelectric nanogenerator (HTE&#8208;TENG) based on antioxidant liquid crystalline polyarylate (LCP), the highly rigid main chain of which endows TENG with excellent heat resistance. The resultant HTE&#8208;TENG provides a sustainable route for reliable energy devices and electronics to save lives in potential applications, such as rescue work, personal protection, and extreme environments.








Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is a prospective energy harvesting technology, especially polymer&#8208;based TENG has achieved remarkable achievements. However, most polymer&#8208;based triboelectric layers suffer serious structural degradation and rapid decrease of charge density at high temperatures, which severely lowers the power supply capacity of TENG and definitely limits their applications in extreme environments. Herein, the antioxidants are introduced into liquid crystalline polyarylate (LCP) to fabricate thermally stable TENG and enhance its thermal oxidation resistance. The peak voltage of the resultant TENG is boosted to 73.6 V at 200&#160;&#176;C, which is 144.1% higher than the value at 25&#160;&#176;C, indicating the remarkably high&#8208;temperature enhancing effect on electrical output performance. Meanwhile, the high&#8208;temperature enhancing TENG (HTE&#8208;TENG) exhibited a peak output electrical power density of 1071.3 mW&#183;m&#8722;2 under a 109 &#937; load. This work provides a sustainable route for reliable energy devices and electronics to serve in potential applications, such as rescue work, personal protection, and extreme environments.

         <title>Realizing Multicolor, 3D&#8208;Printable Ultralong Room Temperature Phosphorescence PLA Materials via Regulating the &#960;&#8208;System of Aryl&#8208;Annulated Carbazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By regulating the &#960;&#8208; system of aryl&#8208;annulated carbazoles, full&#8208;color (440 &#8211; 628 nm) is achieved, ultralong lifetimes (251 &#8211; 3841 ms), and bright (&#934;pmax = 19%) RTP emission in PLA matrix, representing the best performance among reported PLA&#8208;based RTP materials. Leveraging the unique thermoplasticity of polymers, versatile RTP filaments are fabricated through extrusion processing and create intricate RTP objects via FDM printing or 3D printing pens.








Abstract
Bio&#8208;based degradable organic ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (URTP) polymers should become a mainstream research topic in the future. Meanwhile, shaping URTP polymers into 3D&#8208;printable materials is of great significance for applications in optical and optoelectronic fields. Nevertheless, the fabrication of full&#8208;color, ultralong, bright, and 3D printable bio&#8208;based RTP polymer materials using a single&#8208;dopant component still faces significant challenges. Here, by regulating the &#960;&#8208;system of aryl&#8208;annulated carbazoles, the triplet energy levels are successfully regulated which enabled wavelength&#8208;tunable RTP emissions spanning from blue to red afterglow (440 &#8211; 628 nm) in PLA matrix. Non&#8208;radiative decay of dopant triplet excitons are effectively suppressed by the rigid environment of polymer matrix and dopant&#8208;polymer interactions. This enables the prepared PLA&#8208;based RTP materials exhibited ultralong lifetimes of 3.84 s and the naked&#8208;eye&#8208;visible afterglow duration up to 48 s. Recyclable and reprocessable RTP objects are fabricated via 3D printing and are successfully applied in the fields of artworks, monitoring and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. This successfully expands the application of polymer&#8208;based RTP materials in 3D fields, and will promote the commercialization of RTP materials and the development of environmentally friendly ultralong RTP materials.

         <title>Contact Transfer Epitaxy of Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bringing a halide perovskite thin film (donor) into contact with a self&#8208;assembled monolayer of oriented perovskite nanocrystals (acceptor) at elevated temperature leads to epitaxial transfer of halide perovskite from the donor to the acceptor substrate. The acceptor substrate controls the crystal orientation and grain size, while the donor substrate controls the composition.








Abstract
Halide perovskite materials are very exciting because of their excellent optoelectronic properties and simple deposition with both solution and vapor&#8208;phase methods. Until now, solution deposition has received more attention, but there are growing indications that residual solvent may limit performance and in particular long&#8208;term stability. Evaporation is a promising alternative, but is more complicated to implement; it requires vacuum, multiple sources at different temperatures, is difficult to switch between different materials due to cross&#8208;contamination and typically leads to films with very small grain size. Here a novel contact transfer method is presented for fabricating single crystalline perovskites that maintains the simplicity and flexibility of solution deposition while avoiding the use of solvent. This contact transfer epitaxy method uses an acceptor substrate consisting of self&#8208;assembled perovskite nanocubes to control crystal orientation and a donor substrate of the desired perovskite film to determine the ultimate composition. By heating the two substrates under close contact in atmospheric conditions, the perovskite film is transferred from the donor to the acceptor substrate, showing cubic phase (100) orientation even with hexagonal donor films. It is shown that contact transfer epitaxy is compatible with a variety of compositions and does not require specialized evaporators or vacuum conditions.

         <title>Development of a Vaginal Extracellular Matrix Hydrogel for Combating Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a vaginal specific ECM hydrogel (vECM) is developed, optimized for intravaginal topical administration, and evaluated for mitigatation of vaginal atrophy associated with menopause. When applied in a rat model of menopause, vECM improves vaginal epithelial thickness and stem cell phenotype, and despite topical application, vECM also exerts a regenerative effect on the deeper smooth muscle layer.








Abstract
Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) is initiated by the hypoestrogenic state consequent to cessation of ovarian function and involves changes in all vaginal layers.

&lt;p&gt;In this study, a vaginal specific ECM hydrogel (vECM) is developed, optimized for intravaginal topical administration, and evaluated for mitigatation of vaginal atrophy associated with menopause. When applied in a rat model of menopause, vECM improves vaginal epithelial thickness and stem cell phenotype, and despite topical application, vECM also exerts a regenerative effect on the deeper smooth muscle layer.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) is initiated by the hypoestrogenic state consequent to cessation of ovarian function and involves changes in all vaginal layers. These alterations include decreased epithelial proliferation and differentiation, impaired extracellular matrix (ECM) maintenance, pro-inflammatory immune milieu, and smooth muscle atrophy. Patient satisfaction with existing treatments for GSM is low, due in part to their lack of therapeutic effect throughout all vaginal layers and reliance on hormonal treatments. Decellularized ECM therapeutics are known to facilitate soft tissue repair in a variety of applications. Thus, a porcine vaginal tissue-derived decellularized ECM (vECM) hydrogel suitable for noninvasive topical intravaginal administration is developed specifically for vaginal repair. When applied in a rat model of surgical menopause, vECM significantly improves vaginal epithelial thickness and epithelial stem cell phenotype. Despite topical intravaginal application, vECM is also observed in the lamina propria and fibromuscularis, exerting a regenerative effect on the vaginal smooth muscle layer. Furthermore, vECM modulates macrophage density and promotes pro-regenerative M2-like phenotype within the vaginal tissue. Overall, the work herein demonstrates a new nonhormonal biomaterial treatment that counteracts pathological vaginal alterations &#8211; a hallmark of GSM &#8211; in an established preclinical model of menopause.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Fast Microwave&#8208;Assisted Volumetric Heating Engineered Defect&#8208;Free Ceria/Zirconia Bilayer Electrolytes for Solid Oxide Electrochemical Cells</title>

This study proposes a transformative approach for fabricating highly dense and thin ceria/zirconia bilayer electrolytes for solid oxide electrochemical cells using microwave&#8208;assisted volumetric sintering at unprecedentedly low temperatures and short processing times, achieving excellent performance and durability.








Abstract
Solid oxide electrochemical cells (SOCs) hold significant promise as a sustainable energy conversion technology due to their high efficiency and minimal environmental impact. However, their development faces critical challenges, particularly in achieving dense ceria/zirconia bilayer electrolytes necessary to fully leverage state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art cobaltite&#8208;based oxygen electrodes. In this study, a microwave&#8208;assisted volumetric sintering process is successfully employed as a transformative alternative to the conventional, time&#8208;intensive sintering approach, enabling the fabrication of highly dense ceria/zirconia bilayer electrolytes. This innovative method reduced processing time by over 30&#8208;fold compared to convection sintering and achieved a record&#8208;low sintering temperature of 1200&#160;&#176;C. SOCs fabricated with these volumetric heating&#8208;engineered bilayer electrolytes demonstrated outstanding electrochemical performance, delivering a maximum power density of 2.43&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 700&#160;&#176;C in fuel cell mode and a current density of 3.16&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 750&#160;&#176;C in electrolysis mode, alongside excellent long&#8208;term durability. Furthermore, advanced digital twin analysis revealed the critical correlation between microstructural features and electrochemical performance, providing new insights into SOC optimization. This work highlights the potential of microwave&#8208;assisted sintering as a cost&#8208;effective and scalable approach for advancing high&#8208;performance SOC technologies.

         <title>Engineering CRISPR System&#8208;Based Bacterial Outer Membrane Vesicle Potentiates T Cell Immunity for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a multifunctional CRISPR&#8208;dCas9&#8208;based OMV platform termed OMV&#8208;C9I12, which facilitates the coexpression of CXCL9 and IL&#8208;12 within tumor cells. This platform enhances T cell recruitment and activation, synergizes with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 immunotherapy, and amplifies antitumor T cell immunity. This demonstrates significant therapeutic efficacy in a broad range of tumors and offers a promising strategy to overcome immunotherapy resistance.








Abstract
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has revolutionized cancer treatment but only benefits a subset of patients because of insufficient infiltration and inactivation of effector T cells. Bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) can activate immunity and deliver therapeutic agents for immunotherapy. However, efficiently targeting and packaging therapeutic molecules into OMVs remains challenging. Here, the engineered E. coli BL21&#8208;derived OMVs enable the packaging of multiple genes, resulting in a 7&#8208;fold increase in DNA enrichment efficiency and gene silencing in vitro. Moreover, the engineered OMVs carrying genes encoding CXCL9 and IL12 (OMV&#8208;C9I12) reprogram tumor cells to secrete these factors, significantly enhancing T&#8208;cell chemotaxis and activation. More importantly, this system markedly inhibits tumors, extends survival, and synergizes with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 therapy in murine MB49 and B16F10 tumor models. Single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing (scRNA&#8208;seq) further reveals significant upregulation of T&#8208;cell chemotaxis and activation&#8208;related pathways following OMV&#8208;C9I12 treatment. Finally, OMV&#8208;C9I12 potentiates T cell&#8208;mediated immunotherapy and suppresses the growth of bladder and breast cancer tumors in humanized mouse models. These findings highlight the potential of this engineered OMV platform for cancer gene therapy and provide novel strategies to overcome resistance to immunotherapy.

         <title>de novo Fabrication of Dense Collagen Matrices with Patterned Hierarchical Structures for Corneal Stromal Tissue Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, it is reported that top&#8208;down inputs can be coupled with contextual cues control to guide the bottom&#8208;up assembly of collagen to form dense matrices with spatially&#8208;defined mesoscale structures: i) mild electrical inputs electro&#8208;assemble collagen molecules into a dense metastable state composed of partially assembled molten fibrils; ii) permissive contextual cues (especially controlled humidity) enable these molten fibrils to undergo further hierarchical assembly, to form a stable thickened fibril state; and iii) spatially&#8208;controlled optical inputs can induce riboflavin&#8208;based photocrosslinking to locally trap the structure of metastable molten fibril state and yield a stable state with thin fibrils. This approach can de novo fabricate biomimetic patterned collagens (e.g., cornea&#8208;sclera structure). It is envisioned that this work provides a generic approach for controlling collagen's multiscale assembly for a broad range of biomedical applications.








Abstract
Collagen is a versatile biological building block that is guided by extracellular cues to self&#8208;assemble into diverse hierarchical structures that perform various tissue functions. Here, the use of top&#8208;down inputs and controlled contextual cues is reported for the de novo fabrication of patterned dense collagen matrices with spatially varying tailored mesoscale structures. Initially, imposed electrical inputs are used to guide collagen triple helix molecules to partially assemble into a dense metastable molten fibril state that can be induced by permissive contextual cues (especially humidity) to undergo further assembly. Spatially&#8208;controlled optical inputs that induce riboflavin&#8208;based photo&#8208;crosslinking can locally&#8208;trap partially assembled states (e.g., molten fibrils). To illustrate the potential of collagen patterning, a functional corneal stromal substitute is specifically fabricated that mimics the microstructures of collagen in cornea&#8208;sclera and demonstrates that it can restore histological structure and function in a corneal defect rabbit model. This generic approach for the de novo fabrication of mesoscale&#8208;structured collagen is envisioned to have broad applications in regenerative medicine.

         <title>Light&#8208;Fueled In&#8208;Operando Shape Reconfiguration, Fixation, and Recovery of Magnetically Actuated Microtextured Covalent Adaptable Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalent adaptable network with dynamic disulfide bonds (DS&#8208;CAN) can rearrange its molecular topology through heating or UV irradiation. When combined with ferromagnetic particles, its photoresponsiveness at room temperature enables contactless, spatiotemporal regulation of dynamic bond exchanges during magnetomechanical actuation. This approach enables 3D microfabrication with selective, chemical&#8208;free, reversible shape reconfiguration and fixation in dry conditions without physical contact.








Abstract
Covalent adaptable networks (CANs) enable reprocessability via dynamic bond exchange above their topology freezing transition temperature (Tv) despite chemical crosslinks. However, conventional CANs often exhibit insufficient viscosity reduction upon heating, necessitating extensive application of&#160;heat and pressure through direct contact for processing. In this study, a disulfide&#8208;bonded CAN is introduced to facilitate UV&#8208;assisted processing at room temperature, in addition to conventional thermal processing above Tv. At room temperature, UV irradiation accelerates stress relaxation, mirroring the effect of high&#8208;temperature activation (&gt; Tv = 86&#160;&#176;C) without UV. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation also reveals the underlying mechanism of UV&#8208; and heat&#8208;induced dynamic bond exchange. By incorporating magnetic NdFeB particles, magnetomechanical actuation of CAN/NdFeB microarrays is achieved. Unlike conventional approaches which rely on binders to maintain actuated shapes after removal of magnetic field, this system enables in&#8208;operando UV&#8208;fueled shape reconfiguration and fixation through dynamic bond exchange at room temperature, with reversible recovery of the original architectures on&#8208;demand. Furthermore, photoresponsivity allows for contactless spatiotemporal control over dynamic bond exchanges and resultant microarchitectures via a masking technique. This strategy offers facile, patternable 3D microfabrication and binder&#8208;free homologous shape&#8208;fixation in dry conditions without external pressure.

&lt;p&gt;Covalent adaptable networks (CANs) enable reprocessability via dynamic bond exchange above their topology freezing transition temperature (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) despite chemical crosslinks. However, conventional CANs often exhibit insufficient viscosity reduction upon heating, necessitating extensive application of&#160;heat and pressure through direct contact for processing. In this study, a disulfide-bonded CAN is introduced to facilitate UV-assisted processing at room temperature, in addition to conventional thermal processing above &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;. At room temperature, UV irradiation accelerates stress relaxation, mirroring the effect of high-temperature activation (&amp;gt; &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; = 86&#160;&#176;C) without UV. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation also reveals the underlying mechanism of UV- and heat-induced dynamic bond exchange. By incorporating magnetic NdFeB particles, magnetomechanical actuation of CAN/NdFeB microarrays is achieved. Unlike conventional approaches which rely on binders to maintain actuated shapes after removal of magnetic field, this system enables in-operando UV-fueled shape reconfiguration and fixation through dynamic bond exchange at room temperature, with reversible recovery of the original architectures on-demand. Furthermore, photoresponsivity allows for contactless spatiotemporal control over dynamic bond exchanges and resultant microarchitectures via a masking technique. This strategy offers facile, patternable 3D microfabrication and binder-free homologous shape-fixation in dry conditions without external pressure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Active Center Exploration in Atomically Thin MoSxTe2&#8208;x Electrocatalysts for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides an unsupervised machine learning (ML) framework based on Zernike features and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP)&#8208;assisted clustering in a closed&#8208;loop experiment procedure for automatically identifying active electrocatalytic centers from atomic&#8208;resolution micrographs, displaying how artificial intelligence and human experts seamlessly cooperate to rapidly establish structure&#8208;property&#8208;performance relationships for high&#8208;performance catalyst design.








Abstract
Modulating the local configurations is widely considered an efficient strategy to promote the catalytic performance of 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Although transmission electron microscopy prevails as a central tool to visualize catalysts at atomic resolution, there still lacks a rapid and accurate approach to finding the active centers in the micrographs containing abundant structural information. Herein, a defective MoSxTe2&#8208;x alloy catalyst is created through low&#8208;temperature sulfurization of 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoTe2 (S&#8208;MoTe2), whose atomic structure is automatically explored using an unsupervised machine learning (ML) framework based on the Zernike feature and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP)&#8208;assisted clustering, enabling the discovery of a novel defect configuration referred antisite Te adatom (Teads&#8208;Mo). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a synergistic enhancement in both the hydrogen adsorption capability and electronic conductivity of these antisite defects, which is experimentally verified by the half&#8208;reduced overpotential and Tafel slope of S&#8208;MoTe2 alloy compared to its counterparts without Teads&#8208;Mo. This work provides an intelligent approach to facilitate active center exploration in micrographs and achieves a closed&#8208;loop verification for the ML&#8208;assisted defect discovery via theoretical calculations and electrochemical experiments, displaying how ML and researchers seamlessly cooperate in a scientific workflow for advanced catalyst development.

         <title>Sonodynamic and Bioorthogonal Sonocatalytic Thrombotic Therapy Based on AIE Cationic Tetranuclear Ir(III) Complex Nanoplatform Guided by NIR&#8208;Chemiluminescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>

AIE&#8208;active tetranuclear Ir(III) complex Ir&#8208;4 as a sonosensitizer/sonocatalyst is formulated into a nanoplatform with an H2S donor. Ir&#8208;4@S&#8208;R NPs achieves combined endogenous NIR chemiluminescence imaging, sonodynamic therapy and release of H2S in situ by a bioorthogonal sonocatalytic reaction in vivo, achieving safe thrombolysis and anti&#8208;inflammatory therapy.








Abstract
Non&#8208;invasive thrombolytic strategies include photothermal therapy (PTT), photodynamic therapy (PDT) and sonodynamic therapy (SDT). The development of PTT and PDT is impeded by the limited tissue penetration depth of the light source. SDT is a promising method due to the deeper tissue penetration and site&#8208;specific features of ultrasound; however, the scarcity of efficient sonosensitizers has constrained its clinical use. Herein, ultrasound&#8208;triggered nanoparticles (NPs), named Ir&#8208;4@S&#8208;R NPs, achieve a sonodynamic thrombolytic, bioorthogonal sonocatalytic reaction, with chemiluminescence (CL) imaging in the thrombus. An Ir(III) complex, named Ir&#8208;4, which has aggregation induced emission (AIE), combined with a hydrogen sulfide donor, named H2S&#8208;N3, provide the nanoplatform which is modified with the peptide c(RGDfC) to target the thrombus. This supramolecular assembly successfully integrates: i) thrombosis detection based on near&#8208;infrared (NIR) chemiluminescence imaging, ii) sonodynamic thrombus therapy and iii) release of hydrogen sulfide for anti&#8208;inflammatory action. Ir&#8208;4@S&#8208;R NPs emit long&#8208;lasting NIR CL triggered by endogenous ONOO&#8722; and achieve 12&#160;mm deep tissue penetration. Blood clots are effectively removed and blood flow is almost fully restored in mouse carotid thrombus and rat femoral vein models. The work demonstrates a new integrated strategy for diagnosing and treating life&#8208;threatening diseases caused by thrombusotic disorders.

         <title>Granular Hydrogels as Brittle Yield Stress Fluids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the Kamani&#8208;Donley&#8208;Rogers yield stress fluid model can describe granular hydrogel deformation. The model robustly captures transient rheology and self&#8208;healing behavior for granular gels of varying composition using only six parameters. This framework provides new insight regarding the effect of material parameters on granular yielding and informs advanced applications such as extrusion&#8208;based granular (hydrogel) printing and material ageing/remodeling.








Abstract
While granular hydrogels are increasingly used in biomedical applications, methods to capture their rheological behavior generally consider shear&#8208;thinning and self&#8208;healing properties or produce ensemble metrics (e.g., dynamic moduli) while neglecting transient yielding and unyielding processes. Combining oscillatory shear testing with Brittility (Bt) via the Kamani&#8208;Donley&#8208;Rogers (KDR) model, this work shows that granular hydrogels behave as brittle yield stress fluids. This work quantifies steady and transient rheology as a function of microgel properties and granular composition for polyethylene glycol and gelatin microgels. The KDR model with Bt captures granular hydrogel behavior for a wide range of design parameters, reducing the complex rheology to a determination of model parameters. In granular mixtures, this work observes monotonic dependencies of the elastic modulus, structural viscosity, and brittility upon granular composition, while the yield stress is lower for mixtures. Microgel size distribution and polymer fraction are the most influential parameters in monolithic granular hydrogels, while microgel size and packing density are less impactful. The model robustly captures self&#8208;healing behavior and reveals that granular hydrogel relaxation accelerates with an increased small&#8208;amplitude strain rate. This quantitative framework is an important step toward rational design of granular hydrogels for applications ranging from injection and in situ stabilization to 3D bioprinting.

         <title>Activatable Enzymatic Nanoplatform Incorporated into Microneedle Patch for Relieving Tumor Hypoxia Augmented Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>

Activatable enzymatic nanoplatform incorporated into microneedle patch is developed for relieving tumor hypoxia augmented photodynamic therapy.








Abstract
The clinical advancement of photodynamic therapy (PDT) faces entrenched impediments, particularly the suboptimal solubility of hydrophobic photosensitizers (PSs) and tumor&#8208;associated hypoxia. Herein, a universally applicable, carrier&#8208;free nanotherapeutic platform is devised in which catalase (CAT) functions dually as a biocatalytic oxygenator and a biocompatible scaffold for PSs encapsulation. Through self&#8208;assembly with diverse hydrophobic PSs&#8212;including 2&#8208;(1&#8208;hexyloxyethyl)&#8208;2&#8208;divinyl&#8208;pyropheophorbide&#8208;a (HPPH), chlorin e6 (Ce6), and zinc (II)&#8208;phthalocyanine (ZnPc)&#8212;CAT forms uniform and stable PS@CAT nanoparticles (NPs), obviating the necessity for supplementary nanocarriers. These nanostructures are embedded within microneedle (MN) patches, facilitating minimally invasive, spatially targeted transdermal administration. The PSs bind to the hydrophobic pocket of CAT within NPs, temporarily suppressing its bioactivity, which is restored upon NPs disassembly in the acidic tumor microenvironment (TME). This pH&#8208;responsive &#8220;OFF&#8208;to&#8208;ON&#8221; mechanism orchestrates the synchronized release of PSs and reactivation of CAT, which catalyzes endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H&#8322;O&#8322;) to generate oxygen (O2), alleviating hypoxia and augmenting O2 availability for PDT. In vivo validation in a 4T1 murine mammary carcinoma model corroborated this approach's therapeutic superiority and biocompatibility. Collectively, the findings delineate a minimalist, multifunctional strategy to simultaneously enhance the bioavailability of PSs and overcome hypoxia in PDT for more efficacious oncologic therapy.

         <title>A Dendritic Cell&#8208;Nanogel Conjugate for Tumor&#8208;Draining Lymph Node&#8208;Specific PD&#8208;L1 Blockade</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a dendritic cell (DC)&#8208;based strategy for the targeted delivery of ICB antibodies to tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLNs). The platform is fabricated by conjugating anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody nanogels with tumor antigen&#8208;pulsed DCs. Subcutaneous administration of the platform enables TDLN&#8208;tropic migration and antibody release under reductive conditions. The platform mobilizes T cell immunity while blocking PD&#8208;L1 on DCs and myeloid cells within TDLNs, augmenting systemic antitumor immunity to suppress tumor growth. This study presents a novel strategy for TDLN&#8208;targeted PD&#8208;L1 blockade, unveiling new translational opportunities of combining DC&#8208;based vaccination with ICB therapy.








Abstract
Targeted blockade of immune checkpoints within tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) represents a promising strategy to potentiate immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. However, the limited delivery of checkpoint inhibitors to TDLNs and inadequate T cell priming persist as major challenges. In this study, an innovative dendritic cell (DC)&#8208;based strategy is developed for the targeted delivery of ICB antibodies to TDLNs. The platform is fabricated by conjugating anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody nanogels with DCs, which are further enhanced by pre&#8208;treating DCs with tumor antigens. Subcutaneous administration enabled DCs to execute their intrinsic TDLN&#8208;tropic migration, thus facilitating antibody delivery and release under reductive conditions. The antigen&#8208;loaded DCs mobilized T cell immunity, while the anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibodies block PD&#8208;L1 on dendritic cells and myeloid cells within TDLNs, thereby augmenting systemic antitumor immunity. This approach significantly suppresses breast cancer growth, leading to 83.3% of treated mice being tumor&#8208;free. This study presents a novel strategy for TDLN&#8208;targeted PD&#8208;L1 blockade by harnessing the intrinsic TDLN tropism of DCs, unveiling new translational opportunities of combining DC&#8208;based vaccination with ICB therapy.

         <title>Dynamic Size&#8208;Change Nanovaccine for Enhancing Lymph Node Deep Penetration and Eliciting Robust Antitumor Immune Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic size&#8208;change nanovaccines (DashVax) overcome the lymphatic delivery paradox through programmed size transition. Constructed from dynamic covalent bonds, these 102 nm assemblies time&#8208;dependently disassemble into 5 nm subunits within LNs, leveraging large&#8208;particle drainage efficiency while enabling small&#8208;particle penetration through anatomical barriers. This dynamic size&#8208;change strategy achieves 7.3&#215; enhanced paracortical delivery, potentiating cytotoxic T cell responses and suppressing tumor growth in B16&#8208;OVA and MC38 tumor models.








Abstract
Breakthrough advances in nanotechnology have substantially enhanced lymph node (LN) targeting efficiency and immune cell uptake of nanovaccines, establishing novel avenues for tumor immunotherapy. Nevertheless, current nanovaccines predominantly accumulate in subcapsular sinuses (SCS) or superficial cortical regions post&#8208;lymphatic transport, failing to traverse anatomical barriers to reach the T cell&#8208;enriched paracortex&#8212;a critical delivery bottleneck that severely limits full activation of cellular immunity. Furthermore, the absence of tumor&#8208;specific endogenous stimuli in LN microenvironments invalidates conventional environment&#8208;responsive delivery strategies. Herein, &#8220;dynamically size&#8208;change nanovaccine&#8221; (DashVax), a time&#8208;controlled self&#8208;disassembling nanovaccine is presented that achieves dynamic size transition from 102 to 5 nm via physiologically regulated imine bond hydrolysis. This design capitalizes on the lymphatic drainage superiority of large particles and tissue&#8208;penetrating capacity of small units, achieving a breakthrough 7.3&#8208;fold enhancement in paracortical antigen delivery compared to non&#8208;size&#8208;change nanovaccines (NoncVax). DashVax demonstrates&#160;robust antigen&#8208;specific immune responses and tumor growth suppression in both B16&#8208;OVA and MC38 tumor models. This exogenous stimulus&#8208;free temporal delivery strategy not only redefines nanovaccine design principles but also elucidates fundamental correlations between intranodal delivery kinetics and immune activation efficacy.

         <title>A Tri&#8208;Mode Photothermal, Phase&#8208;Change, and Radiative&#8208;Cooling Film for All&#8208;Day Thermoelectric Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microencapsulated phase change materials (MPCMs) with Ti2O3/TiO2 composite shells are designed for LSPR modulation. MPCMs have full&#8208;spectrum absorption, high photothermal conversion efficiency, and thermal storage capacity. Based on MPCMs, a multifunctional tri&#8208;mode photothermal, phase&#8208;change, and radiative&#8208;cooling film is developed for efficient solar&#8208;thermal&#8208;electric (STE) energy conversion. The MPCMs and composite films provide a promising strategy for solar energy utilization and advanced STE conversion applications.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;thermal&#8208;electric conversion shows great promise, especially in off&#8208;grid aerospace and navigation. However, low output density and intermittency of solar energy limit its application. Herein, a microencapsulated phase change material (MPCMs) is designed with a n&#8208;Tetracosane core and TiO2/Ti2O3 composite shell to address the above issue. The MPCM exhibits a latent heat of 144.5 J&#160;g&#8722;1, a photothermal conversion efficiency of 93.7% and 100% energy storage capacity. The thermoelectric system resulting from coupling the multifunctional film composed of polydimethylsiloxane and MPCMs with the thermoelectric module is capable of successfully achieving adaptive 24&#160;h uninterrupted power generation on account of its functions of photothermal conversion, energy storage, and radiative cooling. The output power density of the TES ranged from 6.1 to 21.1&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2 at light intensities of 1000&#8211;5000&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2. The material design innovatively endows a single material with the functions of photothermal conversion, phase change energy storage, and radiative cooling, making it can adaptively harvest energy from both the sun and cold space. This multifunctional material offers new insights into the repeatable storage and high&#8208;quality utilization of solar energy, holding significant scientific implications for the development of all&#8208;day solar&#8208;thermal&#8208;electric power generation technology.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescent Elastomer with High Luminescent and Mechanical Performances Enabled by Multiple Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent elastomer is prepared by incorporating ureide phosphorescent chromophore into hard segments of polyurethane. Due to the multiple hydrogen bonding and microphase separation, the elastomer exhibits robust luminescent and mechanical properties. It is expected to find applications in flexible electronics and information storage.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent elastomer is promising for flexible electronics. However, preparation of such elastomer with high luminescent and mechanical performances remains a challenge. In this study, a room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) elastomer is prepared by incorporating ureides as luminophores into hard segments of polyurethane forming multiple hydrogen bonds. Upon ultraviolet activation, the RTP elastomer shows a recorded absolute quantum yield of 72.1% and a phosphorescence lifetime of 1079&#160;ms. It also has high mechanical properties with reprocessability. Its tensile strength and elongation at break as high as 58.3&#160;MPa and 1160%, respectively, and its toughness reaches 299.9&#160;MJ m&#8722;3. Particularly, it withstands extreme strain of 1100% or 100 cycles of elongation recovery without any change in luminescent properties. The microphase separation structure with multiple hydrogen bonded hard segment phase is thought to be responsible for its high performances. Given its robust phosphorescence efficiency alongside exceptional toughness, this RTP elastomer holds promise for innovative applications in flexible electronics, information encryption, and data storage.

         <title>A Gas Nanobomb to Promote Drug Penetration and Amplify TACE Therapy for Orthotopic Liver Tumor</title>

Multifunctional embolic agent is successfully synthesized with the introduction of magnesium hydride (MgH2) nanoparticles into lipiodol (Lip) &amp;tirapazamine (TPZ) dispersion for efficient supply H2, OH&#8722;, and Mg2+. The L&#8208;MgH2&amp;TPZ suspension demonstrates effective elimination of primary tumors, and inhibition of tumor metastasis and recurrence when combined with the immune checkpoint inhibitors. Transarterial embolization by L&#8208;MgH2&amp;TPZ suspension completely eradicates orthotopic rat liver tumors.








Abstract
The worsening hypoxia, acidity, immunosuppression, and low drug penetration created by arterial embolization significantly limit the therapeutic efficiency of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) therapy. To overcome these problems, nanoscale magnesium hydride (MgH2) gas bombs are synthesized and then are co&#8208;dispersed with tirapazamine (TPZ) into lipiodol (Lip) to obtain an L&#8208;MgH2&amp;TPZ suspension, in which the MgH2 nanobombs efficiently modulate the worsened tumor microenvironment (TME), reversed immunosuppression, promoted drug penetration, and amplified TACE therapy. After being injected into mouse tumors, MgH2 nanobombs react with water to effectively generate OH&#8722; to neutralize the acidic TME and reverse immunosuppression; hydrogen (H2) gas bubbles enhance TPZ penetration and achieve hydrogen&#8208;based chemotherapy; and Mg2+ synergistically regulates T&#8208;cell function, resulting in significant inhibition for tumor growth. Moreover, the immunological effects of H2 and Mg2+&#8208;induced antitumor immune responses further inhibit tumor growth and metastasis after combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. As demonstrated in the orthotopic rat liver cancer model, transarterial embolization of the L&#8208;MgH2&amp;TPZ suspension offers greatly enhanced therapeutic outcomes, and all of tumors are eradicated after 3 weeks of treatment, further confirming that the introduction of the MgH2 nanobombs significantly modulates the acidic/immunosuppressive TME and promotes the penetration of TPZ to improve the efficacy of TACE therapy.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Recycling Ruthenium Incorporated CuFe2O4 Electrocatalyst for Efficient Neutral Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ electrogenerated adsorbed Fe2+ (Fe2+ad) species effectively capture OH&#8722; ions, creating a localized alkaline microenvironment at the RuSA&#8208;CuFe2O4 surface. This promotes a self&#8208;sustaining cycle between Fe2+ad release and &#945;&#8208;FeOOH reconstruction, endowing the electrocatalyst with both high NH3 selectivity and long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
The high performance of Fe&#8208;based electrocatalyst for electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction to ammonia (eNO3&#8722;RR&#8208;to&#8208;NH3) is currently constrained by low NH3 selectivity and insufficient stability under high current density. Hence, the incorporation of ruthenium single&#8208;atom into the CuFe2O4 (RuSA&#8208;CuFe2O4) with self&#8208;recycling property is developed. The Cu and Ru sites synergistically promote the water dissociation and facilitate the redeposition of in situ adsorbed Fe2+ (Fe2+ad) as &#945;&#8208;FeOOH by self&#8208;reinforcing local alkalinity at the RuSA&#8208;CuFe2O4 surface, thereby achieving high activity and robust stability for eNO3&#8722;RR&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 process. The optimized RuSA&#8208;CuFe2O4 delivers excellent performance with a 97.9% NH3 Faradaic efficiency and 99.8% NH3 selectivity at &#8722;0.59&#160;V versus RHE in neutral electrolyte. Remarkably, in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) system, it achieves a large current density of 1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 2.5&#160;V with robust stability, accompanied by &gt;95% NH3 selectivity, a nitrate removal rate of 4.17&#160;mmol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2, and an NH3 production rate of 3.97&#160;mmol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2. Theoretical calculations have demonstrated that Ru site in the RuSA&#8208;CuFe2O4 significantly enhances NO3&#8722; adsorption and lowers the energy barrier for the potential determining step (*HNO2 &#8594; *NO). This work offers valuable insights into designing autonomous local alkalinity microenvironments with self&#8208;recycling properties on cost&#8208;effective Cu/Fe oxides.

         <title>Resonator&#8208;Free Metamaterials Based on Ferromagnetic Dielectrics for Mandatory Microwave Loss and Compact Stealth Cloaks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferromagnetic dielectric metamaterials are constructed by arranging ferromagnetic dielectric units composed of CIPs and PU. The incident wave is transformed into a surface wave crawling along the metamaterial by adjusting the phase gradient and unit size. In addition, due to the microwave attenuation effect of the ferromagnetic dielectric, the surface wave is lost secondarily.








Abstract
The utilization of resonant&#8208;unit&#8208;based metamaterials in beam control and compact stealth applications is inherently limited by the strong correlation between unit in&#8208;plane dimensions and reflection characteristics. Therefore, this study proposes a resonator&#8208;free metamaterial based on ferromagnetic dielectric that decouples the amplitude and phase by regulating interface interference, thereby achieving phase modulation independent of the in&#8208;plane dimensions of the FD units. With the introduction of a constant phase gradient and tuning of unit dimensions, reflected waves can be deflected or even converted into surface waves that propagate along the metamaterial interface. This enables a novel electromagnetic loss mechanism wherein the reflected energy undergoes mandatory attenuation by horizontally propagating within the lossy ferromagnetic dielectric. Simulations and experiments are conducted to prove this phenomenon, yielding an improvement of 36.64% in the average power loss density, a minimum reflection loss of &#8722;52&#160;dB. Further, the efficacy of ferromagnetic dielectric units is validated for compact stealth cloaks, and a conformal curved stealth strategy that requires only unit dimension tuning to achieve scattering&#8208;field camouflage for arbitrarily shaped targets is proposed. Given its resonator&#8208;independent operation, the proposed metamaterial exhibits miniaturization advantages of cross&#8208;scale downsizing (in&#8208;plane dimension &lt; &#955;/12)&#8212;a critical advancement for compact electromagnetic defense systems.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Chelating and ROS&#8208;Scavenging Polymers with Thioketal and Thioether Bonds Delivering Ferroptosis Inhibitor Lip&#8208;1 Provide a Triple Therapeutic Strategy for Retina Ganglion Cells in Acute Glaucoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study employs polymer P1 and polymer P2 as drug carriers to encapsulate Lip&#8208;1 into NPsLip&#8208;1. This system provides triple protection: (1) ROS scavenging via thioether/thioketal bond cleavage, (2) iron ion chelation through exposed NOTA groups, and (3) GPX4 activity restoration by Lip&#8208;1. This synergistic strategy rescues RGCs, restores visual function in vivo, and demonstrates excellent ocular safety.








Abstract
Glaucoma is an irreversible blinding eye disease characterized by retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death with emerging evidence highlighting ferroptosis as a crucial mechanism. Herein, two iron&#8208;chelating and reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;scavenging polymers with thioketal and thioester bonds delivering Lip&#8208;1 are designed and self&#8208;assembled into NPsLip&#8208;1, which pose a triple threat to RGC of Acute Glaucoma via ROS scavenging, iron ion chelation, and potent ferroptosis inhibition. Upon immediate cellular uptake of NPsLip1 by RGCs, the elevated intracellular ROS triggers the cleavage of thioether bonds and the oxidation of thioester bonds, resulting in ROS consumption and simultaneous release of Lip&#8208;1 and exposure of polymer chains with pendant 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;triacetic acid (NOTA) groups. On the one hand, the NOTA groups can chelate with iron ions, thereby inhibiting ferroptosis in RGCs. On the other hand, the released Lip&#8208;1 can inhibit ferroptosis by upregulating glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). Together, NPsLip&#8208;1 with a triple threat markedly reduced ferroptosis and oxidative stress, significantly enhancing the survival of R28 cells. Further, NPsLip&#8208;1 effectively inhibits the RGC ferroptosis and preserves the visual function. Overall, the findings indicated NPsLip&#8208;1 provides substantial protection for RGCs via suppressing oxidative stress and ferroptosis, representing a promising therapeutic avenue for glaucoma.

&lt;p&gt;This study employs polymer P1 and polymer P2 as drug carriers to encapsulate Lip-1 into NPs&lt;sup&gt;Lip-1&lt;/sup&gt;. This system provides triple protection: (1) ROS scavenging via thioether/thioketal bond cleavage, (2) iron ion chelation through exposed NOTA groups, and (3) GPX4 activity restoration by Lip-1. This synergistic strategy rescues RGCs, restores visual function in vivo, and demonstrates excellent ocular safety.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glaucoma is an irreversible blinding eye disease characterized by retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death with emerging evidence highlighting ferroptosis as a crucial mechanism. Herein, two iron-chelating and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging polymers with thioketal and thioester bonds delivering Lip-1 are designed and self-assembled into NPs&lt;sup&gt;Lip-1&lt;/sup&gt;, which pose a triple threat to RGC of Acute Glaucoma via ROS scavenging, iron ion chelation, and potent ferroptosis inhibition. Upon immediate cellular uptake of NPs&lt;sup&gt;Lip1&lt;/sup&gt; by RGCs, the elevated intracellular ROS triggers the cleavage of thioether bonds and the oxidation of thioester bonds, resulting in ROS consumption and simultaneous release of Lip-1 and exposure of polymer chains with pendant 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (NOTA) groups. On the one hand, the NOTA groups can chelate with iron ions, thereby inhibiting ferroptosis in RGCs. On the other hand, the released Lip-1 can inhibit ferroptosis by upregulating glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). Together, NPs&lt;sup&gt;Lip-1&lt;/sup&gt; with a triple threat markedly reduced ferroptosis and oxidative stress, significantly enhancing the survival of R28 cells. Further, NPs&lt;sup&gt;Lip-1&lt;/sup&gt; effectively inhibits the RGC ferroptosis and preserves the visual function. Overall, the findings indicated NPs&lt;sup&gt;Lip-1&lt;/sup&gt; provides substantial protection for RGCs via suppressing oxidative stress and ferroptosis, representing a promising therapeutic avenue for glaucoma.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A GaN Schottky Barrier Diode&#8208;Based Terahertz Metasurface for High&#8208;Precision Phase Control and High&#8208;Speed Beam Scanning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmable terahertz metasurface based on gallium nitride Schottky barrier diodes is demonstrated. By tuning antenna resonance via junction capacitance, the metasurface achieves high&#8208;efficiency, high&#8208;precision, and fast&#8208;response continuous phase modulation over a wide range. Dual&#8208;mode (analog/digital) operation enables &#177;45&#176; beam scanning with flat gain, providing a scalable platform for next&#8208;generation THz communication and sensing.








Abstract
Effective wavefront control in the terahertz (THz) regime is essential for achieving high&#8208;directionality beamforming, spatial multiplexing, and real&#8208;time wireless communication. However, low&#8208;loss, precise, and rapid THz phase modulation remains fundamentally constrained by material limitations and inherent device&#8208;level trade&#8208;offs. A programmable THz metasurface (GaNMS) is presented, employing a gallium nitride Schottky barrier diode with a high&#8208;mobility 2D electron gas, specifically designed to overcome these limitations by leveraging its low insertion loss, fast response, and continuously tunable junction capacitance. A 32 &#215; 25&#8208;element array is designed and fabricated. Each unit cell functions as a direct THz phase shifter, dynamically tuning the junction capacitance to enable continuous phase modulation from 0&#176; to 210&#176; at 0.32 THz, with a 1.8&#176; average phase error, modulation speed exceeding 200&#160;MHz, and &#8776;5&#160;dB average insertion loss. To mitigate array&#8208;level nonuniformities, a differential evolution&#8208;based optimization algorithm is introduced, enabling robust &#177;45&#176; beam scanning in both analog and digital modes, with main lobe gains of 18.5 and 16 dBi, respectively. An integrated GaNMS&#8208;based sensing and communication system is also demonstrated, validating its potential in next&#8208;generation THz applications. The proposed GaNMS bridges device&#8208;level phase tunability and system&#8208;level functionality, enabling practical THz technologies.

         <title>Scalable Production of 24&#8208;Hour&#8208;Long Afterglow Plastics Through Molecular Doping Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
24&#8208;H&#8208;long afterglow (HLA) plastics are fabricated at a large scale through a molecular doping strategy compatible with industrial engineering processes. The resulting doped plastics demonstrated green afterglow persisting for 24 h under ambient conditions, setting a new benchmark for polymeric materials. Remarkably, these materials can be activated by natural sunlight, highlighting their practical utility for engineering applications.








Abstract
The development of polymeric afterglow materials has garnered significant interest due to their promising applications in sensing technologies, smart devices, and optoelectronic systems. However, conventional engineering plastics typically exhibit limited afterglow properties owing to rapid nonradiative decay processes under ambient conditions. This study presents a breakthrough in the fabrication of plastics with 24&#8208;h&#8208;long afterglow (HLA) properties through a molecular doping strategy compatible with industrial engineering processes. By utilizing aromatic plastics as electron acceptor and the matrix, spirofluorene derivatives are incorporated as electron donors and chromophore dopants via a melt blending technique, a widely established method in polymer manufacturing. The resulting doped plastics demonstrated green afterglow persisting for 24 h under ambient conditions. At 4&#160;&#176;C, the HLA lasted for up to 100 h after ceasing photoexcitation, setting a new benchmark for polymeric materials. Remarkably, these materials could be activated by natural sunlight and maintain a visible green afterglow for 5 h in ambient air. Mechanism studies revealed that the HLA phenomenon is associated with the formation of donor/acceptor exciplexes upon photoexcitation. Additionally, the HLA plastics exhibited exceptional mechanical flexibility and optical transparency, making them highly suitable for advanced applications in flexible displays and next&#8208;generation wearable technologies.

         <title>Spin&#8208;polarized Acidic Water Electrolysis with Antenna&#8208;Reactor Plasmonic Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral plasmonic antenna&#8211;reactor electrocatalyst, integrating Au nanoflowers as the antenna and iridium single atoms as the reactor, achieves spin&#8208;polarized and light&#8208;driven water electrolysis in acidic media. The catalyst exhibits high activity and durability, enabled by hot&#8208;carrier transfer and the CISS effect, as supported by operando spectroscopy and DFT simulations.









Abstract

Water electrolysis, driven by renewable electricity, offers a sustainable path for hydrogen production. However, efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts are needed to overcome the high overpotentials of both the oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction. To address this, a novel catalyst system is developed integrating plasmonic nanoreactors with chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity. In this system, chiral Au nanoparticles act as antennae, while single&#8208;atom iridium serves as the catalytic reactor, achieving a 3.5 fold increase in reaction kinetics (at 1.57&#160;V vs RHE) compared to commercial IrO2 catalysts and enhancing durability by over 4.8 times relative to conventional Pt/C || IrO2 systems. Density functional theory and operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveal that plasmon&#8208;driven spin alignment polarizes the Ir atom, significantly enhancing stability (&gt;480 h at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) under acidic conditions. This work represents a major advance in spin polarization for plasmonic electrocatalysis, offering a new route to sustainable energy solutions.

         <title>Highly Responsive Self&#8208;Healing and Degradable Piezoelectric Soft Machines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a self&#8208;healing and stretchable material is used to develop a damage resistant energy harvester capable of powering electric bulbs, and a sensing system to intelligently classify biomechanical activities is represented.








Abstract
Piezoelectric materials that are simultaneously healable, stretchable, and degradable have remained an unmet challenge, limiting advancements in wearable and implantable electronics, where devices face multidimensional mechanical deformation, causing a risk of damage. To address this critical gap, a biocompatible piezoelectric material is developed for ultrahigh piezoelectric effects with DL&#8208;alanine amino acid crystals, which is stretchable, healable, and degradable. The in situ grown DL&#8208;alanine piezoelectric crystals within an ionically cross&#8208;linked gelatin hydrogel matrix strengthen the piezoelectric properties with an ultrahigh voltage coefficient of 1.6 Vm&#160;N&#8722;1. The combination of the piezo&#8208;ionic property and crystal alignment results in a record&#8208;breaking energy harvesting figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit value at 57.6 pm2&#160;N&#8722;1 to deliver outstanding mili&#8208;watt level power outputs in proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept devices which can power up even several electric light bulbs. An elastically stretchable, damage resistant strain sensor is further optimized for real&#8208;time healthcare monitoring and biomechanical motion tracking. By integrating machine learning algorithms, the sensing system intelligently classifies biomechanical activities with high accuracy, enabling advanced applications in healthcare, rehabilitation, and sports monitoring.

         <title>Immobilizing Lead and Healing Surface Defects via Perfluorinated Tertiary Amine Molecules Enables High&#8208;Performance Sustainable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perfluorination strategy using perfluorotriethylamine (PFTEA) enables simultaneous surface defect passivation and lead immobilization in inverted perovskite solar cells. This approach yields a certified efficiency of 26.65% and excellent long&#8208;term operational stability, offering a promising route toward high&#8208;performance and environmentally sustainable perovskite photovoltaics.








Abstract
The intrinsic instability and nonradiative recombination induced by surface defects hinder the further development of p&#8208;i&#8208;n inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Simultaneously, the commercial application of inverted PSCs is limited by environmental unfriendliness resulting from lead leakage. Herein, a universal perfluorination strategy is reported to immobilize lead and passivate surface defects of perovskite films in inverted PSCs. It is demonstrated that perfluorinated perfluorotriethylamine (PFTEA) can form PFTEA&#183;PbI2 complex with PbI2 via a strong coordination bond, which is favorable for suppressing lead leakage and promoting defect passivation. Due to much reduced surface nonradiative recombination, the PFTEA&#8208;modulated inverted PSCs deliver a fascinating certified stabilized power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.65%, a record efficiency value reported for PSCs using the vacuum flash evaporation technique. Moreover, the PFTEA&#8208;modulated devices maintain 92% of their initial PCE after 1000&#160;h of continuous maximum power point tracking. This work provides a simple and effective avenue to advance the sustainable development of inverted photovoltaic technology through a perfluorination strategy.

         <title>Turning Waste into Treasure: Pretreatment Strategy for Promoting Secondary Grain Growth by Reusing Excess Lead Iodide in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pretreatment strategy of spin&#8208;coated quantum dots during the perovskite annealing process can use PbI2 as a raw material to promote the secondary growth of perovskite. Compared with the post&#8208;treatment strategy of passivating the perovskite surface after annealing, this approach is more innovative and effective at suppressing the influence of excessive PbI2 on the PCE and stability of perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells have witnessed remarkable progress in recent years, yet several pivotal factors persistently impede their widespread commercial adoption. Among these, the behavior of excess lead iodide (PbI2) during perovskite synthesis is particularly concerning. Excess PbI2 that promotes perovskite growth will accumulate at grain boundaries during annealing, which restricts the device performance and hinders its long&#8208;term applicability. In this work, an innovative pretreatment strategy is developed by depositing the Cs3ErCl6 quantum dots (QDs) on the perovskite film during annealing, which is different from the traditional post&#8208;treatment strategy by depositing QDs after annealing. It is evident that PbI2 can react with Cs3ErCl6 QDs, enabling its secondary utilization and promoting the secondary growth of perovskite in the vicinity of grain boundaries to inhibit the formation of excess PbI2. The pretreated perovskite layer has a better&#160;fit grain, resulting in higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) and better stability of the device. The (FAPbI3) 0.95(MAPbBr3) 0.05 perovskite solar cell treated using the pretreatment method demonstrates a champion PCE of 26.01%. This work offers new perspectives for inhibiting excessive PbI2 growth and thus holds great promise for advancing the commercial viability of perovskite solar cells and contributing to the future landscape of renewable energy.

         <title>Nanoporous Hydrogels with Tunable Pore Size for Efficient Hydrovoltaic Electricity Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoporous hydrogels with tunable pore sizes ranging from 78 to 161&#160;nm are developed using a hydrogen&#8208;bonding crosslinking strategy. The structural integrity of the hydrogel nanochannels under hydrated conditions is confirmed via cryo&#8208;electron microscopy. This work establishes a direct correlation between reduced pore size and enhanced streaming potential, providing new insights into the design of efficient hydrovoltaic materials.








Abstract
Hydrovoltaic electricity generators represent an emerging technology for converting low&#8208;grade water&#8208;based energy into electricity, and hydrogels are favored for their water absorption and ion&#8208;responsive properties. However, the controllable fabrication and precise micromorphological characterization of nanoporous hydrogels remain challenging, hindering the understanding of ion transport within confined water channels. In this work, a nanoporous hydrogel with tunable pore sizes is presented, developed through a multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding crosslinking strategy using &#947;&#8208;polyglutamic acid and hydroxylated carbon nanotubes. The pore size can be systematically tuned from 78 to 161&#160;nm, and cryo&#8208;electron microscopy confirms the presence of hydrated nanochannels. The results highlight the critical role of streaming potential in electricity generation, with the device achieving a threefold increase in voltage by reducing the pore size. The optimized device delivers an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.05&#160;V and a short&#8208;circuit current of 100&#160;&#181;A with a 0.1&#160;m NaCl droplet. Moreover,a practical application is demonstrated through a sweat&#8208;monitoring patch that visually responds to ion concentration changes. This work advances the design of high&#8208;efficiency hydrovoltaic systems by establishing a clear link between tunable nanoscale architecture and device performance, paving the way for scalable energy harvesting and sensing technologies.

         <title>Lattice&#8208;Matched Iridium on Vanadium Nitride as Efficient Hydrogen Electrocatalyst</title>

A lattice&#8208;matched molten co&#8208;growth strategy for constructing a controllable Ir structure with preferential active facet exposure on VN support, realizing highly efficient HOR/HER catalysis.








Abstract
Iridium (Ir), with optimal hydrogen binding energy (HBE) and hydroxyl bonding energy (OHBE), is considered a promising platform for achieving bi&#8208;directional hydrogen catalysis. However, traditional Ir&#8208;based catalysts with multiple crystalline facets exhibit a gap between the apparent activity and theoretical value, especially for the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). Here, a molten co&#8208;growth process of Ir and vanadium nitride (Ir&#8208;VN) is reported, realizing precise exposure of lattice&#8208;matched Ir (111) on VN with optimal HBE and OHBE, for highly active hydrogen catalysis. The Ir&#8208;VN catalyst demonstrates exceptional HOR activity with exchange currents 1.8&#8211;4.8 times higher than those of noble metal benchmark catalysts, as well as improved durability and CO tolerance. The unique lattice&#8208;matching effect promotes the directional electron transfer and induces shortened Ir&#9472;Ir bonds via the strongly coupled interface, therefore resulting in enhanced anti&#8208;oxidation and anti&#8208;CO capability. The Ir&#8208;VN catalyst also demonstrates great HER activity and operational durability in a wide pH range, requiring only 21, 12, and 82&#160;mV to reach 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline, acidic, and neutral conditions, respectively. This work not only deepens the understanding of hydrogen electrocatalysis mechanisms but also inspires the rational design and controllable synthesis of catalysts with active crystal facets for various applications.

Ultra&#8208;tough and impact&#8208;resistant poly(urea&#8208;urethane) plastics are fabricated by cross&#8208;linking soft polymer chains with multiple types of hydrogen bonds and hydrogen&#8208;bond aggregates with diverse binding energies and relaxation timescales. At &#8722;50 &#176;C, the plastic exhibits mechanical performance comparable to ultra&#8208;tough engineering plastics at ambient temperatures. The dynamic dissociation of hydrogen bonds endows PUU plastics with excellent low&#8208;temperature impact resistance.








Abstract
Traditional impact&#8208;resistant plastics become brittle at low temperatures due to restricted polymer chain mobility, rendering them unsuitable for cryogenic applications. Developing ultra&#8208;tough plastics with superior impact resistance under extreme low&#8208;temperature conditions remains a significant challenge. Here, this study reports the fabrication of ultra&#8208;tough, impact&#8208;resistant poly(urea&#8208;urethane) (PUU) plastics by cross&#8208;linking soft poly(tetramethylene ether glycol) (PTMEG) chains through multiple types of hydrogen bonds and hydrogen&#8208;bond aggregates with varying binding energies. The PUU plastic features a bicontinuous phase&#8208;separated nanostructure, where hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;cross&#8208;linked, rigid yet deformable domains are interpenetrated with soft PTMEG chains. At &#8722;50 &#176;C, the plastic exhibits mechanical properties comparable to those of ultra&#8208;tough, high&#8208;strength plastics at ambient temperature, with yield strength of 81.1&#160;MPa, breaking strength of 133.0&#160;MPa, Young's modulus of 1.5&#160;GPa, and breaking strain of 220.9%. A 0.3&#8208;mm&#8208;thick sample achieves a maximum impact force of 667.8 N and an impact energy of 3.8 J at &#8722;50 &#176;C, while maintaining exceptional mechanical robustness and flexibility even at &#8722;196 &#176;C. The low&#8208;temperature toughness and impact resistance of the PUU plastics surpass those of existing impact&#8208;resistant plastics. This study demonstrates that hydrogen bonds with a broad spectrum of binding energies serve as ideal cross&#8208;links for fabricating ultra&#8208;tough, impact&#8208;resistant plastics suitable for cryogenic applications.

Reticular porous functional materials, such as MOFs and COFs, toward selective and efficient radioactive waste&#8208;treatment.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;growing energy demand, driven by rapid industrialization and global urbanization, has escalated the development of sustainable nuclear power generation. Nuclear fission and fuel production generate several radioactive byproducts including 79Se, 85Kr, 90Sr, 99Tc, 127Xe, 129/131I, 137Cs, 235U, which pose great threat upon environmental infiltration. The sustainable development of nuclear energy relies on the easy and adequate accessibility of nuclear&#8208;fuels, like uranium, alongside safe and efficient management of the nuclear fuel cycles. To this end, reticular materials such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent&#8211;organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as versatile sorbent platforms for efficient treatment of various radionuclides owing to their structural tunability and target specificity. Given that momentous advances have been made in radionuclide treatment by reticular materials in the past few decades, it is important to systematically review and summarize the recent advancements in this field. In this review, a brief overview of the different classes of radioactive&#8208;wastes, and the principles of radioactive waste treatment is first presented. The prerequisites in materials designing are then discussed, followed by the recent progress in MOFs&#8208; and COFs&#8208;materials toward radioactive&#8208;waste&#8208;treatment. Finally, future perspectives on the unresolved scientific and technical challenges are proposed, aiming to fast&#8208;track the translation of these materials toward real&#8208;world implementation.

         <title>Smart Curtains for Spontaneous Solar Modulation via Natural Light&#8208;Triggered Deformable Shading and Chromogenic Synergy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a comprehensive approach is proposed for the development of deformable and optically modulated smart curtains, integrating stimulus&#8208;responsive chromogenic nanomaterials with photothermal actuators. By responding to external signals, the smart curtains can effectively regulate solar radiation by dynamically altering their shape while simultaneously modifying their optical properties, which solves the problem of persistent sunlight absorption caused by the installation of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state smart windows.








Abstract
Smart windows, fabricated from stimulus&#8208;responsive chromogenic materials, can modulate the transparency of a window toward sunlight to control room temperature. The widespread implementation of this technology can improve indoor comfort and effectively reduce energy consumption. However, due to their initial optical properties, chromogenic materials in solid&#8208;state smart windows continue to absorb sunlight, causing overcooling and temperature instability. Here, stimulus&#8208;responsive chromogenic nanowires (NWs) and photothermal actuators are combined to create flexible, macro&#8208;deformed smart curtains. The difference in thermal expansion coefficient between bacterial cellulose and polyethylene in actuators allows the smart curtains to keep curled at low light intensities (off&#8208;state) and unroll under intense light (on&#8208;state). The solar modulation efficiency is further enhanced by the synergy of chromogenic (thermochromic or photochromic) NWs. When rolled up, the smart curtains allow ample sunlight to pass through ordinary windows (92.0% of solar radiation) for heating. They can achieve temperature reductions exceeding 6.0&#160;&#176;C, attributed to the regulation of solar radiation, with 62.3% for thermochromic smart curtains and 79.1% for photochromic smart curtains. Besides, the smart curtains can be mounted directly on the building frame without replacing existing windows. These results illustrate the feasibility of smart curtains and represent a conspicuous step toward sustainable building technologies.

         <title>Regenerative Hydrovoltaic Power Generator with Remarkable Duration and Fast Power Generation Achieved by Deep Eutectic Biomass Complex</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomass&#8208;derived processing strategy forms the Deep Eutectic Biomass Complex that realizes fast power generation and long&#8208;term duration as a hydrovoltaic power generator.








Abstract
Hydrovoltaic power generators (HPGs) are pivotal for addressing the global energy crisis. However, most prevalent HPGs suffer from a conflict: either generating transient electricity or sustaining long&#8208;term output reliant on a continuous water supply, which would rapidly decay without water input, especially under low humidity. This severely restricts their environmental adaptability and durability, while the recyclability of HPGs is also highly concerned for reducing electronic waste. Herein, this work pioneers a biomass&#8208;derived processing strategy that forms a &#8220;Deep Eutectic Biomass Complex&#8221; (DEBC) via direct combining biomass macromolecules with choline chloride. The strategy constructed a stable yet sensitive hydrogen&#8208;bonded network that endows DEBC simultaneously realizing fast power generation and long&#8208;term duration as HPG. DEBC exhibits ultrahigh sensitivity to external humidity changes (&#8710;R/R&#8320;&#8776;265&#160;000%) and can spontaneously induce Grotthuss proton hopping under moisture flow, leading to rapid voltage generation (113.8 &#177; 11.5&#160;mV&#160;s&#8722;1). It also demonstrates exceptional durability that maintains an open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc&#8805; 400 &#160;mV) at 30%RH for over 10500 s without water input, and sustains Voc in an open environment for 25 days during winter. This work proposes a feasible access for designing renewable HPG with superior durability and environmental adaptability, tackling the operational limitations and sustainability concerns.

         <title>Quadruple Helix Inversions of Liquid Crystals Orchestrated by Direct Chirality Transmission of an Intrinsically Chiral Light&#8208;Driven Molecular Machine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular motor with four&#8208;state dynamic chirality is integrated into liquid crystals, enabling quadruple sequential helix inversions and high helical twisting power. Due to high motor efficiency, the supramolecular helicity can be controlled by near&#8208;infrared light via upconversion nanoparticles, resulting in a robust, multistate, photoresponsive soft matter. This concept provides new opportunities for programmable photonic smart materials.








Abstract
Endowing liquid crystal (LC) soft matter with stimuli&#8208;responsiveness is pivotal for programmable and dynamic photonics in the next generation of optical materials. However, suitable molecular candidates with intrinsic dynamic chirality that can twist LC helices using external stimuli in a multistate, distinct manner are still very rare. In this study, an elaborately designed intrinsically chiral molecular machine is presented with four&#8208;state dynamic chirality and mesogenic units. This design enables direct chirality transmission, leading to sequential quadruple helix inversions of the LC architecture via unidirectional rotary motion, achieving a high helical twisting power in all states. The inversion of the supramolecular helicity by near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light is demonstrated by NIR light&#8208;triggered isomerization of the molecular motor structure through an efficient radiative energy transfer pathway from upconversion nanoparticles in the LC film. Hence, these results demonstrate a unique photoresponsive LC system with high robustness, NIR light triggering, and multistate helix tunability with a fascinating potential for constructing smart optical devices.

         <title>Low&#8208;Voltage Driven Co&#8208;Production of Ammonia, Formate, and Hydrogen From Nitrite Reduction Coupled Formaldehyde Oxidation System on Ultra&#8208;Stable AuCuRh Nanowires under Illumination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect&#8208;rich AuCuRh nanowires with excellent self&#8208;stability enable the simultaneous nitrite electroreduction and formaldehyde electrooxidation, facilitating the co&#8208;production of ammonia, formate, and hydrogen at low operating potentials.








Abstract
The nitrite electroreduction reaction (NO2RR) offers a green and sustainable pathway for environmental wastewater treatment and ammonia (NH3) generation. Herein, defect&#8208;rich trimetallic AuCuRh nanowires (AuCuRh NWs) with a large number of grain boundaries, twin boundaries, and atomic steps are successfully synthesized by galvanic replacement reaction. Due to its self&#8208;stability and high activity, AuCuRh NWs can efficiently drive the stable NO2RR at 0&#160;V potential (Faradaic efficiency: 98.32%, NH3 yield rate: 20.49&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1). Moreover, AuCuRh NWs also reveal excellent electrocatalytic activity for the formaldehyde electrooxidation reaction (FOR), which can reach 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at only 0.35&#160;V potential. The NO2RR||FOR electrolysis system assembled with AuCuRh NWs requires only the electrolysis voltage of 0.38&#160;V to achieve the co&#8208;production of NH3, formate, and hydrogen and ultra&#8208;stable continuous electrolysis for 300&#160;hours. The NO2RR||FOR electrolysis system can be further decreased to only 0.29&#160;V under illumination due to plasmon&#8208;enhanced activity. This study provides an energy&#8208;efficient coupling strategy for the stable co&#8208;production of value&#8208;added chemicals.

         <title>An Ionomer&#8208;Free Gapless Catalyst&#8208;Bridging Membrane Electrode Assembly for High&#8208;Performance Pure Water&#8208;Fed Anion Exchange Membrane Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The GCB&#8208;AEMWE exhibits lower contact resistance, faster mass transfer kinetics, and stronger interfacial binding, thereby shows a high energy conversion efficiency of 85.7% at 1 A cm&#8722;2 and a voltage degradation rate of 65 &#181;V h&#8722;1 at 0.5 A cm&#8722;2 after 1&#8201;000 h, being the lowest reported to date for pure water&#8208;fed AEMWEs.








Abstract
Anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) are promising for hydrogen production due to low cost and high product purity. However, the performance of AEMWEs fed by pure water is unsatisfactory because of high ohmic resistance and sluggish reaction kinetics in the membrane electrode assembly (MEA). Here, an efficient ionomer&#8208;free gapless catalyst&#8208;bridging MEA (GCB&#8208;MEA) is developed for high&#8208;performance AEMWEs by confined directional deposition of the catalyst layer. The ionomer&#8208;free catalyst layer bridges the anion exchange membrane and the gas diffusion layer, creating robust interfaces at its both sides. Compared to conventional MEAs, the GCB&#8208;MEA exhibits more active sites, lower contact resistance, faster mass transfer kinetics, and stronger interfacial binding. The GCB&#8208;MEA&#8208;based AEMWE shows an energy conversion efficiency of 85.7% at 1 A cm&#8722;2 and a voltage degradation rate of 65 &#181;V h&#8722;1 at 0.5 A cm&#8722;2 after 1&#8201;000 h, being the lowest reported to date for pure water&#8208;fed AEMWEs. Moreover, the electrolyzer exhibits stable responses under the fluctuating solar energy supply conditions. This work provides an efficient strategy to prepare MEAs for high&#8208;performance hydrogen production, especially under pure water condition.

         <title>Beyond Enzyme Mimics: Engineering Photo&#8208;Responsive Nanozymes for Therapeutic Innovation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview of photo&#8208;responsive nanozymes, including structure&#8208;activity relationship, catalytic mechanism, and biomedical applications.








Abstract
Nanozymes, which mimic the catalytic functions of natural enzymes, have attracted increasing attention because of their high stability, low cost, and scalable synthesis. However, their clinical potential is often constrained by their limited catalytic efficiency and poor substrate specificity. Recent developments in photo&#8208;responsive nanozymes offer a promising solution by integrating photocatalytic and photo&#8208;synergistic mechanisms to enhance activity and spatiotemporal control. These systems utilize photo&#8208;induced charge separation, reactive oxygen species generation, and auxiliary photothermal or photodynamic effects to improve catalytic outcomes. By utilizing these photo&#8208;responsive mechanisms, various nanozyme systems comprising plasmonic metals, metal oxides, semiconductors, and metal&#8211;organic frameworks exhibit enhanced catalytic functions and outstanding therapeutic performance in cancer treatment, infection control, immune modulation, and tissue repair. This review summarizes recent advances in the design and application of photo&#8208;responsive nanozymes and highlights the remaining challenges for clinical translation, and thus positioning them as a next&#8208;generation strategy for precision biocatalysis and disease intervention.

         <title>Deterministic Printing of Single Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method has been developed for the additive manufacturing of single photon&#8208;emitting quantum dots and their deterministic positioning and heterointegration with photonic systems: single particle extraction electrodynamics (SPEED) printing. Using dielectrophoretics, polarizability contrast, and surface energetics, SPEED introduces a new, scalable, and sustainable platform for integrating complex photonic circuits and single photon&#8208;emitting quantum light sources with nanoscale precision.








Abstract
The unique optical properties of quantum dots (QDs), size&#8208;tunable emission, and high quantum yield make them ideal candidates for applications in secure quantum communication, quantum computing, targeted single&#8208;cell and molecular tagging, and sensing. Scalable and deterministic heterointegration strategies for single QDs have, however, remained largely out of reach due to inherent material incompatibilities with conventional semiconductor manufacturing processes. To advance scalable photonic quantum device architectures, it is therefore crucial to adopt placement and heterointegration strategies that can address these challenges. Here, an electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing model is presented, single particle extraction electrodynamics (SPEED) printing, that exploits a novel regime of nanoscale dielectrophoretics to print and deterministically position single colloidal QDs. Using QDs solubilized in apolar solvents, this additive, a near&#8208;zero&#8208;waste nanomanufacturing process, overcomes continuum fluid surface energetics and stochastic imprecision that limited previous colloidal deposition strategies, achieving selective extraction and deposition of individual QDs at sub&#8208;zeptoliter volumes. Photoluminescence and autocorrelation function (g(2)) measurements confirm nanophotonic cavity&#8208;QD integration and single&#8208;photon emission from single printed QDs. By enabling deterministic placement of single quantum dots, this method provides a powerful, scalable, and sustainable platform for integrating complex photonic circuits and quantum light sources with nanoscale precision.

         <title>Ionizable Coenzyme&#8208;Engineered Lipid/Fiber Microplexes Boost Ribosomal Translation to Improve mRNA Therapy for Degenerative Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, an injectable ionizable coenzyme Q10 (iCoQ10)&#8208;engineered lipid/fiber microplexes&#160;formulation is developed for mRNA therapy targeting degenerative diseases. iCoQ10 can substitute for conventional ionizable lipids to achieve stable mRNA loading. More importantly, after endocytosis, it rapidly re&#8208;functionalizes the inner mitochondrial membrane, inhibits the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, and suppresses eIF2&#945; phosphorylation to enhance ribosomal translation during mRNA delivery. This platform provides a novel strategy for mRNA therapy in degenerative diseases.








Abstract
Mitochondrial dysfunction&#8208;mediated ribosomal translation suppression is a hallmark of aging and a major driver of degenerative diseases, limiting mRNA therapy efficacy. Here, ionizable coenzyme Q10 (iCoQ10)&#8208;engineered lipid/fiber microplexes (iCLNP@SF) are developed that restore the mitochondrial&#8208;ribosomal axis to enhance mRNA translation. iCoQ10 replaces conventional ionizable lipids to form prodrugged lipid nanoparticles (iCLNP), stabilized by injectable polydopamine&#8209;modified short fibers for in situ administration. In vitro efficacy assessments showed that iCLNP@SF synergistically enhanced mitochondrial metabolism and mRNA translation in senescent cells. Further mechanistic studies revealed that iCLNP stabilized mitochondrial membrane potential, suppressed cGAS&#8208;STING activation, and reduced eIF2&#945; phosphorylation, thereby enhancing translation. In vivo, iCLNP@SF delivery of Gas6 mRNA increased hair follicle density by &#8776;50% in an androgenetic alopecia mouse model, while Runx2 mRNA delivery raised new bone formation (BV/TV) to &#8776;40% in defect models, both markedly outperforming conventional LNPs.

&lt;p&gt;In this study, an injectable ionizable coenzyme Q10 (iCoQ10)-engineered lipid/fiber microplexes&#160;formulation is developed for mRNA therapy targeting degenerative diseases. iCoQ10 can substitute for conventional ionizable lipids to achieve stable mRNA loading. More importantly, after endocytosis, it rapidly re-functionalizes the inner mitochondrial membrane, inhibits the cGAS-STING pathway, and suppresses eIF2&#945; phosphorylation to enhance ribosomal translation during mRNA delivery. This platform provides a novel strategy for mRNA therapy in degenerative diseases.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitochondrial dysfunction-mediated ribosomal translation suppression is a hallmark of aging and a major driver of degenerative diseases, limiting mRNA therapy efficacy. Here, ionizable coenzyme Q10 (iCoQ10)-engineered lipid/fiber microplexes (iCLNP@SF) are developed that restore the mitochondrial-ribosomal axis to enhance mRNA translation. iCoQ10 replaces conventional ionizable lipids to form prodrugged lipid nanoparticles (iCLNP), stabilized by injectable polydopamine&#8209;modified short fibers for in situ administration. In vitro efficacy assessments showed that iCLNP@SF synergistically enhanced mitochondrial metabolism and mRNA translation in senescent cells. Further mechanistic studies revealed that iCLNP stabilized mitochondrial membrane potential, suppressed cGAS-STING activation, and reduced eIF2&#945; phosphorylation, thereby enhancing translation. In vivo, iCLNP@SF delivery of Gas6 mRNA increased hair follicle density by &#8776;50% in an androgenetic alopecia mouse model, while Runx2 mRNA delivery raised new bone formation (BV/TV) to &#8776;40% in defect models, both markedly outperforming conventional LNPs. Together, these findings highlight a strategy that improves mRNA therapy for degenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This review reports the research progress of zeolite&#8208;anchored SACs in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions, and provides theoretical guidance for designing of zeolite&#8208;based catalysts at the atomic scale.








Abstract
Zeolite&#8208;anchored metal catalysts have shown promising applications in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions. However, difficulties such as high synthesis costs, inherent diffusion limitations, and stability issues have limited their large&#8208;scale industrial application. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), which provide the benefits of high atom utilization and excellent stability, have promising application prospects in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions. This review systematically reports the research progress of zeolite&#8208;anchored SACs in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions, summarizes the different synthesis methods, and proposes the regulation strategies to enhance the activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalysts for hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions, and provides theoretical guidance for designing of zeolite&#8208;based catalysts at the atomic scale. Finally, the potential opportunities and challenges of zeolite&#8208;anchored SACs in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions are prospected.

         <title>Thermal Expansion Matching as a Key Criterion for Developing High&#8208;Performance Mn&#8208;based Mullite Cathodes in SOFCs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared to conventional perovskite cathodes, the mullite&#8208;type material has a closely matched thermal expansion coefficient with yttria&#8208;stabilized zirconia (a deviation of 2.36% for SmMn2O5&#8208;Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 composite cathode), which enhances the cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface bonding, prevents interfacial mismatch at high temperatures, and thereby contributes to the long&#8208;term stable operation of the solid oxide fuel cells.








Abstract
Thermal expansion matching is crucial for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathode design to prevent interfacial delamination or cracking. This work adopts thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) matching as the primary design principle to enable both structural stability and high catalytic activity. A Mn&#8208;based mullite&#8208;type cathode, SmMn2O5 (SMO), is developed, and composite electrodes with Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 (GDC) are fabricated. To reveal the structure&#8211;property relationships, TEC and electrochemical performance measurements are combined with in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) analysis. SMO exhibited a low TEC (8.12 &#215; 10&#8722;6 K&#8722;1) due to anisotropic lattice expansion and phonon scattering confirmed by XRD and Raman. The SMO&#8211;GDC composite displayed extremely well&#8208;matched TECs with yttria&#8208;stabilized zirconia, with only 2.36% deviation across the operating range. Electrochemically, the composite cathode achieved 580.9&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 with polarization resistance of 0.193 &#937; cm2 and maintained stable operation for 300 h. DFT further revealed that GDC addition facilitated interfacial charge transfer and shortened Mn&#8211;Mn dimers, explaining the enhanced catalytic activity. This cathode material selection strategy, prioritizing TEC matching as the primary principle, provides a new insight into SOFC cathode development.

         <title>Immuno&#8208;Packed T&#8208;Cell&#8208;Fusogenic Liposome Empowers Adoptive T Cell Therapy for Solid Tumor Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An immuno&#8208;packed T&#8208;cell&#8208;fusogenic liposome (IMPACTFUL) platform is developed to engineer T cells to overcome solid tumor challenges. Using membrane fusion, it simultaneously confers three abilities in one step: enhanced tumor infiltration, immune tolerance evasion, and tumor microenvironment modulation. This approach offers a promising T cell engineering strategy, potentially broadening adoptive T cell therapy's scope against solid tumors.









Abstract
Adoptive T cell therapy has achieved remarkable success in certain blood cancers, but&#160;its efficacy against solid tumors remains limited by multiple immunological challenges including inadequate tumor infiltration, tumor cell's immune tolerance, and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, a one&#8208;step cell engineering strategy is reported to enhance T cell therapy for solid tumors using an immuno&#8208;packed T&#8208;cell&#8208;fusogenic liposome (IMPACTFUL). Through membrane fusion, IMPACTFUL simultaneously decorates therapeutic T cells with DPPA peptides on their surface and delivers interleukin&#8208;12 mRNA&#8208;loaded magnetic nanoparticle cores (MNP/IL&#8208;12) into the cytoplasm. MNP/IL&#8208;12 internalization grants T cells with effective tumor targeting under external magnet and TME reversion through IL&#8208;12 expression. DPPA peptide presentation enables T cells to overcome tumor cells&#8217; immune tolerance through PD&#8208;L1 checkpoint blockade. In a murine solid tumor model, IMPACTFUL&#8208;engineered T cells infiltrate tumors more effectively, resist exhaustion, and induce a more pro&#8208;inflammatory TME, leading to significantly suppressed tumor growth compared to unmodified T cells. Together, IMPACTFUL can empower adoptive T cell therapy by endowing T cells with multiple complementary functions in a single step. This approach offers a versatile platform to improve the therapeutic outcomes of T cell therapies against solid tumors and can accelerate their translation to clinical settings.

         <title>3D Spatiotemporal Electrophysiology of Cardiac Organoids Using Shell Microelectrode Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D spatiotemporal activation and conduction velocity mapping of whole cardiac organoids of various sizes is demonstrated using a novel organoid&#8208;encapsulating shell microelectrode array (MEA). The device's programmable shape transformation enables noninvasive, conformal, and stable contact with suspended organoids, facilitating long&#8208;term electrophysiological monitoring with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios. The shell MEA is optically transparent and fabricated entirely on&#8208;chip using standard photolithographic techniques, enabling simultaneous optical imaging and scalable high&#8208;throughput manufacturing.








Abstract
Cardiac organoids have emerged as powerful platforms for modeling human heart development and disease. However, traditional 2D microelectrode arrays (MEAs) are limited to planar recordings and fail to capture the 3D propagation of electrical signals. Here, programmable, shape&#8208;adaptive, organoid&#8208;encapsulating shell MEAs are presented as a technology that enables comprehensive 3D electrophysiological mapping. These on&#8208;chip&#8208;fabricated devices feature customizable geometries and electrode layouts tailored to an organoid's unique morphology. Shell MEAs generate high&#8208;resolution 3D isochrone and conduction velocity maps, unveiling long&#8208;term spatiotemporal field potential dynamics in spontaneously beating organoids. Furthermore, they integrate multiple modalities, such as&#160;calcium imaging&#160;to corroborate electrophysiological findings and pharmacological screening to assess organoid responses to isoproterenol, E&#8208;4031, and serotonin. This platform represents a significant advance in bioelectronic interfaces, enabling high&#8208;content 3D spatiotemporal functional analysis for cardiac disease modeling and pharmacological testing.

Exploring reliable electrolytes and constructing favorable SEI structure are pivotal for advancing calcium metal batteries. A strongly solvated and alkaxyborate anion mediated electrolyte demonstrates ultra&#8208;stable Ca metal anodes for over 1450&#160;h. This electrolyte derives an organic (outer)&#8208;inorganic (inner) bi&#8208;layered SEI that facilitates Ca ion migration for Ca metal plating/stripping reactions.








Abstract
Calcium (Ca) metal battery is a promising alternative to current lithium battery chemistry due to the high crustal abundance of Ca element and potentially dendrite&#8208;free cycling of high&#8208;capacity Ca metal anodes. However, reversible Ca metal stripping and plating have been hindered by the lack of effective electrolytes and the formation of obstructive solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers. Here a strongly coordinated electrolyte system by incorporating LiB(hfip)4 into Ca[B(hfip)4]2/glyme solutions is introduced. The highly coordinated glyme molecules and B(hfip)4&#8722; anions are ready to decompose into organic rich compounds and CaH2, CaB2O4 nanocrystals in the SEI layers on Ca metal surface. Transmission electron microscopy observations reveal that these ionically conductive inorganic particles are embedded beneath the organic&#8208;rich outer layer, thus forming a bilayer SEI configuration. This unique structure facilitates efficient Ca&#8208;ion transfer while preventing further electrolyte decomposition. Effectiveness of this electrolyte is evidenced by the ultrastable Ca//Ca symmetrical cells (over 1450&#160;h with low potentials of &lt;0.5&#160;V vs. Ca/Ca2+ at a high current density of 2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and the high&#8208;energy Ca//polyaniline full cells (energy densities of above 200&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 over 200 cycles), which set new benchmarks in the field of room&#8208;temperature Ca metal batteries.

         <title>From Ambiguity to Application: Deciphering Non&#8208;Radical Pathways in Heterogeneous Persulfate Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review deciphers the complexity of non&#8208;radical pathways in persulfate&#8208;based heterogeneous advanced oxidation processes. By integrating singlet oxygen, high&#8208;valent metal&#8211;oxo species, electron transfer and polymerization mechanisms, it establishes a unified framework linking catalyst design, pollutant properties and operation parameters, providing a unified framework to tune pathway selectivity and guide application&#8208;oriented water treatment.








Abstract
Non&#8208;radical pathways have emerged as a critical research frontier in persulfate&#8208;based heterogeneous advanced oxidation processes (PS&#8208;HAOPs), offering superior selectivity and thereby resistance to background interference compared to conventional radical&#8208;based routes. However, the practical implementation remains hindered by mechanistic ambiguities, stemming from the coexistence of multiple reactive species and difficulty in direct verification. Current studies remain fragmented, lacking a unified framework to connect catalyst properties, operational parameters, and dominant oxidation mechanisms. This review examines the formation mechanism, identification methodologies, and reactivity patterns of non&#8208;radical species, such as singlet oxygen, high&#8208;valent metal oxide species, and electron transfer pathways. Particular emphasis is placed on rational catalyst design strategies, including spin&#8208;state tuning, coordination environment manipulation, and structural engineering, which directly modulate the steric and electronic structures of active sites and thereby influence the dominant oxidation pathway and overall catalytic efficiency. By integrating insights into temporal evolution, multi&#8208;pathway coupling, and polymerization behavior, a comprehensive model that links catalyst properties, operational conditions, and pollutant characteristics to pathway selectivity is formulated. This review provides mechanistic clarity and design principles to guide the future development of controllable, efficient, and application&#8208;oriented non&#8208;radical PS&#8208;HAOPs systems.

         <title>Modulating Adsorption Configurations of Hybrid Self&#8208;assembled Molecules Enables High&#8208;performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;4&#8208;sulfanylbenzoic acid (BSCA) incorporation induces a reorientation of [4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)butyl]phosphonic acid (Ph&#8208;4PACz)&#160;molecules on substrate from a lying&#8208;down to a standing&#8208;up geometry. The co&#8208;adsorption strategy not only resulted in a more homogeneous Ph&#8208;4PACz coverage with optimized energy alignment, but also improved the uniformity of the buried surface of perovskite films with inhibited interfacial non&#8208;radiative recombination. Consequently, a high efficiency&#160;of 26.72% (certified 26.75%) is realized for the BSCA&#8208;based device.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs) as hole&#8208;selective layers have achieved tremendous success in perovskite solar cells. However, the effective modulation of the adsorption configuration of hybrid SAMs on indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates remains a challenge, which essentially influences the SAM's orientation and homogeneity. Herein, the adsorption configuration of [4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)butyl]phosphonic acid (Ph&#8208;4PACz) on the ITO surface is modulated with co&#8208;assembled molecules 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoroterephthalic acid (BCA) or 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;4&#8208;sulfanylbenzoic acid (BSCA). Specifically, planar BCA molecules anchored via bi&#8208;carboxylic groups stabilize Ph&#8208;4PACz in a tilted configuration, forming an angle of approximately 54.03&#176; relative to the ITO surface, whereas tilted BSCA molecules anchored via mono&#8208;carboxylic groups induce Ph&#8208;4PACz to adopt an almost perpendicular orientation relative to the ITO surface. Upon BSCA introduction, the Ph&#8208;4PACz film becomes more uniform with better energy level alignment, which further results in the enhanced homogeneity of the buried surface of perovskite films with enhanced charge transport and reduced interfacial non&#8208;radiative recombination losses. Consequently, the resultant BSCA&#8208;based devices achieve a high efficiency of 26.72% (certified 26.75%) for devices with the active area of 0.0717 cm2 and 25.21% for 1 cm2, respectively, maintaining over 90% of their initial efficiencies after 1,500 h operational tracking under illumination or 1000 h at 85 &#176;C heating.

         <title>Novel Sodium Rare Earth Silicate Solid Electrolyte with Grain Boundary Electronic Insulation for Ultra&#8208;Durable Solid&#8208;State Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a facile grain boundary modification strategy is conducted by introducing a second phase of Na1.5Y2.5F9 into the grain boundaries of the Na5YSi4O12 solid electrolyte. Thus, ultra&#8208;durable solid&#8208;state sodium metal batteries are achieved.








Abstract
Sodium rare earth silicate is regarded as a novel and promising solid electrolyte (SE) for solid&#8208;state sodium metal batteries (SSSMBs) because the merits of high ionic conductivity, low sintering temperature, and excellent chemical stability. However, impurity phases and voids induced by sintering always cause weak ion conduction and large electron conduction at grain boundaries, resulting in the growth of Na dendrites. Herein, a facile grain boundary modification strategy is conducted by introducing a second phase of Na1.5Y2.5F9 into the grain boundaries of Na5YSi4O12. The Na1.5Y2.5F9 phase can not only effectively impede the migration of electrons and reduce the bulk resistance and grain boundary resistance, but also improve the densification and mechanical strength of SE. Consequently, the Na/Na symmetric cell delivers a large critical current density of 0.7&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and an ultra&#8208;long cycle life of 9000&#160;h at 0.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 0.05 mAh cm&#8722;2 without dendrite formation. Moreover, the assembled full cell achieves excellent cycling stability at 1 C for 750 cycles with a capacity retention of 70.2% and enhanced rate capability of 113.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 2 C. This work lays a foundation to develop high&#8208;performance sodium rare earth silicate&#8208;based SE for ultra&#8208;durable SSSMBs.

         <title>High&#8208;CRI White Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Transistors with Ultrathin Emissive Layers for Full&#8208;Color Display</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;CRI white OLETs are realized by incorporating ultrathin yellow and red phosphorescent emitters into a blue TADF layer, achieving a CRI of 92&#8212;the highest among UEML devices. Leveraging this performance, a 12&#160;&#215;&#160;20 array serves as a planar backlight, delivering vivid full&#8208;color images with clear spatial definition and a wide color gamut covering 117% of the NTSC standard.








Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting transistors (OLETs) have attracted increasing interest as promising multifunctional three&#8208;terminal optoelectronic devices for next&#8208;generation active&#8208;matrix flat&#8208;panel displays. The development of high color rendering index (CRI) white OLETs is essential for full&#8208;color display applications demanding excellent color fidelity. However, it remains challenging with the conventional approach of doping multiple guest emitters into a host matrix, requiring precise control needed over doping concentrations. Herein, a strategy is presented to fabricate high&#8208;CRI white OLETs using ultrathin emissive layers (UEMLs). This approach enables simple fabrication and efficient exciton management through 2D energy transfer across adjacent layers. The integrated OLET architecture uniquely combines electrical switching with high&#8208;quality white light emission. The resulting devices incorporating thickness&#8208;optimized yellow and red UEMLs exhibit uniform area emission with a low turn&#8208;on voltage below 6&#160;V and a CRI exceeding 90. These are amongst the best performance values reported to date for ultrathin non&#8208;doped electroluminescent devices. Furthermore, a 12&#160;&#215;&#160;20 OLET pixel array is fabricated and employed as a planar backlight, enabling a color gamut coverage of 117% of the national television standards committee (NTSC) standard and vivid full&#8208;color image display. This work provides a promising pathway for scalable, high&#8208;quality full&#8208;color OLET displays.

&lt;p&gt;High-CRI white OLETs are realized by incorporating ultrathin yellow and red phosphorescent emitters into a blue TADF layer, achieving a CRI of 92&#8212;the highest among UEML devices. Leveraging this performance, a 12&#160;&#215;&#160;20 array serves as a planar backlight, delivering vivid full-color images with clear spatial definition and a wide color gamut covering 117% of the NTSC standard.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically thin 2D metals exhibit unique structural, electronic, and physicochemical features distinct from conventional bulk or nanostructure counterparts. This review categorises their crystalline configurations, elaborates topotactic, top&#8208;down, and bottom&#8208;up synthetic strategies, and explores structure&#8208;property correlations through doping, heterostructures, and phase/strain engineering. These insights highlight emerging functionalities in catalysis, electronics, quantum transport, and biointerfaces enabled by &#229;ngstr&#246;m&#8208;scale design.








Abstract
Atomically thin 2D metals, also termed metallenes, constitute a distinctive class of 2D materials in which metallic bonding is preserved at the &#229;ngstr&#246;m scale. Quantum confinement imparts ultrahigh carrier mobility, tunable plasmonic resonances, and exposed surfaces composed of low&#8208;coordination active sites. Although &#8220;2D metals&#8221; have historically encompassed various metallic nanostructures, recent breakthroughs have enabled the isolation of structurally well&#8208;defined metallenes with ambient stability and quantum&#8208;confined properties not observed in their bulk counterparts. This review provides a comprehensive overview of metallene research, focusing on their synthetic chemistry, low&#8208;dimensional metrics, and structure&#8208;function relationships. This unified framework provides cross&#8208;disciplinary insights for rational design in catalysis, plasmonics, electronics, and biomedical applications. Rigorous criteria are first established to distinguish true monolayer metals from quasi&#8208;2D nanosheets, emphasizing bonding anisotropy, lattice continuity, and spectroscopic fingerprints. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art fabrication strategies are then benchmarked for scalability and technology readiness. Next, the engineering toolbox, including doping, hierarchical hetero&#8208;structuring, and defect/phase/strain modulation, is surveyed, which tailors these intrinsic traits and translates them into record performances across diverse applications. Finally, outstanding challenges, including thermodynamic metastability, limited synthetic precision, unclear dynamic structure&#8208;function relationships, and device integration, and delineate research directions aimed at accelerating the rational design and practical implementation of metallenes are outlined.

         <title>Ductile Inorganic Ferromagnetic Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Current plastic inorganic semiconductors remain scarce, with functionalities limited to electrical and thermal properties. Herein, the first ductile inorganic ferromagnetic semiconductor CrSiTe3 with exceptional room&#8208;temperature plasticity (12% tensile strain) and robust ferromagnetism below 34&#160;K is reported. Theoretical calculations reveal that interlayer slip enables deformability while preserving magnetic order. This study significantly expands the functionality of plastic inorganic semiconductors. 








Abstract
Ductile/Plastic inorganic semiconductors have garnered significant attention for their potential in flexible electronics, yet their current diversity remains limited, with functionalities largely confined to thermal and/or electrical properties. Here, the first intrinsically ductile/plastic inorganic ferromagnetic semiconductor, bulk CrSiTe3 van der Waals (vdW) crystals, which combine excellent deformability with ferromagnetism, is reported. Mechanical characterization reveals excellent plasticity at room temperature, with CrSiTe3 crystals sustaining up to 12% tensile strain, surpassing many existing plastic bulk vdW semiconductors. Below the Curie temperature of 34&#160;K, the material retains ferromagnetic ordering, with plasticity exerting negligible effects on Curie temperature or saturation magnetization. First&#8208;principles calculations attribute the exceptional deformability to low interlayer slip energy barriers and high cleavage energy within Te&#8208;terminated vdW layers, enabling interlayer gliding without fracture. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that interlayer slip minimally perturbs magnetic interactions, preserving ferromagnetism. This work bridges the gap between mechanical plasticity, semiconductivity, and ferromagnetism in a single material, extending the functionality of plastic inorganic semiconductors.

         <title>Graphene&#8211;Vanadium Oxide Heterojunction Boosting Electron&#8211;Ion Coupling for Ultrahigh Energy Density Carbon Fiber Structural Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work pioneers the design of ultrahigh&#8208;energy&#8208;density carbon fiber structural supercapacitors using H2V3O8/rGO electrode coating. Density functional theory calculations and kinetic analyses reveales the underlying mechanism. Comprehensive evaluations highly relevant to practical applications are carried out, including mechanical tensile tests, as well as electrochemical behavior under compressive loading (0&#8211;120&#160;kPa) and even structural damage conditions. 








Abstract
The rapid advancement of drone logistics and electric aviation has created a growing demand for carbon fiber structural supercapacitors (CF&#8211;SSCs) that combine energy storage with lightweight and structural functionality. However, achieving high energy density remains challenging due to the chemical inertness of carbon fiber. In this work, it is demonstrated that H2V3O8/rGO is a promising and high&#8208;performance electrode coating for carbon fiber structural supercapacitors that possess both ultrahigh energy density and load&#8208;bearing functionality. Herein, a simple and efficient one&#8208;step high&#8208;temperature mixing hydrothermal method is developed to synthesize H2V3O8/rGO. Density functional theory calculations reveal that strong interfacial synergy between rGO and H2V3O8 promotes electron transport and Li+ diffusion, boosting efficient electron&#8211;ion coupling. The device exhibits high capacitance (964&#160;mF&#160;g&#8722;1) and exceptional energy density (502.1&#160;mWh&#160;kg&#8722;1), exceeding previously reported values. Remarkably, it maintains 88% capacitance retention after 5&#8201;000 cycles at 3&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 under a compressive load of 120&#160;kPa, exceeding the 83% retention without load, demonstrating excellent electrochemical load&#8208;bearing stability. In addition, the device shows robust mechanical properties (127.2&#160;MPa tensile strength, 6.95&#160;GPa tensile modulus) and high safety, offering strong potential for practical application. This study proposes a promising strategy for designing CF&#8211;SSCs with high energy density.

         <title>High Iontronic Performance in Organic Electrochemical Transistors Enabled by Intramolecular Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The limited transconductance of OECTs has hindered their development in bioelectronics. To address this issue, a molecular design strategy is developed involving finely tuning the intramolecular noncovalent interactions within the active layer. Consequently, transconductance increases with increasing the interaction strength, with a record&#8208;high geometry&#8208;normalized transconductance of 415&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 being achieved.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) show great potential in bioelectronics due to their iontronic coupling, low driving voltages (&lt;1&#8201;V), and biocompatibility. Nevertheless, their low iontronic performance, particularly in terms of transconductance (gm), limits their ability to acquire high&#8208;precision biosignals. To address this issue, a series of poly(bithiophene)s (opg2T&#8208;O, opg2T&#8208;S, and opg2T&#8208;Se) bearing 4,4&#8242;&#8208;position glycol side chains are synthesized. Upon varying furan, thiophene, and selenophene comonomers, the intramolecular noncovalent interactions are systematically tuned. Comprehensive theoretical analyses reveal that opg2T&#8208;Se demonstrates stronger intramolecular Se&#183;&#183;&#183;O noncovalent interactions than the S&#183;&#183;&#183;O interactions in opg2T&#8208;S and opg2T&#8208;O, affording a more planar and rigid molecular configuration in opg2T&#8208;Se. Meanwhile, opg2T&#8208;Se exhibits closer &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and lamellar&#8208;packing and prefers an edge&#8208;on orientation. Consequently, a record&#8208;high geometry&#8208;normalized transconductance (gm,n) of 415&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1, along with remarkable hole mobility (&#181; = 2.99&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1) and volumetric capacitance (C* = 423.3&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;3) are achieved in opg2T&#8208;Se based OECTs. Importantly, the opg2T&#8208;Se&#8208;based devices exhibits much higher signal fidelity in in&#8208;vitro human electrocardiogram (ECG) than the other two devices.

     alt="High Iontronic Performance in Organic Electrochemical Transistors Enabled by Intramolecular Noncovalent Interactions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limited transconductance of OECTs has hindered their development in bioelectronics. To address this issue, a molecular design strategy is developed involving finely tuning the intramolecular noncovalent interactions within the active layer. Consequently, transconductance increases with increasing the interaction strength, with a record-high geometry-normalized transconductance of 415&#160;S&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; being achieved.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) show great potential in bioelectronics due to their iontronic coupling, low driving voltages (&amp;lt;1&#8201;V), and biocompatibility. Nevertheless, their low iontronic performance, particularly in terms of transconductance (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;), limits their ability to acquire high-precision biosignals. To address this issue, a series of poly(bithiophene)s (opg2T-O, opg2T-S, and opg2T-Se) bearing 4,4&#8242;-position glycol side chains are synthesized. Upon varying furan, thiophene, and selenophene comonomers, the intramolecular noncovalent interactions are systematically tuned. Comprehensive theoretical analyses reveal that opg2T-Se demonstrates stronger intramolecular Se&#183;&#183;&#183;O noncovalent interactions than the S&#183;&#183;&#183;O interactions in opg2T-S and opg2T-O, affording a more planar and rigid molecular configuration in opg2T-Se. Meanwhile, opg2T-Se exhibits closer &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;&lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt; stacking and lamellar-packing and prefers an edge-on orientation. Consequently, a record-high geometry-normalized transconductance (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m,n&lt;/sub&gt;) of 415&#160;S&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, along with remarkable hole mobility (&lt;i&gt;&#181;&lt;/i&gt; = 2.99&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and volumetric capacitance (&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;* = 423.3&#160;F&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;) are achieved in opg2T-Se based OECTs. Importantly, the opg2T-Se-based devices exhibits much higher signal fidelity in in-vitro human electrocardiogram (ECG) than the other two devices. This study highlights the importance of intramolecular noncovalent interaction in the channel layer materials for achieving high-performance OECTs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Deep Learning&#8208;Enhanced High&#8208;Precision Wind Field Concurrent Triboelectric Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;powered MVTS enables 360&#176; wind sensing via vortex&#8208;induced vibration, magnetic tuning, and triboelectric transduction. Dual&#8208;channel frequency decoding and a Regression Transformer achieve &lt;5% wind speed and &lt;1&#176; direction errors. Material and charge stability are enhanced via interface optimization and electrostatic compensation. The system shows robust performance under &#8722;28&#160;&#176;C and sandstorm conditions, offering an integrated solution for intelligent wind monitoring in harsh environments.








Abstract
Reliable and real&#8208;time wind field sensing is critical for environmental monitoring and distributed meteorological forecasting. However, conventional solutions often suffer from structural complexity and poor adaptability to harsh environments. In this work, a magneto&#8208;vortex triboelectric sensing system (MVTS) is developed by coupling a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) with a vortex&#8208;induced vibration (VIV) structure and magnetically reinforced elastic elements. The system converts wind&#8208;induced oscillations into electrical signals and supports full 360&#176; wind direction decoding through a dual&#8208;channel frequency difference mechanism. Material&#8208;level optimization using FEP, nylon, and rabbit&#8208;fur electrostatic compensation enhances environmental resilience and long&#8208;term signal stability. A deep learning model, Regression Transformer (ReT), is constructed to extract temporal and frequency domain features from multichannel TENG signals, enabling high&#8208;accurate prediction of wind speed and direction. Controlled indoor experiments confirm a maximum wind speed error of 0.69&#160;m&#160;s&#8722;1, with prediction errors consistently below 5% and a wind direction error within 1&#176;. Additional validations under &#8722;28&#160;&#176;C low&#8208;temperature conditions and wind&#8208;sand environments demonstrate the system's robust operation and strong environmental adaptability. This work provides a resilient, intelligent, and fully integrated solution for autonomous wind field monitoring in data&#8208;scarce, infrastructure&#8208;limited, and extreme outdoor scenarios.

         <title>PiP&#8208;Plex: A Particle&#8208;in&#8208;Particle System for Multiplexed Quantification of Proteins Secreted by Single Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detecting proteins secreted by a single cell while retaining its viability remains challenging. A particles&#8208;in&#8208;particle (PiPs) system made by co&#8208;encapsulating barcoded microparticles (BMPs) with a single cell inside an alginate hydrogel particle is introduced. Multiple proteins secreted by single cells (PiP&#8208;plex) are quantified via sandwich immunoassays on the BMPs by fluorescence confocal microscopy, while keeping cells alive and retrievable.








Abstract
Cell signaling is modulated by the secretion of various proteins, which can be used to infer a cell's phenotype. However, these proteins cannot be readily detected in multiplex by commonly used methods at the single&#8208;cell level. Here we present PiP&#8208;plex a particles&#8208;in&#8208;particle (PiPs) system for multiplex protein secretion analysis by confocal microscopy. PiP&#8208;plex&#8208;comprises (i) fluorescence intensity barcoded microparticles (BMPs) co&#8208;entrapped with (ii) a single cell inside an alginate hydrogel particle. We found that PiPs maintained &gt;90% cellular viability and allowed live cells retrieval. A seven&#8208;plex fluorescent barcoding and concomitant sandwich immunoassay in PiPs was developed with limits of detection ranging from 0.8 pg mL&#8722;1 to 2&#160;ng mL&#8722;1 depending on the protein. PiP&#8208;plex assays were benchmarked with bulk immunoassays and found to rival or outperform them. Proteins secreted by single THP&#8208;1 cells upon exposure to lipopolysaccharide were measured by PiP&#8208;plex and varying cell responses detected, including a significant increase in MIP&#8208;1&#945;, TNF&#8208;&#945;, and IL&#8208;17A; MIP&#8208;1&#945; and IL&#8208;17A were the most frequently secreted cytokines, while other cytokines were typically co&#8208;secreted. Using PiP&#8208;plex, we analyzed &#8776;750 THP&#8208;1 cells, showcasing its potential for characterizing cells and cell&#8208;based therapeutics for e.g. cancer immunotherapies.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Dependent Excitonic States in Twisted Bilayer WSe2/Fe5GeTe2 Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel spin&#8208;dependent hybrid exciton T* is identified in both 3R and 2H&#8208;BL WSe2/FGT heterostructures. It originates from the coupling between the injected spin&#8208;polarized electrons from FGT and the neutral excitons in BL WSe2 under the spin&#8208;cross&#8208;polarized band mechanism. Furthermore, the T* exciton coupling strength variation stems from distinct twisted BL WSe2 stacking symmetries.








Abstract
Twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have generated diverse unusual electrical and optical phenomena and can provide a powerful platform for designing nanodevices with tunable interlayer interaction. Striving to explore novel excitons with spin response in these semiconductor systems is highly desirable, as they highlight the possibility to access complex electronic band structure and magneto&#8208;exciton effect, thereby facilitating efficient spin&#8208;based information storage via exciton degrees of freedom. Here, fabrication of bilayer WSe2/Fe5GeTe2 (FGT) heterostructures with different stacking phases is reported, and a new hybridized excitonic state T* is defined in both 3R and 2H bilayer WSe2, which exhibits strong correlations dependent on the FGT spin order. This spin&#8208;dependent hybridized exciton is demonstrated to originate from the coupling between injected spin&#8208;polarized electrons and neutral excitons, because of the spin&#8208;cross&#8208;polarized band that obstructs the normal electron&#8211;hole annihilation process. Besides, the difference in the coupling strength of the T* exciton attributed to the distinct stacking symmetries in twisted bilayer WSe2 is further unveiled. These findings open an accessible avenue for designing tailored excitonic states in twisted bilayers, thus offering prospects for the future applications of stacking&#8208;engineered opto&#8208;spintronics at the integration level.

         <title>Bioinspired Swelling&#8208;Deswelling Strategy Unlocks Synergistic Molecular Solar Thermal&#8208;Fabric Systems for Personal Thermal Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by Atriplex centralasiatica's salt secretion, a swelling&#8208;deswelling strategy for hollow aerogel fibers (HAFs) is developed to create synergistically promoted MOST&#8208;fabric systems (SPMFS), resolving interfacial incompatibility between MOST molecules and fabrics. SPMFS exhibits enhanced mechanical robustness, photothermal performance, and good durability under cyclic stretching, rubbing, and washing, paving the way for next&#8208;generation wearable personal thermal management (PTM) systems.








Abstract
Molecular solar thermal (MOST) fabrics represent a transformative approach to personal thermal management (PTM) through their capability to control the storage and release of solar energy. Nevertheless, the critical challenge of interfacial incompatibility between MOST molecules and fabrics persists, resulting in compromised robustness and suboptimal energy conversion efficiency. Here, inspired by the salt absorption&#8208;secretion mechanism of Atriplex centralasiatica, an innovative swelling&#8208;deswelling strategy tailored for hollow aerogel fibers (HAFs) is developed, creating a synergistically promoted MOST&#8208;fabric system (SPMFS) with concurrent enhancements in mechanical robustness and photothermal performance. During the swelling&#8208;deswelling process, thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) chains undergo reorganization into a densified network, while the simultaneous secretion of azobenzene (Azo) forms dense, uniform monocrystalline layers. The resultant SPMFS exhibits notable mechanical improvements, with a 48% increase in breaking strain and 129% enhancement in tensile strength. Equally striking are its photothermal capabilities, achieving an enhanced photo&#8208;charging and photo&#8208;discharging (&gt;94% photoconversion) alongside a uniformly distributed high energy density of 7.5 kJ m&#8722;2. Moreover, the SPMFS enables programmable rapid thermal management, showcases impressive durability under long&#8208;term washing, cyclic stretching, and rubbing, and realizes controllable photothermal physiotherapy. This bioinspired strategy lays the groundwork for next&#8208;generation wearable PTM systems and establishes a framework for future PTM device design

&lt;p&gt;Molecular solar thermal (MOST) fabrics represent a transformative approach to personal thermal management (PTM) through their capability to control the storage and release of solar energy. Nevertheless, the critical challenge of interfacial incompatibility between MOST molecules and fabrics persists, resulting in compromised robustness and suboptimal energy conversion efficiency. Here, inspired by the salt absorption-secretion mechanism of &lt;i&gt;Atriplex centralasiatica&lt;/i&gt;, an innovative swelling-deswelling strategy tailored for hollow aerogel fibers (HAFs) is developed, creating a synergistically promoted MOST-fabric system (SPMFS) with concurrent enhancements in mechanical robustness and photothermal performance. During the swelling-deswelling process, thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) chains undergo reorganization into a densified network, while the simultaneous secretion of azobenzene (Azo) forms dense, uniform monocrystalline layers. The resultant SPMFS exhibits notable mechanical improvements, with a 48% increase in breaking strain and 129% enhancement in tensile strength. Equally striking are its photothermal capabilities, achieving an enhanced photo-charging and photo-discharging (&amp;gt;94% photoconversion) alongside a uniformly distributed high energy density of 7.5 kJ m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, the SPMFS enables programmable rapid thermal management, showcases impressive durability under long-term washing, cyclic stretching, and rubbing, and realizes controllable photothermal physiotherapy. This bioinspired strategy lays the groundwork for next-generation wearable PTM systems and establishes a framework for future PTM device design&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Zone Chloride Engineering to Enable Ultra&#8208;Stable Two&#8208;Electron Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

Here, the polyiodide desorption effect induced by high&#8208;concentration ZnCl2 electrolytes within organic iodine hosts is elucidated. By coupling hydrophobic chloride salt&#8208;reconstructed cathodes with high&#8208;voltage chloride&#8208;deficient electrolytes, this effect is effectively eliminated while solving the limited reversibility of two&#8208;electron iodine conversion process, thereby realizing ultra&#8208;stable high&#8208;energy zinc&#8208;iodine batteries (up to 35,000 cycles).








Abstract
Zinc&#8208;iodine batteries (ZIBs) with organic iodine hosts that harness the I&#8722;/I+ conversion offer a promising route to high&#8208;energy storage but remain limited by rapid capacity decay. Conventional approaches employing high&#8208;concentration ZnCl2 electrolytes effectively activate I&#8722;/I+ conversion in carbon hosts but prove incompatible with organic systems. Here, its excess free Cl&#8722; is identified to displace polyiodide from organic iodine hosts, thereby triggering an irreversible I&#8722;/I+ process. To address this, a dual&#8208;zone chloride engineering strategy is introduced that spatially separates chloride environments into complementary domains. At the cathode, a non&#8208;dissociative hydrophobic salt (trioctylmethylammonium chloride) establishes a confined Cl&#8722;&#8208;rich, water&#8208;deficient environment, suppressing polyiodide desorption and preventing hydrolytic I&#8314; decomposition. In the electrolyte, a chloride&#8208;liberating salt (0.2 m ZnCl2) dissolved in a glycerol&#8208;water solvent replenishes free Cl&#8722; to fully activate I0/I&#8314; conversion while enhancing high&#8208;voltage tolerance. This cooperative design delivers an organic&#8208;based two&#8208;electron ZIB with 87.0% capacity retention over 11,000 cycles, and validates its universality in a carbon&#8208;based ZIB retaining 87.2% capacity after 35,000 cycles. By uniting cathodic confinement with electrolyte liberation, dual&#8208;zone chloride engineering establishes a generalizable framework for stabilizing two&#8208;electron iodine redox chemistry, paving the way toward durable, high&#8208;energy aqueous ZIBs.

         <title>Synergistic Microstructure and Composition Engineering via Na2S Enables High&#8208;Performance Porous PbTe Thermoelectrics with Ultrahigh Device Power Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na2S&#8208;driven microstructure and composition co&#8208;design enables the simultaneous formation of hierarchical porosity and effective Na incorporation in PbTe&#8208;based thermoelectrics, promoting enhanced phonon scattering and optimized carrier transport properties. This integrated approach yields a record&#8208;high power density of 2.2&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#916;T&#160;=&#160;375&#160;K in thermoelectric modules, establishing a scalable route toward efficient and cost&#8208;effective mid&#8208;temperature energy conversion.








Abstract
Thermoelectric (TE) materials, capable of directly converting heat into electricity, offer a promising route for sustainable energy recovery. However, practical deployment is limited by the difficulty in simultaneously optimizing electrical and thermal transport properties. In this study, a synergistic microstructure&#8208;composition co&#8208;design strategy for enhancing the performance of PbTe&#8208;based TEs via Na2S&#8208;assisted solid&#8208;state synthesis is presented. The thermal decomposition of Na2S not only introduces hierarchical porosity but also facilitates initial Na doping, enabling the concurrent optimization of phonon scattering, carrier concentration, and band convergence. The optimized composition, Pb0.97Na0.03Te&#8208;1.0%Na2S, exhibits refined grains, dispersed Na2Te nanoprecipitates, and a high density of dislocations, leading to ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (&#8776;0.50&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1 at 750&#160;K) while preserving excellent electrical transport. A peak TE figure of merit zT&#8776;2.2 at 823&#160;K and a high average zT &#8776;1.9 across 623&#8211;823&#160;K are achieved. To validate the device&#8208;level applicability, single&#8208;leg TE modules are fabricated, achieving a high conversion efficiency of 13.4% at &#916;T&#160;= 395&#160;K, which is among the best reported for a PbTe&#8208;based system. Furthermore, a unicouple module integrated with n&#8208;type skutterudite reaches a record power density of 2.2&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#916;T&#160;=&#160;375&#160;K. This study highlights a scalable pathway for advancing mid&#8208;temperature TE materials and devices through structural and compositional engineering.

         <title>Enhancing Field Effects of Single&#8208;Atom Ru/Lignin Carbon Nanoreactors for Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution by Continuous Heterogeneous Curvature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To meet the challenges of scarce&#160;active sites and sluggish catalytic kinetics arising from nanocurvature and tip&#8208;effect. Single&#8208;atom Ru/lignin carbon nanoreactors are prepared by optimizing uniform&#8208;nanocurvature with tip effects for excellent electrocatalytic HER. The HeterC&#8208;LCS depicts a lowest overpotential of 9.2&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and Tafel slope of 8.7&#160;mV dec&#8722;1, which outperforms all known carbon&#8208; and Ru&#8208;based electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Local electric fields of the electrocatalysts can modulate adsorbate binding energies based on their polarizability and dipole moment, which directly influence the catalytic performance. Nevertheless, implementing the prevailing strategy remains challenging due to the scarcity of active sites and sluggish catalytic kinetics. Herein, a continuous heterogeneous&#8208;curvature nanoreactor (HeterC&#8208;LCS) is created to enhance local electric fields by optimizing the uniform&#8208;nanocurvature with tip effects. The H+ concentration and H2O transmission rate of HeterC&#8208;LCS are improved by about 2.1 and 1.7 times that of the homogeneous curvature structure (HomoC&#8208;LCS) during the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process. Besides, HeterC&#8208;LCS demonstrates a rapid kinetics of intermediate transformation and an extremely low energy barrier. Such HeterC&#8208;LCS depicts a lowest overpotential of 9.2&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, which outperforms all known carbon&#8208; and Ru&#8208;based electrocatalysts. And the mass activity is approximately 60 times that of commercial Pt/C. This work proposes a novel strategy of uniform&#8208;nanocurvature optimized by tip effects toward industrially electrocatalytic HER.

         <title>Personal Moisture Management by Advanced Textiles and Intelligent Wearables</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores advancements in personal moisture management (PMM) through advanced textiles and intelligent wearables, evolving from traditional methods like wicking and evaporation to cutting&#8208;edge innovations such as directional water transport, stimuli&#8208;responsive textiles, and AI&#8208;driven wearables. It also highlights PMM&#8208;enabled applications in health monitoring, energy harvesting, and thermoregulation, while addressing challenges in durability, scalability, and adaptability with intelligent, sustainable solutions.








Abstract
As global climate change intensifies, personal moisture management (PMM) is increasingly crucial for regulating body temperature and near&#8208;skin humidity, sustaining comfort, health, and productivity. Advances in textile materials and wearable technologies are moving PMM beyond traditional wicking&#8208;drying and waterproof&#8208;breathable designs toward directional sweat transport, stimuli&#8208;responsive control, and integration with personal thermal management (PTM). Advanced textiles and intelligent wearables enable more efficient, adaptive PMM; meanwhile, effective PMM enhances sensing performance and long&#8208;term comfort of wearable systems, and supports sweat&#8208;based health monitoring and energy harvesting, forming closed&#8208;loop, intelligent comfort&#8208;health&#8208;performance ecosystems. This review critically discusses PMM mechanisms and designs from capillary wicking and evaporation/diffusion to directional water transport and responsive moisture regulation, alongside manufacturing strategies spanning advanced fibers, nanoengineering, bioinspired architectures, smart polymers, and wearable electronics. PMM&#8208;enabled implementations in health monitoring and energy harvesting are introduced, and elucidate coupled moisture&#8208;heat transport to guide the co&#8208;optimization of PMM and PTM. Finally, key challenges are outlined, including sweat accumulation, reduced durability and washability, limited manufacturing scalability, and insufficient cross&#8209;scenario adaptability, and offer potential solutions, particularly AI&#8209;enabled pathways for intelligent, sustainable, next&#8209;generation PMM textiles and wearables.

It also highlights PMM-enabled applications in health monitoring, energy harvesting, and thermoregulation, while addressing challenges in durability, scalability, and adaptability with intelligent, sustainable solutions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As global climate change intensifies, personal moisture management (PMM) is increasingly crucial for regulating body temperature and near-skin humidity, sustaining comfort, health, and productivity. Advances in textile materials and wearable technologies are moving PMM beyond traditional wicking-drying and waterproof-breathable designs toward directional sweat transport, stimuli-responsive control, and integration with personal thermal management (PTM). Advanced textiles and intelligent wearables enable more efficient, adaptive PMM; meanwhile, effective PMM enhances sensing performance and long-term comfort of wearable systems, and supports sweat-based health monitoring and energy harvesting, forming closed-loop, intelligent comfort-health-performance ecosystems. This review critically discusses PMM mechanisms and designs from capillary wicking and evaporation/diffusion to directional water transport and responsive moisture regulation, alongside manufacturing strategies spanning advanced fibers, nanoengineering, bioinspired architectures, smart polymers, and wearable electronics. PMM-enabled implementations in health monitoring and energy harvesting are introduced, and elucidate coupled moisture-heat transport to guide the co-optimization of PMM and PTM. Finally, key challenges are outlined, including sweat accumulation, reduced durability and washability, limited manufacturing scalability, and insufficient cross&#8209;scenario adaptability, and offer potential solutions, particularly AI&#8209;enabled pathways for intelligent, sustainable, next&#8209;generation PMM textiles and wearables.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Leveraging Cross&#8208;Cutting Technologies to Unravel Light&#8208;Heat&#8208;Water Interactions at Solar Evaporation Interfaces: Propelling the Low&#8208;Carbon Water&#8208;Energy Nexus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explains how advanced numerical simulation techniques can be utilized to analyze the light&#8208;heat&#8208;water interactions in solar evaporation systems. It objectively explores the underlying mechanisms and energy transfer processes behind clean water production. The study points out possible sources of errors and limitations in large&#8208;scale applications and provides a perspective on the future of low&#8208;carbon water&#8208;energy technologies.








Abstract
Multifunctional solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation (SDIE) systems have emerged as a critical technology for clean water production. Advances in evaporator design and component optimization have significantly enhanced their performance, enabling highly efficient operation in small&#8208;scale applications such as seawater desalination and steam sterilization, even under extreme environmental conditions. Nevertheless, critical mechanisms remain insufficiently resolved: light&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion dynamics and interfacial interactions during evaporation, synergistic thermal confinement and management strategies, and water transport/activation mechanisms at solid&#8208;liquid&#8208;gas interfaces mediated by suspended materials. This review systematically examines unsystematized photothermal&#8208;water conversion processes and cross&#8208;disciplinary application scenarios through analysis of archetypal evaporator configurations. By adopting an integrated multi&#8208;scale analysis framework and leveraging advanced computational modeling techniques, the metrological significance of performance metrics, inherent measurement uncertainties, and fundamental value&#8208;translation mechanisms in specialized implementations is elucidated. Concurrently, intrinsic limitations hindering large&#8208;scale deployment are identified, providing critical insights into scalability challenges across diverse operational contexts. This approach establishes a comprehensive theoretical foundation for optimizing next&#8208;generation SDIE systems while providing data references for cross&#8208;disciplinary advancement in the sustainable application of thermophotovoltaic evaporation.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Protonated Porphyrin Dimer Nanoparticles with an 83.7% Near&#8208;Infrared Photothermal Conversion Efficiency for Antitumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonation&#8208;manipulation molecular self&#8208;assembly of TAPP leads to the formation of protonated dimer that facilitate the transition from a saddle&#8208;shaped conformation to a quinone&#8208;like resonance structure. These structures enhance intermolecular exciton coupling, significantly improving NIR absorption and efficiently converting light into heat for TAPP NIR&#8208;NPs. This process achieves an impressive PCE of up to 83.7%, surpassing that of traditional porphyrin&#8208;derived PTAs.








Abstract
Despite the immense potential of near&#8208;infrared photothermal therapy (NIR PTT) for tumor treatment, the development of photothermal agents (PTAs) with high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) remains a substantial challenge. Here, a &#8220;protonation&#8208;manipulation molecular self&#8208;assembly&#8221; strategy is presented that precisely regulates the protonation of the pyrrole nitrogen in 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;aminophenyl)porphyrin (TAPP), while maintaining the availability of the lone pair electrons on the nitrogen atoms in the aniline substituents. The resulting protonated dimers facilitate the formation of a robust saddle&#8208;shaped conformation and a quinone&#8208;like resonance structure, which subsequently self&#8208;assemble into near&#8208;infrared nanoparticles (NIR NPs). These protonated dimers enhance intermolecular exciton coupling, significantly improving absorption in the near&#8208;infrared region. The photoexcitation process of TAPP NIR NPs is primarily governed by non&#8208;radiative transitions, achieving an impressive PCE of up to 83.7%, markedly surpassing that of organic PTAs such as dopamine and traditional porphyrin derivatives. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that NIR NPs effectively eliminate tumor cells while exhibiting excellent biocompatibility. This work represents a significant advancement in performance optimization from the spectral regulation of supramolecular photosensitizers, introducing innovative methodologies for the design of aromatic nitrogen&#8208;containing PTAs functional molecules.

         <title>Synergy of Block and Microporous Polymers with Tailored Zeolitic Imidazole Frameworks for Membrane&#8208;Based Direct Air Capture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thin film composite membranes&#8208;based on PolyActive and polymer of intrinsic microporosity&#160;(PIM&#8208;1) are prepared and modified with zeolitic imidazole frameworks&#160;(ZIF) obtained by two&#8208;step solvent&#8208;assisted ligand exchange. Their direct air capture (DAC) performance is evaluated from 500&#160;ppm to 15% CO2. A multistage DAC study highlights polymer&#160;pairing andmodified ZIFs enhancing low&#8208;concentration CO2 capture.








Abstract
Direct air capture (DAC) concerns the separation from air of carbon dioxide (CO2), the most significant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, as a means of producing negative emissions. The challenge for the scientific and industrial communities is tremendous, and membrane technology is postulated as an efficient alternative in terms of energy, costs, and ease of implementation. Two polymers, commercial elastomeric PolyActive and high&#8208;performance polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM&#8208;1), with complementary permeation&#8208;selectivity features, to form both dense and thin film composite membranes, are studied to operate in the 500&#160;ppm to 15% range of CO2 feed concentration and at 10&#8211;50 &#176;C temperatures. A study on its synergistic pairing for a multistage DAC process is evaluated and to enhance the separation performance, the membranes are modified with zeolitic imizadolate frameworks (ZIF), capable of modification by solvent&#8208;assisted ligand exchange (SALE). A sequential SALE process is designed using two different ligands, one hydrophilic and the other hydrophobic, to modify nanosized ZIF&#8208;8 and produce a ZIF with tailored ligand composition. This is aimed at improving both the CO2 interaction and compatibility of MOF with the membrane polymer, achieving at 500&#160;ppm a CO2 permeance of 1037 GPU with a CO2/N2 selectivity of 16.2.

         <title>Multifunctional Dithiol Crosslinking Additive Enables Highly Efficient and Stable Inkjet&#8208;Printed Perovskite Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional additive, 1,4&#8208;bis(3&#8208;mercaptobutyryloxy)butane (BD1), significantly enhances inkjet&#8208;printed perovskite quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes by simultaneously optimizing ink rheology, enabling defect passivation through dithiol and carbonyl interactions, and promoting cross&#8208;linking via thiol groups. These synergistic effects lead to the formation of robust and stable quantum dot film networks, resulting in a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 21.73%, highlighting BD1&#8217;s potential for high&#8208;performance quantum dot display applications.








Abstract
Inkjet printing provides a scalable, cost&#8208;effective approach for fabricating perovskite quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (Pe&#8208;QLEDs), particularly suited for high&#8208;resolution display applications. However, challenges such as poor ink printability and limited stability of perovskite quantum dots (Pe&#8208;QD) inks have impeded its widespread adoption. To overcome these limitations, 1,4&#8208;bis(3&#8208;mercaptobutyryloxy)butane (BD1), a dithiol&#8208;based cross&#8208;linkable additive is introduced to enable high&#8208;performance inkjet&#8208;printed Pe&#8208;QLEDs. BD1 serves three critical functions: i) it optimizes the rheological properties of the ink, promoting uniform droplet formation and adaptable inkjet printing process; ii) its thiol groups coordinate with under&#8208;coordinated Pb2&#8314; sites on the QD surface, mitigating ligand loss during ink formulation and deposition, thus reducing defect density and enhancing optical quality; and iii) it participates in a thiol&#8208;ene click reaction with oleic acid ligands, forming robust crosslinked networks that improve film integrity and device stability. By leveraging these synergistic effects, BD1&#8208;enabled Pe&#8208;QLEDs achieve a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 21.73%, a peak luminance of 30,637.82 cd&#160;m&#8722;2, and an enhanced operational lifetime. This additive engineering strategy also demonstrates versatility across red and blue Pe&#8208;QLEDs, highlighting its broad applicability. Collectively, the findings position BD1 as a highly effective multifunctional additive for stabilizing and optimizing Pe&#8208;QD inks, paving the way for scalable production of high&#8208;resolution, full&#8208;color Pe&#8208;QLED displays and other printed optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Interfacial Synergistic Hydrogen Spillover and Electron Transfer for Boosting Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR)&#160;can use renewable energy to produce green ammonia, while solving the problem of wastewater treatment. However, the simultaneous optimization of proton and electron transfer on copper&#8208;based catalysts is still challenging, leading to poor selectivity. In this work, interfacial synergism of hydrogen spillover and electron transfer of CoNi&#8211;LDH@Cu2O is adopted to for boosting NO3&#8722;RR, achieving remarkable performance.








Abstract
Nitrate overabundance in wastewater brings environmental pollution and health risks, while the traditional Haber&#8722;Bosch process for ammonia production is accompanied by huge energy consumption and carbon emissions. Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) can use renewable energy to produce green ammonia and provide a sustainable route for wastewater treatment. Electrochemical NO3&#8722;RR process involves multiple proton&#8208;coupled&#8208;electron steps; however, simultaneous optimization of proton and electron transfer is still challenging, leading to poor selectivity for ammonia production. Here, the interfacial synergism of hydrogen spillover and electron transfer is demonstrated to boost electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia. Experimental and theoretical calculation results show that the interface hydrogen spillover of CoNi&#8211;layered double hydroxide (LDH) accelerates the hydrogenation step of NO3&#8722;RR, while the electron transfer to Cu2O promotes the reduction of adsorbed NO3&#8722;. Benefitting from the interfacial synergistic hydrogen spillover and electron transfer, the CoNi&#8211;LDH@Cu2O catalyst achieves a remarkable Faradaic efficiency of 97.8% at &#8722;0.3&#160;V versus RHE, and a high NH3 yield rate of 75.2&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at an industrial&#8208;relevant current density &#8776;1 A cm&#8722;2. This work provides insights into the interface design strategy to enhance NO3&#8722;RR performance for waste nitrate treatment and green ammonia synthesis.

         <title>Bridging Laboratory Catalysts with Industrial Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective critically examines the key challenges impeding the transition of laboratory&#8208;synthesized catalysts to industrial&#8208;scale PEMWE for sustainable hydrogen generation. A systematic roadmap is proposed to address the gap between electrocatalyst development and industrial implementation, emphasizing the design of high&#8208;performance, cost&#8208;effective, and stable catalysts tailored for practical industrial applications.








Abstract
The development of highly active catalysts has significantly advanced water electrolysis for green hydrogen production. However, translating these materials from laboratory&#8208;scale demonstrations to industrial proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) remains a major challenge. In this perspective, key gaps are identified between academic electrocatalyst research for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media and the stringent requirements of industrial PEMWEs. The scalability and industrial relevance of current catalyst synthesis and electrode fabrication techniques are critically analyzed, proposing scalable routes such as plasma&#8208;enhanced atomic layer deposition, roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll processing, and electrodeposition. The discrepancies in testing protocols between three&#8208;electrode aqueous cells, membrane electrode assemblies and full electrolysis stacks are further discussed highlighting the challenges of making direct performance comparisons. To bridge this gap, relevant activity descriptors that connect catalyst properties with device&#8208;level performance under industrial conditions are introduced, and critically highlight the importance of conducting both operando characterization and techno&#8208;economic analysis. Finally, strategies to enhance both catalytic activity and durability, including electronic metal&#8208;support interactions, porosity engineering, and single&#8208;atom catalyst design, are highlighted. By integrating synthesis, testing, and mechanistic insights, this perspective offers a comprehensive roadmap to rationally design and implement next&#8208;generation catalysts tailored for scalable, durable, and efficient industrial green hydrogen production.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Pa&#8208;Level Persistent Mechanoluminescent Material Toward All&#8208;Optical Neural Synapses for Tactile&#8208;Visual Information Recognition and Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study presents an ultrasensitive Pa&#8208;Level persistent mechanoluminescent material via Li+/Dy3+ co&#8208;doping&#8208;mediated defect engineering of a Sr2SiO4:Eu2+, achieving dual breakthroughs in sensitivity and signal clarity enabled by synergistic oxygen vacancy optimization and strontium vacancy suppression. Simultaneously, it enables multi&#8208;stimuli response to solar light, mechanical force, and thermal input, replicating diverse synaptic functionalities such as tactile nerve perception, optic nerve imaging, short&#8208;term potentiation, and information memory.








Abstract
Mechanoluminescence (ML), a self&#8208;recovering and passive luminescent modality, offers a promising path toward tactile&#8208;visual all&#8208;optical neuromorphic computing, potentially overcoming the inefficiency of von Neumann architecture. However, existing ML materials are hindered by high response thresholds and single&#8208;mode luminescence, preventing sub&#8208;kPa perception and multilevel neural transmission. Here, we employ Li+/Dy3+ co&#8208;doping in Sr2SiO4:Eu2+ (LSSO) to implement a defect engineering strategy that synergistically optimizes oxygen vacancies and suppresses strontium vacancies, achieving dual breakthroughs in sensitivity and signal clarity. This approach yields a record&#8208;low ML threshold of 72 Pa&#8212;the only Pa&#8208;level system achieved without external electricity or elastomeric structural modifications. This material also responds to sunlight, force, and heat, emulating diverse synaptic functions like tactile/optic nerve perception, short&#8208;term potentiation, and memory. It exhibits a 7&#8208;s persistent ML with a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio of 20.57 which is 15.6 times higher than commercial SrAl2O4:Eu2+,Dy3+, a micron&#8208;scale imaging resolution (&#8776;200 &#181;m), and a 36&#8208;hour memory capacity. These properties enable thermal&#8208;activated information awakening and visual imaging over 1000 cycles, with a memory accuracy 209% superior to the Ebbinghaus curve. This work not only advances the design of all&#8208;optical synapses but also forges a pivotal connection between ML and neuromorphic engineering, propelling energy&#8208;efficient, light&#8208;driven artificial intelligence.

         <title>Acidity&#8208;Mediated Metal Oxide Heterointerfaces: Roles of Substrates and Surface Modification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of local space charge, not only at heterointerfaces, but also at grain boundaries, influenced by surface acidity modulation is elucidated through model platforms composed of Pr&#8208;doped ceria (mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conducting oxide) nanowire arrays. The large potential impact of surface acidity on the electronic properties of nanostructured functional oxides is illustrated.








Abstract
Although strong modulation of interfacial electron concentrations by the relative acidity of surface additives is suggested, direct observation of corresponding changes in surface conductivity, crucial for understanding the role of local space charge, is lacking. Here, a model platform comprising well&#8208;aligned mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conducting Pr0.2Ce0.8O2&#8208;&#948; nanowire arrays (PCONA) is introduced to show that acidity&#8208;modulated heterointerfaces predict electron depletion or accumulation, resulting in tunable electrical properties. Three orders of magnitude increased PCONA conductivity are confirmed with basic Li2O infiltration. Moreover, the relative acidity of the insulating substrate supporting the PCONA strongly influences its electronic properties as well. This strategy is further validated in purely ionic&#8208;conducting nanostructured ceria as well as PCONA. It is suggested that observed conductivity changes stem not only from acidity&#8208;mediated space charge potentials at heterointerfaces but also from grain boundaries, chemically&#8208;modulated by cation in&#8208;diffusion. These findings have broad implications for how substrate and surface treatment choices can alter the conductive properties of nanostructured functional oxides.

A thermal and moisture regulating textile (TMRT) integrated with exceptional sustained cooling and moisture&#8211;regulating properties is developed via coaxial electrospinning. The TMRT features a rationally designed core&#8211;shell micro/nanofiber structure, comprising a moisture&#8211;regulating polymer sheath and thermal&#8211;responsive polymer core, which addresses critical limitations in mitigating thermal and humidity accumulation during prolonged wear.








Abstract
Thermal and moisture balance in the body&#8211;textile microclimate is critical for human comfort, health management, and prolonged wearability. However, designing a textile system capable of simultaneously achieving sustained cooling and dynamic moisture regulation remains an unaddressed and significant challenge. Herein, a thermal and moisture regulating textile (TMRT) is developed via coaxial electrospinning, featuring a rationally designed core&#8211;shell micro/nanofiber structure with a moisture&#8211;regulating polymer sheath and a thermal&#8211;responsive polymer core. The resulting TMRT exhibits exceptional mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) emissivity (99.82%) and low solar reflectivity (7.71%), an outstanding contact cooling coefficient (0.43 W cm&#8722;2), and ultralow thermal resistance (0.08 m2 K W&#8722;1), enabling &#8776; 6.6 &#176;C reduction in skin temperature at 40 &#176;C. Remarkably, the TMRT demonstrates low moisture resistance (2.49 m2 K W&#8722;1) and a high water evaporation rate (0.59 g h&#8722;1). Furthermore, it possesses favorable moisture regulation performance and rapid humidity response, achieving a humidity&#8211;sensing resolution of 0.5% relative humidity (RH). The TMRT&#8211;based protective clothing displays a comfortable microenvironment for the human body. This work establishes a groundbreaking paradigm for advanced textiles with synergistic thermal and moisture management, addressing critical limitations in conventional protective gear, particularly in mitigating heat and humidity accumulation during prolonged use.

         <title>Peptide Amphiphiles Hitchhike on Endogenous Biomolecules for Enhanced Cancer Imaging and Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Weakly assembled peptide amphiphile nanostructures disassemble in circulation and reassemble with blood biomolecules, mainly lipoproteins. Binding to blood biomolecules prolongs blood circulation and improves accumulation in solid tumors. In the tumor microenvironment, peptide amphiphiles assemble with cholesterol&#8208;rich domains of cell membranes, allowing them to selectively internalize in cancer cells and effectively deliver chemotherapies conjugated to them.








Abstract
The interactions of nanomaterials with biomolecules in vivo determine their biological fate. Here, it is shown that self&#8208;assembled peptide amphiphile (PA) nanostructures can dynamically interact with endogenous biomolecules and take advantage of naturally occurring processes to target a broad range of solid tumors. In circulation, self&#8208;assembled PA nanostructures disassemble and reassemble mainly with lipoproteins, which prolongs blood circulation and dramatically improves tumor accumulation and retention. Mechanistic studies suggested that PAs internalize into cancer cells by assembling with their cell membranes and independently of specific receptors. By exploiting these interactions, a PA developed in this study (namely Self&#8208;Assembly &#8208; Glutamic acid, SA&#8208;E) demonstrates specific accumulation in various xenograft, syngeneic, patient&#8208;derived xenograft, or transgenic rodent models. In addition, SA&#8208;E enabled the effective delivery of highly potent chemotherapy to different syngeneic and xenografted tumors with reduced side effects. With its simple and modular design and universal tumor accumulation mechanism, SA&#8208;E represents a promising platform for broad applications in cancer imaging and therapy.

         <title>Chimeric Glycoprotein Nanoparticles Elicit Robust Neutralizing Antibodies Against Epstein&#8211;Barr Virus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epstein&#8211;Barr virus (EBV) lacks vaccines/therapeutics despite causing cancers. Chimeric nanoparticles co&#8208;displaying EBV's gB/gHgL fusion apparatus are designed. These induce stronger neutralizing antibodies than cocktails in animals, mimicking whole&#8208;virion antibody patterns. Single&#8208;BCR sequencing reveals a novel gB&#8208;targeting neutralizing antibody (Fab5) to a new site. This strategy offers potent EBV vaccine candidates and insights for multi&#8208;antigen pathogens.








Abstract
Epstein&#8210;Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous gammaherpesvirus linked to a broad spectrum of malignancies and autoimmune diseases with no approved therapeutic drugs or vaccines. EBV infection relies on the viral glycoproteins gB and gHgL, which, together, function as the fusion apparatus, mediating viral recognition and membrane fusion in both epithelial and B cells. Despite discovering potent neutralizing antibodies targeting gB and gHgL, the heterogeneous antigen structures and distribution of multiple glycoproteins in the virion hinder rational vaccine design targeting this apparatus complex. In this study, Chimeric nanoparticles (Chimeric&#8208;NPs) are designed that co&#8208;display EBV fusion apparatus and induce significantly more neutralizing antibodies in mice and nonhuman primates than the cocktail counterparts. It is further demonstrated that the Chimeric&#8208;NPs elicited neutralizing antibodies predominantly targeting gB, closely mimicking the antibody induction pattern by the whole EBV virion. Additionally, single&#8208;BCR sequencing is used to analyze the B cell response to Chimeric&#8208;NP, and a novel gB neutralizing antibody Fab5 targeting a new vulnerable site EBV gB is identified. These findings provide novel candidates and vaccine design strategies for EBV and reveal the underlying mechanisms of antibody induction and immune response regulation by chimera vaccines, with potential implications for all multi&#8208;antigen&#8208;harbored pathogens.

         <title>Revealing How Acid Sites Enhance the Electrocatalytic Glycerol Oxidation Performance on Pt Loaded Zeolite&#8208;Carbon Composite Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the work reported herein, the catalytic effects of acid sites on electrocatalytic glycerol oxidation reaction are investigated by using a novel catalytic material system that integrates Pt metal sites with acidic Al sites.








Abstract
The catalytic role and function of acid sites in solid acid catalysts, such as zeolites, are well understood in the context of heterogeneous catalytic reactions. But although many studies have highlighted the importance of acid sites, their catalytic effects in electrocatalytic reactions have rarely been investigated. In this work, a novel catalyst synthesis strategy is developed, integrating metal sites with acid sites for application in the electrocatalytic glycerol oxidation reaction (EGOR). Specifically, an ordered microporous carbon support containing acidic aluminum sites (AlYTC) is prepared through a nanocasting approach using a sacrificial zeolite template. Platinum (Pt) nanoclusters are then deposited onto the AlYTC support, forming a structure that exposes both acid sites and Pt nanoclusters on a zeolite&#8208;templated 3D carbon framework (PtAlYTC). The prepared PtAlYTC catalyst demonstrates a turnover frequency (TOF, s&#8722;1) 30 times higher and a reaction rate (&#956;molgpt&#8722;1s&#8722;1$\mu mol\;g_{pt}^{ - 1}{s^{ - 1}}$) 17 times greater than those of a Pt catalyst lacking acid sites (PtYTC) in the EGOR. First&#8208;principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the combination of Pt sites and acidic Al sites lowers the Gibbs free energy of key reaction steps, improves charge transfer, and strengthens hydrogen adsorption, thereby significantly enhancing the catalytic performance in EGOR.

         <title>NIR&#8208;Driven Nanomotors Integrating With Platelet&#8208;Thylakoid Hybrid Membranes for Synchronized Thrombolysis and Vascular Remodeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NIR&#8208;responsive nanomotors PSr@PT NPs, which integrate thylakoid and platelet membranes on strontium&#8208;doped mesoporous polydopamine nanoparticles, can transform transient thrombus removal into self&#8208;sustained vascular repair through biology&#8208;inspired actuation mechanisms.








Abstract
The pathological interplay of oxidative stress, inflammation, and thrombosis driven by endothelial injury creates a self&#8208;perpetuating cycle that undermines conventional thrombolytic therapies. Herein, near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;responsive nanomotors are constructed by integrating thylakoid and platelet membranes on strontium&#8208;doped mesoporous polydopamine nanoparticles (PSr@PT NPs), which enables synchronized thrombus dissolution and vascular microenvironment restoration. Following intravenous administration, PSr@PT nanomotors exhibited preferential accumulation within thrombi and were internalized by injured endothelial cells. Meanwhile, thylakoid&#8208;embedded catalase catalyzed endogenous hydrogen peroxide to oxygen, which can not only suppress oxidative damage and neutralize to disrupt platelet&#8208;endothelium interactions, but also generate self&#8208;propulsive forces via gas propulsion, facilitating deep intrathrombus penetration of PSr@PT NPs. Proteomic analysis revealed that PSr@PT NPs inhibited thrombosis progression by downregulating platelet activation and modulating JAK&#8208;STAT/PI3K&#8208;Akt signaling pathways, thereby reducing inflammation and fostering angiogenesis. Local NIR irradiation induced mild photothermal conversion of PSr@PT NPs, which softened fibrin networks, enhanced intrathrombus infiltration, and accelerated localized thrombolysis. In both FeCl3&#8208;induced murine carotid thrombosis and arachidonic acid&#8208;induced zebrafish thrombosis models, the PSr@PT NPs effectively resolved occlusions and restored endothelial function. By coupling ROS&#8208;powered propulsion with adaptive microenvironment remodeling, this nanomotor transcends conventional 1D clot lysis, offering a dynamic strategy to prevent thrombosis recurrence and accelerate functional vascular recovery.

         <title>Bisphosphonate&#8208;Embedded a &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Passivator Enable Efficient and Stable n&#8208;i&#8208;p Perovskite Solar Cells with Low&#8208;Polarity Solvent Processing</title>

         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;polarity solvent&#8208;soluble bisphosphate molecule, named DCTP, is introduced into n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs as a surface passivator. The DCTP&#8208;controlled device achieves a champion PCE of 26.07% with excellent reproducibility. Moreover, the DCTP&#8208;controlled device retains 90.1% of its initial PCE after 900 h of maximum power point tracking with 1&#8208;sun illumination at 65&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Interface passivators play a critical role in improving the efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the conventional passivators often require processing in high&#8208;polarity solvents that can cause additional surface defects on the perovskite film, thereby reducing the efficiency and stability of n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs. Herein, a bisphosphate molecule (named DCTP) is designed and synthesized to simultaneously address solvent compatibility, defect passivation, and hole extraction. DCTP has good solubility in low&#8208;polarity solvents such as toluene, chlorobenzene, and chloroform without damaging the perovskite surface. The chlorobenzene&#8208;processed DCTP interlayer can sufficiently passivate the defects on the perovskite surface and improve the energy level arrangement at the perovskite/hole transporting layer interface. Meanwhile, the DCTP layer effectively inhibits interlayer diffusion of formamidine (FA+), iodide (I&#8722;), and lithium (Li+) and ions under thermal stress. As a result, the DCTP&#8208;controlled device produces a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.07% with excellent reproducibility, compared to 24.28% for the reference device. More importantly, the operational stability of the device is significantly improved. The DCTP&#8208;treated device retains 90.1% of its initial PCE after 900 h of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) at 65&#160;&#176;C under the ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2I protocol.

         <title>Backbone Tailoring Enables High&#8208;Performance and Stable n&#8208;Type Organic Mixed Ionic&#8208;Electronic Conductors for Synaptic Simulation and Biosensor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By meticulously tailoring the molecular lengths of bithiophene imide derivatives with tunable imide group numbers, it is found that the medium&#8208;sized fused bithiophene imide dimer&#8208;based PBTI2g&#8208;DTCN demonstrates significantly improved film structural order and enhanced ion/electron transport properties, thus leading to high&#8208;performance and stable n&#8208;type organic electrochemical transistors, which have been successfully applied in synaptic simulations and biosensing.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance and stable n&#8208;type organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs) are crucial for advancing organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs)&#8208;based low&#8208;power complementary circuits and biosensors, yet their development remains a great challenge. Herein, the study presents a series of donor&#8208;acceptor polymers incorporating bithiophene (BTI) and fused BTI derivatives with varying conjugation backbone lengths as acceptors. The mid&#8208;size fused BTI dimer enables polymer PBTI2g&#8208;DTCN with simultaneously improved ion&#8208;uptake capability, film structural order, and ion/electron transport capability. Consequently, an impressive electron mobility of 0.84 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and a record figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit (&#181;C*) of 287.8 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 are achieved for PBTI2g&#8208;DTCN&#8208;based n&#8208;type conventional OECT in accumulation mode, while the vertical OECTs (vOECTs) attain a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art area&#8208;normalized transconductance (gm,A) of 71.8 &#181;S &#181;m&#8722;2 with remarkable operational stability. Through finely manipulating the channel components, the vOECTs demonstrate dual&#8208;mode operation, switching between non&#8208;volatile and volatile states. In non&#8208;volatile mode, vOECT&#8208;based artificial synapses with excellent ambient stability enable dynamic learning and are employed in convolutional neural networks for image recognition. In volatile mode, they excel in biosensing, monitoring electrocardiography and electromyography signals. These remarkable results demonstrate that backbone tailoring is a powerful strategy for developing high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type OMIECs for synaptic and sensor applications.

         <title>Rhus Chinensis &#8208; Inspired Vertical Hierarchical Structure for Solar &#8208; Driven All &#8208; Weather Co &#8208; Harvesting of Fresh Water, Clean Salts, and Authigenic Electricity</title>

         <dc:description>
The unsatisfactory outdoor performance and potential contamination of recovered products limit the wider practical deployment of interfacial solar evaporators. In response, we develop a Rhus chinensis &#8208; inspired vertical hierarchical structure (RVHS) to achieve all &#8208; weather extraction of fresh water, clean salt, and authigenic electricity.








Abstract
The escalating challenges in water, energy, and environmental sustainability necessitate the efficient utilization of diverse water sources, such as seawater and wastewater. Herein, a Rhus chinensis &#8208;inspired vertical hierarchical structure (RVHS) is developed to achieve all &#8208; weather extraction of fresh water, clean salt, and authigenic electricity. The RVHS achieves high water production rates of 5.07&#160;kg m&#8722;2 during the day and 2.04&#160;kg m&#8722;2 at night, approximately 1.2 times and 1.8 times those of conventional ones, respectively, by strategically&#160;manipulating phase change material (PCM) and heat storage. Simultaneously, it enables an enhanced salt recovery of 2.24&#160;kg m&#8722;2, yielding purified salt free from detectable contaminants (such as microplastics and persistent organic pollutants), facilitated by a pollutant capture trap integrated into the RVHS, a feature rarely explored in prior research. Furthermore, during salt recovery, the optimized salt concentration gradient can be further utilized for energy harvesting with high power output through thermodynamic optimization, which is approximately 60% greater than traditional devices. Further performance improvements can be realized by optimizing thermodynamic structures or integrating higher &#8208; performance materials. In conclusion, this work offers a universal routine for solar &#8208; driven resource recovery from seawater.

         <title>Independent Wavefront Multiplexing with Metasurfaces via Non&#8208;Injective Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a universal metasurface multiplexing strategy is presented based on non&#8208;injective transformation. By jointly optimizing two metasurfaces, multiplexed channels achieve independent wavefront control, overcoming crosstalk limits of single&#8208;layer designs. Experiments demonstrate ultra&#8208;compact orbital angular momentum (OAM) sorters and 10&#8208;channel holography without post&#8208;processing. This approach enables scalable, precise, and high&#8208;capacity wavefront manipulation for advanced photonic applications.








Abstract
Metasurface holography offers a powerful approach for manipulating wavefronts at the nano and micro scale. Extensive research has been conducted to enhance the multiplexing capacity for diverse wavefronts. However, the independence of multiplexed channels is fundamentally restricted in techniques using single&#8208;layer metasurfaces, resulting in unavoidable crosstalk and the need for post&#8208;filtering of the output wavefronts. Here, a universal wavefront multiplexing concept is presented based on non&#8208;injective transformation. By employing joint optimization on two metasurfaces, different channels can be independently designed without any constraints on the output wavefronts. To validate this approach, ultra&#8208;compact orbital angular momentum (OAM) sorters are designed. In these experiments, the output beams from different channels can be independently mapped to 2D positions with high fineness. In another application of wavefront&#8208;multiplexed holography, 10&#8208;channel multiplexing is experimentally achieved with minimal crosstalk and without the need for post&#8208;processing. These results demonstrate the independence between channels enabled by the non&#8208;injective transformation in the method. The precise wavefront control and high multiplexing capacity underscore its potential for scalable wavefront manipulation devices.

         <title>Horn&#8208;Inspired Hierarchical Tubular Composites for Recoverable High&#8208;Energy Absorption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A horn&#8208;inspired composite is fabricated by integrating a concentric lamellar&#8208;aligned scaffold with a dynamic covalent epoxy matrix. This material achieves high recoverable energy absorption (10 MJ&#183;m&#8722;3), compressive strength (&gt;50 MPa), and cyclic mechanical recovery. This scalable biomimetic strategy provides a pathway toward lightweight, reusable protective systems with exceptional energy dissipation.








Abstract
Recoverable energy&#8208;absorbing materials are crucial for advancing impact&#8208;resistant systems; however, they are typically limited by low energy dissipation (&lt;1 MJ&#183;m&#8722;3). The horn of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) exhibits outstanding energy dissipation and shape recovery, enabled by multiscale mechanisms including aligned tubules and lamellar keratin cells, along with hydration&#8208;driven self&#8208;recovery. Inspired by this hierarchical architecture, a recoverable porous energy&#8208;absorbing composite through a modified gelation&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly method is fabricated to construct a microtubular scaffold with lamellar&#8208;aligned nanoplatelets, which is subsequently infiltrated with a dynamic covalent epoxy matrix. The optimized composite exhibits exceptional energy absorption (10 MJ&#183;m&#8722;3), exceeding conventional recoverable architected materials by an order of magnitude, while simultaneously achieving high compressive strength (&gt; 50 MPa), low density (1.1 g&#183;cm&#8722;3), and stable cyclic shape recovery performance. These mechanical properties arise from synergistic multiscale toughening mechanisms, including tubular buckling (macroscale), lamellar crack deflection and interfacial delamination (microscale), and matrix viscoelasticity (nanoscale). The epoxy matrix further contributes to reversible deformation and cyclic damage recovery. This study establishes a scalable biomimetic strategy for engineering lightweight, high&#8208;strength, and reusable materials with high energy dissipation, addressing critical challenges in potential protective applications.

         <title>Materials Design and Assessment of Redox&#8208;Mediated Flow Cell Systems for Enhanced Energy Storage and Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;mediated flow cells, which operate on an electrochemical&#8208;chemical cycle, shift desired reactions from electrode compartments to dedicated reactors and enable diversified applications for high&#8208;density flow batteries, fuel cells, CO2 capture, electrosynthesis, waste recycling, etc. This perspective outlines the material selection criteria, evaluation methods, and targeted design strategies toward next&#8208;generation applications.








Abstract
The transition toward sustainable energy systems necessitates innovations that overcome the limitations of conventional electrochemical systems. Redox&#8208;mediated flow cell systems emerge as a transformative paradigm by decoupling energy storage, conversion, and chemical processes from traditional electrode&#8208;bound reactions. These systems employ soluble redox mediators to shuttle electrons between electrodes and spatially separated reactive phases (solid, liquid, or gas), thereby enabling unprecedented operational flexibility and scalability. This standpoint underscores the adaptability of redox&#8208;mediated electrified systems across a range of applications, encompassing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density redox targeting&#8208;based flow batteries, fuel cells, electrified CO2 capture, sustainable chemical synthesis, waste recycling, etc. The rational design of redox&#8208;active materials is central to their success, with precise alignment of redox potentials, enhanced electron&#8208;transfer kinetics, and robust stability underpinning performance. The challenges of new materials development, system durability, and cost&#8208;effectiveness can be addressed through advances in experimental measurement, computational modeling, operando characterization, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Moving forward, the integration of redox&#8208;mediated technologies with renewable energy systems and industrial processes is predicted to transform energy and chemical landscapes. The integration of laboratory innovations with real&#8208;world deployment facilitates a pathway to decarbonization, resource efficiency, and the circular economy. This perspective emphasizes the pivotal functions of redox&#8208;mediated architectures in fostering a robust, electrified future, where the convergence of energy storage, environmental stewardship, and sustainable chemical production is pivotal in addressing global challenges.

         <title>Environmental Response Temporal Release Injectable Hydrogel for Controlled Growth Factor Release to Enhance Inflammatory Periodontal Bone Defect Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops an injectable, multifunctional hydrogel integrating antioxidative, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and osteogenic properties. Responsive degradation enables staged release of concentrated growth factors (CGF) and low&#8208;dose bone morphogenetic protein&#8208;2 (BMP&#8208;2), efficiently regenerating periodontal bone defects. The system reduces BMP&#8208;2 dosage while maintaining efficacy, offering a precise strategy for inflammation&#8208;associated tissue repair.








Abstract
Regeneration of periodontal bone defects in an inflammatory microenvironment remains challenging due to oxidative stress and excessive bone resorption. Although various biomaterials have been developed, current strategies often fail to address the combined obstacles of immune dysregulation, oxidative damage, and bone loss. An injectable multifunctional hydrogel (HTF@HA) with a dynamic borate ester cross&#8208;linked network is designed to provide environmental responsiveness and temporal release of bioactive factors. Under acidic and oxidative conditions, the hydrogel degrades more rapidly and preferentially releases antioxidative and anti&#8208;inflammatory components, facilitating macrophage polarization toward the M2 phenotype and alleviating inflammation. During the subsequent repair phase, calcium&#8208;phosphate interactions mediate the sustained release of concentrated growth factors (CGF) and low&#8208;dose bone morphogenetic protein&#8208;2 (BMP&#8208;2), supporting osteogenic differentiation and angiogenesis. In vitro, HTF@HA exhibits high biocompatibility, antioxidative capacity, anti&#8208;inflammatory effects, and significant enhancement of periodontal ligament stem cell osteogenesis and endothelial cell angiogenesis under inflammatory conditions. Animal studies confirm that the hydrogel promoted new bone and vessel formation (p &lt; 0.001), and at a BMP&#8208;2 dose of 50&#160;&#181;g/L, it achieved bone regeneration comparable to high&#8208;dose BMP&#8208;2 (500&#160;&#181;g/L, p &gt; 0.05). Overall, HTF@HA provides a promising injectable biomaterial with &#8220;anti&#8208;inflammatory&#8208;antioxidant&#8208;regenerative&#8221; synergy for treating inflammation&#8208;associated periodontal bone defects.

         <title>Embedded Ir&#9472;Ru Single&#8208;Atom Alloy with Self&#8208;Limiting Motifs for Sustainable Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lattice&#8208;embedded SAA catalyst, featuring strong metal&#8208;support interactions, facilitates rapid directional electron transfer and dramatically enhances anode corrosion resistance, and the unique Ru&#8211;O&#8211;Ir motifs preserves inner metallic characteristics, providing a stable surface chemistry for sustainable proton exchange membrane water electrolysis.








Abstract
Designing acid&#8208;stable anodic electrocatalysts with low noble&#8208;metal loading is essential for the industrial&#8208;scale application of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). However, existing catalyst systems struggle to fully utilize the intrinsic properties of active sites. Here, a precisely engineered nanocatalyst is unveiled through a hierarchical atomic assembly strategy for synthesis, featuring an ultralow&#8208;content Ir&#9472;Ru single&#8208;atom alloy integrated into robust titanium dioxide nanowires (Ir1Ru/TiO2). This lattice&#8208;embedded structure induces the support to reduce the dissolution and excessive oxidation of Ru/Ir sites through strong interfacial coupling, significantly enhancing the corrosion resistance of catalysts. Moreover, atomically dispersed Ir induces the formation of uniquely shortened Ru&#9472;O ligand bonds, serving as stable self&#8208;limiting motifs, in contrast to the conventional formation of amorphous oxide layers. The Ir1Ru/TiO2 catalyst showcases an initial mass activity of 1971.5 A gIr+Ru&#8722;1${\mathrm{g}}_{{\mathrm{Ir + Ru}}}^{ - {\mathrm{1}}}$, enabling stable operation at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 for over 3200 h and at the rated current density of 2 A cm&#8722;2 for 2000 h in PEMWE.

         <title>Anisotropic 3D&#8208;Printed Carbon Fiber&#8208;Reinforced Liquid Metal Elastomer for Synergistic Enhancement of Electrical Conductivity, Thermal Performance, and Leakage Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the trade&#8208;off between conductivity/thermal performance and anti&#8208;leakage in liquid metal elastomer, this work develops carbon fiber&#8208;reinforced liquid metal elastomer (CFLME) via 3D&#8208;printed directional fiber alignment and Ni plating for interfacial wetting. CFLME integrates high conductivity, thermal efficiency, and anti&#8208;leakage capability for applications in electromagnetic shielding, biosensing, and thermal management.








Abstract
Developing multifunctional composites with high electrical/thermal conductivity and excellent flexibility remains a critical challenge for flexible electronics and thermal management systems. While liquid metal elastomers offer intrinsic softness and conductivity, their real&#8208;world application is hindered by the trade&#8208;off between outstanding dual conductivity (electrical and thermal) and leakage resistance. To tackle this issue, high&#8208;stability carbon fiber&#8208;reinforced liquid metal elastomer (CFLME) is fabricated via an integrated method: Ni plating on carbon fiber to enhance reactive wetting with liquid metal, followed by composite formation with elastomer and 3D printing for directional fiber alignment, yielding anisotropic CFLME. Such anisotropic architecture enables efficient conductive pathways along fiber axes, reducing the electrical percolation threshold to 25%, achieving a high electrical conductivity of 3.44 &#215; 10&#8309; S/m, and a thermal conductivity of 7.26 W/(m&#8729;K). The fiber network securely locks liquid metal, enabling zero leakage under 400% strain, 1000&#8208;cycle stretching, or 833 kPa compression. For practical applications, CFLME exhibits exceptional electromagnetic shielding (93.74 dB), high&#8208;sensitivity biosensing with an 82.62 dB signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, and efficient thermal management (16&#160;&#176;C reduction vs liquid metal elastomer). This work demonstrates a dual&#8208;innovation strategy of structural design and interfacial regulation, providing a robust solution for flexible electronics and thermal management applications with balanced performance.

&lt;p&gt;To address the trade-off between conductivity/thermal performance and anti-leakage in liquid metal elastomer, this work develops carbon fiber-reinforced liquid metal elastomer (CFLME) via 3D-printed directional fiber alignment and Ni plating for interfacial wetting. CFLME integrates high conductivity, thermal efficiency, and anti-leakage capability for applications in electromagnetic shielding, biosensing, and thermal management.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing multifunctional composites with high electrical/thermal conductivity and excellent flexibility remains a critical challenge for flexible electronics and thermal management systems. While liquid metal elastomers offer intrinsic softness and conductivity, their real-world application is hindered by the trade-off between outstanding dual conductivity (electrical and thermal) and leakage resistance. To tackle this issue, high-stability carbon fiber-reinforced liquid metal elastomer (CFLME) is fabricated via an integrated method: Ni plating on carbon fiber to enhance reactive wetting with liquid metal, followed by composite formation with elastomer and 3D printing for directional fiber alignment, yielding anisotropic CFLME. Such anisotropic architecture enables efficient conductive pathways along fiber axes, reducing the electrical percolation threshold to 25%, achieving a high electrical conductivity of 3.44 &#215; 10&#8309; S/m, and a thermal conductivity of 7.26 W/(m&#8729;K). The fiber network securely locks liquid metal, enabling zero leakage under 400% strain, 1000-cycle stretching, or 833 kPa compression. For practical applications, CFLME exhibits exceptional electromagnetic shielding (93.74 dB), high-sensitivity biosensing with an 82.62 dB signal-to-noise ratio, and efficient thermal management (16&#160;&#176;C reduction vs liquid metal elastomer). This work demonstrates a dual-innovation strategy of structural design and interfacial regulation, providing a robust solution for flexible electronics and thermal management applications with balanced performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>LDI, A Lipid Droplet Inhibitor, Disrupts Lipid Accumulation and Modulates Hepatic Lipid Profiles in Fatty Liver</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lipid droplet inhibitor (LDI), templated with large&#8208;pore mesoporous silica and functionalized with PKC&#945; C1A and lipase, targets lipid degradation in fatty liver. The LDI maintains stable association with lipid droplets, thereby suppressing their formation and expansion. It significantly alleviates liver abnormalities in vivo and effectively regulates hepatic lipid metabolism.









Abstract
Excessive lipid droplet accumulation in hepatocytes drives the progression of metabolic dysfunction&#8208;associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), often leading to inflammation and fibrosis. As obesity and metabolic syndrome rise, MASLD has become a global concern, spurring research into effective treatments. Here, the design of a Lipid droplet inhibitor (LDI) is presented, incorporating porous silica nanostructures along with PKC&#945; C1A and Candida Rugosa lipase, aimed at directly degrading lipid droplets. Through its dual&#8208;functional design, this nanostructure captures diacylglycerol using PKC&#945; C1A while hydrolyzing triacylglycerol into smaller molecular fragments via the lipase. Notably, the amphiphilic biomolecules in LDI facilitate the formation of a Pickering emulsion, ensuring stable localization at the lipid&#8208;water interface for efficient interaction with lipid droplets. LDI reduces lipid droplet formation and triglyceride levels in palmitic acid&#8208;treated HepG2 cells. In a high&#8208;fat diet&#8208;induced MASLD model, it alleviateds liver pathology and, lowered injury scores by up to 84%. Furthermore, lipidomic analysis confirmed that LDI effectively modulated the hepatic lipid profile, suggesting its potential as a nanoplatform for counteracting lipid droplet accumulation.

         <title>Nano&#8208;Particulate Surface Pinning of CeO2 Enables Durable High&#8208;Voltage Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel CeO2 nanoparticle pinning structure is developed to coat and stabilize LiCoO2 at high voltages. This coating structure addresses cathode degradation by accommodating volume changes and supressing fracture formation. Moreover, it enhances Li&#8314; transport kinetics and acts as an oxygen reservoir, ensuring interfacial and structural stability of cathode material.








Abstract
Elevating the cut&#8208;off voltage of LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) enhances capacity but increases structural instability. While surface coatings are used to mitigate structural degradation at high voltages, conventional full coverage coatings often fail to withstand the cyclic mechanical stress, resulting in crack formation and performance decay. Here, a multifunctional CeO2 nanoparticle (NP) pinning structure is designed as a surface coating on LCO (LCO@CeO2) to enable stable operation at a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6&#160;V (vs Li/Li+). This surface pinning architecture balances structural integrity with minimal inactive material usage. The CeO2 NPs are strategically anchored to the LCO surface, creating a pinning structure that accommodates volume changes and suppresses fracture formation in the cathode. Moreover, the CeO2&#8208;mediated fast Li+ transport pathways are established, improving high&#8208;rate capability. The interspersed CeO2 NPs also act as oxygen reservoirs, stabilizing reversible (O2)3&#8722; species during high&#8208;voltage oxygen anionic redox reactions. Consequently, the optimized LCO@CeO2 cathode achieves a capacity retention of 85.3% after 500 cycles at 1C and a high&#8208;rate capacity of 124.8&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10C. This CeO2 NP pinning structure offers a novel practical strategy for designing durable high&#8208;voltage layered cathodes.

         <title>Virus Enhanced Microrobots for Biofilm Eradication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biofilms resist antimicrobials across medicine, industry, and environments. We present virus&#8208;conjugated microrobots synthesized hydrothermally and magnetically actuated. Their motion and viral specificity enable targeted binding, penetration, and delivery, outperforming bare microrobots. This platform achieves rapid, efficient biofilm eradication; future work will optimize design and conjugation for scalable, clinically translatable infection control.








Abstract
Biofilms pose significant challenges in biomedical, industrial, and environmental applications due to their inherent resistance to antimicrobial agents. This study introduced an innovative and effective strategy for biofilm eradication by employing virus&#8208;conjugated microrobots (virus@microbots). These biofunctionalized microrobots are synthesized via the hydrothermal method, followed by the functionalization of the viruses. The synergy of microrobots&#8217; active movement and the virus's specificity boosted biofilm removal by enabling targeted binding, penetration, and effective delivery into the biofilm matrices. Additionally, compared to microrobots alone, virus@microbots significantly accelerated and refined the process. By integrating biological specificity with magnetic responsiveness, this approach demonstrated the efficacy of virus@microbots as a viable antibacterial strategy for biofilm elimination, offering a promising antibacterial platform for combating biofilm&#8208;associated infections. Future research should focus on optimizing microrobot design and viral conjugation protocols to enhance scalability and therapeutic specificity, paving the way for clinical translation and broader applications in infection control.

         <title>Personalized Vaccination of Tumor&#8208;Derived Antigens and STING Agonists for Specific Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Personalized immunotherapy strategy to treat tumors by its own mechanism is achieved through the hydrogel&#8208;integrated delivery of tumor&#8208;derived antigens and STING agonists, which can activate specific antitumor immune responses for prevention and inhibition of tumor growth via promotion of the maturation of antigen&#8208;presenting cells and elicitation of tumor infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes.








Abstract
Personalized vaccines have shown their promise in cancer immunotherapy, while screening of personalized antigens remains challenging. Herein, a personalized immunotherapy strategy to treat tumors by its own mechanism is reported, which is achieved through the hydrogel&#8208;integrated delivery of tumor&#8208;derived antigens and STING signaling activation. Self&#8208;assembled nanoparticles composed of gallic acid, manganese ions, and mitoxantrone are prepared to induce immunogenic cell death of tumor cells in vitro to release damage&#8208;associated&#8198;molecular&#8198;patterns and autologous antigens. Sodium alginate integrated with the released antigens and STING agonists (i.e., MSA&#8208;2) can be instantaneously cross&#8208;linked with endogenous calcium ions in vivo to form hydrogels upon subcutaneous injection. The hydrogels allow for the controlled release of autologous tumor antigens and agonists to activate specific anti&#8208;tumor immune responses via promotion of the maturation of dendritic cells and elicitation of tumor infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. As a result, the in&#8208;situ formation of hydrogel&#8208;based vaccines can prevent homologous tumor progression and inhibit metastatic tumor growth. This work outlines a straightforward and generalized strategy for personalized vaccination to enhance cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Supramolecular Interface Engineering via Interdiffusion for Reusable and Dismantlable Polymer Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible adhesion via host&#8211;guest complex formation at the polymer interface is achieved by externally controlling the complexation through applied stimuli. Neutron reflectometry analysis of the adhesion interface revealed that the presence of host&#8211;guest complexes hinders the polymer interdiffusion by despite promoting adhesion strength.








Abstract
Controllable adhesion that enables both reuse and dismantling is a key requirement for sustainable materials and device integration.

&lt;p&gt;Reversible adhesion via host&#8211;guest complex formation at the polymer interface is achieved by externally controlling the complexation through applied stimuli. Neutron reflectometry analysis of the adhesion interface revealed that the presence of host&#8211;guest complexes hinders the polymer interdiffusion by despite promoting adhesion strength.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

         <title>Highly Tunable Synaptic Modulation in Photo&#8208;Activated Remote Charge Trap Memory for Hardware&#8208;Based Fault&#8208;Tolerant Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a photo&#8208;activated remote charge&#8208;trap memory utilizing defect&#8208;engineered hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN), achieving a synaptic tunability ratio (STR) of 4,380. This device enables optical control of the learning rate, facilitating fault&#8208;tolerant training on mislabeled datasets and enhancing recognition accuracy while reducing peripheral overhead in in&#8208;memory computing systems.









Abstract
The rapid expansion of deep learning applications for unstructured data analysis has led to a substantial increase in energy consumption. This increase is primarily due to matrix&#8208;vector multiplication operations, which dominate the energy usage during inference. Although in&#8208;memory computing technologies have alleviated some inefficiencies caused by parallel computing, they still face challenges with broader computational algorithms required for advanced deep learning models. In real&#8208;world data collection scenarios, datasets often contain &#8220;noisy labels&#8221; (errors in annotations), which cause recognition inefficiencies in conventional in&#8208;memory computing. Here, a hardware&#8208;based fault&#8208;tolerant learning algorithm designed for artificial synapses with tunable synaptic operation is proposed. In this scheme, the devices simultaneously process both learning and regulatory signals, enabling selective attenuation of weight updates induced by mistraining signals. Utilizing a high synaptic tunability ratio of 4380 realized in photo&#8208;activated remote charge trap memory devices based on defect&#8208;engineered hexagonal boron nitride(h&#8208;BN), the system nearly completely suppresses weight update signals from mislabeled data, which leads to improved recognition accuracy on the mislabeled Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset. These results demonstrate that tunable synaptic devices can enhance training efficiency in in&#8208;memory computing systems for mislabeled datasets, thereby reducing the need for extensive data cleansing and preparation.

         <title>Revealing Capacitive Slope Capacity of Open Pore Carbon for Ultrahigh&#8208;Rate Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different from the well&#8208;investigated intercalation/filling reactions, this work demonstrates an interesting sodium&#8208;ion storage mechanism: an ultrahigh&#8208;rate electric double&#8208;layer capacitive sodium&#8208;ion storage in disordered, open&#8208;pore carbon in a large potential window of 3&#8211;0.01 V vs Na+/Na, resulting in an exceptionally high initial coulombic efficiency of 92.4% and ultrahigh&#8208;rate capabilities.








Abstract
Disordered carbon materials exhibit slope and plateau Na+ storage capacities. Compared with the well&#8208;investigated plateau capacities from the intercalation/filling mechanism, the &#8220;capacitive&#8221; slope storage remains relatively unidentified. Herein, the effects of open pore sizes and solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layers are investigated on slope capacity and thus categorize the &#8220;capacitive&#8221; behaviors into three distinct scenarios. Conventionally, the complete desolvation and pseudocapacitive Na+ slope capacities arise from the sieving of ethylene carbonate (EC)&#8208;SEI layers. Differently, an electric double&#8208;layer (EDL) capacitive adsorption of partially desolvated Na+ ions is revealed in large open pores of 0.5&#8211;2&#160;nm in the diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DGDE) electrolyte in a large potential window of 3&#8211;0.01&#160;V vs Na+/Na. Remarkably, DGDE&#8208;SEI does not block open pores or sieve solvation shells, resulting in an exceptionally high initial coulombic efficiency of 92.4% and ultrahigh&#8208;rate capabilities. When the open pore size decreases to &lt;0.5&#160;nm (accessible to CO2 but inaccessible to Ar) or becomes closed pores in DGDE electrolyte, the narrow pores themselves sieve solvation shells and subsequent pseudocapacitive Na+ storage for slope capacity. The EDL capacitive slope capacity of open porous carbon highlights the ultrafast (dis)charging abilities and stable cycles, which are highly promising for high&#8208;power sodium&#8208;ion storage devices.
