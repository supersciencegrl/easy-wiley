         <title>Sodium&#8208;Antimony&#8208;Telluride Intermetallic Allows Sodium Metal Cycling at 100% Depth of Discharge and as Anode&#8208;Free Metal Battery</title>

Abstract
We employed repeated cold rolling and folding to fabricate a metallurgical composite of sodium&#8208;antimony&#8208;telluride Na2(Sb2/6Te3/6Vac1/6) dispersed in electrochemically active sodium metal, termed &#8220;NST&#8208;Na&#8221;. This new intermetallic has a vacancy&#8208;rich thermodynamically stable fcc structure and enables state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrochemical performance in widely employed carbonate and ether electrolytes. NST&#8208;Na achieves 100% depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge (DOD) in 1 M NaPF6 in G2, with 15 mAh cm&#8211;2 at 1&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 and CE of 99.4%, for 1000 hours&#160;of plating/stripping. Sodium metal batteries (SMB, NMB) with NST&#8208;Na and Na3V2(PO4)3&#160;(NVP) or sulfur cathodes give significantly improved energy, cycling and CE (&gt; 99%). Anode&#8208;Free battery with NST collector and NVP obtains 0.23% capacity decay per cycle. Imaging and tomography using (cryo&#8208;)FIB sectioning, (cryo&#8208;)SEM, and (cryo&#8208;)TEM imaging indicate that sodium metal fills the open space inside the self&#8208;supporting sodiophilic NST skeleton, resulting in dense (pore&#8208;free and SEI&#8208;free) metal deposits with flat surfaces. The baseline Na deposit consists of filament&#8208;like dendrites and Dead Metal, intermixed with pores and SEI. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that uniqueness of NST lies in the thermodynamic stability of Na atoms (rather than clusters) on its surface that leads to planar wetting, and in its own stability that prevents decomposition during cycling.

         <title>Interfacial Manipulation via In Situ Grown ZnSe Cultivator toward Highly Reversible Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ grown ZnSe overlayer functioning as a cultivator can guide oriented growth of Zn (002) plane at the infancy stage of stripping/plating cycles, thereby inhibiting the formation of Zn dendrites and the occurrence of side reactions.








Abstract
Zn metal anode has garnered growing scientific and industrial interest owing to its appropriate redox potential, low cost, and high safety. Nevertheless, the instability of Zn anode caused by dendrite formation, hydrogen evolution, and side reactions has greatly hampered its commercialization. Herein, an in situ grown ZnSe overlayer is crafted over one side of commercial Zn foil via chemical vapor deposition in a scalable manner, aiming to achieve optimized electrolyte/Zn interfaces with large&#8208;scale viability. Impressively, thus&#8208;derived ZnSe coating functions as a cultivator to guide oriented growth of Zn (002) plane at the infancy stage of stripping/plating cycles, thereby inhibiting the formation of Zn dendrites and the occurrence of side reactions. As a result, high cyclic stability (1530 h at 1.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/1.0&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2; 172 h at 30.0&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2/10.0 mAh cm&#8722;2) in symmetric cells is harvested. Meanwhile, when paired with V2O5 based cathode, assembled full cell achieves an outstanding capacity (194.5 mAh g&#8722;1) and elongated lifespan (a&#160;capacity retention of 84% after 1000 cycles) at 5.0 A g&#8722;1. The reversible Zn anode enabled by the interfacial manipulation strategy via ZnSe cultivator is anticipated to satisfy the demand of commercial use.

         <title>Wafer&#8208;Scale Electroactive Nanoporous Silicon: Large and Fully Reversible Electrochemo&#8208;Mechanical Actuation in Aqueous Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For large&#8208;scale nanoporous silicon cantilevers in aqueous electrolytes, with laser cantilever bending experiments, electrosorption&#8208;induced mechanical stress generation of up to 600&#8201;kPa that is reversible and adjustable at will by low operation voltages of 1&#8201;V is demonstrated. A comparison with planar silicon surfaces reveals mechanistic insights on the observed electrocapillarity upon ion adsorption and desorption.








Abstract
Nanoporosity in silicon results in interface&#8208;dominated mechanics, fluidics, and photonics that are often superior to the ones of the bulk material. However, their active control, for example, by electronic stimuli, is challenging due to the absence of intrinsic piezoelectricity in the base material. Here, for large&#8208;scale nanoporous silicon cantilevers wetted by aqueous electrolytes, electrosorption&#8208;induced mechanical stress generation of up to 600&#8201;kPa that is reversible and adjustable at will by potential variations of &#8776;1&#8201;V is shown. Laser cantilever bending experiments in combination with in operando voltammetry and step coulombmetry allow this large electro&#8208;actuation to be traced to the concerted action of 100 billions of parallel nanopores per square centimeter cross&#8208;section and determination of the capacitive charge&#8211;stress coupling parameter upon ion adsorption and desorption as well as the intimately related stress actuation dynamics for perchloric and isotonic saline solutions. A comparison with planar silicon surfaces reveals mechanistic insights on the observed electrocapillarity (Hellmann&#8211;Feynman interactions) with respect to the importance of oxide formation and wall roughness on the single&#8208;nanopore scale. The observation of robust electrochemo&#8208;mechanical actuation in a mainstream semiconductor with wafer&#8208;scale, self&#8208;organized nanoporosity opens up novel opportunities for on&#8208;chip integrated stress generation and actuorics at exceptionally low operation&#160;voltages.

         <title>Interfacial Electrostatic&#8208;Interaction&#8208;Enhanced Photomultiplication for Ultrahigh External Quantum Efficiency of Organic Photodiodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to boost the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of photomultiplication&#8208;type organic photodiodes (OPDs) is suggested by stabilizing trapped electron states within the active layer via electrostatic interactions. By introducing an ionic electrolyte interfacial layer and by the resulting built&#8208;in electrostatic interaction, an ultrahigh EQE (&gt;2&#160;000&#160;000%), responsivity (&gt; 10&#160;000 A W&#8722;1), and visible specific detectivity (&gt;1014 Jones) for OPDs is reported.








Abstract
A photomultiplication&#8208;type organic photodiode (PM&#8208;OPD), where an electric double layer (EDL) is strategically embedded, is demonstrated, with an exceptionally high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 2&#160;210&#160;000%, responsivity of 11&#160;200 A W&#8722;1, specific detectivity of 2.11 &#215; 1014 Jones, and gain&#8211;bandwidth product of 1.92 &#215; 107&#160;Hz, as well as high reproducibility. A polymer electrolyte, poly(9,9&#8208;bis(3&#8242;&#8208;(N,N&#8208;dimethyl)&#8208;N&#8208;ethylammoinium&#8208;propyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;fluorene)&#8208;alt&#8208;2,7&#8208;(9,9&#8208;dioctylfluorene))dibromide is employed as a work&#8208;function&#8208;modifying layer of indium tin oxide (ITO) to construct an EDL&#8208;embedded Schottky junction with p&#8208;type polymer semiconductor, poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene&#8208;diyl), resulting in not only advantageous tuning of the work function of ITO but also an enhancement of the electron&#8208;trapping efficiency due to electrostatic interaction between exposed cations and trapped electrons within isolated acceptor domains. The effects of the EDL on the energetics of the trapped electron states and thus on the gain generation mechanism are confirmed by numerical simulations based on the drift&#8211;diffusion approximation of charge carriers. The feasibility of the fabricated high&#8208;EQE PM&#8208;OPD especially for weak light detection is demonstrated via a pixelated prototype image sensor. It is believed that this new OPD platform opens up the possibility for the ultrahigh&#8208;sensitivity organic image sensors, while maintaining the advantageous properties of organics.

It is believed that this new OPD platform opens up the possibility for the ultrahigh-sensitivity organic image sensors, while maintaining the advantageous properties of organics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Importance of Surface Adsorbates in Solution&#8208;Processed Thermoelectric Materials: The Case of SnSe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polycrystalline SnSe is prepared from surfactant&#8208;free particles prepared in solution. Ionic species adsorbed on the surface compensate for the particles&#8242; charge and remain during processing. The adsorbates affect the nano/microstructure of the final material and its transport properties. In the case of sodium, it remains as a dopant and forms secondary phases that induce energy filtering effects.








Abstract
Solution synthesis of particles emerges as an alternative to prepare thermoelectric materials with less demanding processing conditions than conventional solid&#8208;state synthetic methods. However, solution synthesis generally involves the presence of additional molecules or ions belonging to the precursors or added to enable solubility and/or regulate nucleation and growth. These molecules or ions can end up in the particles as surface adsorbates and interfere in the material properties. This work demonstrates that ionic adsorbates, in particular Na+ ions, are electrostatically adsorbed in SnSe particles synthesized in water and play a crucial role not only in directing the material nano/microstructure but also in determining the transport properties of the consolidated material. In dense pellets prepared by sintering SnSe particles, Na remains within the crystal lattice as dopant, in dislocations, precipitates, and forming grain boundary complexions. These results highlight the importance of considering all the possible unintentional impurities to establish proper structure&#8211;property relationships and control material properties in solution&#8208;processed thermoelectric materials.

This review analyzes the key factors that hinder the reversible conversion of conversion&#8208;type materials, provides a fundamental understanding of graphene&#8208;, or graphene&#8208;like carbon&#8208;supported atomically dispersed metal catalysts (G&#8208;ADMCs), and provides guidance on the bifunctional G&#8208;ADMCs to be used in high&#8208;performance next&#8208;generation batteries, including aqueous metal&#8211;air batteries, nonaqueous alkali metal&#8208;O2 and &#8208;CO2 batteries, alkali metal&#8208;chalcogen batteries, and alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Next&#8208;generation batteries based on conversion reactions, including aqueous metal&#8211;air batteries, nonaqueous alkali metal&#8208;O2 and &#8208;CO2 batteries, alkali metal&#8208;chalcogen batteries, and alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries have attracted great interest. However, their use is restricted by inefficient reversible conversion of active agents. Developing bifunctional catalysts to accelerate the conversion reaction kinetics in both discharge and charge processes is urgently needed. Graphene&#8208;, or graphene&#8208;like carbon&#8208;supported atomically dispersed metal catalysts (G&#8208;ADMCs) have been demonstrated to show excellent activity in various electrocatalytic reactions, making them promising candidates. Different from G&#8208;ADMCs for catalysis, which only require high activity in one direction, G&#8208;ADMCs for rechargeable batteries should provide high activity in both discharging and charging. This review provides guidance for the design and fabrication of bifunctional G&#8208;ADMCs for next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries based on conversion reactions. The key challenges that prevent their reversible conversion, the origin of the activity of bifunctional G&#8208;ADMCs, and the current design principles of bifunctional G&#8208;ADMCs for highly reversible conversion, have been analyzed and highlighted for each conversion&#8208;type battery. Finally, a summary and outlook on the development of bifunctional G&#8208;ADMC materials for next&#8208;generation batteries with a high energy density and excellent energy efficiency are given.

         <title>An Axially Continuous Graphene&#8211;Copper Wire for High&#8208;Power Transmission: Thermoelectrical Characterization and Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Axially continuous graphene layers on microscale&#8208;diameter copper wires offer significantly enhanced thermoelectrical properties including a 450% increase in the current density breakdown limit. The application of extremely large current densities (&gt;400 000 A cm&#8722;2) through these innovative graphene&#8211;metal wires is possibly due to 224% higher surface heat dissipation, 41% higher electrical conductivity, and improved thermal stability (i.e., 41.2% lower resistivity after thermal cycles up to 450 &#176;C).








Abstract
The demand for high&#8208;power electrical transmission continues to increase with technical advances in electric vehicles, unmanned drones, portable devices, and deployable military applications. In this study, significantly enhanced electrical properties (i.e., a 450% increase in the current density breakdown limit) are demonstrated by synthesizing axially continuous graphene layers on microscale&#8208;diameter wires. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the observed enhancements, the electrical properties of pure copper wires and axially continuous graphene&#8211;copper (ACGC) wires with three different diameters are characterized while controlling the experimental conditions, including ambient temperature, gases, and pressure. The study reveals that the main mechanism that allows the application of extremely large current densities (&gt;400 000 A cm&#8722;2) through the ACGC wires is threefold: the continuous graphene layers considerably improve: 1) surface heat dissipation (224% higher), 2) electrical conductivity (41% higher), and 3) thermal stability (41.2% lower resistivity after thermal cycles up to 450&#160;&#176;C), compared with pure copper wires. In addition, it is observed, through the use of high&#8208;speed camera images, that the ACGC wires exhibit very different failure behavior near the current density limit, compared with the pure copper wires.

         <title>Highly Selective and Sensitive Detection of Volatile Sulfur Compounds by Ionically Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through systematical design and comparison, Cu&#8208;TCPP stands out from a series of ionically conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (IC&#8208;MOFs) for volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) detection. H2S and CH3SH can be detected at concentrations down to 1 ppb and 1 ppm, respectively. The sensors display outstanding selectivity toward VSCs, and their low&#8208;cost and facile preparation make the devices disposable.








Abstract
High selectivity to specific analyte is essential for chemical sensors but difficult to achieve. For most chemical sensors, although the response to the target analyte can be more significant than interference analytes, they still show obvious responses to the interference analytes. Here, highly selective chemical sensors are developed with negligible responses to other interference vapors. Instead of the widely investigated electronically conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (EC&#8208;MOFs), ionically conductive MOFs (IC&#8208;MOFs) are used as the sensing materials, and the unique interaction between the ion charge carrier and the analyte is utilized to achieve high sensing selectivity. Through the modulation of the metal nodes (Cu, Co, Ni, Zn, Mg) and organic ligands (H2TCPP, H2THPP, H4BTEC), sensor arrays based on a set of IC&#8208;MOFs are fabricated and achieve highly selective detection toward volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs). H2S and CH3SH can be selectively detected at concentrations down to 1 ppb and 1&#160;ppm, respectively. The facile preparation and low cost endow the device with disposability. These results suggest new approaches for the development of highly selective chemical sensors.

         <title>Gas&#8208;Phase Fluorination of Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, scalable strategy is attempted using a direct gas&#8208;phase fluorination technique to fluorinate&#160;hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The nature of fluorine bonding to the&#160;hBN lattice and their chemical coordination are evaluated using various analytical techniques and theoretical models. Interestingly, the derived F&#8208;hBN displays significant improvement in its thermal and friction properties and displays a semiconducting behavior.








Abstract
Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has received much attention in recent years as a 2D dielectric material with potential applications ranging from catalysts to electronics. hBN is a stable covalent compound with a planar hexagonal lattice and is relatively unreactive to most chemical environments, making the chemical functionalization of hBN challenging. Here, a simple, scalable strategy to fluorinate hBN using a direct gas&#8208;phase fluorination technique is reported. The nature of fluorine bonding to the hBN lattice and their chemical coordination are described based on various characterization studies and theoretical models. The fluorine functionalized hBN shows a bandgap reduction and displays a semiconducting behavior due to the fluorination process. Additionally, the fluorinated hBN shows significant improvement in its thermal and friction properties, which could be substantial in applications such as lubricants and thermal fluids. Theory and simulations reveal that the enhanced friction properties of fluorinated hBN result from reduced inter&#8208;planar interaction energy by electrostatic repulsion of intercalated fluorine atoms between hBN layers without significant disruption of the in&#8208;plane lattice. This technique paves the way for the fluorination of several other 2D structures for various applications such as magnetism and functional nanoscale electronic devices.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Enabled Phase Transition of Periodic Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strain&#8208;enabled phase transition of stretchable periodic metasurfaces between any two Bravais lattices, which reflect their symmetry, is demonstrated analytically and experimentally. Such transition offers a flexible way to engineer the resonance regime and dispersion relation of metasurfaces. In particular, the strain&#8208;induced symmetry lowering leads to linearly and circularly polarized dichroism, which is demonstrated for information decoding.








Abstract
Phase transitions are universal in solid&#8208;state matters, as well as in periodic electromagnetic metasurfaces&#8212;the photonic analogues of crystals. Although such transitions dictate the properties of active metasurfaces, universal ways to describe the structure transition of periodic metasurfaces have not yet been established. Here, the authors report the strain&#8208;enabled phase transition (or lattice deformation) of stretchable metasurfaces with the crystallographic description. They analytically and experimentally demonstrate the phase transition of plasmonic lattices between two arbitrary 2D Bravais lattices under certain strain configurations. The strain&#8208;induced symmetry lowering of the structures gives rise to optical anisotropy upon polarization, namely, linearly and circularly polarized dichroism. They further demonstrate the potential of phase transition in information decoding with applied strain. Interpreting the phase transition of metasurfaces from a standpoint of symmetry would accelerate the discovery of emergent properties, and provide a generalizable approach to designing active metasurfaces.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Perovskite Field&#8208;Effect Transistor Artificial Synapses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processed perovskite artificial synapse is demonstrated that emulates a biological synapse. The perovskite synapse employs a field&#8208;effect transistor layout with a ferroelectric gate dielectric, wherein the channel conductance can be updated by ferroelectric polarization in a non&#8208;volatile fashion. The perovskite artificial synapse emulates essential synaptic behavior, offering a route to utilize perovskites in neuromorphic devices.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites are distinctive semiconductors that exhibit both ionic and electronic transport and are promising for artificial synapses. However, developing a 3&#8208;terminal transistor artificial synapse with the perovskite channel remains elusive due to the lack of a proper technique to regulate mobile ions in a non&#8208;volatile manner. Here, a solution&#8208;processed perovskite transistor is reported for artificial synapses through the implementation of a ferroelectric gate. The ferroelectric polarization provides a non&#8208;volatile electric field on the perovskite, leading to fixation of the mobile ions and hence modulation of the electronic conductance of the channel. Multi&#8208;state channel conductance is realized by partial ferroelectric polarization. The ferroelectric&#8208;gated perovskite transistor is successfully used as an artificial synapse that emulates basic synaptic functions such as long&#8208;term plasticity with excellent linearity, short&#8208;term as well as spike&#8208;timing&#8208;dependent plasticity. The strategy to regulate ion dynamics in the perovskites using the ferroelectric gate suggests a generic route to employ perovskites for synaptic electronics.

         <title>Optimized Colossal Near&#8208;Field Thermal Radiation Enabled by Manipulating Coupled Plasmon Polariton Geometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coupled plasmon polaritons excited by gap&#8208;bridging multilayer graphene/SU8&#160;heterostructures lead to near&#8208;perfect photon&#8208;tunneling probability and improve the state of the art by one order of magnitude in near&#8208;field thermal radiation (NFTR). Electric tuning of graphene Fermi&#8208;level allows for optimized NFTR enhancement. Colossal energy transfer should inspire potential applications in thermophotovoltaic and so on.








Abstract
Collective optoelectronic phenomena such as plasmons and phonon polaritons can drive processes in many branches of nanoscale science. Classical physics predicts that a perfect thermal emitter operates at the black body limit. Numerous experiments have shown that surface phonon polaritons allow emission two orders of magnitude above the limit at a gap distance of &#8776;50&#160;nm. This work shows that a supported multilayer graphene structure improves the state of the art by around one order of magnitude with a &#8776;1129&#8208;fold&#8208;enhancement at a gap distance of &#8776;55&#160;nm. Coupled surface plasmon polaritons at mid&#8208; and far&#8208;infrared frequencies allow for near&#8208;unity photon tunneling across a broad swath of k&#8208;space enabling the improved result. Electric tuning of the Fermi&#8208;level allows for the detailed characterization and optimization of the colossal nanoscale heat transfer.

         <title>Loading Single&#8208;Ni Atoms on Assembled Hollow N&#8208;Rich Carbon Plates for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Assembled hollow N&#8208;rich carbon plates with single&#8208;Ni atoms (Ni&#8208;NC(AHP)) are constructed using a novel dual&#8208;linker zeolitic tetrazolate framework (ZTF) as precursor. The open structure and high external surface area enable the Ni&#8208;NC(AHP) catalyst with fast mass transfer and highly exposed single&#8208;Ni sites towards efficient CO2 electroreduction.








Abstract
The rational design of catalysts&#8217; spatial structure is vitally important to boost catalytic performance through exposing the active sites, enhancing the mass transfer, and confining the reactants. Herein, a dual&#8208;linker zeolitic tetrazolate framework&#8208;engaged strategy is developed to construct assembled hollow plates (AHP) of N&#8208;rich carbon (NC), which is loaded with single&#8208;Ni atoms to form a highly efficient electrocatalyst (designated as Ni&#8208;NC(AHP)). In the carbonization process, the thermally unstable linker (5&#8208;aminotetrazole) serves as the self&#8208;sacrificial template and the other linker (2&#8208;methylimidazole) mainly serves as the carbon and nitrogen source to form hollow NC matrix. The formed Ni&#8208;NC(AHP) catalyst possesses enhanced mesoporosity and more available surface area, thus promoting mass transport and affording abundant accessible single&#8208;Ni sites. These features contribute to remarkable performance for electrochemical CO2 reduction with exceptionally high selectivity of nearly 100% towards CO in a wide potential range and dramatically enhanced CO partial current density.

By introducing p&#8208; and n&#8208;type charge transport layers in the coplanar&#8208;structured perovskite X&#8208;ray detector to isolate the contact between the electrode and the perovskite, the interfacial electrochemical&#8208;reaction&#8208;induced polarization is effectively suppressed under large electric field up to 1000&#160;V cm&#8722;1, which results in the superior device performance with a low X&#8208;ray detection limit down to 0.1 nGyair s&#8722;1.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskites have exhibited bright prospects in high&#8208;sensitivity X&#8208;ray detection. However, they generally suffer from the severe field&#8208;driven polarization issue that remarkably deteriorates the detection performance. Here, it is demonstrated that the interfacial electrochemical reaction between Au electrodes and halogen in MAPbI3 single crystals (SCs) is the major source of the dark current polarization in the metal&#8211;semiconductor&#8211;metal (MSM)&#8208;structured perovskite X&#8208;ray detectors at the initial stage of biasing. By introducing the p&#8208; and n&#8208;type charge transport layers to isolate the electrodes from contacting the SC surface, the polarization is fully eliminated under a large electric field up to 1000&#160;V cm&#8722;1. Moreover, the resultant lateral p&#8211;i&#8211;n heterojunction suppresses the dark current of the devices by nearly 3 orders of magnitude as compared to the MSM counterparts and therefore enables a high sensitivity of 5.2 &#215; 106&#160;&#181;C Gy&#8722;1air cm&#8722;2 and a record low X&#8208;ray detection limit down to 0.1 nGyair s&#8722;1. The excellent biasing stability and sensitivity of the devices allow to prepare the linear detector arrays for X&#8208;ray imaging applications.

         <title>Dense Silicon Nanowire Networks Grown on a Stainless&#8208;Steel Fiber Cloth: A Flexible and Robust Anode for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dense and tunable mass loading of Si NWs is directly grown on a highly conductive, flexible, fire&#8208;resistant, and mechanically robust interwoven stainless&#8208;steel fiber cloth (SSFC) by a simple and readily scalable glassware setup. Si NWs@SSFC anode with a mass loadings of 1.32&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 achieves a stable areal capacity of &#8776;2 mAh cm&#8722;2 after 200 cycles.








Abstract
Silicon nanowires (Si NWs) are a promising anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to their high specific capacity. Achieving adequate mass loadings for binder&#8208;free Si NWs is restricted by low surface area, mechanically unstable and poorly conductive current collectors (CCs), as well as complicated/expensive fabrication routes. Herein, a tunable mass loading and dense Si NW growth on a conductive, flexible, fire&#8208;resistant, and mechanically robust interwoven stainless&#8208;steel fiber cloth (SSFC) using a simple glassware setup is reported. The SSFC CC facilitates dense growth of Si NWs where its open structure allows a buffer space for expansion/contraction during Li&#8208;cycling. The Si NWs@SSFC anode displays a stable performance for 500 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of &gt;99.5%. Galvanostatic cycling of the Si NWs@SSFC anode with a mass loading of 1.32&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 achieves a stable areal capacity of &#8776;2 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 0.2 C after 200 cycles. Si NWs@SSFC anodes with different mass loadings are characterized before and after cycling by scanning and transmission electron microscopy to examine the effects of Li&#8208;cycling on the morphology. Notably, this approach allows the large&#8208;scale fabrication of robust and flexible binder&#8208;free Si NWs@SSFC architectures, making it viable for practical applications in high energy density LIBs.

         <title>Amine&#8208;Functionalized Carbon Nanodot Electrocatalysts Converting Carbon Dioxide to Methane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ amine functionalization is a general strategy that can be applied to nanoscale carbon catalysts, i.e., in the form of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) regardless of their crystal structure, to promote the selectivity and production rate of CH4 in CO2 electroreduction. Specifically, amine functionalized nitrogen&#8208;doped GQDs achieve CH4 Faradaic efficiency and partial current density of industrial relevance.








Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to methane (CH4), which can be used not only as fuel but also as a hydrogen carrier, has drawn great attention for use in supporting carbon capture and utilization. The design of active and selective electrocatalysts with exceptional CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion efficiency is highly desirable; however, it remains a challenge. Here a molecular tuning strategy&#8722;in situ amine functionalization of nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene quantum dots (GQDs) for highly efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion is presented. Amine functionalized nitrogen&#8208;doped GQDs achieve a CH4 Faradic efficiency (FE) of 63% and 46%, respectively, at CH4 partial current densities of 170 and 258&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, approximating to or even outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts. These GQDs also convert CO2 to C2 products mainly including C2H4 and C2H5OH with a maximum FE of &#8776;10%. A systematic analysis reveals that the CH4 yield varies linearly with amine group content, whereas the C2 production rate is positively dependent on pyridinic N dopant content. This work provides insight into the rational design of carbon catalysts with CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion efficiency at the industrially relevant level.

         <title>Controllable SiOx Nanorod Memristive Neuron for Probabilistic Bayesian Inference</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A probabilistic SiOx nanorod memristive neuron is fabricated by employing the glancing angle deposition technique. Due to the SiOx nanorod structure, a multitude of Si switching filaments at many SiOx nanorod edges can be formed, leading to different probabilistic activation functions with controllability. Furthermore, the self&#8208;resting neural operation and probabilistic Bayesian inferences are also demonstrated with the fabricated device.








Abstract
Modern artificial neural network technology using a deterministic computing framework is faced with a critical challenge in dealing with massive data that are largely unstructured and ambiguous. This challenge demands the advances of an elementary physical device for tackling these uncertainties. Here, we&#160;designed and fabricated a SiOx nanorod memristive device by employing the glancing angle deposition (GLAD) technique, suggesting a controllable stochastic artificial neuron that can mimic the fundamental integrate&#8208;and&#8208;fire signaling and stochastic dynamics of a biological neuron. The nanorod structure provides the random distribution of multiple nanopores all across the active area, capable of forming a multitude of Si filaments at many SiOx nanorod edges after the electromigration process, leading to a stochastic switching event with very high dynamic range (&#8776;5.15 &#215; 1010) and low energy (&#8776;4.06 pJ). Different probabilistic activation (ProbAct) functions in a sigmoid form are implemented, showing its controllability with low variation by manufacturing and electrical programming schemes. Furthermore, as an application prospect, based on the suggested memristive neuron, we&#160;demonstrated the self&#8208;resting neural operation with the local circuit configuration and revealed probabilistic Bayesian inferences for genetic regulatory networks with low normalized mean squared errors (&#8776;2.41 &#215; 10&#8208;2) and its robustness to the ProbAct variation.

This review highlights the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art noncovalent strategies available for the construction of color&#8208;tunable luminescent materials.








Abstract
Constructing multicolor photoluminescent materials with tunable properties is an attractive research objective on account of their abundant applications in materials science and biomedical engineering. By comparison with covalent synthesis, supramolecular chemistry has provided a more competitive and promising strategy for the production of organic materials and the regulation of their photophysical properties. By taking advantage of dynamic and reversible noncovalent bonding interactions, supramolecular strategies can, not only simplify the design and fabrication of organic materials, but can also endow them with dynamic reversibility and stimuli responsiveness, making it much easier to adjust the superstructures and properties of the materials. Occasionally, it is possible to introduce emergent properties into these materials, which are absent in their precursor compounds, broadening their potential applications. In an attempt to highlight the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art noncovalent strategies available for the construction of smart luminescent materials, an overview of color&#8208;tunable materials is presented in this Review, with the emphasis being placed on the examples drawn from host&#8211;guest complexes, supramolecular assemblies and crystalline materials. The noncovalent synthesis of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent materials and the modulation of their luminescent properties are also described. Finally, future directions and scientific challenges in the emergent field of color&#8208;tunable supramolecular emissive materials are discussed.

         <title>Hybrid Electrolyte with Dual&#8208;Anion&#8208;Aggregated Solvation Sheath for Stabilizing High&#8208;Voltage Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A moderate&#8208;concentration electrolyte with a dual&#8208;anion&#8208;aggregated Li+ solvation sheath at inner is developed, which guarantees the reversibility of Li plating/stripping and meets the requirements of high&#8208;voltage cathode. This peculiar solvated structure plays an important role in tailoring the electrode/electrolyte interphases, so as to realize the long&#8208;term cyclability of lithium&#8208;metal batteries with limited Li anodes and LiNi0.85Co0.10Al0.05O2 cathodes.








Abstract
Lithium (Li)&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) with high&#8208;voltage cathodes and limited Li&#8208;metal anodes are crucial to realizing high&#8208;energy storage. However, functional electrolytes that are compatible with both high&#8208;voltage cathodes and Li anodes are required for their developments. In this study, the use of a moderate&#8208;concentration LiPF6 and LiNO3 dual&#8208;salt electrolyte composed of ester and ether co&#8208;solvents (fluoroethylene carbonate/dimethoxyethane, FEC/DME), which forms a unique Li+ solvation with aggregated dual anions, that is, PF6&#8722; and NO3&#8722;, is proposed to stabilize high&#8208;voltage LMBs. Mechanistic studies reveal that such a solvation sheath improves the Li plating/stripping kinetics and induces the generation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer with gradient heterostructure and high Young's modulus on the anode, and a thin and robust cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) film. Therefore, this novel electrolyte enables colossal Li deposits with a high Coulombic efficiency (&#8776;98.9%) for 450 cycles at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2. The as&#8208;assembled Li&#449;LiNi0.85Co0.10Al0.05O2 full batteries deliver an excellent lifespan and capacity retention at 4.3 V with a rigid negative&#8208;to&#8208;positive capacity ratio. This electrolyte system with a dual&#8208;anion&#8208;aggregated solvation structure provides insights into the interfacial chemistries through solvation regulation for high&#8208;voltage LMBs.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Carrier Transport in Quasi&#8208;2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Perovskites Solar Cells</title>

Abstract
In recent years, two&#8208;dimensional Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (2DRP) perovskite materials have been explored as emerging semiconductor materials in solar cells owing to their excellent stability and structural diversity. Although 2DRP perovskites have achieved photovoltaic efficiencies exceeding 19%, their widespread use is hindered by their inferior charge&#8208;carrier transport properties in the presence of diverse organic spacer cations, compared to that of traditional 3D perovskites. Hence, a systematic understanding of the 2D perovskite's carrier transport mechanism is critical for the development of high&#8208;performance 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this review, we summarize the recent advances in the carrier behavior of 2DRP PSCs and provide guidelines for successfully enhancing carrier transport. First, we discuss the composition and crystal structure of 2DRP perovskite materials that affect carrier transport. Then, we evaluate the features of 2DRP perovskite films (phase separation, grain orientation, crystallinity kinetics, etc.), which are closely related to carrier transport. Next, we reveal the principal direction of carrier transport guiding the selection of the transport layer. Finally, we propose an outlook and rationalize strategies for enhancing carrier transport in high&#8208;performance PSCs.

         <title>Polarimetric Image Sensor and Fermi Level Shifting Induced Multi&#8208;Channel Transition Based on Two&#8208;dimensional PdPS</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials have been attracted highly interest in recent years due to their low structural symmetry, excellent photoresponse and high air stability. However, most 2D materials can only response to specific light, which limits the development of wide spectrum photodetectors. Proper band gap and the regulation of Fermi level are foundations for realizing electronic multi&#8208;channel transitions, which is an effective method to achieve wide spectral response. Herein, a noble 2D material, Palladium phosphide sulfide (PdPS), is designed and synthesized. The band gap of PdPS is around 2.1&#160;eV and the formation of S vacancies, interstitial Pd and P atoms promote the Fermi level very close to the conduction band. Therefore, PdPS&#8208;based photodetector shows impressive wide spectral response from solar blind ultraviolet (SBUV) to near infrared (NIR) based on the multi&#8208;channel tranisiton. It also exhibits superior optoelectrical properties with photoresponsivity (R) of 1&#215;103 A/W and detectivity (D*) of 4&#215;1011 Jones at 532&#160;nm. Moreover, PdPS exhibits good performance of polarization detection with dichroic ratio of &#8764;3.7 at 808&#160;nm. Significantly, it achieves polarimetric imaging and hidden target detection in complex environments through active detection.

         <title>Macrocycle&#8208;based porous organic polymers for separation, sensing, and catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
With the rapid development of materials science, porous organic polymers (POPs) have received remarkable attentions because of their unique properties such as the exceptionally high surface area and flexible molecular design. The ability to incorporate specific functions in a precise manner makes POPs promising platforms for a myriad of applications in molecular adsorption, separation and catalysis. Therefore, many different types of POPs have been rationally designed and synthesized to expand the scope of advanced materials, endowing them with distinct structures and properties. Recently, supramolecular macrocycles with excellent host&#8211;guest complexation abilities are emerging as powerful crosslinkers for developing novel POPs with hierarchical structures and improved performance, which can be well&#8208;organized at different spatial scales. Macrocycle&#8208;based POPs could have unusual porous, adsorptive and optical properties when compared to their non&#8208;macrocycle&#8208;incorporated counterparts. This cooperation provides valuable insights for the molecular&#8208;level understanding of skeletal complexity and diversity. We aptly summarize here the research advances of macrocycle&#8208;based POPs by showing their syntheses, properties and applications in terms of separation, sensing and catalysis. Finally, we delineate the current challenging issues in this exciting research field and offer a comprehensive outlook for their future directions.

Abstract
The number of publications on perovskite solar cells (PSC) continues to grow exponentially. Although the efficiency of PSC is exceeded 25.5%, not every research laboratory can reproduce this result or even pass the border of 20%. Unfortunately, it is not always clear which dominating mechanism is responsible for the performance drop. Here, we develop a simple method of light intensity analysis of JV parameters allowing the understanding what are the mechanisms appearing in the solar cell and limiting device performance. The developed method is supported by the drift&#8208;diffusion model and aimed to help in the explanation of the parasitic losses from the interface or bulk recombination, series, or shunt resistance in the perovskite solar cell. This method can help not only point on the dominating of bulk or interface recombination in the devices but also determine which interface is more defective. The detailed and stepwise guidance for such a type of light intensity analysis of JV parameters is provided. The proposed method and the conclusions of this study are supported by a series of case studies, showing the effectiveness of the proposed method on real examples.

         <title>Elaborate Size&#8208;tuning of Silica Aerogel Building Blocks Enables Laser&#8208;driven Lighting</title>

Abstract
Aerogels, a fascinating three&#8208;dimensional (3D) network structure composed of nano&#8208;scale building blocks as well as plenty of air in between these building blocks, have been applied in many emerging fields such as optics, energy, environment, aerospace, etc., yet a severe challenge remains in size&#8208;tuning of aerogel building blocks for particular optical applications (e.g., illumination). In this work, silica aerogels with accurate building block control were realized by adjusting surfactant concentration during synthetic process. The resulting silica aerogel monolith with spheric building blocks of ca. 24 &#8211; 40&#160;nm, together with a deliberately created hole along the incident light direction, shows an incredibly promising application in monochromatic laser&#8208;driven lighting. The resulting coefficient of illuminance variation (CIV) is as low as 8.1%, significantly outperforms commercially available ground glass diffuser (139.0%) and polymer diffuser (249.1%), the speckle contrast is lower, as well as better, than that can be recognized by the human eye (4%), and the illuminance uniformity in the range of 0.770&#8211;0.862 is much better (higher) than that indoor workplace lighting required by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The lighting with any colors in the visible spectrum including white could be obtained by using three primary color lasers (450, 532, and 638&#160;nm) with different powers simultaneously as the light source. The resulting silica aerogel with excellent thermal stability, high laser damage threshold, outstanding mechanical performance and super&#8208;hydrophobicity can be further applied to long&#8208;distance and non&#8208;contact laser&#8208;driven lighting in rain or under the water without any additional encapsulation components. Such laser&#8208;driven lighting was enabled for the&#160;first&#160;time by using silica aerogel as the diffuser, which not only broadens the application of various aerogel, but also promote lasers as a new generation of light sources.

         <title>Giant Thermal Transport Tuning at a Metal/ferroelectric Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Interfacial thermal transport plays a prominent role in the thermal management of nanoscale objects and is of fundamental importance for basic research and nanodevices.[1] At metal/insulator interfaces, a configuration commonly found in electronic devices, heat transport strongly depends upon the effective energy transfer from thermalized electrons in the metal to the phonons in the insulator. However, the mechanism of interfacial electron&#8208;phonon coupling and thermal transport at metal/insulator interfaces is not well understood. Here, we report the observation of a substantial enhancement of the interfacial thermal resistance and the important role of surface charges at the metal/ferroelectric interface in an Al/BiFeO3 membrane. By applying uniaxial strain, the interfacial thermal resistance can be varied substantially (up to an order of magnitude), which is attributed to the renormalized interfacial electron&#8208;phonon coupling caused by the charge redistribution at the interface due the polarization rotation. These results imply that surface charges at a metal/insulator interface can substantially enhance the interfacial electron&#8208;phonon&#8208;mediated thermal coupling, providing a new route to optimize the thermal transport performance in the next generation nanodevices, power electronics and thermal logic devices.

         <title>High&#8208;performance tin&#8208;lead mixed perovskite solar cells with vertical compositional gradient</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sn&#8208;Pb mixed perovskites with bandgaps in the range of 1.1&#8722;1.4&#160;eV are ideal candidates for single&#8208;junction solar cells to approach the Shockley&#8208;Queisser limit. However, the efficiency and stability of Sn&#8208;Pb mixed perovskite solar cells (PSC) still lag far behind those of Pb&#8208;based counterparts due to the easy oxidation of Sn2+. Here, a reducing agent 4&#8208;hydrazinobenzoic acid (HBA) is introduced as an additive along with SnF2 to suppress the oxidation of Sn2+. Meanwhile, vertical Pb/Sn compositional gradient is formed spontaneously after an antisolvent treatment due to different solubility and crystallization kinetics of Sn and Pb&#8208;based perovskites and can be finely tuned by controlling the antisolvent temperature. Because the band structure of a perovskite is dependent on its composition, graded vertical heterojunctions are constructed in the perovskite films with compositional gradient, which can enhance photocarrier separation and suppress carrier recombination in resultant PSCs. Under optimal fabrication conditions, the Sn&#8208;Pb mixed PSCs show power conversion efficiency up to 22% along with excellent stability during light soaking.

         <title>Perovskite&#8208;type SrVO3 as high&#8208;performance anode materials for Lithium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Perovskite&#8208;type oxides, characterized by excellent multifunctional physical and chemical properties, have been widely used in ferroelectric, piezoelectric, energy conversion, and storage applications. We show here that the perovskite&#8208;type SrVO3 can achieve excellent electrochemical performance as lithium&#8208;ion battery anodes thanks to its high electrically and ionically conductivity. Conducting additive&#8208;free SrVO3 electrodes can deliver a high specific capacity of 324 mAh g&#8722;1 at a safe and low average working potential of &#8764;0.9 V versus Li/Li+ together with excellent high&#8208;rate performance. A high areal capacity of &#8764;5.4 mAh cm&#8722;2 is obtained using an ultrathick (&#8764;120 um) electrode. Moreover, the fully lithiated SrVO3 electrode exhibits only 2.3% volume expansion that is explained by a simple solid solution Li+ storage mechanism, resulting in good cycling stability of the electrode. This study highlights the perovskite&#8208;type SrVO3 as a promising Li+ storage anode and provides opportunities for exploring a variety of perovskite oxides as next&#8208;generation metal&#8208;ion battery anodes.

         <title>Conjugated polymer mesocrystals with structural and optoelectronic coherence and anisotropy in three dimensions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We demonstrate semiconducting mesocrystalline bulk polymer specimens exhibiting near intrinsic properties using channel&#8208;die pressing. Predominant edge&#8208;on orientation is obtained for poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diyl), P3HT, throughout 2&#8208;mm&#8208;thick/wide samples. This persistent mesocrystalline arrangement at macroscopic scales allows reliable evaluation of the electronic charge transport anisotropy predicted along all three crystallographic axes, with high mobilities found along the &#960;&#8208;stacking versus the backbone direction. Indeed, charge&#8208;carrier mobilities of up to 2.3 cm2&#183; V&#8211;1&#183;s&#8211;1 are measured along the &#960;&#8208;stack, which are some of the highest mobilities found to date for conjugated polymers at low charge&#8208;carrier densities (drop&#8208;cast films display mobilities of maximum &#8776;10&#8211;3 cm2&#183;V&#8211;1&#183;s&#8211;1). The structural coherence also leads to an unusually well&#8208;defined photoluminescence line&#8208;shape characteristic of an H&#8208;aggregate (measured from the (001) surface, i.e., the surface perpendicular to the materials flow direction), rather than the typical HJ&#8208;aggregate feature usually found in P3HT films.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate semiconducting mesocrystalline bulk polymer specimens exhibiting near intrinsic properties using channel-die pressing. Predominant edge-on orientation is obtained for poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl), P3HT, &lt;i&gt;throughout&lt;/i&gt; 2-mm-thick/wide samples. This persistent mesocrystalline arrangement at macroscopic scales allows reliable evaluation of the electronic charge transport anisotropy predicted along all three crystallographic axes, with high mobilities found along the &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-stacking versus the backbone direction. Indeed, charge-carrier mobilities of up to 2.3 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#183; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; are measured along the &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-stack, which are some of the highest mobilities found to date for conjugated polymers at &lt;i&gt;low&lt;/i&gt; charge-carrier densities (drop-cast films display mobilities of maximum &#8776;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;3&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;). The structural coherence also leads to an unusually well-defined photoluminescence line-shape characteristic of an H-aggregate (measured from the (001) surface, i.e., the surface perpendicular to the materials flow direction), rather than the typical HJ-aggregate feature usually found in P3HT films. Our approach is widely applicable: to electrical conductors and materials used in &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-type devices, such as poly{[N,N&#8217;-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5&#8217;-(2,2&#8217;-bithiophene)}, N2200, where the mesocrystalline structure leads to high electron transport along the polymer backbones (&#8776;1.3 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

         <title>A Versatile Preparation of Mesoporous Single Layered Transition Metal Sulfide/Carbon Composites for Enhanced Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Transition metal sulfides are promise electrochemical energy storage materials due to their abundant active sites, large inter&#8208;layer space and high theoretical capacities. Especially for sodium storage. However, the low conductivity and poor cycling stability at high current densities hampered their applications. Herein, we report a versatile dual&#8208;templates method to elaborate ordered mesoporous single layered MoS2/carbon composite with high specific area, uniform pore size and large pore volume. The single layered MoS2 is confined in the carbon matrix. The mesopores between the composite nanorods provide fast electrolyte diffusion. The obtained nanocomposite shows a high sodium storage capability, excellent rate capacity, and very good cycling performance. A 310 mAh g&#8722;1 capacity can remains at 5.0 A g&#8722;1 after 2500 cycles. Furthermore, a SIB full cell composed the MoS2/carbon composite anode and a Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode maintains a specific capacity of 330&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 1.0 A g&#8722;1 during 100 cycles. The mechanism is investigated by in situ and ex situ characterizations as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Extracellular Matrix in Synthetic Hydrogel&#8208;based Prostate Cancer Organoids Regulate Therapeutic Response to EZH2 and DRD2 inhibitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Following treatment with androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibitors, &#8764;20% of prostate cancer patients progress by shedding their AR dependence. These tumors undergo epigenetic reprogramming turning castration&#8208;resistant prostate cancer adenocarcinoma (CRPC&#8208;Adeno) into neuroendocrine prostate cancer (CRPC&#8208;NEPC). Currently, no targeted therapies are available for CRPC&#8208;NEPCs, and there are minimal organoid models to discover new therapeutic targets against these aggressive tumors. Here, using a combination of patient tumor proteomics, RNA sequencing, spatial omics, immunohistochemistry, and a synthetic hydrogel&#8208;based organoid, we define putative extracellular matrix (ECM) cues that regulate the phenotypic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic underpinnings of CRPC&#8208;NEPCs. Short&#8208;term culture in tumor&#8208;expressed ECM differentially regulated DNA methylation and mobilized genes in CRPC&#8208;NEPC tumors. The ECM type distinctly regulated the response to small molecule inhibitors of epigenetic repressor EZH2 and Dopamine Receptor D2 (DRD2), the latter being an understudied target in neuroendocrine tumors. In vivo patient&#8208;derived xenograft studies in immunocompromised mice showed a robust anti&#8208;tumor response when treated with a DRD2 inhibitor. Finally, we demonstrate that therapeutic response in CRPC&#8208;NEPCs under drug&#8208;resistant ECM conditions can be overcome by first cellular reprogramming with EZH2 inhibitors, followed by DRD2 treatment. The synthetic hydrogel&#8208;based organoids suggest the regulatory role ECM may play in therapeutic response to targeted therapies in CRPC&#8208;NEPCs and enable the discovery of single drugs and combination therapies&#160;to overcome resistance.

         <title>Extreme Environmental Thermal Shock Induced Dislocation&#8208;Rich Pt Nanoparticles Boosting Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Crystal structure engineering of nanomaterials is crucial for the design of electrocatalysts. Inducing dislocations is an efficient approach to generate strain effects in nanomaterials to optimize the crystal and electronic structures and improve the catalytic properties. However, it is almost impossible to produce and retain dislocations in commercial mainstream catalysts, such as single metal platinum (Pt) catalysts. In this work, we report a nonequilibrium high&#8208;temperature (&gt; 1400 K) thermal shock method to induce rich dislocations in Pt nanocrystals (Dr&#8208;Pt). The method is performed in an extreme environment (&#8764;77 K) created by liquid nitrogen. The dislocations induced within milliseconds by thermal and structural stress during the crystallization process were kinetically frozen at an ultrafast cooling rate. The high&#8208;energy surface structures with dislocation&#8208;induced strain effects can prevent surface restructuring during catalysis. The findings indicate that our novel extreme environmental high&#8208;temperature thermal shock method can successfully introduce rich dislocations in Pt nanoparticles and significantly boost its hydrogen evolution reaction performance.

         <title>Dynamic and Self&#8208;adapting Interface Coating for Stable Zn Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Zinc (Zn) ion battery has attracted much attention due to its high safety and environmental protection. At present, the critical issue of the dendrites generation and the accumulation of dead Zn on the surface will lead to the sharp decline of battery life. Zn dendrites can be inhibited to some extent by constructing an interface protective coating. However, the existing rigid coating method cannot maintain conformal contact with Zn due to the volume change of Zn deposition and will cause fracture irreversibly during the cycle. Here, we developed a highly self&#8208;adaptable PDMS/TiO2&#8208;x coating that can dynamically adapt to volume changes and inhibit dendrites growth. PDMS has high dynamic and self&#8208;adaptability due to the crosslinking of the B&#8208;O bond. In addition, the rapid and uniform transfer of Zn2+ was induced by the oxygen&#8208;rich vacancy TiO2&#8208;x. The assembled cells still achieved 99.6% coulombic efficiency after 700 cycles at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2. The adaptive interface coating constructed provides a sufficient guarantee for the stable operation of the Zn anode.

However, because of the limited tolerance of chemical bonds against the lattice strains, it is challenging to maintain the crystallinity when the structure changes dramatically. Here we report a peculiar SCSC transformation from organic crystals to inorganic crystals, simultaneously achieving a drastic change in the structure, connectivity and dimension. As a demonstration, after reacting with liquid gallium, ZIF&#8208;8 can easily transform to two&#8208;dimensional hydroxide single crystals. Interestingly, long&#8208;range ordered metallic atoms of hydroxide inherited from the ordered atomic arrangement ZIF&#8208;8, but the connectivity is distinct. With good universality and extensibility, this transformation vastly expands the research scope of the SCSC transformations and provides a novel pathway for the synthesis of crystalline materials.

Abstract
Control of crystallography of thin metal electrodeposit films has recently emerged as key to achieving long operating lifetimes in next&#8208;generation electrochemical systems for energy storage. Very recent studies show that the crystallography of metal deposits impacts both morphological evolution and chemical kinetics of the interfaces between metal anodes and electrolytes in a battery. We report that the large crystallographic heterogeneity, e.g., broad orientational distribution, that appears characteristic of commercial metal foils results in rough morphology upon plating/stripping. On this basis, we develop an accumulative roll bonding (ARB) methodology&#8212;a severe plastic deformation process&#8212;that uses commercial metal foils as input. Zn metal&#8212;a promising, low&#8208;cost&#8208;competitive battery anode material&#8212; is used as a first example to interrogate the proposed concept. We demonstrate that the ARB process is highly effective in achieving uniform, mono&#8208;domain quality crystallographic control on macroscopic materials. After the ARB process, the Zn grains exhibit a strong (002) texture (i.e., [002]Zn//ND). We report further that the texture transitions from a classical bipolar pattern to a nonclassical unipolar pattern under large nominal strain, almost completely eliminating the orientational heterogeneity of the foil. Evaluated as anodes in aqueous Zn coin cells, the strongly (002)&#8208;textured Zn suppresses the rough plating/stripping landscape, promotes uniform, homoepitaxial growth of Zn and remarkably improve the continuous plating/stripping performance by nearly two orders of magnitude under practical conditions (e.g., 4 mAh at 40&#160;mA/cm2). The performance improvements are readily scaled to achieve pouch&#8208;type Zn full batteries that deliver exceptional reversibility. The ARB process is thermo&#8208;mechanical and can in principle be applied to any metal chemistry to achieve similar crystallographic uniformity, provided the appropriate temperature and accumulated strains are employed to achieve severe levels of plastic deformation. We evaluate this concept using ARB to induce strong texturing phenomena in commercial Li and Na foils, which unlike Zn (HCP) are BCC crystals, and demonstrate its success using morphological and electrochemical analysis of these metals as electrodes. Our simple process for creating strong textures in both hexagonal and cubic metals and illustrating the critical role such built&#8208;in crystallography plays underscores potentially transformative opportunities for developing scalable, highly reversible thin metal anodes (e.g., hexagonal Zn, Mg, and cubic Li, Na, Ca, Al) with specific crystal textures for next generation batteries that have practical N:P ratios.

         <title>Simultaneous Realization of Superoleophobicity and Strong Substrate Adhesion in Water via a Unique Segment Orientation Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The underwater superoleophobicity of a coating is often caused by its preferential water affinity, which however normally weakens the substrate adhesion property. In this work, we report a new strategy for achieving strong underwater adhesion between a well&#8208;designed amphiphilic polyurethane coating and a diverse range of substrates while also rendering the coating surface's superoleophobicity. When the coating, which is a mixture of an amphiphilic polyurethane and a water miscible solvent, is immersed in water, the hydrophobic segments aggregate to orientate and pile along the surface of substrates via a segment orientation mechanism triggered by solvent exchange with water penetration to exert strong adhesion. At the same time, the hydrophilic segments will physically crosslink to form a hydrogel coating, endowing the substrate with underwater superoleophobicity. This work provides a facile, versatile, and scalable approach for the future design of superoleophobic coatings in a water environment.

         <title>Designing a Zn&#8211;Ag Catalyst Matrix and Electrolyzer System for CO2 Conversion to CO and Beyond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalysts, electrodes, and membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) are developed for the electrocatalytic conversion of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO and beyond. The system consists of highly porous Ag dispersed in a Zn matrix, which leads to high CO2 utilization as described by multiphysics modeling. Coupling to microbiology allows for further upgrading to multicarbon products.








Abstract
CO2 emissions can be transformed into high&#8208;added&#8208;value commodities through CO2 electrocatalysis; however, efficient low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts are needed for global scale&#8208;up. Inspired by other emerging technologies, the authors report the development of a gas diffusion electrode containing highly dispersed Ag sites in a low&#8208;cost Zn matrix. This catalyst shows unprecedented Ag mass activity for CO production: &#8722;614&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 0.17&#160;mg&#160;of Ag. Subsequent electrolyte engineering demonstrates that halide anions can further improve stability and activity of the Zn&#8211;Ag catalyst, outperforming pure Ag and Au. Membrane electrode assemblies are constructed and coupled to a microbial process that converts the CO to acetate and ethanol. Combined, these concepts present pathways to design catalysts and systems for CO2 conversion toward sought&#8208;after products.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Metal&#8208;Enabled Mechanical&#8208;Energy&#8208;Induced CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With mechanical energy as the stimulus, CO2 is converted into solid carbon and O2 in a liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;based reaction system. Using the synergism of Ga nanodroplets and Ag&#8211;Ga nanorods, CO2 conversion proceeds through the triboelectrochemical reaction on Ga, while the Ag&#8211;Ga rods ensure the system's sustainability. This is achieved at a remarkably low energy consumption and high efficiency.








Abstract
A green carbon capture and conversion technology offering scalability and economic viability for mitigating CO2 emissions is reported. The technology uses suspensions of gallium liquid metal to reduce CO2 into carbonaceous solid products and O2 at near room temperature. The nonpolar nature of the liquid gallium interface allows the solid products to instantaneously exfoliate, hence keeping active sites accessible. The solid co&#8208;contributor of silver&#8211;gallium rods ensures a cyclic sustainable process. The overall process relies on mechanical energy as the input, which drives nano&#8208;dimensional triboelectrochemical reactions. When a gallium/silver fluoride mix at 7:1 mass ratio is employed to create the reaction material, 92% efficiency is obtained at a remarkably low input energy of 230 kWh (excluding the energy used for dissolving CO2) for the capture and conversion of a tonne of CO2. This green technology presents an economical solution for CO2 emissions.

The 3D geometrical model of the meniscus is attained using high&#8208;speed side&#8208;view and top&#8208;view in situ microscopy, within which a mathematical model for momentum and mass transport is developed. Utilizing 3D meniscus geometry, the underlying mechanism of dendritic growth of small molecule organic semiconductors is elucidated, which is widely applicable to various materials and coating systems.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;based thin&#8208;film solidification is a complex process involving various transport phenomena that are intricately dependent on multiple experimental parameters. The difficulty of analyzing this process experimentally or conducting exact numerical simulation make it challenging to understand, predict, and control the solidification process. In this work, a simple and effective technique to analyze the thin&#8208;film solidification process during solution shearing, based on 3D geometrical model of the meniscus, is proposed. The 3D meniscus geometry, which changes depending on the experimental parameters, is attained using high&#8208;speed side&#8208;view and top&#8208;view in situ microscopy. Thereafter, mass and momentum transport mathematical models are applied to obtain numerical solutions of transport phenomena within the meniscus. Utilizing these results, the underlying mechanism of dendritic growth of small molecule organic semiconductor is elucidated, which has previously been unknown. The 3D meniscus modeling is particularly important for this analysis, as dendrite formation is strongly dependent on the meniscus geometry near the contact line and mass transport variation perpendicular to the coating direction. This technique enables the study of complex relationship between experimental parameters and solidification process, which is widely applicable to various materials and coating systems; whereby, better understanding of thin&#8208;film growth and device performance optimization is possible.

         <title>3D Bioprinting of Cell&#8208;Laden Hydrogels for Improved Biological Functionality</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review describes recent progress and future opportunities to design dual&#8208;stage crosslinked bioinks, which are gels both prior to and after printing. These active, living materials are composed of both acellular and cellular components. Engineering hydrogels with consideration of cells as an intrinsic component of the printed bioink will enable greater biofunctionality.








Abstract
The encapsulation of cells within gel&#8208;phase materials to form bioinks offers distinct advantages for next&#8208;generation 3D bioprinting. 3D bioprinting has emerged as a promising tool for patterning cells, but the technology remains limited in its ability to produce biofunctional, tissue&#8208;like constructs due to a dearth of materials suitable for bioinks. While early demonstrations commonly used viscous polymers optimized for printability, these materials often lacked cell compatibility and biological functionality. In response, advanced materials that exist in the gel phase during the entire printing process are being developed, since hydrogels are uniquely positioned to both protect cells during extrusion and provide biological signals to embedded cells as the construct matures during culture. Here, an overview of the design considerations for gel&#8208;phase materials as bioinks is presented, with a focus on their mechanical, biochemical, and dynamic gel properties. Current challenges and opportunities that arise due to the fact that bioprinted constructs are active, living hydrogels composed of both acellular and cellular components are also evaluated. Engineering hydrogels with consideration of cells as an intrinsic component of the printed bioink will enable control over the evolution of the living construct after printing to achieve greater biofunctionality.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc Batteries Based on Organic/Organic Cathodes Integrating Multiredox Centers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoporous carbon (C) electrodeposited with stable poly(1,5&#8208;naphthalenediamine, NAPD) nanorods and excellent conductive poly(para&#8208;aminophenol, pAP) nanodots, designated as C@multi&#8208;layer polymer cathode, are first synthesized via a novel two&#8208;step electrodeposition method. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of C&#63742;O and C&#63742;N active groups, Zn//C@multi&#8208;layer polymer delivers high energy storage performances.








Abstract
Organic cathode materials with redox&#8208;active sites and flexible structure are promising for developing aqueous zinc ion batteries with high capacity and large output power. However, the energy storage of most organic hosts relies on the coordination/incoordination reaction between Zn2+/H+ and a single functional group, which result in inferior capacity, low discharge platform, and structural instability. Here, the lead is taken in in situ electrodepositing stable poly(1,5&#8208;naphthalenediamine, 1,5&#8208;NAPD) as interlayer and excellent conductive poly(para&#8208;aminophenol, pAP) skin onto nanoporous carbon in sequence for the structural optimization of organic/organic cathodes, designated as C@multi&#8208;layer polymer. In situ analyses, electrochemical measurements, and theoretical calculation prove that both C&#63742;O and C&#63742;N active groups can act as a strong electron donor as well as Zn2+ host during the discharging process. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the double organic layers, C@multi&#8208;layer polymer delivers high capacity, long lifespan, and excellent capacity reservation even at large discharge current and commercial mass loading (&gt;10&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). Introducing multiredox centers into one organic composites will provide new insights into designing advanced Zn&#8211;organic batteries.

         <title>Self&#8208;Complementary Zwitterionic Peptides Direct Nanoparticle Assembly and Enable Enzymatic Selection of Endocytic Pathways</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;activated assembly of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) using the zwitterionic peptide, LRGD, as a self&#8208;complementary, electrostatic binding moiety is illustrated. PEGylated peptide ligands containing the LRGD sequence are immobilized on the AuNPs. Cancer&#8208;specific enzymes, matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;9 (MMP&#8208;9), cleave the peptide ligands and subsequently unveil the LRGD moieties that promote multivalent, electrostatic interactions, leading to the assembly of the AuNPs.








Abstract
Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly in biological systems holds promise to convert and amplify disease&#8208;specific signals to physical or mechanical signals that can direct cell fate. However, it remains challenging to design physiologically stable self&#8208;assembling systems that demonstrate tunable and predictable behavior. Here, the use of zwitterionic tetrapeptide modalities to direct nanoparticle assembly under physiological conditions is reported. The self&#8208;assembly of gold nanoparticles can be activated by enzymatic unveiling of surface&#8208;bound zwitterionic tetrapeptides through matrix metalloprotease&#8208;9 (MMP&#8208;9), which is overexpressed by cancer cells. This robust nanoparticle assembly is achieved by multivalent, self&#8208;complementary interactions of the zwitterionic tetrapeptides. In cancer cells that overexpress MMP&#8208;9, the nanoparticle assembly process occurs near the cell membrane and causes size&#8208;induced selection of cellular uptake mechanism, resulting in diminished cell growth. The enzyme responsiveness, and therefore, indirectly, the uptake route of the system can be programmed by customizing the peptide sequence: a simple inversion of the two amino acids at the cleavage site completely inactivates the enzyme responsiveness, self&#8208;assembly, and consequently changes the endocytic pathway. This robust self&#8208;complementary, zwitterionic peptide design demonstrates the use of enzyme&#8208;activated electrostatic side&#8208;chain patterns as powerful and customizable peptide modalities to program nanoparticle self&#8208;assembly and alter cellular response in biological context.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Al, with the features of high specific capacity, low&#8208;cost, and abundant reserves, is promising for energy storage. The recent progress of Al anodes for various Al&#8208;based batteries is summarized. The challenges of Al anodes leading to a mismatch between theoretical and practical performance are discussed. Comprehensive strategies for Al anodes to boost the electrochemical performance are presented.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;growing market of electric vehicles and the upcoming grid&#8208;scale storage systems have stimulated the fast growth of renewable energy storage technologies. Aluminum&#8208;based batteries are considered one of the most promising alternatives to complement or possibly replace the current lithium&#8208;ion batteries owing to their high specific capacity, good safety, low cost, light weight, and abundant reserves of Al. However, the anode problems in primary and secondary Al batteries, such as, self&#8208;corrosion, passive film, and volume expansion, severely limit the batteries&#8217; practical performance, thus hindering their commercialization. Herein, an overview of the currently emerged Al&#8208;based batteries is provided, that primarily focus on the recent research progress for Al anodes in both primary and rechargeable systems. The anode reaction mechanisms and problems in various Al&#8208;based batteries are discussed, and various strategies to overcome the challenges of Al anodes, including surface oxidation, self&#8208;corrosion, volume expansion, and dendrite growth, are systematically summarized. Finally, future research perspectives toward advanced Al batteries with higher performance and better safety are presented.

         <title>Novel Materials for Urban Farming</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel materials are key to accelerate the development of technologies to improve the productivity and ensure the sustainability of urban farming. The novel material concepts help in improving seed treatment, alternative substrates, nutrients or pesticide delivery, environmental management, and plant health monitoring. This review highlights the current and potential research directions and challenges in these areas.








Abstract
Scarcity of natural resources, shifting demographics, climate change, and increasing waste are four major challenges in the quest to feed the exploding world population. These challenges serve as the impetus to harness novel technologies to improve agriculture, productivity, and sustainability. Urban farming has several advantages over conventional farming: higher productivity, improved sustainability, and the ability to provide fresh food all year round. Novel materials are key to accelerating the evolution of urban farming &#8211; with their ability to facilitate controlled release of nutrients and pesticides, improved seed health, substrates with better water retention capability, more efficient recycling of agricultural waste, and precise plant health monitoring. Materials science enables environmental sustainability and higher harvest yields in urban farms. Here, Singapore is used as an example of a land&#8208;scarce city where urban farming may be the solution for future food production. Potential research directions and challenges in urban farming are highlighted, and how material optimization and innovation drive the development of urban farming to meet national and global food demands is briefly discussed. This review serves as a guide for researchers and a reference for stakeholders of urban farms, policy makers, and other interested parties.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Mediated Twinning&#8208;Induced Plasticity in a Fine Hexagonal Microstructure Generated by Additive Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deformation twinning is one of the most effective mechanisms for improving the strength&#8211;ductility trade&#8208;off of structural alloys. However, its activation in hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) metals is reduced with decreasing grain size. This work reports the discovery of the activation of deformation twinning in a fine&#8208;grained hcp microstructure obtained by laser&#8208;based metal additive manufacturing.








Abstract
The grain size is a determinant microstructural feature to enable the activation of deformation twinning in hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) metals. Although deformation twinning is one of the most effective mechanisms for improving the strength&#8211;ductility trade&#8208;off of structural alloys, its activation is reduced with decreasing grain size. This work reports the discovery of the activation of deformation twinning in a fine&#8208;grained hcp microstructure by introducing ductile body&#8208;centered cubic (bcc) nano&#8208;layer interfaces. The fast solidification and cooling conditions of laser&#8208;based additive manufacturing are exploited to obtain a fine microstructure that, coupled with an intensified intrinsic heat treatment, permits to generate the bcc nano&#8208;layers. In situ high&#8208;energy synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction allows tracking the activation and evolution of mechanical twinning in real&#8208;time. The findings obtained show the potential of ductile nano&#8208;layering for the novel design of hcp damage tolerant materials with improved life spans.

         <title>Advancing 2D Perovskites for Efficient and Stable Solar Cells: Challenges and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solar cells incorporating 2D perovskites show tradeoffs between efficiency and stability. The challenges these solar cells face are identified and select works the community has undertaken to overcome them are highlighted in this review. Several recommendations are proposed on how to further improve perovskite solar cells so their performance and stability can be commensurate with application requirements.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly emerged as one of the hottest topics in the photovoltaics community owing to their high power&#8208;conversion efficiencies (PCE), and the promise to be produced at low cost. Among various PSCs, typical 3D perovskite&#8208;based solar cells deliver high PCE but they suffer from severe instability, which restricts their practical applications. In contrast to 3D perovskites, 2D perovskites that incorporate larger, less volatile, and generally more hydrophobic organic cations exhibit much improved thermal, chemical, and environmental stability. 2D perovskites can have different roles within a solar cell, either as the primary light absorber (2D PSCs), or as a capping layer atop a 3D perovskite absorbing layer (2D/3D PSCs). Tradeoffs between PCE and stability exist in both types of PSCs&#8212;2D PSCs are more stable but exhibit lower efficiency while 2D/3D PSCs deliver exciting efficiency but show relatively poor stability. To address this PCE/stability tradeoff, the challenges both the 2D and 2D/3D PSCs face are identified and select works the community has undertaken to overcome them are highlighted in this review. It is ended with several recommendations on how to further improve PSCs so their performance and stability can be commensurate with application requirements.

         <title>Slip&#8208;Stacked J&#8208;Aggregate Materials for Organic Solar Cells and Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
J&#8208; and H&#8208;aggregates constitute archetype functional materials due to unique properties originating from exciton coupling. Here, a broader perspective on the origin of red&#8208;shifted absorption bands including intermolecular charge transfer&#8208;mediated J&#8208;coupling is provided. Further, important classes of dye aggregates with regard to the prevailing intermolecular couplings and their relevance for organic solar cells and photodetectors are analyzed.








Abstract
Dye&#8211;dye interactions affect the optical and electronic properties in organic semiconductor films of light harvesting and detecting optoelectronic applications. This review elaborates how to tailor these properties of organic semiconductors for organic solar cells (OSCs) and organic photodiodes (OPDs). While these devices rely on similar materials, the demands for their optical properties are rather different, the former requiring a broad absorption spectrum spanning from the UV over visible up to the near&#8208;infrared region and the latter an ultra&#8208;narrow absorption spectrum at a specific, targeted wavelength. In order to design organic semiconductors satisfying these demands, fundamental insights on the relationship of optical properties are provided depending on molecular packing arrangement and the resultant electronic coupling thereof. Based on recent advancements in the theoretical understanding of intermolecular interactions between slip&#8208;stacked dyes, distinguishing classical J&#8208;aggregates with predominant long&#8208;range Coulomb coupling from charge transfer (CT)&#8208;mediated or &#8208;coupled J&#8208;aggregates, whose red&#8208;shifts are primarily governed by short&#8208;range orbital interactions, is suggested. Within this framework, the relationship between aggregate structure and functional properties of representative classes of dye aggregates is analyzed for the most advanced OSCs and wavelength&#8208;selective OPDs, providing important insights into the rational design of thin&#8208;film optoelectronic materials.

         <dc:description>
The combination of topology and magnetic order can lead to new quantum states and exotic physical effects. An overview of proximity&#8208;coupled magnetic topological insulator heterostructures, involving modulation doping, magnetic insulators, antiferromagnets, and rare&#8208;earth dopants, is given. They form a platform for exploring emergent phenomena such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect, real&#8208;space topological spin textures, and interfacial exchange coupling.








Abstract
Topological insulators (TIs) provide intriguing prospects for the future of spintronics due to their large spin&#8211;orbit coupling and dissipationless, counter&#8208;propagating conduction channels in the surface state. The combination of topological properties and magnetic order can lead to new quantum states including the quantum anomalous Hall effect that was&#160;first experimentally realized in Cr&#8208;doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 films. Since magnetic doping can introduce detrimental effects, requiring very low operational temperatures, alternative approaches are explored. Proximity coupling to magnetically ordered systems is an obvious option, with the prospect to raise the temperature for observing the various quantum effects. Here, an overview of proximity coupling and interfacial effects in TI heterostructures is presented, which provides a versatile materials platform for tuning the magnetic and topological properties of these exciting materials. An introduction is first given to the heterostructure growth by molecular beam epitaxy and suitable structural, electronic, and magnetic characterization techniques. Going beyond transition&#8208;metal&#8208;doped and undoped TI heterostructures, examples of heterostructures are discussed, including rare&#8208;earth&#8208;doped TIs, magnetic insulators, and antiferromagnets, which lead to exotic phenomena such as skyrmions and exchange bias. Finally, an outlook on novel heterostructures such as intrinsic magnetic TIs and systems including 2D materials is&#160;given.

         <title>Substantial P&#8208;Type Conductivity of AlN Achieved via Beryllium Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 42, October 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;modulated epitaxy (MME)&#8208;grown Be&#8208;doped AlN shows substantial first&#8208;time experimental p&#8208;type conductivity with hole concentrations in the range of 2.3 &#215; 1015 to 3.1 &#215; 1018&#160;cm&#8722;3&#160;at room temperature. The acceptor activation energy is found to be &#8776;37 meV, &#8776;8 times lower than predicted in the literature but on par with MME p&#8208;type GaN. A p&#8208;AlN:Be/i&#8208;GaN:Be/n&#8208;GaN:Ge diode is demonstrated with substantial rectification.








Abstract
Beryllium has long been predicted by first principle theory as the best p&#8208;type dopant for GaN and AlN. But experimental validation of these theories has not, until now, borne out the original predictions. A key challenge is the dopant&#8208;induced strain leading to Be rejection from substitutional sites in favor of interstitial sites, leading to self&#8208;compensation. More flexible growth methods like metal modulated epitaxy (MME) that can operate at substantially lower temperatures than traditional approaches, can more effectively place Be into the proper substitutional lattice sites. MME grown Be&#8208;doped AlN shows substantial p&#8208;type conductivity with hole concentrations in the range of 2.3 &#215; 1015&#8211;3.1 &#215; 1018&#160;cm&#8722;3&#160;at room temperature. While others have achieved sizable carrier concentrations near surfaces via carbon doping or Si implantation, this is the only known demonstration of substantial bulk p&#8208;type doping in AlN and is a nearly 1000 times higher carrier concentration than the best previously demonstrated bulk electron concentrations in AlN. The acceptor activation energy is found to be &#8776;37 meV, &#8776;8 times lower than predicted in literature but on par with similar results for MME p&#8208;type GaN. Preliminary results suggest that the films are highly compensated. A p&#8208;AlN:Be/i&#8208;GaN:Be/n&#8208;GaN:Ge pin diode is demonstrated with substantial rectification.

         <title>From Molecules to Frameworks to Superframework Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 42, October 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic approach is presented to build macroscopic structures with the same precision applied in molecular chemistry. Molecules are linked into frameworks, and crystals of frameworks are in turn linked into superframeworks, an escalation of building blocks from molecules to crystals. This strategy is termed augmented reticular chemistry, from where new frontiers of photonics, dynamics, and systems chemistry emerge.








Abstract
Building chemical structures of complexity and functionality approaching the level of biological systems is an ongoing challenge. A general synthetic strategy is proposed by which progressive levels of complexity are achieved through the building block approach whereby molecularly defined constructs at one level serve as constituent units of the next level, all being linked through strong bonds&#8212;&#8221;augmented reticular chemistry&#8221;. Specifically, current knowledge of linking metal complexes and organic molecules into reticular frameworks is applied here to linking the crystals of these frameworks into supercrystals (superframeworks). This strategy allows for the molecular control exercised on the molecular regime to be translated into higher augmentation levels to produce systems capable of dynamics and complex functionality far exceeding current materials.

         <title>Entropy Landscaping of High&#8208;Entropy Carbides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 42, October 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy carbides are designed based on valence electron concentration (VEC). VEC describes entropy, enthalpy, free energy, volume, and metastability of high entropy carbides such that a new composition thermodynamic property can be explained based on VEC.








Abstract
The entropy landscape of high&#8208;entropy carbides can be used to understand and predict their structure, properties, and stability. Using first principles calculations, the individual and temperature&#8208;dependent contributions of vibrational, electronic, and configurational entropies are analyzed, and compare them qualitatively to the enthalpies of mixing. As an experimental complement, high&#8208;entropy carbide thin films are synthesized with high power impulse magnetron sputtering to assess structure and properties. All compositions can be stabilized in the single&#8208;phase state despite finite positive, and in some cases substantial, enthalpies of mixing. Density functional theory calculations reveal that configurational entropy dominates the free energy landscape and compensates for the enthalpic penalty, whereas the vibrational and electronic entropies offer negligible contributions. The calculations predict that in many compositions, the single&#8208;phase state becomes stable at extremely high temperatures (&gt;3000 K). Consequently, rapid quenching rates are needed to preserve solubility at room temperature and facilitate physical characterization. Physical vapor deposition provides this experimental validation opportunity. The computation/experimental data set generated in this work identifies &#8220;valence electron concentration&#8221; as an effective descriptor to predict structural and thermodynamic properties of multicomponent carbides and educate new formulation selections.

         <title>Ultrahigh Energy Storage Performance of Layered Polymer Nanocomposites over a Broad Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 42, October 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layer&#8208;structured polymer nanocomposites exhibit remarkable capacitive energy storage performance, including high energy density, great charge&#8211;discharge efficiency, low driving field, and excellent dielectric stability at high electric fields and elevated temperatures. This work enables the rational design of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density dielectric polymer composites with a wide working temperature range.








Abstract
To reach the full potential of polymer dielectrics in advanced electronics and electrified transportation, it calls for efficient operation of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density dielectric polymers under high voltages over a wide temperature range. Here, the polymer composites consisting of the boron nitride nanosheet/polyetherimide and TiO2 nanorod arrays/polyetherimide layers are reported. The layered composite exhibits a much higher dielectric constant than the current high&#8208;temperature dielectric polymers and composites, while simultaneously retaining low dielectric loss at elevated temperatures and high applied fields. Consequently, the layered polymer composite presents much improved capacitive performance than the current dielectric polymers and composites over a temperature range of 25&#8211;150&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, the excellent capacitive performance of the layered composite is achieved at an applied field that is about 40% lower than the typical field strength of the current polymer composites with the discharged energy densities of &gt;3 J cm&#8722;3 at 150&#160;&#176;C. Remarkable cyclability and dielectric stability are established in the layered polymer nanocomposites. This work addresses the current challenge in the enhancement of the energy densities of high&#8208;temperature dielectric polymers and demonstrates an efficient route to dielectric polymeric materials with high energy densities and low loss over a broad temperature range.

         <title>Nanoporous NiSb to Enhance Nitrogen Electroreduction via Tailoring Competitive Adsorption Sites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 42, October 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolating nitrogen and proton adsorption sites is an efficient strategy to improve the catalytic performance for electrochemical nitrogen reduction. Nanoporous NiSb provides separated binding sites for adsorption of H+ and N2, and optimizes the adsorption of nitrogen reduction reaction intermediates due to the electrons modulation of Sb to Ni, resulting in the improved NH3 yield and Faradaic efficiency.








Abstract
Ambient nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is attracting extensive interest but still suffers from sluggish kinetics owing to competitive rapid hydrogen evolution and difficult nitrogen activation. Herein, nanoporous NiSb alloy is reported as an efficient electrocatalyst for N2 fixation, achieving a high ammonia yield rate of 56.9 &#181;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 with a Faradaic efficiency of 48.0%. Density functional theory calculations reveal that in NiSb alloy, Ni favors N2 hydrogenation while the neighboring Sb separates active sites for proton and N2 adsorption, which optimizes the adsorption/desorption of intermediates and enables an energetically favorable NRR pathway. This work indicates promising electrocatalytic application of the alloys of 3d and p block metals toward the NRR and provides an intriguing strategy to enhance the reduction of inert molecules by restraining the competitive hydrogen adsorption.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Polymerization of In&#8208;Plane Highly Ordered Carbon Nitride Nanosheets toward Photocatalytic Mineralization of Mercaptan Gas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 42, October 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In&#8208;plane highly ordered carbon nitride nanosheets with low structural defects synthesized by on&#8208;surface polymerization are endowed with strong sulfation&#8208;resistant ability and good reusability for complete photocatalytic mineralization of mercaptans. This study highlights the on&#8208;surface polymerization technique which opens up the prospect of the construction of an atomically controlled nanostructure with potentially advantageous properties that cannot otherwise be synthesized.








Abstract
2D carbon nitride nanosheets have attracted ever&#8208;increasing interest in photocatalysis due to their unique structural advantages. However, the nanosheets synthesized by the traditional methods, such as post oxidation and liquid exfoliation, have suffered from in&#8208;plane disorder with abundant structural defects, which seriously counteracts their structural benefits for photocatalysis. Herein, it is demonstrated that polymer carbon nitride nanosheets with in&#8208;plane highly ordered structure (PCNNs&#8208;IHO) can be successfully prepared by on&#8208;surface polymerization of melamine on NaCl crystal surface at elevated temperatures. The NaCl crystals with relative high surface energy not only facilitate the adsorption and activation of melamine to undergo condensation reaction, but also function as unique substrates to orientate the assembly of 2D nanosheet structure. In addition, NaCl also acts as a reactant to provide Na+ doping into carbon nitride matrix, affording PCNNs&#8208;IHO with robust structural base sites. Benefiting from this structural basicity, PCNNs&#8208;IHO exhibits superior photocatalytic performance toward CH3SH mineralization under visible light irradiation.

         <title>Lithium Fluoride in Electrolyte for Stable and Safe Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 42, October 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrolyte engineering via fluorinated additives is promising to improve the cycling stability and safety of high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;metal batteries. The electrolyte in an active porous LiF nanobox involves the formation of a high&#8208;fluorine&#8208;content (&gt;30%) solid electrolyte interphase layer to achieve a &#8776;3.5 Ah Li || LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cell with a specific energy of 380 Wh kg&#8722;1 under a practical carbonate electrolyte.








Abstract
Electrolyte engineering via fluorinated additives is promising to improve cycling stability and safety of high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;metal batteries. Here, an electrolyte is reported in a porous lithium fluoride (LiF) strategy to enable efficient carbonate electrolyte engineering for stable and safe Li&#8208;metal batteries. Unlike traditionally engineered electrolytes, the prepared electrolyte in the porous LiF nanobox exhibits nonflammability and high electrochemical performance owing to strong interactions between the electrolyte solvent molecules and numerous exposed active LiF (111) crystal planes. Via cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy depth analysis, it is revealed that the electrolyte in active porous LiF nanobox involves the formation of a high&#8208;fluorine&#8208;content (&gt;30%) solid electrolyte interphase layer, which enables very stable Li&#8208;metal anode cycling over one thousand cycles under high current density (4 mA cm&#8722;2). More importantly, employing the porous LiF nanobox engineered electrolyte, a Li || LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cell is achieved with a specific energy of 380 Wh kg&#8722;1 for stable cycling over 80 cycles, representing the excellent performance of the Li&#8208;metal pouch cell using practical carbonate electrolyte. This study provides a new electrolyte engineering strategy for stable and safe Li&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Uncovering the Promotion of CeO2/CoS1.97 Heterostructure with Specific Spatial Architectures on Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 42, October 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel CeO2/CoS1.97 heterostructure electrocatalysts (CeO2&#8208;CoS1.97 and CoS1.97&#8208;CeO2) are constructed to investigate the relationships between spatial architectures and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances, where different configuration endows hybrids with distinct intermediate adsorption, modulated electronic structures, and promoted electrochemical reconstruction, thus improving the OER kinetics and performances. This work sheds light on the importance of rational design and synthesis of advanced hybrid electrocatalysts with functional spatial architectures.








Abstract
Structural engineering and compositional controlling are extensively applied in rationally designing and fabricating advanced freestanding electrocatalysts. The key relationship between the spatial distribution of components and enhanced electrocatalysis performance still needs further elaborate elucidation. Here, CeO2 substrate supported CoS1.97 (CeO2&#8208;CoS1.97) and CoS1.97 with CeO2 surface decorated (CoS1.97&#8208;CeO2) materials are constructed to comprehensively investigate the origin of spatial architectures for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). CeO2&#8208;CoS1.97 exhibits a low overpotential of 264&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 due to the stable heterostructure and faster mass transfer. Meanwhile, CoS1.97&#8208;CeO2 has a smaller Tafel slope of 49&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1 through enhanced adsorption of OH&#8722;, fast electron transfer, and in situ formation of Co(IV)O2 species under the OER condition. Furthermore, operando spectroscopic characterizations combined with theoretical calculations demonstrate that spatial architectures play a distinguished role in modulating the electronic structure and promoting the reconstruction from sulfide to oxyhydroxide toward higher chemical valence. The findings highlight spatial architectures and surface reconstruction in designing advanced electrocatalytic materials.

         <title>Controlling Liquid Crystal Orientations for Programmable Anisotropic Transformations in Cellular Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 42, October 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cellular microstructures are fabricated out of liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) with an arbitrary, user&#8208;defined liquid crystal (LC) mesogen orientation encrypted by a weak magnetic field. This platform enables anisotropy to be programmed independently at the molecular and structural levels and the realization of unprecedented director&#8208;determined symmetry breakings, which can be exploited to achieve switchable and direction&#8208;dependent frictional properties as well as to modulate light.








Abstract
Geometric reconfigurations in cellular structures have recently been exploited to realize adaptive materials with applications in mechanics, optics, and electronics. However, the achievable symmetry breakings and corresponding types of deformation and related functionalities have remained rather limited, mostly due to the fact that the macroscopic geometry of the structures is generally co&#8208;aligned with the molecular anisotropy of the constituent material. To address this limitation, cellular microstructures are fabricated out of liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) with an arbitrary, user&#8208;defined liquid crystal (LC) mesogen orientation encrypted by a weak magnetic field. This platform enables anisotropy to be programmed independently at the molecular and structural levels and the realization of unprecedented director&#8208;determined symmetry breakings in cellular materials, which are demonstrated by both finite element analyses and experiments. It is illustrated that the resulting mechanical reconfigurations can be harnessed to program microcellular materials with switchable and direction&#8208;dependent frictional properties and further exploit &#8221;area&#8208;specific&#8221; deformation patterns to locally modulate transmitted light and precisely guide object movement. As such, the work provides a clear route to decouple anisotropy at the materials level from the directionality of the macroscopic cellular structure, which may lead to a new generation of smart and adaptive materials and&#160;devices.

         <title>Ultrathin PdAuBiTe Nanosheets as High&#8208;Performance Oxygen Reduction Catalysts for a Direct Methanol Fuel Cell Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 42, October 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin quaternary PdAuBiTe alloyed 2D&#160;nanosheets are first achieved by a new visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced template strategy. As high&#8208;performance oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts, the PdAuBiTe nanosheets can greatly increase power densities and durability in direct methanol fuel cell devices. The maximum power densities of PdAuBiTe nanosheets are up to 235.7/173.5&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8211;2 in O2/air, respectively.








Abstract
Ultrathin 2D metal nanostructures have sparked a lot of research interest because of their improved electrocatalytic properties for fuel cells. So far, no effective technique for preparing ultrathin 2D Pd&#8208;based metal nanostructures with more than three compositions has been published. Herein, a new visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced template technique for producing PdAuBiTe alloyed 2D ultrathin nanosheets is developed. The mass activity of the PdAuBiTe nanosheets against the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is 2.48 A mgPd&#8722;1, which is 27.5/17.7 times that of industrial Pd/C/Pt/C, respectively. After 10&#160;000 potential cyclings, there is no decrease in ORR activity. The PdAuBiTe nanosheets exhibit high methanol tolerance and in situ anti&#8208;CO poisoning properties. The PdAuBiTe nanosheets, as cathode electrocatalysts in direct methanol fuel cells, can thus give significant improvement in terms of power density and durability. In O2/air, the power density can be increased to 235.7/173.5&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2, higher than that reported in previous work, and which is 2.32/3.59 times higher than Pt/C.

         <title>Room Temperature Ferromagnetism of Monolayer Chromium Telluride with Perpendicular Magnetic Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 42, October 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism of monolayer Cr3Te4, which is not an inherently layered material, is reported. Molecular beam epitaxy allows the successful growth of 2D Cr3Te4 in the monolayer form on graphite at low substrate temperatures, e.g., &#8776;100 &#176;C, which is compatible with Si complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor technology.








Abstract
The realization of long&#8208;range magnetic ordering in 2D systems can potentially revolutionize next&#8208;generation information technology. Here, the successful fabrication of crystalline Cr3Te4 monolayers with room temperature (RT) ferromagnetism is reported. Using molecular beam epitaxy, the growth of 2D Cr3Te4 films with monolayer thickness is demonstrated at low substrate temperatures (&#8776;100 &#176;C), compatible with Si complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology. X&#8208;ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements reveal a Curie temperature (Tc) of v344 K for the Cr3Te4 monolayer with an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane magnetic easy axis, which decreases to v240 K for the thicker film (&#8776;7&#160;nm) with an in&#8208;plane easy axis. The enhancement of ferromagnetic coupling and the magnetic anisotropy transition is ascribed to interfacial effects, in particular the orbital overlap at the monolayer Cr3Te4/graphite interface, supported by density&#8208;functional theory calculations. This work sheds light on the low&#8208;temperature scalable growth of 2D nonlayered materials with RT ferromagnetism for new magnetic and spintronic devices.

         <title>Mn&#8208;Rich MnSb2Te4: A Topological Insulator with Magnetic Gap Closing at High Curie Temperatures of 45&#8211;50 K</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 42, October 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn&#8208;rich MnSb2Te4 is shown to exhibit ferromagnetic hysteresis with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane anisotropy and Curie temperature of 45&#8211;50 K. It is a topological insulator with Dirac point close to the Fermi level and a magnetic gap that closes at the Curie temperature. These favorable properties are caused by excess Mn that substitutes Sb within the septuple layers.








Abstract
Ferromagnetic topological insulators exhibit the quantum anomalous Hall effect, which is potentially useful for high&#8208;precision metrology, edge channel spintronics, and topological qubits. &#160;The stable 2+ state of Mn enables intrinsic magnetic topological insulators. MnBi2Te4 is, however, antiferromagnetic with 25 K N&#233;el temperature and is strongly n&#8208;doped. In this work, p&#8208;type MnSb2Te4, previously considered topologically trivial, is shown to be a ferromagnetic topological insulator for a few percent Mn excess. i) Ferromagnetic hysteresis with record Curie temperature of 45&#8211;50 K, ii) out&#8208;of&#8208;plane magnetic anisotropy, iii) a 2D Dirac cone with the Dirac point close to the Fermi level, iv) out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin polarization as revealed by photoelectron spectroscopy, and v) a magnetically induced bandgap closing at the Curie temperature, demonstrated by scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), are shown. Moreover, a critical exponent of the magnetization &#946;&#160;&#8776; 1 is found, indicating the vicinity of a quantum critical point. Ab initio calculations reveal that Mn&#8211;Sb site exchange provides the ferromagnetic interlayer coupling and the slight excess of Mn nearly doubles the Curie temperature. Remaining deviations from the ferromagnetic order open the inverted bulk bandgap and render MnSb2Te4 a robust topological insulator and new benchmark for magnetic topological insulators.

A novel organic upconversion device (UCD) based on interfacial exciplexes, which shows high conversion efficiency near 13%, low turn&#8208;on voltage (Von) down to 1.56 V, high imaging linear dynamic range (I&#8208;LDR) over 80 dB, and high luminance on/off ratio of up to 85&#160;000, is fabricated for high&#8208;performance near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light detection and noninvasive direct imaging.








Abstract
Infrared upconversion devices (UCDs) enable low&#8208;cost visualization of infrared optical signals without utilizing a readout circuit, which is of great significance for biological recognition and noninvasive dynamic monitoring. However, UCDs suffer from inferior photon to photon (p&#8211;p) efficiency and high turn&#8208;on voltage (Von) for upconversion operation, hindering a further expansion in highly resolved infrared imaging. Herein, an efficient organic UCD integrating an interfacial exciplex emitter and a well&#8208;designed near&#8208;infrared (NIR) detector reveals a high efficiency up to 12.92% and a low Von down to 1.56&#160;V. The low Von gives the capacity for detecting weak NIR light down to 3.2 &#181;W cm&#8211;2, significantly expanding the detection power scale of UCDs. Thus, the imaging linear dynamic range (I&#8208;LDR) is highly bias&#8208;tunable, ranging from 13.23 to 84.4&#160;dB. The high I&#8208;LDR enables highly resolved and strong&#8208;penetration bioimaging especially for thick biological sections, indicating great potential in noninvasive defect and pathological detection.

         <title>Bioinspired Functionally Graded Composite Assembled Using Cellulose Nanocrystals and Genetically Engineered Proteins with Controlled Biomineralization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 42, October 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Formulation of a graded multiphase nanocomposite that mimics key molecular and architectural features of the mantis shrimp dactyl club in the complex shape of dental implant crown, exhibiting high strength, stiffness, and toughness, is reported. The material consists of expanded helicoidally organized cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) mixed with genetically engineered proteins regulating both binding to CNCs and the growth of reinforcing apatite crystals.








Abstract
Nature provides unique insights into design strategies evolved by living organisms to construct robust materials with a combination of mechanical properties that are challenging to replicate synthetically. Hereby, inspired by the impact&#8208;resistant dactyl club of the stomatopod, a mineralized biocomposite is rationally designed and produced in the complex shapes of dental implant crowns exhibiting high strength, stiffness, and fracture toughness. This material consists of an expanded helicoidal organization of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) mixed with genetically engineered proteins that regulate both binding to CNCs and in situ growth of reinforcing apatite crystals. Critically, the structural properties emerge from controlled self&#8208;assembly across multiple length scales regulated by rational engineering and phase separation of the protein components. This work replicates multiscale biomanufacturing of a model biological material and also offers an innovative platform to synthesize multifunctional biocomposites whose properties can be finely regulated by colloidal self&#8208;assembly and engineering of its constitutive protein building blocks.

         <title>Charge Density Wave Orders and Enhanced Superconductivity under Pressure in the Kagome Metal CsV3Sb5</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 42, October 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
4a&#160;&#215; 1a and 2a&#160;&#215; 2a charge density wave (CDW) orders are observed in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5 single crystal. A dome&#8208;shaped phase diagram accompanying the suppression of CDW state reveals a complex landscape of electronic states that can co&#8208;exist on a kagome lattice and compete with superconductivity, offering a new platform to investigate the interplay between superconductivity, CDW, and nontrivial topological electronic structure.








Abstract
Superconductivity in topological kagome metals has recently received great research interests. Here, charge density wave (CDW) orders and the evolution of superconductivity under various pressures in CsV3Sb5 single crystal with V kagome lattice are investigated. By using high&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), two CDW orders in CsV3Sb5 are observed which correspond to 4a&#160;&#215; 1a and 2a&#160;&#215; 2a superlattices. By applying pressure, the superconducting transition temperature Tc is significantly enhanced and reaches a maximum value of 8.2 K at around 1&#160;GPa. Accordingly, CDW state is gradually declined as increasing the pressure, which indicates the competing interplay between CDW and superconducting state in this material. The broad superconducting transitions around 0.4&#8211;0.8&#160;GPa can be related to the strong competition relation among two CDW states and superconductivity. These results demonstrate that CsV3Sb5 is a new platform for exploring the interplay between superconductivity and CDW in topological kagome metals.

         <title>The Interfacial Electronic Engineering in Binary Sulfiphilic Cobalt Boride Heterostructure Nanosheets for Upgrading Energy Density and Longevity of Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 42, October 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A type of new heterostructure nanosheets composed of binary sulfiphilic cobalt boride (CoB) on nitrogen, boron&#8208;codoped porous carbon (NBC), is fabricated through a molten salt&#8208;assisted strategy using ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;encapsulated ZIF&#8208;8 as precursors. Strong interfacial electronic interactions between CoB and NBC endow the CoB/NBC&#8208;S electrode with high gravimetric/areal/volumetric capacities and long lifetime in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.








Abstract
High gravimetric, areal and volumetric capacities together with long lifetime are key indexes for the applications of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries in compact space. The sulfur host materials play pivotal roles in the practical deployment. Herein, one type of new heterostructure nanosheets composed of cobalt boride (CoB) on nitrogen, boron&#8208;codoped porous carbon (NBC), which is constructed through molten salt&#8208;assisted strategy using ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;encapsulated ZIF&#8208;8 as precursors is reported on. Benefiting from strong interfacial electronic interactions between binary sulfiphilic CoB and porous NBC, the CoB/NBC&#8208;S electrode exhibits the excellent cycling stability with low average capacity decay of 0.013% in ultralong 1500 cycles at high rate of 5 C. Remarkably, the electrode with high sulfur content of 82 wt% and high sulfur loading of 5.8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 delivers gravimetric capacity of 1309&#160;mA h g&#8722;1, areal capacity of 7.59&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2, and volumetric capacity of 1355&#160;mA h cm&#8722;3 at 0.1 C. The favorable electrochemical performance can rival with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of those in the reported nanosheets&#8208;based sulfur cathodes. This study provides new methodology for the design of heterostructure nanosheets of metal borides to achieve energy density and longevity of Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Amphiphilic Copolymers for Versatile, Facile, and In Situ Tunable Surface Biofunctionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 42, October 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
PEGylated styrene&#8211;maleic acid(anhydride) copolymers with systematically varied molecular architecture&#8212;anchor polymers&#8212;are introduced for the highly versatile adsorptive surface functionalization of materials. The water&#8208;soluble but highly surface affine copolymers can be equipped with a broad range of bioactive ligands introducing cell&#8208;instructive and antimicrobial surface properties.








Abstract
Precision surface engineering is key to advanced biomaterials. A new platform of PEGylated styrene&#8211;maleic acid copolymers for adsorptive surface biofunctionalization is reported. Balanced amphiphilicity renders the copolymers water&#8208;soluble but strongly affine for surfaces. Fine&#8208;tuning of their molecular architecture provides control over adsorptive anchorage onto specific materials&#8212;which is why they are referred to as &#8220;anchor polymers&#8221; (APs)&#8212;and over structural characteristics of the adsorbed layers. Conjugatable with an array of bioactives&#8212;including cytokine&#8208;complexing glycosaminoglycans, cell&#8208;adhesion&#8208;mediating peptides and antimicrobials&#8212;APs can be applied to customize materials for demanding biotechnologies in uniquely versatile, simple, and robust ways. Moreover, homo&#8208; and heterodisplacement of adsorbed APs provide unprecedented means of in situ alteration and renewal of the functionalized surfaces.

     alt="Amphiphilic Copolymers for Versatile, Facile, and In Situ Tunable Surface Biofunctionalization"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PEGylated styrene&#8211;maleic acid(anhydride) copolymers with systematically varied molecular architecture&#8212;anchor polymers&#8212;are introduced for the highly versatile adsorptive surface functionalization of materials. The water-soluble but highly surface affine copolymers can be equipped with a broad range of bioactive ligands introducing cell-instructive and antimicrobial surface properties.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precision surface engineering is key to advanced biomaterials. A new platform of PEGylated styrene&#8211;maleic acid copolymers for adsorptive surface biofunctionalization is reported. Balanced amphiphilicity renders the copolymers water-soluble but strongly affine for surfaces. Fine-tuning of their molecular architecture provides control over adsorptive anchorage onto specific materials&#8212;which is why they are referred to as &#8220;anchor polymers&#8221; (APs)&#8212;and over structural characteristics of the adsorbed layers. Conjugatable with an array of bioactives&#8212;including cytokine-complexing glycosaminoglycans, cell-adhesion-mediating peptides and antimicrobials&#8212;APs can be applied to customize materials for demanding biotechnologies in uniquely versatile, simple, and robust ways. Moreover, homo- and heterodisplacement of adsorbed APs provide unprecedented means of in situ alteration and renewal of the functionalized surfaces. The related options are exemplified with proof-of-concept experiments of controlled bacterial adhesion, human umbilical vein endothelial cell, and induced pluripotent cell growth on AP-functionalized surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Programmable Multistable Perforated Shellular</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 42, October 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Programmable multidirectional multistable shellular metamaterials are developed by adding perforations on the Schwarz Primitive surface, where introducing elliptical holes can lead to the motif's structural bistability, while n&#8208;layer staggered perforations contribute to a maximum of 2n&#8722;1 stable states. Independent three&#8208;directional multistable perforated shellulars are demonstrated using transformations of a staggered perforated motif along the three orthogonal coordinate directions.








Abstract
Developing bistable metamaterials has recently offered a new design paradigm for deployable structures and reusable dampers. While most bistable mechanisms possess inclined/curved struts, a new 3D multistable shellular metamaterial is developed by introducing delicate perforations on the surface of Schwarz's Primitive shellular, integrating the unique properties of shellular materials such as high surface area, stiffness, and energy absorption with the multistability concept. Denoting the fundamental snapping part by motif, certain shellular motifs with elliptical perforations exhibit mechanical bistability. To bring the concept of multistability to a single motif, multistable shellular motifs are developed by introducing multilayer staggered perforations that form hinges and facilitate local instability. Adopting an n&#8208;layer staggered perforation (n hinges) design leads to a maximum 2n&#8722;1 stable states within one shellular motif during loading and unloading. Three&#8208;directional multistable shellulars are attained by extending the perforation design in three orthogonal directions. Harnessing snap&#8208;through and snap&#8208;back behaviors and self&#8208;contact, the introduced multistable perforated shellulars exhibit strong rigidity both in loading and unloading, and enhanced energy dissipation. The introduced design strategy opens up new horizons for creating multidirectional multistable metamaterials with load bearing capabilities for applications in soft robotics, shape&#8208;morphing architectures, and reusable and deployable energy absorbers/dampers.

         <title>A Highly Robust Ionotronic Fiber with Unprecedented Mechanomodulation of Ionic Conduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 42, October 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly stretchable and robust ionotronic fiber comprising a liquid crystal elastomer network and an ionic liquid is reported. The soft chain spacers selectively anchor cations while rigid mesogens align in response to stretching leading to the formation of phase&#8208;separated low&#8208;tortuous anion&#8208;conducting nanochannels. Consequently, the ionic conductivity is unprecedentedly boosted with strain, which has never been observed in previously reported ionic conductors.








Abstract
Stretchable ionic conductors are appealing for tissue&#8208;like soft electronics, yet suffer from a tardy mechanoelectric response due to their poor modulation of ionic conduction arising from intrinsic homogeneous soft chain network. Here, a highly robust ionotronic fiber is designed by synergizing ionic liquid and liquid crystal elastomer with alternate rigid mesogen units and soft chain spacers, which shows an unprecedented strain&#8208;induced ionic conductivity boost (&#8776;103 times enhanced as stretched to 2000% strain). Such a surprisingly high enhancement is attributed to the formation of microphase&#8208;separated low&#8208;tortuosity ion&#8208;conducting nanochannels guided by strain&#8208;induced emergence of aligned smectic mesophases, thus allowing for ultrafast ion transport that resembles the role of &#8220;swimming lanes.&#8221; Intriguingly, the boosting conductivity even reverses Pouillet's Law&#8208;dictated resistance increase at certain strains, leading to unique waveform&#8208;discernible strain sensing. Moreover, the fiber retains thermal actuation properties with a maximum of 70% strain changes upon heating, and enables integrated self&#8208;perception and actuation. The findings offer a promising molecular engineering route to mechanically modulate the ion transport behavior of ionic conductors toward advanced ionotronic applications.

         <title>Quantifying Contact&#8208;Electrification Induced Charge Transfer on a Liquid Droplet after Contacting with a Liquid or Solid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 42, October 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An apparatus based on acoustic levitation is designed to measure the charge transfer at the solid&#8211;liquid and liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces, and the asymmetric transfer behavior of positive and negative charges at the oil&#8211;water interface is observed, suggesting that the electron transfer plays a dominant role in the contact electrification at liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces.








Abstract
Contact electrification (CE) is a common physical phenomenon, and its mechanisms for solid&#8211;solid and liquid&#8211;solid cases have been widely discussed. However, the studies about liquid&#8211;liquid CE are hindered by the lack of proper techniques. Here, a contactless method is proposed for quantifying the charges on a liquid droplet based on the combination of electric field and acoustic field. The liquid droplet is suspended in an acoustic field, and an electric field force is created on the droplet to balance the acoustic trap force. The amount of charges on the droplet is thus calculated based on the equilibrium of forces. Further, the liquid&#8211;solid and liquid&#8211;liquid CE are both studied by using the method, and the latter is focused. The behavior of negatively precharged liquid droplet in the liquid&#8211;liquid CE is found to be different from that of the positively precharged one. The results show that the silicone oil droplet prefers to receive negative charges from a negatively charged aqueous droplet rather than positive charges from a positively charged aqueous droplet, which provides a strong evidence about the dominant role played by electron transfer in the liquid&#8211;liquid CE.

         <title>A General Crosslinker Strategy to Realize Intrinsic Frozen Resistance of Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 42, October 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and universal crosslinking strategy to fabricate a family of EGINA&#8208;crosslinked materials with intrinsic, built&#8208;in antifreezing and mechanical properties, but without any antifreezing additives is demonstrated. The resultant EGINA&#8208;crosslinked materials, consisting of a wide range of compositions (hydrophiles, electrolytes, zwitterions, macromolecules), enable achievement of their antifreezing properties at &#8722;20 &#176;C in solution, gel state, and hydrogel/solid interfaces.








Abstract
Development and understanding of antifreezing materials are fundamentally and practically important for materials design and delivery. However, almost all of antifreezing materials are either organic/icephobic materials containing no water or hydrophilic hydrogels containing antifreezing additives. Here, a general crosslinking strategy to fabricate a family of EGINA&#8208;crosslinked double&#8208;network hydrogels with intrinsic, built&#8208;in antifreezing and mechanical properties, but without any antifreezing additives is proposed and demonstrated. The resultant hydrogels, despite large structural and compositional variations of hydrophilies, electrolytes, zwitterions, and macromolecules of polymer chains, achieved strong antifreezing and mechanical properties in different environments including solution state, gel state, and hydrogel/solid interfaces. Such general antifreezing property of EGINA&#8208;crosslinked hydrogels, regardless network compositions, is likely stemmed from their highly hydrophilic and tightly crosslinked DN structures for inducing strong water&#8211;network bindings to prevent ice crystal formation from free waters in hydrogel networks. EGINA&#8208;crosslinked hydrogels can also serve as a key component to be fabricated into smart windows with high optical transmittance and supercapacitors with excellent electrochemical stability at subzero temperatures. This work provides a simple, blueprint antifreezing design concept and a family of antifreezing hydrogels for the better understanding of the composite&#8211;structure&#8211;property relationship of antifreezing materials and the fundamentals of confined water in wet soft materials.

         <title>Randomly Induced Phase Transformation in Silk Protein&#8208;Based Microlaser Arrays for Anticounterfeiting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 42, October 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel physically unclonable cryptographic protocol from silk&#8208;protein&#8208;based microlaser arrays is proposed, where the randomness is introduced through randomly induced phase transformation of silk protein. The microlaser array possesses the deterministic readout sites of laser signals and unrepeatable signal distribution characteristics, which can guarantee efficient authentication and high security when serving as an anti&#8208;counterfeiting label.








Abstract
Anticounterfeiting labels based on physical unclonable functions (PUFs) exhibit high security with unreplicable code outputs, making them an ideal platform to realize unbreakable anticounterfeiting. Although various schemes are proposed for PUF labels, the utilization of natural randomness suffers from unpredictable signal extraction sites, which poses a challenge to efficient and convenient authentication for practical anticounterfeiting applications. Here, a covert optical PUF&#8208;based cryptographic protocol from silk protein&#8208;based microlaser (SML) arrays that possess hidden randomness of lasers for unclonable lasing signals as well as a defined location for efficient identification is proposed. The initial SMLs are patterned by casting laser dye&#8208;doped regenerated silk fibroin solution, resulting in a uniform microlaser array with regulated positions. With the SML array as substrate, random methanol microdroplets are stochastically sprayed on the SML array, which eventually induces uneven lasing signal changes of the patterned microlasers. The treated SML array possesses the deterministic readout sites of laser signals and unrepeatable signal distribution characteristics, which can guarantee efficient authentication and high security when serving as an anticounterfeiting label.

         <title>The Role of Additives in Suppressing the Degradation of Liquid&#8208;Exfoliated WS2 Monolayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 42, October 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The degradation of liquid&#8208;exfoliated WS2 monolayers is studied in situ through photoluminescence as function of time and temperature in two surfactant systems (sodium cholate&#8212;SC; sodium dodecyl sulfate&#8212;SDS). The kinetics reveal that a photoinduced degradation (activation energy &#8776;25 kJ mol&#8722;1) is dominant in SC, while an additional thermal degradation (activation energy &#8776;50 kJ mol&#8722;1) is observed in SDS.








Abstract
Group VI transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are considered to be chemically widely inert, but recent reports point toward an oxidation of monolayered sheets in ambient conditions, due to defects. To date, the degradation of monolayered TMDs is only studied on individual, substrate&#8208;supported nanosheets with varying defect type and concentration, strain, and in an inhomogeneous environment. Here, degradation kinetics of WS2 nanosheet ensembles in the liquid phase are investigated through photoluminescence measurements, which selectively probe the monolayers. Monolayer&#8208;enriched WS2 dispersions are produced with varying lateral sizes in the two common surfactant stabilizers sodium cholate (SC) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Well&#8208;defined degradation kinetics are observed, which enable the determination of activation energies of the degradation and decouple photoinduced and thermal degradation. The thermal degradation is slower than the photoinduced degradation and requires higher activation energy. Using SC as surfactant, it is sufficiently suppressed. The photoinduced degradation can be widely prevented through chemical passivation achieved through the addition of cysteine which, on the one hand, coordinates to defects on the nanosheets and, on the other hand, stabilizes oxides on the surface, which shield the nanosheets from further degradation.

         <title>3D Bioprinting of Engineered Tissue Flaps with Hierarchical Vessel Networks (VesselNet) for Direct Host&#8208;To&#8208;Implant Perfusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 42, October 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoscale tubular scaffolds and 3D bioprinted vascularized hydrogels are combined to create engineered hierarchically vascularized tissues (engineered flap) consisting of rich microvascular networks in communication with an engineered endothelium. The in vitro cultured flaps are directly anastomosed to the host vasculature, which perfuses the implanted tissue. The concept is expanded by 3D printing patient&#8208;specific vascular constructs with complex native architectures.








Abstract
Engineering hierarchical vasculatures is critical for creating implantable functional thick tissues. Current approaches focus on fabricating mesoscale vessels for implantation or hierarchical microvascular in vitro models, but a combined approach is yet to be achieved to create engineered tissue flaps. Here, millimetric vessel&#8208;like scaffolds and 3D bioprinted vascularized tissues interconnect, creating fully engineered hierarchical vascular constructs for implantation. Endothelial and support cells spontaneously form microvascular networks in bioprinted tissues using a human collagen bioink. Sacrificial molds are used to create polymeric vessel&#8208;like scaffolds and endothelial cells seeded in their lumen form native&#8208;like endothelia. Assembling endothelialized scaffolds within vascularizing hydrogels incites the bioprinted vasculature and endothelium to cooperatively create vessels, enabling tissue perfusion through the scaffold lumen. Using a cuffing microsurgery approach, the engineered tissue is directly anastomosed with a rat femoral artery, promoting a rich host vasculature within the implanted tissue. After two weeks in vivo, contrast microcomputer tomography imaging and lectin perfusion of explanted engineered tissues verify the host ingrowth vasculature's functionality. Furthermore, the hierarchical vessel network (VesselNet) supports in vitro functionality of cardiomyocytes. Finally, the proposed approach is expanded to mimic complex structures with native&#8208;like millimetric vessels. This work presents a novel strategy aiming to create fully&#8208;engineered patient&#8208;specific thick tissue flaps.

         <title>Switchable Photonic Bio&#8208;Adhesive Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 42, October 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft photonic bio&#8208;adhesive demonstrates large reversible changes in adhesion power and mechanical strength with concurrent self&#8208;reporting colorimetric responses. This coupled behavior is derived by the humidity&#8208;driven intercalation/removal of water molecules into a glucose&#8208;containing hydrogen&#8208;bonded polymer network within a liquid crystal polysaccharide matrix that triggers tightly correlated changes in mechanical strength, adhesion, and pitch length of the chiral nematic organization.








Abstract
A soft photonic bio&#8208;adhesive material is designed with real&#8208;time colorimetrical monitoring of switchable adhesion by integrating a responsive bio&#8208;photonic matrix with mobile hydrogen&#8208;binding networking. Synergetic materials sequencing creates a unique iridescent appearance directly coupled with both adhesive ability and shearing strength, in a highly reversible manner. The responsive photonic materials, having a physically hydrogen&#8208;bonded chiral nematic organization, vary their adhesion strength due to a transition in cohesive and interfacial failure mechanism in humid surroundings. The bright color appearance shifts from blue to red to transparent and back due to a change in pitch length of the chiral helicoidal organization that also triggers coupled changes in both mechanical strength and interfacial adhesion. Such reversible strength&#8208;adhesion&#8208;iridescence triple&#8208;coupling phenomenon is further explored for design of super&#8208;strong switchable bio&#8208;adhesives for synthetic/biological surfaces with quick remotely triggered sticky&#8208;to&#8208;nonsticky transitions, removable conformal soft stickers, and wound dressings with visual monitoring of the healing process, to colorimetric stickers for contaminated respiratory masks.

         <title>Constructing Graphitic&#8208;Nitrogen&#8208;Bonded Pentagons in Interlayer&#8208;Expanded Graphene Matrix toward Carbon&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for Acidic Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 42, October 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel carbon&#8208;based electrocatalyst toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in 0.1 m HClO4 is reported, with half&#8208;wave potential of 0.81&#160;V and better durability. It is achieved by constructing graphitic&#8208;nitrogen (GN)&#8208;bonded pentagons in graphitic carbon to improve the intrinsic activity of carbon sites and increasing the amount of active sites via expanding the interlayer spacing.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based materials with high electrocatalytic activity are promising catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in several renewable energy systems. However, the performance of carbon&#8208;based materials is far inferior to that of Pt&#8208;based catalysts in acid electrolytes. Here, a novel carbon&#8208;based electrocatalyst is reported toward ORR in 0.1 m HClO4 with half&#8208;wave potential of 0.81&#160;V and better durability (100 h reaction time)&#160;than commercial 20 wt% Pt/C. It is achieved by constructing graphitic&#8208;nitrogen (GN)&#8208;bonded pentagons in graphitic carbon to improve the intrinsic activity of the carbon sites and increasing the amount of active sites via expanding the interlayer spacing. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and aberration&#8208;corrected electron microscopy characterizations confirm the formation of GN&#8208;bonded pentagons in this carbon material. Raman and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that the activity is linearly associated with the amounts of both pentagons and adjacent GN atoms. Density function theory further demonstrates that adjacent GN atoms significantly increase the charge density at the carbon atom of a GN&#8208;bonded pentagon, which is the activity origin for the ORR.

&lt;p&gt;A novel carbon-based electrocatalyst toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in 0.1 &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; HClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is reported, with half-wave potential of 0.81&#160;V and better durability. It is achieved by constructing graphitic-nitrogen (GN)-bonded pentagons in graphitic carbon to improve the intrinsic activity of carbon sites and increasing the amount of active sites via expanding the interlayer spacing.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal-free carbon-based materials with high electrocatalytic activity are promising catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in several renewable energy systems. However, the performance of carbon-based materials is far inferior to that of Pt-based catalysts in acid electrolytes. Here, a novel carbon-based electrocatalyst is reported toward ORR in 0.1 &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; HClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with half-wave potential of 0.81&#160;V and better durability (100 h reaction time)&#160;than commercial 20 wt% Pt/C. It is achieved by constructing graphitic-nitrogen (GN)-bonded pentagons in graphitic carbon to improve the intrinsic activity of the carbon sites and increasing the amount of active sites via expanding the interlayer spacing. X-ray absorption spectroscopy and aberration-corrected electron microscopy characterizations confirm the formation of GN-bonded pentagons in this carbon material. Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that the activity is linearly associated with the amounts of both pentagons and adjacent GN atoms. Density function theory further demonstrates that adjacent GN atoms significantly increase the charge density at the carbon atom of a GN-bonded pentagon, which is the activity origin for the ORR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tethering Cells via Enzymatic Oxidative Crosslinking Enables Mechanotransduction in Non&#8208;Cell&#8208;Adhesive Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 42, October 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cells need to sense their environment in order to survive and function. In this study an enzymatic crosslinking strategy that can tether non&#8208;cell&#8208;adhesive materials to cells is presented. By targeting the cellular adhesome, this cell&#8211;material tethering method enables cell&#8208;volume&#8208;independent lineage programming of stem cells in engineered 3D microniches with controlled stiffness.








Abstract
Cell&#8211;matrix interactions govern cell behavior and tissue function by facilitating transduction of biomechanical cues. Engineered tissues often incorporate these interactions by employing cell&#8208;adhesive materials. However, using constitutively active cell&#8208;adhesive materials impedes control over cell fate and elicits inflammatory responses upon implantation. Here, an alternative cell&#8211;material interaction strategy that provides mechanotransducive properties via discrete inducible on&#8208;cell crosslinking (DOCKING) of materials, including those that are inherently non&#8208;cell&#8208;adhesive, is introduced. Specifically, tyramine&#8208;functionalized materials are tethered to tyrosines that are naturally present in extracellular protein domains via enzyme&#8208;mediated oxidative crosslinking. Temporal control over the stiffness of on&#8208;cell tethered 3D microniches reveals that DOCKING uniquely enables lineage programming of stem cells by targeting adhesome&#8208;related mechanotransduction pathways acting independently of cell volume changes and spreading. In short, DOCKING represents a bioinspired and cytocompatible cell&#8208;tethering strategy that offers new routes to study and engineer cell&#8211;material interactions, thereby advancing applications ranging from drug delivery, to cell&#8208;based therapy, and cultured meat.

         <title>Force&#8208;Based Wetting Characterization of Stochastic Superhydrophobic Coatings at Nanonewton Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 42, October 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scanning droplet adhesion microscopy and micropipette&#8208;based droplet friction measurements are used for quantitative evaluation of the wetting properties of stochastic superhydrophobic coatings. These novel force&#8208;based characterization techniques provide a detailed picture of the wetting performance and heterogeneity of super&#8208;repellent surfaces, far beyond what is afforded by traditional contact angle measurements.








Abstract
Superhydrophobic coatings have extraordinary properties like self&#8208;cleaning and staying dry, and have recently appeared on industrial and consumer markets. The stochastic nature of the coating components and coating processes (e.g., spraying, painting) affects the uniformity of the water repellency across the coated substrate. The wetting properties of those coatings are typically quantified on macroscale using contact angle goniometry (CAG). Here, highly sensitive force&#8208;based methods, scanning droplet adhesion microscopy (SDAM), and micropipette force sensor (MFS), are used, to quantify the microscale heterogeneity in the wetting properties of stochastic superhydrophobic coatings with irregular surface topography that cannot be investigated by CAG. By mapping the wetting adhesion forces with SDAM and friction forces with MFS, it is demonstrated that even the best coatings on the market are prone to heterogeneities that induce stick&#8211;slip motion of droplets. Thus, owing to their high spatial and force resolution, the advantages of these techniques over CAG are demonstrated.

         <title>Localized Graphitization on Diamond Surface as a Manifestation of Dopants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 42, October 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic&#8208;scale imaging and spectroscopy of boron&#8208;doped diamond (BDD) film electrodes reveal localized dopant&#8208;induced surface graphitization. This work presents the first experimental demonstration of dopant effects on the surface morphology of doped diamond and explains the role of boron in the formation of density of states in BDD and the strong crystallographic orientation dependence of its electrochemical activity.








Abstract
Doped diamond electrodes have attracted significant attention for decades owing to their excellent physical and electrochemical properties. However, direct experimental observation of dopant effects on the diamond surface has not been available until now. Here, low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy is utilized to investigate the atomic&#8208;scale morphology and electronic structures of (100)&#8208; and (111)&#8208;oriented boron&#8208;doped diamond (BDD) electrodes. Graphitized domains of a few nanometers are shown to manifest the effects of boron dopants on the BDD surface. Confirmed by first&#8208;principles calculations, local density of states measurements reveal that the electronic structure of these features is characterized by in&#8208;gap states induced by boron&#8208;related lattice deformation. The dopant&#8208;related graphitization is uniquely observed in BDD (111), which explains its electrochemical superiority over the (100) facet. These experimental observations provide atomic&#8208;scale information about the role of dopants in modulating the conductivity of diamond, as well as, possibly, other functional doped materials.

         <title>A &#8220;Bridge&#8208;Building&#8221; Glycan Scaffold Mimicking Microbial Invasion for In Situ Endothelialization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 42, October 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A glycan substrate (GMDE) can preferentially support endothelial cells (ECs) adhesion by binding galectin&#8208;1, a carbohydrate&#8208;binding protein highly secreted by ECs, which in turn connects the substrate with the integrin receptors of the ECs. Implantation of GMDE promotes blood vessel formation in a murine ischemic model, suggesting its potential for future vascular therapy.








Abstract
The globally high prevalence of peripheral artery diseases poses a pressing need for biomaterials grafts to rebuild vasculature. When implanted, they should promote endothelial cells (ECs) adhesion both profoundly and selectively&#8212;but the latter expectation remains unfulfilled. Here, this work is inspired by fungi that invade blood vessels via the &#8220;bridge&#8221; of galectins that, secreted by ECs, can simultaneously bind carbohydrates on fungal surface and integrin receptors on ECs. A glucomannan decanoate (GMDE) substrate mimicking fungal carbohydrates that highly and preferentially supports ECs adhesion while rejecting several other cell types is designed. Electrospun GMDE scaffolds efficiently sequester endogenous galectin&#8208;1&#8212;which bridges ECs to the scaffolds as it functions in fungal invasions&#8212;and promote blood perfusion in a murine limb ischemic model. Meanwhile, the application of GMDE requires no exogenous pro&#8208;angiogenic agents and causes no organ toxicity or adverse inflammation in mice, highlighting its high safety of potential translation. This glycan material, uniquely mimicking a microbial action and harnessing a secreted protein as a &#8220;bridge,&#8221; represents an effective, safe, and different strategy for ischemic vascular therapy.

         <title>Unconstrained 3D Shape Programming with Light&#8208;Induced Stress Gradient</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 42, October 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through introducing light&#8208;responsive diselenide bonds into polymer films, homogeneous stress fixed by shape&#8208;memory effect can be relaxed to form a stress gradient. Once the stress gradient is activated, various deformations, including bending, folding, twisting, and helix, can be realized through the asymmetric contraction, which can be further combined for 3D shape programming, sequential deformation, and microscopic optical patterning.








Abstract
Programming 2D sheets to form 3D shapes is significant for flexible electronics, soft robots, and biomedical devices. Stress regulation is one of the most used methods, during which external force is usually needed to keep the stress, leading to complex processing setups. Here, by introducing dynamic diselenide bonds into shape&#8208;memory materials, unconstrained shape programming with light is achieved. The material could hold and release internal stress by themselves through the shape&#8208;memory effect, simplifying programming setups. The fixed stress could be relaxed by light to form stress gradients, leading to out&#8208;of&#8208;plane deformations through asymmetric contractions. Benefiting from the variability of light irradiation, complex 3D configurations can be obtained conveniently from 2D polymer sheets. Besides, remotely controlled &#8220;4D assembly&#8221; and actuation, including object transportation and self&#8208;lifting, can be achieved by sequential deformation. Taking advantage of the high spatial resolution of light, this material can also produce 3D microscopic patterns. The light&#8208;induced stress gradients significantly simplify 3D shape programming procedures with improved resolution and complexity and have great potential in soft robots, smart actuators, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting techniques.

         <title>Ferromagnetic&#8211;Antiferromagnetic Coupling Core&#8211;Shell Nanoparticles with Spin Conservation for Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 42, October 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Core&#8211;shell Fe3O4@Ni(OH)2 catalysts with different core sizes and shell thicknesses that mimic surface&#8208;reconstructed catalysts, are made to investigate the effect of magnetic domain structure on magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;improved oxygen evolution activity. Only the catalyst with a multiple domain core and a relatively thin shell exhibits a significant enhancement under the external magnetic field.








Abstract
Rational design of active oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts is critical for the overall efficiency of water electrolysis. The differing spin states of the OER reactants and products is one of the factors that slows OER kinetics. Thus, spin conservation plays a crucial role in enhancing OER performance. In this work, ferromagnetic (FM)&#8211;antiferromagnetic (AFM) Fe3O4@Ni(OH)2 core&#8211;shell catalysts are designed. The interfacial FM&#8211;AFM coupling of these catalysts facilitates selective removal of electrons with spin direction opposing the magnetic moment of FM core, improving OER kinetics. The shell thickness is found critical in retaining the coupling effect for OER enhancement. The magnetic domain structure of the FM core also plays a critical role. With a multiple domain core, the applied magnetic field aligns the magnetic domains, optimizing the electron transport process. A significant enhancement of OER activity is observed for the multiple domain core catalysts. With a single&#8208;domain FM core with ordered magnetic dipoles, the spin&#8208;selective electron transport with minimal scattering is facilitated even without an applied magnetic field. A magnetism/OER activity model therefore hypothesizes that depends on two main parameters: interfacial spin coupling and domain structure. These findings provide new design principles for active OER catalysts.

Cell&#8211;Material Tethering
Cells need to sense their environment in order to survive and function. In article number 2102660, Tom Kamperman, Jeroen Leijten, and co&#8208;workers present an enzymatic crosslinking strategy that can tether non&#8208;cell&#8208;adhesive materials to cells. By targeting the cellular adhesome, this cell&#8211;material tethering method enables cell&#8208;volume&#8208;independent lineage programming of stem cells in engineered 3D microniches with controlled stiffness.

In Situ Endothelialization
In article number 2103490, Lei Dong, Chunming Wang, and co&#8208;workers describe how fungal sugars in bioscaffold design are mimicked to support vascular growth. When microbes invade human tissue, their surface carbo hydrates bridge the endothelium for further transmigration. Glucomannans are chemically modified and electrospun into a fibrous scaffold, which recruits galectins to bridge endothelial cells with the scaffold. This helps to recover blood perfusion in a murine ischemic model.

3D Bioprinting
Millimetric tubular scaffolds and 3D bioprinted vascularized collagen hydrogels are combined by Shulamit Levenberg and co&#8208;workers in article number 2102661 to create engineered hierarchically vascularized tissues (engineered flap) consisting of rich microvascular networks in communication with an engineered endothelium. The in vitro cultured flaps are directly anastomosed to the host vasculature, successfully perfusing the implanted tissue. This work represents a step forward to achieving large fully engineered human tissues.

Programmable Anisotropic Transformations
In article number 2105024, Joanna Aizenberg, Katia Bertoldi, and co&#8208;workers report that by programming independently anisotropy at the molecular and structural levels, unprecedented director&#8208;determined symmetry breaking can be realized in microcellular structures made of liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs). These can be exploited to achieve switchable and direction&#8208;dependent frictional properties as well as to modulate light.

         <title>Wearable Thermoelectric Materials and Devices for Self&#8208;Powered Electronic Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 42, October 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wearable thermoelectric generators (WTEGs) have emerged as promising candidates for the effective conversion of body heat into electricity to power wearable devices. Recent advancements in the development of WTEGs are reviewed, from the material design to final device application. The problems in the WTEG devices and the future research directions in this field are also discussed.








Abstract
The emergence of artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things has led to a growing demand for wearable and maintenance&#8208;free power sources. The continual push toward lower operating voltages and power consumption in modern integrated circuits has made the development of devices powered by body heat finally feasible. In this context, thermoelectric (TE) materials have emerged as promising candidates for the effective conversion of body heat into electricity to power wearable devices without being limited by environmental conditions. Driven by rapid advances in processing technology and the performance of TE materials over the past two decades, wearable thermoelectric generators (WTEGs) have gradually become more flexible and stretchable so that they can be used on complex and dynamic surfaces. In this review, the functional materials, processing techniques, and strategies for the device design of different types of WTEGs are comprehensively covered. Wearable self&#8208;powered systems based on WTEGs are summarized, including multi&#8208;function TE modules, hybrid energy harvesting, and all&#8208;in&#8208;one energy devices. Challenges in organic TE materials, interfacial engineering, and assessments of device performance are discussed, and suggestions for future developments in the area are provided. This review will promote the rapid implementation of wearable TE materials and devices in self&#8208;powered electronic systems.

         <title>Biodegradable Small&#8208;Scale Swimmers for Biomedical Applications</title>

Due to their motion abilities, micro&#8208; and nanoswimmers are proposed as minimally invasive tools for precision healthcare applications. When designed for temporary treatments, these devices should exhibit the ability to degrade in the body with minimal disruption after accomplishing their designated tasks. Recent research efforts on the topic of biodegradable micro&#8208; and nanoswimmers for biomedical applications are summarized.








Abstract
Most forms of biomatter are ephemeral, which means they transform or deteriorate after a certain time. From this perspective, implantable healthcare devices designed for temporary treatments should exhibit the ability to degrade and either blend in with healthy tissues, or be cleared from the body with minimal disruption after accomplishing their designated tasks. This topic is currently being investigated in the field of biomedical micro&#8208; and nanoswimmers. These tiny devices have the ability to move through fluids by converting physical or chemical energy into motion. Several architectures of these devices have been designed to mimic the motion strategies of nature's motile microorganisms and cells. Due to their motion abilities, these devices have been proposed as minimally invasive tools for precision healthcare applications. Hence, a natural progression in this field is to produce motile structures that can adopt, or even surpass, similar transient features as biological systems. The fate of small&#8208;scale swimmers after accomplishing their therapeutic mission is critical for the successful translation of small&#8208;scale swimmers&#8217; technologies into clinical applications. In this review, recent research efforts are summarized on the topic of biodegradable micro&#8208; and nanoswimmers for biomedical applications, with a focus on targeted therapeutic delivery.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Harsh&#8208;Environment&#8208;Resistant GaOX Solar&#8208;Blind Photodetectors via Defect and Doping Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Certain application situations of solar&#8208;blind photodetectors (SBPDs) inevitably face harsh conditions (e.g., high temperature/electronic&#8208;field/radiation). Gallium oxide with an ultrawide bandgap is regarded as one of the most promising materials for SBPDs. Defect and doping engineering, including Ga&#8208;rich design and doping compensation, has been demonstrated as an effective strategy for low&#8208;cost amorphous GaOX to force a way towards harsh&#8208;condition&#8208;resistant SBPDs.








Abstract
Gallium oxide (Ga2O3), with an ultrawide bandgap, is currently regarded as one of the most promising materials for solar&#8208;blind photodetectors (SBPDs), which are greatly demanded in harsh environment, such as space exploration and flame prewarning. However, realization of high&#8208;performance SBPDs with high tolerance toward harsh environments based on low&#8208;cost Ga2O3 material faces great challenges. Here, defect and doping (DD) engineering towards amorphous GaOX (a&#8208;GaOX) has been proposed to obtain ultrasensitive SBPDs for harsh condition application. Serious oxygen deficiency and doping compensation of the engineered a&#8208;GaOX film ensure the high response currents and low dark currents, respectively. Annealing item in nitrogen of DD engineering also incurs the recrystallization of material, formation of nanopores by oxygen escape, and suppression of sub&#8208;bandgap defect states. As a result, the tailored GaOX SBPD based on DD engineering not only harvests a record&#8208;high responsivity rejection ratio (R254 nm/R365 nm) of 1.8&#160;&#215;&#160;107, 102 times higher detectivity, and 2&#160;&#215;&#160;102 times faster decay speed than the control device, but also keeps a high responsivity, high photo&#8208;to&#8208;dark current ratio, and sharp imaging capability even at high temperature (280&#160;&#176;C) or high bias (100&#160;V). The proposed DD engineering provides an effective strategy towards highly harsh&#8208;environment&#8208;resistant GaOX SBPDs.

         <title>Uncommon Behavior of Li Doping Suppresses Oxygen Redox in P2&#8208;Type Manganese&#8208;Rich Sodium Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
P2&#8208;type manganese&#8208;rich cathodes can have stabilized oxygen redox through doping Li/Mg to create unhybridized O 2p orbitals or introducing high covalency transition metals to induce a reductive coupling effect. This study on the model materials of P2&#8208;Na0.66Mn0.75Ni0.25O2 with and without Li doping reveals that the doped Li has complicated interactions with transition metals leading to an unusual oxygen redox suppression.








Abstract
Utilizing both cationic and anionic oxygen redox reactions is regarded as an important approach to exploit high&#8208;capacity layered cathode materials with earth abundant elements. It has been popular strategies to effectively elevate the oxygen redox activities by Li&#8208;doping to introduce unhybridized O 2p orbitals in NaxMnO2&#8208;based chemistries or enabling high covalency transition metals in P2&#8208;Na0.66MnxTM1&#8722;xO2 (TM = Fe, Cu, Ni) materials. Here, the effect of Li doping on regulating the oxygen redox activities P2&#8208;structured Na0.66Ni0.25Mn0.75O2 materials is investigated. Systematic X&#8208;ray characterizations and ab initio simulations have shown that the doped Li has uncommon behavior in modulating the density of states of the neighboring Ni, Mn, and O, leading to the suppression of the existing oxygen and Mn redox reactivities and the promotion of the Ni redox. The findings provide a complementary scenario to current oxygen redox mechanisms and shed lights on developing new routes for high&#8208;performance cathodes.

         <title>Fe3O4/Ag/Bi2MoO6 Photoactivatable Nanozyme for Self&#8208;Replenishing and Sustainable Cascaded Nanocatalytic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; photoactivable nanozyme (Fe3O4/Ag/Bi2MoO6) enables self&#8208;replenishing cascaded nanocatalytic reactions in tumor microenvironment for outstanding synergistic chemodynamic, photodynamic, photothermal therapy with guidance by multimode imagings.








Abstract
Catalytic cancer therapy based on nanozymes has recently attracted much interest. However, the types of the current nanozymes are limited and their efficiency is usually compromised and not sustainable in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Therefore, combination therapy involving additional therapeutics is often necessary and the resulting complication may jeopardize the practical feasibility. Herein, an unprecedented &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; Fe3O4/Ag/Bi2MoO6 nanoparticle (FAB NP) is rationally devised to achieve synergistic chemodynamic, photodynamic, photothermal therapy with guidance by magnetic resonance, photoacoustic, and photothermal imaging. Based on its manifold nanozyme activities (mimicking peroxidase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione oxidase) and photodynamic property, cascaded nanocatalytic reactions are enabled and sustained in TME for outstanding therapeutic outcomes. The working mechanisms underlying the intraparticulate interactions, sustainability, and self&#8208;replenishment arising from the coupling between the nanocatalytic reactions and nanozyme activities are carefully revealed, providing new insights into the design of novel nanozymes for nanocatalytic therapy with high efficiency, good specificity, and low side effects.

         <title>2D Molybdenum Carbide MXenes for Enhanced Selective Detection of Humidity in Air</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D Mo2CTx MXene flakes are successfully synthesized and studied on their chemiresistive effect, demonstrating an enhanced sensitivity toward water vapors at room temperature in dry air. The low&#8208;noise resistance signal allows the detection of H2O down to 10&#160;ppm, with humidity suppressing the Mo2CTx response to organic analytes due to the blocking of adsorption active sites.








Abstract
2D transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) open up novel opportunities in gas sensing with high sensitivity at room temperature. Herein, 2D Mo2CTx flakes with high aspect ratio are successfully synthesized. The chemiresistive effect in a sub&#8208;&#181;m MXene multilayer for different organic vapors and humidity at 101&#8211;104&#160;ppm in dry air is studied. Reasonably, the low&#8208;noise resistance signal allows the detection of H2O down to 10&#160;ppm. Moreover, humidity suppresses the response of Mo2CTx to organic analytes due to the blocking of adsorption active sites. By measuring the impedance of MXene layers as a function of ac frequency in the 10&#8722;2&#8211;106&#160;Hz range, it is shown that operation principle of the sensor is dominated by resistance change rather than capacitance variations. The sensor transfer function allows to conclude that the Mo2CTx chemiresistance is mainly originating from electron transport through interflake potential barriers with heights up to 0.2&#160;eV. Density functional theory calculations, elucidating the Mo2C surface interaction with organic analytes and H2O, explain the experimental data as an energy shift of the density of states under the analyte's adsorption which induces increasing electrical resistance.

         <title>Designing and Demystifying the Lithium Metal Interface toward Highly Reversible Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A viable methodology is proposed to build highly reversible Li metal anodes by carefully designing the interface, which concurrently contributes to flattened Li deposition and minimizes inactive Li growth rates. Anode&#8208;free coin and pouch cells are further assembled to demonstrate the profound significance of anode Coulombic efficiency on the capacity retention of full cells.








Abstract
Reversible lithium (Li) plating/stripping is essential for building practical high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries based on Li metal chemistry, which unfortunately remains a severe challenge. In this contribution, it is demonstrated that through the rational regulation of strong Li+&#8722;anion coordination structures in a highly compatible low&#8208;polarity solvent, 2&#8208;methyl tetrahydrofuran, the Li plating/stripping assisted by a nucleation modulation procedure delivers a remarkably high average Coulombic efficiency under rather demanding conditions (99.7% and 99.5% under 1.0&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, 3.0&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2 and 3.0&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, 3.0&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2, respectively). The exceedingly reversible cycling obtained herein is fundamentally correlated with the flattened Li deposition and minimized solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) generation/reconstruction in the customized condition, which notably restrains the growth rates of both dead Li0 (0.0120&#160;mAh per cycle) and SEI&#8208;Li+ (0.0191&#160;mAh per cycle) during consecutive cycles. Benefiting from the efficient Li plating/stripping manner, the assembled anode&#8208;free Cu|LiFePO4 (2.7&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2) coin and pouch cells exhibit impressive capacity retention of 43.8% and 41.6% after 150 cycles, respectively, albeit with no optimization on the test conditions. This work provides guidelines into the targeted interfacial design of high&#8208;efficiency working Li anodes, aiming to pave the way for the practical deployment of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries.

         <title>Coupling Spin Defects in a Layered Material to Nanoscale Plasmonic Cavities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of plasmonic gap cavities are used to enhance emission from spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The cavities are silver nanocubes&#160;positioned on top of a gold mirror, encapsulating multilayer hBN with embedded boron vacancy spin defects. Nearly an order of magnitude enhancement is demonstrated at room temperature, associated with an efficient optically detected magnetic resonance readout.








Abstract
Spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride, and specifically the negatively charged boron vacancy (VB&#8208;) centers, are emerging candidates for quantum sensing. However, the VB&#8208; defects suffer from low quantum efficiency and, as a result, exhibit weak photoluminescence. In this work, a scalable approach is demonstrated to dramatically enhance the VB&#8208; emission by coupling to a plasmonic gap cavity. The plasmonic cavity is composed of a flat gold surface and a silver cube, with few&#8208;layer hBN flakes positioned in between. Employing these plasmonic cavities, two orders of magnitude are extracted in photoluminescence enhancement associated with a corresponding twofold enhancement in optically detected magnetic resonance contrast. The work will be pivotal to progress in quantum sensing employing 2D materials, and in realization of nanophotonic devices with spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride.

         <title>Using Dipole Interaction to Achieve Nonvolatile Voltage Control of Magnetism in Multiferroic Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy using the dipole interaction to achieve nonvolatile electrical control of magnetism is demonstrated in an interacting magnet using a volatile strain. This work reveals the important role of dipole interaction in multiferroic heterostructures and can stimulate future research on the electrical control of magnetism by introducing additional interactions to multiferroic heterostructures.








Abstract
Nonvolatile electrical control of magnetism is crucial for developing energy&#8208;efficient magnetic memory. Based on strain&#8208;mediated magnetoelectric coupling, a multiferroic heterostructure containing an isolated magnet requires nonvolatile strain to achieve this control. However, the magnetization response of an interacting magnet to strain remains elusive. Herein, Co/MgO/CoFeB magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) exhibiting dipole interaction on ferroelectric substrates are fabricated. Remarkably, nonvolatile voltage control of the resistance in the MTJs is demonstrated, which originates from the nonvolatile magnetization rotation of an interacting CoFeB magnet driven by volatile voltage&#8208;generated strain. Conversely, for an isolated CoFeB magnet, this volatile strain induces volatile control of magnetism. These results reveal that the magnetization response to volatile strain among interacting magnets is different from that among isolated magnets. The findings highlight the role of dipole interaction in multiferroic heterostructures and can stimulate future research on nonvolatile electrical control of magnetism with additional interactions.

         <title>A Novel Porous Ti&#8208;Squarate as Efficient Photocatalyst in the Overall Water Splitting Reaction under Simulated Sunlight Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel porous titanium(IV) squarate metal&#8211;organic framework with outstanding and recyclable photocatalytic activity on the overall water splitting reaction under simulated sunlight is reported.








Abstract
A new porous titanium(IV) squarate metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), denoted as IEF&#8208;11, having a never reported titanium secondary building unit, is successfully synthesized and fully characterized. IEF&#8208;11 not only exhibits a permanent porosity but also an outstanding chemical stability. Further, as a consequence of combining the photoactive Ti(IV) and the electroactive squarate, IEF&#8208;11 presents relevant optoelectronic properties, applied here to the photocatalytic overall water splitting reaction. Remarkably, IEF&#8208;11 as a photocatalyst is able to produce record H2 amounts for MOF&#8208;based materials under simulated sunlight (up to 672 &#181;mol gcatalyst in 22 h) without any activity loss during at least 10 d.

&lt;p&gt;A new porous titanium(IV) squarate metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), denoted as IEF-11, having a never reported titanium secondary building unit, is successfully synthesized and fully characterized. IEF-11 not only exhibits a permanent porosity but also an outstanding chemical stability. Further, as a consequence of combining the photoactive Ti(IV) and the electroactive squarate, IEF-11 presents relevant optoelectronic properties, applied here to the photocatalytic overall water splitting reaction. Remarkably, IEF-11 as a photocatalyst is able to produce record H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; amounts for MOF-based materials under simulated sunlight (up to 672 &#181;mol g&lt;sub&gt;catalyst&lt;/sub&gt; in 22 h) without any activity loss during at least 10 d.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Extracellular Vesicles Enriched with Palmitoylated ACE2 as COVID&#8208;19 Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered EVs enriched with palmitoylated ACE2 (PM&#8208;ACE2) efficiently capture SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 viruses and block their interaction with the cell surface ACE2, leading to reduced infection both in vitro and in vivo. This work identifies a novel palmitoylation&#8208;dependent mechanism whereby human cells package ACE2 into EVs, meanwhile developing PM&#8208;ACE2&#8208;EVs as a novel candidate for prophylactic and therapeutic treatment against COVID&#8208;19.








Abstract
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a key receptor present on cell surfaces that directly interacts with the viral spike (S) protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus&#8208;2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2). It is proposed that inhibiting this interaction can be promising in treating COVID&#8208;19. Here, the presence of ACE2 in extracellular vesicles (EVs) is reported and the EV&#8208;ACE2 levels are determined by protein palmitoylation. The Cys141 and Cys498 residues on ACE2 are S&#8208;palmitoylated by zinc finger DHHC&#8208;Type Palmitoyltransferase 3 (ZDHHC3) and de&#8208;palmitoylated by acyl protein thioesterase 1 (LYPLA1), which is critical for the membrane&#8208;targeting of ACE2 and their EV secretion. Importantly, by fusing the S&#8208;palmitoylation&#8208;dependent plasma membrane (PM) targeting sequence with ACE2, EVs enriched with ACE2 on their surface (referred to as PM&#8208;ACE2&#8208;EVs) are engineered. It is shown that PM&#8208;ACE2&#8208;EVs can bind to the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 S&#8208;RBD with high affinity and block its interaction with cell surface ACE2 in vitro. PM&#8208;ACE2&#8208;EVs show neutralization potency against pseudotyped and authentic SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in human ACE2 (hACE2) transgenic mice, efficiently block viral load of authentic SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, and thus protect host against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;induced lung inflammation. The study provides an efficient engineering protocol for constructing a promising, novel biomaterial for application in prophylactic and therapeutic treatments against COVID&#8208;19.

         <title>Modeling the Triboelectric Behaviors of Elastomeric Nonwoven Fabrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Theoretical modeling of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) is fundamental to their performance optimization, since it can provide useful guidance on the material selection, structure design, and parameter control of relevant systems. Built on the theoretical model of film&#8208;based TENGs, here we introduce an analytical model for conductor&#8208;to&#8208;dielectric contact&#8208;mode nonwoven&#8208;based TENGs, which copes with the unique hierarchical structure of nonwovens and details the correlation between the triboelectric output (maximum transferred charge density) and nonwoven structural parameters (thickness, solidity, and average fiber diameter). A series of styrene&#8208;ethylene&#8208;butylene&#8208;styrene (SEBS, KratonTM MD1653) nonwoven samples have been fabricated through the melt&#8208;blowing process in a pilot&#8208;plant setting to map elastomeric nonwoven structural features within certain ranges, while an ion&#8208;injection testing protocol is adopted to quantify the triboelectric output with superior consistency and reproducibility. With a database containing structural features and triboelectric output of 43 nonwoven samples, the curve fitting is performed by employing non&#8208;linear regression analysis in Python. This model shows good prediction power while suggesting that the triboelectric output of nonwoven&#8208;based TENGs reaches a maximum in conductor&#8208;to&#8208;dielectric contact&#8208;mode at a specific thickness, solidity, or average fiber diameter when other structural features are fixed. Lastly, the model also shows a decent prediction performance on polypropylene (PP) meltblown nonwoven system, which verified the universality of the model on meltblown nownoven based TENGs.

         <title>Programmable zwitterionic droplets as biomolecular sorters and model of membraneless organelles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Increasing evidence indicates that cells can regulate biochemical functions in time and space by generating membraneless compartments with well&#8208;defined mesoscopic properties. One important mechanism underlying this control is simple coacervation driven by associative disordered proteins that encode multivalent interactions. Inspired by these observations, we developed programmable droplets based on simple coacervation of responsive synthetic polymers that mimic the &#8220;stickers&#8208;and&#8208;spacers&#8221; architecture of biological disordered proteins. We designed zwitterionic polymers that undergo an enthalpy&#8208;driven liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation process and form liquid droplets that remarkably exclude most molecules. Starting from this reference material, we progressively added different functional groups in the zwitterionic polymer to encode an increasing number of different intermolecular interactions. This strategy allowed us to independently control multiple emerging properties of the droplets, such as stimulus&#8208;responsiveness, polarity, selective uptake of client molecules, fusion times, and miscibility. By exploiting this high programmability, we reproduced a model of cellular compartmentalization and generated droplets capable of confining different molecules in space without physical barriers. Moreover, we demonstrated that these biomolecular sorters can localize, separate and enable the detection of target molecules even within complex mixtures, opening attractive applications in bioseparation and diagnostics.

         <title>2D Cu9S5/PtS2/WSe2 Double Heterojunction Bipolar Transistor with High Current Gain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D&#8208;material based Cu9S5/PtS2/WSe2 double heterojunction bipolar transistor (DHBT) is constructed by direct mechanical transfer and exhibits high current gain (&#946;&#160;&#8776; 910 under common&#8208;emitter mode). This excellent performance is mainly attributed to restrained reverse current flux from base into emitter and thus greatly improves injection efficiency.








Abstract
Bipolar junction transistor (BJT) as one important circuit element is now widely used in high&#8208;speed computation and communication for its capability of high&#8208;power signal amplification. 2D materials and their heterostructures are promising in building high&#8208;amplification and high&#8208;frequency BJTs because they can be naturally thin and highly designable in tailoring components properties. However, currently the low emitter injection efficiency results in only moderate current gain achieved in the pioneer researches, severely restraining its future development. Herein, it is shown that an elaborately designed double heterojunction bipolar transistor (DHBT) can greatly promote the injection efficiency, improving the current gain by order of magnitude. In this DHBT high&#8208;doping&#8208;density wide&#8208;bandgap 2D Cu9S5 is used as emitter and narrow&#8208;bandgap PtS2 as base. This heterostructure efficiently suppresses the reverse electron flux from base and increase the injection efficiency. Consequently, the DHBT achieves an excellent current gain (&#946; &#8776; 910). This work systematically explores the electrical behavior of 2D materials based DHBT, and provides deep insight of the architecture design for building high gain DHBT, which may promote the applications of 2Dheterojunctions in the fields of integrated circuits.

         <title>Viologen&#8208;Immobilized 2D Polymer Film Enabling Highly Efficient Electrochromic Device for Solar&#8208;Powered Smart Window</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully crystalline viologen&#8208;immobilized 2D polymer (V2DP) film is synthesized, which enables high utilization of viologen moieties and fast ion transport. On this basis, the as&#8208;fabricated V2DP&#8208;based ECDs exhibit a rapid switching speed, and a high coloration efficiency (989 cm2 C&#8722;1). Furthermore, the highly efficient V2DP ECDs are vertically integrated with transparent solar cells, thereby generating energy&#8208;saving EC window systems.








Abstract
Electrochromic devices (ECDs) have emerged as a unique class of optoelectronic devices for the development of smart windows. However, current ECDs typically suffer from low coloration efficiency (CE) and high energy consumption, which have thus hindered their practical applications, especially as components in solar&#8208;powered EC windows. Here, the high&#8208;performance ECDs with a fully crystalline viologen&#8208;immobilized 2D polymer (V2DP) thin film as the color&#8208;switching layer is demonstrated. The high density of vertically oriented pore channels (pore size &#8776; 4.5&#160;nm; pore density &#8776; 5.8 &#215; 1016 m&#8208;2) in the synthetic V2DP film enables high utilization of redox&#8208;active viologen moieties and benefits for Li+ ion diffusion/transport. As a result, the as&#8208;fabricated ECDs achieve a rapid switching speed (coloration, 2.8 s; bleaching, 1.2 s), and a high CE (989 cm2 C&#8208;1), and low energy consumption (21.1 &#181;W cm&#8208;2). Moreover, it is managed to fabricate transmission&#8208;tunable, self&#8208;sustainable EC window prototypes by vertically integrating the V2DP ECDs with transparent solar cells. This work sheds light on designing electroactive 2D polymers with molecular precision for optoelectronics and paves a practical route toward developing self&#8208;powered EC windows to offset the electricity consumption of buildings.

&lt;p&gt;Fully crystalline viologen-immobilized 2D polymer (&lt;b&gt;V2DP&lt;/b&gt;) film is synthesized, which enables high utilization of viologen moieties and fast ion transport. On this basis, the as-fabricated &lt;b&gt;V2DP&lt;/b&gt;-based ECDs exhibit a rapid switching speed, and a high coloration efficiency (989 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; C&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Furthermore, the highly efficient &lt;b&gt;V2DP&lt;/b&gt; ECDs are vertically integrated with transparent solar cells, thereby generating energy-saving EC window systems.

&lt;p&gt;Electrochromic devices (ECDs) have emerged as a unique class of optoelectronic devices for the development of smart windows.

As a result, the as-fabricated ECDs achieve a rapid switching speed (coloration, 2.8 s; bleaching, 1.2 s), and a high CE (989 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; C&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), and low energy consumption (21.1 &#181;W cm&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;).

         <title>Synergistic Modulation of the Separation of Photo&#8208;Generated Carries via Engineering of Dual Atomic Sites for Promoting Photocatalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu single atoms anchored on S doped polymeric carbon nitride (p&#8208;CN) photocatalyst is designed for photo&#8208;oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran under visible light irradiation. The construction of dual atomic sites of Cu&#8208;N4 and C&#8208;S&#8208;C in Cu SAs/p&#8208;CNS facilitates the separation of photo&#8208;generated carriers and thus enhances the photocatalytic activity.








Abstract
The separation efficiency of photo&#8208;generated carriers is still a great challenge that restricts the practical application of photocatalytic technology. The design of spatial separation path for photo&#8208;generated carriers at atomic level provides an innovative approach to address this challenge. Herein, a facile dual atomic sites strategy, consisting of Cu&#8208;N4 and C&#8208;S&#8208;C active moieties decorated on polymeric carbon nitride (Cu SAs/p&#8208;CNS) is reported to simultaneously achieve the highly efficient separation of photo&#8208;generated electrons and holes for boosting photocatalytic performance. As a proof of concept, the Cu SAs/p&#8208;CNS is successfully applied to the photo&#8208;oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF), which exhibits 77.1% HMF conversion and 85.6% DFF selectivity under visible light irradiation. The activity is considerably higher than that of bulk p&#8208;CN, S doped p&#8208;CN, and p&#8208;CN supported Cu single atom catalysts. Theoretical calculations and experimental results suggest that, during photocatalytic reaction, the isolated Cu&#8208;N4 sites directly capture photo&#8208;generated electrons, while the surrounding S atoms bear photo&#8208;generated holes, which synergistically facilitates the separation of photo&#8208;generated carriers and thus results in enhanced photocatalytic activity. This study provides a new perspective for the rational design of high performance photocatalysts at atomic level.

         <title>Polymorphic Phases of Metal Chlorides in the Confined 2D Space of Bilayer Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal chlorides intercalated in the van der Waals gap of bilayer graphene are found having polymorphic phases for the first time. New phases and phase transformation of AlCl3, as well as new hybrid alloy of quasi&#8208;1D AlCl3 and CuCl2 are directly observed by scanning transmission electron microscopy.








Abstract
Unprecedented 2D metal chloride structures are grown between sheets of bilayer graphene through intercalation of metal and chlorine atoms. Numerous spatially confined 2D phases of AlCl3 and CuCl2 distinct from their typical bulk forms are found, and the transformations between these new phases under the electron beam are directly observed by in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The density functional theory calculations confirm the metastability of the atomic structures derived from the STEM experiments and provide insights into the electronic properties of the phases, which range from insulators to semimetals. Additionally, the co&#8208;intercalation of different metal chlorides is found to create completely new hybrid systems; in&#8208;plane quasi&#8208;1D AlCl3/CuCl2 heterostructures are obtained. The existence of polymorphic phases hints at the unique possibilities for fabricating new types of 2D materials with diverse electronic properties confined between graphene sheets.

         <title>Gradient H&#8208;Bonding Binder Enables Stable High&#8208;Areal&#8208;Capacity Si&#8208;Based Anodes in Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gradient H&#8208;bonding polymer binder for Si&#8208;based anodes is reported, where the H&#8208;bond energies are regulated in a wide range. The well&#8208;defined gradient hydrogen bonds can effectively release the stress and maintain the integrity of electrode via the sequential bonding cleavage. Additionally, a 2 Ah pouch cell with an impressive capacity retention makes this binder more promising for practical application.








Abstract
Alleviating large stress is critical for high&#8208;energy batteries with large volume change upon cycling, yet this still presents a challenge. Here, a gradient hydrogen&#8208;bonding binder is reported for high&#8208;capacity silicon&#8208;based anodes that are highly desirable for the next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The well&#8208;defined gradient hydrogen bonds, with a successive bond energy of &#8722;2.88&#8211; &#8722;10.04&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1, can effectively release the large stress of silicon via the sequential bonding cleavage. This can avoid recurrently abrupt structure fracture of traditional binder due to lack of gradient energy dissipation. Certainly, this regulated binder endows stable high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity silicon&#8208;based electrodes &gt;4 mAh cm&#8722;2. Beyond proof of concept, this work demonstrates a 2 Ah silicon&#8208;based pouch cell with an impressive capacity retention of 80.2% after 700 cycles (0.028% decay/cycle) based on this gradient hydrogen&#8208;bonding binder, making it more promising for practical application.

Abstract
Because of concerns regarding shortages of lithium resources, and the urgent need to develop low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;efficiency energy storage systems, research and applications of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have re&#8208;emerged in recent years. In this review, recent advances in high&#8208;capacity Sn&#8208;based anode materials for stable SIBs are highlighted, including tin (Sn) alloys, Sn oxides, Sn sulfides, Sn selenides, Sn phosphides and their composites. The reaction mechanisms between Sn&#8208;based materials and sodium are clarified. Multiphase and multiscale structural optimizations of Sn&#8208;based materials to achieve good sodium storage performance are emphasized. Full&#8208;cell designs using Sn&#8208;based materials as anodes and further development of Sn&#8208;based materials are discussed from a commercialization perspective. This review provides insight into the preparation of future high&#8208;performance Sn&#8208;based anode materials and the construction of sodium&#8208;ion full batteries with a high energy density and long service life.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Cu2O Mesh Pattern on High Facet Cu Surface for Selective CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Although the electro&#8208;conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into ethanol is considered to be one of the most promising ways of using CO2, the ethanol selectivity is less than 50% because of difficulties in designing an optimal catalyst that arise from the complicated pathways for the electro&#8208;reduction of CO2 to ethanol. Several approaches including the fabrication of oxide&#8208;derived structures, atomic surface control, and the Cu+/Cu interfaces, have been primarily used to produce ethanol from CO2. Here, we constructed a combined structure with Cu+ and high&#8208;facets as electrocatalysts by creating high&#8208;facets of wrinkled Cu surrounded by Cu2O mesh patterns. Using chemical vapor deposition graphene growth procedures, we used the insufficiently grown graphene as oxidation masking materials, and we simultaneously generated the high&#8208;facet wrinkled Cu during the graphene growth synthesis. The resulting electrocatalyst showed an ethanol selectivity of 43% at &#8722;0.8&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, which is one of the highest ethanol selectivity values reported thus far. This is attributed to the role of Cu+ in enhancing CO binding strength and the high&#8208;facets, which favor C&#8211;C coupling and ethanol pathway. This method for generating the combined structure can be widely applicable not only for electrochemical catalysts but also in various fields.

         <title>Influence of Molecular Weight on the Organic Electrochemical Transistor Performance of Ladder&#8208;Type Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) hold promises for developing a variety of high&#8208;performance (bio&#8208;)electronic devices/circuits. While OECTs based on p&#8208;type semiconductors have achieved tremendous progress in recent years, n&#8208;type OECTs still suffer from low performance, hampering the development of power&#8208;efficient electronics. Here, we demonstrate that fine&#8208;tuning the molecular weight of the rigid, ladder&#8208;type n&#8208;type polymer poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL) by only one order of magnitude (from 4.9 to 51&#160;kDa) enables the development of n&#8208;type OECTs with record&#8208;high geometry&#8208;normalized transconductance (gm,norm &#8776; 11 S cm&#8211;1) and electron mobility &#215; volumetric capacitance (&#956;C* &#8776; 26 F cm&#8211;1&#160;V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1), fast temporal response (0.38&#160;ms), and low threshold voltage (0.15&#160;V). We ascribed this enhancement in OECT performance to a more efficient intermolecular charge transport in high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight BBL than the low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight counterpart. We also demonstrate OECT&#8208;based complementary inverters with record&#8208;high voltage gains of up to 100&#160;V/V and ultra&#8208;low power consumption down to 0.32 nW, depending on the supply voltage, which are among the best sub&#8208;1V&#160;complementary inverters reported to date. These findings demonstrate the importance of molecular weight in optimizing the OECT performance of rigid organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors and open for a new generation of power&#8208;efficient organic (bio&#8208;)electronic devices.

         <title>Bimetallic Janus Nanocrystals: Syntheses and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic Janus nanocrystals feature a side&#8208;by&#8208;side arrangement of two distinct metals divided by a heterogeneous interface. This unique structure allows one to present both metals on the same particle while tailoring the plasmonic coupling and electronic interaction between them, making the structure particularly viable for plasmonic, catalytic, and photocatalytic applications.








Abstract
Bimetallic Janus nanocrystals have received considerable interest in recent years owing to their unique properties and niche applications. The side&#8208;by&#8208;side distribution of two distinct metals provides a flexible platform for tailoring the optical and catalytic properties of nanocrystals. First, a brief introduction to the structural features of bimetallic Janus nanocrystals, followed by an extensive discussion of the synthetic approaches, is given. The strategies and experimental controls for achieving the Janus structure, as well as the mechanistic understandings, are specifically discussed. Then, a number of intriguing properties and applications enabled by the Janus nanocrystals are highlighted. Finally, this article is concluded with future directions and outlooks with respect to both syntheses and applications of this new class of functional nanomaterials.

         <title>Suppressing High&#8208;Current&#8208;Induced Phase Separation in Ni&#8208;Rich Layered Oxides by Electrochemically Manipulating Dynamic Lithium Distribution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, it is demonstrated that the fast&#8208;charging&#8208;induced phase transformation pathways are controlled by the solid&#8208;state lithium diffusion kinetics in a conventional Ni&#8208;rich layered oxide cathode. Electrochemical manipulation of the initial lithium concentration and distribution within a particle redirects the phase transformation of the Ni&#8208;rich layered oxide cathode and enables the solid&#8208;solution pathway during extreme fast charging.








Abstract
Understanding the cycling rate&#8208;dependent kinetics is crucial for managing the performance of batteries in high&#8208;power applications. Although high cycling rates may induce reaction heterogeneity and affect battery lifetime and capacity utilization, such phase transformation dynamics are poorly understood and uncontrollable. In this study, synchrotron&#8208;based operando X&#8208;ray diffraction is performed to monitor the high&#8208;current&#8208;induced phase transformation kinetics of LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2. The sluggish Li diffusion at high Li content induces different phase transformations during charging and discharging, with strong phase separation and homogeneous phase transformation during charging and discharging, respectively. Moreover, by exploiting the dependence of Li diffusivity on the Li content and electrochemically tuning the initial Li content and distribution, phase separation pathway can be redirected to solid solution kinetics at a high charging rate of 7 C. Finite element analysis further elucidates the effect of the Li&#8208;content&#8208;dependent diffusion kinetics on the phase transformation pathway. The findings suggest a new direction for optimizing fast&#8208;cycling protocols based on the intrinsic properties of the materials.

         <title>Ultrafast Digital Fabrication of Designable Architectured Liquid Crystalline Elastomer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrafast (25 s) and remotely controllable digital method is reported to fabricate complex liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) without any physical alignment templates. Inspired by the cooperative actions of muscles, diverse motions of LCE are realized through the combination of different architectures. The architectured design offers a new dimension for preparing functionally diverse soft machines.








Abstract
The muscle&#8208;like activities of liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) offer great potential for designing future soft machines. Their motion complexity, however, relies on inflexible and cumbersome mesogen alignment techniques. Here, a digital photocuring method for ultrafast template&#8208;free fabrication of LCE artificial muscles capable of designable complex motions is reported. This method utilizes the intrinsic light attenuation in the through&#8208;plane direction to create mesogen alignment for reversible bending action. To turn this simple actuation into complex motions, the principles of muscles are borrowed which realize diverse motions through the cooperative actions of otherwise simple contraction/expansion of individual muscle bundles. Specifically, the spatiotemporal digital light is utilized to design LCE architectures composed of strategically arranged bending modules. As such, LCE capable of highly designable motions can be fabricated within 25 s light curing without employing any physical alignment templates, which offers an attractive option toward designing functionally diverse soft machines.

         <title>Manipulating Color Emission in 2D Hybrid Perovskites by Fine Tuning Halide Segregation: A Transparent Green Emitter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled halide substitution in low&#8208;dimensional hybrid perovskites is an effective strategy to vary the material bandgap, obtaining a palette of light emitters, whereby transparent thin films emitting in the green are realized. By fine&#8208;tuning the halide content, nanoscale phase segregation happens, resulting in a controlled nanoscale spatial distribution of recombination centers.








Abstract
Halide perovskite materials offer an ideal playground for easily tuning their color and, accordingly, the spectral range of their emitted light. In contrast to common procedures, this work demonstrates that halide substitution in Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites not only progressively modulates the bandgap, but it can also be a powerful tool to control the nanoscale phase segregation&#8212;by adjusting the halide ratio and therefore the spatial distribution of recombination centers. As a result, thin films of chloride&#8208;rich perovskite are engineered&#8212;which appear transparent to the human eye&#8212;with controlled tunable emission in the green. This is due to a rational halide substitution with iodide or bromide leading to a spatial distribution of phases where the minor component is responsible for the tunable emission, as identified by combined hyperspectral photoluminescence imaging and elemental mapping. This work paves the way for the next generation of highly tunable transparent emissive materials, which can be used as light&#8208;emitting pixels in advanced and low&#8208;cost optoelectronics.

         <title>Dynamic Polymer Amphiphiles for Efficient Intracellular and In Vivo Protein Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of dynamic polymer supra&#8208;amphiphiles for intracellular protein delivery is reported. The prepared super&#8208;amphiphiles can be coassembled with proteins to form stable nanoparticles, which can promote the effective intracellular delivery process of multiple proteins due to their dynamic features and show great potency in the delivery of superoxide dismutase to treat ulcerative colitis in vivo.








Abstract
Intracellular delivery of proteins is receiving considerable attention in biotherapeutics for various diseases by replacing dysfunctional proteins. Successful intracellular protein delivery highly relies on the development of efficient and safe polymeric carriers, which remains a grand challenge due to the lack of strong binding sites on proteins and their distinct molecular sizes and polarities. In this work, a strategy is proposed for efficient intracellular protein delivery by using dynamic polymer supra&#8208;amphiphiles, which are prepared by grafting boronated polylysine with a series of lipidated catechols via dynamic covalent catechol&#8211;boronate ester bonds. The prepared supra&#8208;amphiphiles can coassemble with proteins to form stable nanoparticles in water and also enable the release of bound proteins in cells due to their dynamic features, thereby strongly promoting the intracellular delivery process. The lead supra&#8208;amphiphiles screened in the library demonstrate high efficiency in the delivery of various proteins including bovine serum albumin, &#946;&#8208;galactosidase, &#945;&#8208;chymotrypsin, saporin, R&#8208;phycoerythrin, ovalbumin, catalase, and superoxide dismutase, and show great potency in delivering superoxide dismutase to treat ulcerative colitis in vivo. This work provides new opportunities for rational design and facile construction of robust intracellular protein delivery materials by the integration of polymer chemistry and supramolecular engineering strategies.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Thermal Switching of Individual Plasmonically Activated Spin Crossover Nanoparticle Imaged by Ultrafast Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrafast electron microscopy study shows how individual spin crossover nanoparticle, with different number of embedded gold nanorods, acts as an efficient photoswitch where the size of the particle can be controlled within less than 20&#160;ns.








Abstract
Spin crossover (SCO) is a promising switching phenomenon when implemented in electronic devices as molecules, thin films or nanoparticles. Among the properties modulated along this phenomenon, optically induced mechanical changes are of tremendous importance as they can work as fast light&#8208;induced mechanical switches or allow to investigate and control microstructural strains and fatigability. The development of characterization techniques probing nanoscopic behavior with high spatio&#8208;temporal resolution allows to trigger and visualize such mechanical changes of individual nanoscopic objects. Here, ultrafast transmission electron microscopy (UTEM) is used to precisely probe the length changes of individual switchable nanoparticles induced thermally by nanosecond laser pulses. This allows revealing of the mechanisms of spin switching, leading to the macroscopic expansion of SCO materials. This study is conducted on individual pure SCO nanoparticles and SCO nanoparticles encapsulating gold nanorods that serve for plasmonic heating under laser pulses. Length changes are compared with time&#8208;resolved optical measurements performed on an assembly of these particles.

         <title>Recent Advances in Fluorinated Graphene from Synthesis to Applications: Critical Review on Functional Chemistry and Structure Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent advances in fluorinated graphene (FG) from the synthesis methods to the broad applications and the relationship between the structures and properties are reviewed in detail. Especially, rational structure engineering and the abundant functional chemistry are the significant directions which are further discussed for the future development of FG.








Abstract
Fluorinated graphene (FG), as an emerging member of the graphene derivatives family, has attracted wide attention on account of its excellent performances and underlying applications. The introduction of a fluorine atom, with the strongest electronegativity (3.98), greatly changes the electron distribution of graphene, resulting in a series of unique variations in optical, electronic, magnetic, interfacial properties and so on. Herein, recent advances in the study of FG from synthesis to applications are introduced, and the relationship between its structure and properties is summarized in detail. Especially, the functional chemistry of FG has been thoroughly analyzed in recent years, which has opened a universal route for the functionalization and even multifunctionalization of FG toward various graphene derivatives, which further broadens its applications. Moreover, from a particular angle, the structure engineering of FG such as the distribution pattern of fluorine atoms and the regulation of interlayer structure when advanced nanotechnology gets involved is summarized. Notably, the elaborated structure engineering of FG is the key factor to optimize the corresponding properties for potential applications, and is also an up&#8208;to&#8208;date research hotspot and future development direction. Finally, perspectives and prospects for the problems and challenges in the study of FG are put forward.

         <title>Emerging Electrocatalysts for Water Oxidation under Near&#8208;Neutral CO2 Reduction Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent theoretical and experimental development of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts under near pH&#8208;neutral CO2 reduction conditions is reviewed and future opportunities are discussed. These electrocatalysts range from noble&#8208;metal oxides to nonprecious metal phosphides, carbonates, and (hydro)oxides. Density functional theory, and particularly machine learning, and operando characterizations are also included.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), which produces valuable fuels and chemicals under near&#8208;neutral conditions, offers a renewable approach to alleviate the global energy crisis as well as the increasing concerns on climate change. However, to implement this strategy, one of the major challenges, the sluggish kinetics of the paired oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at anode, needs to be surmounted. It is therefore highly desirable to explore high&#8208;performance and cost&#8208;effective OER electrocatalysts suitable for CO2RR conditions, which is very different from those widely investigated under acidic or alkaline conditions. In this review, the ongoing development of OER electrocatalysts under near pH&#8208;neutral CO2&#8208;saturated (bi)carbonate solutions are highlighted and the future opportunities are discussed. It is started with a brief introduction on OER paired with CO2RR, the relevant theoretical tools such as density functional theory (DFT) and particularly machine learning (ML), and the operando characterization techniques. Then, there are some detailed discussions of recent progress on the rational design of OER electrocatalysts under CO2RR conditions ranging from noble&#8208;metal oxides to nonprecious metal phosphides, carbonates, (hydro)oxides, and so on. Finally, a perspective for developing OER electrocatalysts integrated with CO2 electroreduction is proposed.

         <title>Electron and Ion Co&#8208;Conductive Catalyst Achieving Instant Transformation of Lithium Polysulfide towards Li2S</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique electron and ion co&#8208;conductive catalyst of carbon coated Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 (C@LATP) composite electrolyte has been developed, which can synchronously provide both Li&#8208;ions and electrons for the conversion reaction of LiPSs. The conversion reaction path of lithium polysulfide (LiPSs) using C@LATP changes from traditional &#8220;adsorption&#8208;diffusion&#8208;conversion&#8221; to novel &#8220;adsorption&#8208;conversion&#8221;, which effectively promotes the instant conversion reaction of LiPSs to Li2S.








Abstract
Most of the catalysts in lithium sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries present low electronic conductivity and the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) must diffuse onto the surface of the carbon materials to achieve their conversion reaction. It is a significant challenge to achieve the instantaneous transformation of LiPSs to Li2S in Li&#8211;S batteries to suppress the shuttle effect of LiPSs. Herein, a unique electron and ion co&#8208;conductive catalyst of carbon&#8208;coated Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 (C@LATP) is developed, which not only possesses strong adsorption to LiPSs, but, more importantly, also promotes the instantaneous conversion reaction of LiPSs to Li2S. The C@LATP nanoparticles as catalytic active sites can synchronously and efficiently provide both Li ions and electrons to facilitate the conversion reaction of LiPSs. The conversion reaction path of LiPSs using C@LATP changes from traditional &#8220;adsorption&#8211;diffusion&#8211;conversion&#8221; to novel &#8220;adsorption&#8211;conversion,&#8221; which effectively lowers the decomposition barrier of Li2S6 and promotes faster conversion of LiPSs. The shuttle effect of LiPSs is considerably suppressed and utilization of sulfur is greatly improved. The Li&#8211;S batteries using C@LATP present excellent rate, cycling, and self&#8208;discharge properties. This work highlights the significance of electron and ion co&#8208;conductive solid&#8208;state electrolytes for the instantaneous transformation of LiPSs in advanced Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Plasmonic Amyloid Tactoids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid liquid crystalline tactoids consisting of gold nanorods aligned by amyloid fibrils exhibit enhanced fluorescence with polarization and wavelength sensitivity. This work demonstrates how anisotropic colloidal self&#8208;assembly couples plasmonic nanoparticles with the intrinsic photonical properties of amyloids.








Abstract
Despite their link to neurodegenerative diseases, amyloids of natural and synthetic sources can also serve as building blocks for functional materials, while possessing intrinsic photonic properties. Here, it is demonstrated that orientationally ordered amyloid fibrils exhibit polarization&#8208;dependent fluorescence, and can mechanically align rod&#8208;shaped plasmonic nanoparticles codispersed with them. The coupling between the photonic fibrils in liquid crystalline phases and the plasmonic effect of the nanoparticles leads to selective activation of plasmonic extinctions as well as enhanced fluorescence from the hybrid material. These findings are consistent with numerical simulations of the near&#8208;field plasmonic enhancement around the nanoparticles. The study provides an approach to synthesize the intrinsic photonic and mechanical properties of amyloid into functional hybrid materials, and may help improve the detection of amyloid deposits based on their enhanced intrinsic luminescence.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Friction MSCs Delivery system improves the therapy for severe osteoarthritis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a musculoskeletal disorder disease affecting about 500 million people worldwide and Mesenchymal Sem Cells (MSCs) therapy has been demonstrated as a potential strategy to treat OA. However, the shear forces during direct injection and the harsher shear condition of OA environments would lead to significant cell damage and inhibit the therapeutic efficacy. Herein, DNA supramolecular hydrogel has been applied as delivering material for MSCs to treat severe OA model, which perform extraordinary protection in MSCs against the shear force both in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate the DNA supramolecular hydrogel could promote formation of quality cartilage, reduce osteophyte and normalize subchondral bone under the high friction condition of OA, whose molecular mechanisms underlying therapeutic effects are also investigated. It can be anticipated that DNA supramolecular hydrogel would be a promising cell delivery system for multiple potential MSCs therapy.

         <title>Tailoring competitive adsorption sites by oxygen&#8208;vacancy on cobalt oxides to enhance the electrooxidation of biomass</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The electrooxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) offers a promising green route to attain high&#8208;value chemicals from biomass. The HMF electrooxidation reaction (HMFOR) is a complicated process involving the combined adsorption and coupling of organic molecules and OH&#8722; on the electrode surface. An in&#8208;depth understanding of these adsorption sites and reaction processes on electrocatalysts is fundamentally important. Herein, the adsorption behavior of HMF and OH&#8722;, and the role of oxygen vacancy on Co3O4 are initially unraveled. Correspondingly, instead of the competitive adsorption of OH&#8722; and HMF on the metal sites, it is observed that the OH&#8722; could fill into oxygen vacancy (Vo) in prior to couple with organic molecules through lattice oxygen oxidation reaction process, which could accelerate the rate&#8208;determining step of the dehydrogenation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA) intermediates. With the modulated adsorption sites, the as&#8208;designed Vo&#8208;Co3O4 shows excellent activity for HMFOR with the earlier potential of 90&#160;mV and 120&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 1 M KOH and 1 M PBS solution. This work sheds a depth insight on the catalytic mechanism of oxygen vacancy, which benefits designing a novel electrocatalysts to modulate the multi&#8208;molecules combined adsorption behaviors.

         <title>Air&#8208;Stable Two&#8208;Dimensional Cr5Te8 Nanosheets with Thickness&#8208;Tunable Ferromagnetism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) magnetic materials have aroused widespread research interest owing to their promising application in spintronic devices. However, exploring new kinds of 2D magnetic materials with better stability and realizing their batch synthesis remain challenging. Herein, we report the synthesis of air&#8208;stable 2D Cr5Te8 ultrathin crystals with tunable thickness via tube&#8208;in&#8208;tube chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth technology. We highlight the importance of tube&#8208;in&#8208;tube CVD growth, which can significantly suppress the equilibrium shift to the decomposition direction and facilitate that to the synthesis reaction direction, for the synthesis of high&#8208;quality Cr5Te8 with accurate composition. By precisely adjusting the growth temperature, the thickness of Cr5Te8 nanosheets was tuned from &#8764;1.2&#160;nm to tens of nanometers, with the morphology changing from triangle to hexagon. Furthermore, magneto&#8208;optical Kerr effect measurements reveal that the Cr5Te8 nanosheet is ferromagnetic with strong out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin polarization. The Curie temperature exhibits a monotonic increase from 100 to 160 K as the Cr5Te8 thickness increases from 10 to 30&#160;nm and no apparent variation in surface roughness or magnetic properties after months of exposure to air. This study provides a robust method for the controllable synthesis of high&#8208;quality 2D ferromagnetic materials, which will facilitate research progress in spintronics.

         <title>Designing Artificial Vibration Modes of Piezoelectric Devices Using Programmable, 3D Ordered Structure with Piezoceramic Strain Units</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Piezoelectric ceramic devices, which utilize multifarious vibration modes to realize electromechanical coupling and energy conversions, are extensively used in high&#8208;technological fields. However, the excitation of basic modes is mainly subjected to natural eigenfrequency of ceramic devices, which is related to the structure and material parameters. Herein, inspired by metamaterial theory, a programmable, 3D ordered structure with piezoceramic strain units (3D OSPSU) is developed to artificially generate basic modes in a broad frequency band other than only in narrow eigenfrequency. A (2 &#215; 2 &#215; 2) arrayed, co&#8208;fired multilayer 3D OSPSU is painstakingly designed and fabricated for generating basic modes, such as flexural, extension, shear, torsion, and even coupled modes at non&#8208;resonance. To validate the 3D OSPSU method, a five&#8208;degree&#8208;of&#8208;freedom micro&#8208;nano actuating platform based on only one co&#8208;fired multilayer ceramic is constructed. The proposed methodology provides a new paradigm for creating extraordinary material properties of piezoelectric ceramics and will inspire brand&#8208;new piezoelectric device designs.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Based Hydrogen Release Platform for Multi&#8208;Effective Helicobacter Pylori Targeting Therapy and Intestinal Flora Protective Capabilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is the leading cause of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer and gastric cancer. Antibiotics, as traditional method for eliminating H. pylori, have no targeting effect, which cause serious bacterial resistance and gut dysbacteriosis. Moreover, antibiotics can hardly address hyperactive inflammatory response or damaged gastric mucosal barrier caused by H. pylori infection. Here, we report a pH&#8208;responsive metal&#8208;organic framework hydrogen generation nanoparticle (Pd(H)@ZIF&#8208;8), which is encapsulated with ascorbate palmitate (AP) hydrogel. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that the outer AP hydrogel can target and adhere to the inflammatory site through electrostatic interaction, and is then hydrolyzed by matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) enriching in inflammatory sites. The released Pd(H)@ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles are further decomposed by gastric acid to generate zinc ions (Zn2+) and hydrogen, thus effectively killing H. pylori, alleviating inflammation and restoring impaired gastric mucosa simultaneously. Unexpectedly, this metal&#8208;organic framework hydrogen generation platform (Pd(H)@ZIF&#8208;8@AP) also has an inappreciable impact toward intestinal flora, which thus provides a more precise, effective and healthy strategy for the treatment of H. pylori infection.

         <title>Dynamic Ligand Screening by Magnetic Nanoassembly Modulates Stem Cell Differentiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In native microenvironment, diverse physical barriers exist to dynamically modulate stem cell recruitment and differentiation for tissue repair. In this study, we utilize nanoassembly&#8208;based magnetic screens of various sizes and elastically tethered them over RGD ligand (cell&#8208;adhesive motif)&#8208;presenting material surface to generate various nano&#8208;gaps between the screens and the RGDs without modulating the RGD density. Large screens exhibiting low RGD distribution stimulate integrin clustering to facilitate focal adhesion, mechanotransduction, and differentiation of stem cells, which were not observed with small screens. Magnetic downward pulling of the large screens decreases nano&#8208;gaps, which dynamically suppress the focal adhesion, mechanotransduction, and differentiation of stem cells. Conversely, magnetic upward pulling of the small screens increases the nano&#8208;gaps, which dynamically activate focal adhesion, mechanotransduction, and differentiation of stem cells. This regulation mechanism was also shown to be effective in the microenvironment in vivo. Further diversifying geometries of the physical screens could further enable diverse modalities of multifaceted and safe unscreening of the distributed RGDs to unravel and modulate stem cell differentiation for tissue repair.

Abstract
Plasmonic photocatalysis has received much attention owing to attractive plasmonic enhancement effects in improving the solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency. However, the photocatalytic efficiencies have remained low mainly due to the short carrier lifetime caused by the rapid recombination of plasmon&#8208;generated hot charge carriers. Although plasmonic metal&#8211;semiconductor heterostructures can improve the separation of hot charge carriers, a large portion of the hot charge carriers are lost when they cross the Schottky barrier. Herein a Schottky&#8208;barrier&#8208;free plasmonic semiconductor photocatalyst, MoO3&#8208;x, which allows for efficient N2 photofixation in a &#8220;one&#8208;stone&#8208;two&#8208;birds&#8221; manner, is demonstrated. The oxygen vacancies in MoO3&#8208;x serve as the &#8220;stone&#8221;. They &#8220;kill two birds&#8221; by functioning as the active sites for the chemisorption of N2 molecules and inducing localized surface plasmon resonance for the generation of hot charge carriers. Benefiting from this unique strategy, plasmonic MoO3&#8208;x exhibits a remarkable photoreactivity for NH3 production up to the wavelength of 1064&#160;nm with apparent quantum efficiencies over 1%, and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion efficiency of 0.057% without any hole scavenger. This work shows the great potential of plasmonic semiconductors to be directly used for photocatalysis. The concept of the Schottky&#8208;barrier&#8208;free design will pave a new path for the rational design of efficient photocatalysts.

         <title>2D Piezoelectric Bi2MoO6 Nanoribbons for GSH&#8208;Enhanced Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As&#8208;constructed Bi2MoO6&#8208;poly(ethylene glycol) (BMO&#8208;PEG) nanoribbons (NRs) with piezoelectric properties provide a double&#8208;upgrading sonodynamic therapy. The BMO NRs consume endogenous glutathione (GSH) to disrupt redox homeostasis. Furthermore, it is discovered that the GSH&#8208;activated BMO NRs indicate a higher ultrasound (US)&#8208;triggered reactive oxygen species generation efficiency owing to internal oxygen defects, which predominantly trap electrons to delay the recombination of e&#8722;&#8211;h+ pairs. Unlike conventional sonosensitizers, ultrathin GSH&#8208;activated BMO NRs are piezoelectric, which can maximize the use of US energy to induce polarization, thereby facilitating e&#8722;&#8211;h+ separation and improving the efficiency of sonodynamic therapy.








Abstract
Reducing the scavenging capacity of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and elevating ROS production are two primary goals of developing novel sonosensitizers for sonodynamic therapy (SDT). Hence, ultrathin 2D Bi2MoO6&#8211;poly(ethylene glycol) nanoribbons (BMO NRs) are designed as piezoelectric sonosensitizers for glutathione (GSH)&#8208;enhanced SDT. In cancer cells, BMO NRs can consume endogenous GSH to disrupt redox homeostasis, and the GSH&#8208;activated BMO NRs (GBMO) exhibit an oxygen&#8208;deficient structure, which can promote the separation of electron&#8211;hole pairs, thereby enhancing the efficiency of ROS production in SDT. The ultrathin GBMO NRs are piezoelectric, in which ultrasonic waves introduce mechanical strain to the nanoribbons, resulting in piezoelectric polarization and band tilting, thus accelerating toxic ROS production. The as&#8208;synthesized BMO NRs enable excellent computed tomography imaging of tumors and significant tumor suppression in vitro and in vivo. A piezoelectric Bi2MoO6 sonosensitizer&#8208;mediated two&#8208;step enhancement SDT process, which is activated by endogenous GSH and amplified by exogenous ultrasound, is proposed. This process not only provides new options for improving SDT but also broadens the application of 2D piezoelectric materials as sonosensitizers in SDT.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Stable Dion&#8722;Jacobson Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by Extended &#960;&#8208;Conjugation of Organic Spacer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic spacer, namely TTDMAI, is successfully developed as spacers for 2D Dion&#8208;Jacobson perovskites. A champion efficiency of 18.82% is demonstrated due to the improved film quality and preferred crystal vertical orientation thanks to the templated grain growth by the large crystal nuclei size in precursor solution.








Abstract
2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ) perovskites have become an emerging photovoltaic material with excellent structure and environmental stability due to their lacking van der Waals gaps relative to 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites. Here, a fused&#8208;thiophene&#8208;based spacer, namely TTDMAI, is successfully developed for 2D DJ perovskite solar cells. It is found that the DJ perovskite using TTDMA spacer with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation length exhibits high film quality, large crystal size and preferred crystal vertical orientation induced by the large crystal nuclei in precursor solution, resulting in lower trap density, reduced exciton binding energy and oriented charge transport. As a result, the optimized 2D DJ perovskite device based on TTDMA (nominal n&#160;= 4) delivers a champion PCE up to 18.82%. Importantly, the unencapsulated device based on TTDMA can sustain average 99% of their original efficiency after being stored in N2 for 4400 h (over 6 months). Moreover, light, thermal, environmental and operational stabilities are also significantly improved in comparison with their 3D counterparts.

         <title>Natural Acidic Polysaccharide&#8208;Based Memristors for Transient Electronics: Highly Controllable Quantized Conductance for Integrated Memory and Nonvolatile Logic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural acidic polysaccharides are reported as promising materials to construct memristors for transient applications. The ion&#8208;confinement capability of acidic polysaccharides also enables atomic manipulation of conductive filament, which can produce 16 highly controllable and independent quantized conductance (QC) states. The controllable QC switching behavior is promising for integrated memory and nonvolatile logic applications.








Abstract
As a leading candidate for further memory and computing applications, memristors are being developed in an important direction of transient electronics. Herein, wafer&#8208;scale acidic polysaccharide thin films are reported as promising materials for memristors with remarkable transient characteristics. The memristor shows freestanding and lightweight features, and can be fully dissolved in deionized water within 3.5 s. More importantly, the ion&#8208;confinement capability of acidic polysaccharides where the cations can interact with the ionizable acid groups enables atomic manipulation of conductive filament. As a result, (i) a single device can produce 16 highly controllable and independent quantized conductance (QC) states with quasi&#8208;nonvolatile and nonvolatile characteristics and (ii) QC switching can be performed with ultrafast speed (2&#8211;5&#160;ns) and low energy consumption (0.6&#8211;16 pJ). These remarkable features make the memristor promising for fast, low&#8208;power, and high&#8208;density memory and computing applications. Based on QC switching, the encoding/decoding and nonvolatile basic Boolean logic are designed and implemented. More importantly, &#8220;stateful&#8221; material implication logic which is promising for future in&#8208;memory computing is demonstrated with QC switching. These results significantly advance acidic polysaccharides to develop nanodevices with quantum effects.

         <title>Ultralow Power Optical Synapses Based on MoS2 Layers by Indium&#8208;Induced Surface Charge Doping for Biomimetic Eyes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducting electron injection enhancement layers of indium, a synaptic device of indium (In)/molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) show ultralow power consumption of 68.9 aJ, short&#8208;term plasticity (STP) and long&#8208;term plasticity (LTP), good capability of transition between STP and LTP. Additionally, a biomimetic eye with a 5&#8201; &#215; &#8201;5 array of In/MoS2 synaptic devices are implemented and exhibited excellent image sensing and learning functions.








Abstract
Biomimetic eyes, with their excellent imaging functions such as large fields of view and low aberrations, have shown great potentials in the fields of visual prostheses and robotics. However, high power consumption and difficulties in device integration severely restrict their rapid development. In this study, an artificial synaptic device consisting of a molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) film coated with an electron injection enhanced indium (In) layer is proposed to increase the channel conductivity and reduce the power consumption. This artificial synaptic device achieves an ultralow power consumption of 68.9 aJ per spike, which is several hundred times lower than those of the optical artificial synapses reported in literature. Furthermore, the multilayer and polycrystalline MoS2 film shows persistent photoconductivity performance, effectively resulting in short&#8208;term plasticity, long&#8208;term plasticity, and their transitions between each other. A 5 &#215; 5 In/MoS2 synaptic device array is constructed into a hemispherical electronic retina, demonstrating its impressive image sensing and learning functions. This research provides a new methodology for effective control of artificial synaptic devices, which have great opportunities used in bionic retinas, robots, and visual prostheses.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Droplet Electricity Generator Achieves an Ultrahigh Output Over 100&#160;V Without Pre&#8208;Charging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A droplet electricity generator (DEG) combining interfacial effect and switch effect is proposed to achieve an ultrahigh output without pre&#8208;charging, and the working mechanism is explained based on an equivalent circuit model. Compared with traditional electrostatic induction (TEI) electricity generation, the output is directly improved by two orders of magnitude, which provides insightful perspective and lays a solid foundation for large&#8208;scale DEG applications.








Abstract
The working principle of the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), contact electrification and electrostatic induction, has been used to harvest raindrop energy in recent years. However, the existing research is mainly concentrated on solid&#8211;liquid electrification, and adopts traditional electrostatic induction (TEI) for output. As a result, the efficiency of droplet electricity generators (DEGs) is severely constrained. Therefore, previous studies deem that the DEG output is limited by interfacial effects. This study reveals that this view is inappropriate and, in reality, the output strategy is the key bottleneck restricting the DEG performance. Here, a switch effect based on an electric&#8208;double&#8208;layer capacitor (EDLC) is introduced, and an equivalent circuit model is established to understand its working mechanism. Without pre&#8208;charging, a single droplet can generate high voltage over 100&#160;V and the output is directly improved by two&#8208;orders of magnitude compared with TEI, which is precisely utilizing the interfacial effect. This work provides insightful perspective and lays solid foundation for DEG applications in large scale.

Abstract
Recently, flexible wearable electronic devices attract immense interest as an alternative for conventional rigid metallic conductors in personal healthcare monitoring, human motion detection, and sensory skins, owing to their intrinsic characteristics. However, the practical applications of most wearable sensors are generally limited by their poor stretchability and sensitivity, unsatisfied strength, lower conductivity, and single sensory function. Here a hydrogen bond cross&#8208;linked network based on carboxylic styrene butadiene rubber (XSBR) and hydrophilic sericin (SS) non&#8208;covalently modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is rationally designed and then fabricated into multi&#8208;functional sensors. The resultant versatile sensors are able to detect both weak and large deformations, which owns a low detection limit of 1% strain, high stretchability up to 217%, superior strength of 12.58&#160;MPa, highly sensitivity with a gauge factor up to 25.98, high conductivity of 0.071 S/m, and lower percolation threshold of 0.504 wt%. Moreover, the prepared sensors also possess satisfactory thermosensation (0.01636 &#8451;&#8211;1) and highly discernible temperature resolution (2.4 &#8451;), realizing the application in the measurement of human body temperature. The multifunctional and scalable XSBR/SSCNT sensor with the integrated tracking capabilities of real&#8208;time and in situ physiological signals, providing a promising route to develop wearable artificial intelligence in human health and sporting applications.

The resultant versatile sensors are able to detect both weak and large deformations, which owns a low detection limit of 1% strain, high stretchability up to 217%, superior strength of 12.58&#160;MPa, highly sensitivity with a gauge factor up to 25.98, high conductivity of 0.071 S/m, and lower percolation threshold of 0.504 wt%. Moreover, the prepared sensors also possess satisfactory thermosensation (0.01636 &#8451;&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and highly discernible temperature resolution (2.4 &#8451;), realizing the application in the measurement of human body temperature. The multifunctional and scalable XSBR/SSCNT sensor with the integrated tracking capabilities of real-time and in situ physiological signals, providing a promising route to develop wearable artificial intelligence in human health and sporting applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>The Quest for Stable Potassium&#8208;Ion Battery Chemistry</title>

Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) have attracted wide interests for energy storage because of the abundance of the electrode materials involved; however, their electrochemical performances are far behind what can be achieved from lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) or sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). This paper identifies key promising electrode and electrolyte materials for potassium&#8208;ion batteries, investigates the coupled electrochemical reactions in the cell, and demonstrates that the compatibility between different materials plays the most important role. K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] cathode can deliver a high capacity of &#8764;125 mAh g&#8211;1 and exceptional cycling stability over 61,000 cycles (&#8764;9 months) if the side reactions from the anode can be prevented. Graphite is a good anode material but is subjected to degradation in traditional carbonate electrolytes. New concentrated electrolytes are developed and evaluated. A stable KIB system is demonstrated by coupling a stable K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] cathode, a pre&#8208;potassiated graphite anode with a concentrated electrolyte to achieve a high energy density of &#8764;260&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1 (based on the active mass of cathode and anode) and good cycling of over 1000 cycles.

         <title>Over 21% Efficiency Stable Two&#8208;dimensional Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to the insufficient light absorption and charge transport, two&#8208;dimensional(2D) Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (RP) perovskites show the relatively low efficiency. Here, we fabricated the methylammonium(MA), formamidinum(FA) and FA/MA mixed 2D PSCs. Incorporating FA cations extends the absorption range and enhance the light absorption. Optical spectroscopy showed that FA cations substantially increased the portion of 3D&#8208;like phase to 2D phases, and XRD studies revealed that FA based 2D perovskite possessed an oblique crystal orientation. Nevertheless, the ultra&#8208;fast interphase charge transfer result in an extremely long carrier diffusion length (&#8764;1.98&#160;&#956;m). Also, chloride additives effectively suppress the yellow &#948;&#8208;phase formation of pure FA based 2D PSCs. As a result, both FA/MA mixed and pure FA based 2D PSCs exhibit a greatly enhanced PCE over 20%. Specifically, the pure FA based 2D PSCs achieved a record PCE of 21.07% (certified at 20%), which is the highest efficiency for low&#8208;dimensional PSCs (n&#8804;10) reported to date. Importantly, the FA based 2D PSCs retain 97% of its initial efficiency at 85&#176;C persistent heating after 1500&#160;hrs. Our results unambiguously demonstrate that pure FA based 2D PSCs are promising to achieve comparable efficiency to the 3D perovskite, along with a better device stability.

         <title>Anti&#8208;counterfeiting White Light Printed Image Multiplexing By Fast Nanosecond Laser Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Passive plasmonic metasurfaces enable image multiplexing by displaying different images when altering the conditions of observation. Under white light, three&#8208;image multiplexing with polarization selective switching has been recently demonstrated using femtosecond&#8208;laser&#8208;processed random plasmonic metasurfaces. Here, the implementation of image multiplexing is extended, thanks to a color search algorithm, to various observation modes compatible with naked&#8208;eye observation under incoherent white light and to four&#8208;image multiplexing under polarized light. The laser&#8208;processed random plasmonic metasurfaces enabling image multiplexing exhibit self&#8208;organized patterns that can diffract light or induce dichroism through hybridization between the localized surface plasmon resonance of metallic nanoparticles and a lattice resonance. Improved spatial resolution makes the image quality compatible with commercial use in secured documents, as well as the processing time and cost thanks to the use of a nanosecond laser. This high speed and flexible laser process, based on energy efficient nanoparticle reshaping and self&#8208;organization, produces centimeter&#8208;scale customized tamper&#8208;proof images at low cost, which can serve as overt security features.

Abstract
Epithelia are contiguous sheets of cells that stabilize the shape of internal organs and support their structure by covering their surfaces. They acquire diverse morphological forms appropriate for their specific functions during embryonic development, such as the kidney tubules and the complex branching structures found in the lung. The maintenance of epithelial morphogenesis and homeostasis is controlled by their remarkable mechanics&#8212;epithelia can become elastic, plastic, and viscous by actively remodelling cell&#8208;cell junctions and modulating the distribution of local stresses. We use microfabrication, finite element modelling, light&#8208;sheet microscopy, and robotic micromanipulation to show that collagen gels covered with an epithelial skin serve as shape&#8208;programmable soft matter. The process involves solid to fluid transitions induced by mechanical perturbations, generates spatially distributed surface stresses at tissue interfaces, and is amenable to both additive and subtractive manufacturing techniques. We demonstrate the robustness and versatility of this strategy for engineering designer tissues by directing the morphogenesis of a variety of moulded, carved, and assembled forms from the base material. The results provide insight into the active mechanical properties of the epithelia and establish methods for engineering tissues with sustainable architectures.

         <title>Ratiometric FRET encoded Hierarchical ZrMOF@Au Cluster for Ultrasensitive Quantifying MicroRNA in vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Here, ZrMOF@Au cluster architectures have been fabricated and then functionalized with two fluorescent dyes (Quasar [QS] and Cy5.5) through DNA hybridization, to form fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) encoded ZrMOF@Au&#8208;QS/Cy5.5 complex. In the presence of the target intracellular microRNA (miR)&#8208;21, the fluorescence of Cy5.5 at 705&#160;nm (F705) decreased and the fluorescence of QS at 665&#160;nm (F665) increased when Cy5.5 was released from the surface of ZrMOF@Au&#8211;QS/Cy5.5. The change in the fluorescence ratio (F705/F665) showed an outstanding linear range of 0.006&#8211;67.9 amol/ngRNA, and the limit of detection was 4.51 zmol/ngRNA in living cells. The high ratio loading of nucleic acid on surface of ZrMOF@Au cluster and two fluorescence encoded signal enabled better sensitivity and reliability. Zeptomolar sensitivity and good linearity against target affords distinct imaging&#8208;based monitoring of cancer marker miR&#8208;21 both in living cells and in vivo. At the same time, the architecture displayed remarkable photothermal conversion efficiency (53.7%) and give rise to outstanding therapy ability in vivo. This strategy offers new avenues for the intelligent quantification of miRNAs for simultaneous diagnoses and treatments of early&#8208;stage cancers.

         <title>Structures and Materials in Stretchable Electroluminescent Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Stretchable electroluminescent (EL) devices have been obtained by partitioning a large emission area into areas specifically for stretching and light&#8208;emission (island&#8208;bridge structure). Buckled and textile structures have also been shown effective to combine the conventional light emitting diode fabrication with elastic substrates for structure&#8208;enabled stretchable EL devices. Meanwhile, intrinsically stretchable EL devices which are characterized with uniform stretchability down to microscopic scale are relatively less developed but promise simpler device structure and higher impact resistance. The challenges in fabricating intrinsically stretchable EL devices with high and robust performance are in many facets, including stretchable conductors, emissive materials, and compatible processes. For the stretchable transparent electrode, ionically conductive gel, conductive polymer coating, and conductor network in surface of elastomer have all been proven useful. The stretchable EL materials are currently limited to conjugated polymers, conjugated polymers with surfactants and ionic conductors added to boost stretchability, and phosphor particles embedded in elastomer matrices. These emissive materials operate under different mechanisms, require different electrode materials and fabrication processes, and the corresponding EL devices face distinctive challenges. This review aims to provide a basic understanding of the materials meeting both the mechanical and electronic requirements and important techniques to fabricate the stretchable EL devices.

         <title>Doping&#8208;Induced Dielectric Catastrophe Prompts Free&#8208;Carrier Release in Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The control over material properties attainable through molecular doping is essential to many technological applications of organic semiconductors, such as OLED or thermoelectrics. These excitonic semiconductors typically reach the degenerate limit only at impurity concentrations of 5&#8208;10%, a phenomenon that has been put in relation with the strong Coulomb binding between charge carriers and ionized dopants, and whose comprehension remained elusive so far. This study proposes a general mechanism for the release of carriers at finite doping in terms of collective screening phenomena. A multiscale model for the dielectric properties of doped organic semiconductor is set up by combining first principles and microelectrostatic calculations. Our results predict a large nonlinear enhancement of the dielectric constant (ten&#8208;fold at 8% load) as the system approaches a dielectric instability (catastrophe) upon increasing doping. This can be attributed to the presence of highly polarizable host&#8208;dopant complexes, plus a nontrivial leading contribution from dipolar interactions in the disordered and heterogeneous system. The enhanced screening in the material drastically reduces the (free) energy barriers for electron&#8208;hole separation, rationalizing the possibility for thermal charge release. The proposed mechanism is consistent with conductivity data and sets the basis for achieving higher conductivities at lower doping loads.

         <title>A Universal Non&#8208;halogenated Polymer Donor for High&#8208;performance Organic Photovoltaic Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Non&#8208;halogenated polymers have great potential in commercialization of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells due to their advantage in low&#8208;cost preparation. However, non&#8208;halogenated polymers usually have high HOMO energy levels and inferior self&#8208;aggregation properties in solution, thus resulting in low power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Herein, two non&#8208;halogenated polymers, PB1 and PB2, are prepared. When the polymers were used to fabricate OPV cells with the BTP&#8208;eC9, the PB1&#8208;based device only gave a PCE of 5.3%, while the PB2&#8208;based device showed an outstanding PCE of 17.7%. After the introduction of PBDB&#8208;TF as the third component, the PB2:PBDB&#8208;TF:BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based device with an optimal weight ratio of 0.5:0.5:1 achieved a PCE up to 18.4%. More importantly, PB2 exhibited good compatibility with various non&#8208;fullerene acceptors to achieve better PCEs than those of classical polymer (PBDB&#8208;T and PBDB&#8208;TF)&#8208;based devices. When PB2 was combined with wide bandgap electron acceptor (F&#8208;BTA3), this device showed the excellent PCE of 27.1% and 24.6% for 1 and 10 cm2 devices, respectively, under light intensity of 1000 lux light&#8208;emitting diode illumination. These results provide new insight in the rational design of novel non&#8208;halogenated polymer donors for further developing low&#8208;cost materials and broadening the application of OPV cells.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancy Injection as a Pathway to Enhancing Electromechanical Response in Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Since their discovery in late 1940s, perovskite ferroelectric materials have become one of the central objects of condensed matter physics and materials science due to the broad spectrum of functional behaviors they exhibit, including electro&#8208;optical phenomena and strong electromechanical coupling. In such disordered materials, the static properties of defects such as oxygen vacancies is well explored, but the dynamic effects are less understood. In this work, we report the first observation of enhanced electromechanical response in BaTiO3 thin films driven via dynamic local oxygen vacancy control in piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). We explicitly demonstrate a persistence in peizoelectricity past the bulk Curie temperature, and an enhanced electromechanical response due to a created internal electric field that further enhances the intrinsic electrostriction. Our findings are supported by a series of temperature dependent band excitation PFM in ultra&#8208;high vacuum and a combination of modeling techniques including finite element modeling, Reactive Force Field (ReaxFF), and Density Functional Theory (DFT). This study shows the pivotal role that dynamics of vacancies in complex oxides can play in determining functional properties, and thus provides a new route towards achieving enhanced ferroic response with higher functional temperature windows in ferroelectrics and other ferroic materials.

         <title>Smart Chemical Engineering&#8208;based Lightweight and Miniaturized Attachable Systems for Advanced Drug Delivery and Diagnostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Smart attachable systems have attracted much attention owing to their capabilities in terms of body performance evaluation, disease diagnostics, and drug delivery. Recent advances in chemical and engineering techniques provide many opportunities to improve device fabrication and applications owing to the advantages of being lightweight and easy to control as well as their battery absence and functional diversity. This review highlights the latest developments in the field of chemical engineering&#8208;based lightweight and miniaturized attachable systems, which are mainly inspired by the natural world. Their applications for real&#8208;time monitoring, point&#8208;of&#8208;care sampling, biomarker detection, and controlled release are discussed thoroughly with respect to specific products/prototypes. The perspectives of the field, including persistence guarantee, burden reduction, and personality improvement, are also discussed. It is believed that chemical engineering&#8208;based lightweight and miniaturized attachable systems have good potential in both clinical and industrial fields, indicating a large potential to improve human lives in the near future.

         <title>Surface Chemistry Engineering of Perovskite Quantum Dots: Strategies, Applications, and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The presence of surface ligands not only plays a key role in keeping colloidal integrity and non&#8208;defective surface of metal halide perovskite quantum dots (PQDs), but also serve as a knob to tune their optoelectronic properties for a variety of exciting applications including solar cells and light&#8208;emitting diodes. However, these indispensable surface ligands may also deteriorate the stability and key properties of PQDs due to their highly dynamic binding and insulating nature. To address these issues, a number of innovative surface engineering approaches have been developed in the past few years. Based on an in&#8208;depth fundamental understanding in the surface atomistic structure and surface defect formation in the tiny nanoparticles, this review presents a critical overview focusing on surface chemistry engineering of PQDs including advanced colloidal synthesis, in&#8208;situ surface passivation, and solution&#8208;phase/solid&#8208;state ligand exchange, before highlighting their unprecedented achievements in photovoltaics and other optoelectronics. The practical hurdles and future directions are cirtically discussed to inspire more rational surface design towards efficient and reliable next generation PQD technologies.

         <title>Towards Perfect Optical Diffusers: Dielectric Huygens' Metasurfaces with Critical Positional Disorder</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Conventional optical diffusers, such as thick volume scatterers (Rayleigh scattering) or microstructured surface scatterers (geometric scattering), lack the potential for on&#8208;chip integration and are thus incompatible with next&#8208;generation photonic devices. Dielectric Huygens' metasurfaces, on the other hand, consist of two&#8208;dimensional arrangements of resonant dielectric nanoparticles and therefore constitute a promising material platform for ultra&#8208;thin and highly efficient photonic devices. When the nanoparticles are arranged in a random but statistically specific fashion, diffusers with exceptional properties are expected to come within reach. In this contribution, we&#160;explore how dielectric Huygens' metasurfaces can be used to implement wavelength&#8208;selective diffusers with negligible absorption losses and nearly&#8208;Lambertian scattering profiles that are largely independent of the angle and polarization of incident waves. We&#160;show that the combination of tailored positional disorder with a carefully&#8208;balanced electric and magnetic response of the nanoparticles is an integral requirement for the operation as a diffuser. We&#160;experimentally and numerically characterize the directional scattering performance of the proposed metasurfaces and highlight their usability in wavefront&#8208;shaping applications. Since our&#160;metasurfaces operate on the principles of Mie scattering and are embedded in a glassy environment, they may easily be incorporated in integrated photonic devices, fiber optics, or mechanically robust augmented reality&#160;displays.

         <title>Material Evolution with Nanotechnology, Nanoarchitectonics, and Materials Informatics: What will be the Next Paradigm Shift in Nanoporous Materials?</title>

Abstract
Materials science and chemistry have played a central and significant role in advancing our society. With the shift toward sustainable living, it is anticipated that the development of functional materials will continue to be vital for sustaining life on our planet. In the recent decades, rapid progress has been made in materials science and chemistry owing to the advances in experimental, analytical, and computational methods, thereby producing several novel and useful materials. However, most problems in material development are highly complex. In this review article, we discuss the best strategy for the development of functional materials via the implementation of three key concepts: nanotechnology as a game changer, nanoarchitectonics as an integrator, and materials informatics as a super accelerator. Discussions from conceptual viewpoints and exemplified recent developments, chiefly focused on nanoporous materials, are presented. We anticipate that coupling these three strategies together will open advanced routes for the swift designing and exploratory search of functional materials truly useful for solving real&#8208;world problems. These novel strategies will result in the evolution of nanoporous functional materials.

         <title>An Engineered Pseudo&#8208;Macrophage for Rapid Treatment of Bacteria&#8208;Infected Osteomyelitis via Microwave&#8208;Excited Anti&#8208;Infection and Immunoregulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered pseudo&#8208;macrophage M&#8208;Fe3O4/Au therapeutic nanoparticles (NPs) that can be locally accumulated at infection sites through double targeting of proteins and magnets and that can mitigate the inflammatory response by immunoregulation through an electromagnetic field produced by microwave (MW) irradiation and neutralizing inflammatory cytokine, are developed; the Fe3O4/Au NPs can generate O2&#8722; and heat by MW assistance.








Abstract
Preventing deep bacterial infection and simultaneously enhancing osteogenic differentiation are in great demand for osteomyelitis. Microwave (MW) dynamic therapy is attracting attention due to its excellent penetration ability, but the mechanism of MW&#8208;induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) is still unknown. Herein, MW&#8208;responsive engineered pseudo&#8208;macrophages (M&#8208;Fe3O4/Au nanoparticles (NPs)) are fabricated to clear Staphylococcus aureus infections and induce M2 polarization of macrophages to improve osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) under MW irradiation. Fe3O4/Au NPs can generate &#183;O2&#8722; and heat under MW irradiation in a saline solution, and the mechanism is put forward via finite element modeling and density functional theory calculations. Due to the gap plasmon, electromagnetic hotspots are produced at Fe3O4&#8211;Au interface at 2.45&#160;GHz. Because of these induced electromagnetic hotspots, the sodium species is field&#8208;ionized and subsequently reacts with oxygen to produce &#183;O2&#8722;. Meanwhile, the Fe3O4/Au NPs have a stronger ability than Fe3O4 NPs to fix oxygen, favoring the production of ROS. Additionally, MW&#8208;treated macrophages diminish to secrete inflammatory cytokines, resulting in the decrease of ROS production in MSCs and thus enhancing their osteogenic differentiation. These engineered pseudo&#8208;macrophages will be promising for effectively treating bacterial infections and promoting osteoblast differentiation simultaneously in deep tissues under MW irradiation.

         <title>Smoothing the Sodium&#8208;Metal Anode with a Self&#8208;Regulating Alloy Interface for High&#8208;Energy and Sustainable Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;regulating alloy interface, which contains chemically sodiophilic yet electron&#8208;hindered semiconducting Na3Sb nanoislands and a sodiophobic yet electron&#8208;favored conductive Ni matrix, is reported. Benefiting from the unique self&#8208;regulating mechanism and textile&#8208;structured current collector, full cells paired with high&#8208;capacity cathode deliver a ultrahigh energy density exceeding 200&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1 with ultrahigh energy efficiency of 95.8%.








Abstract
Because of the large abundance of sodium (Na) as a source material and the easy fabrication of Na&#8208;containing compounds, the sodium (Na) battery is a more environmentally friendly and sustainable technology than the lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB). Na&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs) are considered promising to realize a high energy density to overtake the cost effectiveness of LIBs, which is critically important in large&#8208;scale applications such as grid energy storage. However, the cycling stability of the Na&#8208;metal anode faces significant challenges particularly under high cycling capacities, due to the complex failure models caused by the formation of Na dendrites. Here, a universal surface strategy, based on a self&#8208;regulating alloy interface of the current collector, to inhibit the formation of Na dendrites is reported. High&#8208;capacity (10 mAh cm&#8722;2) Na&#8208;metal anodes can achieve stable cycling for over 1000 h with a low overpotential of 35&#160;mV. When paired with a high&#8208;capacity Na3V2(PO4)2F3 cathode (7 mAh cm&#8722;2), the SMB delivers an unprecedented energy density (calculated based on all the cell components) over 200&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 with flooded electrolyte, or over 230&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 with lean electrolyte. The dendrite&#8208;free SMB also shows high cycling stability with a capacity retention per cycle over 99.9% and an ultrahigh energy efficiency of 95.8%.

         <title>Video Speed Switching of Plasmonic Structural Colors with High Contrast and Superior Lifetime</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electronic paper technologies are essential for reducing the energy consumption in future display devices. The first example of video speed switching of structural colors over the whole visible region is shown, while retaining high contrast. This is achieved with polarization&#8208;insensitive metasurfaces and conjugated polymers, not liquid crystals. The lifetime is shown to be over ten million cycles.








Abstract
Reflective displays or &#8220;electronic paper&#8221; technologies provide a solution to the high energy consumption of emissive displays by simply utilizing ambient light. However, it has proven challenging to develop electronic paper with competitive image quality and video speed capabilities. Here, the first technology that provides video speed switching of structural colors with high contrast over the whole visible is shown. Importantly, this is achieved with a&#160;broadband&#8208;absorbing polarization&#8208;insensitive electrochromic polymer instead of liquid crystals, which makes it possible to maintain high reflectivity. It is shown that promoting electrophoretic ion transport (drift motion) improves the switch speed. In combination with new nanostructures that have high surface curvature, this enables video speed switching (20&#160;ms) at high contrast (50% reflectivity change). A detailed analysis of the optical signal during switching shows that the polaron formation starts to obey first order reaction kinetics in the video speed regime. Additionally, the system still operates at ultralow power consumption during video speed switching (&lt;1&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) and has negligible power consumption (&lt;1 &#181;W cm&#8722;2) in bistability mode. Finally, the fast switching increases device lifetime to at least 107 cycles, an order of magnitude more than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art.

     alt="Video Speed Switching of Plasmonic Structural Colors with High Contrast and Superior Lifetime"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronic paper technologies are essential for reducing the energy consumption in future display devices. The first example of video speed switching of structural colors over the whole visible region is shown, while retaining high contrast. This is achieved with polarization-insensitive metasurfaces and conjugated polymers, not liquid crystals. The lifetime is shown to be over ten million cycles.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflective displays or &#8220;electronic paper&#8221; technologies provide a solution to the high energy consumption of emissive displays by simply utilizing ambient light. However, it has proven challenging to develop electronic paper with competitive image quality and video speed capabilities. Here, the first technology that provides video speed switching of structural colors with high contrast over the whole visible is shown. Importantly, this is achieved with a&#160;broadband-absorbing polarization-insensitive electrochromic polymer instead of liquid crystals, which makes it possible to maintain high reflectivity. It is shown that promoting electrophoretic ion transport (drift motion) improves the switch speed. In combination with new nanostructures that have high surface curvature, this enables video speed switching (20&#160;ms) at high contrast (50% reflectivity change). A detailed analysis of the optical signal during switching shows that the polaron formation starts to obey first order reaction kinetics in the video speed regime. Additionally, the system still operates at ultralow power consumption during video speed switching (&amp;lt;1&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and has negligible power consumption (&amp;lt;1 &#181;W cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in bistability mode. Finally, the fast switching increases device lifetime to at least 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; cycles, an order of magnitude more than state-of-the-art.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailor&#8208;Made Polyhydroxyalkanoates by Reconstructing Pseudomonas Entomophila</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performing bacterial platform for customized SCL&#8208;co&#8208;MCL/LCL PHA synthesis is developed via rational fine&#8208;tuning approaches, based on which, a series of P(3HB&#8208;co&#8208;MCL/LCL 3HA) copolymers are generated with 3HA ranging from 9 to 18 carbon atoms. The PHA copolymer family is thus further expanded, generating various novel material properties and broader prospects for value&#8208;added applications.








Abstract
Microbial polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) containing short&#8208; and medium/long&#8208;chain&#8208;length monomers, abbreviated as SCL&#8208;co&#8208;MCL/LCL PHAs, generate suitable thermal and mechanical properties. However, SCL&#8208;co&#8208;MCL/LCL PHAs with carbon chain longer than nine are difficult to synthesize due to the low specificity of PHA synthase PhaC and the lack of either SCL&#8208; or MCL/LCL monomer precursor fluxes. This study succeeds in reprogramming a &#946;&#8208;oxidation weakened Pseudomonas entomophila containing synthesis pathways of SCL 3&#8208;hydroxybutyryl&#8208;CoA (3HB) from glucose and MCL/LCL 3&#8208;hydroxyalkanoyl&#8208;CoA from fatty acids with carbon chain lengths from 9 to 18, respectively, that are polymerized under a low specificity PhaC61&#8208;3 to form P(3HB&#8208;co&#8208;MCL/LCL 3HA) copolymers. Through rational flux&#8208;tuning approaches, the optimized recombinant P. entomophila accumulates 55 wt% poly&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate in 8.4&#160;g L&#8722;1 cell dry weight. Combined with weakened &#946;&#8208;oxidation, a series of novel P(3HB&#8208;co&#8208;MCL/LCL 3HA) copolymers with over 60 wt% PHA in 9&#160;g L&#8722;1 cell dry weight have been synthesized for the first time. P. entomophila has become a high&#8208;performing platform to generate tailor&#8208;made new SCL&#8208;co&#8208;MCL/LCL PHAs.

         <title>Stretchable Thin Film Mechanical&#8208;Strain&#8208;Gated Switches and Logic Gate Functions Based on a Soft Tunneling Barrier</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical&#8208;strain&#8208;gated electric switches play a key role in sensing, soft robotics, and stretchable electronics, which typically operate an &#8220;off&#8208;switch&#8221; function&#8212;exhibiting a decrease in conductivity upon an applied strain. A thin&#8208;film architecture that features the inverse behavior, &#8220;on&#8208;switch&#8221;: a strain&#8208;induced transition from insulating to metallic conductivity, spanning nine orders of magnitude in conductivity, is demonstrated.








Abstract
Mechanical&#8208;strain&#8208;gated switches are cornerstone components of material&#8208;embedded circuits that perform logic operations without using conventional electronics. This technology requires a single material system to exhibit three distinct functionalities: strain&#8208;invariant conductivity and an increase or decrease of conductivity upon mechanical deformation. Herein, mechanical&#8208;strain&#8208;gated electric switches based on a thin&#8208;film architecture that features an insulator&#8208;to&#8208;conductor transition when mechanically stretched are demonstrated. The conductivity changes by nine orders of magnitude over a wide range of tunable working strains (as high as 130%). The approach relies on a nanometer&#8208;scale sandwiched bilayer Au thin film with an ultrathin poly(dimethylsiloxane) elastomeric barrier layer; applied strain alters the electron tunneling currents through the barrier. Mechanical&#8208;force&#8208;controlled electric logic circuits are achieved by realizing strain&#8208;controlled basic (AND and OR) and universal (NAND and NOR) logic gates in a single system. The proposed material system can be used to fabricate material&#8208;embedded logics of arbitrary complexity for a wide range of applications including soft robotics, wearable/implantable electronics, human&#8211;machine interfaces, and Internet of Things.

         <title>Quantum Oscillations in Ferromagnetic (Sb, V)2Te3 Topological Insulator Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic study of electric transport in Sb2&#8722;xVxTe3 films demonstrates the coexistence of topological surface states and long&#8208;range ferromagnetism evidenced by Shubnikov&#8211;de Haas oscillations. Vanadium doping acts as an efficient tuning parameter for the Fermi surface size. This opens up a new route for the investigation of the crossover between different topological states based on this material class.








Abstract
An effective way of manipulating 2D surface states in magnetic topological insulators may open a new route for quantum technologies based on the quantum anomalous Hall effect. The doping&#8208;dependent evolution of the electronic band structure in the topological insulator Sb2&#8722;xVxTe3 (0&#160;&#8804;&#160;x&#160;&#8804;&#160;0.102) thin films is studied by means of electrical transport. Sb2&#8722;xVxTe3 thin films were&#160;prepared by molecular beam epitaxy, and Shubnikov&#8211;de Hass (SdH) oscillations are observed in both the longitudinal and transverse transport channels. Doping with the 3d element, vanadium, induces long&#8208;range ferromagnetic order with enhanced SdH oscillation amplitudes. The doping effect is systematically studied in various films depending on thickness and bottom gate voltage. The angle&#8208;dependence of the SdH oscillations reveals their 2D nature, linking them to topological surface states as their origin. Furthermore, it is shown that vanadium doping can efficiently modify the band structure. The tunability by doping and the coexistence of the surface states with ferromagnetism render Sb2&#8722;xVxTe3 thin films a promising platform for energy band engineering. In this way, topological quantum states may be manipulated to crossover from quantum Hall effect to quantum anomalous Hall effect, which opens an alternative route for the design of quantum electronics and spintronics.

         <title>Selective Thrombosis of Tumor for Enhanced Hypoxia&#8208;Activated Prodrug Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional nanoplatform is developed by encapsulating coagulation&#8208;inducing protease thrombin and a hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrug tirapazamine into metal&#8211;organic framework nanoparticles with a tumor&#8208;homing ligand, which can selectively activate platelet aggregation at a tumor to induce thrombosis and vascular obstruction therapy. Meanwhile, the thrombus can cut off the blood oxygen supply and potentiate the hypoxia level to enhance the prodrug therapy.








Abstract
One of the main challenges for tumor vascular infarction in combating cancer lies in failing to produce sustained complete thrombosis. Inspired by the capability of vascular infarction in blocking the delivery of oxygen to aggravate tumor hypoxia, the performance of selective tumor thrombus inducing hypoxia activation therapy to improve the therapeutic index of coagulation&#8208;based tumor therapy is presented. By encapsulating coagulation&#8208;inducing protease thrombin and a hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrug (HAP) tirapazamine into metal&#8211;organic framework nanoparticles with a tumor&#8208;homing ligand, the obtained nanoplatform selectively activates platelet aggregation at the tumor to induce thrombosis and vascular obstruction therapy by the exposed thrombin. Meanwhile, the thrombus can cut off the blood oxygen supply and potentiate the hypoxia levels to enhance the HAP therapy. This strategy not only addresses the dissatisfaction of vascular therapy, but also conquers the dilemma of inadequate hypoxia in HAP treatment. Since clinical operations such as surgery can be used to induce coagulation, coagulation&#8208;based synergistic therapy is promising for translation into a clinical combination regimen.

     alt="Selective Thrombosis of Tumor for Enhanced Hypoxia-Activated Prodrug Therapy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A multifunctional nanoplatform is developed by encapsulating coagulation-inducing protease thrombin and a hypoxia-activated prodrug tirapazamine into metal&#8211;organic framework nanoparticles with a tumor-homing ligand, which can selectively activate platelet aggregation at a tumor to induce thrombosis and vascular obstruction therapy. Meanwhile, the thrombus can cut off the blood oxygen supply and potentiate the hypoxia level to enhance the prodrug therapy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main challenges for tumor vascular infarction in combating cancer lies in failing to produce sustained complete thrombosis. Inspired by the capability of vascular infarction in blocking the delivery of oxygen to aggravate tumor hypoxia, the performance of selective tumor thrombus inducing hypoxia activation therapy to improve the therapeutic index of coagulation-based tumor therapy is presented. By encapsulating coagulation-inducing protease thrombin and a hypoxia-activated prodrug (HAP) tirapazamine into metal&#8211;organic framework nanoparticles with a tumor-homing ligand, the obtained nanoplatform selectively activates platelet aggregation at the tumor to induce thrombosis and vascular obstruction therapy by the exposed thrombin. Meanwhile, the thrombus can cut off the blood oxygen supply and potentiate the hypoxia levels to enhance the HAP therapy. This strategy not only addresses the dissatisfaction of vascular therapy, but also conquers the dilemma of inadequate hypoxia in HAP treatment. Since clinical operations such as surgery can be used to induce coagulation, coagulation-based synergistic therapy is promising for translation into a clinical combination regimen.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Atomically Dispersed Ni&#8211;Zn Pair Sites for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic effect induced by electronic interactions is observed on novel atomically dispersed Ni&#8211;Zn pair sites with superior activity and outstanding selectivity for CO2 electroreduction; better yet, the origin of this synergistic effect is revealed, both in the thermodynamic pathway and kinetic pathway.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts have the potential to outperform the well&#8208;established single&#8208;atom catalysts for the electrochemical conversion of CO2. However, the lack of understanding regarding the mechanism of this enhanced catalytic process prevents the rational design of high&#8208;performance catalysts. Herein, an obvious synergistic effect in atomically dispersed Ni&#8211;Zn bimetal sites is observed. In situ characterization combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveals that heteronuclear coordination modifies the d&#8208;states of the metal atom, narrowing the gap between the d&#8208;band centre (&#949;d) of the Ni (3d) orbitals and the Fermi energy level (EF) to strengthen the electronic interaction at the reaction interface, resulting in a lower free energy barrier (&#916;G) in the thermodynamic pathway and a reduced activation energy (Ea) as well as fortified metal&#8211;C bonding in the kinetic pathway. Consequently, a CO faradaic efficiency of &gt;90% is obtained across a broad potential window from &#8722;0.5 to &#8722;1.0&#160;V (vs RHE), reaching a maximum of 99% at &#8722;0.8&#160;V, superior to that of the Ni/Zn single&#8208;metal sites.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Monolayer YOx/MoOx on Ultrathin Pt Nanowires Boosts Alcohol Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of sub&#8208;monolayer YOx/MoOx&#8208;surface&#8208;co&#8208;decorated ultrathin platinum (Pt) nanowires is demonstrated to effectively boost alcohol oxidation electrocatalysis. The surface Y and Mo atoms make the free energies of CO* and COOH* be decoupled on the nanowire surfaces, lowering the energy barriers for the oxidation of CO* into COOH*.








Abstract
A crucial issue restricting the application of direct alcohol fuel cells (DAFCs) is the low activity of Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts for alcohol oxidation reaction caused by the reaction intermediate (CO*) poisoning. Herein, a new strategy is demonstrated for making a class of sub&#8208;monolayer YOx/MoOx&#8208;surface co&#8208;decorated ultrathin platinum nanowires (YOx/MoOx&#8211;Pt NWs) to effectively eliminate the CO poisoning for enhancing methanol oxidation electrocatalysis. By adjusting the amounts of YOx and MoOx decorated on the surface of ultrathin Pt NWs, the optimized 22% YOx/MoOx&#8211;Pt NWs achieve a high specific activity of 3.35&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a mass activity of 2.10 A mgPt&#8722;1, as well as the enhanced stability. In situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and CO stripping studies confirm the contribution of YOx and MoOx to anti&#8208;CO poisoning ability of the NWs. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that the surface Y and Mo atoms with oxidation states allow COOH* to bind the surface through both the carbon and oxygen atoms, which can lower the free energy barriers for the oxidation of CO* into COOH*. The optimal NWs also show the superior activities toward the electro&#8208;oxidation of ethanol, ethylene glycol, and glycerol.

         <title>Ambulatory Cardiovascular Monitoring Via a Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Assisted Textile Triboelectric Sensor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A waterproof textile&#8208;based wearable cardiovascular monitoring system is developed via systematic integration of a triboelectric sensor, a signal processing circuit, a Bluetooth module, and a customized user&#8208;friendly app interface. With the assistance of machine&#8208;learning algorithms, this system can perform continuous blood pressure monitoring against body motion and perspiration.








Abstract
Wearable bioelectronics for continuous and reliable pulse wave monitoring against body motion and perspiration remains a great challenge and highly desired. Here, a low&#8208;cost, lightweight, and mechanically durable textile triboelectric sensor that can convert subtle skin deformation caused by arterial pulsatility into electricity for high&#8208;fidelity and continuous pulse waveform monitoring in an ambulatory and sweaty setting is developed. The sensor holds a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio of 23.3 dB, a response time of 40 ms, and a sensitivity of 0.21 &#181;A kPa&#8722;1. With the assistance of machine learning algorithms, the textile triboelectric sensor can continuously and precisely measure systolic and diastolic pressure, and the accuracy is validated via a commercial blood pressure cuff at the hospital. Additionally, a customized cellphone application (APP) based on built&#8208;in algorithm is developed for one&#8208;click health data sharing and data&#8208;driven cardiovascular diagnosis. The textile triboelectric sensor enabled wireless biomonitoring system is expected to offer a practical paradigm for continuous and personalized cardiovascular system characterization in the era of the Internet of Things.

         <title>Pangolin&#8208;Inspired Stretchable, Microwave&#8208;Invisible Metascale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pangolin&#8208;inspired metascale is developed to simultaneously realize stretchable and microwave&#8208;invisible functions. The elastomeric matrix endows the metascale with high stretchability, and therefore nondevelopable surface conformality. The overlapping arrangement of electromagnetic dissipative scales ensures the metascale has robust microwave&#8208;absorbing capacity under the interference of mechanical deformation and also plays significant role in resisting out&#8208;of&#8208;plane puncture damage.








Abstract
Microwave&#8208;invisible devices are emerging as a valuable technology in various applications, including soft robotics, shape&#8208;morphing structures, and textural camouflages, especially in electronic countermeasures. Unfortunately, conventional microwave&#8208;absorbing metastructures and bulk absorbers are stretching confined, limiting their application in deformable or special&#8208;shaped targets. To overcome such limitations, a conceptually novel soft&#8211;rigid&#8208;connection strategy, inspired by the pangolin, is proposed. Pangolin&#8208;inspired metascale (PIMS), which is a kind of stretchable metamaterial consisting of an electromagnetic dissipative scale (EMD&#8208;scale) and elastomer, is rationally designed. Such a device exhibits robust microwave&#8208;absorbing capacity under the interference of 50% stretching. Besides, profiting from the covering effect and size&#8208;confined effect of EMD&#8208;scale, the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane indentation failure force of PIMS is at least 5 times larger than conventional device. As a proof of concept, the proposed device is conformally pasted on nondevelopable surfaces. For a spherical dome surface, the maximum radar cross&#8208;section (RCS) reduction of PIMS is 6.3&#160;dB larger than that of a conventional device, while for a saddle surface, the bandwidth of 10&#160;dB RCS reduction exhibits an increase of 83%. In short, this work provides a conceptually novel platform to develop stretchable, nondevelopable surface conformable functional devices.

Besides, profiting from the covering effect and size-confined effect of EMD-scale, the out-of-plane indentation failure force of PIMS is at least 5 times larger than conventional device. As a proof of concept, the proposed device is conformally pasted on nondevelopable surfaces. For a spherical dome surface, the maximum radar cross-section (RCS) reduction of PIMS is 6.3&#160;dB larger than that of a conventional device, while for a saddle surface, the bandwidth of 10&#160;dB RCS reduction exhibits an increase of 83%. In short, this work provides a conceptually novel platform to develop stretchable, nondevelopable surface conformable functional devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Pyrite Iron Disulfide Cathode with a Copper Current Collector for High&#8208;Energy Reversible Magnesium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effective Mg&#8208;ion storage of an apyrite FeS2 cathode is realized by introducing a redox couple of cuprous sulfide and copper, originating from the copper current collector. An impressive energy density of 714&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 dominated by a four&#8208;electron conversion reaction (Fe2+/Fe and S22&#8722;/S2&#8722;) and good cycling stability over 1000 cycles of the as&#8208;prepared FeS2 nanomaterial cathode are achieved.








Abstract
Owing to its low cost, high theoretical capacity, and environmentally friendly characteristics, pyrite FeS2 demonstrates promise as a cathode material for high&#8208;energy metal&#8208;anode&#8208;based rechargeable batteries. When it is used in a rechargeable magnesium battery (RMB), the electrode couple exhibits an extremely low theoretical volume change upon full discharge. However, its electrochemical Mg&#8208;ion storage is considerably hindered by slow reaction kinetics. In this study, a high&#8208;performance FeS2 cathode for RMBs using a copper current collector is reported, which is involved in cathode reactions via a reversible redox process between copper and cuprous sulfide. This phase transformation with the formation of copper nanowires during discharge activates the redox reactions of FeS2 via a two&#8208;step and four&#8208;electron Mg&#8208;ion transfer that dominates the cathode reactions. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared FeS2 nanomaterial cathode delivers a significantly enhanced reversible capacity of 679 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1. The corresponding energy density of 714&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 is superior to those of all previously reported metal chalcogenide cathodes in RMBs or hybrid batteries using a Mg metal anode. Notably, the as&#8208;assembled FeS2&#8211;Mg battery can operate over 1000 cycles with a good capacity retention at 400&#160;mA g&#8722;1.

         <title>Designing New&#8208;Generation Piezoelectric Transducers by Embedding Superior Graphene&#8208;Based Thermal Regulators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient multidirectional heat&#8208;escape channels are constructed via synthesizing a brand&#8208;new chemical&#8208;vapor&#8208;deposition&#8208;derived 3D/2D graphene homojunction on an AlN&#8208;thermosensitive&#8208;ceramic template. New&#8208;generation cascaded&#8208;piezoelectric&#8208;transducers are designed and constructed via embedding the 3D/2D&#8208;graphene/AlN&#8208;ceramic&#8208;based thermal regulators, which can simultaneously uniformize, transmit, and release heat. The self&#8208;heating&#8208;caused temperature rise is substantially reduced by &#8776;60%, along with dramatically enhanced electroacoustic&#8208;energy&#8208;conversion efficiency and amplitude.








Abstract
Cascaded&#8208;piezoelectric&#8208;transducers (CPETs) is a key component in modern energy&#8208;conversion fields, possessing versatile applications in ultrasonic scalpels, acoustic levitation, and sonar. However, serious self&#8208;heating inevitably occurs inside high&#8208;power CPETs, severely limiting their practical applications in broader fields. To tackle this, multidirectional heat&#8208;escape channels of multidimensional (multi&#8208;D, 3D/2D) graphene films are introduced in designing new&#8208;type thermal regulators. A porous AlN&#8208;ceramic thermal&#8208;sink is creatively selected as a template for directly synthesizing graphene via a two&#8208;step chemical vapor deposition strategy. This perfect combination of 3D/2D&#8208;graphene and the AlN ceramic can integrate their complementary advantages in uniformizing, transmitting, and releasing heat. Amazingly, in the new&#8208;generation CPETs embedded with these graphene&#8208;based thermal regulators, the self&#8208;heating&#8208;induced temperature rise can be substantially reduced by &#8776;60% (far exceeding actual demand standard). As another kernel parameter, electroacoustic&#8208;energy&#8208;conversion efficiency is dramatically improved in the new&#8208;generation CPETs. Briefly, this research realizes the first synthesis of a novel multi&#8208;D&#8208;graphene/AlN&#8208;ceramic hybrid, and propels its brand&#8208;new application directions in new&#8208;generation energy&#8208;conversion&#8208; and thermal&#8208;management&#8208;related territories.

         <title>An Injectable Meta&#8208;Biomaterial: From Design and Simulation to In Vivo Shaping and Tissue Induction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metamaterials gain unusual properties through their microstructure rather than specific chemistry. An elastic, porous, and injectable (EPI) microscaffold metamaterial is simulated and designed. The EPI provides experimental proof to the conjecture of elastic strain softening in microgel suspensions. Initially shapeable, it dynamically matches the local tissue mechanics, and templates long&#8208;term soft tissue colonization and vascularization.








Abstract
A novel type of injectable biomaterial with an elastic softening transition is described. The material enables in&#160;vivo shaping, followed by induction of 3D stable vascularized tissue. The synthesis of the injectable meta&#8208;biomaterial is instructed by extensive numerical simulation as a suspension of irregularly fragmented, highly porous sponge&#8208;like microgels. The irregular particle shape dramatically enhances yield strain for in&#160;vivo stability against deformation. Porosity of the particles, along with friction between internal surfaces, provides the elastic softening transition. This emergent metamaterial property enables the material to reversibly change stiffness during deformation, allowing native tissue properties to be matched over a wide range of deformation amplitudes. After subcutaneous injection in mice, predetermined shapes can be sculpted manually. The 3D shape is maintained during excellent host tissue integration, with induction of vascular connective tissue that persists to the end of one&#8208;year follow&#8208;up. The geometrical design is compatible with many hydrogel materials, including cell&#8208;adhesion motives for cell transplantation. The injectable meta&#8208;biomaterial therefore provides new perspectives in soft tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

         <title>Hybrid Dielectric Films of Inkjet&#8208;Printable Core&#8211;Shell Nanoparticles</title>

A new type of core&#8211;shell nanoparticle dielectric that is suitable for inkjet printing is presented. Gold cores are covalently grafted with polystyrene. The resulting inks are used to spin&#8208;coat and inkjet&#8208;print dielectric films. The covalently attached shell prevents percolation and ensures high dielectric constants without the risk of dielectric breakdown.








A new type of hybrid core&#8211;shell nanoparticle dielectric that is suitable for inkjet printing is introduced. Gold cores (dcore&#160;&#8776; 4.5 nm diameter) are covalently grafted with thiol&#8208;terminated polystyrene (Mn&#160;= 11000 Da and Mn&#160;= 5000 Da) and used as inks to spin&#8208;coat and inkjet&#8208;print dielectric films. The dielectric layers have&#160;metal volume fractions of 5 to 21 vol% with either random or face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic structures depending on the polymer length and grafting density. Films with 21 vol% metal have&#160;dielectric constants of 50@1 Hz. Structural and electrical characterization using transmission electron microscopy, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, and impedance spectroscopy indicates that classical random capacitor&#8211;resistor network models partially describe this hybrid material but fail at high metal fractions, where the covalently attached shell prevents percolation and ensures high dielectric constants without the risk of dielectric breakdown. A comparison of disordered to ordered films indicates that the network structure affects dielectric properties less than the metal content. The applicability of the new dielectric material is demonstrated by formulating inkjet inks and printing devices. An inkjet&#8208;printed capacitor with an area of 0.79 mm2 and a 17 nm thick dielectric had&#160;a capacitance of 2.2&#177;0.1&#8201;nF@1&#8201;kHz.

A comparison of disordered to ordered films indicates that the network structure affects dielectric properties less than the metal content. The applicability of the new dielectric material is demonstrated by formulating inkjet inks and printing devices. An inkjet-printed capacitor with an area of 0.79 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a 17 nm thick dielectric had&#160;a capacitance of 2.2&#177;0.1&#8201;nF@1&#8201;kHz.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dilute Aqueous&#8208;Aprotic Hybrid Electrolyte Enabling a Wide Electrochemical Window through Solvation Structure Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dilute aqueous&#8208;aprotic hybrid electrolyte is developed with broad electrochemical window. The introduced aprotic solvent can regulate the solvation structures of the electrolyte and the water molecules are strongly confined around the Na cations. As a result, in such a hybrid electrolyte, the decomposition of water is suppressed and the electrochemical window of the water is broadened.








Abstract
The application of superconcentrated aqueous electrolytes has shown great potential in developing high&#8208;voltage electrochemical double&#8208;layer capacitors (EDLCs). However, the broadening of the electrochemical window of such superconcentrated electrolytes is at the expense of their high cost, low ionic conductivity, high density, and narrow operating temperature range. Herein, the electrochemical window of water (&gt;3&#160;V) at low salt concentration (3 m) is expanded by using an aprotic solvent, i.e., trimethyl phosphate (TMP), to regulate the solvation structure of the electrolyte. Benefiting from the low salt concentration, such electrolyte is simultaneously featured with high ionic conductivity, low density, and wide temperature compatibility. Based on the dilute hybrid electrolyte, EDLCs constructed by using porous graphene electrodes are able to operate within an enlarged voltage range of 0&#8211;2.4&#160;V at a wide range of temperatures from &#8722;20 to 60&#160;&#176;C. They also present excellent rate capability and cycle stability, i.e., 83% capacitance retention after 100&#160;000 cycles. Density functional theory calculations verify that TMP induces a significant electronic modulation for the bonding environment of the electrolyte. This enables the stronger binding of Na+&#8211;H2O with freely migrating TMP to expand the voltage window to exceed the potential limitation of aqueous electrolytes.

         <title>Electrode&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Healed Monolayer MoS2 for High Performance Transistors and Phototransistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel sulfide electrode system allows sulfur&#8208;vacancy self&#8208;healing in 2D MoS2. Ultrathin CuS electrode heals defects in the MoS2 channel spontaneously upon mild thermal annealing. The self&#8208;healed CuS/MoS2 transistors and phototransistors show impressive device performance.








Abstract
Contact engineering for monolayered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) is considered to be of fundamental challenge for realizing high&#8208;performance TMDCs&#8208;based (opto) electronic devices. Here, an innovative concept is established for a device configuration with metallic copper monosulfide (CuS) electrodes that induces sulfur vacancy healing in the monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) channel. Excess sulfur adatoms from the metallic CuS electrodes are donated to heal sulfur vacancy defects in MoS2 that surprisingly improve the overall performance of its devices. The electrode&#8208;induced self&#8208;healing mechanism is demonstrated and analyzed systematically using various spectroscopic analyses, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and electrical measurements. Without any passivation layers, the self&#8208;healed MoS2 (photo)transistor with the CuS contact electrodes show outstanding room temperature field effect mobility of 97.6 cm2 (Vs)&#8722;1, On/Off ratio &gt; 108,&#160;low subthreshold swing of 120&#160;mV per decade, high photoresponsivity of 1 &#215; 104&#160;A W&#8722;1, and detectivity of 1013 jones, which are the best among back&#8208;gated transistors that employ 1L MoS2. Using ultrathin and flexible 2D CuS and MoS2, mechanically flexible photosensor is also demonstrated, which shows excellent durability under mechanical strain. These findings demonstrate a promising strategy in TMDCs or other 2D material for the development of high performance and functional devices including self&#8208;healable sulfide electrodes.

         <title>Fully Bottom&#8208;Up Waste&#8208;Free Growth of Ultrathin Silicon Wafer via Self&#8208;Releasing Seed Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully bottom&#8208;up technique for fabricating a self&#8208;releasing ultrathin silicon wafer without sacrificing any of the substrate is presented, whereas conventional technologies waste large amounts of such material. A plasma&#8208;assisted epitaxially grown silicon seed layer with a self&#8208;organized nanogap is a key for the realization of the fully bottom&#8208;up process. The results represent a technological breakthrough in advanced silicon microelectronics and photovoltaics.








Abstract
The fabrication of ultrathin silicon wafers at low cost is crucial for advancing silicon electronics toward stretchability and flexibility. However, conventional fabrication techniques are inefficient because they sacrifice a large amount of substrate material. Thus, advanced silicon electronics that have been realized in laboratories cannot move forward to commercialization. Here, a fully bottom&#8208;up technique for producing a self&#8208;releasing ultrathin silicon wafer without sacrificing any of the substrate is presented. The key to this approach is a self&#8208;organized nanogap on the substrate fabricated by plasma&#8208;assisted epitaxial growth (plasma&#8208;epi) and subsequent hydrogen annealing. The wafer thickness can be independently controlled during the bulk growth after the formation of plasma&#8208;epi seed layer. In addition, semiconductor devices are realized using the ultrathin silicon wafer. Given the high scalability of plasma&#8208;epi and its compatibility with conventional semiconductor process, the proposed bottom&#8208;up wafer fabrication process will open a new route to developing advanced silicon electronics.

         <title>Pathologically Responsive Mitochondrial Gene Therapy in an Allotopic Expression&#8208;Independent Manner Cures Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pathologically responsive mitochondrial gene therapy referred to as &#8220;TISUH&#8221; in an allotopic expression&#8208;independent manner achieves accurately in situ mitochondrial gene delivery. It is a novel nanomedicine harnessing pathological characteristics to import exogenous gene into mitochondria for Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy treatment, a capability that has potential to model mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutated disorders and correct genetic abnormalities in other mtDNA mutated diseases.








Abstract
Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a rare inherited blindness caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The disorder is untreatable and tricky, as the existing chemotherapeutic agent Idebenone alleviates symptoms rather than overcoming the underlying cause. Although some studies have made progress on allotopic expression for LHON, in situ mitochondrial gene therapy remains challenging, which may simplify delivery procedures to be a promising therapeutic for LHON. LHON becomes more difficult to manage in the changed mitochondrial microenvironment, including increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Herein, a pathologically responsive mitochondrial gene delivery vector named [triphenylphosphine&#8208;terminated poly(sulfur&#8208;containing thioketal undecafluorohexylamine histamine) and Ide&#8208;terminated poly(sulfur&#8208;containing thioketal undecafluorohexylamine histamine)] (TISUH) is reported to facilitate commendable in situ mitochondrial gene therapy for LHON. TISUH directly targets diseased mitochondria via triphenylphosphine and fluorination addressing the decreasing MMP. In addition, TISUH can be disassembled by high mitochondrial ROS levels to release functional genes for enhancing gene transfection efficiency and fundamentally correcting genetic abnormalities. In both traditional and gene&#8208;mutation&#8208;induced LHON mouse models, TISUH&#8208;mediated gene therapy shows satisfactory curative effect through the sustained therapeutic protein expression in vivo. This work proposes a novel pathologically responsive in situ mitochondrial delivery platform and provides a promising approach for refractory LHON as well as other mtDNA mutated diseases treatments.

         <title>Triple&#8208;Jump Photodynamic Theranostics: MnO2 Combined Upconversion Nanoplatforms Involving a Type&#8208;I Photosensitizer with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Characteristics for Potent Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triple&#8208;jump photodynamic theranostics protocol is explored for high&#8208;efficacy cancer treatment, by establishing an intelligent glutathione&#8208;depleting and NIR&#8208;regulated theranostic nanoplatform comprising a MnO2 nanoshell, upconversion nanoparticles, and aggregation&#8208;induced emission&#8208;active Type&#8208;I photosensitizers.








Abstract
The development of multifunctional nanoplatforms has been recognized as a promising strategy for potent photodynamic theranostics. Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizers undergoing Type&#8208;I reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation pathway appear as potential candidates due to their capability of hypoxia&#8208;tolerance, efficient ROS production, and fluorescence imaging navigation. To further improve their performance, a facile and universal method of constructing a type of glutathione (GSH)&#8208;depleting and near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;regulated nanoplatform for dual&#8208;modal imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) is presented. The nanoplatforms are obtained through the coprecipitation process involving upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and AIE&#8208;active photosensitizers, followed by in situ generation of MnO2 as the outer shell. The introduction of UCNPs actualizes the NIR&#8208;activation of AIE&#8208;active photosensitizers to produce &#183;OH as a Type&#8208;I ROS. Intracellular upregulated GSH&#8208;responsive decomposition of the MnO2 shell to Mn2+ realizes GSH&#8208;depletion, which is a distinctive approach for elevating intracellular &#183;OH. Meanwhile, the generated Mn2+ can implement T1&#8208;weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in specific tumor sites, and mediate the conversion of intracellular H2O2 to &#183;OH. These outputs reveal a triple&#8208;jump &#183;OH production, and this approach brings about distinguished performance in FLI&#8208;MRI&#8208;guided PDT with high&#8208;efficacy, which presents great potential for future clinical translations.

         <title>Variability and Yield in h&#8208;BN&#8208;Based Memristive Circuits: The Role of Each Type of Defect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large (up to 10 kbit) crossbar arrays of nano&#8208;memristors (down to 320&#160;nm &#215; 420&#160;nm) using hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) are fabricated, and their yield and variability are studied. The atomic defects in h&#8208;BN lead to deviations of the electrical characteristics of the devices, while wrinkles, polymer residues, thicker islands, and gaps with the substrate have no remarkable effect.








Abstract
In the race of fabricating solid&#8208;state nano/microelectronic devices using 2D layered materials (LMs), achieving high yield and low device&#8208;to&#8208;device variability are the two main challenges. Electronic devices that drive currents in&#8208;plane and homogeneously along the 2D&#8208;LMs (i.e., transistors, memtransistors) are strongly affected by local defects (i.e., grain boundaries, wrinkles, thickness fluctuations, polymer residues), as they create inhomogeneities and increase the device&#8208;to&#8208;device variability, resulting in a poor performance at the circuit level. Here, it is shown that memristors are insensitive to most types of defects in 2D&#8208;LMs, even when fabricated in academic laboratories that do not meet industrial standards. The reason is that the currents produced in these devices, which flow out&#8208;of&#8208;plane across the 2D&#8208;LM, are always driven locally by the most conductive locations. Consequently, it is concluded that it is much easier to fabricate 2D&#8208;LMs&#8208;based solid&#8208;state nano/microelectronic circuits using memristors than using transistors or memtransistors, not only due to the inherent simpler fabrication process (i.e., less lithography steps) but also because the local defects do not degrade the yield and variability of memristors considerably.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Picosecond Non&#8208;Equilibrium States in the Amorphous Phase of GeTe Phase&#8208;Change Material Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sub&#8208;picosecond response of amorphous GeTe thin film to femtosecond laser excitation is investigated using frequency&#8208;domain interferometry and ab initio molecular dynamics. The results shed a new light on the optically highly excited states in chalcogenide materials involved in both important processes: phase&#8208;change materials in memory devices and ovonic threshold switching phenomenon induced by a static field.








Abstract
The sub&#8208;picosecond response of amorphous germanium telluride thin film to a femtosecond laser excitation is investigated using frequency&#8208;domain interferometry and ab initio molecular dynamics. The time&#8208;resolved measurement of the surface dynamics reveals a shrinkage of the film with a dielectric properties&#8217; response faster than 300 fs. The systematic ab initio molecular dynamics simulations in non&#8208;equilibrium conditions allow the atomic configurations to be retrieved for ionic temperature from 300 to 1100 K and width of the electron distribution from 0.001 to 1.0 eV. Local order of the structures is characterized by in&#8208;depth analysis of the angle distribution, phonon modes, and pair distribution function, which evidence a transition toward a new amorphous electronic excited state close in bonding/structure to the liquid state. The results shed a new light on the optically highly excited states in chalcogenide materials involved in both important processes: phase&#8208;change materials in memory devices and ovonic threshold switching phenomenon induced by a static&#160;field.

         <title>High Antibacterial Activity and Selectivity of the Versatile Polysulfoniums that Combat Drug Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel type of polypeptoid sulfoniums prepared by ring&#8208;opening polymerization and post&#8208;polymerization functionalization exhibit high selectivity and potent in vitro and in vivo antibacterial efficacy with negligible antibacterial resistance. The polymers also show great efficiency in inhibiting Staphylococcus aureus biofilm formations, as well as in further eradicating the mature biofilms.








Abstract
Sulfonium&#8208;ion&#8208;containing polymers exhibit significant potential benefits for various applications. An efficient strategy to synthesize a type of antibacterial sulfonium&#8208;ion&#8208;bearing polypeptoids via a combination of ring&#8208;opening polymerization and a post&#8208;polymerization functionalization with various functional epoxides is presented. A systematic investigation is further performed in order to explore the influence of the overall hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance on the antimicrobial activity and selectivity of the prepared polysulfoniums. Notably, those chlorepoxypropane&#8208;modified polysulfoniums with an optimized amphiphilic balance show higher selectivity toward both Gram&#8208;negative Escherichia coli and Gram&#8208;positive Staphylococcus aureus, than to red blood cells. The polymers also show great efficiency in inhibiting S. aureus biofilm formations, as well as in further eradicating the mature biofilms. Remarkably, negligible antibacterial resistance and cross&#8208;resistance to commercial antibiotics is shown in these polymers. The polysulfoniums further show their potent in vivo antimicrobial efficacy in a multidrug&#8208;resistant S. aureus infection model that is developed on mouse skin. Similar to the antimicrobial peptides, the polysulfoniums are demonstrated to kill bacteria through membrane disruption. The obtained polypeptoid sulfoniums, with high selectivity and potent antibacterial property, are excellent candidates for antibacterial treatment and open up new possibilities for the preparation of a class of innovative antimicrobials.

The design and fabrication of stretchable and highly permeable nanofibrous sensors made from polyaniline is reported. The device produces an intimate connection with solid or living objects and has a very precise performance in discriminating between bending and twisting stimuli at different angles and speeds, as well as in the detection of complex human&#8208;body motions.








Abstract
Wearable strain sensors have been attracting special attention in the detection of human posture and activity, as well as for the assessment of physical rehabilitation and kinematics. However, it is a challenge to fabricate stretchable and comfortable&#8208;to&#8208;wear permeable strain sensors that can provide highly accurate and continuous motion recording while exerting minimal constraints and maintaining low interference with the body. Herein, covalently grafting nanofibrous polyaniline (PANI) onto stretchable elastomer nanomeshes is reported to obtain a freestanding ultrathin (varying from 300 to 10 000&#160;nm) strain sensor that has high gas permeability (10&#8211;33&#160;mg h&#8211;1). The sensor demonstrates a low weight and can be directly laminated onto the dynamic human skin for long periods of time. The sensor, which produces an intimate connection with solid or living objects, has a stable performance with excellent sustainability, linearity, durability, and low hysteresis. It exibits excellent performance for continuous interrogation of complex movements, mimicking muscle activities, and resembling brain activity. This includes a very precise discrimination of bending and twisting stimuli at different angles (1&#8211;180&#176;) and speeds (3&#8211;18&#160;rpm) and very low exertion of counter&#8208;interference. These results imply the utility of this appraoch for advanced developments of robotic e&#8208;skins or e&#8208;muscles.

         <title>Design of Aligned Porous Carbon Films with Single&#8208;Atom Co&#8211;N&#8211;C Sites for High&#8208;Current&#8208;Density Hydrogen Generation</title>

         <dc:description>
A film electrode consisting of atomic Co&#8211;N&#8211;C sites dispersed on vertically aligned porous nanocarbon is designed, with merits of high intrinsic activity, enriched number of active sites, and efficient mass transport of both the liquid reactant and the gaseous product, enabling it to be used for high&#8208;current&#8208;density hydrogen generation with high activity and stability.








Abstract
Metal&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (M&#8211;N&#8211;C) materials as a unique class of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have increasingly attracted attention as the replacement of platinum for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER); however, their employment as HER electrodes at high current densities of industrial level remains a grand challenge. Herein, an aligned porous carbon film embedded with single&#8208;atom Co&#8211;N&#8211;C sites of exceptional activity and stability at high current densities is designed. Within the film, the atomic CoNx moieties exhibit high intrinsic activity, while the multiscale porosity of the carbon frameworks with vertically aligned microchannels afford facilitated mass transfer under the conditions of high production rate and ultrathick electrodes. Moreover, the superwetting properties of the film promote electrolyte wetting and ensure the timely removal of the evolving H2 gas bubbles. The as&#8208;designed film can work as an efficient HER electrode to deliver 500 and 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in acid at overpotentials of 272 and 343&#160;mV, respectively, and can operate uninterruptedly and stably at 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for at least 32 h under static conditions. These findings pave the road toward the rational design of SACs with improved activity and stability at high current densities in gas&#8208;evolving electrocatalytic processes.

         <title>Carbon Nanotube&#8211;Hydrogel Composites Facilitate Neuronal Differentiation While Maintaining Homeostasis of Network Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new, versatile method for the preparation of carbon nanotube&#8211;poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogel composites is developed. The effects of the composites on neuronal differentiation and activity of pheochromocytoma 12 (PC12) cells, adult neural stem cells, and primary hippocampal neurons are investigated. It is demonstrated that the composites can serve as effective scaffolds promoting neuronal differentiation while maintaining network activity homeostasis.








Abstract
It is often assumed that carbon nanotubes (CNTs) stimulate neuronal differentiation by transferring electrical signals and enhancing neuronal excitability. Given this, CNT&#8211;hydrogel composites are regarded as potential materials able to combine high electrical conductivity with biocompatibility, and therefore promote nerve regeneration. However, whether CNT&#8211;hydrogel composites actually influence neuronal differentiation and maturation, and how they do so remain elusive. In this study, CNT&#8211;hydrogel composites are prepared by in situ polymerization of poly(ethylene glycol) around a preformed CNT meshwork. It is demonstrated that the composites facilitate long&#8208;term survival and differentiation of pheochromocytoma 12 cells. Adult neural stem cells cultured on the composites show an increased neuron&#8208;to&#8208;astrocyte ratio and higher synaptic connectivity. Moreover, primary hippocampal neurons cultured on composites maintain morphological synaptic features as well as their neuronal network activity evaluated by spontaneous calcium oscillations, which are comparable to neurons cultured under control conditions. These results indicate that the composites are promising materials that could indeed facilitate neuronal differentiation while maintaining neuronal homeostasis.

         <title>Evolving Devil's Staircase Magnetization from Tunable Charge Density Waves in Nonsymmorphic Dirac Semimetals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fractionally quantized Hall plateaus originate from translational symmetry breaking in 2D systems. It is also possible to observe similar quantization of other physical properties in bulk materials in the presence of coupled collective excitations. Such a state is realized and tuned by changing the electron count in CeSbTe. It also creates an idealized nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetal state in this compound.








Abstract
While several magnetic topological semimetals have been discovered in recent years, their band structures are far from ideal, often obscured by trivial bands at the Fermi energy. Square&#8208;net materials with clean, linearly dispersing bands show potential to circumvent this issue. CeSbTe, a square&#8208;net material, features multiple magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;controllable topological phases. Here, it is shown that in this material, even higher degrees of tunability can be achieved by changing the electron count at the square&#8208;net motif. Increased electron filling results in structural distortion and formation of charge density waves (CDWs). The modulation wave&#8208;vector evolves continuously leading to a region of multiple discrete CDWs and a corresponding complex &#8220;Devil's staircase&#8221; magnetic ground state. A series of fractionally quantized magnetization plateaus is observed, which implies direct coupling between CDW and a collective spin&#8208;excitation. It is further shown that the CDW creates a robust idealized nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetal, thus providing access to topological systems with rich&#160;magnetism.

         <title>Single&#8208;Junction Organic Photovoltaic Cell with 19% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By designing new donor/acceptor materials and combining a ternary blending strategy, a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.0% (certified value of 18.7%) in single&#8208;junction organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells is achieved. It is demonstrated that finely tuning the light utilization and photophysical processes of the active layer has great potential for further improving the PCEs of OPV cells.








Abstract
Improving power conversion efficiency (PCE) is important for broadening the applications of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. Here, a maximum PCE of 19.0% (certified value of 18.7%) is achieved in single&#8208;junction OPV cells by combining material design with a ternary blending strategy. An active layer comprising a new wide&#8208;bandgap polymer donor named PBQx&#8208;TF and a new low&#8208;bandgap non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA) named eC9&#8208;2Cl is rationally designed. With optimized light utilization, the resulting binary cell exhibits a good PCE of 17.7%. An NFA F&#8208;BTA3 is then added to the active layer as a third component to simultaneously improve the photovoltaic parameters. The improved light unitization, cascaded energy level alignment, and enhanced intermolecular packing result in open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.879&#160;V, short&#8208;circuit current density of 26.7&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and fill factor of 0.809. This study demonstrates that further improvement of PCEs of high&#8208;performance OPV cells requires fine tuning of the electronic structures and morphologies of the active layers.

The improved light unitization, cascaded energy level alignment, and enhanced intermolecular packing result in open-circuit voltage of 0.879&#160;V, short-circuit current density of 26.7&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and fill factor of 0.809. This study demonstrates that further improvement of PCEs of high-performance OPV cells requires fine tuning of the electronic structures and morphologies of the active layers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Thermopower of Saturated Molecules by Noncovalent Anchor&#8208;Induced Electron Doping of Single&#8208;Layer Graphene Electrode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Saturated molecules are not preferred in the research of organic thermoelectrics because of intrinsically wide bandgaps and poor thermopower. Graphene electrodes are demonstrated to be able to enhance thermopower of monolayers of saturated compounds. A noncovalent amine anchor induces the creation of in&#8208;gap states and n&#8208;type doping of graphene, thereby leading to an increased Seebeck coefficient relative to analogous covalent gold&#8211;thiolate monolayers.








Abstract
Enhancing thermopower is a key goal in organic and molecular thermoelectrics. Herein, it is shown that introducing noncovalent contact with a single&#8208;layer graphene (SLG) electrode improves the thermopower of saturated molecules as compared to the traditional gold&#8211;thiolate covalent contact. Thermoelectric junction measurements with a liquid&#8208;metal technique reveal that the value of Seebeck coefficient in large&#8208;area junctions based on n&#8208;alkylamine self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) on SLG is increased up to fivefold compared to the analogous junction based on n&#8208;alkanethiolate SAMs on gold. Experiments with Raman spectroscopy and field&#8208;effect transistor analysis indicate that such enhancements benefit from the creation of new in&#8208;gap states and electron doping through noncovalent interaction between the amine anchor and the SLG electrode, which leads to a reduced energy offset between the Fermi level and the transport channel. This work demonstrates that control of interfacial bonding nature in molecular junctions improves the Seebeck effect in saturated molecules.

         <title>2D Ti3C2Tx MXenes: Visible Black but Infrared White Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultralow infrared emissivity of the 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene is experimentally demonstrated. First&#8208;principles calculations confirm this discovery and reveal other MXenes such as Ti2CTx, Nb2CTx, and V2CTx are also low&#8208;emissivity materials. Such intrinsically visible black but infrared white materials that are rare in nature show great potential in solar&#8211;thermal conversion, multispectral camouflage, thermal insulation, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.








Abstract
Black inorganic materials with low infrared absorption/emission (or IR white) are rare in nature but highly desired in numerous areas, such as solar&#8211;thermal energy harvesting, multispectral camouflage, thermal insulation, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Due to the lack of spectral selectivity in intrinsic materials, such counter&#8208;intuitive properties are generally realized by constructing complicated subwavelength metamaterials with costly nanofabrication techniques. Here, the intrinsically low mid&#8208;IR emissivity (down to 10%) of the 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene is reported. Associated with a high solar absorptance (up to 90%), it embraces the best spectral selectivity among the reported intrinsic black solar&#8208;absorbing materials. Its appealing potential in several of the aforementioned areas is experimentally demonstrated. First&#8208;principles calculations reveal that the IR emissivity of MXene relies on both the nanoflake orientations and terminal groups, indicating great tunability. The calculations also suggest more potential low&#8208;emissivity MXenes including Ti2CTx, Nb2CTx, and V2CTx. This work opens the avenue to further exploration of a family of intrinsically low&#8208;emissivity materials with over 70 members.

         <title>Supersaturation&#8208;Controlled Growth of Monolithically Integrated Lead&#8208;Free Halide Perovskite Single&#8208;Crystalline Thin Film for High&#8208;Sensitivity Photodetectors</title>

A lead&#8208;free halide perovskite Cs3Bi2I9 single&#8208;crystalline thin film, with adjustable thickness and millimeter size, is directly integrated on various substrates including Si wafer, through a supersaturation&#8208;controlled method. Benefiting from the incommensurate lattice match and suitable thinness, this silicon&#8208;compatible perovskite photodetector is superior to most reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lead&#8208;free halide perovskite photodetectors.








Abstract
Monolithical integration of the promising optoelectronic material with mature and inexpensive silicon circuitry contributes to simplifying device geometry, enhancing performance, and expanding new functionalities. Herein, a lead&#8208;free halide perovskite Cs3Bi2I9 single&#8208;crystalline thin film (SCTF), with thickness ranging from 900&#160;nm to 4.1&#160;&#181;m and aspect ratio up to 1666, is directly integrated on various substrates including Si wafer, through a facile and low&#8208;temperature solution&#8208;processing method. The growth kinetics of the lead&#8208;free halide perovskite SCTF are elucidated by in situ observation, and the solution supersaturation is controlled to reduce the inverse&#8208;temperature crystallization nucleation density and elongate the evaporation growth. The excellent lattice match and band alignment between Si(111) and Cs3Bi2I9(001) facets promote photogenerated charge dissociation and extraction, resulting in boosting the photoelectric sensitivity by 10&#8211;200 times compared with photodetectors based on other substrates. More importantly, this silicon&#8208;compatible perovskite SCTF photodetector exhibits a high switching ratio of 3000 and a fast response of 1.5 &#181;s, which are higher than most reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lead&#8208;free halide perovskite photodetectors. This work not only gives an in&#8208;depth understanding of the perovskite precursor solution chemistry, but also demonstrates the great potential of monolithical integration of lead&#8208;free halide perovskite SCTF with a silicon wafer for high&#8208;performance photodetectors.

         <title>Exceptionally Robust Face&#8208;Sharing Motifs Enable Efficient and Durable Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 1D 5H&#8208;polytype Ba5Bi0.25Co3.75FeO14&#8722;&#948; oxide with high&#8208;valence face&#8208;sharing motifs is developed as a highly efficient and stable electrocatalyst for oxygen&#8208;evolving reaction. This exceptional face&#8208;sharing structure can be maintained even under high anodic potentials and accelerates the deprotonation step (*OOH&#160;+&#160;OH&#8722;&#160;=&#160;*OO&#160;+&#160;H2O&#160;+&#160;e&#8722;) via a steric inductive effect to promote lattice&#8208;oxygen participation.








Abstract
Corner&#8208;sharing oxides usually suffer from structural reconstruction during the bottleneck oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER) in water electrolysis. Therefore, introducing dynamically stable active sites in an alternative structure is urgent but challenging. Here, 1D 5H&#8208;polytype Ba5Bi0.25Co3.75FeO14&#8722;&#948; oxide with face&#8208;sharing motifs is identified as a highly active and stable candidate for alkaline OER. Benefiting from the stable face&#8208;sharing motifs with three couples of combined bonds, Ba5Bi0.25Co3.75FeO14&#8722;&#948; can maintain its local structures even under high OER potentials as evidenced by fast operando spectroscopy, contributing to a negligible performance degradation over 110&#160;h. Besides, the higher Co valence and smaller orbital bandgap in Ba5Bi0.25Co3.75FeO14&#8722;&#948; endow it with a much better electron transport ability than its corner&#8208;sharing counterpart, leading to a distinctly reduced overpotential of 308&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in 0.1&#160;m KOH. Further mechanism studies show that the short distance between lattice&#8208;oxygen sites in face&#8208;sharing Ba5Bi0.25Co3.75FeO14&#8722;&#948; can accelerate the deprotonation step (*OOH&#160;+&#160;OH&#8722;&#160;=&#160;*OO&#160;+&#160;H2O&#160;+&#160;e&#8722;) via a steric inductive effect to promote lattice&#8208;oxygen participation. In this work, not only is a new 1D face&#8208;sharing oxide with impressive OER performance discovered, but also a rational design of dynamic stable and active sites for sustainable energy systems is inaugurated.

Here, 1D 5H-polytype Ba&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.25&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;3.75&lt;/sub&gt;FeO&lt;sub&gt;14&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;&#948;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; oxide with face-sharing motifs is identified as a highly active and stable candidate for alkaline OER. Benefiting from the stable face-sharing motifs with three couples of combined bonds, Ba&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.25&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;3.75&lt;/sub&gt;FeO&lt;sub&gt;14&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;&#948;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; can maintain its local structures even under high OER potentials as evidenced by fast operando spectroscopy, contributing to a negligible performance degradation over 110&#160;h. Besides, the higher Co valence and smaller orbital bandgap in Ba&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.25&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;3.75&lt;/sub&gt;FeO&lt;sub&gt;14&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;&#948;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; endow it with a much better electron transport ability than its corner-sharing counterpart, leading to a distinctly reduced overpotential of 308&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 0.1&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; KOH. Further mechanism studies show that the short distance between lattice-oxygen sites in face-sharing Ba&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.25&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;3.75&lt;/sub&gt;FeO&lt;sub&gt;14&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;&#948;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; can accelerate the deprotonation step (*OOH&#160;+&#160;OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;=&#160;*OO&#160;+&#160;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&#160;+&#160;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) via a steric inductive effect to promote lattice-oxygen participation. In this work, not only is a new 1D face-sharing oxide with impressive OER performance discovered, but also a rational design of dynamic stable and active sites for sustainable energy systems is inaugurated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Passivation of the Buried Interface via Preferential Crystallization of 2D Perovskite on Metal Oxide Transport Layers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfacial nonradiative recombination limits the open&#8208;circuit voltage of perovskite solar cells. A buried interface passivation strategy is developed that can be used across metal oxide transport layers. Perovskite precursors containing large organic cations with high affinity for the substrate spontaneously form a 2D passivation layer on the underlying metal oxides, which reduces interfacial recombination by 72%.








Abstract
The open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of perovskite solar cells is limited by non&#8208;radiative recombination at perovskite/carrier transport layer (CTL) interfaces. 2D perovskite post&#8208;treatments offer a means to passivate the top interface; whereas, accessing and passivating the buried interface underneath the perovskite film requires new material synthesis strategies. It is posited that perovskite ink containing species that bind strongly to substrates can spontaneously form a passivating layer with the bottom CTL. The concept using organic spacer cations with rich &#63743;NH2 groups is implemented, where readily available hydrogens have large binding affinity to under&#8208;coordinated oxygens on the metal oxide substrate surface, inducing preferential crystallization of a thin 2D layer at the buried interface. The passivation effect of this 2D layer is examined using steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy: the 2D interlayer suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination at the buried perovskite/CTL interface, leading to a 72% reduction in surface recombination velocity. This strategy enables a 65&#160;mV increase in Voc for NiOx based p&#8211;i&#8211;n devices, and a 100&#160;mV increase in Voc for SnO2&#8208;based n&#8211;i&#8211;p devices. Inverted solar cells with 20.1% power conversion efficiency (PCE) for 1.70&#160;eV and 22.9% PCE for 1.55&#160;eV bandgap perovskites are demonstrated.

&lt;p&gt;Interfacial nonradiative recombination limits the open-circuit voltage of perovskite solar cells. A buried interface passivation strategy is developed that can be used across metal oxide transport layers. Perovskite precursors containing large organic cations with high affinity for the substrate spontaneously form a 2D passivation layer on the underlying metal oxides, which reduces interfacial recombination by 72%.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The open-circuit voltage (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;) of perovskite solar cells is limited by non-radiative recombination at perovskite/carrier transport layer (CTL) interfaces. 2D perovskite post-treatments offer a means to passivate the top interface; whereas, accessing and passivating the buried interface underneath the perovskite film requires new material synthesis strategies. It is posited that perovskite ink containing species that bind strongly to substrates can spontaneously form a passivating layer with the bottom CTL. The concept using organic spacer cations with rich &lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; groups is implemented, where readily available hydrogens have large binding affinity to under-coordinated oxygens on the metal oxide substrate surface, inducing preferential crystallization of a thin 2D layer at the buried interface. The passivation effect of this 2D layer is examined using steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy: the 2D interlayer suppresses non-radiative recombination at the buried perovskite/CTL interface, leading to a 72% reduction in surface recombination velocity. This strategy enables a 65&#160;mV increase in &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt; for NiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; based p&#8211;i&#8211;n devices, and a 100&#160;mV increase in &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt; for SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based n&#8211;i&#8211;p devices. Inverted solar cells with 20.1% power conversion efficiency (PCE) for 1.70&#160;eV and 22.9% PCE for 1.55&#160;eV bandgap perovskites are demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Strain&#8208;Gated Switching
Mechanical&#8208;strain&#8208;gated electric switches play a key role in sensing, soft robotics, and stretchable electronics. They typically operate with an &#8220;off&#8208;switch&#8221; function, and exhibit a decrease in conductivity upon an applied strain. In article number 2104769, Soosang Chae, Andreas Fery, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate a thin&#8208;film architecture that features the inverse behavior: &#8220;on&#8208;switch&#8221;: a strain&#8208;induced transition from insulating to metallic conductivity, spanning nine orders of magnitude in conductivity.

Self&#8208;Healing Devices
An innovative concept of a self&#8208;healed electrode&#8208;channel system employing ultrathin metallic copper monosulfide (CuS) and monolayered molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is demonstrated by  John Hong, SeungNam Cha, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2102091 for the design of defect&#8208;curable transistors and phototransistors. Excess sulfur adatoms from the CuS electrode spontaneously heal the defect sites in the MoS2 channel for record&#8208;high transistor and phototransistor performance.

Perovskite Thin Films
In article number 2103010, Xiaosheng Fang and co&#8208;workers report a supersaturation&#8208;controlled growth method for growing lead&#8208;free halide perovskite single&#8208;crystalline thin film on target substrates to realize facile monolithical integration. The sufficient thinness and incommensurate lattice matching contribute to high&#8208;sensitivity silicon&#8208;compatible photodetectors, better than advanced lead&#8208;free halide perovskite optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Anchoring Sites Engineering in Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Highly Efficient Electrochemical Energy Conversion Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with isolated metal atoms stabilized on various supports by surrounding atoms have emerged as a new frontier. The atomic structure and composition of anchoring sites significantly influence the catalytic performance of SACs. An overview of  the correlation between the property of anchoring points and catalytic performance to guide the design of SACs is provided.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have been at the frontier of research field in catalysis owing to the maximized atomic utilization, unique structures and properties. The atomically dispersed and catalytically active metal atoms are necessarily anchored by surrounding atoms. As such, the structure and composition of anchoring sites significantly influence the catalytic performance of SACs even with the same metal element. Significant progress has been made to understand structure&#8211;activity relationships at an atomic level, but in&#8208;depth understanding in precisely designing highly efficient SACs for the targeted reactions is still required. In this review, various anchoring sites in SACs are summarized and classified into five different types (doped heteroatoms, defect sites, surface atoms, metal sites, and cavity sites). Then, their impacts on catalytic performance are elucidated for electrochemical reactions based on their distance from the metal center (first coordination shell and beyond). Further, SACs anchored on two typical types of hosts, carbon&#8208; and metal&#8208;based materials, are highlighted, and the effects of anchoring points on achieving the desirable atomic structure, catalytic performance, and reaction pathways are elaborated. At last, insights and outlook to the SAC field based on current achievements and challenges are presented.

         <title>Shedding Light on the Role of Chemical Bond in Catalysis of Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 41, October 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent developments of catalytic nitrogen fixation are presented, digging deep into the atomic&#8208;scale insight of the reaction mechanism to clarify the ambiguity, listing powerful methods for enhancing the nitrogen fixation performance, and combining theory predictions with experimental results, all from a chemical bond perspective, which could facilitate deeper pondering and further  exploration in the nitrogen fixation field.








Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) and nitrates are essential for human society because of their widespread utilization for producing medicines, fibers, fertilizers, etc. In recent years, the development on nitrogen fixation under mild reaction conditions has attracted much attention. However, the very low conversion efficiency and ambiguous catalytic mechanism remain the major hurdles for the research of nitrogen fixation. This review aims to clarify the role of chemical bond in catalytic nitrogen fixation by summarizing and analyzing the recent development of nitrogen fixation research. In detail, the atomic&#8208;scale mechanism of nitrogen fixation reaction, the various methods to improve the nitrogen fixation performance, and the computational investigation of nitrogen fixation are discussed, all from a chemical bond perspective.

     alt="Shedding Light on the Role of Chemical Bond in Catalysis of Nitrogen Fixation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent developments of catalytic nitrogen fixation are presented, digging deep into the atomic-scale insight of the reaction mechanism to clarify the ambiguity, listing powerful methods for enhancing the nitrogen fixation performance, and combining theory predictions with experimental results, all from a chemical bond perspective, which could facilitate deeper pondering and further  exploration in the nitrogen fixation field.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and nitrates are essential for human society because of their widespread utilization for producing medicines, fibers, fertilizers, etc. In recent years, the development on nitrogen fixation under mild reaction conditions has attracted much attention. However, the very low conversion efficiency and ambiguous catalytic mechanism remain the major hurdles for the research of nitrogen fixation. This review aims to clarify the role of chemical bond in catalytic nitrogen fixation by summarizing and analyzing the recent development of nitrogen fixation research. In detail, the atomic-scale mechanism of nitrogen fixation reaction, the various methods to improve the nitrogen fixation performance, and the computational investigation of nitrogen fixation are discussed, all from a chemical bond perspective. It is hoped that this review could trigger more profound pondering and deeper exploration in the field of catalytic nitrogen fixation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Vertically Stacked Full Color Quantum Dots Phototransistor Arrays for High&#8208;Resolution and Enhanced Color&#8208;Selective Imaging</title>

Abstract
Color&#8208;selective multi&#8208;functional and multiplexed photodetectors have attracted considerable interest with the increasing demand for color filter free optoelectronics which can simultaneously process multispectral signal via minimized system complexity. The low efficiency of color&#8208;filter technology and conventional laterally pixelated photodetector array structures often limit opportunities for widespread realization of high&#8208;density photodetectors. Here, we develop low&#8208;temperature solution&#8208;processed vertically stacked full color quantum dot (QD) phototransistor arrays on plastic substrates for high&#8208;resolution color&#8208;selective photosensor applications. Particularly, the three different&#8208;sized/color (RGB) QDs were vertically stacked and pixelated via direct photo&#8208;patterning using a unique chelating chalcometallate ligand functioning both as solubilizing component and, after photoexposure, a semiconducting cement creating robust, insoluble, and charge&#8208;efficient QD layers localized in the a&#8208;IGZO transistor region, resulting in efficient wavelength&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;induced charge transfer. Thus, high&#8208;resolution vertically stacked full color QD photodetector arrays were successfully implemented with the density of 5,500 devices cm&#8211;2 on ultrathin flexible polymeric substrates with highly photosensitive characteristics such as photoresponsivity (1.1&#215;104 AW&#8211;1) and photodetectivity (1.1&#215;1018 Jones) as well as wide dynamic&#8208;ranges (&gt; 150&#160;dB).

         <title>Deterministic Shallow Dopant Implantation in Silicon with Detection Confidence Upper&#8208;Bound to 99.85% by Ion&#8208;Solid Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Silicon chips containing arrays of single dopant atoms could be the material of choice for both classical and quantum devices that exploit single donor spins. For example, group&#8208;V&#8208;donors implanted in isotopically purified 28Si crystals are attractive for large&#8208;scale quantum computers. Useful attributes include long nuclear and electron spin lifetimes of 31P, hyperfine clock transitions in 209Bi or electrically controllable 123Sb nuclear spins. Promising architectures require the ability to fabricate arrays of individual near&#8208;surface dopant atoms with high yield. Here we employ an on&#8208;chip detector electrode system with 70&#160;eV r.m.s. noise (&#8764;20 electrons) to demonstrate near room temperature implantation of single 14&#160;keV 31P+ ions. The physics model for the ion&#8208;solid interaction shows an unprecedented upper&#8208;bound single ion detection confidence of 99.85&#177;0.02% for near&#8208;surface implants. As a result, the practical controlled silicon doping yield is limited by materials engineering factors including surface gate oxides in which detected ions may stop. For a device with 6&#160;nm gate oxide and 14&#160;keV 31P+ implants we demonstrate a yield limit of 98.1%. Thinner gate oxides allow this limit to converge to the upper&#8208;bound. Deterministic single ion implantation can therefore be a viable materials engineering strategy for scalable dopant architectures in silicon&#160;devices.

         <title>Stretchable Soft Composites with strain&#8208;induced Architectured Color</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Colors enable interaction and communication between living species in a myriad of biological and artificial environments. While living organisms feature low&#8208;power mechanisms to dynamically control color in soft tissues, man&#8208;made color&#8208;changing devices remain predominantly rigid and energy&#8208;intensive. Here, we report soft architectured composites that display striking color changes when stretched in selective directions under ambient light with minimum power input. The orientation&#8208;dependent color change results from the rotation of reflective coated platelets that are embedded in a soft polymer matrix and pre&#8208;aligned in a well&#8208;defined architecture. The light reflected by the platelets generates structural color defined by the oxide coating on the platelet surface. By magnetically programming the initial orientation and spatial distribution of selected platelets within the soft matrix, we create composites with strain&#8208;modulated color&#8208;changing effects that cannot be achieved using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art technologies. The proposed concept of strain&#8208;induced architectured color can be harnessed to develop low&#8208;power smart stretchable displays, tactile synthetic skins and autonomous soft robotic devices that undergo fast and reversible color changes through the mechano&#8208;optic coupling programmed within their soft composite architecture.

         <title>Developing the non&#8208;developable: Creating curved&#8208;surface electronics from non&#8208;stretchable devices</title>

Abstract
The incorporation of electronics onto curved surfaces promises to bring new levels of intelligence to the ergonomic, aesthetic, aerodynamic, and optical surfaces that are ever&#8208;present in our lives. However, since many of these surfaces have two&#8208;dimensional (i.e., non&#8208;developable) curvature, they cannot be formed from the deformation of a flat non&#8208;stretchable sheet. This means that curved electronics cannot capitalize on the rapid technological advances taking place in the field of ultrathin electronics, since ultrathin devices, though ultra&#8208;flexible, are not stretchable. In this work, we present a shrink&#8208;based paradigm to apply such thin&#8208;film electronics to non&#8208;developable surfaces, expanding the capabilities of current non&#8208;developable electronics, and linking future developments in thin&#8208;film technology to similar developments in curved devices. We examine the wrinkling of parylene&#8208;based devices and the effects of shrinkage on common electrical components, culminating in shrinkable touch sensors and organic photovoltaics, laminated to various non&#8208;developable surfaces without loss of performance.

         <title>Tin Halide Perovskites: From Fundamental Properties to Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal halide perovskites have unique optical and electrical properties, which make them an excellent class of materials for a broad spectrum of optoelectronic applications. However, it is with photovoltaic devices that this class of materials has reached the apotheosis of popularity, and is the massive interests of a large community of researchers that has led to a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.5% only after 10 years from their first use. Nevertheless, such high performance is achieved with Pb&#8208;based compounds, which are toxic to the environment. Therefore, in the last years a considerable research effort has been focused to substitute Pb with other less toxic group IVA metals. Sn&#8208;based perovskites are the most promising alternative because of their band&#8208;gap close to the optimal value for photovoltaic applications, the strong optical absorption, and the good charge carrier mobilities. Nevertheless, the low defect tolerance, the fast crystallization, and the oxidative instability of tin halide perovskites has confined till now the power conversion efficiency to much lower values of the one obtained with Pb&#8208;based perovskites. We believe that fundamental understanding of the electronic properties and of the film formation process is imperative to bring Sn&#8208;based devices at the level of Pb&#8208;based one. With this review we aim to give a detailed overview of the crystallographic, photophysical, and optoelectronic properties of Sn&#8208;based perovskite compounds in their multiple forms from the 3D systems till low dimensional structures. At the end, recent progresses in Sn&#8208;based perovskite solar cells are reviewed, mainly focusing on the detail of the strategies adopted to improve the device performances. For each sub&#8208;topic the current challenges and the outlook are discussed, with the aim to stimulate the community to address the most important issues in a concerted manner.

         <title>Silk microneedle patch capable of on&#8208;demand multi&#8208;drug delivery to the brain for glioblastoma treatment</title>

Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor, and it is associated with poor prognosis because of invasive growth. To date, surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy remains the standard treatment strategy for GBM after the exact location of the tumor has been confirmed. However, challenges still exist for many GBM patients when surgery is difficult or impossible; in many cases, surgery cannot remove the tumor completely, because the tumor tends to spread into surrounding tissues. Herein, we report the design, fabrication and application of a heterogenous silk fibroin microneedle (SMN) patch for circumventing the blood&#8208;brain barrier and releasing multiple drugs directly to the tumor site for drug combination treatment. The biocompatible and biodegradable SMN patch can dissolve slowly over time, allowing the sustained release of multiple drugs at different concentrations over an extended period of time. Furthermore, it can be triggered remotely to induce rapid drug delivery at a designated stage after implantation. In the GBM mouse models with and without tumor resection in distinct cell lines, two clinically relevant chemotherapeutic agents(thrombin and temozolomide)and targeted drug (bevacizumab) were loaded into the SMN patch at different doses and with individually controlled release profiles. The drugs were spatiotemporally and sequentially delivered to the tumor site in the mouse brain during the dissolution of the SMN patch and maintained at levels above those effective for hemostasis, anti&#8208;angiogenesis and apoptosis of tumor cells. Device application was non&#8208;toxic and resulted in both decreased tumor volume and increased survival rate in mice. The SMN patch with on&#8208;demand multi&#8208;drug delivery has potential applications for the combined administration of multiple therapeutic drugs for the clinical treatment of brain tumors when other methods are insufficient.

         <title>Simultaneously blocking chemical crosstalk and internal short circuit via gel&#8208;stretching derived nanoporous non&#8208;shrinkage separator for safe lithium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Separator, an ionic permeable and electronic insulating membrane between cathode and anode, plays a crucial role in the electrochemical and safety performance of batteries. However, the commercial polyolefin separators not only suffer from inevitable thermal shrinkage at elevated temperature, but also fail to inhibit the hidden chemical crosstalk of reactive gases such as O2, leading to often reported thermal runaway (TR) and hence preventing large&#8208;scale implementation of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, a nanoporous non&#8208;shrinkage separator (GS&#8208;PI) was fabricated via a novel gel&#8208;stretching orientation approach to eliminate TR. In situ synchrotron small angle X&#8208;ray scattering during heating clearly showed that the as&#8208;prepared thin GS&#8208;PI separator exhibits superior mechanical tolerance at high temperature, thus effectively preventing internal short circuit. Meanwhile, the unique nanoporous structure design further blocks chemical crosstalk and the associated exothermic reactions. Accelerating Rate Calorimetry test revealed that the practical 1 Ah LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622)/graphite pouch cell using GS&#8208;PI nanoporous separator show a maximum temperature rise (dT/dtmax) of only 3.7&#160;&#176;C s&#8722;1 compared to 131.6&#160;&#176;C s&#8722;1 in the case of Al2O3@PE macroporous separator. Moreover, despite the reduced pore size, the GS&#8208;PI separator demonstrates better cycling stability than conventional Al2O3@PE separator at high temperature without sacrificing specific capacity and rate capability.

         <title>Ultrarobust and High&#8208;Performance Rotational Hydrodynamic Triboelectric Nanogenerator Enabled by Automatic Mode Switch and Charge Excitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is an emerging technology for the ambient mechanical energy harvesting, which provides a possibility to realize the wild environment monitor by self&#8208;powered sensing systems. However, TENG is limited in some practical applications as a result of low output performance (low charge density) and mechanical durability (material abrasion). Herein, an ultrarobust and high&#8208;performance rotational TENG enabled by automatic mode switch (contact mode in low speed and non&#8208;contact in high speed) and charge excitation is proposed. It displays excellent stability maintaining 94% electrical output after 72,000 cycles, much higher than that of the normal contact mode TENG (30%). Due to its high electrical stability and large electrical output, this TENG powers 944 green LEDs to brightness in series. Furthermore, by harvesting the water flow energy, various commercial capacitors can be charged fast, and the self&#8208;powered fire alarm, and self&#8208;powered temperature and humidity detection are realized. This work provides an ideal scheme for enhancing the mechanical durability, broadening the range of working frequency and improving the electrical output of TENG. In addition, the high performance hydrodynamic triboelectric nanogenerator demonstrated in this work would have great applications for Internet of Things in remote area.

         <title>Cycloruthenated Self&#8208;Assembly with Metabolic Inhibition to Efficiently Overcome Multidrug Resistance in Cancers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In this study we report the synthesis and the evaluation of the efficacy of a cycloruthenated complex, RuZ, to overcome multi&#8208;drug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells. RuZ could self&#8208;assemble into nanoaggregates in the cell culture medium and resulted in a high intracellular concentration of RuZ in MDR cancer cells. The self&#8208;assembly significantly decreased oxygen consumption and inhibited glycolysis, which decreased cellular ATP levels. The reduction in ATP levels and its low affinity for the ABCB1 and ABCG2 transporters (which mediate MDR) significantly increased the retention of RuZ by MDR cancer cells. Furthermore, RuZ increased cellular oxidative stress, inducing DNA damage, and in combination with the aforementioned effects of RuZ, increased the apoptosis of cancer cells. Proteomic profiling analysis suggested that the RuZ primarily decreased the expression of proteins that mediate glycolysis and aerobic mitochondrial respiration and increased the expression of proteins involved in apoptosis. RuZ inhibited the proliferation of 35 cancer cell lines, of which 7 cell lines were resistant to clinical drugs. It was also active in doxorubicin&#8208;resistant MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231/Adr mouse tumor xenograft. To the best of our knowledge, our results are the first to show that self&#8208;assembled cycloruthenated complexes are efficacious in inhibiting the growth of MDR cancer cells.

         <title>Mesenchymal Stem Cell&#8208;derived Extracellular Vesicles with High PD&#8208;L1 Expression for Autoimmune Diseases Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Autoimmune diseases are the third most common disease influencing the quality of life of many patients. Here, we develop a PD&#8208;L1+ mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) derived extracellular vesicles (MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1) using lentivirus&#8208;mediated gene transfection technology for reconfiguration of the local immune microenvironment of affected tissue in autoimmune diseases. MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 exhibits an impressive ability to regulate various activated immune cells to an immunosuppressed state in vitro. More importantly, in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)&#8208;induced ulcerative colitis (UC) and imiquimod&#8208;induced psoriasis mouse models, we observe a significantly high accumulation of MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 in the inflamed tissues compared to the PD&#8208;L1+ MSCs. Therapeutic efficiency in both UC and psoriasis mouse disease models is demonstrated using MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 to reshape the inflammatory ecosystem in the local immune context. We develop a technology using MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 as a natural delivery platform for autoimmune diseases treatment with high clinical potential.

&lt;p&gt;Autoimmune diseases are the third most common disease influencing the quality of life of many patients. Here, we develop a PD-L1+ mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-sEVs-PD-L1) using lentivirus-mediated gene transfection technology for reconfiguration of the local immune microenvironment of affected tissue in autoimmune diseases. MSC-sEVs-PD-L1 exhibits an impressive ability to regulate various activated immune cells to an immunosuppressed state in vitro. More importantly, in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) and imiquimod-induced psoriasis mouse models, we observe a significantly high accumulation of MSC-sEVs-PD-L1 in the inflamed tissues compared to the PD-L1+ MSCs. Therapeutic efficiency in both UC and psoriasis mouse disease models is demonstrated using MSC-sEVs-PD-L1 to reshape the inflammatory ecosystem in the local immune context. We develop a technology using MSC-sEVs-PD-L1 as a natural delivery platform for autoimmune diseases treatment with high clinical potential.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Design Quasi&#8208;MOF Nanospheres as Dynamic Electrocatalyst toward Accelerated Sulfur Reduction Reaction for High Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>

Abstract
Lithium sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries have been considered as one of the most promising next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries owing to its high energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the sluggish kinetics of the sulfur reduction reaction process, which is so far insufficiently explored, still impedes its practical application.&#160;Metal organic frameworks (MOF) are widely investigated as&#160;sulfur immobilizer, but the interactions and catalytic activity of lithium polysulfides (LiPs) on metal nodes are weak due to the presence of organic ligands. Herein, we present a strategy to design Quasi&#8208;MOF nanospheres, which has a transition&#8208;state structure between MOF and metal oxide, via controlled ligand exchange strategy to serve as sulfur electrocatalyst. The Quasi&#8208;MOF not only inherits the porous structure of MOF, but also exposes abundant metal nodes to act as active sites, rendering strong LiPs absorbability. The reversible deligandation/ligandation of Quasi&#8208;MOF and its impact on the durability of catalyst over the course of electrochemical process has been acknowledged, which confers a remarkable catalytic activity. Attributed to these structural advantages, Quasi&#8208;MOF delivers a decent discharge capacity and low capacity fading rate over long&#8208;term cycling. This work not only offers insight into the rational design of Quasi&#8208;MOF based composite, but also provides guidance for the application in Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Asymmetric Elimination Reaction on Chiral Metal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The production of enantiopure materials and molecules is of uttermost relevance in research and industry in numerous contexts, ranging from non&#8208;linear optics to asymmetric synthesis. In the context of the latter, we have investigated dehalogenation, which is an essential reaction step for a broad class of chemical reactions. Specifically, dehalogenation of prochiral 5&#8208;bromo&#8208;7&#8208;methylbenz(a)anthracene (BMA) on prototypical, chiral, intermetallic PdGa{111} surfaces under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Enantioselective halogen elimination is demonstrated by combining temperature&#8208;programmed x&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and density functional theory. On the PdGa{111} surfaces, the difference in debromination temperatures for the two BMA surface enantiomers amounts up to unprecedented 46 K. The significant dependence of the dehalogenation temperature of the BMA surface enantiomers on the atomic termination of the PdGa{111} surfaces, implies that the ensemble effect is pronounced in this reaction step. These findings evidence enantiospecific control and hence promote intrinsically chiral crystals for asymmetric on&#8208;surface synthesis.

         <title>Processing of Self&#8208;healing Polymers for Soft Robotics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Soft robots are, due to their softness, inherently safe and adapt well to unstructured environments. However, they are prone to various damage types. Self&#8208;healing polymers address this vulnerability. Self&#8208;healing soft robots can recover completely from macroscopic damage, extending their lifetime. For developing healable soft robots, various formative and additive manufacturing methods have been exploited to shape self&#8208;healing polymers into complex structures. Additionally, several novel manufacturing techniques, noted as (re)assembly binding techniques that are specific to self&#8208;healing polymers, have been created. This paper reviews the wide variety of processing techniques of self&#8208;healing polymers for robotics available in literature, and thoroughly discusses limitations and opportunities. Based on defined requirements for soft robots, these techniques are critically compared and validated. A strong focus is drawn to the reversible covalent and (physico)chemical cross&#8208;links present in the self&#8208;healing polymers that do not only endow healability to the resulting soft robotic components, but are also beneficial in many manufacturing techniques. They solve current obstacles in soft robots, including the formation of robust multi&#8208;material parts, recyclability and stress relaxation. This review bridges two promising research fields, and guides the reader towards selecting a suitable processing method based on a self&#8208;healing polymer and the intended soft robotics&#160;application.

         <title>Optoelectronic Properties of Low&#8208;Bandgap Halide Perovskites for Solar Cell Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;bandgap tin&#8208;containing halide perovskites have recently demonstrated impressive photovoltaic performances owing to their unique optoelectronic properties, which are yet to be fully explored. A perspective on the absorption, carrier generation, recombination, and transport phenomena in these materials is provided, underscoring an interesting interplay between doping, defects, and degradation that needs to be controlled for future optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Riding on the coat tails of rapid developments in single&#8208;junction halide perovskite solar cells, all&#8208;perovskite multijunction solar cells have recently garnered significant attention, with the highest power&#8208;conversion efficiency already reaching 25.6%. Much of this progress has been fueled by the rapid rise in the photovoltaic performance of low&#8208;bandgap halide perovskite absorbers, materials, which, to date, have only been achievable by the partial or complete substitution of lead with tin. However, much room still exists to develop a more critical understanding of key material properties in these low&#8208;bandgap perovskites. Herein, the key optoelectronic properties of absorption, carrier generation, recombination, and transport in these tin&#8208;containing perovskites are discussed, showing that intrinsic doping distinctively impacts many of these properties, thereby rendering this class of halide perovskites unique within the family. Current understanding of the mechanisms that degrade optoelectronic performance in these materials and the corresponding devices are also summarized. These collective results highlight an important interplay between doping, defects, and degradation that will need to be controlled. Finally, the current gaps in understanding of these low&#8208;bandgap perovskites are outlined, thereby providing guidelines for further research, which will unlock their full potential for realizing a plethora of high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Powered Piezo&#8208;Bioelectric Device Regulates Tendon Repair&#8208;Associated Signaling Pathways through Modulation of Mechanosensitive Ion Channels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under physiological conditions, ion&#8208;channels activity limit membrane depolarization and regulate ion concentration&#8208;dependent signaling cascades. In response to injury or mechanical loading, the activity and expression of the ion&#8208;channels increases, and unspecific tissue&#8208;repair signaling pathways activate, resulting in ectopic calcification. By modulating the mechanosensitive ion&#8208;channels&#8217; expression, electromechanical stimulation regulates specific signaling pathways activation to promote tendon over bone formation processes.








Abstract
Tendon disease constitutes an unmet clinical need and remains a critical challenge in the field of orthopaedic surgery. Innovative solutions are required to overcome the limitations of current tendon grafting approaches, and bioelectronic therapies show promise in treating musculoskeletal diseases, accelerating functional recovery through the activation of tissue regeneration&#8208;specific signaling pathways. Self&#8208;powered bioelectronic devices, particularly piezoelectric materials, represent a paradigm shift in biomedicine, negating the need for battery or external powering and complementing existing mechanotherapy to accelerate the repair processes. Here, the dynamic response of tendon cells to a piezoelectric collagen&#8208;analogue scaffold comprised of aligned nanoscale fibers made of the ferroelectric material poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene) is shown. It is demonstrated that motion&#8208;powered electromechanical stimulation of tendon tissue through piezo&#8208;bioelectric device results in ion channel modulation in vitro and regulates specific tissue regeneration signaling pathways. Finally, the potential of the piezo&#8208;bioelectronic device in modulating the progression of tendinopathy&#8208;associated processes in vivo, using a rat Achilles acute injury model is shown. This study indicates that electromechanical stimulation regulates mechanosensitive ion channel sensitivity and promotes tendon&#8208;specific over non&#8208;tenogenic tissue repair processes.

By modulating the mechanosensitive ion-channels&#8217; expression, electromechanical stimulation regulates specific signaling pathways activation to promote tendon over bone formation processes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tendon disease constitutes an unmet clinical need and remains a critical challenge in the field of orthopaedic surgery. Innovative solutions are required to overcome the limitations of current tendon grafting approaches, and bioelectronic therapies show promise in treating musculoskeletal diseases, accelerating functional recovery through the activation of tissue regeneration-specific signaling pathways. Self-powered bioelectronic devices, particularly piezoelectric materials, represent a paradigm shift in biomedicine, negating the need for battery or external powering and complementing existing mechanotherapy to accelerate the repair processes. Here, the dynamic response of tendon cells to a piezoelectric collagen-analogue scaffold comprised of aligned nanoscale fibers made of the ferroelectric material poly(vinylidene fluoride-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-trifluoroethylene) is shown. It is demonstrated that motion-powered electromechanical stimulation of tendon tissue through piezo-bioelectric device results in ion channel modulation in vitro and regulates specific tissue regeneration signaling pathways. Finally, the potential of the piezo-bioelectronic device in modulating the progression of tendinopathy-associated processes in vivo, using a rat Achilles acute injury model is shown. This study indicates that electromechanical stimulation regulates mechanosensitive ion channel sensitivity and promotes tendon-specific over non-tenogenic tissue repair processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemistry&#8208;Induced Improvements of Mechanical Strength, Self&#8208;Healing, and Interfacial Adhesion of Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemistry strategy to enable functional improvements of hydrogels is reported. In comparison with an untreated one, the mechanical strength can be improved by 7.37 times, the interfacial adhesion energy to 1400 J m&#8722;2, and the healing efficiency to 100%, showing a general feature for the rapid generation of multifunctional hydrogels for biomedical and engineering applications.








Abstract
Hydrogels have demonstrated great potential in biomedical and engineering areas. To improve the physical performance, development of efficient physical/chemical protocols is essential. Herein, an electrochemistry functionalization strategy that is capable of enabling the functional improvements of hydrogel is reported. The electrochemistry functionalization is demonstrated on a hydrogel model of polyacrylamide (PAAm)@&#954;&#8208;carrageenan. The electrochemistry reaction generates metal ions (Fe3+) that migrate and coordinate with the sulfate groups of &#954;&#8208;carrageenan resulting in the prominent function improvements. In comparison with untreated PAAm@&#954;&#8208;carrageenan hydrogel, it can improve the mechanical strength by 7.37 times, and can increase the interfacial adhesion energy of the hydrogel on a glass surface from 0 to 1400 J m&#8722;2, stronger than the bonding strength of tendons (adhesion energy: &#8776;800 J m&#8722;2). Two pieces of hydrogel strips integrate into an intact structure by the electrochemistry functionalization, where the healing efficiency reaches 100% in comparison to the untreated hydrogel. The most significant development is that it enables functional patterning on the hydrogel by the electrode assembly, which provides the hydrogel with modular sensitivity to external pressure. Therefore, it can be a general protocol for rapid generation of multifunctional hydrogels for biomedical and engineering developments.

         <title>Large&#8208;Sized Graphene Oxide Nanosheets Increase DC&#8211;T&#8208;Cell Synaptic Contact and the Efficacy of DC Vaccines against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel material&#8208;based method of regulating dendritic cell (DC)&#8211;T&#8208;cell synaptic contact for adoptive DC vaccine engineering is reported. Graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets serve as a &#8220;nanozipper&#8221; or &#8220;double&#8208;sided tape&#8221; facilitating the formation and aggregation of DC&#8211;T&#8208;cell immune synapses to elicit robust cytotoxic T cell immune responses against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection. Cytoskeleton&#8208;dependent membrane&#8208;positioning of intercellular cell adhesion molecule&#8208;1 (ICAM&#8208;1) might be the underlying mechanism.








Abstract
Dendritic cell (DC) vaccines are used for cancer and infectious diseases, albeit with limited efficacy. Modulating the formation of DC&#8211;T&#8208;cell synapses may greatly increase their efficacy. The effects of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets on DCs and DC&#8211;T&#8208;cell synapse formation are evaluated. In particular, size&#8208;dependent interactions are observed between GO nanosheets and DCs. GOs with diameters of &gt;1 &#181;m (L&#8208;GOs) demonstrate strong adherence to the DC surface, inducing cytoskeletal reorganization via the RhoA&#8208;ROCK&#8208;MLC pathway, while relatively small GOs (&#8776;500 nm) are predominantly internalized by DCs. Furthermore, L&#8208;GO treatment enhances DC&#8211;T&#8208;cell synapse formation via cytoskeleton&#8208;dependent membrane positioning of integrin ICAM&#8208;1. L&#8208;GO acts as a &#8220;nanozipper,&#8221; facilitating the aggregation of DC&#8211;T&#8208;cell clusters to produce a stable microenvironment for T cell activation. Importantly, L&#8208;GO&#8208;adjuvanted DCs promote robust cytotoxic T cell immune responses against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike 1, leading to &gt;99.7% viral RNA clearance in mice infected with a clinically isolated SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 strain. These findings highlight the potential value of nanomaterials as DC vaccine adjuvants for modulating DC&#8211;T&#8208;cell synapse formation and provide a basis for the development of effective COVID&#8208;19 vaccines.

         <title>Reproducible X&#8208;ray Imaging with a Perovskite Nanocrystal Scintillator Embedded in a Transparent Amorphous Network Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;limited growth strategy is proposed to construct CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, which features X&#8208;imaging with excellent resolution (16.8&#160;lp&#160;mm&#8722;1). More importantly, the blurred X&#8208;ray images of the damaged perovskite NCs, due to irradiation at high dose rate, are well refreshed by a thermal treatment. This discovery broadens the research and application of the scintillators and opens a new chapter.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites are emerging scintillator materials in X&#8208;ray detection and imaging. However, the vulnerable structure of perovskites triggers unreliable performance when they are utilized in X&#8208;ray detectors under cumulative dose irradiation. Herein, a self&#8208;limited growth strategy is proposed to construct CsPbBr3 nanocrystals that are embedded in a transparent amorphous network structure, featuring X&#8208;imaging with excellent resolution (&#8776;16.8&#160;lp&#160;mm&#8722;1), and fast decay time (&#964;&#160;=&#160;27&#160;ns). Interestingly, it is found that the performance degradation of the scintillator, caused by the damage from high&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation, can be fully recovered after a facile thermal treatment process. This indicates a superior recycling behavior of the explored perovskites scintillator for practical applications. The recoverability of the as&#8208;explored scintillator is attributed to the low atom&#8208;migration rate in the amorphous network with high&#8208;viscosity (1&#160;&#215;&#160;1014&#160;cP). This result highlights the practical settlement of the promising perovskites for long&#8208;term, cost&#8208;effective scintillator devices.

         <title>Adaptive Cylindrical Wireless Metasurfaces in Clinical Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metasurface with homogeneous field distribution and nonlinear resonant modes is proposed. Adaptability is achieved using nonlinear elements, enabling the metasurface to be applicable to all clinical sequences without any parameters modified, also allowing two to four times signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio enhancement. The proposed design paves the way for the clinical applications of metasurfaces in magnetic resonance imaging.








Abstract
The signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) is one of the most important criteria for evaluating the image quality in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and metasurfaces with unique electromagnetic properties provide a novel method for SNR improvement. However, their applications in clinical MRI are highly restricted by the inhomogeneous enhancement of the magnetic field and interference in the radio frequency (RF) transmitting field. In this study, an adaptive cylindrical wireless metasurface (ACWM) with homogeneous field enhancement and adaptive resonant modes is reported. The ACWM automatically switches its resonant modes between the partial (transmitting period) and whole (receiving period) resonance, which enables it to not only eliminate the interference in RF transmitting field, but also greatly enhance the SNR. Its adaptability also makes the ACWM applicable to all common clinical sequences without any modifications in the scan parameters. The SNR of MRI images of the human wrist, acquired with ACWM, is two to four times compared with the conventional coil. This work offers a practical control method to fill the scientific knowledge gaps between the preclinical research and medical applications for metasurfaces, and suggests a novel and powerful tool for diagnosing and evaluating human diseases.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Membrane&#8208;Derived Nanoparticles with Notch&#8208;1 Suppressor Delivery Promote Hypoxic Cell&#8211;Cell Packing and Inhibit Angiogenesis Acting as a Two&#8208;Edged Sword</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell&#8208;derived nanoparticles (CMNPs) promote physical tightening of cell&#8211;cell interactions and cell packing, thereby inducing hypoxia as a favorable setting for cancer progression and cartilage development. The conjugation of aptamers to CMNPs suppresses Notch&#8208;1 signaling&#8208;mediated angiogenesis with consequent activation of anti&#8208;cancer and chondroprotective effects (&#8220;two&#8208;edged sword&#8221;) in a xenograft model of human laryngeal cancer.








Abstract
Cell&#8211;cell interactions regulate intracellular signaling via reciprocal contacts of cell membranes in tissue regeneration and cancer growth, indicating a critical need of membrane&#8208;derived tools in studying these processes. Hence, cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;derived nanoparticles (CMNPs) are produced using tonsil&#8208;derived mesenchymal stem cells (TMSCs) from children owing to their short doubling time. As target cell types, laryngeal cancer cells are compared to&#160;bone&#8208;marrow&#8208;derived MSCs (BMSCs) because of their cartilage damaging and chondrogenic characteristics, respectively. Treating spheroids of these cell types with CMNPs exacerbates&#160;interspheroid&#160;hypoxia with robust maintenance of the cell&#8211;cell interaction signature for 7 days. Both cell types prefer a hypoxic environment, as opposed to blood vessel formation that is absent in cartilage but is required for cancer growth. Hence, angiogenesis is inhibited by displaying the Notch&#8208;1 aptamer on CMNPs. Consequently, laryngeal cancer growth is suppressed efficiently in contrast to improved chondroprotection observed in a series of cell and animal experiments using a xenograft mouse model of laryngeal cancer.&#160;Altogether, CMNPs execute&#160;a two&#8208;edged sword function of&#160;inducing hypoxic cell&#8211;cell packing, followed by suppressing angiogenesis to promote&#160;laryngeal cancer death and chondrogenesis&#160;simultaneously.&#160;This study presents a previously unexplored therapeutic strategy for anti&#8208;cancer and chondroprotective treatment using CMNPs.

         <title>Exceptionally High Blocking Temperature of 17 K in a Surface&#8208;Supported Molecular Magnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sub&#8208;monolayers of Dy2@C80(CH2Ph) dimetallofullerene single&#8208;molecule magnets are prepared on a graphene monolayer by electrospray deposition. Magnetic hysteresis and relaxation time measurements show that the magnetic moment remains stable for 100 s at 17 K, marking the blocking temperature TB(100), being not only in excellent agreement with that of the bulk but also representing by far the highest one detected for a surface&#8208;supported single&#8208;molecule magnet.








Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) are among the most promising building blocks for future magnetic data storage or quantum computing applications, owing to magnetic bistability and long magnetic relaxation times. The practical device integration requires realization of 2D surface assemblies of SMMs, where each magnetic unit shows magnetic relaxation being sufficiently slow at application&#8208;relevant temperatures. Using X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray magnetic circular dichroism, it is shown that sub&#8208;monolayers of Dy2@C80(CH2Ph) dimetallofullerenes prepared on graphene by electrospray deposition exhibit magnetic behavior fully comparable to that of the bulk. Magnetic hysteresis and relaxation time measurements show that the magnetic moment remains stable for 100 s at 17 K, marking the blocking temperature TB(100), being not only in excellent agreement with that of the bulk sample but also representing by far the highest one detected for a surface&#8208;supported single&#8208;molecule magnet. The reported findings give a boost to the efforts to stabilize and address the spin degree of freedom in molecular magnets aiming at the realization of SMM&#8208;based spintronic units.

         <title>Evaporation&#8208;Induced rGO Coatings for Highly Sensitive and Non&#8208;Invasive Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer in the PSA Gray Zone</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A circulating tumor cell (CTC)&#8208;chip based on evaporation&#8208;induced wrinkled reduced graphene oxide coating can achieve highly sensitive and non&#8208;invasive diagnosis of prostate cancer in the prostate&#8208;specific antigen (PSA) gray zone. Compared with the low diagnostic sensitivity (58.3%) of regular PSA&#8208;based tests, a combination of CTC detection and PSA&#8208;based tests via machine&#8208;learning analysis can greatly upgrade the diagnostic sensitivity of this disease to 91.7%.








Abstract
The prostate&#8208;specific antigen (PSA) has been widely used for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer during routine check&#8208;ups. However, the low sensitivity of regular PSA tests in the PSA gray zone often means that patients are required to undergo further invasive needle biopsy for the diagnosis of prostate cancer, which may lead to potential overdiagnosis and overtreatment. In this study, a circulating tumor cell (CTC)&#8208;chip based on an evaporation&#8208;induced reduced graphene oxide (rGO) coating is presented, which enables a highly specific and non&#8208;invasive diagnosis of prostate cancer in the PSA gray zone. During the evaporation process of the rGO dispersion, the Marangoni effect induces the self&#8208;assembly of a hierarchical micro/nanowrinkled rGO coating, which can capture CTCs after subsequent surface modification of capture agents. Compared to the low diagnostic sensitivity (58.3%) of regular PSA tests, a combination of CTC detection and PSA&#8208;based hematological tests via machine&#8208;learning analysis can greatly upgrade the diagnostic sensitivity of this disease to 91.7% in clinical trial. Therefore, this study provides a non&#8208;invasive alternative with high sensitivity for the diagnosis of prostate cancer in the PSA gray zone.

         <title>Fused&#8208;Silica 3D Chiral Metamaterials via Helium&#8208;Assisted Microcasting Supporting Topologically Protected Twist Edge Resonances with High Mechanical Quality Factors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel helium&#8208;assisted microcasting approach is introduced to fabricate 3D fused&#8208;silica microstructures. For a 3D chiral fused&#8208;silica metamaterial beam, the existence of topologically protected twist&#8208;edge resonances with large mechanical quality factors of 2850 is demonstrated. The microcasting approach can likely be translated to many other materials, and to complex architectures that are not amenable to direct 3D laser printing.








Abstract
It is predicted theoretically that a 1D diatomic chain of 3D chiral cells can support a topological bandgap that allows for translating a small time&#8208;harmonic axial movement at one end of the chain into a resonantly enhanced large rotation of an edge state at the other end. This edge state is topologically protected such that an arbitrary mass of a mirror at the other end does not shift the eigenfrequency out of the bandgap. Herein, this complex 3D laser&#8208;beam&#8208;scanner microstructure is realized in fused&#8208;silica form. A novel microcasting approach is introduced that starts from a hollow polymer cast made by standard 3D laser nanoprinting. The cast is evacuated and filled with helium, such that a highly viscous commercial glass slurry is sucked in. After UV curing and thermal debinding of the polymer, the fused&#8208;silica glass is sintered at 1225&#160;&#176;C under vacuum. Detailed optical measurements reveal a mechanical quality factor of the twist&#8208;edge resonance of 2850 at around 278&#160;kHz resonance frequency under ambient conditions. The microcasting approach can likely be translated to many other glasses, to metals and ceramics, and to complex architectures that are not or not yet amenable to direct 3D laser printing.

         <title>Manipulating the Local Coordination and Electronic Structures for Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic Ni&#8211;Fe selenide&#8208;derived (oxy)hydroxide nanocage electrocatalysts are in situ generated by inheriting the structure of the pre&#8208;catalyst. The successful manipulation of the local coordination and electronic structures of the electrocatalyst enables superior electrocatalytic activity and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based nanomaterials can exhibit extraordinary electrocatalytic performance toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by harnessing the structural evolution during catalysis and the synergistic effect between elements. However, the structure of active centers in bimetallic/multimetallic catalysts is under long&#8208;time debate in the catalysis community. Here, an efficient bimetallic Ni&#8211;Fe selenide&#8208;derived OER electrocatalyst is reported and the structure&#8211;activity correlation during the OER evolution studied. By combining experiments and theoretical calculations,&#160;a conceptual advance is provided, in that the local coordination structure distortion and disordering of active sites inherited from the pre&#8208;catalyst and post&#8208;formed by a further reconstruction are responsible for boosting the OER performance. The active center is identified on Ni sites showing moderate bindings with oxygenous intermediates rather than Fe sites with strong and poisonous adsorptions. These findings provide crucial understanding in manipulating the local coordination and electronic structures toward rational design and fabrication of efficient OER electrocatalysts.

         <title>Optimizing Electronic Quality Factor toward High&#8208;Performance Ge1&#8722;x&#8722;yTaxSbyTe Thermoelectrics: The Role of Transition Metal Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nexus between electronic quality factor and thermoelectric figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;doped GeTe, which can serve as a facile yet efficient descriptor for high&#8208;throughput screening of good thermoelectric materials, is explained. To clarify this point, Ta&#8208;doped GeTe is designed with optimized electronic quality factor, rendering a figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit over 2.0 and a conceptional efficiency over 15%.








Abstract
Owing to high intrinsic figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit implemented by multi&#8208;band valleytronics, GeTe&#8208;based thermoelectric materials are promising for medium&#8208;temperature applications. Transition metals are widely used as dopants for developing high&#8208;performance GeTe thermoelectric materials. Herein, relevant work is critically reviewed to establish a correlation among transition metal doping, electronic quality factor, and figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit of GeTe. From first&#8208;principle calculations, it is found that Ta, as an undiscovered dopant in GeTe, can effectively converge energy offset between light and heavy conduction band extrema to enhance effective mass at high temperature. Such manipulation is verified by the increased Seebeck coefficient of synthesized Ge1&#8722;x&#8722;yTaxSbyTe samples from 160 to 180 &#181;V K&#8722;1 at 775 K upon doping Ta, then to 220 &#181;V K&#8722;1 with further alloying Sb. Characterization using electron microscopy also reveals the unique herringbone structure associated with multi&#8208;scale lattice defects induced by Ta doping, which greatly hinder phonon propagation to decrease thermal conductivity. As a result, a figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit of &#8776;2.0 is attained in the Ge0.88Ta0.02Sb0.10Te sample, reflecting a maximum heat&#8208;to&#8208;electricity efficiency up to 17.7% under a temperature gradient of 400 K. The rationalized beneficial effects stemming from Ta doping is an important observation that will stimulate new exploration toward high&#8208;performance GeTe&#8208;based thermoelectric materials.

         <title>A Powerful One&#8208;Step Puffing Carbonization Method for Construction of Versatile Carbon Composites with High&#8208;Efficiency Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A powerful one&#8208;step puffing carbonization technology is proposed to synthesize versatile multiscale carbon&#8208;based composites (e.g. carbon/metal oxides, carbon/metal carbides, carbon/metal sulfides, carbon/metals, metal/semiconductors, etc.) with controlled morphology, adjustable dimensions and tunable composition on a large scale. As a representative example, a sulfur&#8208;doped cross&#8208;linked puffed carbon (SCPC)/Li2S electrode shows extraordinary performance with superior rate capability and ultrastable cycling life.








Abstract
Carbon materials play a critical role in the advancement of electrochemical energy storage and conversion. Currently, it is still a great challenge to fabricate versatile carbon&#8208;based composites with controlled morphology, adjustable dimension, and tunable composition by a one&#8208;step synthesis process. In this work, a powerful one&#8208;step maltose&#8208;based puffing carbonization technology is reported to construct multiscale carbon&#8208;based composites on large scale. A quantity of composite examples (e.g., carbon/metal oxides, carbon/metal nitrides, carbon/metal carbides, carbon/metal sulfides, carbon/metals, metal/semiconductors, carbon/carbons) are prepared and demonstrated with required properties. These well&#8208;designed composites show advantages of large porosity, hierarchical porous structure, high conductivity, tunable components, and proportion. The formation mechanism of versatile carbon composites is attributed to the puffing&#8208;carbonization of maltose plus in situ carbothermal reaction between maltose and precursors. As a representative example, Li2S is in situ implanted into a hierarchical porous cross&#8208;linked puffed carbon (CPC) matrix to verify its application in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. The designed S&#8208;doped CPC/Li2S cathode shows superior electrochemical performance with higher rate capacity (621 mAh g&#8211;1 at 2 C), smaller polarization and enhanced long&#8208;term cycles as compared to other counterparts. The research provides a general way for the construction of multifunctional component&#8208;adjustable carbon composites for advanced energy storage and conversion.

         <title>Rational Design of Highly Stable and Active MXene&#8208;Based Bifunctional ORR/OER Double&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni1/Ni2&#8208; and Fe1/Ni2&#8208;modified MXene&#8208;based double&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) show the most promising bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic performances. The bifunctional catalytic activities of DACs improve with increasing strain. Theoretical models are presented for plotting the polarization curves of OER/ORR catalysis to demonstrate the bifunctional catalytic performance of the studied catalysts.








Abstract
Designing highly active and bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts has attracted great interest toward metal&#8211;air batteries. Herein, an efficient solution to the search for MXene&#8208;based bifunctional catalysts is proposed by introducing non&#8208;noble metals such as Fe/Co/Ni at the surfaces. These results indicate that the ultrahigh activities in Ni1/Ni2&#8208; and Fe1/Ni2&#8208;modified MXene&#8208;based double&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) for bifunctional ORR/OER are better than those of well&#8208;known unifunctional catalysts with low overpotentials, such as Pt(111) for the ORR and IrO2(110) for the OER. Strain can profoundly regulate the catalytic activities of MXene&#8208;based DACs, providing a novel pathway for tunable catalytic behavior in flexible MXenes. An electrochemical model, based on density functional theory and theoretical polarization curves, is proposed to reveal the underlying mechanisms, in agreement with experimental results. Electronic structure analyses indicate that the excellent catalytic activities in the MXene&#8208;based DACs are attributed to the electron&#8208;capturing capability and synergistic interactions between Fe/Co/Ni adsorbents and MXene substrate. These findings not only reveal promising candidates for MXene&#8208;based bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts but also provide new theoretical insights into rationally designing noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free bifunctional DACs.

         <title>Orbital Angular Momentum from Self&#8208;Assembled Concentric Nanoparticle Rings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Concentric rings of plasmonic nanoparticles are fabricated by self&#8208;assembling supramolecular nanocomposites on lithographically patterned surfaces. After assembly, the arrays of concentric rings generate high&#8208;quality orbital angular momentum (OAM). Due to their unique ability to self&#8208;regulate the distribution of each building block, supramolecular nanocomposites are a robust assembly platform. In this work, they accommodate variations in pattern dimension, nanoparticle loading, and nanoparticle ring size.








Abstract
Ring&#8208;shaped nanostructures can focus, filter, and manipulate electromagnetic waves, but are challenging to incorporate into devices using standard nanofabrication techniques. Directed self&#8208;assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) on lithographically patterned templates has successfully been used to fabricate concentric rings and spirals as etching masks. However, this method is limited by BCP phase behavior and material selection. Here, a straightforward approach to generate ring&#8208;shaped nanoparticle assemblies in thin films of supramolecular nanocomposites is demonstrated. DSA is used to guide the formation of concentric rings with radii spanning 150&#8211;1150&#160;nm and ring widths spanning 30&#8211;60&#160;nm. When plasmonic nanoparticles are used, ring nanodevice arrays can be fabricated in one step, and the completed devices produce high&#8208;quality orbital angular momentum (OAM). Nanocomposite DSA simplifies and streamlines nanofabrication by producing metal structures without etching or deposition steps; it also introduces interparticle coupling as a new design axis. Detailed analysis of the nanoparticle ring assemblies confirms that the supramolecular system self&#8208;regulates the spatial distribution of its components, and thus exhibits a degree of flexibility absent in DSA of BCPs alone, where structures are determined by polymer&#8208;pattern incommensurability. The present studies also provide guidelines for developing self&#8208;regulating DSA as an alternative to incommensurability&#8208;driven methods.

         <title>A Supramolecular Antidote to Macromolecular Toxins Prepared through Coassembly of Macrocyclic Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular detoxification is an emerging strategy for treating poisoning; however, developing supramolecular therapeutic materials as an antidote to macromolecular toxins is challenging. To overcome this challenge, a heteromultivalent coassembling material (CCA&#8208;CD) comprising macrocyclic amphiphiles is developed. The CCA&#8208;CD binds with melittin strongly and selectively, and significantly alleviates its toxicity, serving as a novel supramolecular antidote used for melittin poisoning treatment.








Abstract
Poisoning is a leading cause of admission to medical emergency departments and intensive care units. Supramolecular detoxification, which involves injecting supramolecular receptors that bind with toxins to suppress their biological activity, is an emerging strategy for poisoning treatment; it has few requirements and a broad application scope. However, it is still a formidable challenge to design supramolecular therapeutic materials as an antidote to macromolecular toxins, because the large size, flexible conformation, and presence of multiple and diverse binding sites of biomacromolecules hinder their recognition. Herein, a supramolecular antidote to macromolecular toxins is developed through the coassembly of macrocyclic amphiphiles, relying on heteromultivalent recognition between the coassembled components and toxic macromolecules. The coassembly of amphiphilic cyclodextrin and calixarene strongly and selectively captures melittin, a toxin studied herein; this imparts various therapeutic effects such as inhibiting the interactions of melittin with cell membranes, alleviating melittin cytotoxicity and hemolytic toxicity, reducing the mortality rate of melittin&#8208;poisoned mice, and mitigating damage to major organs. The use of the proposed antidote overcomes the limitation of supramolecular detoxification applicability to only small&#8208;molecular toxins. The antidote can also detoxify other macromolecular toxins as long as selective and strong binding is achieved because of the coassembling tunability.

         <title>3D Temporary&#8208;Magnetized Soft Robotic Structures for Enhanced Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a mechanically guided, compressive&#8208;buckling process, a set of judiciously engineered 3D soft robotic structures can be developed based on magnetic materials. Under the precise control of the external magnetic&#8208;field, the temporary&#8208;magnetized 3D structures can achieve various tethered locomotion. Further integration with functional devices (piezoelectric energy harvester, solar cell) allows for enhanced energy harvesting, and potentially multimodal sensing and robotic interfaces.








Abstract
The advent of functional materials offers tremendous potential in a broad variety of areas such as electronics, robotics, and energy devices. Magnetic materials are an attractive candidate that enable multifunctional devices with capabilities in both sensing and actuation. However, current magnetic devices, especially those with complex motion modalities, rely on permanently magnetized materials with complicated, non&#8208;uniform magnetization profiles. Here, based on magnetic materials with temporary&#8208;magnetization, a mechanically guided assembly process successfully converts laser&#8208;patterned 2D magnetic materials into judiciously engineered 3D structures, with dimensions and geometries ranging from mesoscale 3D filaments, to arrayed centimeter&#8208;scale 3D membranes. With tailorable mechanical properties and highly adjustable geometries, 3D soft structures can exhibit various tethered locomotions under the precise control of magnetic fields, including local deformation, unidirectional tilting, and omnidirectional rotation, and can serve as dynamic surfaces for further integration with other functional materials or devices. Examples demonstrated here focus on energy&#8208;harvesting systems, including 3D piezoelectric devices for noncontact conversion of mechanical energy and active motion sensing, as well as 3D solar tracking systems. The design strategy and resulting magnetic&#8208;controlled 3D soft structures hold great promise not only for enhanced energy harvesting, but also for multimodal sensing, robotic interfaces, and biomedical devices.

         <title>Sweet Electronics: Honey&#8208;Gated Complementary Organic Transistors and Circuits Operating in Air</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of edible electronics devices requires unconventional solutions, in particular, the use of functional food&#8208;based materials in the design. An inherently safe and nutritive compound, honey, is hereby proposed as an effective gating medium for the realization of air&#8208;stable complementary organic transistors and circuits operating at low voltage (&lt;1&#160;V) and featuring other distinctive electronic functionalities.








Abstract
Sustainable harnessing of natural resources is key moving toward a new&#8208;generation electronics, which features a unique combination of electronic functionality, low cost, and absence of environmental and health hazards. Within this framework, edible electronics, of which transistors and circuits are a fundamental component, is an emerging field, exploiting edible materials that can be safely ingested, and subsequently digested after performing their function. Dielectrics are a critical functional element of transistors, often constituting their major volume. Yet, to date, there are only scarce examples of electrolytic food&#8208;based materials able to provide low&#8208;voltage operation of transistors at ambient conditions. In this context, a cost&#8208;effective and edible substance, honey, is proposed to be used as an electrolytic gate viscous dielectric in electrolyte&#8208;gated organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). Both n&#8208; and p&#8208;type honey&#8208;gated OFETs (HGOFETs) are demonstrated, with distinctive features such as low voltage (&lt;1 V)&#160;operation, long&#8208;term shelf life and operation stability in air, and compatibility with large&#8208;area fabrication processes, such as inkjet printing on edible tattoo&#8208;paper. Such complementary devices enable robust honey&#8208;based integrated logic circuits, here exemplified by inverting logic gates and ring oscillators. A marked device responsivity to humidity provides promising opportunities for sensing applications, specifically, for moisture control of dried or dehydrated food.

         <title>Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of Organic Core/Multi&#8208;Shell Microwires for Trichromatic White&#8208;Light Sources</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>

Through regulating the noncovalent interactions between organic semiconductor molecules (|ECT, DgpC&#8208;TCNB = &#8722;18.35&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1|&#160;&gt;&#160;|ECT, DgpC&#8208;TFP = &#8722;13.45&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1|&#160;&gt;&#160;|E&#960;&#8211;&#960;, DgpC = &#8722;6.81&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1|), a hierarchical self&#8208;assembly approach of horizontal epitaxial&#8208;growth is demonstrated for the precise synthesis of organic core/double&#8208;shell microwires with radial red&#8211;green&#8211;blue (RGB) substructures for miniaturized white&#8208;light sources (CIE [0.34, 0.36]).








Abstract
White&#8208;light&#8208;emissive organic micro/nanostructures hold exotic potential applications in full&#8208;color displays, on&#8208;chip wavelength&#8208;division multiplexing, and backlights of portable display devices, but are rarely realized in organic core/shell heterostructures. Herein, through regulating the noncovalent interactions between organic semiconductor molecules, a hierarchical self&#8208;assembly approach of horizontal epitaxial&#8208;growth is demonstrated for the fine synthesis of organic core/mono&#8208;shell microwires with multicolor emission (red&#8211;green, red&#8211;blue, and green&#8211;blue) and especially organic core/double&#8208;shell microwires with radial red&#8211;green&#8211;blue (RGB) emission, whose components are dibenzo[g,p]chrysene (DgpC)&#8208;based charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complexes. In fact, the desired lattice mismatching (&#8776;2%) and the excellent structure compatibility of these CT complexes facilitate the epitaxial&#8208;growth process for the facile synthesis of organic core/shell microwires. With the RGB&#8208;emissive substructures, these core/double&#8208;shell organic microwires are microscale white&#8208;light sources (CIE [0.34, 0.36]). Besides, the white&#8208;emissive core/double&#8208;shell microwires demonstrate the fascinating full&#8208;spectrum light transportation from 400 to 700&#160;nm.

&lt;p&gt;Through regulating the noncovalent interactions between organic semiconductor molecules (|&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;CT, DgpC-TCNB = &#8722;18.35&#160;kcal mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;|&#160;&amp;gt;&#160;|&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;CT, DgpC-TFP = &#8722;13.45&#160;kcal mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;|&#160;&amp;gt;&#160;|&lt;i&gt;E&#960;&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;&#960;, DgpC = &#8722;6.81&#160;kcal mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;|), a hierarchical self-assembly approach of horizontal epitaxial-growth is demonstrated for the precise synthesis of organic core/double-shell microwires with radial red&#8211;green&#8211;blue (RGB) substructures for miniaturized white-light sources (CIE [0.34, 0.36]).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White-light-emissive organic micro/nanostructures hold exotic potential applications in full-color displays, on-chip wavelength-division multiplexing, and backlights of portable display devices, but are rarely realized in organic core/shell heterostructures. Herein, through regulating the noncovalent interactions between organic semiconductor molecules, a hierarchical self-assembly approach of horizontal epitaxial-growth is demonstrated for the fine synthesis of organic core/mono-shell microwires with multicolor emission (red&#8211;green, red&#8211;blue, and green&#8211;blue) and especially organic core/double-shell microwires with radial red&#8211;green&#8211;blue (RGB) emission, whose components are dibenzo[g,p]chrysene (DgpC)-based charge-transfer (CT) complexes. In fact, the desired lattice mismatching (&#8776;2%) and the excellent structure compatibility of these CT complexes facilitate the epitaxial-growth process for the facile synthesis of organic core/shell microwires. With the RGB-emissive substructures, these core/double-shell organic microwires are microscale white-light sources (CIE [0.34, 0.36]). Besides, the white-emissive core/double-shell microwires demonstrate the fascinating full-spectrum light transportation from 400 to 700&#160;nm. This work indeed opens up a novel avenue for the accurate construction of organic core/shell heterostructures, which provides an attractive platform for the organic integrated optoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Time&#8211;Temperature Integrating Optical Sensors Based on Gradient Colloidal Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A colloidal stopband&#8208;based time&#8211;temperature integrator is introduced, which can monitor the thermal history of a specific system over an adjustable time and temperature range. The fabrication of a binary colloidal crystal gradient comprising same&#8208;sized, monodisperse particles with distinct glass transition temperatures are the key components for this type of integrating sensor.








Abstract
Manipulation&#8208;free and autonomous recording of temperature states for extended periods of time is of increasing importance for food spoilage and battery safety assessment. An optical readout is preferred for low&#8208;tech visual inspection. Here, a concept for time&#8211;temperature integrators based on colloidal crystals is introduced. Two unique features in this class of advanced materials are combined: 1) the film&#8208;formation kinetics can be controlled by orders of magnitude based on mixtures of particles with distinct glass transition temperatures. 2) A gradual variation of the particle mixture along a linear gradient of the colloidal crystal enables local readout. Tailor&#8208;made latex particles of identical size but different glass transition temperatures provide a homogenous photonic stopband. The disappearance of this opalescence is directly related to the local particle ratio and the exposure to a time and temperature combination. This sensing material can be adjusted to report extended intermediate and short excessive temperature events, which makes it specifically suitable for long&#8208;term tracing and threshold applications.

         <title>3D Printing of Elastomeric Bioinspired Complex Adhesive Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D&#8208;printing&#8208;based fabrication approach is utilized for creating complex elastomeric microstructural adhesives directly. Two hybrid bioinspired structure designs are demonstrated, combining the strengths of gecko&#8208;inspired microfiber adhesives with springtail&#8208; and octopus&#8208;inspired microstructures to enable complex adhesives toward various real&#8208;world applications.








Abstract
Bioinspired elastomeric structural adhesives can provide reversible and controllable adhesion on dry/wet and synthetic/biological surfaces for a broad range of commercial applications. Shape complexity and performance of the existing structural adhesives are limited by the used specific fabrication technique, such as molding. To overcome these limitations by proposing complex 3D microstructured adhesive designs, a 3D elastomeric microstructure fabrication approach is implemented using two&#8208;photon&#8208;polymerization&#8208;based 3D printing. A custom aliphatic urethane&#8208;acrylate&#8208;based elastomer is used as the 3D printing material. Two designs are demonstrated with two combined biological inspirations to show the advanced capabilities enabled by the proposed fabrication approach and custom elastomer. The first design focuses on springtail&#8208; and gecko&#8208;inspired hybrid microfiber adhesive, which has the multifunctionalities of side&#8208;surface liquid super&#8208;repellency, top&#8208;surface liquid super&#8208;repellency, and strong reversible adhesion features in a single fiber array. The second design primarily centers on octopus&#8208; and gecko&#8208;inspired hybrid adhesive, which exhibits the benefits of both octopus&#8208; and gecko&#8208;inspired microstructured adhesives for strong reversible adhesion on both wet and dry surfaces, such as skin. This fabrication approach could be used to produce many other 3D complex elastomeric structural adhesives for future real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Crosslinked Dynamic Hydrogel Incorporating {Mo154} with pH and NIR Responsiveness for Chemo&#8208;Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual pH&#8208; and near infra&#8208;red (NIR)&#8208;responsive hydrogel is developed composed of benzylaldehyde functionalized poly(ethylene glycol), poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) functionalized chitosan, and a polyoxometalate {Mo154}. Crosslinked by Schiff base and electrostatic interactions, the hydrogel has dynamic networks, injectability, and fast self&#8208;healing properties. Combining doxorubicin and NIR laser irradiation, the hydrogel shows thermal ablation of cancer cells and simultaneous release of drugs for chemo&#8208;photothermal therapy.








Abstract
Polyoxometalates are an emerging class of molecular clusters, with well&#8208;defined structures and chemical compositions that are produced through simple, low&#8208;cost, and highly reproducible methods. In particular, the wheel&#8208;shaped cluster {Mo154} is a promising photothermal agent due to its intervalence charge transfer transitions. However, its toxicity hinders its systemic administration, being the development of a localized delivery system still incipient. Herein, an injectable and self&#8208;healing hydrogel of easy preparation and administration is developed, incorporating both {Mo154} and doxorubicin for synergistic photothermal and chemotherapy applications. The hydrogel is composed of benzylaldehyde functionalized polyethylene glycol, poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) functionalized chitosan and {Mo154}. The gelation occurs within 60&#160;s at room temperature, and the dual crosslinking by Schiff base and electrostatic interactions generates a dynamic network, which enables self&#8208;healing after injection. Moreover, the hydrogel delivers chemotherapeutic drugs, with a release triggered by dual near infra&#8208;red (NIR) radiation and pH changes. This stimuli&#8208;responsive release system along with the photothermal conversion ability of the hydrogel allows the simultaneous combination of photothermal and chemotherapy. This synergic system efficiently ablates the cancer tumor in vivo with no systemic toxicity. Overall, this work paves the way for the development of novel {Mo154}&#8208;based systems, incorporated in self&#8208;healing and injectable hydrogels for dual chemo&#8208;photothermal therapy.

         <title>Antibacterial Gel Coatings Inspired by the Cryptic Function of a Mussel Byssal Peptide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In addition to its role in wet adhesion, it is discovered that a peptide (Mfp&#8208;529&#8208;47) derived from the foot pad of mussels exhibits cryptic antibacterial activity. This discovery inspires the design of antibacterial adhesive hydrogels that kill bacteria by two mechanisms: surface&#8208;contact membrane disruption and oxidative killing. The lead material, MIKA2, inhibits bacterial colonization on titanium implants in mice.








Abstract
Although the adhesive and cohesive nature of mussel byssal proteins have long served to inspire the design of materials embodying these properties, their characteristic amino acid compositions suggest that they might also serve to inspire an unrelated material function not yet associated with this class of protein. Herein, it is demonstrated that a peptide derived from mussel foot protein&#8208;5, a key protein in mussel adhesion, displays antibacterial properties, a yet unreported activity. This cryptic function serves as inspiration for the design of a new class of peptide&#8208;based antibacterial adhesive hydrogels prepared via self&#8208;assembly, which are active against drug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. The gels exert two mechanisms of action, surface&#8208;contact membrane disruption and oxidative killing affected by material&#8208;produced H2O2. Detailed studies relating amino acid composition and sequence to material mechanical adhesion/cohesion and antibacterial activity affords the MIKA2 adhesive gel, a material with a superior activity that is shown to inhibit colonization of titanium implants in mice.

         <title>Monte Carlo Simulations Reveal New Design Principles for Efficient Nanoradiosensitizers Based on Nanoscale Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation study reveals nanoscale metal&#8211;organic frameworks (nMOFs) as superior radiosensitizers over non&#8208;porous nanoparticles. The porous lattice model shows improved radiosensitization regardless of radiation source and lattice size. An optimal dose enhancement can be achieved by tuning the geometry of the lattice, providing the theoretical basis for the design of nMOFs for radiotherapy.








Abstract
Nanoscale metal&#8211;organic frameworks (nMOFs) have recently been shown to provide better radiosensitization than solid nanoparticles (NPs) when excited with X&#8208;rays. Here, a Monte Carlo simulation of different radiosensitization effects by NPs and nMOFs using a lattice model consisting of 3D arrays of nanoscale secondary building units (SBUs) is reported. The simulation results reveal that lattices outperform solid NPs regardless of radiation sources or particle sizes via enhanced scatterings of photons and electrons within the lattices. Optimum dose enhancement can be achieved by tuning SBU size and inter&#8208;SBU distance.

         <title>Cactus&#8208;Spine&#8208;Inspired Sweat&#8208;Collecting Patch for Fast and Continuous Monitoring of Sweat</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sweat&#8208;collecting patch with high sweat&#8208;collection efficiency is developed. The patch uses cactus&#8208;spine&#8208;inspired wedge&#8208;shaped wettability&#8208;patterned channels, which induce a unidirectional Laplace pressure that transports the sweat to the sensing&#8208;area spontaneously without leaving it inside the channel. A sensor based on the patch responds quickly to biochemicals in sweat and the patch enables the continuous monitoring of biochemical changes in sweat.








Abstract
A sweat sensor is expected to be the most appropriate wearable device for noninvasive healthcare monitoring. However, the practical use of sweat sensors is impeded by irregular and low sweat secretion rates. Here, a sweat&#8208;collecting patch that can collect sweat efficiently for fast and continuous healthcare monitoring is demonstrated. The patch uses cactus&#8208;spine&#8208;inspired wedge&#8208;shaped wettability&#8208;patterned channels on a hierarchical microstructured/nanostructured surface. The channel shape, in combination with the superhydrophobic/superhydrophilic surface materials, induces a unidirectional Laplace pressure that transports the sweat to the sensing area spontaneously even when the patch is aligned vertically. The patch demonstrates superior sweat&#8208;collecting efficiency and reduces the time required to fill the sensing area by transporting sweat almost without leaving it inside the channel. Therefore, a sensor based on the patch responds quickly to biochemicals in sweat, and the patch enables the continuous monitoring of changes in sweat biochemicals according to their changes in the wearer's blood.

         <title>Engineered Extracellular Matrices with Integrated Wireless Microactuators to Study Mechanobiology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in vitro biomimetic platform that provides independent control over geometry, mechanics, and structure over extracellular matrices is introduced. Remote application of forces using robotically controlled magnetic microactuators triggers native mechanobiology responses including intracellular signaling and directed migration. A digital twin complements the platform by reporting stresses generated upon actuation.








Abstract
Mechanobiology explores how forces regulate cell behaviors and what molecular machinery are responsible for the sensing, transduction, and modulation of mechanical cues. To this end, probing of cells cultured on planar substrates has served as a primary experimental setting for many decades. However, native extracellular matrices (ECMs) consist of fibrous protein assemblies where the physical properties spanning from the individual fiber to the network architecture can influence the transmission of forces to and from the cells. Here, a robotic manipulation platform that allows wireless, localized, and programmable deformation of an engineered fibrous ECM is introduced. A finite&#8208;element&#8208;based digital twin of the fiber network calibrated against measured local and global parameters enables the calculation of deformations and stresses generated by different magnetic actuation schemes across a range of network properties. Physiologically relevant mechanical forces are applied to cells cultured on the fiber network, statically or dynamically, revealing insights into the effects of matrix&#8208;borne forces and deformations as well as force&#8208;mediated matrix remodeling on cell migration and intracellular signaling. These capabilities are not matched by any existing approach, and this versatile platform has the potential to uncover fundamental mechanisms of mechanobiology in settings with greater relevance to living tissues.

         <title>Promoting Energy Transfer via Manipulation of Crystallization Kinetics of Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskites for Efficient Green Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homogeneous distribution of different&#8208;n phases and more efficient energy transfer is realized in quasi&#8208;2D perovskites. The origin is found to be the manipulation of the crystallization kinetics, where the addition of potassium restricts the nucleation of high&#8208;n phases and allows the growth of low&#8208;n phases, resulting in an external quantum efficiency of 18.15%.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D (Q&#8208;2D) perovskites are promising materials applied in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) due to their high exciton binding energy and quantum confinement effects. However, Q&#8208;2D perovskites feature a multiphase structure with abundant grain boundaries and interfaces, leading to nonradiative loss during the energy&#8208;transfer process. Here, a more efficient energy transfer in Q&#8208;2D perovskites is achieved by manipulating the crystallization kinetics of different&#8208;n phases. A series of alkali&#8208;metal bromides is utilized to manipulate the nucleation and growth of Q&#8208;2D perovskites, which is likely associated with the Coulomb interaction between alkali&#8208;metal ions and the negatively charged PbBr64&#8211; frames. The incorporation of K+ is found to restrict the nucleation of high&#8208;n phases and allows the subsequent growth of low&#8208;n phases, contributing to a spatially more homogeneous distribution of different&#8208;n phases and promoted energy transfer. As a result, highly efficient green Q&#8208;2D perovskites LEDs with a champion EQE of 18.15% and a maximum brightness of 25 800&#160;cd m&#8211;2 are achieved. The findings affirm a novel method to optimize the performance of Q&#8208;2D perovskite LEDs.

         <title>An Optogenetics&#8208;Inspired Flexible van der Waals Optoelectronic Synapse and its Application to a Convolutional Neural Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible van der Waals (vdW) optoelectronic synapse fabricated on 2D vdW layered rhenium disulfide, which features an inherent photosensitive memory nature derived from the persistent photoconductivity effect, is proposed. Following in&#8208;depth analysis including density functional theory calculations on rhenium disulfide, its feasibility for hardware neural networks with learning ability is demonstrated using a convolutional neural network composed of vdW optoelectronic synapses.








Abstract
Optogenetics refers to a technique that uses light to modulate neuronal activity with a high spatiotemporal resolution, which enables the manipulation of learning and memory functions in the human brain. This strategy of controlling neuronal activity using light can be applied for the development of intelligent systems, including neuromorphic and in&#8208;memory computing systems. Herein, a flexible van der Waals (vdW) optoelectronic synapse is reported, which is a core component of optogenetics&#8208;inspired intelligent systems. This synapse is fabricated on 2D vdW layered rhenium disulfide (ReS2) that features an inherent photosensitive memory nature derived from the persistent photoconductivity (PPC) effect, successfully mimicking the dynamics of biological synapses. Based on first&#8208;principles calculations, the PPC effect is identified to originate from sulfur vacancies in ReS2 that have an inherent tendency to form shallow defect states near the conduction band edges and under optical excitation lead to large lattice relaxation. Finally, the feasibility of applying the synapses in optogenetics&#8208;inspired intelligent systems is demonstrated via training and inference tasks for the CIFAR&#8208;10 dataset using a convolutional neural network composed of vdW optoelectronic synapse devices.

This strategy of controlling neuronal activity using light can be applied for the development of intelligent systems, including neuromorphic and in-memory computing systems. Herein, a flexible van der Waals (vdW) optoelectronic synapse is reported, which is a core component of optogenetics-inspired intelligent systems. This synapse is fabricated on 2D vdW layered rhenium disulfide (ReS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) that features an inherent photosensitive memory nature derived from the persistent photoconductivity (PPC) effect, successfully mimicking the dynamics of biological synapses. Based on first-principles calculations, the PPC effect is identified to originate from sulfur vacancies in ReS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that have an inherent tendency to form shallow defect states near the conduction band edges and under optical excitation lead to large lattice relaxation. Finally, the feasibility of applying the synapses in optogenetics-inspired intelligent systems is demonstrated via training and inference tasks for the CIFAR-10 dataset using a convolutional neural network composed of vdW optoelectronic synapse devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spontaneous Topological Magnetic Transitions in NdCo5 Rare&#8208;Earth Magnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spontaneous magnetic biskyrmion lattices and the successive transformation into enclosed in&#8208;plane domains over a broad temperature range of 120&#8211;282 K is directly observed by in situ cooling a hexagonal rare&#8208;earth NdCo5 alloy in Lorentz TEM. The ability to manipulate topological magnetization by anisotropy invites application exploration of novel topological magnetic spin textures and physical mechanisms in rare&#8208;earth magnets.








Abstract
Particle&#8208;like magnetic textures with nanometric sizes, such as skyrmions, are potentially suitable for designing high&#8208;efficiency information bits in future spintronics devices. In general, the Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interactions and dipolar interactions are the dominant factors for generating nonlinear spin configurations. However, to stabilize the topological skyrmions, an external magnetic field is usually required. In this study, the spontaneous emergence of skyrmions is directly observed, together with the unique successive topological domain evolution during the spin reorientation transition in a neodymium&#8211;cobalt (NdCo5) rare&#8208;earth magnet. On decreasing the temperature, nanometric skyrmion lattices evolve into enclosed in&#8208;plane domains (EIPDs) similar to mini bar&#8208;magnets with size below 120&#160;nm. The internal magnetization rotates with magnetic anisotropy, demonstrating the ability to manipulate the mini bar&#8208;magnets. The nanoscale EIPD lattices remain robust over the wide temperature range of 241&#8211;167 K, indicating the possibility of high&#8208;density in&#8208;plane magnetic information storage. The generation of spontaneous magnetic skyrmions and the successive domain transformation in the traditional NdCo5 rare&#8208;earth magnet may prompt application exploration for topological magnetic spin textures with novel physical mechanisms in versatile magnets.

         <title>Self&#8208;Induced Type&#8208;I Band Alignment at Surface Grain Boundaries for Highly Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultralow surface temperature on perovskite films is constructed, then surface perovskite lattice is etched by the condensed moisture. Therefore, PbI2 is produced and type&#8208;I band alignment at the upper surface grain boundaries is formed, which significantly reduces the interface loss of carriers and improves the efficiency of perovskite solar cells to 23.2%.








Abstract
The open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is reported to be significantly weakened by carrier loss at the film surface. Here, the moisture condensation at only the upper surface of perovskite films is controlled by constructing an ultralow surface temperature. Then, type&#8208;I band alignment can be formed at the surface grain boundaries due to the etching effect of trace amounts of condensed moisture. The beneficially constructed surface type&#8208;I band alignment can effectively repel carriers and return them to the inside of the grain, significantly avoiding the carrier loss at films surface. As a result, a superior carrier lifetime exceeding 2.5&#160;&#181;s is obtained and the VOC of PSC is remarkably boosted from 1.07 to 1.17&#160;V. The minimum VOC deficit of only 0.39&#160;V enables a substantial gain in power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 20.2% to 22.4% in one&#8208;step spin&#8208;coating methods. Moreover, this innovation is versatile and a champion PCE of 23.2% is also achieved in two&#8208;step spin&#8208;coating methods.

         <title>Reversible Dendritic&#8208;Crystal&#8208;Reinforced Polymer Gel for Bioinspired Adaptable Adhesive</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystal&#8208;fiber&#8208;reinforced polymer gel adhesive is prepared by introducing room&#8208;temperature crystallizable solvent into the polymer network, realizing ultrastrong adhesion strength and universal interface adaptability. The adhesive ensures the high adhesion strength to the hard interface and excellent peeling toughness to soft biological tissues and can be adjusted via external stimuli, which achieves superior detachability and recycling performance.








Abstract
High&#8208;strength and reversible adhesion technology, which is a universal phenomenon in nature but remains challenging for artificial synthesis, is essential for the development of modern science. Existing adhesive designs without interface versatility hinder their application to arbitrary surfaces. Bioinspired by creeper suckers, a crystal&#8208;fiber reinforced polymer gel adhesive with ultrastrong adhesion strength and universal interface adaptability is creatively prepared via introducing a room&#8208;temperature crystallizable solvent into the polymer network. The gel adhesive formed by hydrogen bonding interaction between crystal fibers and polymer network can successfully realize over 9.82&#160;MPa reversible adhesion strength for rough interface and 406.87 J m&#8722;2 peeling toughness for skin tissue. In situ anchoring is achieved for adapting to different geometrical surfaces. The adhesion performance can be significantly improved with the further increase of the interfacial roughness and hydrophilicity, whose dissipation mechanism is simulated by finite element analysis. The melting&#8211;crystallization equilibrium of the crystal fibers is proved by synchrotron radiation scattering. Accordingly, reversible phase&#8208;transition triggered by light and heat can realize the controlled adhere&#8211;detach recycle. Later adjustments to the monomers or crystals are expected to broaden its applications to various fields such as bioelectronics, electronic processing, and machine handling.

         <title>A Micrometer&#8208;Sized Silicon/Carbon Composite Anode Synthesized by Impregnation of Petroleum Pitch in Nanoporous Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A micrometer&#8208;sized silicon/carbon composite anode developed by facile and scalable impregnation of petroleum pitch that stabilizes nanoporous Si against sintering at high temperature is reported. The composite anode including single nanometer&#8208;sized primary particles shielded by pitch&#8208;derived carbon exhibits outstanding battery performance such as 80% capacity retention after 450 cycles in the full cell system.








Abstract
Porous silicon (Si)/carbon nanocomposites have been extensively explored as a promising anode material for high&#8208;energy lithium (Li)&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, shrinking of the pores and sintering of Si in the nanoporous structure during fabrication often diminishes the full benefits of nanoporous Si. Herein, a scalable method is reported to preserve the porous Si nanostructure by impregnating petroleum pitch inside of porous Si before high&#8208;temperature treatment. The resulting micrometer&#8208;sized Si/C composite maintains a desired porosity to accommodate large volume change and high conductivity to facilitate charge transfer. It also forms a stable surface coating that limits the penetration of electrolyte into nanoporous Si and minimizes the side reaction between electrolyte and Si during cycling and storage. A Si&#8208;based anode with 80% of pitch&#8208;derived carbon/nanoporous Si enables very stable cycling of a Si||Li(Ni0.5Co0.2Mn0.3)O2 (NMC532) battery (80% capacity retention after 450 cycles). It also leads to low swelling in both particle and electrode levels required for the next generation of high&#8208;energy LIBs. The process also can be used to preserve the porous structure of other nanoporous materials that need to be treated at high temperatures.

         <title>Lithiation&#8208;Enabled High&#8208;Density Nitrogen Vacancies Electrocatalyze CO2 to C2 Products</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical CO2 reduction to produce C2 products is attractive but is still challenged by low activity and poor selectivity. A Cu3Nx catalyst with abundant nitrogen vacancies induced by lithiation/delithiation presents a much&#8208;improved Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;82% for C2 products due to the lower energy barriers of the key C2 pathway intermediates.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction to produce valuable C2 products is attractive but still suffers with relatively poor selectivity and stability at high current densities, mainly due to the low efficiency in the coupling of two *CO intermediates. Herein, it is demonstrated that high&#8208;density nitrogen vacancies formed on cubic copper nitrite (Cu3Nx) feature as efficient electrocatalytic centers for CO&#8211;CO coupling to form the key OCCO* intermediate toward C2 products. Cu3Nx with different nitrogen densities are fabricated by an electrochemical lithium tuning strategy, and density functional theory calculations indicate that the adsorption energies of CO* and the energy barriers of forming key C2 intermediates are strongly correlated with nitrogen vacancy density. The Cu3Nx catalyst with abundant nitrogen vacancies presents one of the highest Faradaic efficiencies toward C2 products of 81.7&#160;&#177; 2.3% at &#8722;1.15&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (without ohmic correction), corresponding to the partial current density for C2 production as &#8722;307&#160;&#177; 9 mA cm&#8722;2. An outstanding electrochemical stability is also demonstrated at high current densities, substantially exceeding CuOx catalysts with oxygen vacancies. The work suggests an attractive approach to create stable anion vacancies as catalytic centers toward multicarbon products in electrochemical CO2 reduction.

         <title>Truth and Myth of Phase Coexistence in Methylammonium Lead Iodide Perovskite Thin Film via Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>

Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites have attracted substantial interest as the most favorable prospective material for efficient photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices. However, their extreme sensitivity to electron beam radiation makes it difficult to obtain their intrinsic structure by transmission electron microscopy and can even lead to significant misidentifications. In 2018, the coexistence of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) in the cubic and tetragonal phase using electron microscopy and electron diffraction techniques was reported in article &#8220;Self&#8208;Organized Superlattice and Phase Coexistence inside Thin Film Organometal Halide Perovskite&#8221;. Herein, however, that claim is challenged by comparing their experimental data to simulated diffraction patterns and arguing that their perovskite samples may have been damaged due to excessive electron beam irradiation. Consequently, true phase coexistence was not observed in that previously reported work, rather merely the decomposition products of MAPbI3.

Abstract
In response to the Comment on article &#8220;Self&#8208;Organized Superlattice and Phase Coexistence inside Thin Film Organometal Halide Perovskite&#8221;, it is suggested that the facts that the existence of hexagonal PbI2 is discrepant in 3D crystallographic interpretation and that observation of (01&#175;0) and (100) reflections occurs in general, together make the challenges that were raised in the published Comment less convincing. In addition, a new transmission electron microscopy method using direction&#8208;selective electron beam damage of the organometal halide perovskite is disclosed.

Photothermal Materials
In article number 2007761, Shiqi Wang, H&#233;lder Santos, and co&#8208;workers introduce a polyoxometalate {Mo154}&#8208;incorporating, dual&#8208;crosslinked dynamic hydrogel (Mo154Gel) formed by Schiff base and electrostatic interactions. Mo154Gel shows exceptional photothermal conversion, and pH&#8208; and near&#8208;infrared&#8208;laser&#8208;triggered drug release. This work paves the way for the development of novel {Mo154}&#8208;based platforms incorporated in self&#8208;healing and injectable hydrogels for combinatorial chemo&#8208;photothermal cancer therapy.

Cancer Therapy
A two&#8208;edged&#8208;sword strategy for anticancer and chondroprotective treatment is approached by combining two key players, as reported by Mi&#8208;Lan Kang, Hak&#8208;Joon Sung, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2101558. Cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;derived nanoparticles (CMNPs) induce hypoxic cell&#8211;cell packing seen commonly in cancer growth and chondrogenesis.

&lt;p&gt;A two-edged-sword strategy for anticancer and chondroprotective treatment is approached by combining two key players, as reported by Mi-Lan Kang, Hak-Joon Sung, and co-workers in article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202101558"&gt;2101558&lt;/a&gt;. Cell-membrane-derived nanoparticles (CMNPs) induce hypoxic cell&#8211;cell packing seen commonly in cancer growth and chondrogenesis. Notch-1 suppressor display on CMNPs inhibits angiogenesis efficiently, thereby promoting anticancer growth and prochondrogenesis simultaneously. This study suggests an unprecedented therapeutic strategy for laryngeal cancer which damages cartilage progressively.

Optoelectronic Synapses
In article number 2102980, a flexible optoelectronic synapse fabricated on 2D van der Waals (vdW) layered rhenium disulfide, which features an inherent photosensitive memory nature derived from the persistent photoconductivity effect, is presented by Yong&#8208;Hoon Kim, Jin&#8208;Hong Park, and co&#8208;workers. After in&#8208;depth analysis including density functional theory calculations on rhenium disulfide, its feasibility for a hardware neural network with learning ability is also demonstrated using a convolutional neural network composed of vdW optoelectronic synapses.

Noninvasive Healthcare Monitoring
In article number 2102740, Kilwon Cho and co&#8208;workers report a sweat&#8208;collecting patch with directional sweat transportation, enabling fast and continuous monitoring of sweat by a sensor. The wedge&#8208;shaped wettability patterns of the patch are inspired by spines of cacti; the channel shape, in combination with the superhydrophobic/superhydrophilic surface materials, induces a unidirectional Laplace pressure that transports the sweat to the sensing&#8208;area fast and spontaneously.

         <title>Digital Light Processing&#8208;based Bioprinting with Composable Gradients</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recapitulation of complex tissues signifies a remarkable challenge and, to date, only few approaches have emerged that can efficiently reconstruct necessary gradients in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) constructs. This is true even though mimicry of these gradients is of great importance to establish the functionality of engineered tissues and devices. Here, a composable&#8208;gradient digital light processing (DLP)&#8208;based (bio)printing system is developed for the first time, utilizing the unprecedented integration of a microfluidic mixer for the generation of either continual or discrete gradients of desired (bio)inks in real time. Notably, the precisely controlled gradients are composable on&#8208;the&#8208;fly by facilely adjusting the (bio)ink flow ratios. In addition, this setup is designed in such a way that no washing steps are needed when exchanging the gradient (bio)inks, further enhancing our time&#8208; and (bio)ink&#8208;saving strategy. Various planar and 3D structures exhibiting continual gradients of materials, of cell densities, of growth factor concentrations, of hydrogel stiffness, and of porosities in horizontal and/or vertical direction, are exemplified. The composable fabrication of multifunctional gradients strongly support the potential of our unique bioprinting system in numerous biomedical applications.

Entering largely uncharted territory, time&#8208;resolved pump&#8208;probe Kerr rotation is used to explore the coherent spin dynamics of electrons and holes in bulk FA0.9Cs0.1PbI2.8Br0.2 and to determine key parameters characterizing their spins interactions, such as the g&#8208;factors and relaxation times. The demonstrated long spin dynamics and narrow g&#8208;factor distribution prove the perovskites as promising competitors for conventional semiconductors in spintronics. The dynamic nuclear polarization via spin&#8208;oriented holes is realized and the identification of the 207Pb isotope in optically&#8208;detected nuclear magnetic resonance proves that the hole&#8208;nuclei interaction is dominated by the lead ions. A detailed theoretical analysis accounting for the specifics of the lead halide perovskite materials allows the evaluation of the underlying hyperfine interaction constants, both for electrons and holes. Recombination and spin dynamics evidence that at low temperatures photogenerated electrons and holes are localized at different regions of the perovskite crystal, resulting in their long lifetimes up to 44&#160;&#956;s. Our&#160;findings form the base for the tailored development of spin&#8208;optoelectronic applications for the large family of lead halide perovskites and their&#160;nanostructures.

         <title>Training the Polarization in Integrated La0.15Bi0.85FeO3&#8208;Based Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
The functionalities of BiFeO3&#8208;based magnetoelectric multiferroic heterostructures rely on the controlled manipulation of its ferroelectric domains and of the corresponding net in&#8208;plane polarization, as this aspect guides the voltage&#8208;controlled magnetic switching. Chemical substitution has emerged as a key to push the energy dissipation of the BiFeO3 into the attojoule range but appears to result in a disordered domain configuration. Using non&#8208;invasive optical second&#8208;harmonic generation on heavily La&#8208;substituted BiFeO3 films, we show that a weak net in&#8208;plane polarization remains imprinted in the pristine films despite the apparent domain disorder. We find that this ingrained net in&#8208;plane polarization can be trained with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane electric fields compatible with applications. Operando studies on capacitor heterostructures treated in this way show the full restoration of the domain configuration of pristine BiFeO3 along with a giant net in&#8208;plane polarization enhancement. Thus, our experiments reveal a surprising robustness of the net in&#8208;plane polarization of BiFeO3 against chemical modification, an important criterion in ongoing attempts to integrate magnetoelectric materials into energy&#8208;efficient devices.

         <title>Ten Years of Progress in the Synthesis and Development of MXenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) are among the largest 2D material families. MXenes&#8217; unique properties, such as their metal&#8208;like electrical conductivity, render them quite useful in a large number of applications including energy storage, optoelectronic, biomedical, communications, and environmental. A brief historical overview of the first 10 years of MXene research and a perspective on their synthesis and future development are provided.








Abstract
Since their discovery in 2011, the number of 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) has steadily increased. Currently more than 40 MXene compositions exist. The ultimate number is far greater and in time they may develop into the largest family of 2D materials known. MXenes&#8217; unique properties, such as their metal&#8208;like electrical conductivity reaching &#8776;20&#160;000 S cm&#8722;1, render them quite useful in a large number of applications, including energy storage, optoelectronic, biomedical, communications, and environmental. The number of MXene papers and patents published has been growing quickly. The first MXene generation is synthesized using selective etching of metal layers from the MAX phases, layered transition metal carbides and carbonitrides using hydrofluoric acid. Since then, multiple synthesis approaches have been developed, including selective etching in a mixture of fluoride salts and various acids, non&#8208;aqueous etchants, halogens, and molten salts, allowing for the synthesis of new MXenes with better control over their surface chemistries. Herein, a brief historical overview of the first 10 years of MXene research and a perspective on their synthesis and future development are provided. The fact that their production is readily scalable in aqueous environments, with high yields bodes well for their commercialization.

         <title>Micropatterns Fabricated by Photodimerization&#8208;Induced Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward yet powerful strategy to fabricate micropatterns on film surfaces is developed by spatially regulating the photodimerization and mass transport of maleimide. This technology integrates the characteristics of top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up methods, providing a versatile basis for applications in microfluidic channels, composite gratings, devices, and functional systems.








Abstract
Pattern technology plays an important role in the generation of microstructures with different functionalities and morphologies. In this report, a straightforward and versatile strategy is presented for spatially regulating the growth of a microstructure on a surface by the photodimerization of maleimide (MI). Upon exposure of ultraviolet (UV) light, photodimerization of MI in a film comprising furan&#8208;grafted polymer and bismaleimide (BMI) produces a chemical gradient, which can drive the diffusion of BMI from the unexposed to the exposed region and from the bottom to the surface, resulting in the growth of micropatterns. Sequential crosslinking induced by the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between MI and furan maintains the stability of pattern shape. Theoretical modeling with reaction&#8208;diffusion equations reveal that as photodimerization moves the system far from thermodynamic equilibrium, the formation of a chemical potential gradient requires the redistribution of matter, resulting in the formation of topographies. Directional molecular motion induced by UV light can generate complex morphology, and produce materials with unique optical functions, such as charming&#8208;ordered gratings. This straightforward method of fabricating micropatterns by photodimerization&#8208;induced diffusion is successfully applied to patterned curved surfaces, microfluidic channels and encapsulation of integrated light emitting diode chips.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Covalent Organic Framework Cathodes for Enhanced Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise molecular manipulation of redox&#8208;active groups in covalent organic framework (COF) units shows that quinone&#8208;functionalized COFs significantly enhance the specific capacity, elevate the discharge potential, and improve the competitiveness of Zn2+ against H+ intercalation through a stronger coordination bond between cations and C&#63742;O/C&#63742;N groups.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are potentially promising electrode materials for electrochemical charge storage applications thanks to their pre&#8208;designable reticular chemistry with atomic precision, allowing precise control of pore size, redox&#8208;active functional moieties, and stable covalent frameworks. However, studies on the mechanistic and practical aspects of their zinc&#8208;ion storage behavior are still limited. In this study, a strategy to enhance the electrochemical performance of COF cathodes in zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) by introducing the quinone group into 1,4,5,8,9,12&#8208;hexaazatriphenylene&#8208;based COFs is reported. Electrochemical characterization demonstrates that the introduction of the quinone groups in the COF significantly pushes up the Zn2+ storage capability against H+ and elevates the average (dis&#8208;)charge potential in aqueous ZIBs. Computational and experimental analysis further reveals the favorable redox&#8208;active sites that host Zn2+/H+ in COF electrodes and the root cause for the enhanced electrochemical performance. This work demonstrates that molecular engineering of the COF structure is an effective approach to achieve practical charge storage performance.

         <title>Synergistic Effects of Eu&#8208;MOF on Perovskite Solar Cells with Improved Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eu&#8208;MOF is introduced to the field of perovskite solar cells. Both Eu ions and organic ligands reduce the defect concentration. More over, due to the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer effect, Eu&#8208;MOF improves the light utilization. Meanwhile, it also turns tensile strain to compressive strain. Finally, the device performance, in efficiency and stability, is increased dramatically due to the synergetic effects.








Abstract
Enhancing device lifetime is one of the essential challenges in perovskite solar cells. The ultrathin Eu&#8208;MOF layer is introduced at the interface between the electron&#8208;transport layer and the perovskite absorber to improve the device stability. Both Eu ions and organic ligands in the MOF can reduce the defect concentration and improve carrier transport. Moreover, due to the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer effect, Eu&#8208;MOF in perovskite films can improve light utilization and reduce the decomposition under ultraviolet light. Meanwhile, Eu&#8208;MOF also turns tensile strain to compressive strain in the perovskite films. As a result, the corresponding devices achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.16%. In addition, the devices retain 96% of their original PCE after 2000 h under the relative humidity of 30% and 91% of their original PCE after 1200 h after continuous 85&#160;&#176;C aging condition in N2.

         <title>Bitter Flavored, Soft Composites for Wearables Designed to Reduce Risks of Choking in Infants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bitter&#8208;flavored formulations in soft encapsulating layers and hydrogel adhesives for skin&#8208;interfaced wireless devices reduce risks of choking with infants. A bitter dopant, denatonium benzoate, integrated into soft silicone elastomers and hydrogels triggers a reflexive response when dissolved in saliva. Demonstrations in a variety of devices for physiological monitoring highlight the compatibility of these unusual composite materials in clinical&#8208;grade wearables.








Abstract
Wireless, skin&#8208;integrated devices for continuous, clinical&#8208;quality monitoring of vital signs have the potential to greatly improve the care of patients in neonatal and pediatric intensive&#8208;care units. These same technologies can also be used in the home, across a broad spectrum of ages, from beginning to end of life. Although miniaturized forms of such devices minimize patient burden and improve compliance, they represent life&#8208;threatening choking hazards for infants. A materials strategy is presented here to address this concern. Specifically, composite materials are introduced as soft encapsulating layers and gentle adhesives that release chemical compounds designed to elicit an intense bitter taste when placed in the mouth. Reflexive reactions to this sensation strongly reduce the potential for ingestion, as a safety feature. The materials systems described involve a non&#8208;toxic bitterant (denatonium benzoate) as a dopant in an elastomeric (poly(dimethylsiloxane)) or hydrogel matrix. Experimental and computational studies of these composite materials and the kinetics of release of the bitterant define the key properties. Incorporation into various wireless skin&#8208;integrated sensors demonstrates their utility in functional systems. This simple strategy offers valuable protective capabilities, with broad practical relevance to the welfare of children monitored with wearable devices.

         <title>A Highly Compressible and Stretchable Carbon Spring for Smart Vibration and Magnetism Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous spring&#8208;like all&#8208;carbon material achieving both elastic compressibility and stretchability at large strain from &#8722;80% to 80% is obtained when a unique long&#8208;range lamellar multi&#8208;arch microstructure is designed. The excellent mechanical performance combined with the intrinsic advantages of carbon makes it a promising platform for making smart vibration and magnetism sensors that can work at extreme temperatures.








Abstract
Porous carbon materials demonstrate extensive applications for their attractive characteristics. Mechanical flexibility is an essential property guaranteeing their durability. After decades of research efforts, compressive brittleness of porous carbon materials is well resolved. However, reversible stretchability remains challenging to achieve due to the intrinsically weak connections and fragile joints of the porous carbon networks. Herein, it is presented that a porous all&#8208;carbon material achieving both elastic compressibility and stretchability at large strain from &#8722;80% to 80% can be obtained when a unique long&#8208;range lamellar multi&#8208;arch microstructure is introduced. Impressively, the porous all&#8208;carbon material can maintain reliable structural robustness and durability under loading condition of cyclic compressing&#8211;stretching process, similar to a real metallic spring. The unique performance renders it as a promising platform for making smart vibration and magnetism sensors, even capable of operating at extreme temperatures. Furthermore, this study provides valuable insights for creating highly stretchable and compressible porous materials from other neat inorganic components for diverse applications in future.

         <title>Hollow InVO4 Nanocuboid Assemblies toward Promoting Photocatalytic N2 Conversion Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The InVO4 superstructure with a cube&#8208;shaped skeleton and hollow interior is synthesized. The closely ordered assembly of nanocuboids improves the separation of electron&#8211;hole pairs through promoted charge transfer among neighboring building blocks. This promising charge mobility feature contributes to the pronounced photocatalytic performance of InVO4 superstrucure toward N2 fixation into NH3.








Abstract
The unique InVO4 mesocrystal superstructure, particularly with cubical skeleton and hollow interior, which consists of numerous nanocube building blocks, closely stacking by stacking, aligning by aligning, and sharing the same crystallographic orientations, is successfully fabricated. The synergy of a reaction&#8208;limited aggregation and an Ostwald ripening process is reasonably proposed for the growth of this unique superstructure. Both single&#8208;particle surface photovoltage and confocal fluorescence spectroscopy measurements demonstrate that the long&#8208;range ordered mesocrystal superstructures can significantly retard the recombination of electron&#8211;hole pairs through the creation of a new pathway for anisotropic electron flow along the inter&#8208;nanocubes. This promising charge mobility feature of the superstructure greatly contributes to the pronounced photocatalytic performance of the InVO4 mesocrystal toward fixation of N2 into NH3 with the quantum yield of 0.50% at wavelength of 385&#160;nm.

         <title>Ultrafast Bubble Bursting by Superamphiphobic Coatings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superamphiphobic surfaces for ultrafast bubble bursting are introduced. Liquid flame spray is fast and scalable, and allows tuning of the nano&#8208; and micrometer&#8208;scale architecture of hierarchical surface structures. Bubbles burst rapidly upon contact and the gas is absorbed into the surface structures. The recorded rates are enhanced by a factor of 3 relative to previously reported results.








Abstract
Controlling bubble motion or passively bursting bubbles using solid interfaces is advantageous in numerous industrial applications including flotation, catalysis, electrochemical processes, and microfluidics. Current research has explored the formation, dissolution, pinning, and rupturing of bubbles on different surfaces. However, the ability to tune and control the rate of bubble bursting is not yet achieved. Scaling down surface&#8208;induced bubble bursting to just a few milliseconds is important for any application. In this work, the hierarchical structure of superamphiphobic surfaces is tuned in order to rapidly rupture contacting bubbles. Surfaces prepared using liquid flame spray show ultrafast bubble bursting (down to 2&#160;ms) and superior durability. The coatings demonstrate excellent mechanical and chemical stability even in the presence of surface&#8208;active species. Air from the ruptured bubble is absorbed into the aerophilic Cassie&#8208;state. Long&#8208;term applicability is demonstrated by preventing the accumulation of air in the plastron via a connection of the plastron to the environment. The times recorded for bubble rupture and complete reorganization of air are reduced by approximately a factor of 3 compared to previously reported values. The concept is utilized to passively control surfactant&#8208;rich foam in froth flotation. Material collection efficiency increased by more than 60&#160;times compared to controls.

         <title>Synaptic Plasticity Powering Long&#8208;Afterglow Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synaptic indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide (IGZO) layer is integrated into a novel organic light&#8208;emitting transistor (OLET) device. The UV&#8208;light&#8208;driven photoinduced synaptic effect is used to power a persistent bright afterglow emission in an organic light&#8208;emitting material. The unique OLETs are integrated in active&#8208;matrix light&#8208;emitting arrays operating as visual UV sensors capable of long&#8208;lifetime green&#8208;light emission in the irradiated regions.








Abstract
Long&#8208;lasting luminescence in optoelectronic devices is highly sought after for applications in optical data storage and display technology. While in light&#8208;emitting diodes this is achieved by exploiting long&#8208;afterglow organic materials as active components, such a strategy has never been pursued in light&#8208;emitting transistors, which are still rather unexplored and whose technological potential is yet to be demonstrated. Herein, the fabrication of long&#8208;afterglow organic light&#8208;emitting transistors (LAOLETs) is reported whose operation relies on an unprecedented strategy based on a photoinduced synaptic effect in an inorganic indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide (IGZO) semiconducting channel layer, to power a persistent electroluminescence in organic light&#8208;emitting materials. Oxygen vacancies in the IGZO layer, produced by irradiation at &#955;&#160;= 312&#160;nm, free electrons in excess yielding to a channel conductance increase. Due to the slow recombination kinetics of photogenerated electrons to oxygen vacancies in the channel layer, the organic material can be fueled by postsynaptic current and displays a long&#8208;lived light&#8208;emission (hundreds of seconds) after ceasing UV irradiation. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the LAOLETs are integrated in active&#8208;matrix light&#8208;emitting arrays operating as visual UV sensors capable of long&#8208;lifetime green&#8208;light emission in the irradiated regions.

         <title>A Zwitterionic Polyurethane Nanoporous Device with Low Foreign&#8208;Body Response for Islet Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zwitterionic nanofibrous islet encapsulation device made of sulfobetaine&#8208;modified polyurethane is reported. The device is mechanically robust, effective in preventing cell entrance or escape, hydrophilic with facile mass transfer, and biocompatible with low levels of fibrotic deposition in mice, dogs, and pigs. These attributes make it an attractive candidate for safe delivery of insulin&#8208;producing cells to treat type 1 diabetes.








Abstract
Encapsulation of insulin&#8208;producing cells is a promising strategy for treatment of type 1 diabetes. However, engineering an encapsulation device that is both safe (i.e., no cell escape and no breakage) and functional (i.e., low foreign&#8208;body response (FBR) and high mass transfer) remains a challenge. Here, a family of zwitterionic polyurethanes (ZPU) with sulfobetaine groups in the polymer backbone is developed, which are fabricated into encapsulation devices with tunable nanoporous structures via electrospinning. The ZPU encapsulation device is hydrophilic and fouling&#8208;resistant, exhibits robust mechanical properties, and prevents cell escape while still allowing efficient mass transfer. The ZPU device also induces a much lower FBR or cellular overgrowth upon intraperitoneal implantation in C57BL/6 mice for up to 6 months compared to devices made of similar polyurethane without the zwitterionic modification. The therapeutic potential of the ZPU device is shown for islet encapsulation and diabetes correction in mice for &#8776;3 months is demonstrated. As a proof of concept, the scalability and retrievability of the ZPU device in pigs and dogs are further demonstrated. Collectively, these attributes make ZPU devices attractive candidates for cell encapsulation therapies.

         <title>High&#8208;Strength and Nonfouling Zwitterionic Triple&#8208;Network Hydrogel in Saline Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective strategy is developed to achieve both high mechanical strength and excellent nonfouling properties in saline environments, important for biomedical and engineering applications, by constructing a pure zwitterionic triple&#8208;network hydrogel. Strong chain entanglement and electrostatic interactions provide effective energy dissipation to improve the mechanical strength and toughness of the hydrogel.








Abstract
Zwitterionic hydrogels have received great attention due to their excellent nonfouling and biocompatible properties, but they suffer from weak mechanical strength in the saline environments important for biomedical and engineering applications due to the &#8220;anti&#8208;polyelectrolyte&#8221; effect. Conventional strategies to introduce hydrophobic or non&#8208;zwitterionic components to increase mechanical strength compromise their nonfouling properties. Here, a highly effective strategy is reported to achieve both high mechanical strength and excellent nonfouling properties by constructing a pure zwitterionic triple&#8208;network (ZTN) hydrogel. The strong electrostatic interaction and network entanglement within the triple&#8208;network structure can effectively dissipate energy to toughen the hydrogel and achieve high strength, toughness, and stiffness in saline environments (compressive fracture stress 18.2 &#177; 1.4&#160;MPa,&#160;toughness 1.62 &#177; 0.03&#160;MJ m&#8211;3,&#160;and modulus 0.66 &#177; 0.03&#160;MPa&#160;in seawater environments). Moreover, the ZTN hydrogel is shown to strongly resist the attachment of proteins, bacteria, and cells. The results provide a fundamental understanding to guide the design of tough nonfouling zwitterionic hydrogels for a broad range of applications.

         <title>Modular Assembly of Tumor&#8208;Penetrating and Oligomeric Nanozyme Based on Intrinsically Self&#8208;Assembling Protein Nanocages</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
It remains challenging to precisely control and reproducibly formulate nanomedicines. A nanomaterial&#8208;based synthetic biology strategy is established for tailoring oligomeric nanostructures and a series of artificial metalloenzymes in a precisely controlled manner, which offers an option for tailored anticancer nanomedicines that have a high degree of control over both geometry and valency.








Abstract
Biomimetic design of nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like characteristics has emerged as a promising method for the generation of novel therapeutics. However, synthesis of nanomaterials while maintaining a high degree of control over both geometry and valency poses a prominent challenge. Herein, the authors introduce a nanomaterial&#8208;based synthetic biology strategy for accurate and quantitative tailoring of high&#8208;ordered nanostructures that uses a &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; hierarchical incorporation of protein building blocks. The assembled nano&#8208;oligomers possessed tunable protein motifs and multivalent binding domains, which facilitated prolonged blood circulation time, accumulation within tumor cells through direct targeting of cell receptors, and deep tumor tissue penetration via a transcytosis mechanism. Using these protein/protein nano&#8208;oligomers as scaffolds, the authors created a new series of artificial nano&#8208;scaled metalloenzymes (nanozymes) by the in situ incorporation of metal nanoclusters within the cavity of the protein nanocages. Nanozymes were&#160;capable of mimicking peroxidase&#8208;like activity and generated cytotoxic free radicals. Compared to nanozyme alone, the systemic delivery of oligomeric nanozymes demonstrated significantly enhanced therapeutic and anti&#8208;tumor benefits. This study shows a new insight into nanotechnology by taking advantage of synthetic biotechnology.

         <title>Hydrophilicity&#8208;Hydrophobicity Transformation, Thermoresponsive Morphomechanics, and Crack Multifurcation Revealed by AIEgens in Mechanically Strong Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct visualization of microphase separation and easy differentiation of hydrophilicity&#8211;hydrophobicity transformation is achieved in a facile, high&#8208;contrast, and noninvasive manner by using luminogens with aggregation&#8208;induced emission as fluorescent indicators. Based on the morphological observation and mechanical study, the concept of morphomechanics with a comprehensive mechanism clarification is proposed.








Abstract
Biomimetic exploration of stimuli&#8208;responsive and crack&#8208;resistant hydrogels is of great academic and practical significance, although the rational design of tough hydrogels is limited by insufficient mechanism study due to the lack of imaging techniques to &#8220;see&#8221; hydrogels at mesoscale level. A series of composite hydrogels with compartmentalized thermal response is designed by incorporating aggregation&#8208; and polarity&#8208;sensitive fluorescent probes in a poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) network grafted with poly(N,N&#8208;dimethylacrylamide) side&#8208;chains. The fluorescence technique is explored as a powerful tool to directly visualize their hydrophilicity&#8208;hydrophobicity transformation and the composition&#8208;dependent microphase separation. Based on the morphological observation and mechanical measurements, the concept of morphomechanics with a comprehensive mechanism clarification is proposed. In this regard, the thermoresponsive toughening is attributed to the formation of multiple noncovalent interactions and the conformational changes of PNIPAM chains. The enhanced fracture energy by crack multifurcation is related to the tearing&#8208;like disruption of weak interfaces between the separated phases.

&lt;p&gt;The direct visualization of microphase separation and easy differentiation of hydrophilicity&#8211;hydrophobicity transformation is achieved in a facile, high-contrast, and noninvasive manner by using luminogens with aggregation-induced emission as fluorescent indicators. Based on the morphological observation and mechanical study, the concept of morphomechanics with a comprehensive mechanism clarification is proposed.

         <title>Metavalent Bonding in Crystalline Solids: How Does It Collapse?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metavalent bonding in solids is shown to differ significantly from covalent bonding, as demonstrated by pronounced property changes for optical, vibrational, electronic, and structural properties upon the transition from covalent to metavalent bonding. This insight and the resulting map showing trends in chemical bonding and material properties can be used to design and tailor materials.








Abstract
The chemical bond is one of the most powerful, yet much debated concepts in chemistry, explaining property trends in solids. Recently, a novel type of chemical bonding was&#160;identified in several higher chalcogenides, characterized by a unique property portfolio, unconventional bond breaking, and sharing of about one electron between adjacent atoms. This metavalent bond is a fundamental type of bonding in solids, besides covalent, ionic, and metallic bonding, raising the pertinent question as to whether there is a well&#8208;defined transition between metavalent and covalent bonds. Here, three different pseudo&#8208;binary lines, namely, GeTe1&#8722;xSex, Sb2Te3(1&#8722;x)Se3x, and Bi2&#8722;2xSb2xSe3, are studied, and a sudden change in several properties, including optical absorption &#949;2(&#969;), optical dielectric constant &#949;&#8734;, Born effective charge Z*, electrical conductivity, as well as bond breaking behavior for a critical Se or Sb concentration, is evidenced. These findings provide a blueprint to experimentally explore the influence of metavalent bonding on attractive properties of phase&#8208;change materials and thermoelectrics. Particularly important is its impact on optical properties, which can be tailored by the amount of electrons shared between adjacent atoms. This correlation can be used to design optoelectronic materials and to explore systematic changes in chemical bonding with stoichiometry and atomic arrangement.

         <title>Photonic Bandgap in Achiral Liquid Crystals&#8212;A Twist on a Twist</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photonic bandgap phenomenon is observed in a liquid crystalline phase built of achiral molecules, in which a tendency to twist is caused by steric interactions between strongly bent molecules. A selective reflection of visible light appears due to unwinding of the helical structure at the transition between two smectic phases having a single&#8208; and double&#8208;helical structure.








Abstract
Achiral mesogenic molecules are shown to be able to spontaneously assemble into liquid crystalline smectic phases having either simple or double&#8208;helical structures. At the transition between these phases, the double&#8208;helical structure unwinds. As a consequence, in some temperature range, the pitch of the helix becomes comparable to the wavelength of visible light and the selective reflection of light in the visible range is observed. The photonic bandgap phenomenon is reported for achiral liquid crystals.

         <title>A Sustainable and Flexible Microbrush&#8208;Faced Triboelectric Generator for Portable/Wearable Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microbrush&#8208;faced triboelectric nanogenerator featuring high robustness, outstanding sustainability, and excellent durability displays remarkable capability for mechanical energy harvesting in separate working modes. Human&#8208;being&#8208;interactive triboelectrification with this device reveals outstanding power generation and durability, suggesting that it can serve as a power source for various types of handheld electronics.








Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are put forward as a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art energy&#8208;scavenging technology for self&#8208;powered electronics, but their severe wear and degradation driven by inevitable friction can pose significant durability and sustainability concerns. Here, an array of microfibers is reported that functions as a robust and sustainable TENG in both in&#8208;plane sliding and vertical contact&#8208;separation modes, with excellent electrical potential as high as 20&#160;V and a high cyclability of 3000. The design flexibility of this microbrush TENG (MB&#8208;TENG) on the counter materials facilitates the further improvement of electrical outputs, benefiting numerous applications of human&#8208;interactive triboelectrification. Significantly, these MB&#8208;TENGs offer sufficient output power for successfully driving a smartwatch as well as an electromyography module. This technology uses a simple and cost&#8208;effective manner to provide a robust and reliable monolithic TENG module, which is expected to serve as a promising energy&#8208;harvesting source for self&#8208;powered electronics in the near future.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Induced Cooperative Transition in Molecular Electronic Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A major challenge in a supramolecular electronic crystal is switchable control of its hidden phase. The cooperative tuning of K&#8208;TCNQ through a pulsed electromagnetic field into an emergent electronic disorder state, enabling access to a long&#8208;lived (over 400 days) hidden conducting phase, is found. A switchable magneto&#8208;electronic bistability is realized in a broad temperature range from 2 to 360 K.








Abstract
The competing and non&#8208;equilibrium phase transitions, involving dynamic tunability of cooperative electronic and magnetic states in strongly correlated materials, show great promise in quantum sensing and information technology. To date, the stabilization of transient states is still in the preliminary stage, particularly with respect to molecular electronic solids. Here, a dynamic and cooperative phase in potassium&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (K&#8208;TCNQ) with the control of pulsed electromagnetic excitation is demonstrated. Simultaneous dynamic and coherent lattice perturbation with 8 ns&#160;pulsed laser (532&#160;nm, 15 MW&#160;cm&#8722;2, 10 Hz)&#160;in such a molecular electronic crystal initiates a stable long&#8208;lived (over 400 days) conducting paramagnetic state (&#8776;42 &#937;cm), showing the charge&#8211;spin bistability over a broad temperature range from 2 to 360 K. Comprehensive noise spectroscopy, in situ high&#8208;pressure measurements, electron spin resonance (ESR), theoretical model, and scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) studies provide further evidence that such a transition is cooperative, requiring a dedicated charge&#8211;spin&#8211;lattice decoupling to activate and subsequently stabilize nonequilibrium phase. The cooperativity triggered by ultrahigh&#8208;strain&#8208;rate (above 106 s&#8722;1) pulsed excitation offers a collective control toward the generation and stabilization of strongly correlated electronic and magnetic orders in molecular electronic solids and offers unique electro&#8208;magnetic phases with technological promises.

         <title>Daratumumab Immunopolymersome&#8208;Enabled Safe and CD38&#8208;Targeted Chemotherapy and Depletion of Multiple Myeloma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Immuno&#8208;nanomedicines are emerging targeted cancer therapeutics that might reshape the clinical treatment scheme. Novel fabrication of small and smart daratumumab immunopolymersomes is presented carrying vincristine sulfate that induce extraordinary potency and selectivity while mitigating systemic toxicity toward orthotopic multiple myeloma in vivo.








Abstract
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a second ranking hematological malignancy. Despite the fast advancement of new treatments such as bortezormib and daratumumab, MM patients remain incurable and tend to eventually become relapsed and drug&#8208;resistant. Development of novel therapies capable of depleting MM cells is strongly needed. Here, daratumumab immunopolymersomes carrying vincristine sulfate (Dar&#8208;IPs&#8208;VCR) are reported for safe and high&#8208;efficacy CD38&#8208;targeted chemotherapy and depletion of orthotopic MM in vivo. Dar&#8208;IPs&#8208;VCR made by postmodification via strain&#8208;promoted click reaction holds tailored antibody density (2.2, 4.4 to 8.7 Dar per IPs), superb stability, small size (43&#8211;49&#160;nm), efficacious VCR loading, and glutathione&#8208;responsive VCR release. Dar4.4&#8208;IPs&#8208;VCR induces exceptional anti&#8208;MM activity with an IC50 of 76 &#215; 10&#8722;12 m to CD38&#8208;positive LP&#8208;1&#160;MM cells, 12&#8208; and 20&#8208;fold enhancement over nontargeted Ps&#8208;VCR and free VCR controls, respectively. Intriguingly, mice bearing orthotopic LP&#8208;1&#8208;Luc MM following four cycles of i.v. administration of Dar4.4&#8208;IPs&#8208;VCR at 0.25&#160;mg VCR equiv. kg&#8722;1 reveal complete depletion of LP&#8208;1&#8208;Luc cells, superior survival rate to all controls, and no body weight loss. The bone and histological analyses indicate bare bone and organ damage. Dar&#8208;IPs&#8208;VCR appears as a safe and targeted treatment for CD38&#8208;overexpressed hematological malignancies.

         <title>Improving the Stability of Non&#8208;Noble&#8208;Metal M&#8211;N&#8211;C Catalysts for Proton&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Membrane Fuel Cells through M&#8211;N Bond Length and Coordination Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective and universal strategy is developed to improve the stability of M&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts in half&#8208;cell and H2&#8211;O2/air fuel cells by accurately regulating the M&#63743;N bond length/coordination. Interestingly, the Fe&#63743;N bond length/coordination of the catalysts are strongly dependent on the binding constant of Fe3+ and polymer in the precursors, which can be linked with their performance degradation in fuel cells.








Abstract
An effective and universal strategy is developed to enhance the stability of the non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal M&#8211;Nx/C catalyst in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) by improving the bonding strength between metal ions and chelating polymers, i.e., poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) homopolymer and poly(acrylic acid&#8211;maleic acid) (P(AA&#8208;MA)) copolymer with different AA/MA ratios. M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveal that the optimal P(AA&#8208;MA)&#8211;Fe&#8211;N catalyst with a higher Fe3+&#8211;polymer binding constant possesses longer Fe&#63743;N bonds and exclusive Fe&#8211;N4/C moiety compared to PAA&#8211;Fe&#8211;N, which consists of &#8776;15% low&#8208;coordinated Fe&#8211;N2/N3 structures. The optimized P(AA&#8208;MA)&#8211;Fe&#8211;N catalyst exhibits outstanding ORR activity and stability in both half&#8208;cell and PEMFC cathodes, with the retention rate of current density approaching 100% for the first 37 h at 0.55&#160;V in an H2&#8211;air fuel cell. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the Fe&#8211;N4/C site could optimize the difference between the adsorption energy of the Fe atoms on the support (Ead) and the bulk cohesive energy (Ecoh) relative to Fe&#8211;N2/N3 moieties, thereby strongly stabilizing Fe centers against demetalation.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly tunable superconducting&#8211;semiconducting hybrid junction based on intrinsic germanium (i&#8208;Ge) nanowires is revealed. Low&#8208;temperature transport measurements of ultrascaled monolithic Al&#8211;Ge&#8211;Al nanowire heterostructures featuring monocrystalline Al leads and abrupt Al&#8211;Ge interfaces demonstrate that such i&#8208;Ge quantum dot devices can be tuned to access three distinct regimes: single&#8208;hole&#8208;filling quantum dots, an intermediate sub&#8208;gap states regime, and a superconducting regime.








Abstract
Superconductor&#8211;semiconductor&#8211;superconductor heterostructures are attractive for both fundamental studies of quantum phenomena in low&#8208;dimensional hybrid systems as well as for future high&#8208;performance low power dissipating nanoelectronic and quantum devices. In this work, ultrascaled monolithic Al&#8211;Ge&#8211;Al nanowire heterostructures featuring monocrystalline Al leads and abrupt metal&#8211;semiconductor interfaces are used to probe the low&#8208;temperature transport in intrinsic Ge (i&#8208;Ge) quantum dots. In particular, demonstrating the ability to tune the Ge quantum dot device from completely insulating, through a single&#8208;hole&#8208;filling quantum dot regime, to a supercurrent regime, resembling a Josephson field effect transistor with a maximum critical current of 10 nA at a temperature of 390 mK. The realization of a Josephson field&#8208;effect transistor with high junction transparency provides a mechanism to study sub&#8208;gap transport mediated by Andreev states. The presented results reveal a promising intrinsic Ge&#8208;based architecture for hybrid superconductor&#8211;semiconductor devices for the study of Majorana zero modes and key components of quantum computing such as gatemons or gate tunable superconducting quantum interference devices.

         <title>Anisotropic Iridescence and Polarization Patterns in a Direct Ink Written Chiral Photonic Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by natural examples of patterned iridescence, an ink based on a chiral nematic liquid crystal that can be processed with a direct ink writer 3D printer is shown. Tuning the writing direction and speed leads to the programmed formation of a slanted photonic axis that exhibits atypical iridescence and polarization selectivity.








Abstract
The iridescence of structural color and its polarization characteristics originate from the nanoscale organization of materials. A major challenge in materials science is generating the bright, lustrous hues seen in nature through nanoscale engineering, while simultaneously controlling interaction of the material with different light polarizations. In this work, a suitable chiral nematic liquid crystal elastomer ink is synthesized for direct ink writing, which self&#8208;assembles into a chiral photonic structure. Tuning the writing direction and speed leads to the programmed formation of a slanted photonic axis, which exhibits atypical iridescence and polarization selectivity. After crosslinking, a freely programmable, chiroptical photonic polymer material is obtained. The strongly perspective&#8208;dependent appearance of the material can function as specialized anticounterfeit markers, as optical elements in decorative iridescent coatings, or, as demonstrated here, in optically based signaling features.

&lt;p&gt;The iridescence of structural color and its polarization characteristics originate from the nanoscale organization of materials. A major challenge in materials science is generating the bright, lustrous hues seen in nature through nanoscale engineering, while simultaneously controlling interaction of the material with different light polarizations. In this work, a suitable chiral nematic liquid crystal elastomer ink is synthesized for direct ink writing, which self-assembles into a chiral photonic structure. Tuning the writing direction and speed leads to the programmed formation of a slanted photonic axis, which exhibits atypical iridescence and polarization selectivity. After crosslinking, a freely programmable, chiroptical photonic polymer material is obtained. The strongly perspective-dependent appearance of the material can function as specialized anticounterfeit markers, as optical elements in decorative iridescent coatings, or, as demonstrated here, in optically based signaling features.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic Symmetry Breaking in Chiral Magnetic Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel domain growth behaviors are observed with respect to in&#8208;plane magnetic fields in [Co/Ni/Pt] multilayers with chiral N&#233;el&#8208;type domain walls (DWs), including growth perpendicular to the in&#8208;plane field axis. Accounting for steady&#8208;state DW dynamics, the reported model successfully predicts the magnetization and energetic profiles that promote these asymmetries. These results expand the utility of DW motion in probing chiral magnetism.








Abstract
The Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction (DMI) in magnetic systems stabilizes spin textures with preferred chirality, applicable to next&#8208;generation memory and computing architectures. In perpendicularly magnetized heavy&#8208;metal/ferromagnet films, the interfacial DMI originating from structural inversion asymmetry and strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling favors chiral N&#233;el&#8208;type domain walls (DWs) whose energetics and mobility remain at issue. Here, a new effect is characterized in which domains expand unidirectionally in response to a combination of out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane magnetic fields, with the growth direction controlled by the in&#8208;plane field strength. These growth directionalities and symmetries with applied fields cannot be understood from static treatments alone. The authors theoretically demonstrate that perpendicular field torques stabilize steady&#8208;state magnetization profiles highly asymmetric in elastic energy, resulting in a dynamic symmetry breaking consistent with the experimental findings. This phenomenon sheds light on the mechanisms governing the dynamics of N&#233;el&#8208;type DWs and expands the utility of field&#8208;driven DW motion to probe and control chiral DWs.

&lt;p&gt;Novel domain growth behaviors are observed with respect to in-plane magnetic fields in [Co/Ni/Pt] multilayers with chiral N&#233;el-type domain walls (DWs), including growth perpendicular to the in-plane field axis. Accounting for steady-state DW dynamics, the reported model successfully predicts the magnetization and energetic profiles that promote these asymmetries.

         <title>Reduced Intrinsic Non&#8208;Radiative Losses Allow Room&#8208;Temperature Triplet Emission from Purely Organic Emitters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substitution of a hydrogen atom with an N&#8208;phenyl ring is demonstrated to convert an organic material without phosphorescence emission into a molecular system exhibiting efficient and ultralong afterglow phosphorescence at room temperature, originating from a reduction of intrinsic non&#8208;radiative molecular relaxations, which can be used for data safety applications.








Abstract
Persistent luminescence from triplet excitons in organic molecules is rare, as fast non&#8208;radiative deactivation typically dominates over radiative transitions. This work demonstrates that the substitution of a hydrogen atom in a derivative of phenanthroimidazole with an N&#8208;phenyl ring can substantially stabilize the excited state. This stabilization converts an organic material without phosphorescence emission into a molecular system exhibiting efficient and ultralong afterglow phosphorescence at room temperature. Results from systematic photophysical investigations, kinetic modeling, excited&#8208;state dynamic modeling, and single&#8208;crystal structure analysis identify that the long&#8208;lived triplets originate from a reduction of intrinsic non&#8208;radiative molecular relaxations. Further modification of the N&#8208;phenyl ring with halogen atoms affects the afterglow lifetime and quantum yield. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, an anticounterfeiting device is demonstrated with a time&#8208;dependent Morse code feature for data encryption based on these emitters. A fundamental design principle is outlined to achieve long&#8208;lived and emissive triplet states by suppressing intrinsic non&#8208;radiative relaxations in the form of molecular vibrations or rotations.

         <title>54 cm2 Large&#8208;Area Flexible Organic Solar Modules with Efficiency Above 13%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient large&#8208;area flexible solar cells and modules are demonstrated based on a printable, transparent, low&#8208;surface&#8208;roughness, flexible electrode (silver nanowires:zinc&#8208;chelated polyethylenimine). A power conversion efficiency of 13.2% is obtained for a 54 cm2 solar module. The flexible electrode is also demonstrated in high&#8208;performance flexible quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes.








Abstract
Development of large&#8208;area flexible organic solar cells (OSCs) is highly desirable for their practical applications. However, the efficiency of the large&#8208;area flexible OSCs severely lags behind small&#8208;area devices. Here, efficient large&#8208;area flexible single cells with power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.1% and 12.6% for areas of 6 and 10 cm2, and flexible modules with a PCE of 13.2% (54 cm2) based on poly(ethylene terephthalate)/Ag grid/silver nanowires (AgNWs):zinc&#8208;chelated polyethylenimine (PEI&#8208;Zn) composite electrodes are reported. The solution&#8208;processed flexible transparent electrode of AgNWs:PEI&#8208;Zn shows low surface roughness and good optoelectronic and mechanical properties. PEI&#8208;Zn is conductive and optically transparent. It can adhere to and wrap the AgNWs under electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged surface (AgNWs) and positively charged protonated amine groups (in PEI&#8208;Zn). It wraps the AgNWs networks and fills the void space to achieve a smooth surface. The flexible electrode is validated in both flexible OSCs and flexible quantum&#8208;dots light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs). Small&#8208;area flexible OSCs show a PCE of 16.1%, and flexible QLEDs show an external quantum efficiency of 13.3%. In the end, a flexible module is demonstrated to charge a mobile phone as a flexible power source (shown in Video S1, Supporting Information).

         <title>A Bioresorbable Dynamic Pressure Sensor for Cardiovascular Postoperative Care</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioresorbable electronics that can be absorbed and become part of the organism after their service life are a new trend to avoid secondary invasive surgery. A flexible bioresorbable triboelectric pressure sensor is demonstrated based on the triboelectric effect. It can overcome the material limitations caused by the working principle. This device is expected to be applied in postoperative care.








Abstract
Bioresorbable electronics that can be absorbed and become part of the organism after their service life are a new trend to avoid secondary invasive surgery. However, the material limitation is a significant challenge. There are fewer biodegradable materials with pressure&#8208;sensitive properties. Here, a pressure sensor based on the triboelectric effect between bioabsorbable materials is reported. This effect is available in almost all materials. The bioresorbable triboelectric sensor (BTS) can directly convert ambient pressure changes into electrical signals. This device successfully identifies abnormal vascular occlusion events in large animals (dogs). The service life of the BTS reaches 5 days with a high service efficiency (5.95%). The BTS offers excellent sensitivity (11 mV&#160;mmHg&#8722;1), linearity (R2&#160;= 0.993), and good durability (450&#160;000 cycles). The antibacterial bioresorbable materials (poly(lactic acid)&#8211;(chitosan 4%)) for the BTS can achieve 99% sterilization. Triboelectric devices are expected to be applied in postoperative care as bioresorbable electronics.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Halide Perovskite Field&#8208;Effect Transistors by Ion Transport Mitigation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Realization of solution&#8208;processed halide perovskites transistors is challenging due to the presence of mobile ions. A generic strategy is demonstrated that can be applied for regulating ions in mixed ionic&#8211;electronic semiconductors and that enables the demonstration of perovskite transistors working at room&#8208;temperature by fixation of the mobile ions through ferroelectric polarization. 








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed halide perovskites have emerged as excellent optoelectronic materials for applications in photovoltaic solar cells and light&#8208;emitting diodes. However, the presence of mobile ions in the material hinders the development of perovskite field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) due to screening of the gate potential in the nearby perovskite channel, and the resulting impediment to achieving gate modulation of an electronic current at room temperature. Here, room&#8208;temperature operation is demonstrated in cesium lead tribromide (CsPbBr3) perovskite&#8208;based FETs using an auxiliary ferroelectric gate of poly(vinylidenefluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene) [P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)], to electrostatically fixate the mobile ions. The large interfacial polarization of the ferroelectric gate attracts the mobile ions away from the main nonferroelectric gate interface, thereby enabling modulation of the electronic current through the channel by the main gate. This strategy allows for realization of the p&#8208;type CsPbBr3 channel and revealing the thermally activated nature of the hole charge transport. The proposed strategy is generic and can be applied for regulating ions in a variety of ionic&#8211;electronic mixed semiconductors.

         <title>A Tandem Organic Photovoltaic Cell with 19.6% Efficiency Enabled by Light Distribution Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By fine&#8208;tuning the optical field distribution and employing photovoltaic materials with low energy losses in tandem photovoltaic cell, a power conversion efficiency of 19.64% is achieved.








Abstract
Despite more potential in realizing higher photovoltaic performance, the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of tandem organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells still lags behind that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art single&#8208;junction cells. In this work, highly efficient double&#8208;junction tandem OPV cells are fabricated by optimizing the photoactive layers with low voltage losses and developing an effective method to tune optical field distribution. The tandem OPV cells studied are structured as indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/bottom photoactive layer/interconnecting layer (ICL)/top photoactive layer/MoOx/Ag, where the bottom and top photoactive layers are based on blends of PBDB&#8208;TF:ITCC and PBDB&#8208;TF:BTP&#8208;eC11, respectively, and ICL refers to interconnecting layer structured as MoOx/Ag/ZnO:PFN&#8208;Br. As these results indicate that there is not much room for optimizing the bottom photoactive layer, more effort is put into fine&#8208;tuning the top photoactive layer. By rationally modulating the composition and thickness of PBDB&#8208;TF:BTP&#8208;eC11 blend films, the 300 nm&#8208;thick PBDB&#8208;TF:BTP&#8208;eC11 film with 1:2 D/A ratio is found to be an ideal photoactive layer for the top sub&#8208;cell in terms of photovoltaic characteristics and light distribution control. For the optimized tandem cell, a PCE of 19.64% is realized, which is the highest result in the OPV field and certified as 19.50% by the National Institute of Metrology.

         <title>Magnetization Signature of Topological Surface States in a Non&#8208;Symmorphic Superconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly anomalous surface superconductivity is reported in a non&#8208;symmorphic superconductor, In2Bi, where the nontrivial band structure results in the existence of topologically protected surface states (TSS). The near&#8208;perfect screening of low&#8208;frequency magnetic fields well above the upper critical field is explained by proximity superconductivity of TSS. Detecting TSS via macroscopic magnetization provides a new tool for identification of topological superconductors.








Abstract
Superconductors with nontrivial band structure topology represent a class of materials with unconventional and potentially useful properties. Recent years have seen much success in creating artificial hybrid structures exhibiting the main characteristics of 2D topological superconductors. Yet, bulk materials known to combine inherent superconductivity with nontrivial topology remain scarce, largely because distinguishing their central characteristic&#8212;the topological surface states&#8212;has proved challenging due to a dominant contribution from the superconducting bulk. In this work, a highly anomalous behavior of surface superconductivity in topologically nontrivial 3D superconductor In2Bi, where the surface states result from its nontrivial band structure, itself a consequence of the non&#8208;symmorphic crystal symmetry and strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling, is reported. In contrast to smoothly decreasing diamagnetic susceptibility above the bulk critical field, Hc2, as seen in conventional superconductors, a near&#8208;perfect, Meissner&#8208;like screening of low&#8208;frequency magnetic fields well above Hc2 is observed. The enhanced diamagnetism disappears at a new phase transition close to the critical field of surface superconductivity, Hc3. Using theoretical modeling, the anomalous screening is shown to be consistent with modification of surface superconductivity by the topological surface states. The possibility of detecting signatures of the surface states using macroscopic magnetization provides a new tool for the discovery and identification of topological superconductors.

         <title>Homogeneous Carbon/Potassium&#8208;Incorporation Strategy for Synthesizing Red Polymeric Carbon Nitride Capable of Near&#8208;Infrared Photocatalytic H2 Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solid&#8208;salt&#8208;induced homogeneous incorporation strategy realizes red carbon/potassium&#8208;incorporated polymeric carbon nitride, which exhibits highly efficient H2 evolution from water and in situ hydrogen gas (drug&#8208;free) cancer therapy excited by near&#8208;infrared light.








Abstract
The efficient utilization of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light for photocatalytic hydrogen generation is vitally important to both solar hydrogen energy and hydrogen medicine, but remains a challenge at present, owing to the strict requirement of the semiconductor for high NIR responsiveness, narrow bandgap, and suitable redox potentials. Here, an NIR&#8208;active carbon/potassium&#8208;doped red polymeric carbon nitride (RPCN) is achieved for by using a similar&#8208;structure dopant as the melamine (C3H6N6) precursor with the solid KCl. The homogeneous and high incorporation of carbon and potassium remarkably narrows the bandgap of carbon nitride (1.7&#160;eV) and endows RPCN with a high NIR&#8208;photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution from water at the rate of 140 &#181;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 under NIR irradiation (700 nm &#8804; &#955;&#160;&#8804; 780&#160;nm), and the apparent quantum efficiency is high as 0.84% at 700 &#177; 10&#160;nm (and 13% at 500 &#177; 10&#160;nm). A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment on a tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model verifies RPCN as being capable of intratumoral NIR&#8208;photocatalytic hydrogen generation and simultaneous glutathione deprivation for safe and high&#8208;efficacy drug&#8208;free cancer therapy. The results shed light on designing efficient photocatalysts to capture the full spectrum of solar energy, and also pioneer a new pathway to develop NIR photocatalysts for hydrogen therapy of major diseases.

         <title>Engineering Endogenous Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophage&#8208;Targeted Biomimetic Nano&#8208;RBC to Reprogram Tumor Immunosuppressive Microenvironment for Enhanced Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An endogenous tumor&#8208;associated macrophage (TAM)&#8208;targeted biomimetic nano red blood cell (nano&#8208;RBC) system is engineered via self&#8208;assembly of a hemoglobin&#8211;poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (Hb&#8211;PCL) conjugate for enhanced cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy. The doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;loaded nano&#8208;RBC (V(Hb)@DOX) can innately target to decrease the number of immunosuppressive TAMs. Moreover, the O2 released from nano&#8208;RBC relieves tumor hypoxia, which further reprograms the immunosuppressive state to stimulate antitumor responses. The synergistic chemo&#8208;immunotherapy effectively suppresses tumor growth, inhibits metastasis, and prevents autologous tumor recurrence.








Abstract
Immunotherapy has shown encouraging results in various cancers, but the response rates are relatively low due to the complex tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment (TIME). The presence of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) and tumor hypoxia correlates significantly with potent immunosuppressive activity. Here, a hemoglobin&#8211;poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (Hb&#8211;PCL) conjugate self&#8208;assembled biomimetic nano red blood cell (nano&#8208;RBC) system (V(Hb)) is engineered to deliver chemotherapeutic doxorubicin (DOX) and oxygen for reprogramming TIME. The Hb moiety of V(Hb)@DOX can bind to endogenous plasma haptoglobin (Hp) and specifically target the M2&#8208;type TAMs via the CD163 surface receptor, and effectively kill the cells. In addition, the O2 released by the Hb alleviates tumor hypoxia, which further augments the antitumor immune response by recruiting fewer M2&#8208;type macrophages. TAM&#8208;targeting depletion and hypoxia alleviation synergistically reprogram the TIME, which concurrently downregulate PD&#8208;L1 expression of tumor cells, decrease the levels of immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL&#8208;10 and TGF&#8208;&#946;, elevate the immunostimulatory IFN&#8208;&#947;, enhance cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response, and boost a strong memory response. The ensuing TAM&#8208;targeted chemo&#8208;immunotherapeutic effects markedly inhibit tumor metastasis and recurrence. Taken together, the engineered endogenous TAM&#8208;targeted biomimetic nano&#8208;RBC system is a highly promising tool to reprogram TIME for cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.

&lt;p&gt;An endogenous tumor-associated macrophage (TAM)-targeted biomimetic nano red blood cell (nano-RBC) system is engineered via self-assembly of a hemoglobin&#8211;poly(&#949;-caprolactone) (Hb&#8211;PCL) conjugate for enhanced cancer chemo-immunotherapy. The doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded nano-RBC (V(Hb)@DOX) can innately target to decrease the number of immunosuppressive TAMs. Moreover, the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; released from nano-RBC relieves tumor hypoxia, which further reprograms the immunosuppressive state to stimulate antitumor responses. The synergistic chemo-immunotherapy effectively suppresses tumor growth, inhibits metastasis, and prevents autologous tumor recurrence.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Atomic Layers of Transition&#8208;Metal Carbides (MXenes)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy atomic layers of transition&#8208;metal carbide (HE&#8208;MXene) are produced via selectively etching a high&#8208;entropy MAX phase, in which five transition&#8208;metal species are homogeneously dispersed into one MX slab, giving rise to stable transition&#8208;metal carbide in the atomic layers. The resultant HE&#8208;MXene has distinct lattice distortions and strains, efficiently guiding the nucleation and uniform growth of lithium.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs) have great potential for energy storage and conversion due to their diverse compositions, and unexpected physical and chemical features. However, high&#8208;entropy atomic layers with fully exposed active sites are difficult to synthesize since their phases are easily segregated. Here, it is demonstrated that high&#8208;entropy atomic layers of transition&#8208;metal carbide (HE&#8208;MXene) can be produced via the selective etching of novel high&#8208;entropy MAX (also termed Mn+1AXn (n&#160;= 1, 2, 3), where M represents an early transition&#8208;metal element, A is an element mainly from groups 13&#8211;16, and X stands for C and/or N) phase (HE&#8208;MAX) (Ti1/5V1/5Zr1/5Nb1/5Ta1/5)2AlC, in which the five transition&#8208;metal species are homogeneously dispersed into one MX slab due to their solid&#8208;solution feature, giving rise to a stable transition&#8208;metal carbide in the atomic layers owing to the high molar configurational entropy and correspondingly low Gibbs free energy. Additionally, the resultant high&#8208;entropy MXene with distinct lattice distortions leads to high mechanical strain into the atomic layers. Moreover, the mechanical strain can efficiently guide the nucleation and uniform growth of dendrite&#8208;free lithium on HE&#8208;MXene, achieving a long cycling stability of up to 1200 h and good deep stripping&#8211;plating levels of up to 20 mAh cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Wavelength&#8208;Selective Softening of Hydrogel Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly selective photochemical behavior of three chromophores with distinct degradation wavelengths is exploited for the construction of selectively degradable hydrogels. Specifically, hydrogel softening can be achieved in a stepwise fashion according to the chromophores&#8217; activation wavelength, enabling fine control over the hydrogel's mechanical properties.








Abstract
Photoresponsive hydrogels hold key potential in advanced biomedical applications including tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and drug delivery, as well as intricately engineered functions such as biosensing, soft robotics, and bioelectronics. Herein, the wavelength&#8208;dependent degradation of bio&#8208;orthogonal poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogels is reported, using three selective activation levels. Specifically, three chromophores are exploited, that is, ortho&#8208;nitrobenzene, dimethyl aminobenzene, and bimane, each absorbing light at different wavelengths. By examining their photochemical action plots, the wavelength&#8208;dependent reactivity of the photocleavable moieties is determined. The wavelength&#8208;selective addressability of individual photoreactive units is subsequently translated into hydrogel design, enabling wavelength&#8208;dependent cleavage of the hydrogel networks on&#8208;demand. Critically, this platform technology allows for the fabrication of various hydrogels, whose mechanical properties can be fine&#8208;tuned using different colors of light to reach a predefined value, according to the chromophore ratios used. The softening is shown to influence the spreading of pre&#8208;osteoblastic cells adhering to the gels as a demonstration of their potential utility. Furthermore, the materials and photodegradation processes are non&#8208;toxic to cells, making this platform attractive for biomaterials engineering.

Chiral Photonic Polymers
In article number 2103309, Albertus P. H. J. Schenning, Michael G. Debije, and co&#8208;workers show that using direct ink writing, unconventional chiral nematic objects can be generated, which show a bright iridescent color from normal incidence, or only from sharp angles of observation depending on the writing speed. The cover is a polarized optical microscopy image showing a detail from the free&#8208;standing Morpho&#8208;inspired print.

MXenes
In article number 2103393, Michael Naguib,  Michel W. Barsoum, and Yury Gogotsi present a brief historical overview of the first 10 years of MXene research and a perspective on their synthesis and future development. The cover shows a colored SEM image of a multilayer Ti3C2 MXene particle with an accordion&#8208;like morphology, which is produced by individual MXene layers stacked together. The variety of colors represents the diversity of MXene structures and compositions. Image Credit: The SEM image was taken by Dr. Tyler Mathis and colored by Dr. Armin VahidMohammadi.

Cancer Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy
In article number 2103497, Yubin Huang, Dongfang Zhou, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate an engineered endogenous tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs)&#8208;targeting biomimetic nano&#8208;red&#8208;blood&#8208;cell (RBC) system to deliver chemotherapeutic doxorubicin and oxygen for enhanced cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy. TAMs&#8208;targeting depletion and hypoxia alleviation synergistically reprogram the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. The ensuing TAMs&#8208;targeted chemo&#8208;immunotherapeutic effects markedly inhibit tumor metastasis and recurrence.

Supramolecular Electronic Crystals
The cooperative tuning of a supramolecular electronic crystal enables access to a long&#8208;lived hidden conducting phase with a broad temperature range from 2 to 360 K, through a pulsed electromagnetic field. In article number 2103000, Shenqiang Ren and co&#8208;workers demonstrate a a dynamic and cooperative phase in K&#8208;TCNQ, with the control of pulsed electromagnetic excitation. A dedicated charge&#8211;spin&#8211;lattice decoupling is required to activate and subsequently stabilize the non&#8208;equilibrium phase.

         <title>Advances in the Synthesis of 2D MXenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent progress of MXenes synthesis strategies, including etching, intercalation, and delamination, is summarized. The large&#8208;scale preparation methods for MXenes and their derivates, such as flexible membranes and fibers, are discussed. Moreover, the understanding of the oxidation stability of MXenes and stable storage strategies are also addressed.








Abstract
2D transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides, also known as MXenes, are versatile materials due to their adjustable structure and rich surface chemistry. The physical and chemical diversity has recognized MXenes as a potential 2D material with a wide spectrum of application domains. Since the discovery of MXenes in 2011, a wide variety of synthetic routes has been proposed with advancement toward large&#8208;scale preparing methods for MXene nanosheets and derivative products. Herein, the critical synthesis aspects and the operating conditions that influence the physical and chemical characteristics of MXenes are discussed in detail. The emerging etching methods including HF etching methods, in situ HF&#8208;forming etching methods, electrochemical etching methods, alkali etching methods, and molten salt etching methods, as well as delamination strategies are discussed. Considering the future developments and practical applications, the large&#8208;scale synthesis routes and the antioxidation strategies of MXenes are also summarized. In summary, a generalized overview of MXenes synthesis protocols with an outlook for the current challenges and promising technologies for large&#8208;scale preparation and stable storage is provided.

         <title>Materials and Schemes of Multimodal Reconfigurable Micro/Nanomachines and Robots: Review and Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art micro/nanomaterials and schemes for multimodal reconfigurable micro/nanomachines, their dynamic assemblies, and swarming/collective behaviors are reviewed. Potential new materials and working principles are discussed along with their challenges and perspectives.








Abstract
Mechanically programmable, reconfigurable micro/nanoscale materials that can dynamically change their mechanical properties or behaviors, or morph into distinct assemblies or swarms in response to stimuli have greatly piqued the interest of the science community due to their unprecedented potentials in both fundamental research and technological applications. To date, a variety of designs of hard and soft materials, as well as actuation schemes based on mechanisms including chemical reactions and magnetic, acoustic, optical, and electric stimuli, have been reported. Herein, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art micro/nanostructures and operation schemes for multimodal reconfigurable micro/nanomachines and swarms, as well as potential new materials and working principles, challenges, and future perspectives are discussed.

         <title>Rational Design of Immunomodulatory Hydrogels for Chronic Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quality and duration of the healing process can be regulated via modulation of immune responses to tissue injury. Specifically, controlling pro&#8208;inflammatory phenotype&#8211;anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype progression is a crucial step to ensure a conversion from the inflammatory to the healing stage. In this regard, immunomodulatory hydrogels with specific chemistry and surface properties can influence immune cell polarization and the chronic wound healing process.








Abstract
With all the advances in tissue engineering for construction of fully functional skin tissue, complete regeneration of chronic wounds is still challenging. Since immune reaction to the tissue damage is critical in regulating both the quality and duration of chronic wound healing cascade, strategies to modulate the immune system are of importance. Generally, in response to an injury, macrophages switch from pro&#8208;inflammatory to an anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype. Therefore, controlling macrophages&#8217; polarization has become an appealing approach in regenerative medicine. Recently, hydrogels&#8208;based constructs, incorporated with various cellular and molecular signals, have been developed and utilized to adjust immune cell functions in various stages of wound healing. Here, the current state of knowledge on immune cell functions during skin tissue regeneration is first discussed. Recent advanced technologies used to design immunomodulatory hydrogels for controlling macrophages&#8217; polarization are then summarized. Rational design of hydrogels for providing controlled immune stimulation via hydrogel chemistry and surface modification, as well as incorporation of cell and molecules, are also dicussed. In addition, the effects of hydrogels&#8217; properties on immunogenic features and the wound healing process are summarized. Finally, future directions and upcoming research strategies to control immune responses during chronic wound healing are highlighted.
