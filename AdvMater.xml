Abstract
Hydrogels with high mechanical strength and injectability have attracted extensive attention in the field of biomedical tissue engineering. However, endowing a hydrogel with both properties is challenging because they are generally inversely related. In this work, by constructing a multi&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;bonding system, a high&#8208;strength and injectable supramolecular hydrogel was successfully fabricated, which was self&#8208;assembled in a single step using a monomeric nucleoside molecular gelator (2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosine, 2&#8208;FA) and distilled water (dH2O)/phosphate buffered saline (PBS) as the solvent. Its storage modulus reached 1&#160;MPa at a concentration of 5.0 wt%, which is the largest reported for a supramolecular hydrogel including an ultra&#8208;low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (MW&lt;300) gelator. Furthermore, it exhibited excellent shear&#8208;thinning injectability, converting from a liquid to a gel state in seconds after injection at 37&#176;C. Crystal structural analogy analysis and molecular dynamics simulation revealed that the multi&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;bonding system was essentially based on the synergistic interactions between the double NH2 groups, water molecules, and 2&#8217;&#8208;F atoms. Furthermore, the 2&#8208;FA hydrogel also exhibited excellent biocompatibility and antibacterial activity, indicating its suitability for application in tooth&#8208;extraction wounds. The in vivo animal experiments showed that the 2&#8208;FA hydrogel showed better socket healing performance after molar extraction in rats, compared to natural healing and the commercial hemorrhage agent gelatin sponge. Furthermore, it exhibited faster degradation and induced less osteoclastic activity and inflammatory infiltration, resulting in more complete bone healing. In summary, this study proposed a comprehensive strategy for developing a multifunctional, high&#8208;strength, and injectable supramolecular hydrogel for various biomedical engineering applications.

In this work, by constructing a multi-hydrogen-bonding system, a high-strength and injectable supramolecular hydrogel was successfully fabricated, which was self-assembled in a single step using a monomeric nucleoside molecular gelator (2-amino-2&#8217;-fluoro-2&#8217;-deoxyadenosine, 2-FA) and distilled water (dH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)/phosphate buffered saline (PBS) as the solvent. Its storage modulus reached 1&#160;MPa at a concentration of 5.0 wt%, which is the largest reported for a supramolecular hydrogel including an ultra-low-molecular-weight (MW&amp;lt;300) gelator.

         <title>Cascade&#8208;targeting Poly(amino acid) Nanoparticles Eliminate Intracellular Bacteria via on&#8208;site Antibiotic Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Intracellular bacteria in latent or dormant states tolerate high&#8208;dose antibiotics. Fighting against these opportunistic bacteria has been a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, we design a cascade&#8208;targeting drug delivery system (DDS) that can sequentially target macrophages and intracellular bacteria, exhibiting on&#8208;site drug delivery. The DDS is fabricated by encapsulating rifampicin (Rif) into mannose&#8208;decorated poly(&#945;&#8208;N&#8208;acryloyl&#8208;phenylalanine)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(&#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acryloyl&#8208;D&#8208;aminoalanine) nanoparticles, denoted as Rif@FAM NPs. The mannose units on Rif@FAM NPs guide the initial macrophage&#8208;specific uptake and intracellular accumulation. After the uptake, the detachment of mannose in acidic phagolysosome via Schiff base cleavage exposes the D&#8208;aminoalanine moieties, which subsequently steer the NPs to escape from lysosomes and target intracellular bacteria through peptidoglycan&#8208;specific binding, as evidenced by the in&#8208;situ/ex&#8208;situ co&#8208;localization using confocal, flow cytometry, and TEM. Through the on&#8208;site Rif delivery, Rif@FAM NPs show superior in vitro and in vivo elimination efficiency than the control groups of free Rif or the DDSs lacking the macrophages&#8208; or bacteria&#8208;targeting moieties. Furthermore, Rif@FAM NPs remodel the innate immune response of the infected macrophages by up&#8208;regulating the M1/M2 polarization, resulting in a reinforced antibacterial capacity. Therefore, this biocompatible DDS enabling macrophages and bacteria targeting in a cascade manner provides a new outlook for the therapy of intracellular pathogen infection.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Liquid Crystal Printheads for Spatial and Temporal Control of Polymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polymerization reactions triggered by stimuli play a pivotal role in material science, with applications ranging from lithography to biomedicine to adaptive materials. However, the development of chemically&#8208;triggered, stimuli&#8208;responsive systems that can confer spatial and temporal control on polymerization remains a challenge. Herein, chemical stimuli&#8208;induced polymerization based on a liquid crystal (LC) printhead is presented. The LC responds to a local chemical stimulus at its aqueous interface, resulting in the ejection of initiator into solution to trigger polymerization. Various LC printhead geometries are designed, allowing programming of (i) bulk solution polymerization, (ii) synthesis of a thin surface&#8208;confined polymeric coating, (iii) polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers to form various nanostructures (sphere, worm&#8208;like and vesicles), and (iv) three&#8208;dimensional (3D) polymeric structures printed according to local solution conditions. The approach is demonstrated using amphiphiles, multivalent ions and biomolecules as stimuli.

         <title>Multilayer Reservoir Computing Based on Ferroelectric &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 for Hierarchical Information Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Dynamic physical systems such as reservoir computing (RC) architectures have shown great prospect in temporal information processing, whereas hierarchical information processing capability is still lacking due to the absence of advanced multilayer reservoir elements. Here, a stackable reservoir system is constructed based on ferroelectric &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 devices with voltage input and output, which is realized by dynamic voltage division between a ferroelectric field effect transistor and a planar device and therefore allows the reservoirs to cascade, enabling multilayer reservoir computing. Fast Fourier transformation analysis shows high harmonic generation in the first layer as a result of inherent nonlinearity of the reservoir, and progressive low&#8208;pass filtering effect was realized where higher&#8208;frequency components are progressively filtered in deeper&#8208;layer RCs. Time series prediction and waveform classification tasks have also been demonstrated, serving as evidence for the memory capacity and computing capability of the deep reservoir architecture. This work could provide a promising pathway in exploiting emerging 2D materials and dynamics for advanced neuromorphic computing architectures.

         <title>Biomimetic Human lung&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip with Colorful Displaying Microphysiological Breath</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Lung&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip models hold great promise for disease modeling and drug screening in the past decade. Herein, inspired by the iridescence phenomenon of soap bubbles, we present a novel biomimetic 3D microphysiological lung&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip system with breathing visuality. The system with an array of pulmonary alveoli at the physiological scale was constructed and coated with structural color materials. Cyclic deformation was induced by regular airflow, resembling the expansion and contraction of the alveoli during the rhythmic breathing. As the deformation were accompanied with corresponding synchronous shifts in the structural colors, the constructed system offered the self&#8208;reporting of cell mechanics and enabled real&#8208;time monitoring of the cultivation process. Using this system, we have investigated the dynamic relationships between color atlas and disease symptoms, showing the essential role of mechanical stretch in the phenotypes of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. These features make this human lung system ideal in biological study, disease monitoring and drug discovery.

         <title>Jammed Micro&#8208;Flake Hydrogel for 4D Living Cell Bioprinting</title>

Abstract
Four&#8208;dimensional (4D) bioprinting is promising to build cell&#8208;laden constructs (bioconstructs) with complex geometries and functions for tissue/organ regeneration applications. The development of hydrogel&#8208;based 4D bioinks, especially those allowing living cell printing, with easy preparation, defined composition, and controlled physical properties is critically important for 4D bioprinting. Here, a single&#8208;component jammed micro&#8208;flake hydrogel (MFH) system with heterogeneous size distribution, which differs from the conventional granular microgel, has been developed as a new cell&#8208;laden bioink for 4D bioprinting. This jammed cytocompatible MFH features scalable production and straightforward composition with shear&#8208;thinning, shear&#8208;yielding, and rapid self&#8208;healing properties. As such, it can be smoothly printed into stable 3D bioconstructs, which can be further crosslinked to form a gradient in crosslinking density when a photoinitiator and a UV absorber are incorporated. After being subject to shape morphing, a variety of complex bioconstructs with well&#8208;defined configurations and high cell viability were obtained. Based on this system, 4D cartilage&#8208;like tissue formation was demonstrated as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept. The establishment of this versatile new 4D bioink system may open up a number of applications in tissue engineering.

         <title>Biomimetic Nanoerythrosome&#8208;Coated Aptamer&#8208;DNA Tetrahedron/Maytansine Conjugates: pH&#8208;Responsive and Targeted Cytotoxicity for HER2&#8208;positive Breast Cancer</title>

Abstract
DNA materials have emerged as potential nanocarriers for targeted cancer therapy with superior biological applications to precisely deliver cargo with specific purpose. However, many DNA carriers have constrained ability to carry sufficient dose of drugs, and their short half&#8208;life and low bioavailability due to the interception by the reticuloendothelial system and blood clearance further limit their clinical translations. To address these issues, our study employed a HER2&#8208;targeted DNA aptamer modified tetrahedral framework nucleic acid (HApt&#8208;tFNA) as a drug delivery system, and combined maytansine (DM1) and HApt&#8208;tFNA to develop the HApt&#8208;DNA tetrahedron/DM1 conjugate (HApt&#8208;tFNA@DM1, HTD, HApDC) nanomedicine for targeted therapy of HER2&#8208;positive cancer. To optimize the pharmacokinetics and tumor&#8208;aggregation of HTD, a biomimetic camouflage was applied to embed HTD. The biomimetic camouflage was constructed by merging the red blood cell (RBC) membrane with pH&#8208;responsive functionalized synthetic liposomes thus with excellent performance of chemotherapeutic drug delivery and tumor&#8208;stimulated drug release. In xenograft mice models, the hybrid erythrosome&#8208;based nanoparticles showed better inhibition of HER2&#8208;positive cancer than other drug formulations. More importantly, not like other therapeutics, this novel nanomedicine exhibited superior biosafety and did not induce any overt side effects. With the strengths of precise delivery, increased drug loading, more sensitive tumor probing and prolonged circulation time to exert long&#8208;lasting anti&#8208;tumor effects, the HApDC represents a promising nanomedicine to treat HER2&#8208;positive tumors. Notably, this study is the first to develop a dual&#8208;targeting nanoparticle by combining pH&#8208;sensitive biomimetic camouflage and HApDC, initiating an important step towards the developments and applications of DNA&#8208;based medicine and biomimetic cell membrane materials in cancer treatment and other potential biological applications in the future.

         <title>Machine Learning Guided Synthesis of Flash Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Advances in nanoscience have enabled the synthesis of nanomaterials, such as graphene, from low&#8208;value or waste materials through flash Joule heating. Though this capability is promising, the complex and entangled variables that govern nanocrystal formation in the Joule heating process remain poorly understood. In this work, we construct machine learning (ML) models to explore the factors that drive the transformation of amorphous carbon into graphene nanocrystals during flash Joule heating. An XGBoost regression model of crystallinity achieves an r2 score of 0.8051 &#177; 0.054. Feature importance assays and decision trees extracted from these models reveal key considerations in the selection of starting materials and the role of stochastic current fluctuations in flash Joule heating synthesis. Furthermore, partial dependence analyses demonstrate the importance of charge and current density as predictors of crystallinity, implying a progression from reaction&#8208;limited to diffusion&#8208;limited kinetics as flash Joule heating parameters change. Finally, we show a practical application of the ML models by using Bayesian meta&#8208;learning algorithms to automatically improve bulk crystallinity over many Joule heating reactions. These results illustrate the power of ML as a tool to analyze complex nanomanufacturing processes and enable the synthesis of 2D crystals with desirable properties by flash Joule heating.

         <title>Electrostatically Driven Polarization Flop and strain&#8208;induced Curvature in free&#8208;standing Ferroelectric Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The combination of strain and electrostatic engineering in epitaxial heterostructures of ferroelectric oxides offers many possibilities for inducing new phases, complex polar topologies, and enhanced electrical properties. However, the dominant effect of substrate clamping can also limit the electromechanical response and often leaves electrostatics to play a secondary role. Releasing the mechanical constraint imposed by the substrate can not only dramatically alter the balance between elastic and electrostatic forces, enabling them to compete on par with each other, but also activate new mechanical degrees of freedom, such as the macroscopic curvature of the heterostructure. In this work, an electrostatically driven transition from a predominantly out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarized to an in&#8208;plane polarized state is observed when a PbTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattice with a SrRuO3 bottom electrode is released from its substrate. In turn, this polarization rotation modifies the lattice parameter mismatch between the superlattice and the thin SrRuO3 layer, causing the heterostructure to curl up into microtubes. Through a combination of synchrotron&#8208;based scanning X&#8208;ray diffraction imaging, Raman scattering, piezoresponse force microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy, the crystalline structure and domain patterns of the curved superlattices are investigated, revealing a strong anisotropy in the domain structure and a complex mechanism for strain accommodation.

         <title>Theory of Chirality Induced Spin Selectivity: Progress and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We&#160;provide a critical overview of the theory of the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, i.e., phenomena in which the chirality of molecular species imparts significant spin selectivity to various electron processes. Based on discussions in a recently held workshop, and further work published since, we&#160;review the status of CISS effects &#8208; in electron transmission, electron transport, and chemical reactions. For each, we&#160;provide a detailed discussion of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in theoretical understanding and identify remaining challenges and research opportunities.

         <title>Highly Efficient Cellular Acoustic Absorber of Graphene Ultrathin Drums</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Atomically thin two&#8208;dimensional graphene sheet exhibits unparalleled in&#8208;plane stiffness and large out&#8208;of&#8208;plane elasticity, thereby provides strong mechanical resonance for nanomechanical devices. The exceptional resonance behavior of ultrathin graphene promises to the fabrication of superior acoustic absorption materials, however, remains unfulfilled for the lack of applicable form and assembly methods. Here, we present a highly efficient acoustic absorber by constructing cellular networks of ultrathin graphene membranes into polymer foams. The ultrathin graphene drums exhibit strong resonances and efficiently dissipate sound waves in a broad frequency range. The record specific noise reduction coefficient (51.3 at 30&#160;mm) is achieved in our graphene&#8208;based acoustic absorber, fully realizing the superior resonance properties of graphene sheets. Our scalable method facilely transforms commercial polymer foams to superior acoustic absorber with a &#8764;320% enhancement in average absorption coefficient across wide frequencies from 200 to 6000&#160;Hz. The graphene acoustic absorber offers a convenient method to exploit the extraordinary resonance properties of 2D sheets, opening extensive new applications in noise protection, building design, instruments and acoustic devices.

         <title>Electrical Tuning of Plasmonic Conducting Polymer Nanoantennas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanostructures of conventional metals offer manipulation of light at the nanoscale but are largely limited to static behavior due to fixed material properties. To develop the next frontier of dynamic nanooptics and metasurfaces, we utilize the redox&#8208;tunable optical properties of conducting polymers, as recently shown capable of sustaining plasmons in their most conducting oxidized state. Using nanodisks of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene:sulfate) (PEDOT:Sulf) as a model system, we here present electrically tunable conducting polymer nanooptical antennas. In addition to repeated on/off switching of the polymeric nanoantennas, we demonstrate gradual electrical tuning of their nanooptical response, which was found related to the modulation of both density and mobility of the mobile polaronic charge carriers in the polymer. The presented concept takes important steps towards electrically tunable metasurfaces, with not tunable farfield as well as nearfield. The work paves the way for applications ranging from tunable flat metaoptics to adaptable smart windows.

         <title>A Ferrotoroidic Candidate with Well&#8208;separated Spin Chains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The search of novel quasi one&#8208;dimensional (1D) materials is one of the important aspects in the field of material science. Toroidal moment, the order parameter of ferrotoroidic order, can be generated by a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail configuration of magnetic moment. It has been theoretically proposed that one&#8208;dimensional (1D) dimerized and antiferromagnetic&#8208;like spin chain hosts ferrotoroidicity and has the toroidal moment composed of only two antiparallel spins. Here, we report a ferrotoroidic candidate of Ba6Cr2S10 with such a theoretical model of spin chain. The structure consists of unique dimerized face&#8208;sharing CrS6 octahedral chains along the c axis. An antiferromagnetic&#8208;like ordering at &#8764;10 K breaks both space&#8208; and time&#8208;reversal symmetries and the magnetic point group of mm&#8220;2&#8221; allows three ferroic orders in Ba6Cr2S10: (anti)ferromagnetic, ferroelectric and ferrotoroidic orders. Our investigation reveals that Ba6Cr2S10 is a rare ferrotoroidic candidate with quasi 1D spin chain, which can be considered as a starting point for the further exploration of the physics and applications of ferrotoroidicity.

         <title>Ultrasensitive and Robust 120&#160;keV Hard X&#8208;ray Imaging Detector Based on Mixed&#8208;Halide Perovskite CsPbBr3&#8722;nIn Single Crystals</title>

Abstract
The relatively low resistivity and severe ion migration in inorganic perovskite CsPbBr3 significantly degrade the performance of X&#8208;ray detectors due to their high detection limit and current drift. We investigate the electrical properties and X&#8208;ray detection performances of CsPbBr3&#8208;nIn single crystals by doping the iodine atoms into the melt&#8208;grown CsPbBr3 crystals. The resistivity of CsPbBr3&#8208;nIn single crystals increases from 3.6 &#215; 109 (CsPbBr3) to 2.2 &#215; 1011 (CsPbBr2I) &#937;&#183;cm as the iodine content increases, restraining the leak current and decreasing the detection limit of the detector. Additionally, CsPbBr3&#8208;nIn single crystals exhibit stable dark currents under an electric field of 5000&#160;V cm&#8211;1, arising from their high ion migration activation energy. A record sensitivity of 6.3 &#215; 104 &#956;C Gy&#8211;1&#160;cm&#8211;2 (CsPbBr2.9I0.1) and a low detection limit of 54 nGy s&#8211;1 (CsPbBr2I) are achieved by CsPbBr3&#8208;nIn single crystals for the 120&#160;keV hard X&#8208;ray detection under a 5000&#160;V cm&#8211;1 electrical field. The CsPbBr2.9I0.1 detector shows a stable current response with a dark current density of 0.58 &#956;A cm&#8211;2 for 30 days and clear imaging for 120&#160;keV X&#8208;rays at ambient conditions. The effective iodine atom doping strategy and the high quality make the CsPbBr3&#8208;nIn SCs single crystals promising for reproducible high&#8208;energy hard X&#8208;ray imaging systems.

         <title>Application of Nanostructured TiO2 in UV Photodetectors: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
As a wide bandgap inorganic semiconductor material, the titanium dioxide (TiO2) which possesses 3 crystal polymorphs (i.e., rutile, anatase and brookite), has gained tremendous attention as a cutting&#8208;edge material for the application in&#160;environment and energy field. Based on the strong attractiveness from its advantages such as high stability, excellent photoelectric properties and low&#8208;cost fabrication, the construction of high&#8208;performance photodetectors (PDs) based on TiO2 nanostructures is being extensively developed. An elaborate microtopography and device configuration is the most widely used strategy to achieve efficient TiO2&#8208;based PDs with high photoelectric performances, however, a deep understanding of all the key parameters that influence the behavior of photon&#8208;generated carriers, is also highly required to achieve improved photoelectric performances as well as their ultimate functional applications. In this review, we present an in&#8208;depth illustration of the electrical and optical properties of TiO2 nanostructures in addition to the advances in the technological issues such as preparation, micro&#8208;defects, p&#8208;type doping, band&#8208;gap engineering, heterojunctions, and functional applications. Finally, we provide future outlooks for the TiO2&#8208;based photoelectric devices, particularly that of further functional applications. This work will systematically illustrate the fundamentals of TiO2 and shed light on the preparation of more efficient TiO2 nanostructures and heterojunctions for the future photoelectric applications.

         <title>Asymmetric Chemical Functionalization of Top&#8208;Contact Electrodes: Tuning the Charge Injection for High Performance MoS2 Field&#8208;Effect Transistors and Schottky Diodes</title>

Abstract
The fabrication of high&#8208;performance (opto&#8208;)electronic devices based on ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional channel materials requires the optimization of the charge injection at the electrode &#8211; semiconductor interface. While the chemical functionalization with chemisorbed self&#8208;assembled monolayers has been extensively exploited to adjust the work function of metallic electrodes in bottom&#8208;contact devices, such a strategy was never demonstrated when the top&#8208;contact configuration is chosen, despite the latter is known to offer enhanced charge injection characteristics. Here, we have developed a novel contact engineering method to functionalize gold electrodes in top&#8208;contact field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs), via the transfer of chemically pre&#8208;modified electrodes. The source and drain electrodes of the molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) FETs were functionalized with prototypical thiolated molecules possessing by design different dipole moments. While the modification of the Au electrode with electron&#8208;donating molecules yielded a marked improvement of the device performance, the asymmetric functionalization of the source and drain electrodes with two different chemisorbed molecules with opposed dipole moment enabled the fabrication of a high&#8208;performance Schottky diodes with a rectification ratio of &#8764;103. Our unprecedented strategy to tune the charge injection and extraction in in top&#8208;contact MoS2 FETs is of general applicability for the fabrication of high&#8208;performance opto&#8208;electronic devices based on 2D semiconductors in which the energetic asymmetry is required to boost the device functionality (e.g., for light&#8208;emitting transistors, solar cells, etc), enabling to tailor the device characteristics on&#8208;demand.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of 2D Nanomaterial Field&#8208;Effect Transistor Sensors: Fundamentals and Translation across the Innovation Spectrum</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D nanomaterials are analyzed fundamentally for their field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) and tunneling FET (TFET) sensor applications. With molecular engineering of specific probes, they hold great potential for intelligent management of water by detecting water contaminants with both high sensitivity and high selectivity. Major challenges and opportunities for designing and fabricating 2D nanomaterial FET/TFET sensors with superior performance are also outlined.








Abstract
Over the last decade, 2D layered nanomaterials have attracted significant attention across the scientific community due to their rich and exotic properties. Various nanoelectronic devices based on these 2D nanomaterials have been explored and demonstrated, including those for environmental applications. Here, the fundamental attributes of 2D layered nanomaterials for field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) sensors and tunneling FET (TFET) sensors, which provide versatile detection of water contaminants such as heavy&#8208;metal ions, bacteria, nutrients, and organic pollutants, are discussed. The major challenges and opportunities are also outlined for designing and fabricating 2D nanomaterial FET/TFET sensors with superior performance. Translation of these FET/TFET sensors from fundamental research to applied technology is illustrated through a case study on graphene&#8208;based real&#8208;time FET water sensors. A second case study centers on large&#8208;scale sensor networks for water&#8208;quality monitoring to enable intelligent drinking water and river&#8208;water systems. Overall, 2D nanomaterial FET sensors have significant potential for enabling a human&#8208;centered intelligent water system that can likely be applied to other precarious water supplies around the globe.

         <title>Deterministic Shallow Dopant Implantation in Silicon with Detection Confidence Upper&#8208;Bound to 99.85% by Ion&#8211;Solid Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;chip electrodes are employed to signal near&#8208;surface single&#8208;ion implantation in silicon. A physical model of the signals provides insights into the ion stopping trajectories within the silicon chip and reveals greater than 99.8% single&#8208;ion&#8208;detection confidence. The study demonstrates the feasibility of controlled scalable dopant architecture engineering for classical and quantum silicon devices.








Abstract
Silicon chips containing arrays of single dopant atoms can be the material of choice for classical and quantum devices that exploit single donor spins. For example, group&#8208;V donors implanted in isotopically purified 28Si crystals are attractive for large&#8208;scale quantum computers. Useful attributes include long nuclear and electron spin lifetimes of 31P, hyperfine clock transitions in 209Bi or electrically controllable 123Sb nuclear spins. Promising architectures require the ability to fabricate arrays of individual near&#8208;surface dopant atoms with high yield. Here, an on&#8208;chip detector electrode system with 70&#160;eV root&#8208;mean&#8208;square noise (&#8776;20 electrons) is employed to demonstrate near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature implantation of single 14&#160;keV 31P+ ions. The physics model for the ion&#8211;solid interaction shows an unprecedented upper&#8208;bound single&#8208;ion&#8208;detection confidence of 99.85 &#177; 0.02% for near&#8208;surface implants. As a result, the practical controlled silicon doping yield is limited by materials engineering factors including surface gate oxides in which detected ions may stop. For a device with 6&#160;nm gate oxide and 14&#160;keV 31P+ implants, a yield limit of 98.1% is demonstrated. Thinner gate oxides allow this limit to converge to the upper&#8208;bound. Deterministic single&#8208;ion implantation can therefore be a viable materials engineering strategy for scalable dopant architectures in silicon devices.

         <title>Stapled Liposomes Enhance Cross&#8208;Priming of Radio&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An antigen&#8208;capturing stapled liposome (ACSL) with robust structure and bioactive surface that can capture and transport tumor&#8208;associated antigens (TAAs) from lysosomes to cytoplasm in dendritic cells, thereby enhancing the TAA cross&#8208;presentation for effective radio&#8208;immunotherapy is demonstrated.








Abstract
The release of tumor&#8208;associated antigens (TAAs) and their cross&#8208;presentation in dendritic cells (DCs) are crucial for radio&#8208;immunotherapy. However, the irradiation resistance of tumor cells usually results in limited TAA generation and release. Importantly, TAAs internalized by DCs are easily degraded in lysosomes, resulting in unsatisfactory extent of TAA cross&#8208;presentation. Herein, an antigen&#8208;capturing stapled liposome (ACSL) with a robust structure and bioactive surface is developed. The ACSLs capture and transport TAAs from lysosomes to the cytoplasm in DCs, thereby enhancing TAA cross&#8208;presentation. l&#8208;arginine encapsulated in ACSLs induces robust T cell&#8208;dependent antitumor response and immune memory in 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mice after local irradiation, resulting in significant tumor suppression and an abscopal effect. Replacing l&#8208;arginine with radiosensitizers, photosensitizers, and photothermal agents may make ACSL a universal platform for the rapid development of various combinations of anticancer therapies.

         <title>Deciphering Nanoparticle Trafficking into Glioblastomas Uncovers an Augmented Antitumor Effect of Metronomic Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The underlying fate of surface&#8208;modified lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles is directly observed in an intracranial glioblastoma xenograft model. An augmented antitumor effect is further validated directly on glioma cells from the metronomic chemotherapy administration using nanoparticles.








Abstract
Nanoparticles have been explored in glioblastomas as they can traverse the blood&#8211;brain barrier and target glioblastoma selectively. However, direct observation of nanoparticle trafficking into glioblastoma cells and their underlying intracellular fate after systemic administration remains uncharacterized. Here, based on high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy experiments of an intracranial glioblastoma model, it is shown that ligand&#8208;modified nanoparticles can traverse the blood&#8211;brain barrier, endocytose into the lysosomes of glioblastoma cells, and undergo endolysosomal escape upon photochemical ionization. Moreover, an optimal dose of metronomic chemotherapy using dual&#8208;drug&#8208;loaded nanocarriers can induce an augmented antitumor effect directly on tumors, which has not been recognized in previous studies. Metronomic chemotherapy enhances antitumor effects 3.5&#8208;fold compared with the standard chemotherapy regimen using the same accumulative dose in vivo.

&lt;p&gt;The underlying fate of surface-modified lanthanide-doped nanoparticles is directly observed in an intracranial glioblastoma xenograft model. An augmented antitumor effect is further validated directly on glioma cells from the metronomic chemotherapy administration using nanoparticles.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanoparticles have been explored in glioblastomas as they can traverse the blood&#8211;brain barrier and target glioblastoma selectively. However, direct observation of nanoparticle trafficking into glioblastoma cells and their underlying intracellular fate after systemic administration remains uncharacterized. Here, based on high-resolution transmission electron microscopy experiments of an intracranial glioblastoma model, it is shown that ligand-modified nanoparticles can traverse the blood&#8211;brain barrier, endocytose into the lysosomes of glioblastoma cells, and undergo endolysosomal escape upon photochemical ionization. Moreover, an optimal dose of metronomic chemotherapy using dual-drug-loaded nanocarriers can induce an augmented antitumor effect directly on tumors, which has not been recognized in previous studies. Metronomic chemotherapy enhances antitumor effects 3.5-fold compared with the standard chemotherapy regimen using the same accumulative dose in vivo. This study provides a conceptual framework that can be used to develop metronomic nanoparticle regimens as a safe and viable therapeutic strategy for treating glioblastomas and other advanced-stage solid tumors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioinspired Quasi&#8208;3D Multiplexed Anti&#8208;Counterfeit Imaging via Self&#8208;Assembled and Nanoimprinted Photonic Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite lattice photonic crystal architecture can realize polarization&#8208;sensitive multichannel image encodings designed by self&#8208;assembling and nanoimprinting technique. This strategy is low cost, high yield, and scalable, leading to innovative anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology with efficient and handy fabrication.








Abstract
Innovative multiplexing technologies based on nano&#8208;optics for anti&#8208;counterfeiting have been proposed as overt and covert technologies to secure products and make them difficult to counterfeit. However, most of these nano&#8208;optical anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials are metasurfaces and metamaterials with complex and expensive fabrication process, often resulting in materials that are not damage tolerant. Highly efficient anti&#8208;counterfeiting technologies with easy fabrication process are targeted for intuitive and effective authentication of banknotes, secure documents, and goods packing. Here, a simple strategy exploiting self&#8208;assembling and nanoimprinting technique to fabricate a composite lattice photonic crystal architecture featuring full spatial control of light, multiplexed full&#8208;pixel imaging, and multichannel cryptography combined with customized algorithms is reported. In particular, the real&#8208;time encryption/recognition of mobile quick response codes and anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels on a postage stamp, encoded by the proposed photonic architecture, are both demonstrated. The wave optics of scattering, diffraction, and polarization process involved are also described, validated with numerical simulations and experiments. By introducing a new degree of freedom in the 3D space, the multichannel image switching exhibits unprecedented variability of encryption, providing a promising roadmap to achieve larger information capacity, better security, and higher definition for the benefit of modern anti&#8208;counterfeiting security.

         <title>Fluidic Manipulating of Printable Zinc Oxide for Flexible Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using the optimized n&#8208;propylamine&#8211;zinc oxide electron transporting layer, an organic solar cell with high power conversion efficiency and outstanding stability is achieved.








Abstract
As a representative electron transporting layer in organic solar cells, zinc oxide (ZnO) can be fabricated by the meniscus&#8208;guided coating with the promotion of sol&#8211;gel technology. In order to fabricate stable and flexible organic solar cells (OSCs) based on the printable ZnO layers, here, a new method for simultaneously manipulating fluidics of the sol&#8211;gel ZnO precursor and optimizing processability of the ZnO layer for flexible OSCs is developed. It is found that the Marangoni recirculation in meniscus and the annealing temperature of the sol&#8211;gel ZnO precursor can be effectively modulated by changing the Lewis base. With the use of propylamine, the high&#8208;quality ZnO layer that is suitable for flexible OSCs can be fabricated through blade coating. Under such a condition, the formation of polar facet in ZnO layer is well restrained, which favors the photostability of the cells. As a result, the best 1.00 cm2 flexible cell outputs a power conversion efficiency of 16.71%, which is the best value till now.

         <title>Defective Bimetallic Selenides for Selective CO2 Electroreduction to CO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic CuInSe2 with Se vacanies (V&#8208;CuInSe2) significantly optimizes the adsorption of CO2 electroreduction intermediates owing to its moderate band center relative to the Fermi level. Meanwhile, hydrogen evolution is suppressed on V&#8208;CuInSe2 due to an energetically unfavorable surface reconstruction after hydrogen adsorption. Consequently, the V&#8208;CuInSe2 achieves a highly active and selective CO generation ability.








Abstract
CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) to CO is promising for the carbon cycle but still remains challenging. Au is regarded as the most selective catalyst for CO2RR, but its high cost significantly hinders its industrial application. Herein, the bimetallic CuInSe2 is found to exhibit an Au&#8208;like catalytic feature: i) the interaction of Cu and In orbitals induces a moderate adsorption strength of CO2RR intermediates and favors the reaction pathway; and ii) the hydrogen evolution is energetically unfavorable on CuInSe2, as a surface reconstruction along with high energy change will occur after hydrogen adsorption. Furthermore, the Se vacancy is found to induce an electron redistribution, slightly tune the band structure, and optimize the CO2RR route of bimetallic selenide. Consequently, the Se&#8208;defective CuInSe2 (V&#8208;CuInSe2) achieves a highly selective CO production ability that is comparable to noble metals in aqueous electrolyte, and the V&#8208;CuInSe2 cathode shows a satisfactory performance in an aqueous Zn&#8211;CO2 cell. This work demonstrates that designing cost&#8208;effective catalysts with noble&#8208;metal&#8208;like properties is an ideal strategy for developing efficient electrocatalysts. Moreover, the class of transition bimetallic selenides has shown promising prospects as active and cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts owing to their unique structural, electronic, and catalytic properties.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A membrane is fabricated by ionic crosslinking sulfonated poly(arylene ether ketone) and imidazolium&#8208;functionalized poly(arylene ether sulfone) to aggregate the ion pathways in the membrane through nanophase separation, which results in excellent ion selectivity and high ion conductivity. This membrane shows great potential in osmotic energy conversion, which maximum power density can be up to 16.72 W m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Charge&#8208;governed ion transport is crucial to numerous industries, and the advanced membrane is the essential component. In nature, the efficient and selective ion transport is mainly governed by the charged ion channels located in cell membrane, indicating the architecture with functional differentiation. Inspired by this architecture, a membrane by ionic crosslinking sulfonated poly(arylene ether ketone) and imidazolium&#8208;functionalized poly(arylene ether sulfone) is designed and fabricated to make full use of the charges. This ionic crosslinking is designed to realize nanophase separation to aggregate the ion pathways in the membrane, which results in excellent ion selectivity and high ion conductivity. With the excellent ion transport behavior, ionic crosslinking membrane shows great potential in osmotic energy conversion, which maximum power density can be up to 16.72 W m&#8722;2.

         <title>Selective Antisite Defect Formation in WS2 Monolayers via Reactive Growth on Dilute W&#8208;Au Alloy Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antisite defects in monolayer WS2 are selectively formed with a nonequilibrium synthesis strategy that can reduce their formation energy via W&#8208;poor growth conditions achieved by limiting the available surface W concentration on a W/Au alloy. A high density of SW and S2W antisite defects can be obtained and identified in monolayer WS2 that are sufficient to induce localized defect states in the bandgap.








Abstract
Defects are ubiquitous in 2D materials and can affect the structure and properties of the materials and also introduce new functionalities. Methods to adjust the structure and density of defects during bottom&#8208;up synthesis are required to control the growth of 2D materials with tailored optical and electronic properties. Here, the authors present an Au&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition approach to selectively form SW and S2W antisite defects, whereby one or two sulfur atoms substitute for a tungsten atom in WS2 monolayers. Guided by first&#8208;principles calculations, they describe a new method that can maintain tungsten&#8208;poor growth conditions relative to sulfur via the low solubility of W atoms in a gold/W alloy, thereby significantly reducing the formation energy of the antisite defects during the growth of WS2. The atomic structure and composition of the antisite defects are unambiguously identified by Z&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy, and their total concentration is statistically determined, with levels up to &#8776;5.0%. Scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy measurements and first&#8208;principles calculations further verified these antisite defects and revealed the localized defect states in the bandgap of WS2 monolayers. This bottom&#8208;up synthesis method to form antisite defects should apply in the synthesis of other 2D materials.

         <title>An Enzyme&#8208;Activatable Aggregation&#8208;Induced&#8208;Emission Probe: Intraoperative Pathological Fluorescent Diagnosis of Pancreatic Cancer via Specific Cathepsin E</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amphiphilic AIE&#8208;active probe is developed by integrating a biological penetration unit, a cell penetrating peptide, which realizes efficient cell&#8208;penetration ability, with in situ generation of high&#8208;fidelity AIE signals for long&#8208;term tracking of the endogenous overexpressed Cathepsin E enzyme in human PC cells, achieving the intraoperative pathological diagnosis of pancreatic cancer section, and succeeding in tracking xenograft&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing nude BALB/C mice.








Abstract
Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most devastating malignant tumors. However, fluorescence probes for early clinical diagnosis of PC often encounter difficulties in accuracy and penetrability. In this work, an enzyme&#8208;activated aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission (AIE) probe, QM&#8211;HSP&#8211;CPP, for high&#8208;contrast fluorescence diagnosis of PC is developed by monitoring specific overexpressed enzyme Cathepsin E (CTSE). The probe is composed of an AIE fluorophore QM&#8211;COOH (QM = quinoline&#8211;malononitrile), CTSE&#8208;triggered hydrophobic peptide (HSP), and hydrophilic biocompatible cell penetrating peptide (CPP). The CPP unit can well&#8208;modulate the molecular dispersion properties, giving initial fluorescence&#8208;off state in the aqueous biosystem, thus endowing high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, and finally overcoming the poor targeting selectivity of traditional AIE probes. CPP can ensure cell/tissue penetrating ability, thus allowing on&#8208;site monitoring of endogenous CTSE in PC cells, tissues, and living animal models. When the QM&#8211;HSP&#8211;CPP probe is specifically cleaved by CTSE, it can generate AIE signals in situ with high&#8208;specificity and long&#8208;term tracking ability, and successfully achieve intraoperative diagnosis of human PC sections, tracking PC in heterotopic nude mice models. The CTSE&#8208;enzyme&#8208;triggered AIEgens&#8217; liberation strategy improves accuracy and addresses the penetration problem simultaneously, which can expand the database of multitudinous biocompatible AIE&#8208;active probes, especially for establishing intraoperative pathological fluorescent diagnosis.

         <title>Ultrafast Synthesis of I&#8208;Rich Lithium Argyrodite Glass&#8211;Ceramic Electrolyte with High Ionic Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast synthesis of lithium argyrodite Li6&#8211;xPS5&#8211;xI1+x glass&#8211;ceramic electrolytes is accomplished via ultimate&#8208;energy mechanical alloying method within 1 h. A 45% S2&#8211;/I&#8211; disorder at 4d sites together with an ionic conductivity over 2 mS cm&#8211;1 is achieved for the optimal Li5.6PS4.6I1.4. The LiI&#8208;containing anodic interface helps solid&#8208;state batteries demonstrate prominent cycling stability and rate performance.








Abstract
Lithium argyrodites are one of the most promising sulfide electrolytes due to their high ionic conductivity and ductile feature. Among them, Li6PS5I (LPSI) exhibits better stability against Li metal but a rather low ionic conductivity (only &#8776;10&#8722;6 S cm&#8722;1) because of the absence of S2&#8722;/I&#8722; disorder. Herein, argyrodite Li6&#8722;xPS5&#8722;xI1+x glass&#8211;ceramic electrolytes with high iodine content are synthesized using ultimate&#8208;energy mechanical alloying method. S2&#8722;/I&#8722; disorder is successfully introduced into the system by doping LiI during this one&#8208;pot process. Determined by 6Li magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, the introduction of iodine promotes Li+ inter&#8208;cage jumps, leading to an enhanced long&#8208;range Li+ conducting. The Li5.6PS4.6I1.4 glass&#8211;ceramic electrolyte (LPSI1.4&#8208;gc) possesses high ionic conductivity (2.04 mS cm&#8722;1) and excellent stability against Li metal. The Li symmetric cell with the LPSI1.4&#8208;gc electrolyte demonstrates ultralong cycling stability over 3200 h at 0.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. LiCoO2/Li6PS5Cl/Li all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery applying LPSI1.4&#8208;gc as the anode interlayer also presents prominent cycling and rate performance. This work provides a novel type of electrolyte with high ionic conductivity and stability against Li metal.

         <title>Probing Electronic States in Monolayer Semiconductors through Static and Transient Third&#8208;Harmonic Spectroscopies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An advanced optical technique is introduced: broadband static and transient third&#8208;harmonic spectroscopies capture clear fingerprints of relevant electronic states in monolayer semiconductors with an unprecedentedly high contrast ratio up to 200 and further offer a dramatic advance in understanding of exciton dynamics with an ultrafast speed of &#8776;1 ps and high modulation depth up to 94%.








Abstract
Electronic states and their dynamics are of critical importance for electronic and optoelectronic applications. Here, various relevant electronic states in monolayer MoS2, such as multiple excitonic Rydberg states and free&#8208;particle energy bands are probed with a high relative contrast of up to &#8805;200 via broadband (from &#8776;1.79 to 3.10 eV) static third&#8208;harmonic spectroscopy (THS), which is further supported by theoretical calculations. Moreover, transient THS is introduced to demonstrate that third&#8208;harmonic generation can be all&#8208;optically modulated with a modulation depth exceeding &#8776;94% at &#8776;2.18&#160;eV, providing direct evidence of dominant carrier relaxation processes associated with carrier&#8211;exciton and carrier&#8211;phonon interactions. The results indicate that static and transient THS are not only promising techniques for the characterization of monolayer semiconductors and their heterostructures, but also a potential platform for disruptive photonic and optoelectronic applications, including all&#8208;optical modulation and imaging.

         <title>A Tri&#8208;Channel Oxide Transistor Concept for the Rapid Detection of Biomolecules Including the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike Protein</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processed metal oxide heterojunction channel with a geometrically engineered tri&#8208;channel architecture several millimeters in size, is developed and used as a generic platform for robust, selective, and ultrasensitive detection of various biomolecules. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, selective sensing of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein down to attomolar concentrations in under 2 min is demonstrated.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state transistor sensors that can detect biomolecules in real time are highly attractive for emerging bioanalytical applications. However, combining upscalable manufacturing with the required performance remains challenging. Here, an alternative biosensor transistor concept is developed, which relies on a solution&#8208;processed In2O3/ZnO semiconducting heterojunction featuring a geometrically engineered tri&#8208;channel architecture for the rapid, real&#8208;time detection of important biomolecules. The sensor combines a high electron mobility channel, attributed to the electronic properties of the In2O3/ZnO heterointerface, in close proximity to a sensing surface featuring tethered analyte receptors. The unusual tri&#8208;channel design enables strong coupling between the buried electron channel and electrostatic perturbations occurring during receptor&#8211;analyte interactions allowing for robust, real&#8208;time detection of biomolecules down to attomolar (am) concentrations. The experimental findings are corroborated by extensive device simulations, highlighting the unique advantages of the heterojunction tri&#8208;channel design. By functionalizing the surface of the geometrically engineered channel with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) antibody receptors, real&#8208;time detection of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike S1 protein down to am concentrations is demonstrated in under 2 min in physiological relevant conditions.

         <title>Atomic Visualization and Switching of Ferroelectric Order in &#946;&#8208;In2Se3 Films at the Single Layer Limit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single layer &#946;&#8242;&#8208; and &#946;*&#8208;In2Se3 films are experimentally validated to host 2D in&#8208;plane anti&#8208;ferroelectric and ferroelectric order, respectively, with structural and spectroscopic evidences characterized by low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)/spectroscopy. An electric field&#8208;induced phase transition is also realized via applying an STM tip pulse, demonstrating the manipulation of the ferroelectric polarization with reversible switching.








Abstract
2D ferroelectrics have received wide interest due to the remarkable quantum states of emerging physics at reduced dimensionality, associated with their exotic properties in high&#8208;performance and nonvolatile functional devices. Here, by combing molecular beam epitaxy synthesis and scanning tunneling microscopy characterization, two metastable phases of layered In2Se3 films: &#946;&#8242;&#8208; and &#946;*&#8208;In2Se3 are reported, which develop different types of in&#8208;plane spontaneous polarizations, thus resulting in different striped morphologies. The anti&#8208;ferroelectric order in &#946;&#8242;&#8208;In2Se3 and ferroelectric order of &#946;*&#8208;In2Se3 are identified, respectively, down to the 2D limit by comprehensive investigations of structural and spectroscopic signatures, including the lattice distortion, the spatial profile of images, the formation of domain structure, and the electronic band&#8208;bending by polarization charges at edges. The ferroelectric switching between those two phases are further controlled via applying an electric field generated from the scanning tunneling microscopy tip in a reversible manner. The intriguing tunability between the (anti&#8208;)ferroelectric orders in the 2D limit provides a promising platform for studying the interplay between electronic structure and ferroelectricity in van der Waals materials, and promotes potential development of miniaturized transistors and memory devices based on electric polarizations.

         <title>Liquid Gating Meniscus&#8208;Shaped Deformable Magnetoelastic Membranes with Self&#8208;Driven Regulation of Gas/Liquid Release</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid gating magnetoelastic membrane with meniscus&#8208;shaped deformations actuated by magnetic stimuli is reported to actively regulate gas/liquid release. It introduces a universal and new self&#8208;driven strategy for smart liquid gating membranes, combining fast and contactless operation and nonfouling behavior for energy&#8208;saving multiphase fluid transport and separation, and visible gas/liquid mixture content monitoring.








Abstract
Liquid gating membranes have been demonstrated to show unprecedented properties of dynamicity, stability, adaptivity, and stimulus&#8208;responsiveness. Most recently, smart liquid gating membranes have attracted increasing attention to bring some brand&#8208;new properties for real&#8208;world applications, and various environment&#8208;driven systems have been created. Here, a self&#8208;driven system of a smart liquid gating membrane is further developed by designing a new sytem based on a liquid gating magnetoelastic porous membrane with reversible meniscus&#8208;shaped deformations, and it is not subject to the complex gating liquid restriction of magnetorheological fluids. Compared with other systems, this magnetic&#8208;responsive self&#8208;driven system has the advantage that it provides a universal and convenient way to realize active regulation of gas/liquid release. Experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrate the stability, the nonfouling behavior, and the tunability of the system. In addition, this system can be used to perfectly open and close gas transport, and the gating pressure threshold for the liquid release can be reduced under the same conditions. Based on the above capabilities, combined with the fast and 3D contactless operation, it will be of benefit in fields ranging from visible gas/liquid mixture content monitoring and energy&#8208;saving multiphase separation, remote fluid release, and beyond.

         <title>Quenching&#8208;Resistant Multiresonance TADF Emitter Realizes 40% External Quantum Efficiency in Narrowband Electroluminescence at High Doping Level</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular design tactic to achieve quenching&#8208;resistant multiresonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters is proposed by fencing the MR&#8208;skeleton with steric units. Excellent electroluminescence performances are recorded in corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, with record&#8208;breaking external quantum efficiencies up to 40.0% and full width at half maximum values of only 25&#160;nm.








Abstract
Multiresonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters manifest great potential for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) due to their high exciton&#8208;utilization efficiency and narrowband emission. Nonetheless, their tendency toward self&#8208;quenching caused by strong interchromophore interactions would induce doping sensitivity and deteriorate the device performances, and effective strategy to construct quenching&#8208;resistant emitters without sacrifycing color purity is still to be developed. By segregating the planar MR&#8208;TADF skeleton using two bulky carbazolyl units, herein a highly emissive molecule with enhanced quenching resistance is reported. The steric effect largely removes the formation of detrimental excimers/aggregates, and boosts the performance of the corresponding devices with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) up to 40.0% and full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 25&#160;nm, representative of the only example of single OLED that can concurrently achieve narrow bandwidth and high EL efficiency surpassing 40% to date. Even at doping ratio of 30 wt%, the EQEmax is retained to be 33.3% with nearly unchanged emission spectrum. This work provides a viable approach to realize doping&#8208;insensitive MR&#8208;TADF devices with extreme EL efficiency and color purity for high&#8208;end OLED displays.

         <title>Roll&#8208;to&#8208;Roll Dry Transfer of Large&#8208;Scale Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll process is developed for dry transfer of large&#8208;scale graphene. With peeling speed and tension control, surface resistance of 9.5 k&#937;&#160;sq&#8722;1 is achieved on polyethylene terephthalate/ethylene vinyl acetate, allowing the fabrication of flexible graphene&#8208;based field effect transistors with 100 times lower gate leakage current and near&#8208;zero doping level compared with those fabricated using wet etched graphene samples.








Abstract
A major challenge for graphene applications is the lack of mass production technology for large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;quality graphene growth and transfer. Here, a roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll (R2R) dry transfer process for large&#8208;scale graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition is reported. The process is fast, controllable, and environmentally benign. It avoids chemical contamination and allows the reuse of graphene growth substrates. By controlling tension and speed of the R2R dry transfer process, the electrical sheet resistance is achieved as 9.5 k&#937;&#160;sq&#8722;1, the lowest ever reported among R2R dry transferred graphene samples. The R2R dry transferred samples are used to fabricate graphene&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistors (GFETs) on polymer. It is demonstrated that these flexible GFETs feature a near&#8208;zero doping level and a gate leakage current one to two orders of magnitude lower than those fabricated using wet&#8208;chemical etched graphene samples. The scalability and uniformity of the R2R dry transferred graphene is further demonstrated by successfully transferring a 3 &#215; 3&#160;in2 sample and measuring its field&#8208;effect mobility with 36 millimeter&#8208;scaled GFETs evenly spaced on the sample. The field&#8208;effect mobility of the R2R dry transferred graphene is determined to be 205 &#177; 36&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1.

         <title>Construction of Interfacial Electric Field via Dual&#8208;Porphyrin Heterostructure Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strong interfacial electric field is constructed through the dual&#8208;porphyrin heterostructure of tetrakis (4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) zinc porphyrin (ZnTCPP)/tetrakis (4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl) porphyrin (THPP), which greatly promotes charge separation and transfer. Meanwhile, dual porphyrins possess proper interface match to reduce recombination sites of interface charge carriers. Consequently, ZnTCPP/THPP exhibits an excellent photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 41.4&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1, exceeding most of the reported photocatalysts.








Abstract
A dual&#8208;porphyrin heterostructure is successfully constructed by coupling tetrakis (4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) zinc porphyrin (ZnTCPP) with tetrakis (4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl) porphyrin (THPP). The high photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 41.4&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 is obtained for ZnTCPP/THPP under full spectrum, which is &#8776;5.1 and &#8776;17.0 times higher than that of pure ZnTCPP and THPP, respectively. The significantly enhanced activity is mainly attributed to the giant interfacial electric field formed between dual porphyrins, which greatly facilitates efficient charge separation and transfer. Meanwhile, similar conjugated structures of dual porphyrins also provide proper interface match and decrease interface defects, thus inhibiting the recombination of photoproduced carriers. By rationally combining the appropriate band structures and high&#8208;quality interfacial contact of dual porphyrins, this work provides a fresh insight into the interfacial electric field construction to improve the photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Single Crystals Heterogeneity Impacts the Intrinsic and Extrinsic Properties of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of heterogeneities in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can be enormous at the single&#8208;particle level but is often neglected in characterization due to the lack of microscopes capable of correlated studies on the same crystals. The authors present an analysis platform for correlated, in situ spectroscopy and imaging named MOSAIC, and unveil new heterogeneity&#8211;property relations for two important MOF systems.








Abstract
At present, an enormous characterization gap exists between the study of the crystal structure of a material and its bulk properties. Individual particles falling within this gap cannot be fully characterized in a correlative manner by current methods. The authors address this problem by exploiting the noninvasive nature of optical microscopy and spectroscopy for the correlative analysis of metal&#8208;organic framework particles in situ. They probe the intrinsic as well as extrinsic properties in a correlated manner. The authors show that the crystal shape of MIL&#8208;88A strongly impacts its optical absorption. Furthermore, the question of how homogeneously water is distributed and adsorbed within one of the most promising materials for harvesting water from humid air, MOF&#8208;801, is addressed. The results demonstrate the considerable importance of the particle level and how it can affect the property of the material.

         <title>Design of Materials Configuration for Optimizing Redox&#8208;Based Resistive Switching Memories</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Influence of electrode and capping layer materials configuration in HfO2&#8208;based electrochemical metallization memory (ECM) and valence&#8208;change memory (VCM) types of redox&#8208;based resistive random access memory (ReRAM) cells is presented. Cyclic voltammetry reveals different interfacial electrochemical redox processes. The modulation of the resistive switching characteristics by varying the capping layer material in a combination with counter(bottom) electrode configurations are demonstrated and highlighted.








Abstract
Redox&#8208;based resistive random access memories (ReRAMs) are based on electrochemical processes of oxidation and reduction within the devices. The selection of materials and material combinations strongly influence the related nanoscale processes, playing a crucial role in resistive switching properties and functionalities. To date, however, comprehensive studies on device design accounting for a combination of factors such as electrodes, electrolytes, and capping layer materials related to their thicknesses and interactions are scarce. In this work, the impact of materials&#8217; configuration on interfacial redox reactions in HfO2&#8208;based electrochemical metallization memory (ECM) and valence&#8208;change memory (VCM) systems is reported. The redox processes are studied by cyclic voltammetry, and the corresponding resistive switching characteristics are investigated. In ECM cells, the overall cell resistance depends on the electrocatalytic activity of the counter electrode. Nonetheless, the capping layer material further influences the cell resistance and the SET and RESET voltages. In VCM systems, the influence of the electrode material configuration is also pronounced, and is capable of modulating the active resistive switching interface. For both types of memory cells, the switching behavior changes significantly with variation of the oxide thickness. The results present important materials selection criteria for rationale design of ReRAM cells for various memristive applications.

         <title>Rational Design of Dot&#8208;on&#8208;Rod Nano&#8208;Heterostructure for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction: Pivotal Role of Hole Transfer and Utilization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dot&#8208;on&#8208;rod (DOR) nano&#8208;heterostructure is rationally constructed by anchoring multiple ZnSe QDs on a single CdS nanorod. Due to the favored energy level alignment and the good exposure of ZnSe to the surrounding medium, ultrafast (&#8776;2&#160;ps) charge separation and facile hole utilization are realized, which enable effective and selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO photoreduction taking H2O as an electron donor.








Abstract
Inspired by green plants, artificial photosynthesis has become one of the most attractive approaches toward carbon dioxide (CO2) valorization. Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) or dot&#8208;in&#8208;rod (DIR) nano&#8208;heterostructures have gained substantial research interest in multielectron photoredox reactions. However, fast electron&#8211;hole recombination or sluggish hole transfer and utilization remains unsatisfactory for their potential applications. Here, the first application of a well&#8208;designed ZnSe/CdS dot&#8208;on&#8208;rods (DORs) nano&#8208;heterostructure for efficient and selective CO2 photoreduction with H2O as an electron donor is presented. In&#8208;depth spectroscopic studies reveal that surface&#8208;anchored ZnSe QDs not only assist ultrafast (&#8776;2&#160;ps) electron and hole separation, but also promote interfacial hole transfer participating in oxidative half&#8208;reactions. Surface photovoltage (SPV) spectroscopy provides a direct image of spatially separated electrons in CdS and holes in ZnSe. Therefore, ZnSe/CdS DORs photocatalyze CO2 to CO with a rate of &#8776;11.3&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and &#8805;85% selectivity, much higher than that of ZnSe/CdS DIRs or pristine CdS nanorods under identical conditions. Obviously, favored energy&#8208;level alignment and unique morphology balance the utilization of electrons and holes in this nano&#8208;heterostructure, thus enhancing the performance of artificial photosynthetic solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by green plants, artificial photosynthesis has become one of the most attractive approaches toward carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) valorization. Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) or dot-in-rod (DIR) nano-heterostructures have gained substantial research interest in multielectron photoredox reactions. However, fast electron&#8211;hole recombination or sluggish hole transfer and utilization remains unsatisfactory for their potential applications. Here, the first application of a well-designed ZnSe/CdS dot-on-rods (DORs) nano-heterostructure for efficient and selective CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O as an electron donor is presented. In-depth spectroscopic studies reveal that surface-anchored ZnSe QDs not only assist ultrafast (&#8776;2&#160;ps) electron and hole separation, but also promote interfacial hole transfer participating in oxidative half-reactions. Surface photovoltage (SPV) spectroscopy provides a direct image of spatially separated electrons in CdS and holes in ZnSe. Therefore, ZnSe/CdS DORs photocatalyze CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO with a rate of &#8776;11.3&#160;&#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and &#8805;85% selectivity, much higher than that of ZnSe/CdS DIRs or pristine CdS nanorods under identical conditions. Obviously, favored energy-level alignment and unique morphology balance the utilization of electrons and holes in this nano-heterostructure, thus enhancing the performance of artificial photosynthetic solar-to-chemical conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Low&#8208;Threshold, Highly Stable Colloidal Quantum Dot Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Laser enabled by Suppression of Trap&#8208;Assisted Auger Recombination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A short&#8208;wave infrared single&#8208;mode laser is demonstrated based on PbS colloidal quantum dots (CQDs), which exhibit low threshold and highly&#8208;stable performance owing to suppression of trap&#8208;assisted Auger recombination at supra&#8208;nanocrystalline level. PbS CQDs act as a gain medium where their trap states are electronically passivated by the donated electrons from ZnO nanocrystals.








Abstract
Pb&#8208;chalcogenide colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are attractive materials to be used as tuneable laser media across the infrared spectrum. However, excessive nonradiative Auger recombination due to the presence of trap states outcompetes light amplification by rapidly annihilating the exciton population, leading to high gain thresholds. Here, a binary blend is employed of CQDs and ZnO nanocrystals in order to passivate the in&#8208;gap trap states of PbS&#8208;CQD gain medium. Using transient absorption, a fivefold increase is measured in Auger lifetime demonstrating the suppression of trap&#8208;assisted Auger recombination. By doing so, a twofold reduction is achieved in amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) threshold. Finally, by integrating the proposed binary blend to a distributed feedback (DFB) resonator, single&#8208;mode lasing emission is demonstrated at 1650&#160;nm with a linewidth of 1.23&#160;nm (0.62 meV), operating at a low lasing threshold of &#8776;385 &#956;J cm&#8211;2. The Auger suppression in this system has allowed to achieve unprecedented lasing emission stability for a CQD laser with recorded continuous operation of 5 h at room temperature and ambient conditions.

         <title>Coordination Polymer&#8208;Coated CaCO3 Reinforces Radiotherapy by Reprogramming the Immunosuppressive Metabolic Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acidity&#8208;IDO1 modulation nanoparticles (AIM NPs) can effectively promote the transition of immunosuppressive (cold) tumor microenvironment to immune&#8208;activated (hot) one via simultaneous tumor acidity neutralization and Kyn depletion. In synergizing with AIM NPs injection, treatment with external X&#8208;ray irradiation can effectively suppress the growth of irradiated primary tumors, distant unirradiated (metastatic) tumors, and rechallenged (relapsed) tumors by eliciting potent antitumor immunity.








Abstract
Radiotherapy is widely exploited for the treatment of a large range of cancers in clinic, but its therapeutic effectiveness is seriously crippled by the tumor immunosuppression, mainly driven by the altered metabolism of cancer cells. Here, a pH&#8208;responsive nanomedicine is prepared by coating calcium carbonate (CaCO3) nanoparticles with 4&#8208;phenylimidazole (4PI), an inhibitor against indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase 1 (IDO&#8208;1), together with zinc ions via the coordination reaction, aiming at reinforcing the treatment outcome of radiotherapy. The obtained pH&#8208;responsive nanomedicine, coined as acidity&#8208;IDO1&#8208;modulation nanoparticles (AIM NPs), is able to instantly neutralize protons, and release 4PI to suppress the IDO1&#8208;mediated production of kynurenine (Kyn) upon tumor accumulation. As a result, treatment with AIM NPs can remarkably enhance the therapeutic efficacy of radiotherapy against both murine CT26 and 4T1 tumors by eliciting potent antitumor immunity. Furthermore, it is shown that such combination treatment can effectively suppress the growth of untreated distant tumors via the abscopal effect, and result in immune memory responses to reject rechallenged tumors. This work highlights a novel strategy of simultaneous tumor acidity neutralization and IDO1 inhibition to potentiate radiotherapy, with great promises to suppress tumor metastasis and recurrence by eliciting robust antitumor immunity.

         <title>Highly Efficient Self&#8208;Healing Multifunctional Dressing with Antibacterial Activity for Sutureless Wound Closure and Infected Wound Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel self&#8208;healing elastomer&#8208;based multifunctional wound dressing (MFWD) with desirable mechanical robustness, biocompatibility, and antibacterial activity is developed for effective wound management. MFWD assists in contracting wound edges, based on the excellent self&#8208;healing ability of the elastomer. The wound status can also be comprehensively monitored and reported with this MFWD.








Abstract
Wound healing represents a major clinical and public healthcare problem that is frequently challenged by infection risks, detrimental consequences on the surrounding tissues, and difficulties to monitor the healing process. Here we&#160;report on a novel self&#8208;healing, antibacterial, and multifunctional wound dressing for sutureless wound closure and real&#8208;time monitoring of the healing parameters. The self&#8208;healing elastomer contains cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and has high mechanical toughness (35&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), biocompatibility, and outstanding antibacterial activity (bactericidal rate is &#8776;90% in 12 h), enabling the wound dressing to effectively inhibit bacterial growth and accelerate infected wound healing. In vivo tests based on full&#8208;thickness skin incision model shows that the multifunctional wound dressing can help in contracting wound edges and facilitate wound closure and healing, as could be evidenced by notably dense and well&#8208;organized collagen deposition. The test provides an evidence that the integrated sensor array within the multifunctional wound dressing can monitor temperature, pH, and glucose level of the wound area in real&#8208;time, providing reliable and timely information of the condition of the wound. Ultimately, the reported multifunctional dressing would be of high value in managing the burden associated with wound healing via personalised monitoring and treatment approaches, digital and other people&#8208;centred solutions for health care.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Cu2O Mesh Pattern on High&#8208;Facet Cu Surface for Selective CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined structure with Cu+ and high&#8208;facets is developed via insufficient graphene growth and a postoxidation process. The synthesized catalysts show high ethanol selectivity from the electrochemical CO2 reduction. The enhanced CO binding strength due to the introduction of Cu+ induces stable CO adsorption while maintaining high&#8208;facet properties, resulting in a favorable CO&#8211;CO coupling reaction for C2 formation.








Abstract
Although the electroconversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into ethanol is considered to be one of the most promising ways of using CO2, the ethanol selectivity is less than 50% because of difficulties in designing an optimal catalyst that arise from the complicated pathways for the electroreduction of CO2 to ethanol. Several approaches including the fabrication of oxide&#8208;derived structures, atomic surface control, and the Cu+/Cu interfaces have been primarily used to produce ethanol from CO2. Here, a combined structure with Cu+ and high&#8208;facets as electrocatalysts is constructed by creating high&#8208;facets of wrinkled Cu surrounded by Cu2O mesh patterns. Using chemical vapor deposition graphene growth procedures, the insufficiently grown graphene is used as an oxidation&#8208;masking material, and the high&#8208;facet wrinkled Cu is simultaneously generated during the graphene growth synthesis. The resulting electrocatalyst shows an ethanol selectivity of 43% at &#8722;0.8&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, which is one of the highest ethanol selectivity values reported thus far. This is attributed to the role of Cu+ in enhancing CO binding strength, and the high&#8208;facets, which favor C&#8211;C coupling and the ethanol pathway. This method for generating the combined structure can be widely applicable not only for electrochemical catalysts but also in various fields.

         <title>Spiderweb Nanomechanical Resonators via Bayesian Optimization: Inspired by Nature and Guided by Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Human creativity, analytical models, and trial&#8208;and&#8208;error experimentation have led to groundbreaking achievements in nanotechnology. In this work, machine learning is shown to offer a new path to discovery, complementing the traditional process. A spiderweb&#8208;inspired sensor is designed and fabricated by this strategy achieving world&#8208;class performance. The algorithm finds a novel vibration mechanism, enabling devices isolated from room&#8208;temperature environments.








Abstract
From ultrasensitive detectors of fundamental forces to quantum networks and sensors, mechanical resonators are enabling next&#8208;generation technologies to operate in room&#8208;temperature environments. Currently, silicon nitride nanoresonators stand as a leading microchip platform in these advances by allowing for mechanical resonators whose motion is remarkably isolated from ambient thermal noise. However, to date, human intuition has remained the driving force behind design processes. Here, inspired by nature and guided by machine learning, a spiderweb nanomechanical resonator is developed that exhibits vibration modes, which are isolated from ambient thermal environments via a novel &#8220;torsional soft&#8208;clamping&#8221; mechanism discovered by the data&#8208;driven optimization algorithm. This bioinspired resonator is then fabricated, experimentally confirming a new paradigm in mechanics with quality factors above 1 billion in room&#8208;temperature environments. In contrast to other state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art resonators, this milestone is achieved with a compact design that does not require sub&#8208;micrometer lithographic features or complex phononic bandgaps, making it significantly easier and cheaper to manufacture at large scales. These results demonstrate the ability of machine learning to work in tandem with human intuition to augment creative possibilities and uncover new strategies in computing and nanotechnology.

         <title>Elucidating and Mitigating High&#8208;Voltage Degradation Cascades in Cobalt&#8208;Free LiNiO2 Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice oxygen loss is found to play a critical role in the O3&#8211;O1 stacking transition in cobalt&#8208;free LiNiO2 lithium&#8208;ion battery cathodes, which subsequently induces Ni&#8208;ion migration and irreversible stacking faults, microscale creep, cracking, and even bending of layers after high&#8208;voltage cycling. By suppressing oxygen evolution, hermetic graphene coatings arrest this degradation cascade, resulting in substantially improved high&#8208;voltage capacity retention.








Abstract
LiNiO2 (LNO) is a promising cathode material for next&#8208;generation Li&#8208;ion batteries due to its exceptionally high capacity and cobalt&#8208;free composition that enables more sustainable and ethical large&#8208;scale manufacturing. However, its poor cycle life at high operating voltages over 4.1&#160;V impedes its practical use, thus motivating efforts to elucidate and mitigate LiNiO2 degradation mechanisms at high states of charge. Here, a multiscale exploration of high&#8208;voltage degradation cascades associated with oxygen stacking chemistry in cobalt&#8208;free LiNiO2, is presented. Lattice oxygen loss is found to play a critical role in the local O3&#8211;O1 stacking transition at high states of charge, which subsequently leads to Ni&#8208;ion migration and irreversible stacking faults during cycling. This undesirable atomic&#8208;scale structural evolution accelerates microscale electrochemical creep, cracking, and even bending of layers, ultimately resulting in macroscopic mechanical degradation of LNO particles. By employing a graphene&#8208;based hermetic surface coating, oxygen loss is attenuated in LNO at high states of charge, which suppresses the initiation of the degradation cascade and thus substantially improves the high&#8208;voltage capacity retention of LNO. Overall, this study provides mechanistic insight into the high&#8208;voltage degradation of LNO, which will inform ongoing efforts to employ cobalt&#8208;free cathodes in Li&#8208;ion battery technology.

         <title>Direct&#8208;Bandgap Bilayer WSe2/Microsphere Monolithic Cavity for Low&#8208;Threshold Lasing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD)/cavity monolithic cavity is achieved by directly growing single&#8208;domain tungsten diselenide (WSe2) bilayers on single silica microsphere (MS) surfaces. The thermal strain induces bilayer bandgap from indirect to direct, and the cavity confinement factor is also improved, which directly realizes room&#8208;temperature whispering&#8208;gallery&#8208;mode lasing, with a threshold nearly an order of magnitude lower than the existing records.








Abstract
Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as widely accepted 2D gain materials in the field of light sources owing to their direct bandgap and high photoluminescence quantum yield. However, the monolayer medium suffers from weak emission because only a single layer of molecules can absorb the pump energy. Moreover, the material degradation when transferring these fragile materials hinders their cooperation with the optical cavity further. In this study, for the first time, a high&#8208;quality monolithic structure is developed by directly growing single&#8208;domain tungsten diselenide (WSe2) bilayers on single silica microsphere (MS) cavities. Such a completely wrapped structure guides the indirect&#8208;to&#8208;direct bandgap transition of WSe2 bilayers, leading to a significantly improved photoluminescence intensity by about 60&#8208;fold. Moreover, the high&#8208;quality monolithic structure enhances the confinement factor of the cavity by more than 20&#8208;fold. Based on the above advantages, a bilayer WSe2/MS microlaser is realized with an ultralow threshold of 0.72 W&#160;cm&#8722;2, nearly an order of magnitude lower than the existing records. The results demonstrate the possibility of using multilayer TMD materials as 2D gain media and provide insights into a new ultracompact monolithic platform of TMD material/cavity for lasing devices.

         <title>Thermally Controlled Charge&#8208;Carrier Transitions in Disordered PbSbTe Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is shown experimentally that the carrier type and mobility in Pb&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te thin films can be controlled by annealing the disordered crystal. First&#8208;principles simulations indicate that the unexpected transition from n&#8208; to p&#8208;conduction is caused by a crossover of the predominant point&#8208;defect type with increasing order. Tuning self&#8208;doping properties this way could prove useful for thermoelectric devices and other applications.








Abstract
Binary and ternary chalcogenides have recently attracted much attention due to their wide range of applications including phase&#8208;change memory materials, topological insulators, photonic switches, and thermoelectrics. These applications require a precise control of the number and mobility of charge carriers. Here, an unexpected charge&#8208;carrier transition in ternary compounds from the PbTe&#8211;Sb2Te3 pseudo&#8208;binary line is reported. Upon thermal annealing, sputtered thin films of PbSb2Te4 and Pb2Sb2Te5 undergo a transition in the temperature coefficient of resistance and in the type of the majority charge carriers from n&#8208;type to p&#8208;type. These transitions are observed upon increasing structural order within one crystallographic phase. To account for this striking observation, it is proposed that the Fermi energy shifts from the tail of the conduction band to the valence band because different levels of overall structural disorder lead to different predominant types of native point defects. This view is confirmed by an extensive computational study, revealing a transition from excess cations and SbPb for high levels of disorder to PbSb prevailing for low disorder. The findings will help fine&#8208;tune transport properties in certain chalcogenides via proper thermal treatment, with potential benefits for memories, thermoelectric material optimization, and neuromorphic devices.

         <title>Hierarchically Porous Silica Membrane as Separator for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled arrays of closely&#8208;packed hollow mesoporous silica (HMS) particles on the cathode surface can serve as ultralight, mechanically robust, and thermally stable separators for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Thanks to their inorganic nature and hierarchically porous structure, the HMS separators display higher electrolyte affinity and ionic conductivity compared to commercial polypropylene separators, endowing LIBs with exceptional rate capability and cycling stability.








Abstract
Commercial polymeric separators in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) typically suffer from limited porosity, low electrolyte wettability, and poor thermal and mechanical stability, which can degrade the battery performance especially at high current densities. Here, the design of hierarchically porous, ultralight silica membranes as separator for high&#8208;performance LIBs is reported through the assembly of hollow mesoporous silica (HMS) particles on the cathode surface. The rich mesopores and large cavity of individual HMS particles provide low&#8208;tortuosity pathways for ionic transport, while simultaneously serving as electrolyte reservoir to further boost the electrochemical kinetics. Moreover, benefiting from their inorganic and hierarchically porous nature, such HMS separators display better electrolyte affinity, thermal stability, and mechanical strength than commercial polypropylene (PP) separators. As a demonstration, LIBs with a LiFePO4 cathode coated with HMS separators exhibit exceptional rate capability and cycling stability, outperforming LIBs with PP and Al2O3&#8208;modified PP separators as well as separators made of solid silica particles.

         <title>Highly Stiff and Stretchable DNA Liquid Crystalline Organogels with Super Plasticity, Ultrafast Self&#8208;Healing, and Magnetic Response Behaviors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of DNA soft material driven by supramolecular interactions has been developed. Exceptional stretchability, deformability, plasticity, and ultrafast self&#8208;healing property have been observed due to the formed internal mesophase ordering. Moreover, the DNA&#8208;based liquid crystalline organogels exhibit impressive ultimate tensile strengths and stiffness, rendering the materials the strongest among reported DNA networks.








Abstract
DNA&#8208;based gels are attractive materials as they allow intuitive rational design, respond to external physicochemical stimuli, and show great potential for biomedical applications. However, their relatively poor mechanical properties currently limit their technological application considerably as the latter requires mechanical integrity and tunability. With this work, a DNA organogel is reported that gels through supramolecular interactions, which induce mesophase ordering, and that exhibits exceptional stretchability, deformability, plasticity, and biocompatibility. Moreover, the nature of the supramolecular bond enables complete self&#8208;healing within 3 s. Most importantly, the DNA&#8208;based liquid crystalline organogels exhibit impressive ultimate tensile strengths above 1&#160;MPa, stiffness higher than 20&#160;MPa, and toughness up to 18&#160;MJ m&#8722;3, rendering these materials the strongest among reported DNA networks. In addition, the facile access is demonstrated to composite DNA materials by blending magnetic nanoparticles with the organogel matrix giving access to magnetic field induced actuation. It is believed that these findings contribute significantly to the advancement of DNA gels for their use in smart materials and biomedical applications.

         <title>Giant Thermal Transport Tuning at a Metal/Ferroelectric Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Giant thermal transport tuning is observed at a metal/ferroelectric interface by switching the ferroelectric polarization orientations. This work shows that surface bound charges at a metal/insulator interface can substantially enhance the interfacial electron&#8211;phonon&#8208;mediated thermal coupling, providing a new route to optimize the thermal transport performance in the next&#8208;generation nanodevices, power electronics, and thermal logic devices.








Abstract
Interfacial thermal transport plays a prominent role in the thermal management of nanoscale objects and is of fundamental importance for basic research and nanodevices. At metal/insulator interfaces, a configuration commonly found in electronic devices, heat transport strongly depends upon the effective energy transfer from thermalized electrons in the metal to the phonons in the insulator. However, the mechanism of interfacial electron&#8211;phonon coupling and thermal transport at metal/insulator interfaces is not well understood. Here, the observation of a substantial enhancement of the interfacial thermal resistance and the important role of surface charges at the metal/ferroelectric interface in an Al/BiFeO3 membrane are reported. By applying uniaxial strain, the interfacial thermal resistance can be varied substantially (up to an order of magnitude), which is attributed to the renormalized interfacial electron&#8211;phonon coupling caused by the charge redistribution at the interface due to the polarization rotation. These results imply that surface charges at a metal/insulator interface can substantially enhance the interfacial electron&#8211;phonon&#8208;mediated thermal coupling, providing a new route to optimize the thermal transport performance in next&#8208;generation nanodevices, power electronics, and thermal logic devices.

         <title>Electrically Tunable and Dramatically Enhanced Valley&#8208;Polarized Emission of Monolayer WS2 at Room Temperature with Plasmonic Archimedes Spiral Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient tailoring of valley&#8208;polarized photoluminescence from monolayer WS2 at room temperature (RT) through surface plasmon&#8211;exciton interactions with plasmonic Archimedes spiral (PAS) nanostructures is achieved in this manuscript. The degree of valley polarization of WS2&#8211;PAS heterostructures at RT can be further enhanced from 40% to 70% by modulating the carrier doping via a backgate field effect transistor (FET) device.








Abstract
Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have intrinsic valley degrees of freedom, making them appealing for exploiting valleytronic applications in information storage and processing. WS2 monolayer possesses two inequivalent valleys in the Brillouin zone, each valley coupling selectively with a circular polarization of light. The degree of valley polarization (DVP) under the excitation of circularly polarized light (CPL) is a parameter that determines the purity of valley polarized photoluminescence (PL) of monolayer WS2. Here efficient tailoring of valley&#8208;polarized PL from monolayer WS2 at room temperature (RT) through surface plasmon&#8211;exciton interactions with plasmonic Archimedes spiral (PAS) nanostructures is reported. The DVP of WS2 at RT can be enhanced from &lt;5% to 40% and 50% by using 2 turns (2T) and 4 turns (4T) of PAS, respectively. Further enhancement and control of excitonic valley polarization is demonstrated by electrostatically doping monolayer WS2. For CPL on WS2&#8211;2TPAS heterostructures, the 40% valley polarization is enhanced to 70% by modulating the carrier doping via a backgate, which may be attributed to the screening of momentum&#8208;dependent long&#8208;range electron&#8211;hole exchange interactions. The manifestation of electrically tunable valley&#8208;polarized emission from WS2&#8211;PAS heterostructures presents a new strategy toward harnessing valley excitons for application in ultrathin valleytronic devices.

         <title>Tunable Supramolecular Cavities Molecularly Homogenized in Polymer Membranes for Ultraefficient Precombustion CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soluble organic macrocyclic cavitands (OMCs) with interactive affinity for polymers can be utilized to design novel nanocomposite membranes with true molecular homogeneity, unlike conventional nanoarchitectures that form heterogeneous nanofiller phases within membranes that cause performance and processability issues. By adjusting the OMC cavity size within the membranes, tunable gas transport properties can be obtained for highly molecular&#8208;sieving H2/CO2 separation.








Abstract
Processable molecular&#8208;sieving membranes are important materials for realizing energy&#8208;efficient precombustion CO2 capture during industrial&#8208;scale hydrogen production. However, the promising design of mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) that aims to integrate the molecular&#8208;sieving properties of nanoporous architectures with industrial processable polymers still faces performance and fabrication issues due to the formation of segregated nanofiller domains in their polymer matrices. Here, an unconventional nanocomposite membrane design is proposed using soluble organic macrocyclic cavitands (OMCs) with tunable open cavity sizes that not only mitigate the formation the discrete nanofiller phases but also deliver distinct molecular&#8208;sieving separations. The versatile organic&#8208;solvent solubility coupled with highly interactive functionalities of OMCs allows them to obtain molecularly homogeneous mixing with matrix polymers and form only one integral continuous phase crucial to the robust processability of polymers. A series of polybenzimidazole&#8208;based molecularly mixed composite membranes (MMCMs) are fabricated via the incorporation of a soluble and thermally stable OMC choice, sulfocalixarenes, with various cavity sizes. These membranes achieve outstanding high&#8208;temperature mixed&#8208;gas H2/CO2 separation performances comparable with several state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art molecular&#8208;sieving membranes owing to effective size&#8208;sieving gas passages through the open or partially&#8208;intruded supramolecular cavities. The broadly tunable structures and functionalities of OMCs would make their MMCMs attractive for other energy&#8208;intensive molecular separations.

&lt;p&gt;Soluble organic macrocyclic cavitands (OMCs) with interactive affinity for polymers can be utilized to design novel nanocomposite membranes with true molecular homogeneity, unlike conventional nanoarchitectures that form heterogeneous nanofiller phases within membranes that cause performance and processability issues. By adjusting the OMC cavity size within the membranes, tunable gas transport properties can be obtained for highly molecular-sieving H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Processable molecular-sieving membranes are important materials for realizing energy-efficient precombustion CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture during industrial-scale hydrogen production. However, the promising design of mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) that aims to integrate the molecular-sieving properties of nanoporous architectures with industrial processable polymers still faces performance and fabrication issues due to the formation of segregated nanofiller domains in their polymer matrices. Here, an unconventional nanocomposite membrane design is proposed using soluble organic macrocyclic cavitands (OMCs) with tunable open cavity sizes that not only mitigate the formation the discrete nanofiller phases but also deliver distinct molecular-sieving separations. The versatile organic-solvent solubility coupled with highly interactive functionalities of OMCs allows them to obtain molecularly homogeneous mixing with matrix polymers and form only one integral continuous phase crucial to the robust processability of polymers. A series of polybenzimidazole-based molecularly mixed composite membranes (MMCMs) are fabricated via the incorporation of a soluble and thermally stable OMC choice, sulfocalixarenes, with various cavity sizes. These membranes achieve outstanding high-temperature mixed-gas H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation performances comparable with several state-of-the-art molecular-sieving membranes owing to effective size-sieving gas passages through the open or partially-intruded supramolecular cavities. The broadly tunable structures and functionalities of OMCs would make their MMCMs attractive for other energy-intensive molecular separations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Full&#8208;Color Holographic Display and Encryption with Full&#8208;Polarization Degree of Freedom</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A minimalist metasurface assembling geometric phase meta&#8208;atoms in a tetratomic macro pixel is proposed, which enables the full degree of freedom tuning in polarization (orientation, ellipticity, and chirality) and color (real hue, saturation, and brightness) spaces simultaneously. The proposed strategy has great potential in multiplex&#8208;oriented applications, such as holographic data storage and information transfer.








Abstract
Metasurfaces provide a compact and powerful platform for manipulating the fundamental properties of light, and have shown unprecedented capabilities in both optical holographic display and information encryption. For increasing information display/storage capacity, metasurfaces with more polarization manipulation channel and full&#8208;color holographic functionality are now an urgent requirement. Here, a minimalist dielectric metasurface with the capability of full&#8208;color holography encoded with arbitrary polarization is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. Without the daunting exploratory and computational problem in nanostructure searching, full&#8208;color holographic images can be multiplexed into arbitrary polarization channels through vectorial ptychography and k&#8208;space ptychography based on tetratomic macropixel geometric phase metasurfaces. Thanks to the full degree of freedom tuning in polarization and color spaces, the application scenarios such as holographic 3D imaging and information encryption are realized. The strategy exhibits promising potential in applications of 3Dl display, augmented/virtual reality, high&#8208;density data storage, and encryption.

Wound Healing
In article number 2106842, Miaomiao Yuan, Daxiang Cui, Hossam Haick, and co&#8208;workers report a novel self&#8208;healing elastomer&#8208;based multifunctional wound dressing (MFWD) with desirable mechanical robustness, biocompatibility, and antibacterial activity for effective wound management. MFWD assists in contracting wound edges, based on the excellent self&#8208;healing ability of the elastomer, and enables tracking of the wound health status in real&#8208;time via a set of (bio)chemical and physical sensors integrated therein.

Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries
In article number 2106402, Mark C. Hersam and co&#8208;workers show that lattice oxygen loss plays a critical role in the O3&#8211;O1 stacking transition in cobalt&#8208;free LiNiO2 lithium&#8208;ion battery cathodes, which subsequently induces Ni&#8208;ion migration and irreversible stacking faults, microscale electrochemical creep, cracking, and even bending of layers after high&#8208;voltage cycling. By suppressing oxygen evolution, hermetic graphene coatings arrest this degradation cascade, resulting in substantially improved high&#8208;voltage capacity retention.

Near&#8208;Surface Doping
In article number 2103235, David N. Jamieson and co&#8208;workers report that single&#8208;crystal silicon can be configured with arrays of single, near&#8208;surface, dopant atoms using on&#8208;chip electrodes and low&#8208;noise charge&#8208;sensitive electronics to register single&#8208;ion implants. Suitable for integration with a nanostencil scanner to localize the implants, the system makes use of the signal of electron&#8211;hole pairs generated as the ions dissipate their kinetic energy in the crystal. The system can be part of an engineering strategy for high&#8208;confidence fabrication of large&#8208;scale donor arrays to exploit donor spin ensembles in silicon devices.

In article number 2105156, Tai&#8208;Shung Chung and co&#8208;workers show how soluble organic macrocyclic cavitands (OMCs) with interactive affinity for polymers can be utilized to design novel nanocomposite membranes with true molecular homogeneity, unlike conventional nanoarchitectures that form heterogeneous nanofiller phases within membranes that cause performance and processability issues. By adjusting the OMC cavity size within the membranes, tunable gas&#8208;transport properties can be obtained for molecular&#8208;sieving H2/CO2 separation.

2D Materials
In article number 2106674, Kai Xiao and co&#8208;workers develop a nonequilibrium chemical vapor deposition approach for selective formation of antisite defects in atomically thin 2D tungsten sulfide monolayer crystals by regulating the diffusion of tungsten into gold substrates. This work demonstrates a novel strategy for the selective formation of defects in 2D materials by tuning their formation energy during synthesis via choice of substrate and alloy design.

         <title>New Dimension in Magnetism and Superconductivity: 3D and Curvilinear Nanoarchitectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rapidly developing field of curvilinear magnetism and superconductivity is reviewed. The covered topics range from novel physical concepts for material science through first proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept device demonstrations to established technologies of flexible magnetoelectronics. The review is relevant for a broad community of physicists, material scientists, and engineers, targeting fundamental research and technology transfer activities.








Abstract
Traditionally, the primary field, where curvature has been at the heart of research, is the theory of general relativity. In recent studies, however, the impact of curvilinear geometry enters various disciplines, ranging from solid&#8208;state physics over soft&#8208;matter physics, chemistry, and biology to mathematics, giving rise to a plethora of emerging domains such as curvilinear nematics, curvilinear studies of cell biology, curvilinear semiconductors, superfluidity, optics, 2D van der Waals materials, plasmonics, magnetism, and superconductivity. Here, the state of the art is summarized and prospects for future research in curvilinear solid&#8208;state systems exhibiting such fundamental cooperative phenomena as ferromagnetism, antiferromagnetism, and superconductivity are outlined. Highlighting the recent developments and current challenges in theory, fabrication, and characterization of curvilinear micro&#8208; and nanostructures, special attention is paid to perspective research directions entailing new physics and to their strong application potential. Overall, the perspective is aimed at crossing the boundaries between the magnetism and superconductivity communities and drawing attention to the conceptual aspects of how extension of structures into the third dimension and curvilinear geometry can modify existing and aid launching novel functionalities. In addition, the perspective should stimulate the development and dissemination of research and development oriented techniques to facilitate rapid transitions from laboratory demonstrations to industry&#8208;ready prototypes and eventual products.

         <dc:description>
The extension of shape&#8208;morphing capabilities to the micro&#8208; and nanoscale has recently enabled novel applications in photonics, microrobotics, biomedicine, and microfluidics. The materials, mechanisms, and fabrication technologies used to create shape&#8208;changing micro&#8208; and nanoparticles are discussed, and key demonstrations in various application areas are summarized comprehensive review.








Abstract
Demands for next&#8208;generation soft and responsive materials have sparked recent interest in the development of shape&#8208;changing particles and particle assemblies. Over the last two decades, a variety of mechanisms that drive shape change have been explored and integrated into particulate systems. Through a combination of top&#8208;down fabrication and bottom&#8208;up synthesis techniques, shape&#8208;morphing capabilities extend from the microscale to the nanoscale. Consequently, shape&#8208;morphing particles are rapidly emerging in a variety of contexts, including photonics, microfluidics, microrobotics, and biomedicine. Herein, the key mechanisms and materials that facilitate shape changes of microscale and nanoscale particles are discussed. Recent progress in the applications made possible by these particles is summarized, and perspectives on their promise and key open challenges in the field are discussed.

Bioprinting has emerged as a promising strategy for fabrication of functional organs in the lab. Until recently, however, this has mostly been restricted to a few miniaturized tissues with rudimentary biological activity. This review discusses a series of milestones that have paved the way for bioprinting of 3D multicellular tissues and organ with advanced levels of biological and architectural mimicry.








Abstract
Bioprinting has emerged as one of the most promising strategies for fabrication of functional organs in the lab as an alternative to transplant organs. While progress in the field has mostly been restricted to a few miniaturized tissues with minimal biological functionality until a few years ago, recent progress has advanced the concept of building three&#8208;dimensional multicellular organ complexity remarkably. This review discusses a series of milestones that have paved the way for bioprinting of tissue constructs that have advanced levels of biological and architectural functionality. Critical materials, engineering and biological challenges that are key to addressing the desirable function of engineered organs are presented. These are discussed in light of the many difficulties to replicate the heterotypic organization of multicellular solid organs, the nanoscale precision of the extracellular microenvironment in hierarchical tissues, as well as the advantages and limitations of existing bioprinting methods to adequately overcome these barriers. In summary, the advances of the field toward realistic manufacturing of functional organs have never been so extensive, and this manuscript serves as a road map for some of the recent progress and the challenges ahead.

         <title>Advancing 2D Perovskites for Efficient and Stable Solar Cells: Challenges and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solar cells incorporating 2D perovskites show tradeoffs between efficiency and stability. The challenges these solar cells face are identified and select works the community has undertaken to overcome them are highlighted in this review. Several recommendations are proposed on how to further improve perovskite solar cells so their performance and stability can be commensurate with application requirements.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly emerged as one of the hottest topics in the photovoltaics community owing to their high power&#8208;conversion efficiencies (PCE), and the promise to be produced at low cost. Among various PSCs, typical 3D perovskite&#8208;based solar cells deliver high PCE but they suffer from severe instability, which restricts their practical applications. In contrast to 3D perovskites, 2D perovskites that incorporate larger, less volatile, and generally more hydrophobic organic cations exhibit much improved thermal, chemical, and environmental stability. 2D perovskites can have different roles within a solar cell, either as the primary light absorber (2D PSCs), or as a capping layer atop a 3D perovskite absorbing layer (2D/3D PSCs). Tradeoffs between PCE and stability exist in both types of PSCs&#8212;2D PSCs are more stable but exhibit lower efficiency while 2D/3D PSCs deliver exciting efficiency but show relatively poor stability. To address this PCE/stability tradeoff, the challenges both the 2D and 2D/3D PSCs face are identified and select works the community has undertaken to overcome them are highlighted in this review. It is ended with several recommendations on how to further improve PSCs so their performance and stability can be commensurate with application requirements.

         <title>4D Printing of Liquid Crystals: What's Right for Me?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystals are the basis for many &#8220;smart&#8221; materials used in, for instance, soft robotics and polymer optics. Recently, their potential and appeal for different additive manufacturing techniques has been demonstrated. Insight into the usage of liquid crystals in 3D printing for fabrication at both micro&#8208; and centimeterscale is provided for those wanting to join this exciting, developing field.








Abstract
Recent years have seen major advances in the developments of both additive manufacturing concepts and responsive materials. When combined as 4D printing, the process can lead to functional materials and devices for use in health, energy generation, sensing, and soft robots. Among responsive materials, liquid crystals, which can deliver programmed, reversible, rapid responses in both air and underwater, are a prime contender for additive manufacturing, given their ease of use and adaptability to many different applications. In this paper, selected works are compared and analyzed to come to a didactical overview of the liquid crystal&#8208;additive manufacturing junction. Reading from front to back gives the reader a comprehensive understanding of the options and challenges in the field, while researchers already experienced in either liquid crystals or additive manufacturing are encouraged to scan through the text to see how they can incorporate additive manufacturing or liquid crystals into their own work. The educational text is closed with proposals for future research in this crossover field.

         <title>Treatment of Ruptured and Nonruptured Aneurysms Using a Semisolid Iodinated Embolic Agent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel semisolid gel embolization agent is presented to achieve instant occlusion of saccular aneurysms. This approach is&#160;developed, optimized, and tested in vitro, in 3D models, in vivo in rat and in porcine arterial aneurysms. Most importantly, in ruptured porcine aneurysms causing catastrophic bleeding, the gel embolic material is able to achieve instant hemostasis in survival experiments.








Abstract
Saccular aneurysms (SAs) are focal outpouchings from the lateral wall of an artery. Depending on their morphology and location, minimally invasive treatment options include coil embolization, flow diverter stents, stent&#8208;assisted coiling, and liquid embolics. Many drawbacks are associated with these treatment options including recanalization, delayed healing, rebleeding, malpositioning of the embolic or stent, stent stenosis, and even rupture of the SA. To overcome these drawbacks, a nanoclay&#8208;based shear&#8208;thinning hydrogel (STH) is&#160;developed for the endovascular treatment of SAs. Extensive in vitro testing is&#160;performed to optimize STH performance, visualization, injectability, and endothelialization in cell culture. Femoral artery saccular aneurysm models in rats and in pigs are&#160;created to test stability, efficacy, immune response, endothelialization, and biocompatibility of STH in both ruptured and unruptured SA. Fluoroscopy and computed tomography imaging consistently confirmed SA occlusion without recanalization, migration, or nontarget embolization; STH is&#160;also shown to outperform coil embolization of porcine aneurysms. In pigs with catastrophic bleeding due to SA rupture, STH is&#160;able to achieve instant hemostasis rescuing the pigs in long&#8208;term survival experiments. STH is a promising semisolid iodinated embolic agent that can change the standard of medical practice and potentially save lives.

         <title>Miniaturized Multispectral Detector Derived from Gradient Response Units on Single MAPbX3 Microwire</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optic&#8208;component&#8208;free miniaturized multispectral detector with response&#8208;modulated photodetector units on gradient bandgap MAPbX3 microwire is fabricated to detect and discriminate incident light from 450 to 790&#160;nm, with 25&#160;nm resolution. This work will push multispectral detectors to universal application and provide guidance for forthcoming research in novel functional perovskite devices.








Abstract
Miniaturized multispectral detectors are urgently desired given the unprecedented prosperity of smart optoelectronic chips for integrated functions including communication, imaging, scientific analysis, etc. However, multispectral detectors require complicated prism optics or interference/interferometric filters for spectral recognition, which hampers the miniaturization and their subsequent integration in photonic integrated circuits. In this work, inspired by the advance of computational imaging, optical&#8208;component&#8208;free miniaturized multispectral detector on 4&#160;mm gradient bandgap MAPbX3 microwire with a diameter of 30&#160;&#181;m, is reported. With accurate composition engineering, halide ions in MAPbX3 microwire vary from Cl to I giving in the gradual variation of optical bandgap from 2.96 to 1.68&#160;eV along axis. The sensing units on MAPbX3 microwire offer the response edge ranging from 450 to 790&#160;nm with the responsivity over 20&#160;mA W&#8722;1, &#8722;3dB&#160;width over 450&#160;Hz, LDR of &#8776;60&#160;dB, and a noise current less than &#8776;1.4 &#215; 10&#8722;12 A Hz&#8722;0.5. As a result, the derived miniaturized detector achieves the function of multispectral sensing and discrimination with spectral resolution of &#8776;25&#160;nm and mismatch of &#8776;10&#160;nm. Finally, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept colorful imaging is successfully conducted with the miniaturized multispectral detector to further confirm its application in spectral recognition.

&lt;p&gt;An optic-component-free miniaturized multispectral detector with response-modulated photodetector units on gradient bandgap MAPbX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; microwire is fabricated to detect and discriminate incident light from 450 to 790&#160;nm, with 25&#160;nm resolution. This work will push multispectral detectors to universal application and provide guidance for forthcoming research in novel functional perovskite devices.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miniaturized multispectral detectors are urgently desired given the unprecedented prosperity of smart optoelectronic chips for integrated functions including communication, imaging, scientific analysis, etc. However, multispectral detectors require complicated prism optics or interference/interferometric filters for spectral recognition, which hampers the miniaturization and their subsequent integration in photonic integrated circuits. In this work, inspired by the advance of computational imaging, optical-component-free miniaturized multispectral detector on 4&#160;mm gradient bandgap MAPbX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; microwire with a diameter of 30&#160;&#181;m, is reported. With accurate composition engineering, halide ions in MAPbX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; microwire vary from Cl to I giving in the gradual variation of optical bandgap from 2.96 to 1.68&#160;eV along axis.

As a result, the derived miniaturized detector achieves the function of multispectral sensing and discrimination with spectral resolution of &#8776;25&#160;nm and mismatch of &#8776;10&#160;nm.

         <title>Artificial Nacre with High Toughness Amplification Factor: Residual Stress&#8208;Engineering Sparks Enhanced Extrinsic Toughening Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work illustrates an anti&#8208;intuitive strategy that, with the merit of biomimetic designs, residual stress that is conventionally harmful to ceramics can inversely help improve the fracture toughness of biomimetic ceramics through nanoscale residual stress&#8208;induced platelet strengthening. This provides new insights into the design principles of nacre&#8208;like materials at the bottom level.








Abstract
The high fracture toughness of mollusk nacre is predominantly attributed to the structure&#8208;associated extrinsic mechanisms such as platelet sliding and crack deflection. While the nacre&#8208;mimetic structures are widely adopted in artificial ceramics, the extrinsic mechanisms are often weakened by the relatively low tensile strength of the platelets with a large aspect ratio, which makes the fracture toughness of these materials much lower than expected. Here, it is demonstrated that the fracture toughness of artificial nacre materials with high inorganic contents can be improved by residual stress&#8208;induced platelet strengthening, which can catalyze more effective extrinsic toughening mechanisms that are specific to the nacre&#8208;mimetic structures. Thereby, while the absolute fracture toughness of the materials is not comparable with advanced ceramic&#8208;based composites, the toughness amplification factor of the material reaches 16.1&#160;&#177; 1.1, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art biomimetic ceramics. The results reveal that, with the merit of nacre&#8208;mimetic structural designs, the overall fracture toughness of the artificial nacre can be improved by the platelet strengthening through extrinsic toughening mechanisms, although the intrinsic fracture toughness may decrease at platelet level due to the strengthening. It is anticipated that advanced structural ceramics with exceeding performance can be fabricated through these unconventional strategies.

         <title>Fully Synthetic 3D Fibrous Scaffolds for Stromal Tissues&#8212;Replacement of Animal&#8208;Derived Scaffold Materials Demonstrated by Multilayered Skin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of electrospun fibers and extensive amounts of porogens maximize the porosity of sub&#8208;micrometer fibrous scaffolds. The ensemble of loose fiber networks and appropriately sized pores enable the infiltration with stromal cells and the transformation to biological tissues. Thereby, the limitations of animal&#8208;derived scaffolds like decellularized tissues and hydrogels for tissue engineering applications or advanced therapy medicinal products are overcome.








Abstract
The extracellular matrix (ECM) of soft tissues in vivo has remarkable biological and structural properties. Thereby, the ECM provides mechanical stability while it still can be rearranged via cellular remodeling during tissue maturation or healing processes. However, modern synthetic alternatives fail to provide these key features among basic properties. Synthetic matrices are usually completely degraded or are inert regarding cellular remodeling. Based on a refined electrospinning process, a method is developed to generate synthetic scaffolds with highly porous fibrous structures and enhanced fiber&#8208;to&#8208;fiber distances. Since this approach allows for cell migration, matrix remodeling, and ECM synthesis, the scaffold provides an ideal platform for the generation of soft tissue equivalents. Using this matrix, an electrospun&#8208;based multilayered skin equivalent composed of a stratified epidermis, a dermal compartment, and a subcutis is able to be generated without the use of animal matrix components. The extension of classical dense electrospun scaffolds with high porosities and motile fibers generates a fully synthetic and defined alternative to collagen&#8208;gel&#8208;based tissue models and is a promising system for the construction of tissue equivalents as in vitro models or in vivo implants.

         <title>Multilayer WSe2/MoS2 Heterojunction Phototransistors through Periodically Arrayed Nanopore Structures for Bandgap Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the high exciton binding energy, the efficiency of WSe2/MoS2 heterojunction phototransistors is improved by forming periodic arrayed nanopore structures for bandgap engineering. In particular, enhanced carrier lifetime and increased photocurrent are observed with a modulated charge carrier balance of the WSe2/MoS2 heterojunction phototransistor in the active area upon illumination.








Abstract
While 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising building blocks for various optoelectronic applications, limitations remain for multilayered TMD&#8208;based photodetectors: an indirect bandgap and a short carrier lifetime by strongly bound excitons. Accordingly, multilayered TMDs with a direct bandgap and an enhanced carrier lifetime are required for the development of various optoelectronic devices. Here, periodically arrayed nanopore structures (PANS) are proposed for improving the efficiency of multilayered p&#8208;WSe2/n&#8208;MoS2 phototransistors. Density functional theory calculations as well as photoluminescence and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence measurements are performed to characterize the photodetector figures of merit of multilayered p&#8208;WSe2/n&#8208;MoS2 heterostructures with PANS. The characteristics of the heterojunction devices with PANS reveal an enhanced responsivity and detectivity measured under 405&#160;nm laser excitation, which at 1.7 &#215; 104 A W&#8722;1 and 1.7 &#215; 1013 Jones are almost two orders of magnitude higher than those of pristine devices, 3.6 &#215; 102 A W&#8722;1 and 3.6 &#215; 1011 Jones, respectively. Such enhanced optical properties of WSe2/MoS2 heterojunctions with PANS represent a significant step toward next&#8208;generation optoelectronic applications.

         <title>14&#160;GHz Schottky Diodes Using a p&#8208;Doped Organic Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining asymmetric co&#8208;planar nanogap electrodes with a p&#8208;doped organic polymer semiconductor yields Schottky diodes that are capable of operating at 14&#160;GHz, making them the fastest organic electronic devices reported to date.








Abstract
The low carrier mobility of organic semiconductors and the high parasitic resistance and capacitance often encountered in conventional organic Schottky diodes hinder their deployment in emerging radio frequency (RF) electronics. Here, these limitations are overcome by combining self&#8208;aligned asymmetric nanogap electrodes (&#8776;25&#160;nm) produced by adhesion lithography, with a high mobility organic semiconductor, and RF Schottky diodes able to operate in the 5G frequency spectrum are demonstrated. C16IDT&#8208;BT is used, as the high hole mobility polymer, and the impact of p&#8208;doping on the diode performance is studied. Pristine C16IDT&#8208;BT&#8208;based diodes exhibit maximum intrinsic and extrinsic cutoff frequencies (fC) of &gt;100&#160;and 6&#160;GHz, respectively. This extraordinary performance is attributed to the planar nature of the nanogap channel and the diode's small junction capacitance (&lt;2&#160;pF). Doping of C16IDT&#8208;BT with the molecular p&#8208;dopant C60F48 improves the diode's performance further by reducing the series resistance resulting to intrinsic and extrinsic fC of &gt;100&#160;and &#8776;14&#160;GHz respectively, while the DC output voltage of an RF rectifier circuit increases by a tenfold. Our&#160;work highlights the importance of the planar nanogap architecture and paves the way for the use of organic Schottky diodes in large&#8208;area RF electronics of the future.

Here, these limitations are overcome by combining self-aligned asymmetric nanogap electrodes (&#8776;25&#160;nm) produced by adhesion lithography, with a high mobility organic semiconductor, and RF Schottky diodes able to operate in the 5G frequency spectrum are demonstrated. C&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;IDT-BT is used, as the high hole mobility polymer, and the impact of &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-doping on the diode performance is studied. Pristine C&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;IDT-BT-based diodes exhibit maximum intrinsic and extrinsic cutoff frequencies (&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;) of &amp;gt;100&#160;and 6&#160;GHz, respectively. This extraordinary performance is attributed to the planar nature of the nanogap channel and the diode's small junction capacitance (&amp;lt;2&#160;pF). Doping of C&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;IDT-BT with the molecular &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-dopant C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;48&lt;/sub&gt; improves the diode's performance further by reducing the series resistance resulting to intrinsic and extrinsic &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; of &amp;gt;100&#160;and &#8776;14&#160;GHz respectively, while the DC output voltage of an RF rectifier circuit increases by a tenfold. Our&#160;work highlights the importance of the planar nanogap architecture and paves the way for the use of organic Schottky diodes in large-area RF electronics of the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intracellular Self&#8208;Immolative Polyprodrug with Near&#8208;Infrared Light Guided Accumulation and in Vivo Visualization of Drug Release</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intracellular self&#8208;immolative polyprodrug (PMTO) is developed, wherein the drug accumulation in tumor is significantly enhanced under laser&#8208;triggered mild hyperthermia, and the drug release behavior is real&#8208;time monitored by ratiometric photoacoustic signals. PMTO holds great potential for enhanced targeted chemotherapy efficacy as well as the visualization of drug release in vivo, guiding the clinical medication in cancer treatment.








Abstract
The selective accumulation and real&#8208;time monitoring of drug release at tumor site are the key bottlenecks to the clinical translation of polyprodrug. Herein, an intracellular self&#8208;immolative polyprodrug (PMTO) is exploited, which not only shows the enhanced cellular internalization and selective accumulation in tumor site under the mild hyperthermia triggered by laser irradiation, but also possesses the self&#8208;monitoring drug release ability in vivo. The polyprodrug amphiphiles are synthesized by sequential esterification reaction, and hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) serves as blocking agent. On account of the mild hyperthermia produced by PMTO under the laser irradiation at tumor site, the cell membranous permeability increases, resulting in the enhanced cellular internalization and drug accumulation in tumor. After internalized by cells, the self&#8208;immolative PMTO nanoparticles can release free mitoxantrone (MTO) in intracellular reductive environment, and ratiometric photoacoustic imaging based on distinct signals between MTO and PMTO is presented to trace the drug release in vivo. Finally, this self&#8208;monitoring polyprodrug presents significant tumor suppression efficacy, which exhibits great potential for guiding the clinical medication in cancer treatment.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Memristors Based on Ultrathin 2D Copper Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of ultrathin 2D copper chalcogenides with intrinsic memristive properties is synthesized via van der Waals epitaxy. The fabricated memristors exhibit relatively small switching voltage, fast switching speed, high switching uniformity, and wide operating temperature range, as well as stable retention and switching characteristics, indicating their tangible applications in future electronics.








Abstract
Copper chalcogenides represent a class of materials with unique crystal structures, high electrical conductivity, and earth abundance, and are recognized as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation green electronics. However, their 2D structures and the corresponding electronic properties have rarely been touched. Herein, a series of ultrathin copper chalcogenide nanosheets with thicknesses down to two unit cells are successfully synthesized, including layered Cu2Te, as well as nonlayered CuSe and Cu9S5, via van der Waals epitaxy, and their nonvolatile memristive behavior is investigated for the first time. Benefiting from the highly active Cu ions with low migration barriers, the memristors based on ultrathin 2D copper chalcogenide crystals exhibit relatively small switching voltage (&#8776;0.4&#160;V), fast switching speed, high switching uniformity, and wide operating temperature range (from 80 to 420 K), as well as stable retention and good cyclic endurance. These results demonstrate their tangible applications in future low&#8208;power, cryogenic, and high temperature harsh electronics.

         <title>Boosting Reversibility and Stability of Li Storage in SnO2&#8211;Mo Multilayers: Introduction of Interfacial Oxygen Redistribution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In assembled SnO2&#8211;Mo multilayers with adjustable interfaces and tunable oxygen distribution, the regulating effect of the SnO2/Mo interfaces on the stability and reversibility of conversion between SnO2 and Sn/Li2O is quantified. Mo/SnO2/Mo with boosted charge&#8208;transfer kinetics, realizes a breakthrough performance with high initial Coulombic efficiency of 92.6% and large capacity of 1067 mA h g&#8722;1 retaining &#8776;100% after 700 cycles.








Abstract
Among the promising high&#8208;capacity anode materials, SnO2 represents a classic and important candidate that involves both conversion and alloying reactions toward Li storage. However, the inferior reversibility of conversion reactions usually results in low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE, &#8776;60%), small reversible capacity, and poor cycling stability. Here, it is demonstrated that by carefully designing the interface structure of SnO2&#8211;Mo, a breakthrough comprehensive performance with ultrahigh average ICE of 92.6%, large capacity of 1067 mA h g&#8722;1, and 100% capacity retention after 700 cycles can be realized in a multilayer Mo/SnO2/Mo electrode. Furthermore, high capacity retentions are also achieved in pouch&#8208;type Mo/SnO2/Mo||Li half cells and Mo/SnO2/Mo||LiFePO4 full cells. The amorphous SnO2/Mo interfaces, which are induced by redistribution of oxygen between SnO2 and Mo, can precisely adjust the reversible capacity and cycling stability of the multilayers, while the stable capacities are parabolic with the interfacial density. Theoretical calculations and in/ex situ investigation reveal that oxygen redistribution in SnO2/Mo heterointerfaces boosts Li&#8208;ion transport kinetics by inducing a built&#8208;in electric field and improves the reaction reversibility of SnO2. This work provides a new understanding of interface&#8211;performance relationship of metal&#8211;oxide hybrid electrodes and pivotal guidance for creating high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <dc:description>
The optimized two&#8208;dimensional material (2DM) static random&#8208;access memory designed with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art contact resistance leads to excellent stability and operation speed at the 1&#8208;nm node. Applying the nanosheet gate&#8208;all&#8208;around structure to 2DMs further improves speed and area density, showing the feasible scaling path beyond the Si technology.

Abstract
2D transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, such as MoS2 and WSe2, with adequate bandgaps are promising channel materials for ultrascaled logic transistors. This scalability study of 2D material (2DM)&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) and static random&#8208;access memory (SRAM) cells analyzing the impact of layer thickness reveals that the monolayer 2DM FET with superior electrostatics is beneficial for its ability to mitigate the read&#8211;write conflict in an SRAM cell at scaled technology nodes (1&#8211;2.1&#160;nm). Moreover, the monolayer 2DM SRAM exhibits lower cell read access time and write time than the bilayer and trilayer 2DM SRAM cells at fixed leakage power. This simulation predicts that the optimization of 2DM SRAM designed with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art contact resistance, mobility, and equivalent oxide thickness leads to excellent stability and operation speed at the 1&#8208;nm node. Applying the nanosheet (NS) gate&#8208;all&#8208;around (GAA) structure to 2DM further reduces cell read access time and write time and improves the area density of the SRAM cells, demonstrating a feasible scaling path beyond Si technology using 2DM NSFETs. In addition to the device design, the process challenges for 2DM NSFETs, including the cost&#8208;effective stacking of 2DM layers, formation of electrical contacts, suspended 2DM channels, and GAA structures, are also discussed.

         <title>In&#8208;situ Carbon Corrosion and Cu Leaching as a Strategy for Boosting Oxygen Evolution Reaction in multi&#8208;metal Electrocatalysts</title>

Abstract
The number of active sites and their intrinsic activity are key factors in designing high&#8208;performance catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We report the synthesis, properties and in&#8208;depth characterization of a homogeneous CoNiFeCu multi&#8208;metal catalyst demonstrating that multi&#8208;metal synergistic effects improve the OER kinetics and the intrinsic activity of such catalyst materials. Surface carbon corrosion and in&#8208;situ Cu leaching during the OER lead to an enhanced electrochemically active surface area providing favourable conditions for improved electronic interaction between the constituting metals. After activation using potentiodynamic cycling, the catalyst on a glassy carbon electrode exhibits excellent OER activity with a low overpotential of 291.5&#160;&#177; 0.5&#160;mV at 10 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 43.9 mV&#183;dec&#8722;1. It shows superior stability compared to RuO2 in 1 M KOH, which is even preserved for 120 h at 500 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 in 7 M KOH at 50&#176;C, i.e., close to industrial conditions. We further investigated single particles of this CoNiFeCu multi&#8208;metal catalyst after their placement on nanoelectrodes combined with identical location transmission electron microscopy before and after applying high OER current densities. The improvement in catalytic performance is due to surface carbon corrosion and Cu leaching. The proposed catalysts design strategy combined with the unique single nanoparticle characterization technique contributes to the development and characterization of high&#8208;performance catalysts for electrochemical energy conversion.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Programmable Microgel Lasers for Information Encoding and Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the natural responsivity of active biomaterials, laser information encoding is demonstrated by exploiting enzyme&#8208;bioactive hydrogel materials confined in a microcavity. Tunable lasing wavelengths are achieved by manipulating the biological activity and nanostructures in hydrogel droplets. This study represents the first development of a biologically controlled laser for optical information applications.








Abstract
Microscale laser emissions have emerged as a promising approach for information encoding and anti&#8208;counterfeiting for their feature&#8208;rich spectra and high sensitivity to the surrounding environment. Compared with artificial materials, natural responsive biomaterials enable a higher level of complexity and versatile ways for tailoring optical responses. However, precise control of lasing wavelengths and spatial locations with biomolecules remains a huge challenge. Here, a biologically programmable laser, in which the lasing can be manipulated by biomolecular activities at the nanoscale, is developed. Tunable lasing wavelengths are achieved by exploiting the swelling properties of enzyme&#8208;responsive hydrogel droplets in a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot microcavity. Both experimental and theoretical means demonstrate that inner 3D network structures and external curvature of the hydrogel droplets lead to different lasing thresholds and resonance wavelengths. Finally, inkjet&#8208;printed multiwavelength laser encoding and anti&#8208;counterfeiting are showcased under different scalabilities and environments. Hyperspectral laser images are utilized as an advanced feature for a higher level of security. The biologically encoded laser will provide a new insight into the development of biosynthetic and bioprogrammable laser devices, offering new opportunities for secure communication and smart sensing.

         <title>Designing Angstrom&#8208;Scale Asymmetric MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF Cavities for High Monovalent Ion Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of ion&#8208;selective membrane that possesses an asymmetrical bi&#8208;layer of functionalized metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF) with heterostructured connections between the two MOFs is introduced. The membrane consists of natural asymmetrical nanochannels that exhibit both extraordinary high ionic current rectification and high monovalent ion selectivity.








Abstract
Biological ion channels feature angstrom&#8208;scale asymmetrical cavity structures, which are the key to achieving highly efficient separation and sensing of alkali metal ions from aqueous resources. The clean energy future and lithium&#8208;based energy storage systems heavily rely on highly efficient ionic separations. However, artificial recreation of such a sophisticated biostructure has been technically challenging. Here, a highly tunable design concept is introduced to fabricate monovalent ion&#8208;selective membranes with asymmetric sub&#8208;nanometer pores in which energy barriers are implanted. The energy barriers act against ionic movements, which hold the target ion while facilitating the transport of competing ions. The membrane consists of bilayer metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF), possessing a 6 to 3.4&#8208;angstrom passable cavity structure. The ionic current measurements exhibit an unprecedented ionic current rectification ratio of above 100 with exceptionally high selectivity ratios of 84 and 80 for K+/Li+ and Na+/ Li+, respectively (1.14 Li+ mol m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1). Furthermore, using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics, it is shown that the combined effect of spatial hindrance and nucleophilic entrapment to induce energy surge baffles is responsible for the membrane's ultrahigh selectivity and ion rectification. This work demonstrates a striking advance in developing monovalent ion&#8208;selective channels and has implications in sensing, energy storage, and separation technologies.

         <dc:description>
A stretchable microneedle&#8208;based extended gate field effect transistor for minimally invasive detection of sodium in the interstitial fluids and for real&#8208;time health monitoring is reported. The device exhibits excellent biocompatibility, and on&#8208;body mechanical stability and enables transfer of data via Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things platforms.








Abstract
Sodium is a prominent prognostic biomarker for assessing health status, such as dysnatremia. As of now, detection and monitoring of sodium levels in the human body is carried out by means of laborious and bulky laboratory equipmentand/or by offline analysis of various body fluids. Herein, an innovative stretchable, skin&#8208;conformal and fast&#8208;response microneedle extended&#8208;gate FET biosensor is reported for real&#8208;time detection of sodium in interstitial fluids for minimally invasive health monitoring along with high sensitivity, low limit of detection, excellent biocompatibility, and on&#8208;body mechanical stability. The integration of the reported device with a wireless&#8208;data transmitter and the Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things cloud for real&#8208;time monitoring and long&#8208;term analysis is reported and discussed. This platform would eventually help bringing unlimited possibilities for effecient medical care and accurate clinical decision&#8208;making.

         <title>Orchestrated Yolk&#8211;Shell Nanohybrids Regulate Macrophage Polarization and Dendritic Cell Maturation for Oncotherapy with Augmented Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;designed yolk&#8211;shell nanohybrids Fe3O4@C/MnO2&#8208;PGEA with intrinsic immunomodulatory effects are constructed to realize oncotherapy with augmented antitumor immunity through regulating macrophage polarization and dendritic cell maturation.








Abstract
The protumoral and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments greatly limit the antitumor immune responses of nanoparticles for cancer immunotherapy. Here, the intrinsic immunomodulatory effects of orchestrated nanoparticles and their ability to simultaneously trigger tumor antigen release, thereby reversing immunosuppression and achieving potent antitumor immunity and augmented cancer therapy, are explored. By optimizing both the composition and morphology, a facile strategy is proposed to construct yolk&#8211;shell nanohybrids (Fe3O4@C/MnO2&#8208;PGEA, FCMP). The intrinsic immunomodulatory effects of FCMP are utilized to reprogram macrophages to M1 phenotype and induce the maturation of dendritic cells. In addition, the chemical, magnetic, and optical properties of FCMP contribute to amplified immunogenic cell death induced by multiaugmented chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and synergistic tumor treatment. Taking advantage of the unique yolk&#8211;shell structure, accurate T1&#8208;T2 dual&#8208;mode magnetic resonance imaging can be realized and CDT can be maximized through sufficient exposure of both the Fe3O4 core and MnO2 shell. Potent antitumor effects are found to substantially inhibit the growth of both primary and distant tumors. Furthermore, the strategy can be extended to the synthesis of other yolk&#8211;shell nanohybrids with tailored properties. This work establishes a novel strategy for the fabrication of multifunctional nanoplatforms with yolk&#8208;shell structure for effective cancer therapy with immunomodulation&#8208;enhanced antitumor immunity.

&lt;p&gt;The protumoral and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments greatly limit the antitumor immune responses of nanoparticles for cancer immunotherapy. Here, the intrinsic immunomodulatory effects of orchestrated nanoparticles and their ability to simultaneously trigger tumor antigen release, thereby reversing immunosuppression and achieving potent antitumor immunity and augmented cancer therapy, are explored. By optimizing both the composition and morphology, a facile strategy is proposed to construct yolk&#8211;shell nanohybrids (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@C/MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-PGEA, FCMP). The intrinsic immunomodulatory effects of FCMP are utilized to reprogram macrophages to M1 phenotype and induce the maturation of dendritic cells. In addition, the chemical, magnetic, and optical properties of FCMP contribute to amplified immunogenic cell death induced by multiaugmented chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and synergistic tumor treatment. Taking advantage of the unique yolk&#8211;shell structure, accurate &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dual-mode magnetic resonance imaging can be realized and CDT can be maximized through sufficient exposure of both the Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; core and MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; shell. Potent antitumor effects are found to substantially inhibit the growth of both primary and distant tumors. Furthermore, the strategy can be extended to the synthesis of other yolk&#8211;shell nanohybrids with tailored properties. This work establishes a novel strategy for the fabrication of multifunctional nanoplatforms with yolk-shell structure for effective cancer therapy with immunomodulation-enhanced antitumor immunity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Metallic Heterostructure Based on Ni3N and 2M&#8208;MoS2 for Alkaline Water Electrolysis with Industry&#8208;Compatible Current Density and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel bifunctional electrocatalyst consisting of metallic nickel nitride and monoclinic molybdenum disulfide is designed and fabricated for large&#8208;current alkaline water electrolysis. The constructed water electrolyzer operates at an ultralow cell voltage of 1.644&#160;V@1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;with &#8776;100% current density retention over 300&#160;h, superior to the performance of commercial Pt/C&#9553;RuO2 (2.41&#160;V@1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, 100&#160;h, 58.2%).








Abstract
Alkaline water electrolysis is commercially desirable to realize large&#8208;scale hydrogen production. Although nonprecious catalysts exhibit high electrocatalytic activity at low current density (10&#8211;50&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2), it is still challenging to achieve industrially&#160;required current density over 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;due to inefficient electron transport and competitive adsorption between hydroxyl and water. Herein, the authors design a novel metallic heterostructure based on nickel nitride and monoclinic molybdenum disulfide (Ni3N@2M&#8208;MoS2) for extraordinary water electrolysis. The Ni3N@2M&#8208;MoS2&#160;composite with heterointerface provides two kinds of separated reaction sites to overcome the steric hindrance of competitive hydroxyl/water adsorption. The kinetically decoupled hydroxyl/water adsorption/dissociation and metallic conductivity of Ni3N@2M&#8208;MoS2&#160;enable hydrogen production from Ni3N and oxygen evolution from the heterointerface at large current density. The metallic heterostructure is proved to be imperative for the stabilization and activation of Ni3N@2M&#8208;MoS2, which can efficiently regulate the active electronic states of Ni/N atoms around the Fermi&#8208;level through the charge transfer between the active atoms of Ni3N and Mo&#63743;Mo bonds of 2M&#8208;MoS2&#160;to boost overall water splitting. The Ni3N@2M&#8208;MoS2&#160;incorporated water electrolyzer requires ultralow cell voltage of 1.644&#160;V@1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;with &#8776;100% retention over 300&#160;h, far exceeding the commercial Pt/C&#9553;RuO2 (2.41&#160;V@1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, 100&#160;h, 58.2%).

         <title>Diradical&#8208;Featured Organic Small&#8208;Molecule Photothermal Material with High&#8208;Spin State in Dimers for Ultra&#8208;Broadband Solar Energy Harvesting</title>

         <dc:description>
By taking advantage of the synergetic effect of diradical feature and strong intermolecular interactions, a stable croconium derivative, CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T, with high&#8208;spin state and ultra&#8208;broadband absorption covering 300 to 2000&#160;nm in the aggregated state is obtained. CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T demonstrates highly efficient photothermal conversion promoted by multiple nonradiative decay pathways, being a potential candidate for solar thermoelectric generation.








Abstract
Organic materials with radical characteristics are gaining increasing attention, due to their potential implications in highly efficient utilization of solar energy. Manipulating intermolecular interactions is crucial for tuning radical properties, as well as regulating their absorption bands, and thus improving the photothermal conversion efficiency. Herein, a diradical&#8208;featured organic small&#8208;molecule croconium derivative, CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T, is reported for highly efficient utilization of solar energy. Upon aggregation, CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T exists in dimer form, stabilized by the strong intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, and exhibits a rarely reported high&#8208;spin state. Benefiting from the synergic effects of radical characteristics and strong intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T powder absorbs broadly from 300 to 2000&#160;nm. In&#8208;depth investigations with transient absorption analysis reveal that the strong intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions can promote nonradiative relaxation by accelerating internal conversion and facilitating intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) between dimeric molecules to open up faster internal conversion pathways. Remarkably, CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T powder demonstrates a high photothermal efficiency of 79.5% under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation. By employing CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T as a solar harvester, a CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T&#8208;loaded flexible self&#8208;healing poly(dimethylsiloxane) (H&#8208;PDMS) film, named as H&#8208;PDMS/CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T self&#8208;healing film, is fabricated and employed for solar&#8211;thermal applications. These findings provide a feasible guideline for developing highly efficient diradical&#8208;featured organic photothermal materials.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Materials: The Turning Point of Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advancement of organic photovoltaics has been significantly aided by the emergence of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) materials, and they are also able to satisfy the varied criteria for various types of organic photovoltaic device architectures. Furthermore, the absorption window is the most fundamental criterion for developing novel NIR organic photoelectric materials.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;absorbing organic semiconductors have opened up many exciting opportunities for organic photovoltaic (OPV) research. For example, new chemistries and synthetical methodologies have been developed; especially, the breakthrough Y&#8208;series acceptors, originally invented by our&#160;group, specifically Y1, Y3, and Y6, have contributed immensely to boosting single&#8208;junction solar cell efficiency to around 19%; novel device architectures such as tandem and transparent organic photovoltaics have been realized. The concept of NIR donors/acceptors thus becomes a turning point in the OPV field. Here, the development of NIR&#8208;absorbing materials for OPVs is reviewed. According to the low&#8208;energy absorption window, here, NIR photovoltaic materials (p&#8208;type (polymers) and n&#8208;type (fullerene and nonfullerene)) are classified into four categories: 700&#8211;800 nm, 800&#8211;900 nm, 900&#8211;1000 nm, and greater than 1000&#160;nm. Each subsection covers the design, synthesis, and utilization of various types of donor (D) and acceptor (A) units. The structure&#8211;property relationship between various kinds of D, A units and absorption window are constructed to satisfy requirements for different applications. Subsequently, a variety of applications realized by NIR materials, including transparent OPVs, tandem OPVs, photodetectors, are presented. Finally, challenges and future development of novel NIR materials for the next&#8208;generation organic photovoltaics and beyond are discussed.

         <title>Synchrotron X&#8208;ray Spectroscopic Investigations of In&#8208;Situ&#8208;Formed Alloy Anodes for Magnesium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanostructured bismuth anode is constructed through an in situ electrochemical conversion reaction from layered bismuth selenide. The in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed bismuth anode with Bi nanocrystals exhibits short Mg2+ diffusion length and high ion diffusivity. The Li+&#8208;driven conversion reaction and magnesium alloying reaction in such Bi&#8208;based electrodes are systematically investigated by operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and ex situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy.








Abstract
Magnesium batteries present high volumetric energy density and dendrite&#8208;free deposition of Mg, drawing wide attention in energy&#8208;storage devices.

&lt;p&gt;A nanostructured bismuth anode is constructed through an in situ electrochemical conversion reaction from layered bismuth selenide. The in-situ-formed bismuth anode with Bi nanocrystals exhibits short Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion length and high ion diffusivity.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnesium batteries present high volumetric energy density and dendrite-free deposition of Mg, drawing wide attention in energy-storage devices. However, their further development remains stagnated due to relevant interfacial issues between the Mg anode and the electrolyte and sluggish solid-state diffusion kinetics of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. Herein, an in situ conversion chemistry to construct a nanostructured Bi anode from bismuth selenide driven by Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is proposed. Through the combination of operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction, ex situ synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and comprehensive electrochemical tests, it is demonstrated that the nanosize of the in-situ-formed Bi crystals contributes to the fast Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion kinetics and highly efficient Mg&#8211;Bi alloingy/de-alloying. The resultant Bi anodes exhibit superior long-term cycling stability with over 600 cycles under a high current density of 1.0 A g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. This work provides a new approach to construct alloy anode and paves the way for exploring novel electrode materials for magnesium batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Achieving Ultimate Narrowband and Ultrapure Blue Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Polycyclo&#8208;Heteraborin Multi&#8208;Resonance Delayed&#8208;Fluorescence Emitters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;efficiency ultrapure blue delayed&#8208;fluorescence materials are produced by the strategic doping of multiple boron, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms into the fused polycyclo&#8208;heteraborin &#960;&#8208;system. These new fluorophores allow organic light&#8208;emitting diodes to demonstrate ideal narrowband and ultrapure blue electroluminescence, meeting the requirements for modern ultrahigh&#8208;definition displays.








Abstract
To achieve an ultimate wide color gamut for ultrahigh&#8208;definition displays, there is great demand for the development of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) enabling monochromatic, ultrapure blue electroluminescence (EL). Herein, high&#8208;efficiency and ultrapure blue OLEDs based on polycyclo&#8208;heteraborin multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials, BOBO&#8208;Z, BOBS&#8208;Z, and BSBS&#8208;Z, are reported. The key to the design of the present luminophores is the exquisite combination and interplay of multiple boron, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur heteroatoms embedded in a fused polycyclic &#960;&#8208;system. Comprehensive photophysical and computational investigations of this family of MR&#8208;TADF materials reveal that the systematic implementation of chalcogen (oxygen and sulfur) atoms can finely modulate the emission color while maintaining a narrow bandwidth, as well as the spin&#8208;flipping rates between the excited singlet and triplet states. Consequently, OLEDs based on BOBO&#8208;Z, BOBS&#8208;Z, and BSBS&#8208;Z demonstrate narrowband and ultrapure blue EL emission, with peaks at 445&#8211;463&#160;nm and full width at half maxima of 18&#8211;23&#160;nm, leading to Commission Internationale de l'&#201;clairage&#8208;y coordinates in the range of 0.04&#8211;0.08. Particularly, for OLEDs incorporating sulfur&#8208;doped BOBS&#8208;Z and BSBS&#8208;Z, notably high maximum external EL quantum efficiencies of 26.9% and 26.8%, respectively, and small efficiency roll&#8208;offs are achieved concurrently.

         <title>Two Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks: From Synthetic Strategies to Advanced optical&#8208;electrical&#8208;magnetic Functionalities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), an emerging class of organic crystalline polymers with highly oriented structures and permanent porosity, can adopt two&#8208;dimensional (2D) or three&#8208;dimensional (3D) architectures depending on the different topological diagrams of the monomers. Notably, 2D COFs have particularly gained much attention due to the extraordinary merits of their extended in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;conjugation and topologically ordered columnar &#960;&#8208;arrays. These properties together with high crystallinity, large surface area and tunable porosity distinguish 2D COFs as an ideal candidate for the fabrication of functional materials. Herein, this review surveys the recent research advances in 2D COFs with special emphasis on the preparation of 2D COF powders, single crystals, and thin films, as well as their advanced optical, electrical, and magnetic functionalities. Some challenging issues and potential research outlook for 2D COFs are also provided for promoting their development in terms of structure, synthesis, and functionalities.

         <title>Andreev Interference in the Surface Accumulation Layer of Half&#8208;Shell InAsSb/Al Hybrid Nanowires</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Understanding the spatial distribution of charge carriers in III&#8208;V nanowires proximity coupled to superconductors is important for the design and interpretation of experiments based on hybrid quantum devices. In this letter, the gate&#8208;dependent surface accumulation layer of half&#8208;shell InAsSb/Al nanowires was&#160;studied by means of Andreev interference in a parallel magnetic field. Both uniform hybrid nanowires and devices featuring a short Josephson junction fabricated by shadow lithography, exhibited periodic modulation of the switching current. The period corresponds to a flux quantum through the nanowire diameter and is consistent with Andreev bound states occupying a cylindrical surface accumulation layer. The spatial distribution was&#160;tunable by a gate potential as expected from electrostatic models.

         <title>Multifunctional Biomimetic Nanovaccines Based on Photothermal and Weak&#8208;Immunostimulatory Nanoparticulate Cores for the Immunotherapy of Solid Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photothermal porous silicon@Au nanocomposites are used as particular cores to be coated by cancer cell membranes to construct biomimetic nanovaccine with good biosafety. The developed nanovaccine shows a good prophylactic and synergistic photothermal&#8211;immunotherapeutic efficacy on the occurrence, growth, and metastasis of solid tumors, via the recruitment and activation of immune&#8208;related cells to elicit antitumor immunity.








Abstract
An alternative strategy of choosing photothermal and weak&#8208;immunostimulatory porous silicon@Au nanocomposites as particulate cores to prepare a biomimetic nanovaccine is reported to improve its biosafety and immunotherapeutic efficacy for solid tumors. A quantitative analysis method is used to calculate the loading amount of cancer cell membranes onto porous silicon@Au nanocomposites. Assisted with foreign&#8208;body responses, these exogenous nanoparticulate cores with weak immunostimulatory effect can still efficiently deliver cancer cell membranes into dendritic cells to activate them and the downstream antitumor immunity, resulting in no occurrence of solid tumors and the survival of all immunized mice during 55 day observation. In addition, this nanovaccine, as a photothermal therapeutic agent, synergized with additional immunotherapies can significantly inhibit the growth and metastasis of established solid tumors, via the initiation of the antitumor immune responses in the body and the reversion of their immunosuppressive microenvironments. Considering the versatile surface engineering of porous silicon nanoparticles, the strategy developed here is beneficial to construct multifunctional nanovaccines with better biosafety and more diagnosis or therapeutic modalities against the occurrence, recurrence, or metastasis of solid tumors in future clinical practice.

         <title>MXenes for Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Energy&#8208;harvesting modules play an increasingly important role in the development of autonomous self&#8208;powered microelectronic devices. MXenes (i.e., two&#8208;dimensional transition metal carbide/nitride) have recently emerged as promising candidates for energy applications due to their excellent electronic conductivity, large specific surface area, and tunable properties. In this review, we present a perspective on using MXenes to harvest energy from various sources in the environment. First, we systematically introduce the characteristics of MXenes that facilitate energy capturing and summarize the preparation strategies of MXenes and their derived nanostructures tailored towards such applications. Subsequently, we discuss the harvesting mechanism of different energy sources (e.g., solar energy, thermoelectric energy, triboelectric energy, piezoelectric energy, salinity gradient energy, electrokinetic energy, ultrasound energy, and humidity energy). Then we introduce the recent progress of MXene&#8208;based nanostructures in energy harvesting, as well as their applications. Finally, we present our opinions on the existing challenges and future directions of MXene&#8208;based nanostructure for energy harvesting.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy-harvesting modules play an increasingly important role in the development of autonomous self-powered microelectronic devices. MXenes (i.e., two-dimensional transition metal carbide/nitride) have recently emerged as promising candidates for energy applications due to their excellent electronic conductivity, large specific surface area, and tunable properties. In this review, we present a perspective on using MXenes to harvest energy from various sources in the environment. First, we systematically introduce the characteristics of MXenes that facilitate energy capturing and summarize the preparation strategies of MXenes and their derived nanostructures tailored towards such applications. Subsequently, we discuss the harvesting mechanism of different energy sources (e.g., solar energy, thermoelectric energy, triboelectric energy, piezoelectric energy, salinity gradient energy, electrokinetic energy, ultrasound energy, and humidity energy). Then we introduce the recent progress of MXene-based nanostructures in energy harvesting, as well as their applications. Finally, we present our opinions on the existing challenges and future directions of MXene-based nanostructure for energy harvesting.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Reconstructable Uterus&#8208;Derived Materials for Uterus Recovery toward Efficient Live Births</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reconstructable uterus&#8208;derived materials (RUMs) with different states and shapes can be designed and fabricated, achieving highly efficient live births in rats with severe uterine injury. The RUMs can effectively prevent intrauterine adhesion, and promote endometrial regeneration and muscle collagen reconstruction, as well as accelerate wound healing by constructing a physical barrier and secreting cytokines, allowing efficient uterus recovery and live births.








Abstract
Uterine factor infertility is increasingly common in modern society and has severely affected human life and health. However, the existing biomaterial scaffold&#8208;mediated systems remain limited in efficient uterus recovery, leading to low pregnancy rate and live births. Here, reconstructable uterus&#8208;derived materials (RUMs) are demonstrated by combining uterus&#8208;derived extracellular matrix and seeded chorionic villi mesenchymal stem cells for uterus recovery, achieving highly efficient live births in rats with severe uterine injury. The RUMs can be designed into different states (such as, liquid RUMs and solid RUMs) and shapes (such as, cuboid, triangular&#8208;prism, and cube) in terms of requirements. The RUMs can effectively prevent intrauterine adhesion, and promote endometrial regeneration and muscle collagen reconstruction, as well as, accelerate wound healing by constructing a physical barrier and secreting cytokines, allowing efficient uterus recovery. The injured uterus nearly achieves complete recovery after treating with the RUMs and has normal pregnancies for supporting fetal development and live births, similar to the normal rats. The study provides a regenerative medicine therapeutics for uterine factor infertility.

         <title>Multiferroic&#8208;Enabled Magnetic&#8208;Excitons in 2D Quantum&#8208;Entangled Van der Waals Antiferromagnet NiI2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum&#8208;entangled magnetic excitons develop in a triangular multiferroic NiI2 when it goes through a second phase transition at low temperatures. In this graph of optical absorption data, the bright regions indicate where two exciton&#8208;related peaks appear below the second magnetic phase transition as indicated by the dashed line. The many&#8208;body calculations show that this exciton arises from a transition between two quantum&#8208;entangled states of Zhang&#8211;Rice triplet and Zhang&#8211;Rice singlet states.








Abstract
Matter&#8211;light interaction is at the center of diverse research fields from quantum optics to condensed matter physics, opening new fields like laser physics. A magnetic exciton is one such rare example found in magnetic insulators. However, it is relatively rare to observe that external variables control matter&#8208;light interaction. Here, it is reported that the broken inversion symmetry of multiferroicity can act as an external knob enabling magnetic excitons in the van der Waals antiferromagnet NiI2. It is further discovered that this magnetic exciton arises from a transition between Zhang&#8211;Rice&#8208;triplet and Zhang&#8211;Rice&#8208;singlet fundamentally quantum&#8208;entangled states. This quantum entanglement produces an ultrasharp optical exciton peak at 1.384&#160;eV with a 5 meV linewidth. The work demonstrates that NiI2 is 2D magnetically ordered with an intrinsically quantum&#8208;entangled ground state.

         <title>Monolithic Perovskite&#8208;silicon Tandem Solar cells: from the Lab to Fab?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
This review focuses on monolithic 2&#8208;terminal perovskite&#8208;silicon tandem solar cells and discusses key scientific and technological challenges to address in view of an industrial implementation of this technology. We start by examining the different crystalline silicon (c&#8208;Si) technologies suitable for pairing with perovskites, followed by reviewing recent developments in the field of monolithic 2&#8208;terminal perovskite&#8208;silicon tandems. Factors limiting the power conversion efficiency of these tandem devices are then evaluated, before discussing pathways to achieve an efficiency of &gt;32%,&#160;a value that small&#8208;scale devices will likely need to achieve to make tandems competitive. Aspects related to the upscaling of these device active areas to industry&#8208;relevant ones are reviewed, followed by a short discussion on module integration aspects. The review then focuses on stability issues, likely the most challenging task that will eventually determine the economic viability of this technology. The final part of this review discusses alternative monolithic perovskite&#8208;silicon tandem designs. Finally, we highlight key areas of research that should be addressed to bring this technology from the lab to the fab.

         <title>Spiral growth of adlayer graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The morphology of as&#8208;grown graphene in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) experiments is sensitive to the reaction environment. Understanding the mechanism of formation of different graphene morphologies is essential to achieve controlled graphene CVD growth. Here we report the growth and formation mechanism of adlayer graphene spirals. An adlayer graphene spiral is formed by fast propagation of the tips of spiral arms along the edge of the first graphene layer. The driving force to form spirals is the limited availability of carbon diffusing from the Cu surface through the edge of the first graphene layer. In addition, we find that graphene onions are formed by overlapping graphene spirals with clockwise and anticlockwise arms. Based on these features, we demonstrate a kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) method using which we successfully reproduced all the observed graphene spiral structures at the atomic level. This study thus unravels the hither&#8208;to unresolved mechanism of graphene onion growth and paves the way to the controllable growth of few&#8208;layer graphene by increasing the carbon supply at the edge of the first layer graphene.

         <title>Constructing Monolithic Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cell with Efficiency of 22.0% via Reduced Open&#8208;circuit Voltage Loss and Broadened Absorption Spectra</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Combining the high stability under UV light of the wide bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) and the broad near&#8208;infrared absorption spectra of the narrow bandgap (NBG) organic solar cells (OSCs), the perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (TSCs) with the WBG pero&#8208;SC as front cell and the NBG OSC as rear cell have attracted attention recently. However, the photovoltaic performance of the perovskite/organic TSCs needs to be further improved. Herein, we reduce non&#8208;radiative charge recombination loss through bulk defect passivation in the WBG pero&#8208;SC front subcell, and broaden the range of absorption spectra of the NBG OSC rear cell, for improving photovoltaic performance of the TSCs. For the WBG pero&#8208;SCs, an organic cation chloro&#8208;formamidinium (ClFA+) is introduced into FA0.6MA0.4Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 to passivate the bulk defects in the perovskite film and the WBG pero&#8208;SC displays high open circuit voltage of 1.25&#160;V and high fill factor of 83.0%, which is among the highest values reported for the WBG pero&#8208;SCs with bandgap over 1.73&#160;eV. For the NBG OSCs, a new infrared&#8208;absorbing organic small molecule acceptor BTPV&#8208;4Cl&#8208;eC9 is designed and synthesized to broaden the absorption spectra. Then, a monolithic perovskite/organic TSC is fabricated with the WBG pero&#8208;SC as the front cell and the NBG OSC as the rear cell, and the TSC demonstrates high power conversion efficiency up to 22.0% with little hysteresis and good operating stability under UV light. The results indicate that the perovskite/organic TSC is a promising technology for future commercialization of the high performance and stable solar cells.

         <title>Co&#8208;Delivery of Precisely Prescribed Multi&#8208;Prodrug Combination by Engineered Nanocarrier Enables Efficient Individualized Cancer Chemotherapy</title>

Abstract
The limited anticancer drug library and the frequent occurrence of drug resistance have driven monotherapy&#8208;based cancer therapy into a difficult situation. Considering the formidable process of new drug discovery, combination therapy using currently available drugs is a potential alternative. Nevertheless, the barrier between in vitro combination screening and precise in vivo delivery remains insurmountable in the current free drug&#8208; or nanoparticle&#8208;based combination therapy, which substantially hinders the application of combination therapy. Herein, we proposed a novel, precise drug delivery strategy to realize efficient and individualized combination therapy. We engineered nano&#8208;medicine using a microfluidics&#8208;based mixer by combining rationally designed polymeric prodrugs of three commercial chemotherapeutics and a cascade&#8208;responsive block copolymer; the nano&#8208;medicine possessed ratiometric drug loading and synchronized drug release. In addition to quantitative drug loading and precisely controlled drug combination, consistent nano&#8208;properties of these nanoparticles made their in vivo fate predictable. Consequently, tumor growth and metastasis could be effectively inhibited by precisely prescribed nanoparticles derived from in vitro combination screening. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study clearly revealed the feasibility of overcoming the current drug library limitations through precise delivery of any predetermined drug combination, facilitating translational research of individualized combination therapy.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Targeted Lipid Nanotherapeutic Boost for Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Chemo&#8208;immunotherapy is a combination of &#8220;standard&#8208;of&#8208;care&#8221; chemotherapy with immunotherapy and it is considered the most advanced therapeutic modality for various types of cancers. However, many cancer patients still poorly respond to current regimen of chemo&#8208;immunotherapy and suggest nanotherapeutics as a boosting agent. Recently, heme oxygenase&#8208;1 (HO1) was shown to act as an immunotherapeutic molecule in tumor myeloid cells, in addition to general chemoresistance function in cancer cells suggesting that HO1&#8208;targeted therapeutics could become a novel, optimal strategy for boosting chemo&#8208;immunotherapy in the clinic. Currently the available HO1&#8208;inhibitors demonstrate serious adverse effects in clinical use. Herein, tumor myeloid cell&#8208; and cancer cell&#8208; dual targeted HO1&#8208;inhibiting lipid nanotherapeutic boost (T&#8208;iLNTB) is developed using RNAi loaded lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). T&#8208;iLNTB&#8208;mediated HO1 inhibition sensitizes cancer cells to &#8220;standard&#8208;of&#8208;care&#8221; chemotherapeutics by increasing immunogenic cell death, and directly reprograms tumor myeloid cells with distinguished phenotype. Furthermore, tumor myeloid cell reprogramming by T&#8208;iLNTB induces CD8+ cytotoxic T cell recruitment, which drives &#8220;Cold&#8208;to&#8208;Hot&#8221; transition and correlates with improved responsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibitor in combination therapy. Finally, ex vivo study proves that HO1&#8208;inhibition directly affects tumor macrophage differentiation. This study demonstrates the potential of T&#8208;iLNTB as a novel therapeutic modality for boosting chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.

&lt;p&gt;Chemo-immunotherapy is a combination of &#8220;standard-of-care&#8221; chemotherapy with immunotherapy and it is considered the most advanced therapeutic modality for various types of cancers. However, many cancer patients still poorly respond to current regimen of chemo-immunotherapy and suggest nanotherapeutics as a boosting agent. Recently, heme oxygenase-1 (HO1) was shown to act as an immunotherapeutic molecule in tumor myeloid cells, in addition to general chemoresistance function in cancer cells suggesting that HO1-targeted therapeutics could become a novel, optimal strategy for boosting chemo-immunotherapy in the clinic. Currently the available HO1-inhibitors demonstrate serious adverse effects in clinical use. Herein, tumor myeloid cell- and cancer cell- dual targeted HO1-inhibiting lipid nanotherapeutic boost (T-iLNTB) is developed using RNAi loaded lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). T-iLNTB-mediated HO1 inhibition sensitizes cancer cells to &#8220;standard-of-care&#8221; chemotherapeutics by increasing immunogenic cell death, and directly reprograms tumor myeloid cells with distinguished phenotype.

         <title>Immuno&#8208;Engineered Nanodecoys for the Multi&#8208;Target Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Treatment of Autoimmune Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Over&#8208;activated T cells and over&#8208;produced pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines form a self&#8208;amplified signaling loop to continuously exacerbate the dysregulated inflammatory response and propel the progression of autoimmune diseases (AIDs). Herein, immuno&#8208;engineered nanodecoys (NDs) based on poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) nanoparticles (PLGA NPs) coated with PD&#8208;L1&#8208;expressing macrophage membrane (PRM) were developed to mediate multi&#8208;target interruption of the self&#8208;promoted inflammatory cascade in AIDs. PRM collected from IFN&#8208;&#947;&#8208;treated RAW 264.7 cells possessed elevated surface levels of adhesion molecule receptors and pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine receptors, and thus systemically administered PRM NDs afforded higher accumulation level in the inflamed tissues and stronger scavenging efficiency toward multiple pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines. More importantly, IFN&#8208;&#947; treatment induced remarkable PD&#8208;L1 expression on PRM, thereby allowing PRM NDs to bind mPD&#8208;1 on CD4+ T cell surfaces or neutralize free sPD&#8208;1, which reconstructed the PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 inhibitory axis to suppress CD4+ T cell activation and restore immune tolerance. As such, PRM NDs provoked potent and cooperative anti&#8208;inflammatory and immune&#8208;suppressive efficacies to alleviate autoimmune damages in Zymosan A&#8208;induced arthritis mice and dextran sulfate sodium&#8208;induced ulcerative colitis mice. This study provides an enlightened example for the immuno&#8208;engineering of cell membrane&#8208;based NDs, rendering promising implications into the treatment of AIDs via multi&#8208;target immune&#8208;modulation.

         <title>Toward Exotic Layered Materials: 2D Cuprous Iodide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Only a few dozen 2D crystals have been successfully prepared, though many more&#8212;including metal iodides&#8212;are predicted to exist. A major reason for this disparity is their instability under ambient conditions. A wet&#8208;chemical method to synthesize 2D&#8208;CuI, stabilizing it by graphene encapsulation in a one&#8208;step process, is designed, and its chemical structure is imaged.








Abstract
Heterostructures composed of 2D materials are already opening many new possibilities in such fields of technology as electronics and magnonics, but far more could be achieved if the number and diversity of 2D materials were&#160;increased. So far, only a few dozen 2D crystals have been extracted from materials that exhibit a layered phase in ambient conditions, omitting entirely the large number of layered materials that may exist at other temperatures and pressures. This work demonstrates how such structures can be stabilized in 2D van der Waals (vdw) stacks under room temperature via growing them directly in graphene encapsulation by using graphene oxide as the template material. Specifically, an ambient stable 2D structure of copper and iodine, a material that normally only occurs in layered form at elevated temperatures between 645 and 675&#160;K, is produced. The results establish a simple route to the production of more exotic phases of materials that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to stabilize for experiments in&#160;ambient.

&lt;p&gt;Heterostructures composed of 2D materials are already opening many new possibilities in such fields of technology as electronics and magnonics, but far more could be achieved if the number and diversity of 2D materials were&#160;increased. So far, only a few dozen 2D crystals have been extracted from materials that exhibit a layered phase in ambient conditions, omitting entirely the large number of layered materials that may exist at other temperatures and pressures. This work demonstrates how such structures can be stabilized in 2D van der Waals (vdw) stacks under room temperature via growing them directly in graphene encapsulation by using graphene oxide as the template material. Specifically, an ambient stable 2D structure of copper and iodine, a material that normally only occurs in layered form at elevated temperatures between 645 and 675&#160;K, is produced. The results establish a simple route to the production of more exotic phases of materials that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to stabilize for experiments in&#160;ambient.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Retina&#8208;Inspired Color&#8208;Cognitive Learning via Chromatically Controllable Mixed Quantum Dot Synaptic Transistor Arrays</title>

Abstract
Artificial photonic synapses are emerging as a promising implementation to emulate the human visual cognitive system by consolidating a series of processes for sensing and memorizing visual information into one system. In particular, mimicking retinal functions such as multispectral color perception and controllable nonvolatility is important for realizing artificial visual systems. However, many studies to date have focused on monochromatic light&#8208;based photonic synapses, and thus, the emulation of color discrimination capability remains an important challenge for visual intelligence. Here, we propose an artificial multispectral color recognition system by employing heterojunction photosynaptic transistors consisting of ratio&#8208;controllable mixed quantum dot (mixed QD; M&#8208;QD) photoabsorbers and metal&#8208;oxide semiconducting channels. The biological photoreceptor inspires M&#8208;QD photoabsorbers with a precisely designed red (R), green (G), and blue (B)&#8208;QD ratio, enabling full&#8208;range visible color recognition with high photo&#8208;to&#8208;electric conversion efficiency. In addition, adjustable synaptic plasticity by modulating gate bias allows multiple nonvolatile&#8208;to&#8208;volatile memory conversion, leading to chromatic control in the artificial photonic synapse. To ensure the viability of the developed proof of concept, we demonstrate a 7&#215;7 pixelated photonic synapse array capable of performing outstanding color image recognition based on adjustable wavelength&#8208;dependent volatility conversion.

         <title>Wearable Pressure Sensors for Pulse Wave Monitoring</title>

         <dc:description>
Abstract
Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of death worldwide. The rapid development of flexible sensing technologies and wearable pulse pressure sensors have attracted keen research interest and have been widely used for long&#8208;term and real&#8208;time cardiovascular status monitoring. Owing to their compelling characteristics, including light weight, cost&#8208;effectiveness, wear comfort, and high sensitivity to pulse pressures, physiological pulse waveforms can be precisely and continuously monitored by flexible pulse sensors for wearable health monitoring. In this review, we present an overview of wearable pressure sensors for human pulse wave monitoring, with a focus on the transduction mechanism, microengineering structures, and related applications in pulse wave monitoring and cardiovascular condition assessment. We first outline the conceptualizations and methods for the acquisition of physiological and pathological information related to the cardiovascular system. The biomechanics of arterial pulse waves and the working mechanism of various wearable pressure sensors, including triboelectric, piezoelectric, magnetoelastic, piezoresistive, capacitive, and optical sensors, are also subject to systematic debate. We then summarize the exemplary applications of pulse wave measurement based on microengineering structured devices. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the opportunities and challenges that wearable pulse pressure sensors face, as well as their potential as a wearable intelligent system for personalized healthcare.

Abstract
Patterned surfaces can enhance the sensitivity of laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry by segregating and concentrating analytes, but their fabrication can be challenging. Here, we describe a simple method to fabricate substrates patterned with micron&#8208;scale wells that yield more accurate and sensitive mass spectrometry measurements compared to flat surfaces. The wells can also concentrate and localize cells and beads for cell&#8208;based assays.

         <title>Magnetic Skyrmions in a Thickness Tunable 2D Ferromagnet from a Defect Driven Dzyaloshinskii&#8208;Moriya Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
There is considerable interest in van der Waals (vdW) materials as potential hosts for chiral skyrmionic spin textures. Of particular interest is the ferromagnetic, metallic compound Fe3GeTe2 (FGT), which has a comparatively high Curie temperature (150&#8208;220 K). Several recent studies have reported the observation of chiral N&#233;el skyrmions in this compound, which is inconsistent with its presumed centrosymmetric structure. Here we report the observation of N&#233;el type skyrmions in single crystals of FGT via Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM). We show from detailed X&#8208;ray diffraction structure analysis that FGT lacks an inversion symmetry as a result of an asymmetric distribution of Fe vacancies. This vacancy&#8208;induced breaking of the inversion symmetry of this compound is a surprising and novel observation and is a prerequisite for a Dzyaloshinskii&#8208;Moriya vector exchange interaction which accounts for the chiral N&#233;el skyrmion phase. This phenomenon is likely to be common to many two&#8208;dimensional (2D) vdW materials and suggests a path to the preparation of many such acentric compounds. Furthermore, we find that the skyrmion size in FGT is strongly dependent on its thickness: the skyrmion size increases from &#8764;100 to &#8764;750&#160;nm as the thickness of the lamella is increased from &#8764;90&#160;nm to &#8764;2&#160;&#956;m. This extreme size tunability is a feature common to many low symmetry ferro&#8208; and ferri&#8208;magnetic compounds.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Associated Immune&#8208;Cell&#8208;Mediated Tumor&#8208;Targeting Mechanism with NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence Imaging</title>

Cyanine&#8208;based SH1 is reported as a structure&#8208;inherent tumor&#8208;targeting (SITT) fluorophore without targeting&#8208;ligands. A tumor&#8208;associated immune&#8208;cell&#8208;mediated targeting mechanism for SITT strategy is suggested, which is confirmed via in vitro flow cytometry and in vivo second near&#8208;infrared spectral window imaging. SH1 provides ubiquitous tumor targetability in pancreatic, breast, and lung cancer models with a high tumor&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio.








Abstract
The strategy of structure&#8208;inherent tumor targeting (SITT) with cyanine&#8208;based fluorophores is receiving more attention because no chemical conjugation of targeting moieties is required. However, the targeting mechanism behind SITT has not yet been well explained. Here, it is demonstrated that heptamethine&#8208;cyanine&#8208;based fluorophores possess not only targetability of tumor microenvironments without the need for additional targeting ligands but also second near&#8208;infrared spectral window (NIR&#8208;II) imaging capabilities, i.e., minimum scattering and ultralow autofluorescence. The new SITT mechanism suggests that bone&#8208;marrow&#8208;derived and/or tissue&#8208;resident/tumor&#8208;associated immune cells can be a principal target for cancer detection due to their abundance in tumoral tissues. Among the tested, SH1 provides ubiquitous tumor targetability and a high tumor&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (TBR) ranging from 9.5 to 47 in pancreatic, breast, and lung cancer mouse models upon a single bolus intravenous injection. Furthermore, SH1 can be used to detect small cancerous tissues smaller than 2&#8239;mm in diameter in orthotopic lung cancer models. Thus, SH1 could be a promising cancer&#8208;targeting agent and have a bright future for intraoperative optical imaging and image&#8208;guided cancer surgery.

SH1 provides ubiquitous tumor targetability in pancreatic, breast, and lung cancer models with a high tumor-to-background ratio.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategy of structure-inherent tumor targeting (SITT) with cyanine-based fluorophores is receiving more attention because no chemical conjugation of targeting moieties is required. However, the targeting mechanism behind SITT has not yet been well explained. Here, it is demonstrated that heptamethine-cyanine-based fluorophores possess not only targetability of tumor microenvironments without the need for additional targeting ligands but also second near-infrared spectral window (NIR-II) imaging capabilities, i.e., minimum scattering and ultralow autofluorescence. The new SITT mechanism suggests that bone-marrow-derived and/or tissue-resident/tumor-associated immune cells can be a principal target for cancer detection due to their abundance in tumoral tissues. Among the tested, SH1 provides ubiquitous tumor targetability and a high tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) ranging from 9.5 to 47 in pancreatic, breast, and lung cancer mouse models upon a single bolus intravenous injection. Furthermore, SH1 can be used to detect small cancerous tissues smaller than 2&#8239;mm in diameter in orthotopic lung cancer models. Thus, SH1 could be a promising cancer-targeting agent and have a bright future for intraoperative optical imaging and image-guided cancer surgery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting Cancer Immunotherapy via the Convenient A2AR Inhibition Using a Tunable Nanocatalyst with Light&#8208;Enhanced Activity</title>

A well&#8208;tailored nanoreactor is designed to achieve tumor&#8208;activated oxygen generation and near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;guided/accelerated oxygen supplementation for tumor&#8208;specific A2A adenosine receptor (A2AR) inhibition to prime antitumor T cell immunity. The photo&#8208;modulated nanoreactor not only brakes the shackles of immunosuppression but also enhances the anti&#8208;PD1 immunotherapy.








Abstract
Blockade of A2A adenosine receptors (A2AR)&#8208;adenosinergic signaling shows high potency to mobilize antitumor immunity for its in&#8208;depth involvement in immune regulation of nearly all immune cells. Available A2AR inhibition strategies are mainly based on small molecules or proteins inhibitors, yet are limited by the non&#8208;specific operation as well as the off&#8208;target toxicity. Herein, the first effort to design a convenient tumor&#8208;specific A2AR inhibition strategy to improve antitumor immune responses via the spatiotemporally controlled oxygen supply by virtue of a versatile photo&#8208;modulated nanoreactor is reported on. This nanoreactor, consisting of a catalase&#8208;mimicking shell (Pt nanocatalyst) and a photothermal core (polydopamine), is rationally designed for achieving the near&#8208;infrared radiation (NIR)&#8208;guided/accelerated oxygen supplementation on tumor site, and for relieving the A2AR&#8208;mediated immunosuppression without toxicity concern. Meanwhile, the NIR light could also mediate the direct photothermal ablation of tumor, and elicit immunogenic cell deaths to boost antitumor immunity. In a poorly immunogenic breast cancer model, the intravenous injection of the nanoreactor leads to the improved immune response with an increased animal survival rate, and achieves the long&#8208;term immunological memory effect against tumor recurrence as well as rechallenge. This convenient nanoreactor&#8208;stimulated A2AR inhibition approach provides a versatile promising paradigm for improving these existing immunotherapies.

         <title>Boosting Charge Transport in BiVO4 Photoanode for Solar Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of hole polarons is the main cause of the slow migration of hole carriers to the surface for BiVO4 photoanode, which is localized at the BiO8 unit cell. A deep eutectic solvent that can leach Bi atoms from the BiVO4 crystal to selectively destroy the unit structure is reported. After losing Bi atoms from the BiVO4 crystal, the hole carriers will be in a more chainless state and can reach the surface with a faster migration speed to participate in the water oxidation.








Abstract
The ability to regulate charge separation is pivotal for obtaining high efficiency of any photoelectrode used for solar fuel production. Vacancy engineering for metal oxide semiconductor photoelectrode is a major strategy but has faced a formidable challenge in bulk charge transport because of the elusive charge self&#8208;trapping site. In this work, a new deep eutectic solvent to engineer bismuth vacancies (Bivac) of BiVO4 photoanode is reported; the novel Bivac can remarkably increase the charge diffusion coefficient by 5.8&#160;times (from 1.82 &#215; 10&#8722;7 to 1.06 &#215; 10&#8722;6 cm2 s&#8722;1), which boosts the charge transport efficiency. Through further loading CoBi cocatalyst to enhance charge transfer efficiency, the photocurrent density of BiVO4 photoanode with optimal Bivac concentration reaches 4.5 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode under AM 1.5 G illumination, which is higher than that of previously reported Ovac engineered BiVO4 photoanode where the BiVO4 photoanode is synthesized by a similar procedure. This work perfects a cation defect engineering that enables the potential capability to equate the charge transport properties in different types of semiconductor materials for solar fuel conversion.

         <title>Interfacial Design for a 4.6&#160;V High&#8208;Voltage Single&#8208;Crystalline LiCoO2 Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;crystalline cathode materials have attracted intensive interest. However, the single&#8208;crystalline LiCoO2 suffers severe structural instability and capacity fading when charged to high voltages (4.6 V vs Li/Li+) due to Co and O element dissolution, crack formation, and electrolyte penetration. In this work, the above problems are inhibited by forming a robust cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) on the surface of LiCoO2.








Abstract
Single&#8208;crystalline cathode materials have attracted intensive interest in offering greater capacity retention than their polycrystalline counterparts by reducing material surfaces and phase boundaries. However, the single&#8208;crystalline LiCoO2 suffers severe structural instability and capacity fading when charged to high voltages (4.6&#160;V) due to Co element dissolution and O loss, crack formation, and subsequent electrolyte penetration. Herein, by forming a robust cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) in an all&#8208;fluorinated electrolyte, reversible planar gliding along the (003) plane in a single&#8208;crystalline LiCoO2 cathode is protected due to the prevention of element dissolution and electrolyte penetration. The robust CEI effectively controls the performance fading issue of the single&#8208;crystalline cathode at a high operating voltage of 4.6&#160;V, providing new insights for improved electrolyte design of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density battery cathode materials.

         <title>Fast Ionic Storage in Aqueous Rechargeable Batteries: From Fundamentals to Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion diffusion coefficients are highly related to the size and dimension of tunnels in materials, the radius of various ions, and the coinserted or lattice H2O molecules. Monovalent and divalent ions show significant differences in reaction kinetics in materials for their unique diffusion characteristics. Therefore, comprehensive review and prospects are provided for fast ionic storage in aqueous batteries.








Abstract
The highly dynamic nature of grid&#8208;scale energy systems necessitates fast kinetics in energy storage and conversion systems. Rechargeable aqueous batteries are a promising energy&#8208;storage solution for renewable&#8208;energy grids as the ionic diffusivity in aqueous electrolytes can be up to 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude higher than in organic systems, in addition to being highly safe and low cost. Recent research in this regard has focussed on developing suitable electrode materials for fast ionic storage in aqueous electrolytes. In this review, breakthroughs in the field of fast ionic storage in aqueous battery materials, and 1D/2D/3D and over&#8208;3D&#8208;tunnel materials are summarized, and tunnels in over&#8208;3D materials are not oriented in any direction in particular. Various materials with different tunnel sizes are developed to be suitable for the different ionic radii of Li+, Na+, K+, H+, NH4+, and Zn2+, which show significant differences in the reaction kinetics of ionic storage. New topochemical paths for ion insertion/extraction, which provide superfast ionic storage, are also discussed.

         <title>Compositionally Graded KNN&#8208;Based Multilayer Composite with Excellent Piezoelectric Temperature Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept of structural gradient is proposed by designing compositionally graded multilayer composite with multiple successive phase transitions. The structural gradient ceramics exhibit a superior piezoelectric temperature stability over extensively studied lead&#8208;free piezoelectrics, and thereby achieve a new record performance.








Abstract
The inherent disadvantage of lead&#8208;free potassium sodium niobate (KNN)&#8208;based ceramics is the severe temperature instability of piezoelectric charge coefficient (d33) caused by the polymorphic phase boundary. Herein, a new concept of structural gradient is proposed by designing compositionally graded multilayer composites with multiple successive phase transitions, to solve the challenge of the inferior temperature stability. The structural gradient ceramics exhibit a superior temperature reliability (d33 remains almost unchanged in the temperature range of 25&#8211;100 &#176;C), far outperforming the previously reported KNN counterparts with d33 variation above 27% over the same temperature range. The synergistic contribution of the continuous phase transition, the strain gradient, and the complementary effect of each constituent layer leads to the excellent temperature stability, which is also confirmed by phase&#8208;field simulation. These findings are expected to provide a new paradigm for functional material design with outstanding temperature stability.

Abstract
The shuttling behaviour and sluggish conversion kinetics of the intermediate lithium polysulfides (LiPS) represent the main obstructions to the practical application of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Herein, we present a one&#8208;dimensional (1D) &#960;&#8208;d conjugated metal&#8208;organic framework, Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;1D, as an efficient sulfur host to overcome these limitations. Experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;1D is characterized by a remarkable binding strength for trapping soluble LiPS species. Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;1D also acts as an effective catalyst for S reduction during the discharge process and Li2S oxidation during the charging process. In addition, the delocalization of electrons in the &#960;&#8208;d system of Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;1D provides a superior electrical conductivity to improve electron transfer. Thus, cathodes based on Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;1D enable LSBs with excellent performance, e.g., impressive cycling stability with over 82% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 3 C, superior rate performance of 575 mAh g&#8722;1 at 8 C, and a high areal capacity of 6.63 mAh cm&#8722;2 under raised sulfur loading of 6.7&#160;mg cm&#8722;2. The strategies and advantages here demonstrated can be extended to a broader range of &#960;&#8208;d conjugated MOFs materials, which we believe have a high potential as sulfur hosts in LSBs.

&lt;p&gt;The shuttling behaviour and sluggish conversion kinetics of the intermediate lithium polysulfides (LiPS) represent the main obstructions to the practical application of lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs).

         <title>Stabilization of Metastable Halide Perovskite Lattices in the 2D Limit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The size effects of metastability in halide perovskites, especially the phase stabilization in the 2D limit due to the dominance of surface effects, are critically reviewed. This stabilization allows the incorporation of various A&#8208;cations that deemed oversized for 3D perovskites into the 2D perovskite lattices, which provide new insights on how the A&#8208;cations influence the structural, optoelectronic, and ferroelectric properties.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites constitute a new class of semiconductors that are structurally tailorable, exhibiting rich structural polymorphs. In this perspective, the polymorphism in lead halide perovskites is described&#8212;a material system currently used for high&#8208;performance photovoltaics and optoelectronics. Strategies for stabilizing the metastable perovskite polymorphs based on crystal size reduction and surface functionalization are critically reviewed. Focus is on an unprecedented stabilization of metastable perovskite lattices in the 2D limit (e.g., with a thickness down to a few unit cells) due to the dominance of surface effects. This stabilization allows the incorporation of various A&#8208;cations that deemed oversized for 3D perovskites into the 2D perovskite lattices, which bring new insights on the relationships between the crystal structures and optoelectronic properties and lead to emergent ferroelectricity in halide perovskites. A comprehensive understanding is provided on how the A&#8208;cations influence the structural, optoelectronic, and ferroelectric properties, with an emphasis on the second order Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion caused by the oversized A&#8208;cations. Finally, future perspectives on new structure exploration and studies of fundamental photophysical properties using stabilized perovskite lattices are provided.

Abstract
Iminosemiquinone linker&#8208;based conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (c&#8208;MOFs) have attracted much attention as next&#8208;generation electronic materials due to their high electrical conductivity combined with high porosity. However, the utility of such c&#8208;MOFs in high&#8208;performance devices has been limited to date by the lack of high&#8208;quality MOFs thin&#8208;film processing. Herein, we introduce a technique known as Microfluidic&#8208;Assisted Solution Shearing combined with Post&#8208;synthetic Rapid Crystallization (MASS&#8208;PRC) process to generate a high&#8208;quality, flexible, and transparent thin&#8208;film of Ni3(hexaiminotriphenylene)2 (Ni3(HITP)2) uniformly over a large&#8208;area in a high&#8208;throughput manner with thickness controllability down to tens of nanometers. The MASS&#8208;PRC process utilizes 1) micromixer&#8208;embedded blade to simultaneously mix and continuously supply metal&#8208;ligand solution towards the drying front during solution shearing to generate an amorphous thin&#8208;film, followed by 2) immersion in amine solution for rapid directional crystal growth. As&#8208;synthesized c&#8208;MOF film had transparency of up to 88.8% and conductivity as high as 37.1 S/cm. High uniformity in conductivity was confirmed over a 3500 mm2 area with an arithmetic mean roughness (Ra) of 4.78&#160;nm. Our flexible thin&#8208;film demonstrated the highest level of transparency for Ni3(HITP)2 and the highest hydrogen sulfide (H2S) sensing performance (2085% at 5&#160;ppm) amongst c&#8208;MOFs&#8208;based H2S sensors, enabling wearable gas sensing applications.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered assembly of solution&#8208;processable materials with regulated patterning, dimensions, and orientation lays foundation for the integration of high&#8208;performance devices. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art assembly methods developed based on superwetting interfaces are overviewed. The confined capillary liquids have been highlighted as a versatile and robust platform for the long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered assembly of organic semiconductors, metal&#8208;halide perovskites, and colloidal nanoparticles.








Abstract
On&#8208;chip integration of solution&#8208;processable materials imposes stringent and simultaneous requirements of controlled nucleation and growth, tunable geometry and dimensions, and long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered assembly, which is challenging in solution process far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Superwetting interfaces, underpinned by programmable surface chemistry and topography, are promising for steering transport, dewetting, and microfluid dynamics of liquids, thus opening a new paradigm for micro&#8208;/nanostructure assembly in solution process. Herein, assembly methods on the basis of superwetting interfaces are reviewed for constructing long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered micro&#8208;/nanostructures. Confined capillary liquids, including capillary bridges and capillary corner menisci realized by controlling local wettability and surface topography, are highlighted for simultaneously attained deterministic patterning and long&#8208;range order. The versatility and robustness of confined capillary liquids are discussed with assembly of single&#8208;crystalline micro&#8208;/nanostructures of organic semiconductors, metal&#8208;halide perovskites, and colloidal&#8208;nanoparticle superlattices, which lead to enhanced device performances and exotic functionalities. Finally, a perspective for promising directions in this realm is provided.

The versatility and robustness of confined capillary liquids are discussed with assembly of single-crystalline micro-/nanostructures of organic semiconductors, metal-halide perovskites, and colloidal-nanoparticle superlattices, which lead to enhanced device performances and exotic functionalities. Finally, a perspective for promising directions in this realm is provided.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
If a truly multifunctional material with a large spin&#8208;orbit coupling is looked for, it would be hard to beat KTaO3 (KTO). The 2D electron gas housed by KTO&#8208;based thin films and heterostructures exhibits spin&#8208;polarization, ferroelectricity, superconductivity, persistent photocurrent, etc., and provides a platform to realize exotic relativistic quantum particles. Read this state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art review for all the fascinating details.








Abstract
Long after the heady days of high&#8208;temperature superconductivity, the oxides came back into the limelight in 2004 with the discovery of the 2D electron gas (2DEG) in SrTiO3 (STO) and several heterostructures based on it. Not only do these materials exhibit interesting physics, but they have also opened up new vistas in oxide electronics and spintronics. However, much of the attention has recently shifted to KTaO3 (KTO), a material with all the &#8220;good&#8221; properties of STO (simple cubic structure, high mobility, etc.) but with the additional advantage of a much larger spin&#8208;orbit coupling. In this state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art review of the fascinating world of KTO, it is attempted to cover the remarkable progress made, particularly in the last five years. Certain unsolved issues are also indicated, while suggesting future research directions as well as potential applications. The range of physical phenomena associated with the 2DEG trapped at the interfaces of KTO&#8208;based heterostructures include spin polarization, superconductivity, quantum oscillations in the magnetoresistance, spin&#8208;polarized electron transport, persistent photocurrent, Rashba effect, topological Hall effect, and inverse Edelstein Effect. It is aimed to discuss, on a single platform, the various fabrication techniques, the exciting physical properties and future application possibilities of this family of materials.

         <title>Spin&#8211;Orbit Torque Switching in an All&#8208;Van der Waals Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure with an atomically sharp interface based on topological semimetal shows spin&#8211;orbit torque (SOT)&#8208;driven magnetization switching. These findings highlight that engineering vdW&#8208;type topological materials and magnets offers a promising route to energy&#8208;efficient magnetization control in SOT&#8208;based spintronics.








Abstract
Current&#8208;induced control of magnetization in ferromagnets using spin&#8211;orbit torque (SOT) has drawn attention as a new mechanism for fast and energy efficient magnetic memory devices. Energy&#8208;efficient spintronic devices require a spin&#8208;current source with a large SOT efficiency (&#958;) and electrical conductivity (&#963;), and an efficient spin injection across a transparent interface. Herein, single crystals of the van der Waals (vdW)&#160;topological semimetal WTe2&#160;and&#160;vdW ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2 are used to satisfy the requirements in their all&#8208;vdW&#8208;heterostructure with an atomically sharp interface. The results exhibit values of &#958;&#160;&#8776; 4.6 and &#963;&#160;&#8776; 2.25 &#215; 105&#160;&#937;&#8208;1 m&#8208;1 for WTe2. Moreover, the significantly reduced switching current density of 3.90 &#215; 106 A cm&#8722;2 at 150 K is obtained, which is an order of magnitude smaller than those of conventional heavy&#8208;metal/ferromagnet thin films. These findings highlight that engineering vdW&#8208;type&#160;topological materials and magnets&#160;offers a promising route to energy&#8208;efficient magnetization control in&#160;SOT&#8208;based spintronics.

         <title>Crystalline&#8208;Amorphous Interfaces Coupling of CoSe2/CoP with Optimized d&#8208;band Center and Boosted Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Amorphous and heterojunctions materials have been widely used in the field of electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution due to their unique physicochemical properties. However, the current used individual strategy still has limited effects. Hence efficient tailoring tactics with synergistic&#8208;effect are highly desired. Herein, we have realized the deep optimization of catalytic activity by constructing crystalline&#8208;amorphous CoSe2/CoP heterojunction. Benefiting from the strong electronic coupling at the interfaces, the d&#8208;band center of the material moves further down compared to its crystalline&#8208;crystalline counterpart, optimizing the valence state and the H adsorption of Co and lowering the kinetic barrier of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The heterojunction shows an overpotential of 65&#160;mV to drive a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 in the acidic medium. Besides, it also shows competitive properties in both neutral and basic media. This work provides inspiration for optimizing the catalytic activity through combining crystalline and amorphous heterojunction, which can be implemented for other transition metal compound electrocatalysts.

         <title>Heterometallic Benzenehexathiolato Coordination Nanosheets: Periodic Structure Improves Crystallinity and Electrical Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Coordination nanosheets are an emerging class of two&#8208;dimensional, bottom&#8208;up materials having fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated, planar, graphite&#8208;like structures with high electrical conductivities. Since their discovery, great effort has been devoted to expand the variety of coordination nanosheets; however, in most cases, their low crystallinity in thick films hampers practical device applications. In this study, mixtures of nickel and copper ions are employed to fabricate benzenehexathiolato (BHT) &#8208;based coordination nanosheet films, and serendipitously, we find that this heterometallicity preferentially forms a structural phase with improved film crystallinity. Spectroscopic and scattering measurements provide evidence for a bilayer structure with in&#8208;plane periodic arrangement of copper and nickel ions with the NiCu2BHT formula. Compared with homometallic films, heterometallic films exhibit more crystalline microstructures with larger and more oriented grains, achieving higher electric conductivities reaching metallic behaviours. Low dependency of Seebeck coefficient on the mixing ratio of nickel and copper ions supports that the large variation in the conductivity data is not caused by change in the intrinsic properties of the films. Our findings open new pathways to improve crystallinity and to tune functional properties of two&#8208;dimensional coordination nanosheets.

         <title>Stabilizing Layered Structure in Aqueous Electrolyte via Dynamic Water Intercalation/Deintercalation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Aqueous lithium&#8208;ion batteries (ALIBs) with nonflammable feature attract great attention for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the layered cathode materials (such as LiCoO2) present serious capacity decay in ALIBs. The degradation mechanism of layered cathode materials in ALIBs is still not clear and effective strategy to improve cycling stability remains a great challenge. In this work, we use LiCoO2 as a typical example to investigate its structural degradation in aqueous electrolytes. It is found that H+ insertion accelerated irreversible layered&#8208;to&#8208;spinel phase transition is the main reason causing structural degradation and fast capacity fading in LiCoO2. Subsequently, Li&#8208;excess Li1+tCo1&#8208;tO2&#8208;t with intermediate spin Co3+ is developed to mitigate H+ influence and the adverse phase transition in aqueous electrolyte. It is interesting to discover that reversible water intercalation/deintercalation occur in the layered structure during charge/discharge, which effectively suppresses the layered&#8208;to&#8208;spinel phase transition with cycling. Benefiting from the stabilized layered structure, the Li&#8208;excess Li1.08Co0.92O1.92 shows significantly improved cycling performance in the neutral aqueous electrolyte with large specific capacity and excellent rate capability. This work provides a promising structural regulation strategy for the layered cathode materials, enabling their potential application in ALIBs.

It is found that H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; insertion accelerated irreversible layered-to-spinel phase transition is the main reason causing structural degradation and fast capacity fading in LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Subsequently, Li-excess Li&lt;sub&gt;1+t&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;1-t&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2-t&lt;/sub&gt; with intermediate spin Co&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is developed to mitigate H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; influence and the adverse phase transition in aqueous electrolyte. It is interesting to discover that reversible water intercalation/deintercalation occur in the layered structure during charge/discharge, which effectively suppresses the layered-to-spinel phase transition with cycling. Benefiting from the stabilized layered structure, the Li-excess Li&lt;sub&gt;1.08&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.92&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;1.92&lt;/sub&gt; shows significantly improved cycling performance in the neutral aqueous electrolyte with large specific capacity and excellent rate capability. This work provides a promising structural regulation strategy for the layered cathode materials, enabling their potential application in ALIBs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Observation of Three&#8208;Dimensional Biexcitons in Pristine&#8208;Quality CH3NH3PbBr3 Single Crystals</title>

Abstract
Halide perovskites (HPs) are fascinating materials whose optoelectronic properties are arguably excitonic. In the HP family, biexcitons are known to exist only in low dimensions where exciton&#8208;exciton binding is strongly enhanced by quantum and dielectric confinements. In this paper, however, we show that they indeed do exist in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) bulk CH3NH3PbBr3 (MAPbBr3) single crystals if the pristine crystal quality is ensured for subtle binding of two excitons. The existence of biexcitons is clearly evidenced below 30 K with a binding energy of &#8764;3.9 &#177; 0.3 meV according to i) exciton&#8208;biexciton population dynamics, ii) giant resonant two&#8208;photon excitation of biexcitons, iii) inverted Boltzmann&#8208;type spectral feature, and iv) zero degree of circular polarization in the biexciton photoluminescence. Because of the polariton effect, the two&#8208;photon resonance occurs at the excited biexciton state from which longitudinal&#8208;transverse splitting is calculated to be 3.7 meV. The discovery of the 3D biexcitons underscores the very quality of HP crystals for generating various many&#8208;body excitonic phases in MAPbBr3 and its analogues towards the improved understanding of their fundamental properties and highly efficient optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Full&#8208;flexible Intelligent Thermal Touch Panel Based on Intrinsically Plastic Ag2S Semiconductor</title>

Abstract
Wearable touch panel, a typical flexible electronic device, can recognize and feedback the information of finger touch and movement. Excellent wearable touch panels are required to accurately and quickly monitor the signals of finger movement as well as the capacity of bearing various deformation. High&#8208;performance thermistor materials are one of the key functional components, but to date, a long&#8208;standing bottleneck is that inorganic semiconductors are typically brittle while the electrical properties of organic semiconductors are quite low. Herein, we report a high&#8208;performance flexible temperature sensor by using plastic Ag2S with ultrahigh temperature coefficient of resistance of &#8208;4.7%/K and resolution of 0.05 K, and rapid response/recovery time of 0.11/0.11 s. Moreover, the temperature sensor shows excellent durability without performance damage or lose during force stimuli tests. In addition, full&#8208;flexible intelligent touch panel composed of 16&#215;10 Ag2S film&#8208;based temperature sensor array, as well as flexible printed circuit board and deep learning algorithm is designed for perceive finger touch signals in real&#8208;time and intelligent feedback Chinese characters and letters on App. These results strongly show that high&#8208;performance flexible inorganic semiconductors can be widely used in flexible electronics.

         <title>A Solution&#8208;processed Inorganic Emitter with High Spectral Selectivity for Efficient Subambient Radiative Cooling in Hot Humid Climates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Daytime radiative cooling provides an eco&#8208;friendly solution to space cooling with zero energy consumption. Despite significant advances, most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art radiative coolers show broadband infrared emission with low spectral selectivity, which limits their cooling temperatures, especially in hot humid regions. Here we report an all&#8208;inorganic narrowband emitter comprising a solution&#8208;derived SiOxNy layer sandwiched between a reflective substrate and a self&#8208;assembly monolayer of SiO2 microspheres. It shows a high and diffusive solar reflectance (96.4%) and strong infrared&#8208;selective emittance (94.6%) with superior spectral selectivity (1.46). Remarkable subambient cooling of up to 5&#176;C in autumn and 2.5&#176;C in summer are achieved under high humidity without any solar shading or convection cover at noontime in a subtropical coastal city, Hong Kong. Owing to the all&#8208;inorganic hydrophobic structure, the emitter shows outstanding resistance to ultraviolet and water in the long&#8208;term durability tests. The scalable solution&#8208;based fabrication renders this stable high&#8208;performance emitter promising for large&#8208;scale deployment in various climates.

         <title>High&#8208;performance ternary perovskite&#8208;organic solar cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Perovskite solar cells in which two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites are incorporated within a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskite network exhibit improved stability with respect to purely 3D systems, but lower record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Here, we report a breakthrough in achieving enhanced PCEs, increased stability, and suppressed photocurrent hysteresis by incorporating n&#8208;type, low optical gap conjugated organic molecules into 2D:3D mixed perovskite composites. The resulting ternary perovskite&#8208;organic composites display extended absorption in the near&#8208;infrared region, improved film morphology, enlarged crystallinity, balanced charge transport, efficient photo&#8208;induced charge transfer, and suppressed counter&#8208;ion movement. As a result, the ternary perovskite&#8208;organic solar cells exhibit PCEs over 23%, which are among the best PCEs for perovskite solar cells with the p&#8208;i&#8208;n device structure. Moreover, the ternary perovskite&#8208;organic solar cells possess dramatically enhanced stability and diminished photocurrent hysteresis. All these results demonstrate that our strategy of exploiting ternary perovskite&#8208;organic composite thin films provides a facile way to realize high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells.

         <title>A Facile &#8220;Double Catalysts&#8221; Approach to Directionally Fabricate Pyridinic N&#8208;B Pair Doped Crystal Graphene Nanoribbons/Amorphous Carbon Hybrid Electrocatalysts for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The carbon material is one promising electrocatalyst in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Heteroatoms doping, the most widely&#8208;used modulating strategy, has attracted many efforts in the past decade. Despite all this, the catalytic activity of heteroatoms modulated carbon is hard to compare to that of metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Here, a &#8220;double catalysts&#8221; (Fe salt, H3BO3) strategy is presented to directionally fabricate porous structure of crystal graphene nanoribbons (GNs)/amorphous carbon doped by pyridinic N&#8208;B pairs. The porous structure and GNs accelerate ion/mass and electron transport, respectively. The N percent in pyridinic N&#8208;B pairs accounts for &#8764;80% of all doped N species. The pyridinic N&#8208;B pair drives ORR via an almost 4e&#8722; transfer pathway with a half&#8208;wave potential (0.812&#160;V versus RHE) and onset potential (0.876&#160;V versus RHE) in the alkaline solution. The ORR catalytic performance of as&#8208;prepared carbon catalysts approximates commercial Pt/C and outperforms most prior carbon&#8208;based catalysts. The assembled Zn&#8208;air battery exhibits a high peak power density of 94&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. The DFT simulation unravels that, the pyridinic N&#8208;B pair possesses the highest catalytic activity among all potential configurations, due to the highest charge density at C active sites neighboring B, which enhances interaction strength with intermediates in the p&#8208;band center.

         <title>Bioinspired 2D Isotropically Fatigue&#8208;Resistant Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D fatigue&#8208;resistant hydrogels are fabricated through synergistically engineering the 2D lamellar microstructures and nanocrystalline domains, involving the formation of preferentially aligned lamellar micro/nanostructures through the bidirectional freeze&#8208;casting process, followed by compression annealing. Their application as load&#8208;bearing components in a jellyfish&#8208;inspired underwater robot is investigated.








Abstract
Engineering conventional hydrogels with muscle&#8208;like anisotropic structures can efficiently increase the fatigue threshold over 1000 J m&#8722;2 along the alignment direction; however, the fatigue threshold perpendicular to the alignment is still as low as &#8776;100&#8211;300 J m&#8722;2, making them nonsuitable for those scenarios where isotropic properties are desired. Here, inspired by the distinct structure&#8211;properties relationship of heart valves, a simple yet general strategy to engineer conventional hydrogels with unprecedented yet isotropic fatigue resistance, with a record&#8208;high fatigue threshold over 1,500 J m&#8722;2 along two arbitrary in&#8208;plane directions is reported. The two&#8208;step process involves the formation of preferentially aligned lamellar micro/nanostructures through a bidirectional freeze&#8208;casting process, followed by compression annealing, synergistically contributing to extraordinary resistance to fatigue crack propagation. The study provides a viable means of fabricating soft materials with isotropically extreme properties, thereby unlocking paths to apply these advanced soft materials toward applications including soft robotics, flexible electronics, e&#8208;skins, and tissue&#160;patches.

         <title>A Multilevel Analytical Theory for Prediction of Ferroelectric Perovskite Oxide Properties from Composition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multilevel model for the prediction of the technologically important properties of perovskite oxide ferroelectric solid solutions is developed, starting at the level of the electronic structure and chemical bonding of the constituent ions and ending at the level of collective macroscopic behavior. This approach is likely to be generally applicable to different classes of materials and functional properties.








Abstract
Prediction of properties from composition is a fundamental goal of materials science that is particularly relevant for ferroelectric perovskite oxide solid solutions where compositional variation is a primary tool for material design. Design of ferroelectric oxide solid solutions has been guided by heuristics and first&#8208;principles and Landau&#8211;Ginzburg&#8211;Devonshire theoretical methods that become increasingly difficult to apply in ternary, quaternary, and quintary solid solutions. To address this problem, a multilevel model is developed for the prediction of the ferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;paraelectric transition temperature (Tc), coercive field (Ec), and polarization (P) of PbTiO3&#8208;derived ferroelectric solid solutions from composition. The characteristics of the materials at different length scales, starting at the level of the electronic structure and chemical bonding of the constituent ions and ending at the level of collective behavior, are analytically related by using ferroelectric domain walls and cationic off&#8208;center displacements as the key links between the different levels of the model. The obtained composition&#8211;structure&#8211;property relationships provide a unified quantitatively predictive theory for understanding PbTiO3&#8208;derived solid solutions. Such a multilevel analytical modeling approach is likely to be generally applicable to different classes of ferroelectric perovskite oxides and to other functional properties, and to materials and properties beyond the field of ferroelectrics.

         <title>Dynamic Metal&#8211;Ligand Interaction of Synergistic Polymers for Bistable See&#8208;Through Electrochromic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible see&#8208;through bistable electrochromic display based on polymer&#8208;assisted dynamic metal&#8211;ligand coordination is achieved successfully. It benefits from the stabilization of dye molecules by metal ions, the fixing effect, and the inhibited diffusion for metal ions by the closely associated ligand polymers. The synergistic polymers possess good film&#8208;forming ability, easy fabrication, and high transmittance with excellent bistability. These contribute potential for energy&#8208;saving displays.








Abstract
Bistable electrochromic materials are a promising alternative solution to reduce energy consumption in displays. Limited by the mechanism and lack of a design strategy, only a few electrochromic materials have truly been able achieve bistability. Herein, a novel strategy is proposed to design bistable electrochromic materials based on polymer&#8208;assisted dynamic metal&#8211;ligand coordination. The mechanism and materials of such unconventional electrochromic systems are proved by sufficient characterization. Synergistic stabilization of polymerized switchable dyes and the ionic ligand polymer are attracted to each other by supramolecular forces. The color states of the dye molecules are controlled and stabilized by valence changes of the metal ions. Meanwhile, through the polymerization of the electrochromic material and the nearby metal&#8211;ligand material, the metal ions of the electroinduced valence change are tightly fixed, and the related diffusion problem of the active EC component is also almost completely suppressed. This strategy successfully enables preparation of the corresponding transparent electrochromic displays with good performances, such as, the display information is clearly visible for more than 1.5 h without consuming energy.&#160;Furthermore, the new way of dynamic coordination or dissociation bistable displays could likely prosper the development of the electrochromic area and inspire other fields.

         <title>Tailoring Hyperbranched Poly(&#946;&#8208;amino ester) as a Robust and Universal Platform for Cytosolic Protein Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;degradable, hyperbranched poly(&#946;&#8208;amino ester) (HPAE) with well&#8208;tailored structure enables highly efficient cytosolic protein/peptide delivery into cancer cells, and it quickly degrades in response to over&#8208;produced H2O2 to facilitate the intracellular cargo release and potentiate the protein activity.








Abstract
Cytosolic protein delivery is a prerequisite for protein&#8208;based biotechnologies and therapeutics on intracellular targets. Polymers that can complex with proteins to form nano&#8208;assemblies represent one of the most important categories of materials, because of the ease of nano&#8208;fabrication, high protein loading efficiency, no need for purification, and maintenance of protein bioactivity. Stable protein encapsulation and efficient intracellular liberation are two critical yet opposite processes toward cytosolic delivery, and polymers that can resolve these two conflicting challenges are still lacking. Herein, hyperbranched poly(&#946;&#8208;amino ester) (HPAE) with backbone&#8208;embedded phenylboronic acid (PBA) is developed to synchronize these two processes, wherein PBA enhanced protein encapsulation via nitrogen&#8211;boronate (N&#8211;B) coordination while triggered polymer degradation and protein release upon oxidation by H2O2 in cancer cells. Upon optimization of the branching degree, charge density, and PBA distribution, the best&#8208;performing A2&#8208;B3&#8208;C2&#8208;S2&#8208;P2 is identified, which mediates robust delivery of various native proteins/peptides with distinct molecular weights (1.6&#8211;430&#160;kDa) and isoelectric points (4.1&#8211;10.3) into cancer cells, including enzymes, toxins, antibodies, and CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). Moreover, A2&#8208;B3&#8208;C2&#8208;S2&#8208;P2 mediates effective cytosolic delivery of saporin both in vitro and in vivo to provoke remarkable anti&#8208;tumor efficacy. Such a potent and universal platform holds transformative potentials for protein pharmaceuticals.

         <title>High&#8208;Energy Aqueous Ammonium&#8208;Ion Hybrid Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous ammonium&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitors (A&#8208;HSCs) based on a layered &#948;&#8208;MnO2 cathode, an activated carbon cloth anode, and an aqueous (NH4)2SO4 electrolyte are successfully developed. The A&#8208;HSCs deliver an ultrahigh capacitance, amenable area energy density, and decent durability. This study proposes a new paradigm for electrochemical energy storage.








Abstract
The development of novel electrochemical energy storage devices is a grand challenge. Here, an aqueous ammonium&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitor (A&#8208;HSC), consisting of a layered &#948;&#8208;MnO2 based cathode, an activated carbon cloth anode, and an aqueous (NH4)2SO4 electrolyte is developed.

         <title>Smart Adhesives via Magnetic Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart adhesive that exploits bioinspired adhesives and hard&#8208;magnetic soft materials is introduced to achieve dynamically tunable adhesion. The smart adhesive with a magnetic tip is actuated by a magnetic field to create an initial crack at the adhesion interface, so as to modulate the adhesion from strong to weak.








Abstract
Smart adhesives possess a wide range of applications owing to their reversibly and repeatedly switchable adhesion in transfer technology. Despite recent advances, it still remains a technical and scientific challenge to achieve strategies for rapidly tunable adhesion in a noncontact manner. In this study, a smart adhesive to achieve dynamically tunable adhesion is developed. Specifically, a mushroom&#8208;shaped adhesive with a magnetized tip is actuated to reversibly and rapidly transform the morphology via magnetic actuation. The smart adhesive has two working modes, namely, selective pickup mode and pick&#8208;and&#8208;place mode. In the selective pickup mode, the external magnetic field is applied and the tip undergoes bending deformation. Changes in tip morphology allow for a reversible switch of the adhesion between &#8220;turn on&#8221; and &#8220;turn off.&#8221; In the pick&#8208;and&#8208;place mode, the external magnetic field is applied when the target object needs to be released. Upward bending deformation of the micro&#8208;beam, a part of the tip, creates an initial crack at the edge of the adhesion interface. The propagation of the edge crack modulates the adhesion from strong to weak and the target object is instantly released. The proposed smart adhesive may be of interest for practical applications demanding highly precise and swiftly controlled movements.

         <title>Surface Passivation Using 2D Perovskites toward Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments in 2D/3D heterostructure perovskite solar cells (PSCs) using surface passivation. The basic crystal structure, surface passivation strategy/process, optoelectronic properties, enhanced stability, and outstanding performance based on 2D/3D PSCs are systematically discussed. In addition, some emerging challenges and critical thoughts for 2D/3D PSCs are proposed to provide insights into follow&#8208;up studies.








Abstract
3D perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have shown great promise for use in next&#8208;generation photovoltaic devices. However, some challenges need to be addressed before their commercial production, such as enormous defects formed on the surface, which result in severe SRH recombination, and inadequate material interplay between the composition, leading to thermal&#8208;, moisture&#8208;, and light&#8208;induced degradation. 2D perovskites, in which the organic layer functions as a protective barrier to block the erosion of moisture or ions, have recently emerged and attracted increasing attention because they exhibit significant robustness. Inspired by this, surface passivation by employing 2D perovskites deposited on the top of 3D counterparts has triggered a new wave of research to simultaneously achieve higher efficiency and stability. Herein, we&#160;exploited a vast amount of literature to comprehensively summarize the recent progress on 2D/3D heterostructure PSCs using surface passivation. The review begins with an introduction of the crystal structure, followed by the advantages of the combination of 2D and 3D perovskites. Then, the surface passivation strategies, optoelectronic properties, enhanced stability, and photovoltaic performance of 2D/3D PSCs are systematically discussed. Finally, the perspectives of passivation techniques using 2D perovskites to offer insight into further improved photovoltaic performance in the future are proposed.

         <title>Zwitterionic Polymer Electroplating Facilitates the Preparation of Electrode Surfaces for Biosensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zwitterionic polypyrrole (ZiPPy) is applied to produce an optimal surface for biosensing electrodes. ZiPPy efficiently hydrates the electrode surface to minimize nonspecific protein adsorption, while enabling rapid, controlled polymer deposition through electropolymerization. ZiPPy&#8208;coated electrodes are used to detect neutralizing antibodies against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in human saliva.








Abstract
Surface chemistry critically affects the diagnostic performance of biosensors. An ideal sensor surface should be resistant to nonspecific protein adsorption, yet be conducive to analytical responses. Here a new polymeric material, zwitterionic polypyrrole (ZiPPy), is reported to produce optimal surface condition for biosensing electrodes. ZiPPy combines two unique advantages: the zwitterionic function that efficiently hydrates electrode surface, hindering nonspecific binding of hydrophobic proteins; and the pyrrole backbone, which enables rapid (&lt;7&#160;min), controlled deposition of ZiPPy through electropolymerization. ZiPPy&#8208;coated electrodes show lower electrochemical impedance and less nonspecific protein adsorption (low fouling), outperforming bare and polypyrrole&#8208;coated electrodes. Moreover, affinity ligands for target biomarkers can be immobilized together with ZiPPy in a single&#8208;step electropolymerization. ZiPPy&#8208;coated electrodes are developed with specificity for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2). The prepared sensor detects SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 antibodies in human saliva down to 50&#160;ng mL&#8722;1, without the need for sample purification or secondary labeling.

         <title>Nanolayer Laser Absorber for Femtoliter Chemistry in Polymer Reactors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Distinct challenges in femtoliter chemistry are precise chemical transfer and reaction in ultrasmall volumes. Here, a novel nanoabsorber film, revolutionizing the standard laser&#8208;induced forward transfer of polymers with significantly improved resolution, time&#8208;, and cost&#8208;efficiency is introduced. Moreover, this technology enables in situ photochemical oxidation within milliseconds, offering a potentially rapid approach for high&#8208;throughput screening of photochemical reaction conditions and substrate scope.








Abstract
Laser&#8208;induced forward transfer (LIFT) has the potential to be an alternative approach to atomic force microscopy based scanning probe lithography techniques, which have limitations in high&#8208;speed and large&#8208;scale patterning. However, traditional donor slides limit the resolution and chemical flexibility of LIFT. Here, a hematite nanolayer absorber for donor slides to achieve high&#8208;resolution transfers down to sub&#8208;femtoliters is proposed. Being wettable by both aqueous and organic solvents, this new donor significantly increases the chemical scope for the LIFT process. For parallel amino acid coupling reactions, the patterning resolution can now be increased more than five times (&gt;111&#160;000 spots&#160;cm&#8722;2 for hematite donor vs 20&#160;000 spots&#160;cm&#8722;2 for standard polyimide donor) with even faster scanning (2&#160;vs 6&#160;ms per spot). Due to the increased chemical flexibility, other types of reactions inside ultrasmall polymer reactors: copper (I) catalyzed click chemistry and laser&#8208;driven oxidation of a tetrahydroisoquinoline derivative, suggesting the potential of LIFT for both deposition of chemicals, and laser&#8208;driven photochemical synthesis in femtoliters within milliseconds can be explored. Since the hematite shows no damage after typical laser transfer, donors can be regenerated by heat treatment. These findings will transform the LIFT process into an automatable, precise, and highly efficient technology for high&#8208;throughput femtoliter chemistry.

         <title>Biohybrid Variable&#8208;Stiffness Soft Actuators that Self&#8208;Create Bone</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinduced variable&#8208;stiffness actuators are prepared by combining polypyrrole and alginate gel functionalized with cell&#8208;derived plasma membrane nanofragments. The actuators can morph in various shapes and change their properties from soft to rigid by growing their own bone, due to mineralization, within 2 days. Different patterning for programmed directional movements, and morphing and adhesion to bone tissue are also demonstrated.








Abstract
Inspired by the dynamic process of initial bone development, in which a soft tissue turns into a solid load&#8208;bearing structure, the fabrication, optimization, and characterization of bioinduced variable&#8208;stiffness actuators that can morph in various shapes and change their properties from soft to rigid are hereby presented. Bilayer devices are prepared by combining the electromechanically active properties of polypyrrole with the compliant behavior of alginate gels that are uniquely functionalized with cell&#8208;derived plasma membrane nanofragments (PMNFs), previously shown to mineralize within 2 days, which promotes the mineralization in the gel layer to achieve the soft to stiff change by growing their own bone. The mineralized actuator shows an evident frozen state compared to the movement before mineralization. Next, patterned devices show programmed directional and fixated morphing. These variable&#8208;stiffness devices can wrap around and, after the PMNF&#8208;induced mineralization in and on the gel layer, adhere and integrate onto bone tissue. The developed biohybrid variable&#8208;stiffness actuators can be used in soft (micro&#8208;)robotics and as potential tools for bone repair or bone tissue engineering.

         <title>Ethylamine Iodide Additive Enables Solid&#8208;to&#8208;Solid Transformed Highly Oriented Perovskite for Excellent Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ethylamine iodide (EAI) is employed to modify pure FAPbI3 film, and a novel solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition theory is raised to depict the effect of EAI on the perovskite crystallization. The photodetector based on the modified film shows high performance.








Abstract
Perovskite has been widely applied in the optoelectronic field due to its strong light absorption and high carrier mobility. Maintaining high crystallization is critical to fabricate high&#8208;performance perovskite devices, where many methods have been reported, such as the use of additives in precursor solutions. However, there are few reports for the working mechanism of these additives. Herein, a new method to obtain highly crystalline formamidinium&#8208;lead triiodide (FAPbI3) perovskite films by introducing ethylamine iodide (EAI) into perovskite precursors is reported and a novel working mechanism for such alkyl amine additives in the crystallization process of perovskites is proposed. Unlike traditional liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid (L&#8211;S) crystallization theory, the research results indicate that EAI affects the solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid (S&#8211;S) transition process from the intermediate yellow phase to the final black phase, and this mechanism is further verified to be universal using other common alkyl amines. A self&#8208;powered photodetector based on an as&#8208;fabricated FAPbI3 film is fabricated with an external quantum efficiency of over 90%. This work provides a deeper understanding of the perovskite crystallization process.

         <title>Bistability, Remanence, Read/write&#8208;memory and Logic Gate Function via A Stimuli Responsive Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Stimuli responsive materials change their state in response to external triggers. Switching between different states enables to write, store and read information, if the transition between the states exhibits hysteresis. Thermally responsive polymers exhibit an intrinsic hysteresis for the volume phase transition between the swollen and de&#8208;swollen solution state. We show that this hysteresis can be used to realize bistability, remanence and reversible write/read information storage. This is demonstrated for the simplest and most widely used thermoresponsive polymer, PNIPAM, as well as for PNIPAM block copolymers, which widen the hysteresis window. We show that the hysteresis is related to cluster domain assembly/disassembly during the phase transition. Information can be written thermally using a laser, or using heated or cooled pen tips on a thin film backscattering display. The bistable state can additionally be switched by pH enabling an AND&#8208;logic gate function. Furthermore, we discovered an unusual memory state, where information is visible in the hysteresis window, and invisible at higher temperatures, allowing to hide encoded information. Since hysteresis is a very common intrinsic phenomenon for responsive materials, this principle to encode and store information is potentially applicable to a broad range of responsive materials.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Field Simulations of Tunable Polar Topologies in Lead&#8208;Free Ferroelectric/Paraelectric Multilayers with Ultrahigh Energy Storage Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Dielectric capacitors are emerging energy storage components that require both high energy storage density and high efficiency. The conventional approach to energy storage enhancement is polar nanodomain engineering via chemical modification. Here we propose a new approach of domain engineering by exploiting tunable polar topologies that have been observed recently in ferroelectric/paraelectric multilayer films. Using phase&#8208;field simulations, we demonstrate that vortex, spiral, and in&#8208;plane polar structures can be stabilized in BiFeO3/SrTiO3 (BFO/STO) multilayers by tailoring the strain state and layer thickness. Various switching dynamics are realized in these polar topologies, resulting in relaxor&#8208;ferroelectric&#8208;, antiferroelectric&#8208; and paraelectric&#8208;like polarization behaviors, respectively. Ultrahigh energy storage densities above 170 J cm&#8722;3 and efficiencies above 95% are achievable in STO/BFO/STO trilayers. This strategy should be generally implementable in other multilayer dielectrics and offers a new avenue to enhancing energy storage by tuning the polar topologies and thus the polarization characteristics.

Abstract
Liquid crystals have been intensively studied as functional materials. Recently, integration of various disciplines has led to new directions in the design of functional liquid&#8208;crystalline materials in the fields of energy, water, photonics, actuation, sensing, and biotechnology. Here, recent advances in functional liquid crystals based on polymers, supramolecular complexes, gels, colloids, and inorganic&#8208;based hybrids are reviewed, from design strategies to functionalization of these materials and interfaces. New insights into liquid crystals provided by significant progress in advanced measurements and computational simulations, which enhance new design and functionalization of liquid&#8208;crystalline materials, are also discussed.

         <title>Star&#8208;Polymer&#8208;DNA Gels Showing Highly Predictable and Tunable Mechanical Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Dynamically crosslinked gels are appealing materials for applications that require time&#8208;dependent mechanical responses. DNA duplexes are ideal crosslinkers for building such gels because of their excellent sequence addressability and flexible tunability in bond energy. However, the mechanical responses of most DNA gels are complicated and unpredictable despite the high potential of DNA. Here, we demonstrate a DNA gel with a highly homogeneous gel network and well&#8208;predictable mechanical behaviors by using a pair of star&#8208;polymer&#8208;DNA precursors with presimulated DNA sequences showing the two&#8208;state transition. The melting curve analysis of the DNA gels reveals the good correspondence between the thermodynamic potentials of the DNA crosslinkers and the presimulated values by DNA calculators. Stress&#8208;relaxation tests and dissociation kinetics measurements show that the macroscopic relaxation time of the DNA gels is approximately equal to the lifetime of the DNA crosslinkers over four orders of magnitude from 0.1&#8208;2,000&#160;sec. Furthermore, a series of durability tests find the DNA gels are hysteresis&#8208;less and self&#8208;healable after the applications of repeated temperature and mechanical stimuli. These results demonstrate the great potential of star&#8208;polymer&#8208;DNA precursors for building gels with predictable and tunable viscoelastic properties, suitable for applications such as stress&#8208;response extracellular matrices, injectable solids, and soft robotics.

         <title>Revisiting the Roles of Natural Graphite in Ongoing Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Graphite commonly including artificial graphite and natural graphite (NG) possesses a relatively high theoretical capacity of 372&#160;mA h g&#8211;1 and appropriate lithiation/de&#8208;lithiation potential, which has been extensively used as the anode of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). With the requirements of reducing CO2 emission to achieve carbon neutral, the market share of NG anode will continue to grow due to its excellent processability and low production energy consumption. NG is divided into flake graphite (FG) and microcrystalline graphite (MG), which is resourceful in China. In the past 30 years, many research teams have foucused on developing modified NG and its derivate materials, which promotes their wide applications in LIBs with superior electrochemical performance. This review gives a comprehensive overview of the origin, roles and research progress of NG&#8208;based materials in ongoing LIBs, including their structure, properties, electrochemical performance, modification methods, derivates, composites and applications, especially the strategies to improve their high&#8208;rate and low&#8208;temperature charging performance. The development orientation as well as future applications of NG&#8208;based materials is also prospected, which will provide significant guidance for the current and future research of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LIBs.

         <title>Doping Control of Magnetic Anisotropy for Stable Antiskyrmion Formation in Schreibersite (Fe,Ni)3P with S4 symmetry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Magnetic skyrmions, vortex&#8208;like topological spin textures, have attracted much interest in a wide range of research fields from fundamental physics to spintronics applications. Recently, growing attention has also been paid to antiskyrmions emerging in opposite topological charge in non&#8208;centrosymmetric magnets with D2d or S4 symmetry. In these magnets, complex interplay among anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii&#8208;Moriya interaction, uniaxial magnetic anisotropy, and magnetic dipolar interactions generates a variety of magnetic structures. However, the relation between the stability of antiskyrmions and these magnetic interactions remains to be elucidated. In this work, we control the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy of schreibersite (Fe,Ni)3P with S4 symmetry by doping and investigate its impact on the stability of antiskyrmions. Our magnetometry study, supported by ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy, shows that the variation of the Ni content and slight doping with 4d transition metals considerably change the magnetic anisotropy. In particular, doping with Pd induces easy&#8208;axis anisotropy, giving rise to formation of antiskyrmions, while a temperature&#8208;induced spin reorientation is observed in a Rh&#8208;doped compound. In combination with Lorentz transmission electron microscopy and micromagnetic simulations, we quantitatively analyze the stability of antiskyrmion as functions of uniaxial anisotropy and demagnetization energy, and demonstrate that subtle balance between them is necessary to stabilize the antiskyrmions.

         <title>Continuous Carbon Channels Enable Full Na&#8208;Ion Accessibility for Superior Room&#8208;Temperature Na&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique continuous carbon pores serve as multifunctional channels to encapsulate highly active S and provide full Na&#8208;ion accessibility. The formation of a solid sodium sulfide interphase in the channels plays critical roles in enabling fast and stable cycling performance of Na&#8211;S batteries.








Abstract
Porous carbon has been widely used as an efficient host to encapsulate highly active molecular sulfur (S) in Li&#8211;S and Na&#8211;S batteries. However, for these sub&#8208;nanosized pores, it is a challenge to provide fully accessible sodium ions with unobstructed channels during cycling, particularly for high sulfur content. It is well recognized that solid interphase with full coverage over the designed architectures plays critical roles in promoting rapid charge transfer and stable conversion reactions in batteries, whereas constructing a high&#8208;ionic&#8208;conductivity solid interphase in the pores is very difficult. Herein, unique continuous carbonaceous pores are tailored, which can serve as multifunctional channels to encapsulate highly active S and provide fully accessible pathways for sodium ions. Solid sodium sulfide interphase layers are also realized in the channels, showing high Na&#8208;ion conductivity toward stabilizing the redox kinetics of the S cathode during charge/discharge processes. This systematically designed carbon&#8208;hosted sulfur cathode delivers superior cycling performance (420 mAh g&#8722;1 at 2 A g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles), high capacity retention of &#8776;90% over 500 cycles at current density of 0.5 A g&#8722;1, and outstanding rate capability (470 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1) for room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Endogenous Electric&#8208;Field&#8208;Coupled Electrospun Short Fiber via Collecting Wound Exudation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D bionic short&#8208;fiber scaffold with excellent reversible hydroscopicity and biostable conductivity is fabricated to achieve precise tissue remodeling by collecting a large amount of secretions in the early stages of wound healing and transmitting bioelectrical signals to proactively match the cascade reaction of tissue repair.








Abstract
Endogenous electric fields (EF) are the basis of bioelectric signal conduction and the priority signal for damaged tissue regeneration. Tissue exudation directly affects the characteristics of endogenous EF. However, current biomaterials lead to passive repair of defect tissue due to limited management of early wound exudates and inability to actively respond to coupled endogenous EF. Herein, the 3D bionic short&#8208;fiber scaffold with the functions of early biofluid collection, response to coupled endogenous EF, is constructed by guiding the short fibers into a 3D network structure and subsequent multifunctional modification. The scaffold exhibits rapid reversible water absorption, reaching maximum after only 30 s. The stable and uniform distribution of polydopamine&#8208;reduced graphene oxide endows the scaffold with stable electrical and mechanical performances even after long&#8208;term immersion. Due to its unique &#8208; bionic structure and tissue affinity, the scaffold further acts as an &#8220;electronic skin,&#8221; which transmits endogenous bioelectricity via absorbing wound exudates, promoting the treatment of diabetic wounds. Furthermore, under the endogenous EF, the cascade release of vascular endothelial growth factor accelerates the healing process. Thus, the versatile scaffold is expected to be an ideal candidate for repairing different defect tissues, especially electrosensitive tissues.

The insufficient delivery of drug limits the therapeutic effect of multiple myeloma. A myeloma cell&#8208;mimicking nanocarrier, which can enter bone marrow based on bone marrow homing and target tumor cells through homologous targeting, is developed. Thus, the amount of drug available at the myeloma site in the bone marrow is increased and an enhanced therapeutic effect is achieved.








Abstract
Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematological malignancy. It is characterized by abnormal transformation and uncontrolled clonal proliferation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM), which can destroy bone structure and inhibit hematopoiesis. Although there are new therapeutic methods, they are not curative, mainly because it is difficult to deliver an effective amount of drug to BM, leading to a failure to eradicate MM cells inside the BM. BM homing is an important and unique characteristic of MM cells and it is mainly affected by surface molecules on the tumor cell membrane. Inspired by this mechanism, an MM&#8208;mimicking nanocarrier is developed by coating bortezomib (BTZ)&#8208;loaded poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone)&#8211;poly(ethylene glycol)&#8211;poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (PCEC) nanoparticles with the MM cell membrane. The MM&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles can enter the BM based on BM homing as a &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; and target the tumor cells through homologous targeting. In this way, drug availability at the myeloma site is enhanced so as to inhibit MM growth. In addition, these MM&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles can escape phagocytosis by the MPS and have a long circulation effect. The in vivo therapeutic results demonstrate an excellent treatment efficacy for MM. Accordingly, this strategy may be a promising platform for the treatment of MM.

         <title>Unraveling Anionic Redox for Sodium Layered Oxide Cathodes: Breakthroughs and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anionic redox reaction in sodium layered transition oxides is considered as a promising tactics to increase the energy density of rechargeable batteries. Herein, a comprehensive review of anionic redox reaction is summarized in terms of evolution history, fundamental mechanism, major challenges, available strategies, classification of sodium layered oxide cathodes, progressive characterization techniques, and prospective trend.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) as the next generation of sustainable energy technologies have received widespread investigations for large&#8208;scale energy storage systems (EESs) and smart grids due to the huge natural abundance and low cost of sodium. Although the great efforts are made in exploring layered transition metal oxide cathode for SIBs, their performances have reached the bottleneck for further practical application. Nowadays, anionic redox in layered transition metal oxides has emerged as a new paradigm to increase the energy density of rechargeable batteries. Based on this point, in this review, the development history of anionic redox reaction is attempted to systematically summarize and provide an in&#8208;depth discussion on the anionic redox mechanism. Particularly, the major challenges of anionic redox and the corresponding available strategies toward triggering and stabilizing anionic redox are proposed. Subsequently, several types of sodium layered oxide cathodes are classified and comparatively discussed according to Na&#8208;rich or Na&#8208;deficient materials. A large amount of progressive characterization techniques of anionic oxygen redox is also summarized. Finally, an overview of the existing prospective and the future development directions of sodium layered transition oxide with anionic redox reaction are analyzed and suggested.

         <title>Anisotropic Foams via Frontal Polymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast and convenient method to obtain anisotropic structural foams using frontal polymerization is described. A full factorial combination of variables is used to correlate the input parameters with the structure of the obtained foams. This work shows promise for creating foams with aligned cellular structures that allow anisotropic mass and energy transport properties in high&#8208;performance structural solids.








Abstract
The properties of foams, an important class of cellular solids, are most sensitive to the volume fraction and openness of its elementary compartments; size, shape, orientation, and the interconnectedness of the cells are other important design attributes. Control of these morphological traits would allow the tailored fabrication of useful materials. While approaches like ice templating have produced foams with elongated cells, there is a need for rapid, versatile, and energy&#8208;efficient methods that also control the local order and macroscopic alignment of cellular elements. Here, a fast and convenient method is described to obtain anisotropic structural foams using frontal polymerization. Foams are fabricated by curing mixtures of dicyclopentadiene and a blowing agent via frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP). The materials are characterized using microcomputed tomography (micro&#8208;CT) and an image analysis protocol to quantify the morphological characteristics. The cellular structure, porosity, and hardness of the foams change with blowing agent, concentration, and resin viscosity. Moreover, a full factorial combination of variables is used to correlate each parameter with the structure of the obtained foams. The results demonstrate the controlled production of foams with specific morphologies using the simple and efficient method of frontal polymerization.

         <title>Vibrational Strong Coupling between Surface Phonon Polaritons and Organic Molecules via Single Quartz Micropillars</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vibrational strong coupling between surface phonon polaritons and molecular vibrations is demonstrated by using single quartz micropillars as optical resonators at mid&#8208;infrared frequencies. The vibrational strong coupling at single optical resonator level shows pronounced mode splitting, anticrossing dispersion, and molecular number dependent coupling strength, which prominently elevates the sensitivity of vibrational strong coupling.








Abstract
Vibrational strong coupling (VSC), the strong coupling between optical resonances and the dipolar absorption of molecular vibrations at mid&#8208;infrared frequencies, holds the great potential for the development of ultrasensitive infrared spectroscopy, the modification of chemical properties of molecules, and the control of chemical reactions. In the realm of ultracompact VSC, there is a need to scale down the size of mid&#8208;infrared optical resonators and to elevate their optical field strength. Herein, by using single quartz micropillars as mid&#8208;infrared optical resonators, the strong coupling is demonstrated between surface phonon polariton (SPhP) resonances and molecular vibrations from far&#8208;field observation. The single quartz micropillars support sharp SPhP resonances with an ultrasmall mode volume, which strongly couples with the molecular vibrations of 4&#8208;nitrobenzyl alcohol (C7H7NO3) molecules featuring pronounced mode splitting and anticrossing dispersion. The coupling strength depends on the molecular concentration and reaches the strong coupling regime with only 7300 molecules. The findings pave the way for promoting the VSC sensitivity, miniaturing the VSC devices, and will boost the development of ultracompact mid&#8208;infrared spectroscopy and chemical reaction control devices.

         <title>Controlling the Emission Zone by Additives for Improved Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The position of the in situ formed emission zone (EZ) in light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells has a profound influence on the device performance because of microcavity effects and doping and electrode quenching. This study shows that the inclusion of easily tuned additives can rationally shift the EZ position for improved performance.








Abstract
The position of the emission zone (EZ) in the active material of a light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cell (LEC) has a profound influence on its performance because of microcavity effects and doping&#8208; and electrode&#8208;induced quenching. Previous attempts of EZ control have focused on the two principal constituents in the active material&#8212;the organic semiconductor (OSC) and the mobile ions&#8212;but this study demonstrates that it is possible to effectively control the EZ position through the inclusion of an appropriate additive into the active material. More specifically, it is shown that a mere modification of the end group on an added neutral compound, which also functions as an ion transporter, results in a shifted EZ from close to the anode to the center of the active material, which translates into a 60% improvement of the power efficiency. This particular finding is rationalized by a lowering of the effective electron mobility of the OSC through specific additive: OSC interactions, but the more important generic conclusion is that it is possible to control the EZ position, and thereby the LEC performance, by the straightforward inclusion of an easily tuned additive in the active material.

A novel graphene&#8208;based opto&#8208;thermoelectric tweezers configuration is demonstrated. Due to the outstanding photo&#8208;thermal properties of the graphene substrate, it brings new advantages of a much broader working bandwidth and a larger working area, and the working power is sharply reduced. Furthermore, parallel trap multiple particles as desired shapes can be easily generated with structured graphene patterns.








Abstract
Since the discovery of graphene, its excellent physical properties have greatly improved the performance of optoelectronic devices and brought important technological advances to optical research and its applications. Here, graphene is introduced to the field of optical&#8208;tweezer technology and demonstrate a new graphene&#8208;based opto&#8208;thermoelectric tweezer. This technology not only reduces the incident light energy required by two orders of magnitude (compared with traditional optical tweezers), it also brings new advantages such as a much broader working bandwidth and a larger working area compared to those of widely researched gold&#8208;film&#8208;based opto&#8208;thermoelectric tweezers. Compared with gold film, graphene exhibits higher thermal conductivity and higher uniformity and is easier to process. Thus, it is found that even monolayer graphene provides stable trapping for particles in a broad bandwidth and that performance is enhanced as the number of graphene layers increases. Furthermore, parallel trap multiple particles as desired shapes can be easily generated with structured graphene patterns. This work demonstrates the enormous application potential of graphene in optical&#8208;tweezer technology and will promote their application to the trapping or concentration of cells and biomolecules as well as to microfluidics and biosensors.

Abstract
Since the pioneering discovery of a protein bound to poly(ethylene glycol), the utility of protein&#8208;polymer conjugates (PPCs) is rapidly expanding to currently emerging applications. Photoinduced energy/electron transfer reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) polymerization is a very promising method to prepare structurally well&#8208;defined PPCs, as it eliminates high&#8208;cost and time&#8208;consuming deoxygenation processes due to its oxygen tolerance. However, oxygen tolerance behavior of PET&#8208;RAFT has not been well investigated in aqueous environments and thereby the preparation of PPCs using PET&#8208;RAFT needs a substantial amount of sacrificial reducing agents or inert&#8208;gas purging processes. We herein report a novel water&#8208;soluble and biocompatible organic photocatalyst (PC) which enables visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven additive&#8208;free &#8220;grafting&#8208;from&#8221; polymerizations of a protein in ambient and aqueous environments. Interestingly, the developed PC showed unconventional &#8220;oxygen acceleration&#8221; behavior for a variety of acrylic and acrylamide monomers in aqueous conditions without any additives, which is apparently distinct from previously reported systems. With such a PC, we successfully performed &#8220;grafting&#8208;from&#8221; polymerizations from protein in ambient buffer conditions under green LED irradiations, which results in various PPCs having neutral, anionic, cationic, and zwitterionic polyacrylates and polyacrylamides. We believe that our PC will be widely employed for a variety of photocatalysis in aqueous environments including the living cell system.

         <title>Multivariate Analysis Identifying [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+ Design and Device Architecture Enables First&#8208;class Blue and White Light&#8208;emitting Electrochemical Cells</title>

Abstract
White light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) comprising only [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+ have not been reported yet, as all the attempts towards blue&#8208;emitting complexes failed. Herein, a multivariate analysis based on prior&#8208;art [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+&#8208;based thin&#8208;film lighting (&gt;90 papers) and refined with computational calculations identified the best blue&#8208;emitting [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+ design for LECs, that is, N^N: 2&#8208;(4&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)phenyl)&#8208;6&#8208;(3,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine and P^P: 4,5&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene, to achieve predicted thin&#8208;film emission at 490&#160;nm and device performance of 3.8&#160;cd/A@170&#160;cd/m2. Validation came from the synthesis, X&#8208;ray structure, thin&#8208;film spectroscopic/microscopy/electrochemical characterization, and device optimization, realizing the first [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+&#8208;based blue&#8208;LEC with 3.6&#160;cd/A@180&#160;cd/m2. This represents a record performance compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art tri&#8208;coordinate Cu(I)&#8208;complexes blue&#8208;LECs (0.17&#160;cd/A@20&#160;cd/m2). Success/versatility were confirmed with the synthesis of the analogous complex with 2&#8208;(4&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)phenyl)&#8208;6&#8208;(3,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyrazine (N^N), showing a close prediction/experiment match: &#955;&#160;= 590/580&#160;nm; efficiency = 0.55/0.60&#160;cd/A@30&#160;cd/m2. Finally, an experimental design with a similar multivariate analysis was applied to fabricate the best white multicomponent host:guest LEC, significantly reducing the number of trial&#8208;error attempts towards the first white all&#8208;[Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+&#8208;LECs with 0.6&#160;cd/A@30&#160;cd/m2. This corresponds to ca. 10&#8208;fold enhancement with regards to previous [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+&#8208;based white&#8208;LECs (&lt;0.05&#160;cd/A@&lt;12&#160;cd/m2). Hence, this work sets in the first multivariate approach to design emitters/active layers, accomplishing first&#8208;class [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+&#8208;based blue/white LECs that were still elusive.

         <title>Constructing a Stable Interface Layer by Tailoring Solvation Chemistry in Carbonate Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvation chemistry in a commercial carbonate electrolyte is tailored by adding tetramethylurea cosolvent and an additive. As a result, a highly conductive and stable interface layer is constructed and lithium hexafluorophosphate decomposition is inhibited. This simple strategy can not only suppress Li&#8208;dendrite growth and hydrogen fluoride production to prolong cycle life, but also enhances the temperature tolerance of lithium&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) are considered as promising next&#8208;generation batteries due to their high energy density. However, commercial carbonate electrolytes cannot be used in LMBs due to their poor compatibility with the lithium&#8208;metal anode and detrimental hydrogen fluoride (HF) generation by lithium hexafluorophosphate decomposition. By introducing lithium nitrate additive and a small amount of tetramethylurea as a multifunctional cosolvent to a commercial carbonate electrolyte, NO3&#8722;, which is usually insoluble, can be introduced into the solvation structure of Li+ to form a conductive and stable solid electrolyte interface. At the same time, HF generation is suppressed by manipulating the solvation structure and a scavenging effect. As a result, the Coulombic efficiency (CE) of Li||Cu half cells using the designed carbonate electrolyte can reach 98.19% at room temperature and 96.14% at low temperature (&#8722;15&#160;&#176;C), and Li||LiFePO4 cells deliver a high capacity retention of 94.9% with a high CE of 99.6% after 550&#160;cycles. This work provides a simple and effective way to extend the use of commercial carbonate electrolytes for next&#8208;generation battery systems.

         <title>Stable Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Aluminum Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state aluminum batteries are constructed using quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte with high air stability, still operating well when exposed to air and if burning in fire, revealing a long&#8208;term air stability and high safety. The results offer a novel approach for designing highly stable and safe aluminum batteries, providing a feasible strategy to boost applications in grid&#8208;scale energy storage.








Abstract
Nonaqueous rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs) of low cost and high safety are promising for next&#8208;generation energy storage. With the presence of ionic liquid (IL) electrolytes, their high moisture sensitivity and poor stability would lead to critical issues in liquid RABs, including undesirable gas production, irreversible activity loss, and an unstable electrode interface, undermining the operation stability. To address such issues, herein, a stable quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte is developed via encapsulating a small amount of an IL into a metal&#8211;organic framework, which not only protects the IL from moisture, but creates sufficient ionic transport network between the active materials and the electrolyte. Owing to the generated stable states at both positive&#8208;electrode&#8211;electrolyte and negative&#8208;electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces, the as&#8208;assembled quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Al&#8211;graphite batteries deliver specific capacity of &#8776;75&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 (with positive electrode material loading &#8776;9&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, much higher than that in the conventional liquid systems). The batteries present a long&#8208;term cycling stability beyond 2000 cycles, with great stability even upon exposure to air within 2 h and under flame combustion tests.

     alt="Stable Quasi-Solid-State Aluminum Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stable quasi-solid-state aluminum batteries are constructed using quasi-solid-state electrolyte with high air stability, still operating well when exposed to air and if burning in fire, revealing a long-term air stability and high safety. The results offer a novel approach for designing highly stable and safe aluminum batteries, providing a feasible strategy to boost applications in grid-scale energy storage.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonaqueous rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs) of low cost and high safety are promising for next-generation energy storage. With the presence of ionic liquid (IL) electrolytes, their high moisture sensitivity and poor stability would lead to critical issues in liquid RABs, including undesirable gas production, irreversible activity loss, and an unstable electrode interface, undermining the operation stability. To address such issues, herein, a stable quasi-solid-state electrolyte is developed via encapsulating a small amount of an IL into a metal&#8211;organic framework, which not only protects the IL from moisture, but creates sufficient ionic transport network between the active materials and the electrolyte. Owing to the generated stable states at both positive-electrode&#8211;electrolyte and negative-electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces, the as-assembled quasi-solid-state Al&#8211;graphite batteries deliver specific capacity of &#8776;75&#160;mA h g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (with positive electrode material loading &#8776;9&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, much higher than that in the conventional liquid systems). The batteries present a long-term cycling stability beyond 2000 cycles, with great stability even upon exposure to air within 2 h and under flame combustion tests. Such technology opens a new platform of designing highly safe rechargeable Al batteries for stable energy storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strain Switching in van der Waals Heterostructures triggered by a Spin&#8208;Crossover Metal Organic Framework</title>

Abstract
Van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) provide the possibility of engineering new materials with emergent functionalities that are not accessible in another way. These heterostructures are formed by assembling layers of different materials used as building blocks. Beyond inorganic two&#8208;dimensional (2D) crystals, layered molecular materials remain still rather unexplored, with only few examples regarding their isolation as atomically thin&#8208;layers. Here, we enlarge the family of van der Waals heterostructures by introducing a molecular building block able to produce strain: the so&#8208;called spin&#8208;crossover (SCO). In these metal&#8208;organic materials, a spin transition can be induced by applying external stimuli like light, temperature, pressure or an electric field. In particular, smart vdWHs are prepared in which the electronic and optical properties of the 2D material (graphene and WSe2) are clearly switched by the strain concomitant to the spin transition. These molecular/inorganic vdWHs represent the deterministic incorporation of bistable molecular layers with other 2D crystals of interest in the emergent fields of straintronics and band engineering in low&#8208;dimensional materials.

         <title>Understanding Nanomaterial&#8208;Liver Interactions to Facilitate the Development of Safer Nanoapplications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanomaterials (NMs) are widely used in commercial and medical products, such as cosmetics, vaccines, and drug carriers. Exposure to NMs via various routes such as dermal, inhalation, and ingestion has been shown to gain access to the systemic circulation, resulting in the accumulation of NMs in the liver. The unique organ structures and blood flow features facilitate the liver sequestration of NMs, which may cause adverse effects in the liver. Currently, most in vivo studies were focused on NMs accumulation at the organ level and evaluation of the gross changes in liver structure and functions, however, cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific uptake and responses, as well as the molecular mechanisms at cellular levels linking the effects at organ levels are lagging. Herein, we systemically reviewed the diverse interactions of NMs with the liver, specifically on major liver cell types including Kupffer cells (KCs), liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), and hepatocytes as well as the detailed molecular mechanisms involved. In addition, we also reviewed the knowledge gained on nano&#8208;liver interactions that could facilitate the development of safer nanoproducts and nanomedicine.

         <title>Segregated array tailoring charge&#8208;transfer (CT) degree of organic cocrystal for the efficient near&#8208;infrared emission beyond 760&#160;nm</title>

Abstract
Harvesting the narrow bandgap excitons of charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complexes for the achievement of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission has attracted intensive attention for its fundamental importance and practical application. Herein, the triphenylene (TP)&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) CT organic complex was designed and fabricated via the supramolecular self&#8208;assembly process, which demonstrated the NIR emission with a maximum peak of 770&#160;nm and a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 5.4%. The segregated stacking mode of TP&#8208;F4TCNQ CT complex based on the multiple types of intermolecular interaction has a low CT degree of 0.00103 and a small counter pitch angle of 40o between F4TCNQ and TP molecules, which breaks the forbidden electronic transitions of CT state, resulting in the effective NIR emission. Acting as the promising candidates for the active optical waveguide in the NIR region beyond 760&#160;nm, the self&#8208;assembled TP&#8208;F4TCNQ single&#8208;crystalline organic microwires displayed an ultra&#8208;low optical&#8208;loss coefficient of 0.060&#160;dB/&#956;m. This work holds considerable insights for the exploration of novel NIR&#8208;emissive organic materials via an universal &#8220;cocrystal engineering&#8221; strategy.

         <title>Three Dimensional Microvascularized Tissue Models by Laser&#8208;Based Cavitation Molding of Collagen</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
3D tissue models recapitulating human physiology are important for fundamental biomedical research, and they hold promise to become a new tool in drug development. An integrated and defined microvasculature in 3D tissue models is necessary for optimal cell functions. However, conventional bioprinting only allows the fabrication of hydrogel scaffolds containing vessel&#8208;like structures with large diameters (&gt;100&#160;&#956;m) and simple geometries. Recent developments in laser photoablation enable the generation of this type of structure with higher resolution and complexity, but the photo&#8208;thermal process can compromise cell viability and hydrogel integrity. To address these limitations, the present work reports in&#8208;situ 3D patterning of collagen hydrogels by femtosecond laser irradiation to create channels and cavities with diameters ranging from 20 to 60&#160;&#956;m. In this process, laser irradiation of the hydrogel generates cavitation gas bubbles that rearrange the collagen fibers, thereby creating stable microchannels. Such 3D channels can be formed in cell&#8208; and organoid&#8208;laden hydrogel without affecting the viability outside the lumen and can enable the formation of artificial microvasculature by the culture of endothelial cells and cell media perfusion. Thus, this method enables organs&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip and 3D tissue models featuring complex microvasculature.

         <title>Magnetic Domain Confined Printing of Programmable Organic Microcrystal Assemblies for Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Large&#8208;scale assembly of organic micro/nanocrystals into well&#8208;defined patterns with programmable structures is essential for applications such as information encryption at both high data density and high security level. Here we develop a magnetic field assisted approach that produces programmable assemblies of organic microcrystals with various shapes and orientations, using the magnetic domains of underneath ferromagnetic metal microarrays as the printing templates. The diamagnetic microcrystals tend to aggregate in the regions of minimal field strength, and thus their assembly behavior is precisely controlled by the local field distribution on top of magnetic domains on substrate. The dynamic assembly process of microcrystal assemblies can be programmed upon the sequence of applied field, and their shape changes are &#8764;100% reproducible on a large scale (&gt;20000 sites over 1 cm2). These features of magnetically programable assemblies are ideally suited for information encryption, for which we demonstrate the encryption&#8208;decryption&#8208;erasing of multi&#8208;level information from a quick&#8208;response code pattern based on the microcrystal assemblies under magnetic field.

         <dc:description>
The similarities and differences in the charge carrier dynamics in organic solar cells and organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halide perovskite solar cells, two leading technologies in thin&#8208;film photovoltaics, are discussed, linking these back to the intrinsic material properties of organic and perovskite semiconductors, and how these factors impact on photovoltaic device performance is elucidated.








Abstract
The charge carrier dynamics in organic solar cells and organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halide perovskite solar cells, two leading technologies in thin&#8208;film photovoltaics, are compared. The similarities and differences in charge generation, charge separation, charge transport, charge collection, and charge recombination in these two technologies are discussed, linking these back to the intrinsic material properties of organic and perovskite semiconductors, and how these factors impact on photovoltaic device performance is elucidated. In particular, the impact of exciton binding energy, charge transfer states, bimolecular recombination, charge carrier transport, sub&#8208;bandgap tail states, and surface recombination is evaluated, and the lessons learned from transient optical and optoelectronic measurements are discussed. This perspective thus highlights the key factors limiting device performance and rationalizes similarities and differences in design requirements between organic and perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Tailoring Competitive Adsorption Sites by Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy on Cobalt Oxides to Enhance the Electrooxidation of Biomass</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrooxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMFOR) process is complicated, including the HMF and OH&#8722; jointly adsorbed and coupled with each other. In this work, the role of oxygen vacancies is investigated during HMFOR. It is found that the OH&#8722; tends to fill into Vo and participate in the dehydrogenation of HMF molecules, which can improve the catalytic activity of HMFOR.








Abstract
The electrooxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) offers a promising green route to attain high&#8208;value chemicals from biomass. The HMF electrooxidation reaction (HMFOR) is a complicated process involving the combined adsorption and coupling of organic molecules and OH&#8722; on the electrode surface. An in&#8208;depth understanding of these adsorption sites and reaction processes on electrocatalysts is fundamentally important. Herein, the adsorption behavior of HMF and OH&#8722;, and the role of oxygen vacancy on Co3O4 are initially unraveled. Correspondingly, instead of the competitive adsorption of OH&#8722; and HMF on the metal sites, it is observed that the OH&#8722; can fill into oxygen vacancy (Vo) prior to couple with organic molecules through lattice oxygen oxidation reaction process, which could accelerate the rate&#8208;determining step of the dehydrogenation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA) intermediates. With the modulated adsorption sites, the as&#8208;designed Vo&#8208;Co3O4 shows excellent activity for HMFOR with the earlier potential of 90 and 120&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 1 m KOH and 1 m PBS solution. This work sheds insight on the catalytic mechanism of oxygen vacancy, which benefits designing a novel electrocatalysts to modulate the multi&#8208;molecules combined adsorption behaviors.

         <title>Simultaneously Blocking Chemical Crosstalk and Internal Short Circuit via Gel&#8208;Stretching Derived Nanoporous Non&#8208;Shrinkage Separator for Safe Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;shrinkage nanoporous separator is designed for enhancing the safety of lithium&#8208;ion battery through a novel gel&#8208;stretching strategy. Both internal short circuit and chemical crossover within the battery are simultaneously prevented when the separator is employed. The results elucidate the underlying mechanism to ensure battery safety and highlight the design principles for advanced separators.








Abstract
The separator, an ionic permeable and electronic insulating membrane between cathode and anode, plays a crucial role in the electrochemical and safety performance of batteries. However, commercial polyolefin separators not only suffer from inevitable thermal shrinkage at elevated temperature, but also fail to inhibit the hidden chemical crosstalk of reactive gases such as O2, leading to often reported thermal runaway (TR) and hence preventing large&#8208;scale implementation of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, a nanoporous non&#8208;shrinkage separator (GS&#8208;PI) is fabricated via a novel gel&#8208;stretching orientation approach to eliminate TR. In situ synchrotron small angle X&#8208;ray scattering during heating clearly shows that the as&#8208;prepared thin GS&#8208;PI separator exhibits superior mechanical tolerance at high temperature, thus effectively preventing internal short circuit. Meanwhile, the unique nanoporous structure design further blocks chemical crosstalk and the associated exothermic reactions. Accelerating rate calorimetry tests reveal that the practical 1 Ah LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622)/graphite pouch cell using GS&#8208;PI nanoporous separator show a maximum temperature rise (dT/dtmax) of only 3.7&#160;&#176;C s&#8722;1 compared to 131.6&#160;&#176;C s&#8722;1 in the case of Al2O3@PE macroporous separator. Moreover, despite the reduced pore size, the GS&#8208;PI separator demonstrates better cycling stability than conventional Al2O3@PE separator at high temperature without sacrificing specific capacity and rate capability.

         <title>Extreme Environmental Thermal Shock Induced Dislocation&#8208;Rich Pt Nanoparticles Boosting Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An environmental high&#8208;temperature thermal&#8208;shock method is proposed to generate dislocation&#8208;rich Pt nanoparticles in a liquid&#8208;nitrogen cooling medium. Structural stress and thermal stress trigger the formation of dislocations. The fast&#8208;cooling rate makes dislocations kinetically frozen in nanoparticles. The strain induced by dislocations downshifts the d&#8208;band center of the Pt, leading to weakened adsorption energy between the metal and reaction intermediates.








Abstract
Crystal structure engineering of nanomaterials is crucial for the design of electrocatalysts. Inducing dislocations is an efficient approach to generate strain effects in nanomaterials to optimize the crystal and electronic structures and improve the catalytic properties. However, it is almost impossible to produce and retain dislocations in commercial mainstream catalysts, such as single metal platinum (Pt) catalysts. In this work, a non&#8208;equilibrium high&#8208;temperature (&gt;1400 K) thermal&#8208;shock method is reported to induce rich dislocations in Pt nanocrystals (Dr&#8208;Pt). The method is performed in an extreme environment (&#8776;77 K) created by liquid nitrogen. The dislocations induced within milliseconds by thermal and structural stress during the crystallization process are kinetically frozen at an ultrafast cooling rate. The high&#8208;energy surface structures with dislocation&#8208;induced strain effects can prevent surface restructuring during catalysis. The findings indicate that a novel extreme environmental high&#8208;temperature thermal&#8208;shock method can successfully introduce rich dislocations in Pt nanoparticles and significantly boost its hydrogen evolution reaction performance.

Monolithic integration of vertically stacked red (R), green (G), and blue (B) quantum dots (QDs), from chalcometallate RGB QD precursor films, with amorphous oxide semiconductor indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide phototransistor arrays for high&#8208;resolution active&#8208;matrix driving of color&#8208;selective multispectral photodetection is demonstrated. Efficient QD connectivity for reduced trap density and photopatternability essential for pixelation are achieved, which result in ultrahigh photosensitive optoelectronic properties.








Abstract
Color&#8208;selective multifunctional and multiplexed photodetectors have attracted considerable interest with the increasing demand for color filter&#8208;free optoelectronics which can simultaneously process multispectral signal via minimized system complexity. The low efficiency of color&#8208;filter technology and conventional laterally pixelated photodetector array structures often limit opportunities for widespread realization of high&#8208;density photodetectors. Here, low&#8208;temperature solution&#8208;processed vertically stacked full color quantum dot (QD) phototransistor arrays are developed on plastic substrates for high&#8208;resolution color&#8208;selective photosensor applications. Particularly, the three different&#8208;sized/color (RGB) QDs are vertically stacked and pixelated via direct photopatterning using a unique chelating chalcometallate ligand functioning both as solubilizing component and, after photoexposure, a semiconducting cement creating robust, insoluble, and charge&#8208;efficient QD layers localized in the a&#8208;IGZO transistor region, resulting in efficient wavelength&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;induced charge transfer. Thus, high&#8208;resolution vertically stacked full color QD photodetector arrays are successfully implemented with the density of 5500 devices cm&#8211;2 on ultrathin flexible polymeric substrates with highly photosensitive characteristics such as photoresponsivity (1.1 &#215; 104 AW&#8211;1) and photodetectivity (1.1 &#215; 1018 Jones) as well as wide dynamic ranges (&gt;150&#160;dB).

         <title>Versatile Preparation of Mesoporous Single&#8208;Layered Transition&#8208;Metal Sulfide/Carbon Composites for Enhanced Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mesoporous single&#8208;layered MoS2/carbon composite is successfully synthesized, which displays remarkable electrochemical performance for both sodium&#8208;ion batteries and sodium&#8208;ion full cells. The reaction mechanism is systematically investigated by in situ and ex situ characterizations. This work may be expected to guide the future design protocol for various mesoporous single&#8208;layered transition&#8208;metal sulfide/carbon composite materials.








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal sulfides are promising electrochemical energy storage materials due to their abundant active sites, large interlayer space, and high theoretical capacities, especially for sodium storage. However, the low conductivity and poor cycling stability at high current densities hamper their applications. Herein, a versatile dual&#8208;template method is reported to elaborate ordered mesoporous single&#8208;layered MoS2/carbon composite with high specific area, uniform pore size, and large pore volume. The single&#8208;layered MoS2 is confined in the carbon matrix. The mesopores between the composite nanorods provide fast electrolyte diffusion. The obtained nanocomposite shows a high sodium&#8208;storage capability, excellent rate capacity, and very good cycling performance. A capacity of 310 mAh g&#8722;1 can remain at 5.0 A g&#8722;1 after 2500 cycles. Furthermore, a sodium&#8208;ion battery (SIB) full cell composed of the MoS2/carbon composite anode and a Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode maintains a specific capacity of 330&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 1.0 A g&#8722;1 during 100 cycles. The mechanism is investigated by in situ and ex situ characterizations as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Light Intensity Analysis of Photovoltaic Parameters for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light intensity analysis of photovoltaic parameters is introduced as a simple method, allowing understanding of the dominating mechanisms limiting the device performance in perovskite solar cells. The method is based on the drift&#8208;diffusion model and is aimed at helping in the explanation of parasitic losses from the trap&#8208;assisted recombination or ohmic losses in devices.








Abstract
The number of publications on perovskite solar cells (PSCs) continues to grow exponentially. Although the efficiency of PSCs has exceeded 25.5%, not every research laboratory can reproduce this result or even pass the border of 20%. Unfortunately, it is not always clear which dominating mechanism is responsible for the performance drop. Here, a simple method of light intensity analysis of the JV parameters is developed, allowing an understanding of what the mechanisms are that appear in the solar cell and limit device performance. The developed method is supported by the drift&#8208;diffusion model and is aimed at helping in the explanation of parasitic losses from the interface or bulk recombination, series resistance, or shunt resistance in the perovskite solar cell. This method can help not only point toward the dominating of bulk or interface recombination in the devices but also determine which interface is more defective. A detailed and stepwise guidance for such a type of light intensity analysis of JV parameters is provided. The proposed method and the conclusions of this study are supported by a series of case studies, showing the effectiveness of the proposed method on real examples.

         <title>Biosensor&#8208;Enabled Multiplexed On&#8208;Site Therapeutic Drug Monitoring of Antibiotics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first electrochemical biosensor, with a synthetic&#8208;biology&#8208;enabled antibody&#8208;free assay, for temporal monitoring of piperacillin/tazobactam in exhaled breath condensate, along with a correlation study exploring the link between monitored drug levels, is presented. The validation of the findings with gold&#8208;standard measurements demonstrates the suitability of the system as a low&#8208;cost, rapid, and sample&#8208;independent tool for multiplexed on&#8208;site therapeutic drug monitoring.








Abstract
Personalized antibiotherapy ensures that the antibiotic concentration remains in the optimal therapeutic window to maximize efficacy, minimize side effects, and avoid the emergence of drug resistance due to insufficient dosing. However, such individualized schemes need frequent sampling to tailor the blood antibiotic concentrations. To optimally integrate therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) into the clinical workflow, antibiotic levels can either be measured in blood using point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT), or can rely on noninvasive sampling. Here, a versatile biosensor with an antibody&#8208;free assay for on&#8208;site TDM is presented. The platform is evaluated with an animal study, where antibiotic concentrations are quantified in different matrices including whole blood, plasma, urine, saliva, and exhaled breath condensate (EBC). The clearance and the temporal evaluation of antibiotic levels in EBC and plasma are demonstrated. Influence of matrix effects on measured drug concentrations is determined by comparing the plasma levels with those in noninvasive samples. The system's potential for blood&#8208;based POCT is further illustrated by tracking &#223;&#8209;lactam concentrations in untreated blood samples. Finally, multiplexing capabilities are explored successfully for multianalyte/sample analysis. By enabling a rapid, low&#8208;cost, sample&#8208;independent, and multiplexed on&#8208;site TDM, this system can shift the paradigm of &#8220;one&#8209;size&#8208;fits&#8208;all&#8221; strategy.

         <title>Ultrafast&#8208;Response/Recovery Flexible Piezoresistive Sensors with DNA&#8208;Like Double Helix Yarns for Epidermal Pulse Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hysteresis is a critical issue existing in textiles sensors. Distinct from the conventional methods, in this work, a biomimetic DNA&#8208;like double&#8208;helix structure is introduced into a textile&#8208;based pressure sensor, providing a twisting force to allow quick and sufficient recovery from the deformation. Ultimately, the hysteresis is largely inhibited together with an improved response/relaxation time.








Abstract
A key challenge in textile sensors is to adequately solve the hysteresis for more broad and exacting applications. Unlike the conventional strategy in integrating elastic polymers into the textile, the hysteretic issue is critically addressed here through the structural design of yarns to provide a twisting force. The underlying mechanism is fully discussed based on theory and modeling, which are in good agreement with experimental data. Impressively, the pressure sensor outperforms almost all reported textile&#8208;based sensors in terms of recovery index, which refers to the ability to overcome the lagged deformation reflected by the hysteresis (5.3%) and relaxation time (2&#160;ms). Besides, the sensor superiority is also demonstrated by way of its ultrafast response time (2&#160;ms). Thanks to these merits, this pressure sensor is demonstrated to be capable of monitoring epidermal pulses and meanwhile shows great potential to advance the standardization and modernization of pulse palpation in traditional Chinese medicine.

&lt;p&gt;A key challenge in textile sensors is to adequately solve the hysteresis for more broad and exacting applications. Unlike the conventional strategy in integrating elastic polymers into the textile, the hysteretic issue is critically addressed here through the structural design of yarns to provide a twisting force. The underlying mechanism is fully discussed based on theory and modeling, which are in good agreement with experimental data. Impressively, the pressure sensor outperforms almost all reported textile-based sensors in terms of recovery index, which refers to the ability to overcome the lagged deformation reflected by the hysteresis (5.3%) and relaxation time (2&#160;ms). Besides, the sensor superiority is also demonstrated by way of its ultrafast response time (2&#160;ms). Thanks to these merits, this pressure sensor is demonstrated to be capable of monitoring epidermal pulses and meanwhile shows great potential to advance the standardization and modernization of pulse palpation in traditional Chinese medicine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Ultrarobust and High&#8208;Performance Rotational Hydrodynamic Triboelectric Nanogenerator Enabled by Automatic Mode Switching and Charge Excitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charge excitation and automatic mode switching triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is proposed, which displays outstanding durability and electrical output at the same time. This work provides an ideal scheme for enhancing the mechanical durability and broadening the range of working frequency as well as improving the electrical output performance of TENGs.








Abstract
The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is an emerging technology for ambient mechanical energy harvesting, which provides a possibility to realize wild environment monitoring by self&#8208;powered sensing systems. However, TENGs are limited in some practical applications as a result of their low output performance (low charge density) and mechanical durability (material abrasion). Herein, an ultrarobust and high&#8208;performance rotational TENG enabled by automatic mode switching (contact mode at low speed and noncontact at high speed) and charge excitation is proposed. It displays excellent stability, maintaining 94% electrical output after 72&#160;000 cycles, much higher than that of the normal contact&#8208;mode TENG (30%). Due to its high electrical stability and large electrical output, this TENG powers 944 green light&#8208;emitting diodes to brightness in series. Furthermore, by harvesting water&#8208;flow energy, various commercial capacitors can be charged quickly, and a self&#8208;powered fire alarm and self&#8208;powered temperature and humidity detection are realized. This work provides an ideal scheme for enhancing the mechanical durability, broadening the range of working frequency, and improving the electrical output of TENGs. In addition, the high&#8208;performance hydrodynamic TENG demonstrated in this work will have great applications for Internet of Things in remote areas.

         <dc:description>
A renewable magnetic and optical field multi&#8208;assisted Li&#8211;O2 battery is developed with porous NiO on the Ni foam as a photoelectrode. The battery achieves an ultralow charge potential of 2.73&#160;V, a high energy efficiency of 96.7%, and good cycling stability. The effect mechanism of the improved battery performance with magnetic field and optical field is revealed.








Abstract
The photoassisted lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8211;O2) system has emerged as an important direction for future development by effectively reducing the large overpotential in Li&#8211;O2 batteries. However, the advancement is greatly hindered by the rapidly recombined photoexcited electrons and holes upon the discharging and charging processes. Herein, a breakthrough is made in overcoming these challenges by developing a new magnetic and optical field multi&#8208;assisted Li&#8211;O2 battery with 3D porous NiO nanosheets on the Ni foam (NiO/FNi) as a photoelectrode. Under illumination, the photogenerated electrons and holes of the NiO/FNi photoelectrode play a key role in reducing the overpotential during discharging and charging, respectively. By introducing the external magnetic field, the Lorentz force acts oppositely on the photogenerated electrons and holes, thereby suppressing the recombination of charge carriers. The magnetic and optical field multi&#8208;assisted Li&#8211;O2 battery achieves an ultralow charge potential of 2.73 V, a high energy efficiency of 96.7%, and good cycling stability. This external magnetic and optical field multi&#8208;assisted technology paves a new way of developing high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;O2 batteries and other energy storage systems.

         <title>Designing Artificial Vibration Modes of Piezoelectric Devices Using Programmable, 3D Ordered Structure with Piezoceramic Strain Units</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmable, 3D ordered structure with piezoceramic strain units (3D OSPSU) is proposed to artificially generate basic modes, such as flexural, extension, shear, torsion, and even coupled modes in a broad frequency band other than only at eigenfrequency. A five&#8208;degree&#8208;of&#8208;freedom micro&#8211;nano actuating platform based on only one 3D OSPSU is constructed, indicating the potential for nano&#8208;operation in microelectronic manufacturing.








Abstract
Piezoelectric ceramic devices, which utilize multifarious vibration modes to realize electromechanical coupling and energy conversions, are extensively used in high&#8208;technological fields. However, the excitation of basic modes is mainly subjected to natural eigenfrequency of ceramic devices, which is related to the structure and material parameters. Herein, inspired by metamaterial theory, a programmable, 3D ordered structure with piezoceramic strain units (3D OSPSU) is developed to artificially generate basic modes in a broad frequency band other than only in narrow eigenfrequency. A (2 &#215; 2 &#215; 2) arrayed, co&#8208;fired, multilayer 3D OSPSU is painstakingly designed and fabricated for generating basic modes, such as flexural, extension, shear, torsion, and even coupled modes at nonresonance. To validate the 3D OSPSU method, a five&#8208;degree&#8208;of&#8208;freedom micro&#8211;nano actuating platform based on only one co&#8208;fired multilayer ceramic is constructed. The proposed methodology provides a new paradigm for creating extraordinary material properties of piezoelectric ceramics and will inspire brand&#8208;new piezoelectric device designs.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D ferromagnetism Cr5Te8 single crystals with high crystallinity are successfully synthesized via a tube&#8208;in&#8208;tube chemical vapor deposition growth. The as&#8208;grown Cr5Te8 nanosheet shows air&#8208;stable and thickness&#8208;tunable ferromagnetic properties with strong out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin polarization, which open up new prospects for exploring 2D magnetism and spintronic device applications.








Abstract
2D magnetic materials have aroused widespread research interest owing to their promising application in spintronic devices. However, exploring new kinds of 2D magnetic materials with better stability and realizing their batch synthesis remain challenging. Herein, the synthesis of air&#8208;stable 2D Cr5Te8 ultrathin crystals with tunable thickness via tube&#8208;in&#8208;tube chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth technology is reported. The importance of tube&#8208;in&#8208;tube CVD growth, which can significantly suppress the equilibrium shift to the decomposition direction and facilitate that to the synthesis reaction direction, for the synthesis of high&#8208;quality Cr5Te8 with accurate composition, is highlighted. By precisely adjusting the growth temperature, the thickness of Cr5Te8 nanosheets is tuned from &#8776;1.2&#160;nm to tens of nanometers, with the morphology changing from triangles to hexagons. Furthermore, magneto&#8208;optical Kerr effect measurements reveal that the Cr5Te8 nanosheet is ferromagnetic with strong out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin polarization. The Curie temperature exhibits a monotonic increase from 100 to 160 K as the Cr5Te8 thickness increases from 10 to 30&#160;nm and no apparent variation in surface roughness or magnetic properties after months of exposure to air. This study provides a robust method for the controllable synthesis of high&#8208;quality 2D ferromagnetic materials, which will facilitate research progress in spintronics.

         <title>Tissue Engineering with Mechanically Induced Solid&#8208;Fluid Transitions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tissues composed of a collagenous core surrounded by an epithelial sheet serve as shape&#8208;programmable living matter. The shaping process involves solid to fluid transitions in the epithelium induced by mechanical perturbations, and the generation of spatially distributed surface stresses at the interfaces. Optochemical and microsurgical operations generate a new shape that is autonomously stabilized by the re&#8208;epithelization process.








Abstract
Epithelia are contiguous sheets of cells that stabilize the shape of internal organs and support their structure by covering their surfaces. They acquire diverse morphological forms appropriate for their specific functions during embryonic development, such as the kidney tubules and the complex branching structures found in the lung. The maintenance of epithelial morphogenesis and homeostasis is controlled by their remarkable mechanics&#8212;epithelia can become elastic, plastic, and viscous by actively remodeling cell&#8211;cell junctions and modulating the distribution of local stresses. Microfabrication, finite element modelling, light&#8208;sheet microscopy, and robotic micromanipulation are used to show that collagen gels covered with an epithelial skin serve as shape&#8208;programmable soft matter. The process involves solid to fluid transitions induced by mechanical perturbations, generates spatially distributed surface stresses at tissue interfaces, and is amenable to both additive and subtractive manufacturing techniques. The robustness and versatility of this strategy for engineering designer tissues is demonstrated by directing the morphogenesis of a variety of molded, carved, and assembled forms from the base material. The results provide insight into the active mechanical properties of the epithelia and establish methods for engineering tissues with sustainable architectures.

         <title>Silk Embolic Material for Catheter&#8208;Directed Endovascular Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Embolic materials today are clinically approved for achieving vascular occlusion. In this work, a biomaterial comprising silk fibroin and nanoclay is developed and optimized as a multifunctional embolic agent that offers both embolization and drug&#8208;delivery capabilities. The silk embolic material exhibits excellent transcatheter injectability, mechanical strength, biocompatibility, and hemocompatibility to serve as a catheter&#8208;directed embolic drug carrier for the treatment of vascular diseases.








Abstract
Embolization is a catheter&#8208;based minimally invasive procedure that deliberately occludes diseased blood vessels for treatment purposes. A novel silk&#8208;based embolic material (SEM) that is developed and optimized to provide tandem integration of both embolization and the delivery of therapeutics is reported. Natural silk is processed into fibroin proteins of varying lengths and is combined with charged nanoclay particles to allow visibility and injectability using clinical catheters as small as 600 &#956;m in diameter at lengths &gt;100&#160;cm.&#160;SEMs loaded with fluorochrome labeled bovine albumin and Nivolumab, which is among the most used immunotherapy drugs worldwide, demonstrate a sustained release profile in vitro over 28 days. In a porcine renal survival model, SEMs with labeled albumin and Nivolumab successfully embolize porcine arteries without recanalization and lead to the delivery of both albumin and Nivolumab into the interstitial space of the renal cortex. Mechanistically, it is shown that tissue delivery is most optimal when the internal elastic membrane of the embolized artery is disrupted. SEM is a potential next&#8208;generation multifunctional embolic agent that can achieve embolization and deliver a wide range of therapeutics to treat vascular diseases including tumors.

         <title>Ultrathin 2D NbWO6 Perovskite Semiconductor Based Gas Sensors with Ultrahigh Selectivity under Low Working Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D all&#8208;inorganic NbWO6 perovskite nanosheets with thicknesses down to 1.5 nm are synthesized for the fabrication of gas sensors, and the fabricated few&#8208;layer NbWO6&#8208;based semiconducting sensor exhibits fast H2S sensing speed with high selectivity and sensitivity at low temperature.








Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) detection with high selectivity and low working temperature is of great significance due to its strong toxicity both to the environment and to humans and also as an endogenous signaling molecule existing in various physiological processes. 2D perovskites with high carrier mobility are promising candidates for gas sensing; however, the development of stable and nontoxic 2D perovskites nanosheets still remains a challenge. Herein, 2D all&#8208;inorganic NbWO6 perovskite nanosheets with thicknesses down to 1.5&#160;nm are synthesized by liquid exfoliation, and the gas&#8208;sensing performance based on these ultrathin nanosheets is investigated. A few&#8208;layer NbWO6&#8208;based sensor exhibits fast H2S sensing speed (&lt;6 s) with high selectivity and sensitivity (S&#160;= 12.5 vs 50&#160;ppm) at low temperature (150&#160;&#176;C). A small variation of H2S concentration (&lt;0.5&#160;ppm) can be detected with a fully reversible resistance signal. This work sheds light on the development of high&#8208;performance gas sensors working in ambient conditions based on low&#8208;dimensional, nontoxic, and wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite semiconductors. The high carrier mobility, ultrathin structure, and soft nature make this type of 2D perovskite semiconductor an ideal material candidate for the fabrication of flexible, transparent, and wearable sensing devices in the future.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancy Injection as a Pathway to Enhancing Electromechanical Response in Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhanced electromechanical response in BaTiO3 thin films driven via local oxygen vacancy migration is observed via temperature dependent band excitation piezoresponse force microscopy. Observations are supported by finite element modeling, reactive force field, and density functional theory calculations pointing toward the discovery of a new method of enhancing functional responses in ferroelectrics.








Abstract
Since their discovery in late 1940s, perovskite ferroelectric materials have become one of the central objects of condensed matter physics and materials science due to the broad spectrum of functional behaviors they exhibit, including electro&#8208;optical phenomena and strong electromechanical coupling. In such disordered materials, the static properties of defects such as oxygen vacancies are well explored but the dynamic effects are less understood. In this work, the first observation of enhanced electromechanical response in BaTiO3 thin films is reported driven via dynamic local oxygen vacancy control in piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). A persistence in peizoelectricity past the bulk Curie temperature and an enhanced electromechanical response due to a created internal electric field that further enhances the intrinsic electrostriction are explicitly demonstrated. The findings are supported by a series of temperature dependent band excitation PFM in ultrahigh vacuum and a combination of modeling techniques including finite element modeling, reactive force field, and density functional theory. This study shows the pivotal role that dynamics of vacancies in complex oxides can play in determining functional properties and thus provides a new route toward&#8211; achieving enhanced ferroic response with higher functional temperature windows in ferroelectrics and other ferroic materials.

         <title>A Universal Nonhalogenated Polymer Donor for High&#8208;Performance Organic Photovoltaic Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two nonhalogenated polymers, PB1 and PB2, with different side&#8208;chain orientations and deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels are reported. In organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells, PB1 only produces a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.3%, while PB2 gives an outstanding PCE of 17.7%. More importantly, PB2 has good compatibility with various electron acceptors. PB2 achieves excellent PCEs of 18.4% and 27.1% for ternary OPV cells and indoor light photovoltaic devices, respectively.








Abstract
Nonhalogenated polymers have great potential in the commercialization of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells due to their advantage in low&#8208;cost preparation. However, non&#8208;halogenated polymers usually have high highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels and inferior self&#8208;aggregation properties in solution, thus resulting in low power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Herein, two nonhalogenated polymers, PB1 and PB2, are prepared. When the polymers are used to fabricate OPV cells with BTP&#8208;eC9, the PB1&#8208;based device only gives a PCE of 5.3%, while the PB2&#8208;based device shows an outstanding PCE of 17.7%. After the introduction of PBDB&#8208;TF as the third component, the PB2:PBDB&#8208;TF:BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based device with an optimal weight ratio of 0.5:0.5:1 achieves a PCE up to 18.4%. More importantly, PB2 exhibits good compatibility with various nonfullerene acceptors to achieve better PCEs than those of classical polymer (PBDB&#8208;T and PBDB&#8208;TF)&#8208;based devices. When PB2 is combined with a wide&#8208;bandgap electron acceptor (F&#8208;BTA3), this device shows excellent PCE of 27.1% and 24.6% for 1 and 10 cm2 devices, respectively, under light intensity of 1000 lux light&#8208;emitting diode illumination.

&lt;p&gt;Two nonhalogenated polymers, PB1 and PB2, with different side-chain orientations and deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels are reported. In organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells, PB1 only produces a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.3%, while PB2 gives an outstanding PCE of 17.7%. More importantly, PB2 has good compatibility with various electron acceptors. PB2 achieves excellent PCEs of 18.4% and 27.1% for ternary OPV cells and indoor light photovoltaic devices, respectively.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonhalogenated polymers have great potential in the commercialization of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells due to their advantage in low-cost preparation. However, non-halogenated polymers usually have high highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels and inferior self-aggregation properties in solution, thus resulting in low power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Herein, two nonhalogenated polymers, PB1 and PB2, are prepared. When the polymers are used to fabricate OPV cells with BTP-eC9, the PB1-based device only gives a PCE of 5.3%, while the PB2-based device shows an outstanding PCE of 17.7%. After the introduction of PBDB-TF as the third component, the PB2:PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9-based device with an optimal weight ratio of 0.5:0.5:1 achieves a PCE up to 18.4%. More importantly, PB2 exhibits good compatibility with various nonfullerene acceptors to achieve better PCEs than those of classical polymer (PBDB-T and PBDB-TF)-based devices. When PB2 is combined with a wide-bandgap electron acceptor (F-BTA3), this device shows excellent PCE of 27.1% and 24.6% for 1 and 10 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; devices, respectively, under light intensity of 1000 lux light-emitting diode illumination. These results provide new insight in the rational design of novel nonhalogenated polymer donors for further development of low-cost materials and broadening the application of OPV cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Zinc(I) Active Sites to Accelerate Nitrogen Reduction Kinetics for Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbon electrocatalyst with single Zn(I) sites is discovered to accelerate kinetics of hydrogenation process for efficient N2 reduction.








Abstract
Developing highly active and stable nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) catalysts for NH3 electrosynthesis remains challenging. Herein, an unusual NRR electrocatalyst is reported with a single Zn(I) site supported on hollow porous N&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers (Zn1N&#8211;C). The Zn1N&#8211;C nanofibers exhibit an outstanding NRR activity with a high NH3 yield rate of &#8776;16.1&#160;&#181;g NH3 h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.3&#160;V and Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 11.8% in alkaline media, surpassing other previously reported carbon&#8208;based NRR electrocatalysts with transition metals atomically dispersed and nitrogen coordinated (TM&#8208;Nx) sites. 15N2 isotope labeling experiments confirm that the feeding nitrogen gas is the only nitrogen source in the production of NH3. Structural characterization reveals that atomically dispersed Zn(I) sites with Zn&#8211;N4 moieties are likely the active sites, and the nearby graphitic N site synergistically facilitates the NRR process. In situ attenuated total reflectance&#8208;Fourier transform infrared measurement and theoretical calculation elucidate that the formation of initial *NNH intermediate is the rate&#8208;limiting step during the NH3 production. The graphitic N atoms adjacent to the tetracoordinate Zn&#8211;N4 moieties could significantly lower the energy barrier for this step to accelerate hydrogenation kinetics duing the NRR.

         <title>Homojunction Perovskite Quantum Dot Solar Cells with over 1&#160;&#181;m&#8208;Thick Photoactive Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a charge&#8208;transfer doping strategy to tune the carrier&#8208;type, P/N homojunction CsPbI3 perovskite QD solar cells are demonstrated; the P/N homojunction significantly improves the carrier dynamic process and outputs record high efficiency in a QD active layer with thickness over 1&#160;&#181;m, demonstrating great potential for the future printing manufacturing of QD PVs.








Abstract
The solution&#8208;processed solar cells based on colloidal quantum dots (QDs) reported so far generally suffer from poor thickness tolerance and it is difficult for them to be compatible with large&#8208;scale solution printing technology. However, the recently emerged perovskite QDs, with unique high defect tolerance, are particularly well&#8208;suited for efficient photovoltaics. Herein, efficient CsPbI3 perovskite QD solar cells are demonstrated first with over 1&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick active layer by developing an internal P/N homojunction. Specifically, an organic dopant 2,2&#8242;&#8208;(perfluoronaphthalene&#8208;2,6&#8208;diylidene) dimalononitrile (F6TCNNQ) is introduced into CsPbI3 QD arrays to prepare different carrier&#8208;type QD arrays. The detailed characterizations reveal successful charge&#8208;transfer doping of QDs and carrier&#8208;type transformation from n&#8208;type to p&#8208;type. Subsequently, the P/N homojunction perovskite QD solar cell is assembled using different carrier&#8208;type QDs, delivering an enhanced power conversion efficiency of 15.29%. Most importantly, this P/N homojunction strategy realizes remarkable thickness tolerance of QD solar cells, showing a record high efficiency of 12.28% for a 1.2&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick QD active&#8208;layer and demonstrating great potential for the future printing manufacturing of QDs solar cells.

         <title>Chirality Bias Tissue Homeostasis by Manipulating Immunological Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>

It is shown that pathology&#8208;mimetic M&#8208;nanofibrils&#8212;but not physiology&#8208;mimetic P&#8208;nanofibrils&#8212;act as a defense mechanism that upregulates M2 macrophage polarization and activates downstream immune signaling to restore tissue homeostasis. These findings provide a more practical, simple, and efficient material strategy for regulating macrophages to treat disease.








Abstract
The physiological chirality of extracellular environments is substantially affected by pathological diseases. However, how this stereochemical variation drives host immunity remains poorly understood. Here, it is reported that pathology&#8208;mimetic M&#8208;nanofibrils&#8212;but not physiology&#8208;mimetic P&#8208;nanofibrils&#8212;act as a defense mechanism that helps to restore tissue homeostasis by manipulating immunological response. Quantitative multi&#8208;omics in vivo and in vitro shows that M&#8208;nanofibrils significantly inhibit inflammation and promote tissue regeneration by upregulating M2 macrophage polarization and downstream immune signaling compared with P&#8208;nanofibrils. Molecular analysis and theoretical simulation demonstrate that M&#8208;chirality displays higher stereo&#8208;affinity to cellular binding, which induces higher cellular contractile stress and activates mechanosensitive ion channel PIEZOl to conduct Ca2+ influx. In turn, the nuclear transfer of STAT is biased by Ca2+ influx to promote M2 polarization. These findings underscore the structural mechanisms of disease, providing design basis for immunotherapy with bionic functional materials.

         <title>Double&#8208;Layer Nacre&#8208;Inspired Polyimide&#8208;Mica Nanocomposite Films with Excellent Mechanical Stability for LEO Environmental Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyimide&#8208;mica (PI&#8208;Mica) nanocomposite film with outstanding mechanical properties and atomic oxygen resistance is produced by integrating mica nanosheets with polyimide into a double&#8208;layer nacre&#8208;inspired structure with a much higher density of mica in the top layer. This unique microstructure and advantages of mica also impart the film with favorable resistance to ultraviolet, space debris, and high temperatures.








Abstract
Owing to their outstanding comprehensive performance, polyimide (PI) composite films are widely used on the external surfaces of spacecraft to protect them from the adverse conditions of low Earth orbit (LEO). However, current PI composite films have inadequate mechanical properties and atomic oxygen (AO) resistance. Herein, this work fabricates a new PI&#8208;based nanocomposite film with greatly enhanced mechanical properties and AO resistance by integrating mica nanosheets with PI into a unique double&#8208;layer nacre&#8208;inspired structure with a much higher density of mica nanosheets in the top layer. In addition, the unique microstructure and the intrinsic properties of mica also impart the nanocomposite film with favorable ultraviolet and high&#8208;temperature resistance. The comprehensive performance of this material is superior to those of pure PI, single&#8208;layer PI&#8208;mica, and previously reported PI&#8208;based composite films. Thus, the double&#8208;layer nanocomposite film displays great potential as an aerospace material for use in LEO.

         <title>Doping&#8208;Induced Dielectric Catastrophe Prompts Free&#8208;Carrier Release in Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general mechanism for the doping&#8208;induced insulator&#8211;conductor transition in organic semiconductors is proposed. Multiscale simulations unveil the high polarizability of dopant&#8211;semiconductor complexes and predict large nonlinear enhancements of the dielectric constant as the system approaches a dielectric instability (catastrophe) upon increasing doping. Such an enhanced screening frees charges from Coulomb barriers at concentrations of 5&#8211;10%, in accordance with experiments.








Abstract
The control over material properties attainable through molecular doping is essential to many technological applications of organic semiconductors, such as organic light&#8208;emitting diodes or thermoelectrics. These excitonic semiconductors typically reach the degenerate limit only at impurity concentrations of 5&#8211;10%, a phenomenon that has been put in relation with the strong Coulomb binding between charge carriers and ionized dopants, and whose comprehension remained elusive so far. This study proposes a general mechanism for the release of carriers at finite doping in terms of collective screening phenomena. A multiscale model for the dielectric properties of doped organic semiconductor is set up by combining first principles and microelectrostatic calculations. The results predict a large nonlinear enhancement of the dielectric constant (tenfold at 8% load) as the system approaches a dielectric instability (catastrophe) upon increasing doping. This can be attributed to the presence of highly polarizable host&#8211;dopant complexes, plus a nontrivial leading contribution from dipolar interactions in the disordered and heterogeneous system. The enhanced screening in the material drastically reduces the (free) energy barriers for electron&#8211;hole separation, rationalizing the possibility for thermal charge release. The proposed mechanism is consistent with conductivity data and sets the basis for achieving higher conductivities at lower doping loads.

         <title>A Dynamic and Self&#8208;Adapting Interface Coating for Stable Zn&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy is proposed for constructing a dynamic and adaptive volume change interface coating to stabilize zinc anodes and prepare poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)/TiO2&#8722;x as a reasonable artificial interface coating, which can provide continuous dynamic protection and induce rapid and uniform transfer of Zn2+. This provides an effective and feasible approach for the protection and practical application of zinc&#8208;metal anodes.








Abstract
The zinc (Zn)&#8208;ion battery has attracted much attention due to its high safety and environmental protection. At present, the critical issues of the generation of dendrites and the accumulation of dead Zn on the surface will lead to a sharp decline of the battery life. Zn dendrites can be inhibited to some extent by constructing an interface protective coating. However, the existing rigid coating method cannot maintain conformal contact with Zn due to the volume change of Zn deposition and will cause fracture irreversibly during the cycle. Here, a highly self&#8208;adaptable poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)/TiO2&#8722;x coating is developed that can dynamically adapt to volume changes and inhibit dendrites growth. PDMS has high dynamic and self&#8208;adaptability due to the crosslinking of the B&#8211;O bond. In addition, the rapid and uniform transfer of Zn2+ is induced by the oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich TiO2&#8722;x. The assembled cells still achieve 99.6% coulombic efficiency after 700 cycles at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The adaptive interface coating constructed provides a sufficient guarantee for the stable operation of the Zn anode.

         <title>Asymmetric Elimination Reaction on Chiral Metal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral intermetallic compounds are promising candidates to promote heterogeneous asymmetric catalysis. Combining experimental and theoretical surface science methods, enantiospecific control is demonstrated for a halogen elimination reaction with a difference in the debromination temperatures of the two surface enantiomers of up to an unprecedented 46 K on the prototypical chiral intermetallic PdGa{111} surfaces.








Abstract
The production of enantiopure materials and molecules is of uttermost relevance in research and industry in numerous contexts, ranging from nonlinear optics to asymmetric synthesis. In the context of the latter, dehalogenation, which is an essential reaction step for a broad class of chemical reactions, is investigated; specifically, dehalogenation of prochiral 5&#8208;bromo&#8208;7&#8208;methylbenz(a)anthracene (BMA) on prototypical, chiral, intermetallic PdGa{111} surfaces under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Asymmetric halogen elimination is demonstrated by combining temperature&#8208;programmed X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and density functional theory. On the PdGa{111} surfaces, the difference in debromination temperatures for the two BMA surface enantiomers amounts up to an unprecedented 46 K. The significant dependence of the dehalogenation temperature of the BMA surface enantiomers on the atomic termination of the PdGa{111} surfaces implies that the ensemble effect is pronounced in this reaction step. These findings evidence enantiospecific control and hence promote intrinsically chiral crystals for asymmetric on&#8208;surface synthesis.

         <title>Amine&#8208;Functionalized Carbon Nanodot Electrocatalysts Converting Carbon Dioxide to Methane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ amine functionalization is a general strategy that can be applied to nanoscale carbon catalysts, i.e., in the form of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) regardless of their crystal structure, to promote the selectivity and production rate of CH4 in CO2 electroreduction. Specifically, amine functionalized nitrogen&#8208;doped GQDs achieve CH4 Faradaic efficiency and partial current density of industrial relevance.








Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to methane (CH4), which can be used not only as fuel but also as a hydrogen carrier, has drawn great attention for use in supporting carbon capture and utilization. The design of active and selective electrocatalysts with exceptional CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion efficiency is highly desirable; however, it remains a challenge. Here a molecular tuning strategy&#8722;in situ amine functionalization of nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene quantum dots (GQDs) for highly efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion is presented. Amine functionalized nitrogen&#8208;doped GQDs achieve a CH4 Faradic efficiency (FE) of 63% and 46%, respectively, at CH4 partial current densities of 170 and 258&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, approximating to or even outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts. These GQDs also convert CO2 to C2 products mainly including C2H4 and C2H5OH with a maximum FE of &#8776;10%. A systematic analysis reveals that the CH4 yield varies linearly with amine group content, whereas the C2 production rate is positively dependent on pyridinic N dopant content. This work provides insight into the rational design of carbon catalysts with CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion efficiency at the industrially relevant level.

         <title>Polarimetric Image Sensor and Fermi Level Shifting Induced Multichannel Transition Based on 2D PdPS</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wide spectral response photodetector and polarimetric image sensor based on 2D palladium phosphide sulfide (PdPS) are designed. The photoresponse range of PdPS is from solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet to the near&#8208;infrared. The PdPS&#8208;based polarimetric imaging sensor achieves object imaging and hidden&#8208;target detection in complex environments.








Abstract
2D materials have been attracting high interest in recent years due to their low structural symmetry, excellent photoresponse, and high air stability. However, most 2D materials can only respond to specific light, which limits the development of wide&#8208;spectrum photodetectors. Proper bandgap and the regulation of Fermi level are the foundations for realizing electronic multichannel transition, which is an effective method to achieve a wide spectral response. Herein, a noble 2D material, palladium phosphide sulfide (PdPS), is designed and synthesized. The bandgap of PdPS is around 2.1&#160;eV and the formation of S vacancies, interstitial Pd and P atoms promote the Fermi level very close to the conduction band. Therefore, the PdPS&#8208;based photodetector shows impressive wide spectral response from solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared based on the multichannel transition. It also exhibits superior optoelectrical properties with photoresponsivity (R) of 1 &#215; 103 A W&#8722;1 and detectivity (D*) of 4 &#215; 1011 Jones at 532&#160;nm. Moreover, PdPS exhibits good performance of polarization detection with dichroic ratio of &#8776;3.7 at 808&#160;nm. Significantly, it achieves polarimetric imaging and hidden&#8208;target detection in complex environments through active detection.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic&#8208;Framework&#8208;Based Hydrogen&#8208;Release Platform for Multieffective Helicobacter Pylori Targeting Therapy and Intestinal Flora Protective Capabilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>

A metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;generation platform for the treatment of H. pylori is reported. This platform integrates inflammatory targeted adhesion, multieffectively antibacterial capability, inflammatory regulation, and gastric mucosa repair, and also avoids simultaneously the imbalance of gastrointestinal flora homeostasis.








Abstract
Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is the leading cause of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer, and gastric cancer. Antibiotics, as traditional method for eliminating H. pylori, have no targeting effect, which causes serious bacterial resistance and gut dysbacteriosis. Moreover, antibiotics can hardly address hyperactive inflammatory response or damaged gastric mucosal barrier caused by H. pylori infection. Here, a pH&#8208;responsive metal&#8211;organic framework hydrogen&#8208;generation nanoparticle (Pd(H)&#8202;@&#8202;ZIF&#8208;8) is reported, which is encapsulated with ascorbate palmitate (AP) hydrogel. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that the outer AP hydrogel can target and adhere to the inflammatory site through electrostatic interactions, and is then hydrolyzed by matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) enriching in inflammatory sites. The released Pd(H)&#8202;@&#8202;ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles are further decomposed by gastric acid to generate zinc ions (Zn2+) and hydrogen, thus effectively killing H. pylori, alleviating inflammation and restoring impaired gastric mucosa simultaneously. Unexpectedly, this metal&#8211;organic framework hydrogen&#8208;generation platform (Pd(H)&#8202;@&#8202;ZIF&#8208;8&#8202;@&#8202;AP) also has an effect toward avoiding the imbalance of intestinal flora, which thus provides a more precise, effective, and healthy strategy for the treatment of H. pylori infection.

         <title>Modeling the Triboelectric Behaviors of Elastomeric Nonwoven Fabrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An analytical model is developed for nonwoven&#8208;based triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) working at conductor&#8208;to&#8208;dielectric contact mode. The model fits well with different sets of experimental data at reasonable mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and suggests that nonwoven triboelectric output reaches a maximum at a specific thickness, solidity, or average fiber diameter when other structural parameters are fixed.








Abstract
Theoretical modeling of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) is fundamental to their performance optimization, since it can provide useful guidance on the material selection, structure design, and parameter control of relevant systems. Built on the theoretical model of film&#8208;based TENGs, here, an analytical model is introduced for conductor&#8208;to&#8208;dielectric contact&#8208;mode nonwoven&#8208;based TENGs, which copes with the unique hierarchical structure of nonwovens and details the correlation between the triboelectric output (maximum transferred charge density) and nonwoven structural parameters (thickness, solidity, and average fiber diameter). A series of styrene&#8211;ethylene&#8211;butylene&#8211;styrene nonwoven samples are fabricated through a melt&#8208;blowing process to map nonwoven structural features within certain ranges, while an ion&#8208;injection protocol is adopted to quantify the triboelectric output with superior consistency and reproducibility. With a database containing structural features and triboelectric output of 43 nonwoven samples, a good model fitting is achieved via nonlinear regression analysis in Python, which also shows good predictive power and suggests the existing of tribo&#8208;output maxima at a specific thickness, solidity, or average fiber diameter when other structural parameters are fixed. The model is also successfully applied to a group of polypropylene meltblown nonwovens, which verifies its universality on meltblown&#8208;nonwoven&#8208;based TENGs.

         <title>Extracellular Matrix in Synthetic Hydrogel&#8208;Based Prostate Cancer Organoids Regulate Therapeutic Response to EZH2 and DRD2 Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neuroendocrine prostate cancer is epigenetically transformed tumors for which no targeted therapies exist. Using a combination of transcriptomics, proteomics, spatial omics, and microscopy on patient biopsies, the extracellular matrix tumor microenvironment is defined. Informed by findings, synthetic hydrogel&#8208;based prostate cancer organoids are developed to grow patient tumor cells under the defined microenvironment conditions, leading to the discovery of novel therapeutics.








Abstract
Following treatment with androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibitors, &#8776;20% of prostate cancer patients progress by shedding their AR&#8208;dependence. These tumors undergo epigenetic reprogramming turning castration&#8208;resistant prostate cancer adenocarcinoma (CRPC&#8208;Adeno) into neuroendocrine prostate cancer (CRPC&#8208;NEPC). No targeted therapies are available for CRPC&#8208;NEPCs, and there are minimal organoid models to discover new therapeutic targets against these aggressive tumors. Here, using a combination of patient tumor proteomics, RNA sequencing, spatial&#8208;omics, and a synthetic hydrogel&#8208;based organoid, putative extracellular matrix (ECM) cues that regulate the phenotypic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic underpinnings of CRPC&#8208;NEPCs are defined. Short&#8208;term culture in tumor&#8208;expressed ECM differentially regulated DNA methylation and mobilized genes in CRPC&#8208;NEPCs. The ECM type distinctly regulates the response to small&#8208;molecule inhibitors of epigenetic targets and Dopamine Receptor D2 (DRD2), the latter being an understudied target in neuroendocrine tumors. In vivo patient&#8208;derived xenograft in immunocompromised mice showed strong anti&#8208;tumor response when treated with a DRD2 inhibitor. Finally, we&#160;demonstrate that therapeutic response in CRPC&#8208;NEPCs under drug&#8208;resistant ECM conditions can be overcome by first cellular reprogramming with epigenetic inhibitors, followed by DRD2 treatment. The synthetic organoids suggest the regulatory role of ECM in therapeutic response to targeted therapies in CRPC&#8208;NEPCs and enable the discovery of therapies to overcome resistance.

         <title>Simultaneous Realization of Superoleophobicity and Strong Substrate Adhesion in Water via a Unique Segment Orientation Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and versatile noncovalent coating strategy is provided to simultaneously realize underwater superoleophobicity and strong substrate adhesion based on a mixture of amphiphilic polyurethane and a water&#8208;miscible solvent. By immersing the coating in water, hydrophobic segments will orientate and pile along the substrate surface via a segment orientation mechanism. Hydrophilic segments will physically crosslink to a hydrogel surface.








Abstract
The underwater superoleophobicity of a coating is often caused by its preferential water affinity, which, however, normally weakens the substrate adhesion property. In this work, a new strategy is reported for achieving strong underwater adhesion between a well&#8208;designed amphiphilic polyurethane coating and a diverse range of substrates while also rendering the coating surface's superoleophobicity. When the coating, which is a mixture of an amphiphilic polyurethane and a water miscible solvent, is immersed in water, the hydrophobic segments aggregate to orientate and pile along the surface of substrates via a segment orientation mechanism triggered by solvent exchange with water penetration to exert strong adhesion. At the same time, the hydrophilic segments will physically crosslink to form a hydrogel coating, endowing the substrate with underwater superoleophobicity. This work provides a facile, versatile, and scalable approach for the future design of superoleophobic coatings in a water environment.

&lt;p&gt;A facile and versatile noncovalent coating strategy is provided to simultaneously realize underwater superoleophobicity and strong substrate adhesion based on a mixture of amphiphilic polyurethane and a water-miscible solvent. By immersing the coating in water, hydrophobic segments will orientate and pile along the substrate surface via a segment orientation mechanism. Hydrophilic segments will physically crosslink to a hydrogel surface.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underwater superoleophobicity of a coating is often caused by its preferential water affinity, which, however, normally weakens the substrate adhesion property. In this work, a new strategy is reported for achieving strong underwater adhesion between a well-designed amphiphilic polyurethane coating and a diverse range of substrates while also rendering the coating surface's superoleophobicity. When the coating, which is a mixture of an amphiphilic polyurethane and a water miscible solvent, is immersed in water, the hydrophobic segments aggregate to orientate and pile along the surface of substrates via a segment orientation mechanism triggered by solvent exchange with water penetration to exert strong adhesion. At the same time, the hydrophilic segments will physically crosslink to form a hydrogel coating, endowing the substrate with underwater superoleophobicity. This work provides a facile, versatile, and scalable approach for the future design of superoleophobic coatings in a water environment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design of Quasi&#8208;MOF Nanospheres as a Dynamic Electrocatalyst toward Accelerated Sulfur Reduction Reaction for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quasi&#8208;metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework (quasi&#8208;MOF) nanospheres are developed as a sulfur electrocatalyst, wherein abundant metal nodes that act as active sites are exposed, rendering strong lithium polysulfides absorbability. The dynamic structure evolution over the sulfur reduction reaction can effectively promote catalytic conversion of lithium polysulfides, leading to accelerated reaction kinetics. This quasi&#8208;MOF sulfur composite demonstrates a decent electrochemical performance with prolonged cycle lifespan.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are considered as one of the most promising next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries owing to their high energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the sluggish kinetics of the sulfur reduction reaction process, which is so far insufficiently explored, still impedes its practical application.&#160;Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are widely investigated as&#160;a sulfur immobilizer, but the interactions and catalytic activity of lithium polysulfides (LiPs) on metal nodes are weak due to the presence of organic ligands. Herein, a strategy to design quasi&#8208;MOF nanospheres, which contain a transition&#8208;state structure between the MOF and the metal oxide via controlled ligand exchange strategy, to serve as sulfur electrocatalyst, is presented. The quasi&#8208;MOF not only inherits the porous structure of the MOF, but also exposes abundant metal nodes to act as active sites, rendering strong LiPs absorbability. The reversible deligandation/ligandation of the quasi&#8208;MOF and its impact on the durability of the catalyst over the course of the electrochemical process is acknowledged, which confers a remarkable catalytic activity. Attributed to these structural advantages, the quasi&#8208;MOF delivers a decent discharge capacity and low capacity&#8208;fading rate over long&#8208;term cycling. This work not only offers insight into the rational design of quasi&#8208;MOF&#8208;based composites but also provides guidance for application in Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting White Light Printed Image Multiplexing by Fast Nanosecond Laser Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Up to four images are encoded in a single random plasmonic metasurface created by fast nanosecond laser processing. Each laser&#8208;induced pixel exhibits various colors in different observation modes, which can be controlled independently to enable multiplexing. The approach, different from holography, makes possible the observation of various images on the same support by the naked eye under different observation angles.








Abstract
Passive plasmonic metasurfaces enable image multiplexing by displaying different images when altering the conditions of observation. Under white light, three&#8208;image multiplexing with polarization&#8208;selective switching has been recently demonstrated using femtosecond&#8208;laser&#8208;processed random plasmonic metasurfaces. Here, the implementation of image multiplexing is extended, thanks to a color&#8208;search algorithm, to various observation modes compatible with naked&#8208;eye observation under incoherent white light and to four&#8208;image multiplexing under polarized light. The laser&#8208;processed random plasmonic metasurfaces enabling image multiplexing exhibit self&#8208;organized patterns that can diffract light or induce dichroism through hybridization between the localized surface plasmon resonance of metallic nanoparticles and a lattice resonance. Improved spatial resolution makes the image quality compatible with commercial use in secured documents as well as the processing time and cost thanks to the use of a nanosecond laser. This high&#8208;speed and flexible laser process, based on energy&#8208;efficient nanoparticle reshaping and self&#8208;organization, produces centimeter&#8208;scale customized tamper&#8208;proof images at low cost, which can serve as overt security features.

         <title>Dynamic Ligand Screening by Magnetic Nanoassembly Modulates Stem Cell Differentiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic screens of various sizes are elastically coupled to RGD&#8208;presenting surfaces with nanogaps. Large magnetic screens exhibiting low RGD distribution stimulate integrin clustering for mechanotransduction&#8208;dependent differentiation of stem cells, which can be dynamically hindered by lowering the nanogaps. Conversely, small magnetic screens facilitate stem cell adhesion and differentiation by dynamically raising the nanogaps.








Abstract
In native microenvironment, diverse physical barriers exist to dynamically modulate stem cell recruitment and differentiation for tissue repair. In this study, nanoassembly&#8208;based magnetic screens of various sizes are utilized, and they are elastically tethered over an RGD ligand (cell&#8208;adhesive motif)&#8208;presenting material surface to generate various nanogaps between the screens and the RGDs without modulating the RGD density. Large screens exhibiting low RGD distribution stimulate integrin clustering to facilitate focal adhesion, mechanotransduction, and differentiation of stem cells, which are not observed with small screens. Magnetic downward pulling of the large screens decreases the nanogaps, which dynamically suppress the focal adhesion, mechanotransduction, and differentiation of stem cells. Conversely, magnetic upward pulling of the small screens increases the nanogaps, which dynamically activates focal adhesion, mechanotransduction, and differentiation of stem cells. This regulation mechanism is also shown to be effective in the microenvironment in vivo. Further diversifying the geometries of the physical screens can further enable diverse modalities of multifaceted and safe unscreening of the distributed RGDs to unravel and modulate stem cell differentiation for tissue repair.

         <title>Ultrafast Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Transformation from Metal&#8211;Organic Framework to 2D Hydroxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is demonstrated that single crystallinity can be totally maintained even through dramatic structural changes, which only requires several seconds. Ultrathin 2D single crystals can be obtained by the strategy, which is difficult for traditional methods. This discovery illustrates the possibility of transforming from 3D frameworks to 2D inorganic single crystals, vastly expanding the research scope of the single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation.








Abstract
Single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformations have received considerable interest in crystal engineering, owing to providing a key platform for creating new materials. However, because of the limited tolerance of chemical bonds against the lattice strains, it is challenging to maintain the crystallinity when the structure changes dramatically. Here, a peculiar SCSC transformation from organic crystals to inorganic crystals, simultaneously achieving a drastic change in structure, connectivity, and dimension, is reported. As a demonstration, after reacting with liquid gallium, zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) can easily transform to 2D hydroxide single crystals. Interestingly, long&#8208;range ordered metallic atoms of hydroxide inherited from the ordered atomic arrangement of ZIF&#8208;8, but the connectivity is distinct. With good universality and extensibility, this transformation vastly expands the research scope of the SCSC transformations and provides a novel pathway for the synthesis of crystalline materials.

         <title>Interpolation between W Dopant and Co Vacancy in CoOOH for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interpolation principle between W dopant and Co vacancy with opposite modulation effect is proposed to tune the electronic structure of CoOOH for enhanced oxygen evolution reaction. As a result, near&#8208;optimal electronic states and near&#8208;ideal intermediate energetics are achieved, leading to high catalytic activity. Such an interpolation principle can open up a new methodology for efficient catalyst design.








Abstract
Electronic structure engineering via integrating two defect structures with opposite modulation effects holds the key to fully unlocking the power of a catalyst. Herein, an interpolation principle is proposed to activate CoOOH via W doping and Co vacancies for the oxygen evolution reaction. Density functional theory suggests opposite roles for the W dopant and the Co vacancy but a synergy between them in tuning the electronic states of the Co site, leading to near&#8208;ideal intermediate energetics and dramatically lowered catalytic overpotential. Experimental studies confirm the modulation of the electronic structure and validate the greatly enhanced catalytic activity with a small overpotential of 298.5&#160;mV to drive 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The discovery of the interpolation between dopants and vacancies opens up a new methodology to design efficient catalysts for various electrochemical reactions.

         <title>A Schottky&#8208;Barrier&#8208;Free Plasmonic Semiconductor Photocatalyst for Nitrogen Fixation in a &#8220;One&#8208;Stone&#8208;Two&#8208;Birds&#8221; Manner</title>

         <dc:description>
A Schottky&#8208;barrier&#8208;free plasmonic photocatalyst is designed out of oxygen&#8208;deficient semiconductor MoO3 spheres for efficient nitrogen photofixation. The abundant oxygen vacancies in the spheres &#8220;kill two birds with one stone.&#8221; They serve as active sites for nitrogen molecules and induce localized surface plasmon resonance simultaneously. Apparent quantum efficiencies of over 1% are recorded from 700&#160;nm up to 1064&#160;nm.








Abstract
Plasmonic photocatalysis has received much attention owing to attractive plasmonic enhancement effects in improving the solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency. However, the photocatalytic efficiencies have remained low mainly due to the short carrier lifetime caused by the rapid recombination of plasmon&#8208;generated hot charge carriers. Although plasmonic metal&#8211;semiconductor heterostructures can improve the separation of hot charge carriers, a large portion of the hot charge carriers are lost when they cross the Schottky barrier. Herein, a Schottky&#8208;barrier&#8208;free plasmonic semiconductor photocatalyst, MoO3&#8722;x, which allows for efficient N2 photofixation in a &#8220;one&#8208;stone&#8208;two&#8208;birds&#8221; manner, is demonstrated. The oxygen vacancies in MoO3&#8722;x serve as the &#8220;stone.&#8221; They &#8220;kill two birds&#8221; by functioning as the active sites for the chemisorption of N2 molecules and inducing localized surface plasmon resonance for the generation of hot charge carriers. Benefiting from this unique strategy, plasmonic MoO3&#8722;x exhibits a remarkable photoreactivity for NH3 production up to the wavelength of 1064&#160;nm with apparent quantum efficiencies over 1%, and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion efficiency of 0.057% without any hole scavenger. This work shows the great potential of plasmonic semiconductors to be directly used for photocatalysis. The concept of the Schottky&#8208;barrier&#8208;free design will pave a new path for the rational design of efficient photocatalysts.

         <title>3D Printed, Solid&#8208;State Conductive Ionoelastomer as a Generic Building Block for Tactile Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast photocurable, solid&#8208;state conductive ionoelastomer is designed for high&#8208;resolution 3D printing of soft ionic conductor with arbitrary architectures. The printed building blocks display excellent and temperature&#8208;tolerant electrical&#8211;mechanical properties, as well as can be programmed into 3D flexible tactile devices such as gyroid&#8208;based piezoresistive sensor and gap&#8208;based capacitive sensor, both of which exhibit sensitivities much higher than their bulky counterparts.








Abstract
Shaping soft and conductive materials into preferential architectures via 3D printing is highly attractive for numerous applications ranging from tactile devices to bioelectronics. A landmark type of soft and conductive materials is hydrogels/ionogels. However, 3D&#8208;printed hydrogels/ionogels still suffer from a fundamental bottleneck: limited stability in their electrical&#8211;mechanical properties caused by the evaporation and leakage of liquid within hydrogels/ionogels. Although photocurable liquid&#8208;free ion&#8208;conducting elastomers can circumvent these limitations, the associated photocurable process is cumbersome and hence the printing quality is relatively poor. Herein, a fast photocurable, solid&#8208;state conductive ionoelastomer (SCIE) is developed that enables high&#8208;resolution 3D printing of arbitrary architectures. The printed building blocks possess many promising features over the conventional ion&#8208;conducting materials, including high resolution architectures (even &#8776;50&#160;&#181;m overhanging lattices), good Young's modulus (up to &#8776;6.2&#160;MPa), and stretchability (fracture strain of &#8776;292%), excellent conductivity tolerance in a wide range of temperatures (from &#8722;30 to 80&#160;&#176;C), as well as fine elasticity and antifatigue ability even after 10&#160;000 loading&#8211;unloading cycles. It is further demonstrated that the printed building blocks can be programmed into 3D flexible tactile sensors such as gyroid&#8208;based piezoresistive sensor and gap&#8208;based capacitive sensor, both of which exhibit several times higher in sensitivity than their bulky counterparts.

         <title>3D Printed MXene Aerogels with Truly 3D Macrostructure and Highly Engineered Microstructure for Enhanced Electrical and Electrochemical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D printing method based on inkjet printing and unidirectional freeze casting is utilized to fabricate pristine Ti3C2Tx aerogels with truly 3D shapes and vertically aligned MXene sheets. 3D printed aerogels are proposed for flexible/wearable electronics due to their excellent electromechanical performance. Enhanced electrochemical performance of the micro&#8208;supercapacitors is attributed to the improved electrical conductivity and ionic diffusion achieved simultaneously.








Abstract
Assembling 2D materials such as MXenes into functional 3D aerogels using 3D printing technologies gains attention due to simplicity of fabrication, customized geometry and physical properties, and improved performance. Also, the establishment of straightforward electrode fabrication methods with the aim to hinder the restack and/or aggregation of electrode materials, which limits the performance of the electrode, is of great significant. In this study, unidirectional freeze casting and inkjet&#8208;based 3D printing are combined to fabricate macroscopic porous aerogels with vertically aligned Ti3C2Tx sheets. The fabrication method is developed to easily control the aerogel microstructure and alignment of the MXene sheets. The aerogels show excellent electromechanical performance so that they can withstand almost 50% compression before recovering to the original shape and maintain their electrical conductivities during continuous compression cycles. To enhance the electrochemical performance, an inkjet&#8208;printed MXene current collector layer is added with horizontally aligned MXene sheets. This combines the superior electrical conductivity of the current collector layer with the improved ionic diffusion provided by the porous electrode. The cells fabricated with horizontal MXene sheets alignment as current collector with subsequent vertical MXene sheets alignment layers show the best electrochemical performance with thickness&#8208;independent capacitive behavior.

         <title>Cr&#8208;Doped Pd Metallene Endows a Practical Formaldehyde Sensor New Limit and High Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D Cr&#8208;doped Pd metallene (Cr&#8208;Pdene) with few atomic layers as an advanced catalyst provides an anti&#8208;poisoning formaldehyde&#8208;to&#8208;CO2 means for the formaldehyde oxidation reaction. The Cr&#8208;Pdene&#8208;based practical electrochemical sensor can accurately detect ppb&#8208;level gaseous formaldehyde and micromolar&#8208;level liquid formaldehyde in indoor air and different foods with long&#8208;term stability, good repeatability, and high selectivity.








Abstract
Electrochemical sensors for detecting micromolecule organics are desirable for improving the perception of environmental quality and human health. However, currently, the electrochemical sensors for formaldehyde are substantially limited on the market due to the long&#8208;term unsolved problems of the low electrooxidation efficiency and CO poisoning issue of commercial Pd catalysts. Here, a 2D Cr&#8208;doped Pd metallene (Cr&#8208;Pdene) with few atomic layers is shown as an advanced catalyst for ultrasensitive and selective sensing of formaldehyde via a highly efficient formaldehyde electrooxidation. It is found that the doping of Cr into Pd metallene can efficiently optimize the electronic structure of Pd and weaken the interaction between Pd and CO, providing an anti&#8208;poisoning means to favor CO2 production and suppress CO adsorption. The Cr&#8208;Pdene&#8208;based electrochemical sensor exhibits one order of magnitude higher detection range and, especially, much higher anti&#8208;interference for formaldehyde than that of the conventional sensors. Most importantly, it is demonstrated that the Cr&#8208;Pdene can be integrated into commercializable wireless sensor networks or handheld instruments for promising applications relating to the environment, health, and food.

Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries
A &#8220;Quasi&#8208;MOF&#8221; nanosphere is introduced by Yongguang Zhang, Xin Wang, Zhongwei Chen, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2105541 as an efficient and durable sulfur electrocatalyst toward accelerated sulfur reduction reaction. The reversible de&#8208;ligandation/ligandation of this Quasi&#8208;MOF over the course of the electrochemical process endows its with excellent catalytic activity and remarkable durability. Attributed to these structural advantages, the Quasi&#8208;MOF delivers a decent discharge capacity and low&#8208;capacity fading rate over long&#8208;term cycling.

Perovskite Solar Cells
Light&#8208;intensity analysis of JV parameters is introduced by Yulia Galagan and Damian Glowienka in article number 2105920 as a simple method to allow understanding of the dominating mechanisms that limit device performance in perovskite solar cells. The method is based on the drift&#8211;diffusion model and is aimed at helping in the explanation of parasitic losses from trap&#8208;assisted recombination or ohmic losses in devices.

Nanocrystal Dislocations
Inducing dislocations is an efficient approach to generate strain effects in nanomaterials. In article number 2106973, Yanan Chen and co&#8208;workers report a non&#8208;equilibrium high&#8208;temperature thermal&#8208;shock method (HTS) to induce dislocations in nanocrystals by using liquid nitrogen. The dislocations induced by thermal and structural stress are frozen in nanoparticles. The extreme environmental HTS can introduce dislocations in Pt nanoparticles and improve hydrogen evolution reaction performance.

         <title>A Critical Outlook for the Pursuit of Lower Contact Resistance in Organic Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Though organic transistors have long been considered as a potential cornerstone technology for flexible electronics applications, their widespread commercialization in high&#8208;frequency circuits has been substantially impeded by high contact resistance. A review of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art reveals the pivotal role of the organic&#8208;semiconductor morphology and the key challenges now to be overcome, such as Fermi&#8208;level pinning and low charge&#8208;carrier densities.








Abstract
To take full advantage of recent and anticipated improvements in the performance of organic semiconductors employed in organic transistors, the high contact resistance arising at the interfaces between the organic semiconductor and the source and drain contacts must be reduced significantly. To date, only a small portion of the accumulated research on organic thin&#8208;film transistors (TFTs) has reported channel&#8208;width&#8208;normalized contact resistances below 100 &#937;cm, well above what is regularly demonstrated in transistors based on inorganic semiconductors. A closer look at these cases and the relevant literature strongly suggests that the most significant factor leading to the lowest contact resistances in organic TFTs so far has been the control of the thin&#8208;film morphology of the organic semiconductor. By contrast, approaches aimed at increasing the charge&#8208;carrier density and/or reducing the intrinsic Schottky barrier height have so far played a relatively minor role in achieving the lowest contact resistances. Herein, the possible explanations for these observations are explored, including the prevalence of Fermi&#8208;level pinning and the difficulties in forming optimized interfaces with organic semiconductors. An overview of the research on these topics is provided, and potential device&#8208;engineering solutions are discussed based on recent advancements in the theoretical and experimental work on both organic and inorganic semiconductors.

         <title>Challenges and Strategies of Low&#8208;Cost Aluminum Anodes for High&#8208;Performance Al&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Al, with the features of high specific capacity, low&#8208;cost, and abundant reserves, is promising for energy storage. The recent progress of Al anodes for various Al&#8208;based batteries is summarized. The challenges of Al anodes leading to a mismatch between theoretical and practical performance are discussed. Comprehensive strategies for Al anodes to boost the electrochemical performance are presented.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;growing market of electric vehicles and the upcoming grid&#8208;scale storage systems have stimulated the fast growth of renewable energy storage technologies. Aluminum&#8208;based batteries are considered one of the most promising alternatives to complement or possibly replace the current lithium&#8208;ion batteries owing to their high specific capacity, good safety, low cost, light weight, and abundant reserves of Al. However, the anode problems in primary and secondary Al batteries, such as, self&#8208;corrosion, passive film, and volume expansion, severely limit the batteries&#8217; practical performance, thus hindering their commercialization. Herein, an overview of the currently emerged Al&#8208;based batteries is provided, that primarily focus on the recent research progress for Al anodes in both primary and rechargeable systems. The anode reaction mechanisms and problems in various Al&#8208;based batteries are discussed, and various strategies to overcome the challenges of Al anodes, including surface oxidation, self&#8208;corrosion, volume expansion, and dendrite growth, are systematically summarized. Finally, future research perspectives toward advanced Al batteries with higher performance and better safety are presented.

The recent theoretical and experimental development of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts under near pH&#8208;neutral CO2 reduction conditions is reviewed and future opportunities are discussed. These electrocatalysts range from noble&#8208;metal oxides to nonprecious metal phosphides, carbonates, and (hydro)oxides. Density functional theory, and particularly machine learning, and operando characterizations are also included.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), which produces valuable fuels and chemicals under near&#8208;neutral conditions, offers a renewable approach to alleviate the global energy crisis as well as the increasing concerns on climate change. However, to implement this strategy, one of the major challenges, the sluggish kinetics of the paired oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at anode, needs to be surmounted. It is therefore highly desirable to explore high&#8208;performance and cost&#8208;effective OER electrocatalysts suitable for CO2RR conditions, which is very different from those widely investigated under acidic or alkaline conditions. In this review, the ongoing development of OER electrocatalysts under near pH&#8208;neutral CO2&#8208;saturated (bi)carbonate solutions are highlighted and the future opportunities are discussed. It is started with a brief introduction on OER paired with CO2RR, the relevant theoretical tools such as density functional theory (DFT) and particularly machine learning (ML), and the operando characterization techniques. Then, there are some detailed discussions of recent progress on the rational design of OER electrocatalysts under CO2RR conditions ranging from noble&#8208;metal oxides to nonprecious metal phosphides, carbonates, (hydro)oxides, and so on. Finally, a perspective for developing OER electrocatalysts integrated with CO2 electroreduction is proposed.

         <title>Bioactive Synthetic Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>

Synthetic polymers as intrinsically bioactive agents. This review presents new opportunities in the development of synthetic polymers with the ability to selectively recognize and bind biological targets, to exert anticancer and/or antibacterial activity, and others that can agglutinate or otherwise bind to viruses.








Abstract
Synthetic polymers are omnipresent in society as textiles and packaging materials, in construction and medicine, among many other important applications. Alternatively, natural polymers play a crucial role in sustaining life and allowing organisms to adapt to their environments by performing key biological functions such as molecular recognition and transmission of genetic information. In general, the synthetic and natural polymer worlds are completely separated due to the inability for synthetic polymers to perform specific biological functions; in some cases, synthetic polymers cause uncontrolled and unwanted biological responses. However, owing to the advancement of synthetic polymerization techniques in recent years, new synthetic polymers have emerged that provide specific biological functions such as targeted molecular recognition of peptides, or present antiviral, anticancer, and antimicrobial activities. In this review, the emergence of this generation of bioactive synthetic polymers and their bioapplications are summarized. Finally, the future opportunities in this area are discussed.

         <title>3D Bioprinting of Cell&#8208;Laden Hydrogels for Improved Biological Functionality</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review describes recent progress and future opportunities to design dual&#8208;stage crosslinked bioinks, which are gels both prior to and after printing. These active, living materials are composed of both acellular and cellular components. Engineering hydrogels with consideration of cells as an intrinsic component of the printed bioink will enable greater biofunctionality.








Abstract
The encapsulation of cells within gel&#8208;phase materials to form bioinks offers distinct advantages for next&#8208;generation 3D bioprinting. 3D bioprinting has emerged as a promising tool for patterning cells, but the technology remains limited in its ability to produce biofunctional, tissue&#8208;like constructs due to a dearth of materials suitable for bioinks. While early demonstrations commonly used viscous polymers optimized for printability, these materials often lacked cell compatibility and biological functionality. In response, advanced materials that exist in the gel phase during the entire printing process are being developed, since hydrogels are uniquely positioned to both protect cells during extrusion and provide biological signals to embedded cells as the construct matures during culture. Here, an overview of the design considerations for gel&#8208;phase materials as bioinks is presented, with a focus on their mechanical, biochemical, and dynamic gel properties. Current challenges and opportunities that arise due to the fact that bioprinted constructs are active, living hydrogels composed of both acellular and cellular components are also evaluated. Engineering hydrogels with consideration of cells as an intrinsic component of the printed bioink will enable control over the evolution of the living construct after printing to achieve greater biofunctionality.

         <title>Colloidal Quantum Dot Solar Cells: Progressive Deposition Techniques and Future Prospects on Large&#8208;area Fabrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Colloidally grown nanosized semiconductors yield extremely high&#8208;quality optoelectronic materials. Many examples have pointed to near perfect photoluminescence quantum yields, meaning non&#8208;radiative optical processes (losses) can be completely suppressed allowing for technology&#8208;leading materials as high purity color centers in display technology and emitters in LEDs. Furthermore, because of high chemical yield, and improved understanding of the surfaces, these materials, particularly colloidal quantum dots (QDs) can also be ideal candidates for other optoelectronic applications. Given the strong drive toward carbon neutrality and limiting climate change, electricity from solar photovoltaics will play a large role in the power generation sector. QDs have been developed and shown dramatic improvements over the past 15 years as photoactive materials in photovoltaics and have unique potential with various innovative deposition properties which could lead to exceptionally low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance devices. Once the key issues related to charge transport in optically thick arrays are addressed, QD&#8208;based photovoltaic technology could become a better candidate for practical application. In this article, w e show how the possibilities of different deposition techniques could bring QD&#8208;based solar cells to the industrial level and discuss the challenges for perovskite QD solar cells in particular, to achieve large&#8208;area fabrication for further advancing technology to solve pivotal energy and environmental issues.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Microenvironment&#8208;Activatable Polymer Nano&#8208;Immunomodulator for Precision Cancer Photoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;activatable polymer nano&#8208;immunomodulator comprising a near infrared&#8208;absorbing semiconducting polymer and an amphipathic polymer conjugated with a Toll&#8208;like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist via an acid&#8208;labile linker is developed. The synergistic activity of released immunogenic factors and precise activation of TLR7 pathways at a tumor site elicits effective adaptive antitumor response via an in&#160;situ vaccine&#8208;like function.








Abstract
Cancer nanomedicine combined with immunotherapy has become a promising strategy for treating cancer in terms of safety and potency; however, precise regulation of the activation of antitumor immunity remains challenging. Herein, a smart semiconducting polymer nano&#8208;immunomodulator (SPNI), which responds to the acidic tumor microenvironment (TME), for precision photodynamic immunotherapy of cancer, is reported. The SPNI is self&#8208;assembled by a near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;absorbing semiconducting polymer and an amphipathic polymer conjugated with a Toll&#8208;like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist via an acid&#8208;labile linker. Upon arrival at tumor site, SPNI undergoes hydrolysis and triggers an efficient liberation of TLR7 agonist in response to the acidic TME for dendritic cell activation. Moreover, SPNI exerts photodynamic effects for direct tumor eradication and immunogenic cancer cell death under NIR photoirradiation. The synergistic action of released immunogenic factors and acidic&#8208;TME&#8208;activated TLR7 agonist can serve as an in situ generated cancer vaccine to evoke strong antitumor activities. Notably, such localized immune activation boosts systemic antitumor immune responses, resulting in enhanced cytotoxic CD8+ T infiltration to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. Thereby, this work presents a general strategy to devise prodrug of immunotherapeutics for precise regulation of cancer immunotherapy.

Doxorubicin (DOX) and Ce6 exert a synergistic antitumor effect by intensifying cell DNA damage and activating apoptotic pathways, resulting in an excellent antitumor effect.








Abstract
Linear&#8211;dendritic block copolymer (LDBCs) are highly attractive candidates for smart drug&#8208;delivery vehicles. Herein, an amphiphilic poly[(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate] (POEGMA) linear&#8208;peptide dendritic prodrug of doxorubicin (DOX) prepared by reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization is reported. The hydrophobic&#8208;dye&#8208;based photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) is employed for encapsulation in the prodrug nanoparticles (NPs) to obtain an LDBCs&#8208;based drug&#8208;delivery system (LD&#8208;DOX/Ce6) that offers a combination cancer therapy. Due to the presence of Gly&#8211;Phe&#8211;Leu&#8211;Gly peptides and hydrazone bonds in the prodrug structure, LD&#8208;DOX/Ce6 is degraded into small fragments, thus specifically triggering the intracellular release of DOX and Ce6 in the tumor microenvironment. Bioinformatics analysis suggests that LD&#8208;DOX/Ce6 with laser irradiation treatment significantly induces apoptosis, DNA damage, and cell cycle arrest. The combination treatment can not only suppress tumor growth, but also significantly reduce tumor metastasis compared with treatments with DOX or Ce6 through regulating EMT pathway, TGF&#946; pathway, angiogenesis, and the hypoxia pathway. LD&#8208;DOX/Ce6 displays a synergistic chemo&#8208;photodynamic antitumor efficacy, resulting in a high inhibition in tumor growth and metastasis, while maintaining an excellent biosafety. Therefore, this study demonstrates the potential of the biodegradable and tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;responsive LDBCs as an intelligent multifunctional drug&#8208;delivery vehicle for high&#8208;efficiency cancer combination therapy.

         <title>A Low&#8208;Cost and Air&#8208;Stable Rechargeable Aluminum&#8208;Ion Battery</title>

An aluminum&#8208;based hydrated eutectic electrolyte composed of Al(ClO4)3&#183;9H2O and succinonitrile is developed for rechargeable aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs). The electrolyte is highly conductive, nonflammable, and air&#8208;stable. The charge/discharge process of this AIB follows Al3+ insertion/extraction, and three&#8208;electron transfer is realized.








Abstract
Rechargeable aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs) are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to the abundant reserves, low cost, and high capacity of the Al anode. However, the development of AIBs is currently hindered by the usage of AlCl3/1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium chloride electrolyte, which is expensive, highly corrosive, and extremely air&#8208;sensitive. Herein, a new hydrated eutectic electrolyte (HEE) composed of hydrated aluminum perchlorate and succinonitrile for low&#8208;cost, noncorrosive, and air&#8208;stable AIBs is reported. Crystal water in the hydrated aluminum perchlorate plays a vital role in forming the HEE, in which one H2O and five succinonitrile molecules coordinate with one Al3+ ion. The optimized ratio of Al(ClO4)3&#183;9H2O to succinonitrile is 1:12. When combining with the self&#8208;doped polyaniline cathode, the associated AIB delivers a high discharge capacity of 185 mAh g&#8722;1 over 300 cycles; and the charge/discharge mechanism in the HEE is studied experimentally and theoretically. The HEE is nonflammable, air&#8208;stable, and noncorrosive, thus enabling good air tolerance and facile fabrication of AIBs.

         <title>Tailoring Aggregation Extent of Photosensitizers to Boost Phototherapy Potency for Eliciting Systemic Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A discretely integrated nanofabrication platform (named Pt&#8208;ICG/PES) is reported to boost phototherapy potency and antitumor immunity. Tailoring the aggregation extent of indocyanine green (ICG) to an optimized state can simultaneously relieve photobleaching and aggregation&#8208;caused&#8208;quenching effects, maximizing phototherapy efficiency. Equipped with photodynamic therapy/photothermal therapy/chemotherapy, Pt&#8208;ICG/PES magnifies immunogenic cell death effect, exerting synergistic promotion effect of antitumor immunity.








Abstract
Phototherapy is effective for triggering the immunogenic cell death (ICD) effect. However, its efficacy is limited by low 1O2&#160;generation and photothermal conversion efficacy due to two irreconcilable obstacles, namely the aggregation&#8208;caused&#8208;quenching (ACQ) effect and photobleaching. In this work, a discretely integrated nanofabrication (DIN) platform (Pt&#8208;ICG/PES) is developed by facile coordination coassembly of cisplatin (Pt), photosensitizer molecules (indocyanine green (ICG)), and polymeric spacer (p(MEO2MA&#8208;co&#8208;OEGMA)&#8208;b&#8208;pSS (PES)). By controlling the ICG/PES feeding ratio, the aggregation of ICG can be easily tailored using PES as an isolator to balance the ACQ effect and photobleaching, thereby maximizing the phototherapy potency of Pt&#8208;ICG/PES. With the optimized ratio of each component, Pt&#8208;ICG/PES integrates the complementarity of photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, and chemotherapeutics to magnify the ICD effect, exerting a synergistic antitumor immunity&#8208;promoting effect. Additionally, temperature&#8208;sensitive PES enables photothermally guided drug delivery. In a tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model, Pt&#8208;ICG/PES elicits effective release of danger&#8208;associated molecular patterns, dendritic cell maturation, cytotoxic T lymphocytes activation, cytokine secretion, M2&#160;macrophage repolarization, and distal tumor suppression, confirming the excellent in situ tumor ICD effect as well as robust systematic antitumor immunity. Ultimately, a versatile DIN strategy is developed to optimize the phototherapeutic efficacy for improving antitumor effects and strengthening systemic antitumor immunity.

         <title>Oriented 2D Perovskite Wafers for Anisotropic X&#8208;ray Detection through a Fast Tableting Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new composition of 2D perovskite&#8212;4&#8208;fluorophenethylammonium bismuth iodide [(F&#8208;PEA)3BiI6] is reported, and large and oriented perovskite wafers over 1 cm2 are obtained through a facile and time&#8208;saving strategy by tableting disordered 2D perovskite powders. Consequently, the unique anisotropy of four&#8208;times conductivity difference between the vertical and lateral directions enables great potential application in hard X&#8208;ray detection.








Abstract
2D perovskite single crystals have emerged as excellent optoelectronic materials owing to their unique anisotropic properties. However, growing large 2D perovskite single crystals remains challenging and time&#8208;consuming. Here, a new composition of lead&#8208;free 2D perovskite&#8212;4&#8208;fluorophenethylammonium bismuth iodide [(F&#8208;PEA)3BiI6] is reported. An oriented bulk 2D wafer with a large area of 1.33 cm2 is obtained by tableting disordered 2D perovskite powders, resulting in anisotropic resistivities of 5 &#215; 1010 and 2 &#215; 1011&#160;&#937; cm in the lateral and vertical directions, respectively. Trivalent Bi3+ ions are employed to achieve a stronger ionic bonding energy with I&#8208; ions, which intrinsically suppress the ion&#8208;migration effect. Thus, the oriented wafer presents good capabilities in both charge collection and ion&#8208;migration suppression under a large applied bias along the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction, making it suitable for low&#8208;dosage X&#8208;ray detection. The large&#8208;area wafer shows a sensitive response to hard X&#8208;rays operated at a tube voltage of 120 kVp with the lowest detectable dose rate of 30 nGy s&#8208;1. Thus, the fast tableting process is a facile and effective strategy to synthesize large&#8208;area, oriented 2D wafers, showing excellent X&#8208;ray detection performance and operational stability that are comparable to those of 2D perovskite single crystals.

A novel kind of lateral organic light&#8208;emitting transistor with the incorporation of a charge&#8208;transport buffer layer (CTB&#8208;OLET) affords uniform RGB area emission with good gate tunable ability (ON/OFF ratio 106), high loop stability, and arbitrary tunability, enabling a high aperture ratio of over 80%, suggesting its great potential for next&#8208;generation display technology.








Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting transistors (OLETs), integrating the functions of an organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) and organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) in a single device, are promising for the next&#8208;generation display technology. However, the great challenge of achieving uniform area emission in OLETs with good stability and arbitrary tunability hinders their development in this field. Herein, an effective solution to obtain well&#8208;defined area emission in lateral OLETs by incorporating a charge&#8208;transport buffer (CTB) layer between the conducting channel and emitting layer is proposed. Comprehensive theoretical simulation and experimental results demonstrate redistributed potential beneath the drain electrode under the shielding effect of the CBT layer, resulting in a highly uniform current density. In this case, uniform recombination of balanced holes and electrons can be guaranteed, which is essential for the formation of area emission in the following OLETs. RGB OLETs with uniform area emission are constructed, which show good gate tunable ability (ON/OFF ratio 106), high loop stability (over 200 cycles) and high aperture ratio (over 80%) due to the arbitrary tunability of the device geometry. This work provides a new avenue for constructing area&#8208;emission lateral OLETs, which have great potential for display technology because of their good compatibility with conventional fabrication techniques.

The role of iodide as an additive in lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries is not well understood, especially in the charging process. The recent advances on LiI are reviewed and the synergistic effect with water is discussed. Alternative approaches for enabling the charging process are also provided.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8211;O2) batteries possess a high theoretical energy density, which means they could become a potential alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Nevertheless, the charging process of Li&#8211;O2 batteries requires much higher energy, due to the insulating nature of the discharge product. It has been revealed that the anion additive, lithium iodide (LiI), can tune the cell chemistry to form lithium hydroxide (LiOH) as the product and facilitate the kinetics during the charging process. Although numerous studies have been reported, the role of this additive is still under investigation. Herein, the recent advances focusing on the use of LiI in Li&#8211;O2 batteries are reviewed, its catalytic behavior on discharge and charge is discussed, and its synergistic effect with water is understood. The ambiguity existing among the studies are also revealed, and solutions to the current issues are introduced.

         <title>Encapsulation of Metallic Zn in a Hybrid MXene/Graphene Aerogel as a Stable Zn Anode for Foldable Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite anode of metallic zinc (Zn) in graphene&#8211;MXene aerogel is prepared for Zn&#8208;ion batteries. The Zn metal is completely encapsulated inside the host in a 3D microscale manner, which suppresses the side reactions and regulates the Zn deposition. Meanwhile, the aerogel, with excellent flexibility, achieves stable electrochemical performance for foldable Zn&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
A 3D host can effectively mitigate the dendritic growth of a zinc (Zn)&#8208;metal anode. However, the increased electrode/electrolyte reaction area using the 3D substrate accelerates the passivation and corrosion at the anode interface, ultimately degrading the electrochemical performance. Here, an oriented freezing process is used to create a flexible MXene/graphene scaffold. Based on the abundant zincophilic traits and micropores in the structure, Zn is densely encapsulated inside the host by the electrodeposition process. During cycling, the composite anode endows an in situ solid electrolyte interface with zinc fluoride at the electrode/electrolyte interface due to inherent fluorine terminations in MXene, efficiently inhibiting the dendritic growth. Furthermore, the design wherein bulk Zn is distributed in a 3D microscale manner suppresses hydrogen evolution reactions (3.8&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) and passivation, through in/ex situ tests. As a result, in a symmetrical cell test, the electrode has a long&#8208;cycling life of over 1000 h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. After continuous single folding followed by double folding, a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state foldable cell with the composite anode and a LiMn2O4 cathode (60% depth of discharge) maintains high&#8208;capacity retention of over 91%. This research presents a revolutionary encapsulating idea for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries, as well as foldable investigation.

         <title>Intracellular Condensates of Oligopeptide for Targeting Lysosome and Addressing Multiple Drug Resistance of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lysosome selective construction of biomolecular hydrogel with emerging biological functions provides a novel strategy for controlling cancer cell fates by inducing lysosomal&#8208;membrane permeabilization and addressing multidrug resistance in a tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model.








Abstract
Biomolecular condensates have been demonstrated as a ubiquitous phenomenon in biological systems and play a crucial role in controlling cellular functions. However, the spatiotemporal construction of artificial biomolecular condensates with functions remains challenging and has been less explored. Herein, a general approach is reported to construct biomolecular condensates (e.g., hydrogel) in the lysosome of living cells for cancer therapy and address multiple drug resistance induced by lysosome sequestration. Aromatic&#8208;motif&#8208;appended pH&#8208;responsive hexapeptide (LTP) derived from natural insulin can be uptaken by cancer cells mainly through caveolae&#8208;dependent endocytosis, ensuring the proton&#8208;triggered phase transformation (solution to hydrogel) of LTP inside the lysosome specifically. Lysosomal hydrogelation further leads to enlargement of the lysosome in cancer cells and increases the permeability of the lysosome, resulting in cancer cell death. Importantly, lysosomal assemblies can significantly improve the efficiency of current chemotherapy drugs toward multidrug resistance (MDR) cells in vitro and in xenograft tumor models. As an example of functional artificial condensates in lysosomes, this work provides a new strategy for controlling functional condensates formation precisely in the organelles of living cells and addressing MDR in cancer therapy.

         <title>Loading Single&#8208;Ni Atoms on Assembled Hollow N&#8208;Rich Carbon Plates for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Assembled hollow N&#8208;rich carbon plates with single&#8208;Ni atoms (Ni&#8208;NC(AHP)) are constructed using a novel dual&#8208;linker zeolitic tetrazolate framework (ZTF) as precursor. The open structure and high external surface area enable the Ni&#8208;NC(AHP) catalyst with fast mass transfer and highly exposed single&#8208;Ni sites towards efficient CO2 electroreduction.








Abstract
The rational design of catalysts&#8217; spatial structure is vitally important to boost catalytic performance through exposing the active sites, enhancing the mass transfer, and confining the reactants. Herein, a dual&#8208;linker zeolitic tetrazolate framework&#8208;engaged strategy is developed to construct assembled hollow plates (AHP) of N&#8208;rich carbon (NC), which is loaded with single&#8208;Ni atoms to form a highly efficient electrocatalyst (designated as Ni&#8208;NC(AHP)). In the carbonization process, the thermally unstable linker (5&#8208;aminotetrazole) serves as the self&#8208;sacrificial template and the other linker (2&#8208;methylimidazole) mainly serves as the carbon and nitrogen source to form hollow NC matrix. The formed Ni&#8208;NC(AHP) catalyst possesses enhanced mesoporosity and more available surface area, thus promoting mass transport and affording abundant accessible single&#8208;Ni sites. These features contribute to remarkable performance for electrochemical CO2 reduction with exceptionally high selectivity of nearly 100% towards CO in a wide potential range and dramatically enhanced CO partial current density.

         <title>Controllable SiOx Nanorod Memristive Neuron for Probabilistic Bayesian Inference</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A probabilistic SiOx nanorod memristive neuron is fabricated by employing the glancing angle deposition technique. Due to the SiOx nanorod structure, a multitude of Si switching filaments at many SiOx nanorod edges can be formed, leading to different probabilistic activation functions with controllability. Furthermore, the self&#8208;resting neural operation and probabilistic Bayesian inferences are also demonstrated with the fabricated device.








Abstract
Modern artificial neural network technology using a deterministic computing framework is faced with a critical challenge in dealing with massive data that are largely unstructured and ambiguous. This challenge demands the advances of an elementary physical device for tackling these uncertainties. Here, we&#160;designed and fabricated a SiOx nanorod memristive device by employing the glancing angle deposition (GLAD) technique, suggesting a controllable stochastic artificial neuron that can mimic the fundamental integrate&#8208;and&#8208;fire signaling and stochastic dynamics of a biological neuron. The nanorod structure provides the random distribution of multiple nanopores all across the active area, capable of forming a multitude of Si filaments at many SiOx nanorod edges after the electromigration process, leading to a stochastic switching event with very high dynamic range (&#8776;5.15 &#215; 1010) and low energy (&#8776;4.06 pJ). Different probabilistic activation (ProbAct) functions in a sigmoid form are implemented, showing its controllability with low variation by manufacturing and electrical programming schemes. Furthermore, as an application prospect, based on the suggested memristive neuron, we&#160;demonstrated the self&#8208;resting neural operation with the local circuit configuration and revealed probabilistic Bayesian inferences for genetic regulatory networks with low normalized mean squared errors (&#8776;2.41 &#215; 10&#8208;2) and its robustness to the ProbAct variation.

         <title>Mesenchymal Stem Cell&#8208;Derived Extracellular Vesicles with High PD&#8208;L1 Expression for Autoimmune Diseases Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;expressing programmed cell death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are prepared for autoimmune diseases treatment. As cell&#8208;free carrier, MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 restore tissue lesion by reshaping the local immune microenvironment via programmed cell death&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;1)/PD&#8208;L1 pathway, which may potentially provide a universal platform technique for the immunotherapy of various autoimmune diseases.








Abstract
Autoimmune diseases are the third most common disease influencing the quality of life of many patients. Here, a programmed cell death&#8208;ligand 1 + (PD&#8208;L1) mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) derived extracellular vesicles (MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1) using lentivirus&#8208;mediated gene transfection technology is developed for reconfiguration of the local immune microenvironment of affected tissue in autoimmune diseases. MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 exhibits an impressive ability to regulate various activated immune cells to an immunosuppressed state in vitro. More importantly, in dextran sulfate sodium&#8208;induced ulcerative colitis (UC) and imiquimod&#8208;induced psoriasis mouse models, a significantly high accumulation of MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 is observed in the inflamed tissues compared to the PD&#8208;L1+ MSCs. Therapeutic efficiency in both UC and psoriasis mouse disease models is demonstrated using MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 to reshape the inflammatory ecosystem in the local immune context. A technology is developed using MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 as a natural delivery platform for autoimmune diseases treatment with high clinical potential.

         <title>Textured Electrodes: Manipulating Built&#8208;In Crystallographic Heterogeneity of Metal Electrodes via Severe Plastic Deformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The large crystallographic heterogeneity, e.g., broad orientational distribution, characteristic of commercial metal foils results in rough electrodeposit morphology in either metal plating/stripping processes. An accumulative roll bonding (ARB) methodology is reported to achieve uniform crystallographic control on macroscopic materials. Electrochemical analysis shows that ARB can produce large improvements in reversibility of metal anodes.








Abstract
Control of crystallography of metal electrodeposit films has recently emerged as a key to achieving long operating lifetimes in next&#8208;generation batteries. It is reported that the large crystallographic heterogeneity, e.g., broad orientational distribution, that appears characteristic of commercial metal foils, results in rough morphology upon plating/stripping. On this basis, an accumulative roll bonding (ARB) methodology&#8212;a severe plastic deformation process&#8212;is developed. Zn metal is used as a first example to interrogate the concept. It is demonstrated that the ARB process is highly effective in achieving uniform crystallographic control on macroscopic materials. After the ARB process, the Zn grains exhibit a strong (002) texture (i.e., [002]Zn//ND). The texture transitions from a classical bipolar pattern to a nonclassical unipolar pattern under large nominal strain eliminate the orientational heterogeneity of the foil. The strongly (002)&#8208;textured Zn remarkably improves the plating/stripping performance by nearly two orders of magnitude under practical conditions. The performance improvements are readily scaled to achieve pouch&#8208;type full batteries that deliver exceptional reversibility. The ARB process can, in principle, be applied to any metal chemistry to achieve similar crystallographic uniformity, provided the appropriate temperature and accumulated strains are employed. This concept is evaluated using commercial Li and Na foils, which, unlike Zn (HCP), are BCC crystals. The simple process for creating strong textures in both hexagonal and cubic metals and illustrating the critical role such built&#8208;in crystallography plays underscores opportunities for developing highly reversible thin metal anodes (e.g., hexagonal Zn, Mg, and cubic Li, Na, Ca, Al).

         <title>Spatiotemporally Controllable Distribution of Combination Therapeutics in Solid Tumors by Dually Modified Bacteria</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methods capable of distributing antitumor therapeutics uniformly and durably throughout an entire tumor would be of great significance in maximizing their treatment efficacy but have proven to be extremely challenging. In this work, bacteria&#8208;mediated spatiotemporally controllable distribution of combination therapeutics is described in solid tumors, which can reprogram the immune microenvironment for optimizing antitumor efficacy.








Abstract
Methods capable of distributing antitumor therapeutics uniformly and durably throughout an entire tumor would be of great significance in maximizing their treatment efficacy, but they have proven to be extremely challenging. Here, bacteria&#8208;mediated spatiotemporally controllable distribution of combination therapeutics in solid tumors is reported to reprogram the immune microenvironment for optimizing antitumor efficacy. By combining synthetic biology and interfacial chemistry, bacteria are inside and outside concurrently modified to express photothermal melanin and to attach immune checkpoint inhibitors on their surface. Due to the nature of bacteria to colonize the hypoxia intratumoral environment, both therapeutic agents can be distributed homogenously and lastingly in tumors during ex vivo human and in vivo mouse studies. Spatiotemporally controllable localization of melanin can repeatedly generate a moderate yet uniform heating of the tumor upon light exposure in a broad treatment window. Combination with similarly localized inhibitors elicits a dual photothermally stimulated and checkpoint&#8208;blockade&#8208;mediated immune activation effect, synergistically reprogramming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Therapeutic values are demonstrated by significantly inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival of mice in both subcutaneous and orthotopic murine models. Colonization of dually modified bacteria paves an avenue for spatiotemporally controllable distribution of therapeutic drugs in solid tumors.

         <title>Wafer&#8208;Scale Electroactive Nanoporous Silicon: Large and Fully Reversible Electrochemo&#8208;Mechanical Actuation in Aqueous Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
For large&#8208;scale nanoporous silicon cantilevers in aqueous electrolytes, with laser cantilever bending experiments, electrosorption&#8208;induced mechanical stress generation of up to 600&#8201;kPa that is reversible and adjustable at will by low operation voltages of 1&#8201;V is demonstrated. A comparison with planar silicon surfaces reveals mechanistic insights on the observed electrocapillarity upon ion adsorption and desorption.








Abstract
Nanoporosity in silicon results in interface&#8208;dominated mechanics, fluidics, and photonics that are often superior to the ones of the bulk material.

&lt;p&gt;For large-scale nanoporous silicon cantilevers in aqueous electrolytes, with laser cantilever bending experiments, electrosorption-induced mechanical stress generation of up to 600&#8201;kPa that is reversible and adjustable at will by low operation voltages of 1&#8201;V is demonstrated.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanoporosity in silicon results in interface-dominated mechanics, fluidics, and photonics that are often superior to the ones of the bulk material. However, their active control, for example, by electronic stimuli, is challenging due to the absence of intrinsic piezoelectricity in the base material. Here, for large-scale nanoporous silicon cantilevers wetted by aqueous electrolytes, electrosorption-induced mechanical stress generation of up to 600&#8201;kPa that is reversible and adjustable at will by potential variations of &#8776;1&#8201;V is shown.

         <title>Cycloruthenated Self&#8208;Assembly with Metabolic Inhibition to Efficiently Overcome Multidrug Resistance in Cancers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cyclometalated Ru(II) complex, RuZ, is reported to be able to self&#8208;assemble and accumulate in high levels in multi&#8208;drug resistant cancer cells. RuZ significantly increases cancer cell death by dual metabolic inhibition and interactions with multiple biological targets. Overall, the results suggest that RuZ could represent a potential treatment for cancers including multi&#8208;drug resistant cancers.








Abstract
The synthesis and the evaluation of the efficacy of a cycloruthenated complex, RuZ, is reported, to overcome multi&#8208;drug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells. RuZ can self&#8208;assemble into nanoaggregates in the cell culture medium, resulting in a high intracellular concentration of RuZ in MDR cancer cells. The self&#8208;assembly significantly decreases oxygen consumption and inhibits glycolysis, which decreases cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels. The decrease in ATP levels and its low affinity for the ABCB1 and ABCG2 transporters (which mediate MDR) significantly increase the retention of RuZ by MDR cancer cells. Furthermore, RuZ increases cellular oxidative stress, inducing DNA damage, and, in combination with the aforementioned effects of RuZ, increases the apoptosis of cancer cells. Proteomic profiling analysis suggests that the RuZ primarily decreases the expression of proteins that mediate glycolysis and aerobic mitochondrial respiration and increases the expression of proteins involved in apoptosis. RuZ inhibits the proliferation of 35 cancer cell lines, of which 7 cell lines are resistant to clinical drugs. It is also active in doxorubicin&#8208;resistant MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231/Adr mouse tumor xenografts. To the best of our&#160;knowledge, the results are the first to show that self&#8208;assembled cycloruthenated complexes are efficacious in inhibiting the growth of MDR cancer cells.

         <title>Self&#8208;Complementary Zwitterionic Peptides Direct Nanoparticle Assembly and Enable Enzymatic Selection of Endocytic Pathways</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;activated assembly of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) using the zwitterionic peptide, LRGD, as a self&#8208;complementary, electrostatic binding moiety is illustrated. PEGylated peptide ligands containing the LRGD sequence are immobilized on the AuNPs. Cancer&#8208;specific enzymes, matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;9 (MMP&#8208;9), cleave the peptide ligands and subsequently unveil the LRGD moieties that promote multivalent, electrostatic interactions, leading to the assembly of the AuNPs.








Abstract
Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly in biological systems holds promise to convert and amplify disease&#8208;specific signals to physical or mechanical signals that can direct cell fate. However, it remains challenging to design physiologically stable self&#8208;assembling systems that demonstrate tunable and predictable behavior. Here, the use of zwitterionic tetrapeptide modalities to direct nanoparticle assembly under physiological conditions is reported. The self&#8208;assembly of gold nanoparticles can be activated by enzymatic unveiling of surface&#8208;bound zwitterionic tetrapeptides through matrix metalloprotease&#8208;9 (MMP&#8208;9), which is overexpressed by cancer cells. This robust nanoparticle assembly is achieved by multivalent, self&#8208;complementary interactions of the zwitterionic tetrapeptides. In cancer cells that overexpress MMP&#8208;9, the nanoparticle assembly process occurs near the cell membrane and causes size&#8208;induced selection of cellular uptake mechanism, resulting in diminished cell growth. The enzyme responsiveness, and therefore, indirectly, the uptake route of the system can be programmed by customizing the peptide sequence: a simple inversion of the two amino acids at the cleavage site completely inactivates the enzyme responsiveness, self&#8208;assembly, and consequently changes the endocytic pathway. This robust self&#8208;complementary, zwitterionic peptide design demonstrates the use of enzyme&#8208;activated electrostatic side&#8208;chain patterns as powerful and customizable peptide modalities to program nanoparticle self&#8208;assembly and alter cellular response in biological context.

         <title>Breaking the Efficiency Limit of Deep&#8208;Blue Fluorescent OLEDs Based on Anthracene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA) process can recycle nonradiative triplet excitons to radiative singlet excitons and enhance the efficiency of fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Conventionally, the theoretical limit of delayed emission ratio by the TTA process is known to be 37.5% in anthracene&#8208;based molecules. In this work, 48% of delayed emission ratio is achieved by TTA with carefully designed blue OLEDs.








Abstract
Triplet harvesting is important for the realization of high&#8208;efficiency fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA) is one triplet&#8208;harvesting strategy. However, for blue&#8208;emitting anthracene derivatives, the theoretical maximum radiative singlet&#8208;exciton ratio generated from the TTA process is known to be 15% in addition to the initially generated singlets of 25%, which is insufficient for high&#8208;efficiency fluorescent devices. In this study, nearly 25% of the radiative singlet&#8208;exciton ratio is realized by TTA using an anthracene derivative, breaking the theoretical limit. As a result, efficient deep&#8208;blue TTA fluorescent devices are developed, exhibiting external quantum efficiencies of 10.2% and 8.6% with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage color coordinates of (0.134, 0.131) and (0.137, 0.076), respectively. The theoretical model provided herein explains the experimental results considering both the TTA and reverse intersystem crossing to a singlet state from higher triplet states formed by the TTA, clearly demonstrating that the radiative singlet ratio generated from TTA can reach 37.5% (total radiative singlet&#8208;exciton ratio: 62.5%), well above 15% (total 40%), despite the molecule having S1, T2&#160;&lt;&#160;2T1&#160;&lt; Q1 energy levels, which will lead to the development of high&#8208;efficiency fluorescent OLEDs with external quantum efficiencies exceeding 28% if the outcoupling efficiency is 45%.

         <title>Viologen&#8208;Immobilized 2D Polymer Film Enabling Highly Efficient Electrochromic Device for Solar&#8208;Powered Smart Window</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully crystalline viologen&#8208;immobilized 2D polymer (V2DP) film is synthesized, which enables high utilization of viologen moieties and fast ion transport. On this basis, the as&#8208;fabricated V2DP&#8208;based ECDs exhibit a rapid switching speed, and a high coloration efficiency (989 cm2 C&#8722;1). Furthermore, the highly efficient V2DP ECDs are vertically integrated with transparent solar cells, thereby generating energy&#8208;saving EC window systems.








Abstract
Electrochromic devices (ECDs) have emerged as a unique class of optoelectronic devices for the development of smart windows. However, current ECDs typically suffer from low coloration efficiency (CE) and high energy consumption, which have thus hindered their practical applications, especially as components in solar&#8208;powered EC windows. Here, the high&#8208;performance ECDs with a fully crystalline viologen&#8208;immobilized 2D polymer (V2DP) thin film as the color&#8208;switching layer is demonstrated. The high density of vertically oriented pore channels (pore size &#8776; 4.5&#160;nm; pore density &#8776; 5.8 &#215; 1016 m&#8208;2) in the synthetic V2DP film enables high utilization of redox&#8208;active viologen moieties and benefits for Li+ ion diffusion/transport. As a result, the as&#8208;fabricated ECDs achieve a rapid switching speed (coloration, 2.8 s; bleaching, 1.2 s), and a high CE (989 cm2 C&#8208;1), and low energy consumption (21.1 &#181;W cm&#8208;2). Moreover, it is managed to fabricate transmission&#8208;tunable, self&#8208;sustainable EC window prototypes by vertically integrating the V2DP ECDs with transparent solar cells. This work sheds light on designing electroactive 2D polymers with molecular precision for optoelectronics and paves a practical route toward developing self&#8208;powered EC windows to offset the electricity consumption of buildings.

&lt;p&gt;Fully crystalline viologen-immobilized 2D polymer (&lt;b&gt;V2DP&lt;/b&gt;) film is synthesized, which enables high utilization of viologen moieties and fast ion transport. On this basis, the as-fabricated &lt;b&gt;V2DP&lt;/b&gt;-based ECDs exhibit a rapid switching speed, and a high coloration efficiency (989 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; C&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Furthermore, the highly efficient &lt;b&gt;V2DP&lt;/b&gt; ECDs are vertically integrated with transparent solar cells, thereby generating energy-saving EC window systems.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochromic devices (ECDs) have emerged as a unique class of optoelectronic devices for the development of smart windows. However, current ECDs typically suffer from low coloration efficiency (CE) and high energy consumption, which have thus hindered their practical applications, especially as components in solar-powered EC windows. Here, the high-performance ECDs with a fully crystalline viologen-immobilized 2D polymer (&lt;b&gt;V2DP&lt;/b&gt;) thin film as the color-switching layer is demonstrated. The high density of vertically oriented pore channels (pore size &#8776; 4.5&#160;nm; pore density &#8776; 5.8 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;) in the synthetic &lt;b&gt;V2DP&lt;/b&gt; film enables high utilization of redox-active viologen moieties and benefits for Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion diffusion/transport. As a result, the as-fabricated ECDs achieve a rapid switching speed (coloration, 2.8 s; bleaching, 1.2 s), and a high CE (989 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; C&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), and low energy consumption (21.1 &#181;W cm&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;). Moreover, it is managed to fabricate transmission-tunable, self-sustainable EC window prototypes by vertically integrating the &lt;b&gt;V2DP&lt;/b&gt; ECDs with transparent solar cells. This work sheds light on designing electroactive 2D polymers with molecular precision for optoelectronics and paves a practical route toward developing self-powered EC windows to offset the electricity consumption of buildings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Universal Existence of Localized Single&#8208;Photon Emitters in the Perovskite Film of All&#8208;Inorganic CsPbBr3 Microcrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;photon emitters are universally observed from all&#8208;inorganic perovskite films at the cryogenic temperature, owing to local thickness variations of the composing CsPbBr3 microcrystals and the resulting low potential&#8208;energy regions. The discovery of such novel emitting species in a perovskite film, with the enriched structure&#8211;property relationship, will impart significant influences on the advancement of relevant optoelectronic devices and quantum&#8208;light sources.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic halide perovskites have drawn a lot of research attention very recently owing to their potential solution to the instability issue currently faced by the organic&#8211;inorganic counterparts. Meanwhile, the halide perovskites in a solid film are manifested as microscale morphologies whose functionalities are unavoidably affected by the interior or exterior presence of various nanoscale entities. Here all&#8208;inorganic solid films are fabricated with varying densities of single CsPbBr3 microcrystals, showing that very sharp photoluminescence peaks can be universally observed at 4 K with the linewidths being as narrow as hundreds of &#956;eV. The single&#8208;photon emission nature is confirmed for such a photoluminescence peak, whose intensity is completely quenched above &#8776;30&#160;K to suggest its possible origin from a low potential&#8208;energy region of the single microcrystal. The discovery of such a novel emitting species in halide perovskites, with the enriched structure&#8211;property relationship, will surely impart significant influences on the advancement of relevant optoelectronic devices and quantum&#8208;light sources.

         <title>Designing a Zn&#8211;Ag Catalyst Matrix and Electrolyzer System for CO2 Conversion to CO and Beyond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalysts, electrodes, and membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) are developed for the electrocatalytic conversion of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO and beyond. The system consists of highly porous Ag dispersed in a Zn matrix, which leads to high CO2 utilization as described by multiphysics modeling. Coupling to microbiology allows for further upgrading to multicarbon products.








Abstract
CO2 emissions can be transformed into high&#8208;added&#8208;value commodities through CO2 electrocatalysis; however, efficient low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts are needed for global scale&#8208;up. Inspired by other emerging technologies, the authors report the development of a gas diffusion electrode containing highly dispersed Ag sites in a low&#8208;cost Zn matrix. This catalyst shows unprecedented Ag mass activity for CO production: &#8722;614&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 0.17&#160;mg&#160;of Ag. Subsequent electrolyte engineering demonstrates that halide anions can further improve stability and activity of the Zn&#8211;Ag catalyst, outperforming pure Ag and Au. Membrane electrode assemblies are constructed and coupled to a microbial process that converts the CO to acetate and ethanol. Combined, these concepts present pathways to design catalysts and systems for CO2 conversion toward sought&#8208;after products.

         <title>Manipulating Color Emission in 2D Hybrid Perovskites by Fine Tuning Halide Segregation: A Transparent Green Emitter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled halide substitution in low&#8208;dimensional hybrid perovskites is an effective strategy to vary the material bandgap, obtaining a palette of light emitters, whereby transparent thin films emitting in the green are realized. By fine&#8208;tuning the halide content, nanoscale phase segregation happens, resulting in a controlled nanoscale spatial distribution of recombination centers.








Abstract
Halide perovskite materials offer an ideal playground for easily tuning their color and, accordingly, the spectral range of their emitted light. In contrast to common procedures, this work demonstrates that halide substitution in Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites not only progressively modulates the bandgap, but it can also be a powerful tool to control the nanoscale phase segregation&#8212;by adjusting the halide ratio and therefore the spatial distribution of recombination centers. As a result, thin films of chloride&#8208;rich perovskite are engineered&#8212;which appear transparent to the human eye&#8212;with controlled tunable emission in the green. This is due to a rational halide substitution with iodide or bromide leading to a spatial distribution of phases where the minor component is responsible for the tunable emission, as identified by combined hyperspectral photoluminescence imaging and elemental mapping. This work paves the way for the next generation of highly tunable transparent emissive materials, which can be used as light&#8208;emitting pixels in advanced and low&#8208;cost optoelectronics.

         <title>Lead&#8208;Dominated Hyperfine Interaction Impacting the Carrier Spin Dynamics in Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building up on the excellent optical properties of perovskite materials, the electron and hole spin dynamics provide fundamental insights into the carrier&#8211;nuclear spin system. In the model perovskite, bulk FA0.9Cs0.1PbI2.8Br0.2, Land&#233; factors, key spin relaxation times, and mechanisms are determined. Optically detected NMR reveals the dominance of the lead spin hyperfine interaction at the top of the valence band.








Abstract
The outstanding optical quality of lead halide perovskites inspires studies of their potential for the optical control of carrier spins as pursued in other materials. Entering largely uncharted territory, time&#8208;resolved pump&#8211;probe Kerr rotation is used to explore the coherent spin dynamics of electrons and holes in bulk formamidinium caesium lead iodine bromide (FA0.9Cs0.1PbI2.8Br0.2) and to determine key parameters characterizing interactions of their spins, such as the g&#8208;factors and relaxation times. The demonstrated long spin dynamics and narrow g&#8208;factor distribution prove the perovskites as promising competitors for conventional semiconductors in spintronics. The dynamic nuclear polarization via spin&#8208;oriented holes is realized and the identification of the lead (207Pb) isotope in optically detected nuclear magnetic resonance proves that the hole&#8211;nuclei interaction is dominated by the lead ions. A detailed theoretical analysis accounting for the specifics of the lead halide perovskite materials allows the evaluation of the underlying hyperfine interaction constants, both for electrons and holes. Recombination and spin dynamics evidence that at low temperatures, photogenerated electrons and holes are localized at different regions of the perovskite crystal, resulting in their long lifetimes up to 44&#160;&#956;s. The findings form the base for the tailored development of spin&#8208;optoelectronic applications for the large family of lead halide perovskites and their&#160;nanostructures.

         <title>Coupling Spin Defects in a Layered Material to Nanoscale Plasmonic Cavities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of plasmonic gap cavities are used to enhance emission from spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The cavities are silver nanocubes&#160;positioned on top of a gold mirror, encapsulating multilayer hBN with embedded boron vacancy spin defects. Nearly an order of magnitude enhancement is demonstrated at room temperature, associated with an efficient optically detected magnetic resonance readout.








Abstract
Spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride, and specifically the negatively charged boron vacancy (VB&#8208;) centers, are emerging candidates for quantum sensing. However, the VB&#8208; defects suffer from low quantum efficiency and, as a result, exhibit weak photoluminescence. In this work, a scalable approach is demonstrated to dramatically enhance the VB&#8208; emission by coupling to a plasmonic gap cavity. The plasmonic cavity is composed of a flat gold surface and a silver cube, with few&#8208;layer hBN flakes positioned in between. Employing these plasmonic cavities, two orders of magnitude are extracted in photoluminescence enhancement associated with a corresponding twofold enhancement in optically detected magnetic resonance contrast. The work will be pivotal to progress in quantum sensing employing 2D materials, and in realization of nanophotonic devices with spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride.

         <title>A Sodium&#8211;Antimony&#8211;Telluride Intermetallic Allows Sodium&#8208;Metal Cycling at 100% Depth of Discharge and as an Anode&#8208;Free Metal Battery</title>

         <dc:description>
A repeated rolling&#8211;folding method is employed to fabricate a unique metallurgical composite of sodium&#8211;antimony&#8211;telluride&#160;intermetallic crystallites that are&#160;densely dispersed in Na metal, which&#160;allows for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrochemical performance and achieves 100% depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge. An in&#8208;depth mechanistic study regarding the interdependence of cluster and atom adsorption energies, metal film wetting behavior and dendrites, solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase growth, and the resultant electrochemical stability is demonstrated.








Abstract
Repeated cold rolling and folding is employed to fabricate a metallurgical composite of sodium&#8211;antimony&#8211;telluride Na2(Sb2/6Te3/6Vac1/6) dispersed in electrochemically active sodium metal, termed &#8220;NST&#8208;Na.&#8221; This new intermetallic has a vacancy&#8208;rich thermodynamically stable face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic structure and enables state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrochemical performance in widely employed carbonate and ether electrolytes. NST&#8208;Na achieves 100% depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge (DOD) in 1 m NaPF6 in G2, with 15 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.4%, for 1000 h&#160;of plating/stripping. Sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs) with NST&#8208;Na and Na3V2(PO4)3&#160;(NVP) or sulfur cathodes give significantly improved energy, cycling, and CE (&gt;99%). An anode&#8208;free battery with NST collector and NVP obtains 0.23% capacity decay per cycle. Imaging and tomography using conventional and cryogenic microscopy (Cryo&#8208;EM) indicate that the sodium metal fills the open space inside the self&#8208;supporting sodiophilic NST skeleton, resulting in dense (pore&#8208;free and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI)&#8208;free) metal deposits with flat surfaces. The baseline Na deposit consists of filament&#8208;like dendrites and &#8220;dead metal&#8221;, intermixed with pores and SEI. Density functional theory calculations show that the uniqueness of NST lies in the thermodynamic stability of the Na atoms (rather than clusters) on its surface that leads to planar wetting, and in its own stability that prevents decomposition during cycling.

         <title>Self&#8208;Catalytic Small Interfering RNA Nanocarriers for Synergistic Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;catalytic siRNA nanocarriers S/Ce&#8208;PABMS with a ceria (CeO2) nanozymes&#8208;mediated rough surface can catalyze the delivery process and amplify the cellular uptake efficiency. The CeO2 nanozymes catalyze excess reactive oxygen species scavenging and cooperate with siSNCA to reduce the formation of &#945;&#8208;syn aggregates in the treatment process. S/Ce&#8208;PABMS exhibit superior synergistic treatment effects and significantly improve dyskinesia of Parkinson's disease mice.








Abstract
Gene therapy has shown great potential for neurodegenerative diseases with complex pathology. However, its therapeutic effect is limited due to the delivery barriers and its own single function. Herein, self&#8208;catalytic small interfering RNA (siRNA) nanocarriers (S/Ce&#8208;PABMS) are developed to catalyze delivery process and treatment process for synergistic treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. On the one hand, the rough surface of the S/Ce&#8208;PABMS mediated by ceria (CeO2) nanozymes can catalyze cellular uptake in the delivery process, so that S/Ce&#8208;PABMS with acetylcholine analogs penetrate the blood&#8211;brain barrier and enter neurons more effectively. On the other hand, the CeO2 nanozymes can catalyze the treatment process by scavenging excess reactive oxygen species, and cooperate with siRNA&#8208;targeting SNCA to decrease the &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;syn) aggregation and alleviate the Parkinsonian pathology. Moreover, the S/Ce&#8208;PABMS treatment reduces the number of activated microglia and regulates the release of inflammatory cytokine, thereby relieving neuroinflammation. After treatment with S/Ce&#8208;PABMS, dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease model mice is significantly alleviated. The finding shows that the self&#8208;catalytic nanocarriers, S/Ce&#8208;PABMS, have great potential in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Enabled Phase Transition of Periodic Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strain&#8208;enabled phase transition of stretchable periodic metasurfaces between any two Bravais lattices, which reflect their symmetry, is demonstrated analytically and experimentally. Such transition offers a flexible way to engineer the resonance regime and dispersion relation of metasurfaces. In particular, the strain&#8208;induced symmetry lowering leads to linearly and circularly polarized dichroism, which is demonstrated for information decoding.








Abstract
Phase transitions are universal in solid&#8208;state matters, as well as in periodic electromagnetic metasurfaces&#8212;the photonic analogues of crystals. Although such transitions dictate the properties of active metasurfaces, universal ways to describe the structure transition of periodic metasurfaces have not yet been established. Here, the authors report the strain&#8208;enabled phase transition (or lattice deformation) of stretchable metasurfaces with the crystallographic description. They analytically and experimentally demonstrate the phase transition of plasmonic lattices between two arbitrary 2D Bravais lattices under certain strain configurations. The strain&#8208;induced symmetry lowering of the structures gives rise to optical anisotropy upon polarization, namely, linearly and circularly polarized dichroism. They further demonstrate the potential of phase transition in information decoding with applied strain. Interpreting the phase transition of metasurfaces from a standpoint of symmetry would accelerate the discovery of emergent properties, and provide a generalizable approach to designing active metasurfaces.

         <title>Strongly Anisotropic Strain&#8208;Tunability of Excitons in Exfoliated ZrSe3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zirconium triselenide is a 2D semiconductor material with an interesting in&#8208;plane anisotropic crystal structure. Here, it is demonstrated that the excitons of this material are very sensitive to uniaxial strains and, interestingly, their tunability strongly depends on the direction along which the uniaxial strain is applied.








Abstract
The effect of uniaxial strain on the band structure of ZrSe3, a semiconducting material with a marked in&#8208;plane structural anisotropy, is studied. By using a modified three&#8208;point bending test apparatus, thin ZrSe3 flakes are subjected to uniaxial strain along different crystalline orientations monitoring the effect of strain on their optical properties through micro&#8208;reflectance spectroscopy. The obtained spectra show excitonic features that blueshift upon uniaxial tension. This shift is strongly dependent on the direction along which the strain is being applied. When the flakes are strained along the b&#8208;axis, the exciton peak shifts at &#8776;60&#8211;95 meV %&#8722;1, while along the a&#8208;axis, the shift only reaches &#8776;0&#8211;15 meV %&#8722;1. Ab initio calculations are conducted to study the influence of uniaxial strain, applied along different crystal directions, on the band structure and reflectance spectra of ZrSe3, exhibiting a remarkable agreement with the experimental results.

         <title>Fabrication of Circularly Polarized MR&#8208;TADF Emitters with Asymmetrical Peripheral&#8208;Lock Enhancing Helical B/N&#8208;Doped Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;TADF) and multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) properties are integrated into a new advanced material, a CPMR&#8208;TADF material. OLEDs based on these CPMR&#8208;TADF emitters show excellent performance, attaining a three&#8208;in&#8208;one advantage: high efficiency, color purity, and circular polarized light simultaneously.








Abstract
Circularly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;TADF) and multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF), which exhibit novel circularly polarized luminescence and excellent color fidelity, respectively, have gained immense popularity. In this study, integrated CP&#8208;TADF and MR&#8208;TADF (CPMR&#8208;TADF) are prepared by strategic design and synthesis of asymmetrical peripherally locked enantiomers, which are separated and denoted as (P,P&#8243;,P&#8243;)&#8208;/(M,M&#8243;,M&#8243;)&#8208;BN4 and (P,P&#8243;,P&#8243;)&#8208;/(M,M&#8243;,M&#8243;)&#8208;BN5 and exhibit TADF and circularly polarized light (CPL) properties. As the entire molecular frame participates in the frontier molecular orbitals, the resulting helical chirality of (+)/(&#8722;)&#8208;BN4&#8208; and (+)/(&#8722;)&#8208;BN5&#8208;based solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) helps in achieving a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 49/49 and 48/48&#160;nm and a high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 20.6%/19.0% and 22.0%/26.5%, respectively. Importantly, unambiguous circularly polarized electroluminescence signals with dissymmetry factors (gEL) of +3.7 &#215; 10&#8722;3/&#8722;3.1 &#215; 10&#8722;3 (BN4) and +1.9 &#215; 10&#8722;3/&#8722;1.6 &#215; 10&#8722;3 (BN5) are obtained. The results indicate successful exploitation of CPMR&#8208;TADF&#8208;emitter&#8208;based OLEDs to exhibit three characteristics: high efficiency, color purity, and circularly polarized light.

         <title>Silk Microneedle Patch Capable of On&#8208;Demand Multidrug Delivery to the Brain for Glioblastoma Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silk microneedle (SMN) patch allows the integration of multiple therapeutic drugs with controlled release profiles to stop bleeding, inhibit angiogenesis, and promote apoptosis of glioblastoma cells. Drug release kinetics are well&#8208;defined by tuning the crosslinking degree of silk and applying a trigger of transcranial near&#8208;infrared light. SMN effectively suppresses tumor volume and improves the survival rate of mice in vivo.








Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor. Surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy remains the standard treatment strategy for GBM patients. However, challenges still exist when surgery is difficult or impossible to remove the tumor completely. Herein, the design, fabrication and application of a heterogenous silk fibroin microneedle (SMN) patch is reported for circumventing the blood&#8208;brain barrier and releasing multiple drugs directly to the tumor site for drug combination treatment. The biocompatible and biodegradable SMN patch can dissolve slowly over time, allowing the sustained release of multiple drugs at different doses. Furthermore, it can be triggered remotely to induce rapid drug delivery at a designated stage after implantation. In the GBM mouse models, two clinically relevant chemotherapeutic agents (thrombin and temozolomide) and targeted drug (bevacizumab) are loaded into the SMN patch with individually controlled release profiles. The drugs are spatiotemporally and sequentially delivered for hemostasis, anti&#8208;angiogenesis, and apoptosis of tumor cells. Device application is non&#8208;toxic and results in decreased tumor volume and increased survival rate in mice. The SMN patch with on&#8208;demand multidrug delivery has potential applications for the combined administration of therapeutic drugs for the clinical treatment of brain tumors when other methods are insufficient.

         <title>Digital Light Processing Based Bioprinting with Composable Gradients</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Digital Light Processing based (bio)printing system is developed, integrating a microfluidic mixer for the generation of composable gradients of desired (bio)inks on the fly. Various planar and volumetric structures exhibiting continual gradients of materials, cell densities, growth factor concentrations, hydrogel stiffness, and porosities in horizontal and/or vertical direction, are exemplified, suggesting the promising potential of the technology toward biomedical applications.








Abstract
Recapitulation of complex tissues signifies a remarkable challenge and, to date, only a few approaches have emerged that can efficiently reconstruct necessary gradients in 3D constructs. This is true even though mimicry of these gradients is of great importance to establish the functionality of engineered tissues and devices. Here, a composable&#8208;gradient Digital Light Processing (DLP)&#8208;based (bio)printing system is developed, utilizing the unprecedented integration of a microfluidic mixer for the generation of either continual or discrete gradients of desired (bio)inks in real time. Notably, the precisely controlled gradients are composable on&#8208;the&#8208;fly by facilely by adjusting the (bio)ink flow ratios. In addition, this setup is designed in such a way that (bio)ink waste is minimized when exchanging the gradient (bio)inks, further enhancing this time&#8208; and (bio)ink&#8208;saving strategy. Various planar and 3D structures exhibiting continual gradients of materials, of cell densities, of growth factor concentrations, of hydrogel stiffness, and of porosities in horizontal and/or vertical direction, are exemplified.

&lt;p&gt;A Digital Light Processing based (bio)printing system is developed, integrating a microfluidic mixer for the generation of composable gradients of desired (bio)inks on the fly. Various planar and volumetric structures exhibiting continual gradients of materials, cell densities, growth factor concentrations, hydrogel stiffness, and porosities in horizontal and/or vertical direction, are exemplified, suggesting the promising potential of the technology toward biomedical applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recapitulation of complex tissues signifies a remarkable challenge and, to date, only a few approaches have emerged that can efficiently reconstruct necessary gradients in 3D constructs. This is true even though mimicry of these gradients is of great importance to establish the functionality of engineered tissues and devices. Here, a composable-gradient Digital Light Processing (DLP)-based (bio)printing system is developed, utilizing the unprecedented integration of a microfluidic mixer for the generation of either continual or discrete gradients of desired (bio)inks in real time. Notably, the precisely controlled gradients are composable on-the-fly by facilely by adjusting the (bio)ink flow ratios. In addition, this setup is designed in such a way that (bio)ink waste is minimized when exchanging the gradient (bio)inks, further enhancing this time- and (bio)ink-saving strategy. Various planar and 3D structures exhibiting continual gradients of materials, of cell densities, of growth factor concentrations, of hydrogel stiffness, and of porosities in horizontal and/or vertical direction, are exemplified. The composable fabrication of multifunctional gradients strongly supports the potential of the unique bioprinting system in numerous biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exploring the Pb1&#8722;xSrxHfO3 System and Potential for High Capacitive Energy Storage Density and Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural and electrical properties of antiferroelectric PbHfO3 and &#8220;potentially&#8221; ferroelectric SrHfO3 are explored. Further, the energy&#8208;storage properties of the solid solution Pb1&#8722;xSrxHfO3 (0 &#8804; x&#160;&lt;&#160;1) films are probed. An optimum strontium content is identified that leads to increased electric&#8208;breakdown strength and decreased hysteresis&#8208;loss in PbHfO3 resulting in concurrent enhancement of the capacitive energy storage density and efficiency.








Abstract
The hafnate perovskites PbHfO3 (antiferroelectric) and SrHfO3 (&#8220;potential&#8221; ferroelectric) are studied as epitaxial thin films on SrTiO3 (001) substrates with the added opportunity of observing a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) in the Pb1&#8722;xSrxHfO3 system. The resulting (240)&#8208;oriented PbHfO3 (Pba2) films exhibited antiferroelectric switching with a saturation polarization &#8776;53 &#181;C cm&#8722;2 at 1.6 MV cm&#8722;1, weak&#8208;field dielectric constant &#8776;186 at 298 K, and an antiferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;paraelectric phase transition at &#8776;518 K. (002)&#8208;oriented SrHfO3 films exhibited neither ferroelectric behavior nor evidence of a polar P4mm phase . Instead, the SrHfO3 films exhibited a weak&#8208;field dielectric constant &#8776;25 at 298 K and no signs of a structural transition to a polar phase as a function of temperature (77&#8211;623 K) and electric field (&#8211;3 to 3 MV cm&#8722;1). While the lack of ferroelectric order in SrHfO3 removes the potential for MPB, structural and property evolution of the Pb1&#8722;xSrxHfO3 (0 &#8804; x&#160;&lt;&#160;1) system is explored. Strontium alloying increased the electric&#8208;breakdown strength (EB) and decreased hysteresis loss, thus enhancing the capacitive energy storage density (Ur) and efficiency (&#951;). The composition, Pb0.5Sr0.5HfO3 produced the best combination of EB&#160;= 5.12&#160;&#177; 0.5 MV cm&#8722;1, Ur&#160;= 77&#160;&#177; 5 J cm&#8722;3, and &#951;&#160;= 97&#160;&#177; 2%, well out&#8208;performing PbHfO3 and other antiferroelectric oxides.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional sensor with high performance is fabricated from the hydrogen bond cross&#8208;linked network based on carboxylic styrene butadiene rubber (XSBR) and sericin&#8208;modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The sensor is a good fit for the basic requirements of full&#8208;human motion detection and real&#8208;time temperature variation monitoring, providing a promising route to develop wearable artificial intelligence in human activity and health.








Abstract
Recently, flexible wearable electronic devices have attracted immense interest as an alternative for conventional rigid metallic conductors in personal healthcare monitoring, human motion detection, and sensory skins, owing to their intrinsic characteristics. However, the practical applications of most wearable sensors are generally limited by their poor stretchability and sensitivity, unsatisfactory strength, lower conductivity, and single sensory function. Here a hydrogen bond cross&#8208;linked network based on carboxylic styrene butadiene rubber (XSBR) and hydrophilic sericin (SS) non&#8208;covalently modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is rationally designed and then fabricated into multi&#8208;functional sensors. The resultant versatile sensors are able to detect both weak and large deformations, which owns a low detection limit of 1% strain, high stretchability up to 217%, superior strength of 12.58 MPa, high sensitivity with a gauge factor up to 25.98, high conductivity of 0.071 S m&#8722;1, and lower percolation threshold of 0.504 wt%. Moreover, the prepared sensors also possess an impressively thermal response (0.01636 &#176;C&#8722;1) and realize the application in the measurement of human body temperature. The multifunctional and scalable XSBR/SSCNT sensor with the integrated tracking capabilities of real&#8208;time and in situ physiological signals, providing a promising route to develop wearable artificial intelligence in human health and sporting applications.

         <title>Transfer&#8208;Enabled Fabrication of Graphene Wrinkle Arrays for Epitaxial Growth of AlN Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the assistance of the transfer medium that has poor wettability on the corrugated surface of graphene, the graphene wrinkle arrays are successfully fabricated without altering the crystalline orientation of entire graphene films, which is promising for numerous applications. This work opens up a new way for periodically modifying the surface properties of graphene for epitaxial growth of AlN films.








Abstract
Formation of graphene wrinkle arrays can periodically alter the electrical properties and chemical reactivity of graphene, which is promising for numerous applications. However, large&#8208;area fabrication of graphene wrinkle arrays remains unachievable with a high density and defined orientations, especially on rigid substrates. Herein, relying on the understanding of the formation mechanism of transfer&#8208;related graphene wrinkles, the graphene wrinkle arrays are fabricated without altering the crystalline orientation of entire graphene films. The choice of the transfer medium that has poor wettability on the corrugated surface of graphene is proven to be the key for the formation of wrinkles. This work provides a deep understanding of formation process of transfer&#8208;related graphene wrinkles and opens up a new way for periodically modifying the surface properties of graphene for potential applications, including direct growth of AlN epilayers and deep ultraviolet light emitting diodes.

         <title>Synthesis of Pd3Sn and PdCuSn Nanorods with L12 Phase for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Ethanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
L12 PdCuSn, L12 Pd3Sn, and fcc Pd3Sn nanorods are controlled synthesized using a facile, one&#8208;pot, wet&#8208;chemical method. The as&#8208;synthesized ternary L12 PdCuSn nanorods exhibit a remarkable electrocatalytic activity toward the ethanol oxidation reaction in alkaline media with better performance compared to the L12 Pd3Sn nanorods, fcc Pd3Sn nanorods, and the commercial Pd/C catalyst.








Abstract
The crystal phase of nanomaterials is one of the key parameters determining their physicochemical properties and performance in various applications. However, it still remains a great challenge to synthesize nanomaterials with different crystal phases while maintaining the same composition, size, and morphology. Here, a facile, one&#8208;pot, wet&#8208;chemical method is reported to synthesize Pd3Sn nanorods with comparable size and morphology but different crystal phases, that is, an ordered intermetallic and a disordered alloy with L12 and face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) phases, respectively. The crystal phase of the as&#8208;synthesized Pd3Sn nanorods is easily tuned by altering the types of tin precursors and solvents. Moreover, the approach can also be used to synthesize ternary PdCuSn nanorods with the L12 crystal phase. When used as electrocatalysts, the L12 Pd3Sn nanorods exhibit superior electrocatalytic performance toward the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) compared to their fcc counterpart. Impressively, compared to the L12 Pd3Sn nanorods, the ternary L12 PdCuSn nanorods exhibit more enhanced electrocatalytic performance toward the EOR, yielding a high mass current density up to 6.22 A mgPd&#8722;1, which is superior to the commercial Pd/C catalyst and among the best reported Pd&#8208;based EOR electrocatalysts.

&lt;p&gt;The crystal phase of nanomaterials is one of the key parameters determining their physicochemical properties and performance in various applications.

Moreover, the approach can also be used to synthesize ternary PdCuSn nanorods with the &lt;i&gt;L1&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Ratiometric FRET Encoded Hierarchical ZrMOF&#8202;@&#8202;Au Cluster for Ultrasensitive Quantifying MicroRNA In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The developed probes enable the ultrasensitive quantifying microRNA with zeptomolar level and the distinct imaging&#8208;based monitoring of cancer marker miR&#8208;21 both in living cells and in vivo, which offers new avenues for simultaneous diagnoses and treatments of early&#8208;stage cancers.








Abstract
Here, Zirconium metal&#8722;organic frameworks&#8202;@&#8202;gold (ZrMOF&#8202;@&#8202;Au) cluster architectures have been fabricated and then functionalized with two fluorescent dyes (Quasar [QS] and Cyanine5.5 [Cy5.5]) through deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization, to form a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) encoded ZrMOF&#8202;&#8202;@&#8202;&#8202;Au&#8208;QS/Cy5.5 complex. In the presence of the target intracellular microRNA (miR)&#8208;21, the fluorescence of Cy5.5 at 705&#160;nm (F705) decreases and the fluorescence of QS at 665&#160;nm (F665) increases when Cy5.5 is released from the surface of ZrMOF&#8202;&#8202;@&#8202;&#8202;Au&#8208;QS/Cy5.5. The change in the fluorescence ratio (F705/F665) shows an outstanding linear range of 0.006&#8211;67.9 amol/ngRNA, and the limit of detection is 4.51 zmol/ngRNA in living cells. The high ratio loading of nucleic acid on surface of ZrMOF&#8202;@&#8202;Au cluster and two fluorescence encoded signal enables better sensitivity and reliability. Zeptomolar sensitivity and good linearity against target affords distinct imaging&#8208;based monitoring of the cancer marker miR&#8208;21 both in living cells and in vivo. At the same time, the architecture displays remarkable photothermal conversion efficiency (53.7%) and gives rise to outstanding therapy ability in vivo. This strategy offers new avenues for the intelligent quantification of miRNAs for simultaneous diagnoses and treatments of early&#8208;stage cancers.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Metal&#8208;Enabled Mechanical&#8208;Energy&#8208;Induced CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
With mechanical energy as the stimulus, CO2 is converted into solid carbon and O2 in a liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;based reaction system. Using the synergism of Ga nanodroplets and Ag&#8211;Ga nanorods, CO2 conversion proceeds through the triboelectrochemical reaction on Ga, while the Ag&#8211;Ga rods ensure the system's sustainability. This is achieved at a remarkably low energy consumption and high efficiency.








Abstract
A green carbon capture and conversion technology offering scalability and economic viability for mitigating CO2 emissions is reported. The technology uses suspensions of gallium liquid metal to reduce CO2 into carbonaceous solid products and O2 at near room temperature. The nonpolar nature of the liquid gallium interface allows the solid products to instantaneously exfoliate, hence keeping active sites accessible. The solid co&#8208;contributor of silver&#8211;gallium rods ensures a cyclic sustainable process. The overall process relies on mechanical energy as the input, which drives nano&#8208;dimensional triboelectrochemical reactions. When a gallium/silver fluoride mix at 7:1 mass ratio is employed to create the reaction material, 92% efficiency is obtained at a remarkably low input energy of 230 kWh (excluding the energy used for dissolving CO2) for the capture and conversion of a tonne of CO2. This green technology presents an economical solution for CO2 emissions.

Semiconducting mesocrystalline bulk polymer specimens are demonstrated exhibiting near&#8208;intrinsic properties using channel&#8208;die pressing. Predominant edge&#8208;on orientation is obtained for hole&#8208; and electron&#8208;transporting polymer semicnductors throughout 2 mm&#8208;thick/wide samples. This persistent mesocrystalline arrangement at macroscopic scales allows reliable evaluation of the electronic charge&#8208;transport anisotropy predicted along all three crystallographic axes, without the need to grow single crystals.








Abstract
Semiconducting mesocrystalline bulk polymer specimens that exhibit near&#8208;intrinsic properties using channel&#8208;die pressing are demonstrated. A predominant edge&#8208;on orientation is obtained for poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diyl) (P3HT) throughout 2 mm&#8208;thick/wide samples. This persistent mesocrystalline arrangement at macroscopic scales allows reliable evaluation of the electronic charge&#8208;transport anisotropy along all three crystallographic axes, with high mobilities found along the &#960;&#8208;stacking. Indeed, charge&#8208;carrier mobilities of up to 2.3 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 are measured along the &#960;&#8208;stack, which are some of the highest mobilities reported for polymers at low charge&#8208;carrier densities (drop&#8208;cast films display mobilities of maximum &#8776;10&#8722;3 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1). The structural coherence also leads to an unusually well&#8208;defined photoluminescence line&#8208;shape characteristic of an H&#8208;aggregate (measured from the surface perpendicular to the materials flow), rather than the typical HJ&#8208;aggregate feature usually found for P3HT. The approach is widely applicable: to electrical conductors and materials used in n&#8208;type devices, such as poly{[N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;octyldodecyl)&#8208;naphthalene&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;bis(dicarboximide)&#8208;2,6&#8208;diyl]&#8208;alt&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophene)} (N2200) where the mesocrystalline structure leads to high electron transport along the polymer backbones (&#8776;1.3 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1). This versatility and the broad applicability of channel&#8208;die pressing signifies its promise as a straightforward, readily scalable method to fabricate bulk semiconducting polymer structures at macroscopic scales with properties typically accessible only by the tedious growth of single crystals.

         <title>Over 21% Efficiency Stable 2D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pure formamidinum (FA)&#8208;based 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs) achieve a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.07% (certified over 20%), the highest efficiency for low&#8208;dimensional PSCs (n&#160;&#8804; 10) reported to date, together with the improved device stability. The high&#8208;efficiency device exhibits a narrowed bandgap and unique 2D&#8211;3D intermixing phase distribution for improved light absorption and superior charge transport.








Abstract
Owing to their insufficient light absorption and charge transport, 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskites show relatively low efficiency. In this work, methylammonium (MA), formamidinum (FA), and FA/MA mixed 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are fabricated. Incorporating FA cations extends the absorption range and enhances the light absorption. Optical spectroscopy shows that FA cations substantially increase the portion of 3D&#8208;like phase to 2D phases, and X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) studies reveal that FA&#8208;based 2D perovskite possesses an oblique crystal orientation. Nevertheless, the ultrafast interphase charge transfer results in an extremely long carrier&#8208;diffusion length (&#8776;1.98&#160;&#181;m). Also, chloride additives effectively suppress the yellow &#948;&#8208;phase formation of pure FA&#8208;based 2D PSCs. As a result, both FA/MA mixed and pure FA&#8208;based 2D PSCs exhibit a greatly enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 20%. Specifically, the pure FA&#8208;based 2D PSCs achieve a record PCE of 21.07% (certified at 20%), which is the highest efficiency for low&#8208;dimensional PSCs (n&#160;&#8804; 10) reported to date. Importantly, the FA&#8208;based 2D PSCs retain 97% of their initial efficiency at 85&#160;&#176;C persistent heating after 1500&#160;h. The results unambiguously demonstrate that pure&#8208;FA&#8208;based 2D PSCs are promising for achieving comparable efficiency to 3D perovskites, along with a better device stability.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Harsh&#8208;Environment&#8208;Resistant GaOX Solar&#8208;Blind Photodetectors via Defect and Doping Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Certain application situations of solar&#8208;blind photodetectors (SBPDs) inevitably face harsh conditions (e.g., high temperature/electronic&#8208;field/radiation). Gallium oxide with an ultrawide bandgap is regarded as one of the most promising materials for SBPDs. Defect and doping engineering, including Ga&#8208;rich design and doping compensation, has been demonstrated as an effective strategy for low&#8208;cost amorphous GaOX to force a way towards harsh&#8208;condition&#8208;resistant SBPDs.








Abstract
Gallium oxide (Ga2O3), with an ultrawide bandgap, is currently regarded as one of the most promising materials for solar&#8208;blind photodetectors (SBPDs), which are greatly demanded in harsh environment, such as space exploration and flame prewarning. However, realization of high&#8208;performance SBPDs with high tolerance toward harsh environments based on low&#8208;cost Ga2O3 material faces great challenges. Here, defect and doping (DD) engineering towards amorphous GaOX (a&#8208;GaOX) has been proposed to obtain ultrasensitive SBPDs for harsh condition application. Serious oxygen deficiency and doping compensation of the engineered a&#8208;GaOX film ensure the high response currents and low dark currents, respectively. Annealing item in nitrogen of DD engineering also incurs the recrystallization of material, formation of nanopores by oxygen escape, and suppression of sub&#8208;bandgap defect states. As a result, the tailored GaOX SBPD based on DD engineering not only harvests a record&#8208;high responsivity rejection ratio (R254 nm/R365 nm) of 1.8&#160;&#215;&#160;107, 102 times higher detectivity, and 2&#160;&#215;&#160;102 times faster decay speed than the control device, but also keeps a high responsivity, high photo&#8208;to&#8208;dark current ratio, and sharp imaging capability even at high temperature (280&#160;&#176;C) or high bias (100&#160;V). The proposed DD engineering provides an effective strategy towards highly harsh&#8208;environment&#8208;resistant GaOX SBPDs.

         <title>Investigation of the Effect of 3D Meniscus Geometry on Fluid Dynamics and Crystallization via In Situ Optical Microscopy&#8208;Assisted Mathematical Modeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D geometrical model of the meniscus is attained using high&#8208;speed side&#8208;view and top&#8208;view in situ microscopy, within which a mathematical model for momentum and mass transport is developed. Utilizing 3D meniscus geometry, the underlying mechanism of dendritic growth of small molecule organic semiconductors is elucidated, which is widely applicable to various materials and coating systems.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;based thin&#8208;film solidification is a complex process involving various transport phenomena that are intricately dependent on multiple experimental parameters. The difficulty of analyzing this process experimentally or conducting exact numerical simulation make it challenging to understand, predict, and control the solidification process. In this work, a simple and effective technique to analyze the thin&#8208;film solidification process during solution shearing, based on 3D geometrical model of the meniscus, is proposed. The 3D meniscus geometry, which changes depending on the experimental parameters, is attained using high&#8208;speed side&#8208;view and top&#8208;view in situ microscopy. Thereafter, mass and momentum transport mathematical models are applied to obtain numerical solutions of transport phenomena within the meniscus. Utilizing these results, the underlying mechanism of dendritic growth of small molecule organic semiconductor is elucidated, which has previously been unknown. The 3D meniscus modeling is particularly important for this analysis, as dendrite formation is strongly dependent on the meniscus geometry near the contact line and mass transport variation perpendicular to the coating direction. This technique enables the study of complex relationship between experimental parameters and solidification process, which is widely applicable to various materials and coating systems; whereby, better understanding of thin&#8208;film growth and device performance optimization is possible.

Bioprinting
In article number 2107038, Yu Shrike Zhang and co&#8208;workers develop a (bio)printing system based on Digital Light Processing to utilize the integration of a microfluidic mixer for the generation of either continual or discrete gradients of desired (bio)inks in real time. As such, the precisely controlled gradients are composable on&#8208;the&#8208;fly by facilely adjusting the (bio)ink flow ratios, supporting the potential of the platform in numerous biomedical applications.

Artificial Biomolecular Condensates
In article number 2104704, Huaimin Wang and co&#8208;workers report a general approach for constructing artificial biomolecular condensates of oligopeptide in living cells. The rationally designed aromatic&#8208;capped peptides can reversibly form a nanofibrous hydrogel with a change of the conformation and morphologies in the lysosome. The formed condensates undergo swelling in the lysosome, leading to lysosomal membrane permeabilization and re&#8208;direction of therapeutic drugs to the target.

Tadf Emitters
Circularly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;TADF) and multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) properties are integrated into new CPMR&#8208;TADF materials by Xiugang Wu, You&#8208;Xuan Zheng, Weiguo Zhu, Pi&#8208;Tai Chou, and co&#8208;workers, as described in article number 2105080. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on these CPMR&#8208;TADF emitters attain a three&#8208;in&#8208;one advantage simultaneously: high efficiency, color purity, and circular polarized light.

Anode&#8208;Free Batteries
In article number 2106005, Hui Dong, David Mitlin, and co&#8208;workers report an intermetallic for anode&#8208;free batteries. The winter scene shows a birthday cake with lit candles that are melting: the cake represents the complex structure of a cycled sodium&#8208;metal anode with the protruding candles being the dendrites. A slice, obtained by cryogenic focused ion beam (FIB) microscopy, further reveals the underlying porosity that develops during repeated plating and stripping of the metal. The thick non&#8208;uniform red frosting on the cake represents the unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) that drives the dendrite growth.

Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes
Triplet exciton harvesting via triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation, is known to generate only 40% of the total radiative excitons in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) theoretically. In article number 2100161, Yun&#8208;Hi Kim, Jang&#8208;Joo Kim, and co&#8208;workers realize a total radiative exciton ratio of nearly 50% with a carefully designed anthracene derivative and device structure, breaking the theoretical efficiency limit of OLEDs based on anthracene derivatives.

Electro&#8208;Actuation
In article number 2105923, Manuel Brinker and Patrick Huber report laser cantilever bending experiments that show large and reversible electrosorption&#8208;induced deformation of wafer&#8208;scale nanoporous silicon in aqueous electrolytes (isotonic saline solution) at exceptionally small operation voltages. This paves the way for on&#8208;chip integrated actuation and stress generation, e.g.,  in (bio&#8208;)medical environments, as is illustrated by electro&#8208;mechanical stimulation of living cells.

Tumor Therapy
In article number 2106606, Nan Qin, Tiger H. Tao, and co&#8208;workers report a heterogenous silk microneedle patch to spatiotemporally and sequentially deliver multiple therapeutic drugs for hemostasis, anti&#8208;angiogenesis, and apoptosis of brain tumor cells. Drug release kinetics are well&#8208;defined by tuning the crosslinking degree of the silk and applying a trigger of transcranial NIR&#8208;light irradiation. This biodegradable patch has potential applications for the clinical treatment of intracranial tumors.

Deep&#8208;UV Photodetectors
High&#8208;performance harsh&#8208;environment&#8208;resistant deep&#8208;UV (DUV) photodetectors have important applications in space exploration and flame prewarning. In article number 2106923, Xiaolong Zhao, Shibing Long, and co&#8208;workers tailor defect/doping engineering based on the low&#8208;cost GaOX to obtain high&#8208;performance DUV detectors. The defect/doping engineering induces recrystallization, doping compensation, and nanopore formation inside the material, giving it great potential for DUV detection in harsh conditions.

         <title>Processing of Self&#8208;Healing Polymers for Soft Robotics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft robots are inherently safe, but prone to various damage types. Self&#8208;healing polymers address this vulnerability. In this work, the variety of processing techniques of self&#8208;healing polymers for robotics in the literature is reviewed and limitations and opportunities are discussed. Two promising research fields are bridged, and a guide is given toward selecting suitable processing methods based on a self&#8208;healing polymer and the intended soft robotics application.








Abstract
Soft robots are, due to their softness, inherently safe and adapt well to unstructured environments. However, they are prone to various damage types. Self&#8208;healing polymers address this vulnerability. Self&#8208;healing soft robots can recover completely from macroscopic damage, extending their lifetime. For developing healable soft robots, various formative and additive manufacturing methods have been exploited to shape self&#8208;healing polymers into complex structures. Additionally, several novel manufacturing techniques, noted as (re)assembly binding techniques that are specific to self&#8208;healing polymers, have been created. Herein, the wide variety of processing techniques of self&#8208;healing polymers for robotics available in the literature is reviewed, and limitations and opportunities discussed thoroughly. Based on defined requirements for soft robots, these techniques are critically compared and validated. A strong focus is drawn to the reversible covalent and (physico)chemical cross&#8208;links present in the self&#8208;healing polymers that do not only endow healability to the resulting soft robotic components, but are also beneficial in many manufacturing techniques. They solve current obstacles in soft robots, including the formation of robust multi&#8208;material parts, recyclability, and stress relaxation. This review bridges two promising research fields, and guides the reader toward selecting a suitable processing method based on a self&#8208;healing polymer and the intended soft robotics&#160;application.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Driven Biomaterials Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advancement of machine learning (ML) in materials science has progressed in leaps and bounds and has made a big impact into biomaterials research, ranging from discovery of bioactive chemical moieties, screening and optimization of material properties, to developing materials that interface better with biological systems. There is still untapped potential to integrate with ML for the next frontier in biomaterials.








Abstract
Biomaterials is an exciting and dynamic field, which uses a collection of diverse materials to achieve desired biological responses. While there is constant evolution and innovation in materials with time, biomaterials research has been hampered by the relatively long development period required. In recent years, driven by the need to accelerate materials development, the applications of machine learning in materials science has progressed in leaps and bounds. The combination of machine learning with high&#8208;throughput theoretical predictions and high&#8208;throughput experiments (HTE) has shifted the traditional Edisonian (trial and error) paradigm to a data&#8208;driven paradigm. In this review, each type of biomaterial and their key properties and use cases are systematically discussed, followed by how machine learning can be applied in the development and design process. The discussions are classified according to various types of materials used including polymers, metals, ceramics, and nanomaterials, and implants using additive manufacturing. Last, the current gaps and potential of machine learning to further aid biomaterials discovery and application are also discussed.

         <title>Bimetallic Janus Nanocrystals: Syntheses and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic Janus nanocrystals feature a side&#8208;by&#8208;side arrangement of two distinct metals divided by a heterogeneous interface. This unique structure allows one to present both metals on the same particle while tailoring the plasmonic coupling and electronic interaction between them, making the structure particularly viable for plasmonic, catalytic, and photocatalytic applications.








Abstract
Bimetallic Janus nanocrystals have received considerable interest in recent years owing to their unique properties and niche applications. The side&#8208;by&#8208;side distribution of two distinct metals provides a flexible platform for tailoring the optical and catalytic properties of nanocrystals. First, a brief introduction to the structural features of bimetallic Janus nanocrystals, followed by an extensive discussion of the synthetic approaches, is given. The strategies and experimental controls for achieving the Janus structure, as well as the mechanistic understandings, are specifically discussed. Then, a number of intriguing properties and applications enabled by the Janus nanocrystals are highlighted. Finally, this article is concluded with future directions and outlooks with respect to both syntheses and applications of this new class of functional nanomaterials.

         <title>Advanced Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care Testing Technologies for Human Acute Respiratory Virus Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advanced rapid point&#8208;of&#8208;care tests (POCTs), including nucleic acid amplification, optical POCTs, electrochemistry, lateral flow assay, microfluidics, ELISA, and microarray&#8208;based platforms, act figuratively as the Great Wall to the widespread transmission of acute respiratory virus infections by enabling early and rapid detection of these pathogens, as is the case during the current pandemic.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;growing global threats to human life caused by the human acute respiratory virus (RV) infections have cost billions of lives, created a significant economic burden, and shaped society for centuries. The timely response to emerging RVs could save human lives and reduce the medical care burden. The development of RV detection technologies is essential for potentially preventing RV pandemic and epidemics. However, commonly used detection technologies lack sensitivity, specificity, and speed, thus often failing to provide the rapid turnaround times. To address this problem, new technologies are devised to address the performance inadequacies of the traditional methods. These emerging technologies offer improvements in convenience, speed, flexibility, and portability of point&#8208;of&#8208;care test (POCT). Herein, recent developments in POCT are comprehensively reviewed for eight typical acute respiratory viruses. This review discusses the challenges and opportunities of various recognition and detection strategies and discusses these according to their detection principles, including nucleic acid amplification, optical POCT, electrochemistry, lateral flow assays, microfluidics, enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assays, and microarrays. The importance of limits of detection, throughput, portability, and specificity when testing clinical samples in resource&#8208;limited settings is emphasized. Finally, the evaluation of commercial POCT kits for both essential RV diagnosis and clinical&#8208;oriented practices is included.

         <title>Fiber&#8208;Based Biopolymer Processing as a Route toward Sustainability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plastics sustainability is a growing issue and structural biopolymers from nature (e.g., cellulose, chitin, silk) offer new, long&#8208;term solutions. Recent advances with thermoplastic processing, as well as fibrillation strategies, offer new routes to more competitive processing strategies than traditional solution approaches. Challenges remain with scaling, further insight into mechanisms, use of molecular modeling and plasticizer optimization.








Abstract
Some of the most abundant biomass on earth is sequestered in fibrous biopolymers like cellulose, chitin, and silk.&#160;These types of natural materials offer unique and striking mechanical and functional features that have driven strong interest in their utility for a range of applications, while also matching environmental sustainability needs.&#160;However, these material systems are challenging to process in cost&#8208;competitive ways to compete with synthetic plastics due to the limited options for thermal processing.&#160;This results in the dominance of solution&#8208;based processing for fibrous biopolymers, which presents challenges for scaling, cost, and consistency in outcomes. However, new opportunities to utilize thermal processing with these types of biopolymers, as well as fibrillation approaches, can drive renewed opportunities to bridge this gap between synthetic plastic processing and fibrous biopolymers, while also holding sustainability goals as critical to long&#8208;term successful outcomes.

         <title>Tin Halide Perovskites: From Fundamental Properties to Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thorough overview is given on the fundamental properties of tin halide perovskites tailored to their application in solar cells. A detailed discussion of the crystal structure, electronic properties, photophysics, and thin&#8208;film crystallization of tin halide perovskites provides a foundation to highlight its exceptional properties and reveals research strategies to improve the performance of tin halide solar cells.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites have unique optical and electrical properties, which make them an excellent class of materials for a broad spectrum of optoelectronic applications. However, it is with photovoltaic devices that this class of materials has reached the apotheosis of popularity. High power conversion efficiencies are achieved with lead&#8208;based compounds, which are toxic to the environment. Tin&#8208;based perovskites are the most promising alternative because of their bandgap close to the optimal value for photovoltaic applications, the strong optical absorption, and good charge carrier mobilities. Nevertheless, the low defect tolerance, the fast crystallization, and the oxidative instability of tin halide perovskites currently limit their efficiency. The aim of this review is to give a detailed overview of the crystallographic, photophysical, and optoelectronic properties of tin&#8208;based perovskite compounds in their multiple forms from 3D to low&#8208;dimensional structures. At the end, recent progress in tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells are reviewed, mainly focusing on the detail of the strategies adopted to improve the device performances. For each subtopic, the current challenges and the outlook are discussed, with the aim to stimulate the community to address the most important issues in a concerted manner.

         <title>Bioinspired and Biomimetic Delivery Platforms for Cancer Vaccines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>

Integration of biomimetic designs into delivery platforms for cancer vaccines can enhance efficacy while retaining good safety profiles, which contributes to expediting the clinical translation of cancer vaccines. A detailed overview of current progress, potential challenges, and future directions of bioinspired delivery platforms for cancer vaccines is provided here.








Abstract
Cancer vaccines aim at eliciting tumor&#8208;specific responses for the immune system to identify and eradicate malignant tumor cells while sparing the normal tissues. Furthermore, cancer vaccines can potentially induce long&#8208;term immunological memory for antitumor responses, preventing metastasis and cancer recurrence, thus presenting an attractive treatment option in cancer immunotherapy. However, clinical efficacy of cancer vaccines has remained low due to longstanding challenges, such as poor immunogenicity, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, tumor heterogeneity, inappropriate immune tolerance, and systemic toxicity. Recently, bioinspired materials and biomimetic technologies have emerged to play a part in reshaping the field of cancer nanomedicine. By mimicking desirable chemical and biological properties in nature, bioinspired engineering of cancer vaccine delivery platforms can effectively transport therapeutic cargos to tumor sites, amplify antigen and adjuvant bioactivities, and enable spatiotemporal control and on&#8208;demand immunoactivation. As such, integration of biomimetic designs into delivery platforms for cancer vaccines can enhance efficacy while retaining good safety profiles, which contributes to expediting the clinical translation of cancer vaccines. Recent advances in bioinspired delivery platforms for cancer vaccines, existing obstacles faced, as well as insights and future directions for the field are discussed here.

         <title>Recent Advances in Fluorinated Graphene from Synthesis to Applications: Critical Review on Functional Chemistry and Structure Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent advances in fluorinated graphene (FG) from the synthesis methods to the broad applications and the relationship between the structures and properties are reviewed in detail. Especially, rational structure engineering and the abundant functional chemistry are the significant directions which are further discussed for the future development of FG.








Abstract
Fluorinated graphene (FG), as an emerging member of the graphene derivatives family, has attracted wide attention on account of its excellent performances and underlying applications. The introduction of a fluorine atom, with the strongest electronegativity (3.98), greatly changes the electron distribution of graphene, resulting in a series of unique variations in optical, electronic, magnetic, interfacial properties and so on. Herein, recent advances in the study of FG from synthesis to applications are introduced, and the relationship between its structure and properties is summarized in detail. Especially, the functional chemistry of FG has been thoroughly analyzed in recent years, which has opened a universal route for the functionalization and even multifunctionalization of FG toward various graphene derivatives, which further broadens its applications. Moreover, from a particular angle, the structure engineering of FG such as the distribution pattern of fluorine atoms and the regulation of interlayer structure when advanced nanotechnology gets involved is summarized. Notably, the elaborated structure engineering of FG is the key factor to optimize the corresponding properties for potential applications, and is also an up&#8208;to&#8208;date research hotspot and future development direction. Finally, perspectives and prospects for the problems and challenges in the study of FG are put forward.
