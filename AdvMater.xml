      <title>Mirroring Action Potentials: Label&#8208;Free, Accurate, and Noninvasive Electrophysiological Recordings of Human&#8208;Derived Cardiomyocytes</title>
      <dc:description>
A new electrophysiology paradigm transduces cellular action potentials into optical signals by mirroring the cellular ionic currents into the motion of fluorophores in a separate fluid. The resulting optical signals (mirror action potentials) offer an accurate, noninvasive measurement of the cells&#8217; action potentials. This methodology, successfully tested on human&#8208;derived cardiomyocytes, is an ideal candidate for noninvasive optical drug screenings.








Abstract
The electrophysiological recording of action potentials in human cells is a long&#8208;sought objective due to its pivotal importance in many disciplines. Among the developed techniques, invasiveness remains a common issue, causing cytotoxicity or altering unpredictably cell physiological response. In this work, a new approach for recording intracellular signals of outstanding quality and with noninvasiveness is introduced. By taking profit of the concept of mirror charge in classical electrodynamics, the new proposed device transduces cell ionic currents into mirror charges in a microfluidic chamber, thus realizing a virtual mirror cell. By monitoring mirror charge dynamics, it is possible to effectively record the action potentials fired by the cells. Since there is no need for accessing or interacting with the cells, the method is intrinsically noninvasive. In addition, being based on optical recording, it shows high spatial resolution and high parallelization. As shown through a set of experiments, the presented methodology is an ideal candidate for the next generation devices for the reliable assessment of cardiotoxicity on human&#8208;derived cardiomyocytes. More generally, it paves the way toward a new family of in vitro biodevices that will lay a new milestone in the field of electrophysiology.

      <title>Electrolytes and Interphases in Potassium Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Electrolytes play a critical role in the electrochemical performance of emerging potassium ion batteries (PIBs). The research progress on electrolytes of PIBs is summarized in terms of fundamental properties, optimization of electrolyte components and engineering of electrode/electrolyte interfaces, providing a comprehensive guidance on designing more suitable electrolytes for high performance PIBs.








Abstract
Potassium ion batteries (PIBs) are recognized as one promising candidate for future energy storage devices due to their merits of cost&#8208;effectiveness, high&#8208;voltage, and high&#8208;power operation. Many efforts have been devoted to the development of electrode materials and the progress has been well summarized in recent review papers. However, in addition to electrode materials, electrolytes also play a key role in determining the cell performance. Here, the research progress of electrolytes in PIBs is summarized, including organic liquid electrolytes, ionic liquid electrolytes, solid&#8208;state electrolytes and aqueous electrolytes, and the engineering of the electrode/electrolyte interfaces is also thoroughly discussed. This Progress Report provides a comprehensive guidance on the design of electrolyte systems for development of high performance PIBs.

      <title>Digital Transformation in Materials Science: A Paradigm Change in Material's Development</title>
      <dc:description>
The ongoing expansion of digitalization approaches influences the material research significantly. The complete workflow of the development of novel materials, from synthesis, over characterization, to fabrication will change within the coming years to a more automatic, data&#8208;driven, and robot&#8208;based approach. The current status is summarized and advantages, challenges, and future perspectives discussed.








Abstract
The ongoing digitalization is rapidly changing and will further revolutionize all parts of life. This statement is currently omnipresent in the media as well as in the scientific community; however, the exact consequences of the proceeding digitalization for the field of materials science in general and the way research will be performed in the future are still unclear. There are first promising examples featuring the potential to change discovery and development approaches toward new materials. Nevertheless, a wide range of open questions have to be solved in order to enable the so&#8208;called digital&#8208;supported material research. The current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, the present and future challenges, as well as the resulting perspectives for materials science are described.

There are first promising examples featuring the potential to change discovery and development approaches toward new materials. Nevertheless, a wide range of open questions have to be solved in order to enable the so&#8208;called digital&#8208;supported material research. The current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, the present and future challenges, as well as the resulting perspectives for materials science are described.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nanocatalytic Theranostics with Glutathione Depletion and Enhanced Reactive Oxygen Species Generation for Efficient Cancer Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
A fully biodegradable and biocompatible nanotheranostics (denoted as PGC&#8208;DOX) is constructed by an in situ biomineralization method using poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;modified glucose oxidase (GOx) as template. The integration of GOx&#8208;mediated starvation therapy, H2O2 self&#8208;supplying and glutathione&#8208;eliminating enhanced chemodynamic therapy, and DOX&#8208;induced chemotherapy, mean that the prepared PGC&#8208;DOX is effective for tumor growth inhibition with minimal side effects in vivo.








Abstract
Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) is an emerging therapy method that kills cancer cells by converting intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into highly toxic hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH). To overcome the current limitations of the insufficient endogenous H2O2 and the high concentration of glutathione (GSH) in tumor cells, an intelligent nanocatalytic theranostics (denoted as PGC&#8208;DOX) that possesses both H2O2 self&#8208;supply and GSH&#8208;elimination properties for efficient cancer therapy is presented. This nanoplatform is constructed by a facile one&#8208;step biomineralization method using poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;modified glucose oxidase (GOx) as a template to form biodegradable copper&#8208;doped calcium phosphate nanoparticles, followed by the loading of doxorubicin (DOX). As an enzyme catalyst, GOx can effectively catalyze intracellular glucose to generate H2O2, which not only starves the tumor cells, but also supplies H2O2 for subsequent Fenton&#8208;like reaction. Meanwhile, the redox reaction between the released Cu2+ ions and intracellular GSH will induce GSH depletion and reduce Cu2+ to Fenton agent Cu+ ions, and then trigger the H2O2 to generate &#8226;OH by a Cu+&#8208;mediated Fenton&#8208;like reaction, resulting in enhanced CDT efficacy. The integration of GOx&#8208;mediated starvation therapy, H2O2 self&#8208;supply and GSH&#8208;elimination enhanced CDT, and DOX&#8208;induced chemotherapy, endow the PGC&#8208;DOX with effective tumor growth inhibition with minimal side effects in vivo.

      <title>Metasurfaces: Three&#8208;Dimensional Photoengraving of Monolithic, Multifaceted Metasurfaces (Adv. Mater. 1/2021)</title>
      <dc:description>
Metasurfaces are traditionally 2D metamaterials that manipulate light. In article number 2005454, Shu Yang and co&#8208;workers bring them into 3D by photoengraving diverse metasurfaces onto different facets of monolithic, 3D microstructured arrays in a high&#8208;throughput and on demand fashion. By patterning locally confined metasurfaces on a cube, each cube becomes a multiplexing pixel for color reflection and filtering.

      <dc:description>
The coupling of quasi&#8208;2D perovskite layers is demonstrated by Kai Wang, Rui Chen, Wallace C. H. Choy, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2005570. Their results show that a bifunctional ligand can simultaneously diminish the weak van der Waals gap and passivate perovskite defects for efficient energy transfer and radiative recombination. They fabricate blue PeLEDs that show high performance with an EQE of 10.11% and a long stability of 81.3 min.

      <title>Chiral Materials: Fullerene Desymmetrization as a Means to Achieve Single&#8208;Enantiomer Electron Acceptors with Maximized Chiroptical Responsiveness (Adv. Mater. 1/2021)</title>
      <dc:description>
Solubilized fullerene derivatives have revolutionized the development of organic photovoltaic devices, but the isomeric complexity that arises from addition of the solubilizing group is often ignored. In article number 2004115, Matthew J. Fuchter and co&#8208;workers separate 10 pairs of enantiomers from the 19 structural isomers of a common fullerene acceptor. They demonstrate the potential to discriminate circularly polarized light with a fast light&#8208;response time and with a very high photocurrent dissymmetry factor, enabled by a chiral fullerene.

     alt="Chiral Materials: Fullerene Desymmetrization as a Means to Achieve Single&#8208;Enantiomer Electron Acceptors with Maximized Chiroptical Responsiveness (Adv. Mater. 1/2021)"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solubilized fullerene derivatives have revolutionized the development of organic photovoltaic devices, but the isomeric complexity that arises from addition of the solubilizing group is often ignored. In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202004115"&gt;2004115&lt;/a&gt;, Matthew J. Fuchter and co&#8208;workers separate 10 pairs of enantiomers from the 19 structural isomers of a common fullerene acceptor. They demonstrate the potential to discriminate circularly polarized light with a fast light&#8208;response time and with a very high photocurrent dissymmetry factor, enabled by a chiral fullerene.

      <title>Thermoelectric Materials: Compositional Fluctuations Locked by Athermal Transformation Yielding High Thermoelectric Performance in GeTe (Adv. Mater. 1/2021)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2005612, Pai&#8208;Chun Wei, Hsin&#8208;Jay Wu,  and co&#8208;workers leverage the interplay between the spinodal decomposition and athermal phase transition in GeTe&#8208;based thermoelectric materials. The exquisite microstructure, featured by strong composition fluctuations and the coexistence of rhombohedral&#8208; and cubic&#8208;GeTe, yield high zT values of &gt;2.6. This work provides a new thermodynamic route to developing higher&#8208;performance thermoelectric materials in general.

Abstract
Nano polymorphism (NPM), as an emerging research area in the field of energy storage, and rechargeable batteries, have attracted much attention recently. In this review, the recent progress on the composition and formation of polymorphs, and the evolution processes of different redox electrodes in rechargeable metal&#8208;ion, metal&#8211;air, and metal&#8211;sulfur batteries are highlighted. First, NPM and its significance for rechargeable batteries are discussed. Subsequently, the current NPM modulation strategies of different types of representative electrodes for their corresponding rechargeable battery applications are summarized. The goal is to demonstrate how NPM could tune the intrinsic material properties, and hence, improve their electrochemical activities for each battery type. It is expected that the analysis of polymorphism and electrochemical properties of materials could help identify some &#8220;processing&#8211;structure&#8211;properties&#8221; relationships for material design and performance enhancement.

      <title>Self&#8208;Amplifying Nanotherapeutic Drugs Homing to Tumors in a Manner of Chain Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel tumor&#8208;targeting nanodrug with self&#8208;amplifying effects based on chain reaction mechanism is developed. The nanodrug can activate more drug&#8208;accessible targets for effectively homing itself to tumor in large amount. In addition, it can be used as a nanocarrier to selectively deliver other drugs to tumors. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated its high tumor&#8208;targeting ability and antitumor effect.








Abstract
Active tumor&#8208;targeting drug delivery has great potency in cancer therapy. However, the targeting efficiency of traditional active tumor&#8208;targeting nanotherapeutic drugs is limited by the scarcity of their accessible targets/receptors in tumors. Here, a novel self&#8208;amplifying tumor&#8208;targeting strategy with a chain reaction mechanism is developed. A coagulation targeting peptide (GNQEQVSPLTLLKXC, termed A15)&#8208;decorated poly(L&#8208;glutamic acid)&#8208;graft&#8208;maleimide poly(ethylene glycol)/combretastatin A4 conjugate (A15&#8208;PLG&#8208;CA4) is prepared to obtain a self&#8208;amplifying nanotherapeutic platform homing to tumors. After administration to tumor&#8208;bearing mice, A15&#8208;PLG&#8208;CA4 starts a chain reaction cycle consisting of intratumoral hemorrhage, target FXIIIa amplification, blood clot binding, and CA4 release in tumors. In this way, A15&#8208;PLG&#8208;CA4 increases the level of its accessible targets (FXIIIa) in a manner of chain reaction. The FXIIIa activity at 8&#160;h is 4.1&#8208;fold more than the one at 0&#160;h in the C26 tumors treated with A15&#8208;PLG&#8208;CA4. The total CA4 concentration at 24&#160;h is 2.9&#8208;fold more than the control. A15&#8208;PLG&#8208;CA4 shows a significantly higher antitumor effect against large C26 tumors (&#8776;500&#160;mm3) thanks to the remarkable tumor&#8208;targeting ability compared with the control. Therefore, this report highlights the potential of the self&#8208;amplifying tumor&#8208;targeting strategy in the development of next generation active tumor&#8208;targeting nanotherapeutic drugs for tumor therapy.

      <title>Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper&#8208;Phase Hybrid Halide Perovskite/Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Blend Memory Transistors</title>
      <dc:description>
Blending the organic semiconductor 2,7&#8208;dioctyl[1]benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b]benzothiophene (C8&#8208;BTBT) with the layered Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper&#8208;phase perovskite (PEA)2PbBr4 in solution phase facilitates the formation of large and near&#8208;single&#8208;crystalline&#8208;quality platelet&#8208;like perovskite domains overlaid by a thin layer of the organic molecule. Transistors utilizing the (PEA)2PbBr4/C8&#8208;BTBT bilayer as the channel exhibit unexpectedly large hysteresis, and their use as non&#8208;volatile memory element is demonstrated.








Abstract
Controlling the morphology of metal halide perovskite layers during processing is critical for the manufacturing of optoelectronics. Here, a strategy to control the microstructure of solution&#8208;processed layered Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper&#8208;phase perovskite films based on phenethylammonium lead bromide ((PEA)2PbBr4) is reported. The method relies on the addition of the organic semiconductor 2,7&#8208;dioctyl[1]benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b]benzothiophene (C8&#8208;BTBT) into the perovskite formulation, where it facilitates the formation of large, near&#8208;single&#8208;crystalline&#8208;quality platelet&#8208;like (PEA)2PbBr4 domains overlaid by a &#8776;5&#8208;nm&#8208;thin C8&#8208;BTBT layer. Transistors with (PEA)2PbBr4/C8&#8208;BTBT channels exhibit an unexpectedly large hysteresis window between forward and return bias sweeps. Material and device analysis combined with theoretical calculations suggest that the C8&#8208;BTBT&#8208;rich phase acts as the hole&#8208;transporting channel, while the quantum wells in (PEA)2PbBr4 act as the charge storage element where carriers from the channel are injected, stored, or extracted via tunneling.&#160;When tested as a non&#8208;volatile memory, the devices exhibit a record memory window (&gt;180&#160;V), a high erase/write channel current ratio (104), good data retention, and high endurance (&gt;104 cycles). The results here highlight a new memory device concept for application in large&#8208;area electronics, while the growth technique can potentially be exploited for the development of other optoelectronic devices including solar cells, photodetectors, and light&#8208;emitting diodes.

      <title>Epitaxial Growth of Single&#8208;Phase 1T'&#8208;WSe2 Monolayer with Assistance of Enhanced Interface Interaction</title>
      <dc:description>
The WSe2 monolayer in 1T&#8217; phase is a large&#8208;gap quantum spin Hall insulator, but is thermodynamically metastable. Thanks to the enhanced interface interaction, a single&#8208;phase 1T'&#8208;WSe2 monolayer is grown on SrTiO3(100) substrate using the molecular beam epitaxial method, and the interlayer in&#8208;plane strain also drives the 1T'&#8208;WSe2 into a semimetallic phase.

The WSe2 monolayer in 1T&#8217; phase is reported to be a large&#8208;gap quantum spin Hall insulator, but is thermodynamically metastable and so far the fabricated samples have always been in the mixed phase of 1T&#8217; and 2H, which has become a bottleneck for further exploration and potential applications of the nontrivial topological properties. Based on first&#8208;principle calculations in this work, it is found that the 1T&#8217; phase could be more stable than 2H phase with enhanced interface interactions. Inspired by this discovery, SrTiO3 (100) is chosen as substrate and WSe2 monolayer is successfully grown in a 100% single 1T&#8217; phase using the molecular beam epitaxial method. Combining in situ scanning tunneling microscopy and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements, it is found that the in&#8208;plane compressive strain in the interface drives the 1T'&#8208;WSe2 into a semimetallic phase. Besides providing a new material platform for topological states, the results show that the interface interaction is a new approach to control both the structure phase stability and the topological band structures of transition metal dichalcogenides.

      <title>Perovskite Quantum Wells Formation Mechanism for Stable Efficient Perovskite Photovoltaics&#8212;A Real&#8208;Time Phase&#8208;Transition Study</title>
      <dc:description>
The time&#8208;resolved grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering technique provides real&#8208;time insights on the phase&#8208;transition during the organic cation coating and perovskite quantum wells (PQWs)/3D architecture formation mechanism. With fluorinated poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) as a dopant&#8208;free hole&#8208;transport layer, this PQWs/3D architecture leads to stable perovskite photovoltaics with power conversion efficiency of &gt;22%.








Abstract
The combination of a bulk 3D perovskite layer and a reduced dimensional perovskite layer (perovskite quantum wells (PQWs)) is demonstrated to enhance the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) significantly in terms of stability and efficiency. This perovskite hierarchy has attracted intensive research interest; however, the in&#8208;depth formation mechanism of perovskite quantum wells on top of a 3D perovskite layer is not clearly understood and is therefore the focus of this study. Along with ex situ morphology and photophysical characterization, the time&#8208;resolved grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (TS&#8208;GIWAXS) technique performed in this study provides real&#8208;time insights on the phase&#8208;transition during the organic cation (HTAB ligand molecule) coating and PQWs/3D architecture formation process. A strikingly strong ionic reaction between the 3D perovskite and the long&#8208;chain organic cation leads to the quick formation of an ordered intermediate phase within only a few seconds. The optimal PQWs/3D&#160;architecture is achieved by controlling the HTAB casting, which is assisted by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight SIMS characterization. By controlling the second ionic reaction during the long&#8208;chain cation coating process, along with the fluorinated&#160;poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) as a hole&#8208;transport layer, the perovskite solar cells demonstrate efficiencies exceeding 22% along with drastically improved device stability.

      <title>Strategy of Enhancing the Volumetric Energy Density for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
The volumetric energy density (WV) of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries is critical for mobile applications. This review analyzes key factors that dominate WV, summarizes progress on WV research, and discusses technologies for tuning cathode structure. A &#8220;Three High One Low (THOL)&#8221; strategy is proposed for high WV and gravimetric energy density (WG), and catalytic hosts are important to unlock the sulfur electroactivity.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries hold the promise of the next generation energy storage system beyond state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Despite the attractive gravimetric energy density (WG), the volumetric energy density (WV) still remains a great challenge for the practical application, based on the primary requirement of Small and Light for Li&#8211;S batteries. This review highlights the importance of cathode density, sulfur content, electroactivity in achieving high energy densities. In the first part, key factors are analyzed in a model on negative/positive ratio, cathode design, and electrolyte/sulfur ratio, orientated toward energy densities of 700&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8722;1/500&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1. Subsequently, recent progresses on enhancing WV for coin/pouch cells are reviewed primarily on cathode. Especially, the &#8220;Three High One Low&#8221; (THOL) (high sulfur fraction, high sulfur loading, high density host, and low electrolyte quantity) is proposed as a feasible strategy for achieving high WV, taking high WG into consideration simultaneously. Meanwhile, host materials with desired catalytic activity should be paid more attention for fabricating high performance cathode. In the last part, key engineering technologies on manipulating the cathode porosity/density are discussed, including calendering and dry electrode coating. Finally, a future outlook is provided for enhancing both WV and WG of the Li&#8211;S batteries.

      <title>A Library of Atomically Thin 2D Materials Featuring the Conductive&#8208;Point Resistive Switching Phenomenon</title>
      <dc:description>
The library of atomically thin 2D materials featuring non&#8208;volatile resistive switching can provide a promising and broad platform for exploring the sub&#8208;nanometer scaling limit, which is beneficial for emerging device concepts. A dissociation&#8211;diffusion&#8211;adsorption (DDA) model is proposed to describe the common conductive&#8208;point mechanism behind 2D&#8208;materials&#8208;based universal resistive switching and supported by systematic density functional theory (DFT) calculations showing favorable adsorption of metal into native defects.








Abstract
Non&#8208;volatile resistive switching (NVRS) is a widely available effect in transitional metal oxides, colloquially known as memristors, and of broad interest for memory technology and neuromorphic computing. Until recently, NVRS was not known in other transitional metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), an important material class owing to their atomic thinness enabling the ultimate dimensional scaling. Here, various monolayer or few&#8208;layer 2D&#160;materials are presented in the conventional vertical structure that exhibit NVRS, including TMDs (MX2, M = transitional metal, e.g., Mo, W, Re, Sn, or Pt; X = chalcogen, e.g., S, Se, or Te), TMD heterostructure (WS2/MoS2), and an atomically thin insulator (h&#8208;BN). These results indicate the universality of the phenomenon in 2D non&#8208;conductive materials, and feature low switching voltage, large ON/OFF ratio, and forming&#8208;free characteristic. A&#160;dissociation&#8211;diffusion&#8211;adsorption model is proposed, attributing the enhanced conductance to metal atoms/ions adsorption into intrinsic vacancies, a conductive&#8208;point mechanism supported by first&#8208;principle calculations and scanning tunneling microscopy characterizations. The results motivate further research in the understanding and applications of defects in 2D materials.

      <title>Tunable Photocontrolled Motions of Anil&#8208;Poly(ethylene terephthalate) Systems through Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer and Trans&#8211;Cis Isomerization</title>
      <dc:description>
Multiple photoresponsive motions, excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer, and trans&#8211;cis isomerization, are combined into anil&#8208;poly(ethylene terephthalate) systems to achieve photocontrolled function with the aid of a stretching process.

Abstract
With the combination of excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer and trans&#8211;cis isomerization as microscopic molecular motions under light stimulus, multiple photodeformable processes are achieved in anil&#8208;poly(ethylene terephthalate) systems, including simple bending, dancing butterflies, and switches. The doping films can realize light&#8208;driven contraction as large as 70% and bending angle of about 141&#176;, upon a simple stretching process. The internal mechanism is confirmed by transient absorption spectra, and the relationship between molecular structure and photocontrolled motion is investigated by theoretical calculations and crystal analysis. This work provides a convenient approach by utilizing anils to fabricate reversible actuations with desirable geometries, greatly contributing to the applications and manufacturing of soft robots and related research.

The internal mechanism is confirmed by transient absorption spectra, and the relationship between molecular structure and photocontrolled motion is investigated by theoretical calculations and crystal analysis. This work provides a convenient approach by utilizing anils to fabricate reversible actuations with desirable geometries, greatly contributing to the applications and manufacturing of soft robots and related research.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nanoassemblies with Effective Serum Tolerance Capability Achieving Robust Gene Silencing Efficacy for Breast Cancer Gene Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
A new strategy of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) modification is proposed for constructing cationic polymers&#8208;based siRNA vectors with enhanced serum resistance. This PEG modification strategy does not consume free aminos of cationic polymers. The constructed siRNA vectors show robust gene silencing efficacy in the absence and presence of serum. In vivo, these vectors exhibit excellent antitumor effects and good biocompatibility.








Abstract
The transfection efficiency of siRNA mediated by cationic polymers is limited due to the instability of polymers/siRNA complexes in the presence of serum. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is usually applied to modify cationic polymers, so as to reduce protein and cell adsorption and then to improve siRNA transfection efficiency. However, the polymers&#8217; modification with PEG mostly consumes the free amino of the polymers, which can, in turn, reduce the charge density and limit their siRNA transfection efficacy. Here, a new PEG modification strategy that need not consume the surface aminos of polymers is proposed. Catechol&#8211;PEG polymers are coated on the surface of phenylboronic acid (PBA)&#8208;modified Generation 5 (G5) poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (G5PBA) via reversible boronate esters to establish PEG&#8208;modified dendrimer/siRNA nanoassemblies for efficient siRNA delivery. The PEG/G5PBA/siRNA nanoassemblies have positive charge and show excellent gene silencing efficacy in the absence of serum in vitro. More importantly, the PEG/G5PBA/siRNA nanoassemblies also exhibit excellent serum resistance and gene silencing efficacy in serum&#8208;containing medium. Furthermore, the effective antiserum and gene silencing efficacy elicited by these nanoassemblies lead to excellent antitumor effects in vivo. This proposed strategy constitutes an important approach to reach an excellent gene silencing efficacy in the presence of serum.

      <title>Light&#8208;Activated Stress Relaxation, Toughness Improvement, and Photoinduced Reversal of Physical Aging in Glassy Polymer Networks</title>
      <dc:description>
Reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) moieties are introduced into glassy copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) networks to promote spatiotemporally controlled dynamic bond exchange in the glassy state. As a result, unprecedented levels of stress relaxation, extended plastic deformation post yielding, and intriguing rejuvenation of mechanical properties in physically aged samples are achieved by activation of RAFT in the glassy state.








Abstract
A covalent adaptable network (CAN) with high glass transition temperature (Tg), superior mechanical properties including toughness and ductility, and unprecedented spatio&#8208;temporally controlled dynamic behavior is prepared by introducing dynamic moieties capable of reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) into photoinitiated copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC)&#8208;based networks. While the CuAAC polymerization yields glassy polymers composed of rigid triazole linkages with enhanced toughness, the RAFT moieties undergo bond exchange leading to stress relaxation upon light exposure. This unprecedented level of stress relaxation in the glassy state leads to numerous desirable attributes including glassy state photoinduced plasticity, toughness improvement during large deformation, and even photoinduced reversal of the effects of physical aging resulting in the rejuvenation of mechanical and thermodynamic properties in physically aged RAFT&#8208;CuAAC networks that undergo bond exchange in the glassy state. Surprisingly, when an allyl&#8208;sulfide&#8208;containing azide monomer (AS&#8208;N3) is used to form the network, the network exhibits up to 80% stress relaxation in the glassy state (Tg&#160;&#8722; 45 &#176;C) under fixed displacement. In situ activation of RAFT during mechanical loading results in a 50% improvement in elongation to break and 40% improvement in the toughness when compared to the same network without light&#8208;activation of RAFT during the tensile testing.

      <title>A Monochloro Copper Phthalocyanine Memristor with High&#8208;Temperature Resilience for Electronic Synapse Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
An organic memristor using small&#8208;molecule monochloro copper phthalocyanine as the active material is developed. The unencapsulated memristive devices exhibit high thermal resilience at 300 &#176;C, good flexibility, and high capability of simulating a variety of functions of biological synapses. This work offers an effective approach toward the implementation of brain&#8211;computer interface technology for high&#8208;temperature applications.








Abstract
Memristors are considered to be one of the most promising device concepts for neuromorphic computing, in particular thanks to their highly tunable resistive states. To realize neuromorphic computing architectures, the assembly of large memristive crossbar arrays is necessary, but is often accompanied by severe heat dispassion. Organic materials can be tailored with on&#8208;demand electronic properties in the context of neuromorphic applications. However, such materials are more susceptible to heat, and detrimental effects such as thermally induced degradation directly lead to failure of device operation. Here, an organic memristive synapse formed of monochloro copper phthalocyanine, which remains operational and capable of memristive switching at temperatures as high as 300 &#176;C in ambient air without any encapsulation, is demonstrated. The change in the electrical conductance is found to be a result of ion movement, closely resembling what takes place in biological neurons. Furthermore, the high viability of this approach is showcased by demonstrating flexible memristors with stable switching behaviors after repeated mechanical bending as well as organic synapses capable of emulating a trainable and reconfigurable memristor array for image information processing. The results set a precedent for thermally resilient organic synapses to impact organic neuromorphic devices in progressing their practicality.

      <title>Magnetoelectric Tuning of Pinning&#8208;Type Permanent Magnets through Atomic&#8208;Scale Engineering of Grain Boundaries</title>
      <dc:description>
Through injection of hydrogen atoms into grain boundaries, the coercivity of a Sm2Co17&#8208;based magnet is tuned by &#8776;1.3 T by applying &#8776;1 V. This work not only offers an effective route to achieve giant magneto&#8208;electric effects in metallic ferromagnets, but also unveils the neglected critical role of grain boundaries in determining the coercivity of pinning&#8208;type magnets.








Abstract
Pinning&#8208;type magnets with high coercivity at high temperatures are at the core of thriving clean&#8208;energy technologies. Among these, Sm2Co17&#8208;based magnets are excellent candidates owing to their high&#8208;temperature stability. However, despite intensive efforts to optimize the intragranular microstructure, the coercivity currently only reaches 20&#8211;30% of the theoretical limits. Here, the roles of the grain&#8208;interior nanostructure and the grain boundaries in controlling coercivity are disentangled by an emerging magnetoelectric approach. Through hydrogen charging/discharging by applying voltages of only &#8776;1&#160;V, the coercivity is reversibly tuned by an unprecedented value of &#8776;1.3 T. In situ magneto&#8208;structural characterization and atomic&#8208;scale tracking of hydrogen atoms reveal that the segregation of hydrogen atoms at the grain boundaries, rather than the change of the crystal structure, dominates the reversible and substantial change of coercivity. Hydrogen reduces the local magnetocrystalline anisotropy and facilitates the magnetization reversal starting from the grain boundaries. This study opens a way to achieve the giant magnetoelectric effect in permanent magnets by engineering grain boundaries with hydrogen atoms. Furthermore, it reveals the so far neglected critical role of grain boundaries in the conventional magnetization&#8208;switching paradigm of pinning&#8208;type magnets, suggesting a critical reconsideration of engineering strategies to overcome the coercivity limits.

      <title>Ultrasonic Interfacial Engineering of Red Phosphorous&#8211;Metal for Eradicating MRSA Infection Effectively</title>
      <dc:description>
A controllable sonothermal ability can be realized through interfacial engineering by constructing heterojunction interfaces between red phosphorous and metals (Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Co, and Ni). Ultrasound&#8208;excited electrons convert ultrasonic energy into heat through vibration, relaxation, and recombination in the heterointerface. Multidrug&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus can be eradicated efficiently by sonothermal effect and with thermally controlled release of nitric oxide gas.








Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is considered to be a potential treatment for various diseases including cancers and bacterial infections due to its deep penetration ability and biosafety, but its SDT efficiency is limited by the hypoxia environment of deep tissues. This study proposes creating a potential solution, sonothermal therapy, by developing the ultrasonic interfacial engineering of metal&#8211;red phosphorus (RP), which has an obviously improved sonothermal ability of more than 20 &#176;C elevation under 25 min of continuous ultrasound (US) excitation as compared to metal alone. The underlying mechanism is that the mechanical energy of the US activates the motion of the interfacial electrons. US&#8208;induced electron motion in the RP can efficiently transfer the US energy into phonons in the forms of heat and lattice vibrations, resulting in a stronger US absorption of metal&#8211;RP. Unlike the nonspecific heating of the cavitation effect induced by US, titanium&#8211;RP can be heated in situ when the US penetrates through 2.5&#160;cm of pork tissue. In addition, through a sonothermal treatment in vivo, bone infection induced by multidrug&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is successfully eliminated in under 20 min of US without tissue damage. This work provides a new strategy for combating MRSA by strong sonothermal therapy through US interfacial engineering.

In addition, through a sonothermal treatment in vivo, bone infection induced by multidrug&#8208;resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (MRSA) is successfully eliminated in under 20 min of US without tissue damage. This work provides a new strategy for combating MRSA by strong sonothermal therapy through US interfacial engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Deep&#8208;Blue Perovskite Single&#8208;Mode Lasing through Efficient Vapor&#8208;Assisted Chlorination</title>
      <dc:description>
Deep&#8208;blue laser sources are of interest in lithography, microscopy, and medical and scientific devices; and lasers have, until now, been limited to bulky gas laser systems and III&#8211;V semiconductor devices. A new strategy to achieve deep&#8208;blue emitting perovskite films, and the prospect of extending the range of deep&#8208;blue/near UV laser sources are reported.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites have emerged as promising candidates for solution&#8208;processed laser gain materials, with impressive performance in the green and red spectral regions. Despite exciting progress, deep&#8208;blue&#8212;an important wavelength for laser applications&#8212;remains underexplored; indeed, cavity integration and single&#8208;mode lasing from large&#8208;bandgap perovskites have yet to be achieved. Here,&#160;a vapor&#8208;assisted chlorination strategy that enables synthesis of low&#8208;dimensional CsPbCl3&#160;thin films exhibiting deep&#8208;blue emission is reported. Using this approach,&#160; high&#8208;quality perovskite thin films having a low surface roughness (RMS &#8776; 1.3&#160;nm) and efficient charge transfer properties are achieved. These enable us to document low&#8208;threshold amplified spontaneous emission. Levering the high quality of the gain medium,&#160; vertical&#8208;cavity surface&#8208;emitting lasers with a low lasing threshold of 6.5 &#181;J cm&#8722;2&#160;are fabricated. This report of deep&#8208;blue perovskite single&#8208;mode lasing showcases the prospect of increasing the range of deep&#8208;blue laser sources.

      <title>Efficient Hydrogen Evolution of Oxidized Ni&#8208;N3 Defective Sites for Alkaline Freshwater and Seawater Electrolysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Seawater electrolysis is an attractive alternative to traditional freshwater electrolysis due to the abundance of seawater. A&#160;novel Ni single&#8208;atom catalyst with oxidized Ni&#8208;N3 and Ni&#8208;N4 coordination is developed to achieve efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance in alkaline seawater electrolytes. Both experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the low&#8208;coordinated Ni&#8208;N3 facilitates water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption during HER.








Abstract
For mass production of high&#8208;purity hydrogen fuel by electrochemical water splitting, seawater electrolysis is an attractive alternative to the traditional freshwater electrolysis due to the abundance and low cost of seawater in nature. However, the undesirable chlorine ion oxidation reactions occurring simultaneously with seawater electrolysis greatly hinder the overall performance of seawater electrolysis. To tackle this problem, electrocatalysts of high activity and selectivity with purposely modulated coordination and an alkaline environment are urgently required. Herein, it is demonstrated that atomically dispersed Ni with triple nitrogen coordination (Ni&#8208;N3) can achieve efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance in alkaline media. The atomically dispersed Ni electrocatalysts exhibit overpotentials as low as 102 and 139&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8211;2 in alkaline freshwater and seawater electrolytes, respectively, which compare favorably with those previously reported. They also deliver large current densities beyond 200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8211;2 at lower overpotentials than Pt/C, as well as show negligible current attenuation over 14 h. The X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) experimental analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations verify that the Ni&#8208;N3 coordination, which exhibits a lower coordination number than Ni&#8208;N4, facilitates water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption, and hence enhances the HER activity.

      <title>Sensing of COVID&#8208;19 Antibodies in Seconds via Aerosol Jet Nanoprinted Reduced&#8208;Graphene&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Coated 3D Electrodes</title>
      <dc:description>
A ten&#8208;second COVID&#8208;19 antibody test is developed, which represents the fastest detection of this pathogenic biomarker. The test uses 3D nanoprinted electrodes coated with reduced&#8208;graphene&#8208;oxide and viral antigens. The COVID&#8208;19 sensor can be reused 9 times and is connected to a smartphone interface for a convenient readout. This sensing technology is a powerful tool that will greatly benefit public health.








Abstract
Rapid diagnosis is critical for the treatment and prevention of diseases. An advanced nanomaterial&#8208;based biosensing platform that&#160;detects COVID&#8208;19 antibodies within seconds is reported. The biosensing platform is created by 3D nanoprinting of three&#8208;dimensional electrodes, coating the electrodes by nanoflakes of&#160;reduced&#8208;graphene&#8208;oxide&#160;(rGO), and immobilizing specific viral antigens on the rGO nanoflakes. The electrode is then integrated with a microfluidic device and used in a standard electrochemical cell. When antibodies are introduced on the electrode surface, they selectively bind with the antigens, changing the impedance of the electrical circuit which is detected via impedance spectroscopy. Antibodies to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike S1 protein and its&#160;receptor&#8208;binding&#8208;domain (RBD)&#160;are detected&#160;at a limit&#8208;of&#8208;detection of 2.8&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;15 and 16.9&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;15 m,&#160;respectively,&#160;and read by a smartphone&#8208;based user interface. The sensor can be regenerated within a minute by introducing a low&#8208;pH chemistry that elutes the antibodies from the antigens, allowing successive&#160;sensing&#160;of&#160;test&#160;samples using the same sensor. Sensing of S1 and RBD antibodies is specific, which cross&#8208;reacts neither with other antibodies such as RBD, S1, and nucleocapsid antibody nor with proteins such as interleukin&#8208;6. The proposed sensing platform could also be useful to detect biomarkers for other infectious agents such as Ebola, HIV, and Zika.

      <title>Kirigami Engineering&#8212;Nanoscale Structures Exhibiting a Range of Controllable 3D Configurations</title>
      <dc:description>
This work studies the effect of the thickness of a single nanoscale 3D kirigami structure with two distinct out&#8208;of&#8208;plane tilting configurations. The findings represent a new step in the characterization of thin films experiencing buckling&#8208;induced out of plane shape transformations and provide a new degree of freedom to control 3D configurations of micro&#8208; and nanoscale buckling&#8208;induced kirigami structures.








Abstract
Kirigami structures provide a promising approach to transform flat films into 3D complex structures that are difficult to achieve by conventional fabrication approaches. By designing the cutting geometry, it is shown that distinct buckling&#8208;induced out&#8208;of&#8208;plane configurations can be obtained, separated by a sharp transition characterized by a critical geometric dimension of the structures. In situ electron microscopy experiments reveal the effect of the ratio between the in&#8208;plane cut size and film thickness on out&#8208;of&#8208;plane configurations. Moreover, geometrically nonlinear finite element analyses (FEA) accurately predict the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane modes measured experimentally, their transition as a function of cut geometry, and provide the stress&#8211;strain response of the kirigami structures. The combined computational&#8211;experimental approach and results reported here represent a step forward in the characterization of thin films experiencing buckling&#8208;induced out&#8208;of&#8208;plane shape transformations and provide a path to control 3D configurations of micro&#8208; and nanoscale buckling&#8208;induced kirigami structures. The out&#8208;of&#8208;plane configurations promise great utility in the creation of micro&#8208; and nanoscale systems that can harness such structural behavior, such as optical scanning micromirrors, novel actuators, and nanorobotics. This work is of particular significance as the kirigami dimensions approach the sub&#8208;micrometer scale which is challenging to achieve with conventional micro&#8208;electromechanical system technologies.

      <title>Quantum Rescaling, Domain Metastability, and Hybrid Domain&#8208;Walls in 2D CrI3 Magnets</title>
      <dc:description>
Higher&#8208;order exchange and quantum effects are widely known to play an important role in nanomagnets. However, it is unclear whether they are important in recently discovered 2D magnets. It is shown that biquadratic exchange interactions and quantum&#8208;rescaling corrections are the keys on the long&#8208;range ordering of 2D CrI3 layers. Metastability induces domain walls of hybrid types with different chirality.








Abstract
Higher&#8208;order exchange interactions and quantum effects are widely known to play an important role in describing the properties of low&#8208;dimensional magnetic compounds. Here, the recently discovered 2D van der Waals (vdW) CrI3 is identified as a quantum non&#8208;Heisenberg material with properties far beyond an Ising magnet as initially assumed. It is found that biquadratic exchange interactions are essential to quantitatively describe the magnetism of CrI3 but quantum rescaling corrections are required to reproduce its thermal properties. The quantum nature of the heat bath represented by discrete electron&#8211;spin and phonon&#8211;spin scattering processes induces the formation of spin fluctuations in the low&#8208;temperature regime. These fluctuations induce the formation of metastable magnetic domains evolving into a single macroscopic magnetization or even a monodomain over surface areas of a few micrometers. Such domains display hybrid characteristics of N&#233;el and Bloch types with a narrow domain wall width in the range of 3&#8211;5 nm. Similar behavior is expected for the majority of 2D vdW magnets where higher&#8208;order exchange interactions are appreciable.

      <title>Failing Forward: Stability of Transparent Electrodes Based on Metal Nanowire Networks</title>
      <dc:description>
Metal nanowire (MNW)&#8208;based transparent electrode technology is a promising low&#8208;cost alternative to indium tin oxide, offering mechanical flexibility and low materials cost. The fundamental failure mechanisms of MNWs, strategies to computationally model MNW networks, characterization strategies, and encapsulation strategies are discussed. Lastly, a perspective on evaluating MNW&#8208;based electrodes based on their technological relevance and cost is presented.








Abstract
Metal nanowire (MNW)&#8208;based transparent electrode technologies have significantly matured over the last decade to become a prominent low&#8208;cost alternative to indium tin oxide (ITO). Beyond reaching the same level of performance as ITO, MNW networks offer additional advantages including flexibility and low materials cost. To facilitate adoption of MNW networks as a replacement to ITO, they must overcome their inherent stability issues while maintaining their properties and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Herein, the fundamental failure mechanisms of MNW networks are discussed in detail. Recent strategies to computationally model MNWs from the nano&#8208; to macroscale and suggest future work to capture dynamic failure to unravel mechanisms that account for convolution of the failure modes are highlighted. Strategies to characterize MNW network failure in situ and postmortem are also discussed. In addition, recent work about improving the stability of MNW networks via encapsulation is discussed. Lastly, a perspective is given on how to frame the requirements of MNW&#8208;encapsulant hybrids with reference to their target applications, namely: solar cells, transparent film heaters, sensors, and displays. A cost analysis to comment on the feasibility of implementing MNW hybrids is provided, and critical areas to focus on for future work on MNW networks are suggested.

      <dc:description>
Self&#8208;healing materials are exciting avenues toward sustainable and intelligent long lifespan robots. The history and recent advances in material strategies for self&#8208;healing in robotics and stretchable electronics toward future development of the fully autonomous self&#8208;healing robots are reviewed.








Abstract
Robots are increasingly assisting humans in performing various tasks. Like special agents with elite skills, they can venture to distant locations and adverse environments, such as the deep sea and outer space. Micro/nanobots can also act as intrabody agents for healthcare applications. Self&#8208;healing materials that can autonomously perform repair functions are useful to address the unpredictability of the environment and the increasing drive toward the autonomous operation. Having self&#8208;healable robotic materials can potentially reduce costs, electronic wastes, and improve a robot endowed with such materials longevity. This review aims to serve as a roadmap driven by past advances and inspire future cross&#8208;disciplinary research in robotic materials and electronics. By first charting the history of self&#8208;healing materials, new avenues are provided to classify the various self&#8208;healing materials proposed over several decades. The materials and strategies for self&#8208;healing in robotics and stretchable electronics are also reviewed and discussed. It is believed that this article encourages further innovation in this exciting and emerging branch in robotics interfacing with material science and electronics.

      <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Enabled through Nacre&#8208;Mimetic Nanocomposite Design</title>
      <dc:description>
A general and facile self&#8208;assembly strategy for fabricating high&#8208;performance films with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), based on nacre&#8208;mimetic nanocomposite design is proposed. The laminated nanoclay endows the films with tunable oxygen permeability, and programmable retention times of RTP signals can be achieved. Applications including oxygen sensors and photolithographic RTP tags, and a new anti&#8208;interception concept are demonstrated.








Abstract
A generic, facile, and waterborne strategy is introduced to fabricate flexible, low&#8208;cost nanocomposite films with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) by incorporating waterborne RTP polymers into self&#8208;assembled bioinspired polymer/nanoclay nanocomposites. The excellent oxygen barrier of the lamellar nanoclay structure suppresses the quenching effect from ambient oxygen (kq) and broadens the choice of polymer matrices towards lower glass transition temperature (Tg), while providing better mechanical properties and processability.

     alt="Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Enabled through Nacre&#8208;Mimetic Nanocomposite Design"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A general and facile self&#8208;assembly strategy for fabricating high&#8208;performance films with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), based on nacre&#8208;mimetic nanocomposite design is proposed. The laminated nanoclay endows the films with tunable oxygen permeability, and programmable retention times of RTP signals can be achieved. Applications including oxygen sensors and photolithographic RTP tags, and a new anti&#8208;interception concept are demonstrated.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A generic, facile, and waterborne strategy is introduced to fabricate flexible, low&#8208;cost nanocomposite films with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) by incorporating waterborne RTP polymers into self&#8208;assembled bioinspired polymer/nanoclay nanocomposites. The excellent oxygen barrier of the lamellar nanoclay structure suppresses the quenching effect from ambient oxygen (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;) and broadens the choice of polymer matrices towards lower glass transition temperature (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;), while providing better mechanical properties and processability. Moreover, the oxygen permeation and diffusion inside the films can be fine&#8208;tuned by varying the polymer/nanoclay ratio, enabling programmable retention times of the RTP signals, which is exploited for transient information storage and anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials. Additionally, anti&#8208;interception materials are showcased by tracing the interception&#8208;induced oxygen history that interferes with the preset self&#8208;erasing time. Merging bioinspired nanocomposite design with RTP materials contributes to overcoming the inherent limitations of molecular design of organic RTP compounds, and allows programmable temporal features to be added into RTP materials by controlled mesostructures. This will assist in paving the way for practical applications of RTP materials as novel anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Electrochemiluminescent Transistors: A New Strategy toward Light&#8208;Emitting Switching Devices</title>
      <dc:description>
An electrochemiluminescent (ECL)&#8208;principle&#8208;based approach to demonstrate high&#8208;performance light&#8208;emitting transistors (LETs) is introduced. Exploiting a solid electrolyte with an ECL luminophore (ECL Gel) as a gate insulator, p&#8208;, n&#8208;, and ambipolar LETs are successfully realized. Not only light&#8208;emitting materials, but conventional semiconductors can be employed for high&#8208;mobility and uniform light&#8208;emission, providing new opportunities for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Light&#8208;emitting transistors (LETs) have attracted a significant amount of interest as multifunctional building blocks for next&#8208;generation electronics and optoelectronic devices. However, it is challenging to obtain LETs with a high carrier mobility and uniform light&#8208;emission because the semiconductor channel should provide both the electrical charge transport and optical light&#8208;emission, and typical emissive semiconductors have low, imbalanced carrier mobilities. In this work, a novel device platform that adapts the electrochemiluminescence (ECL) principle in LETs, referred to as an ECL transistor (ECLT) is proposed. ECL is a light&#8208;emission phenomenon from electrochemically excited luminophores generated by redox reactions. A solid&#8208;state ECL electrolyte consisting of a network&#8208;forming polymer, ionic liquid, luminophore, and co&#8208;reactant is employed as the light&#8208;emitting gate insulator of the ECLT. Based on this construction, high&#8208;performance LETs that make use of various conventional non&#8208;emissive semiconductors (e.g., poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene), zinc oxide, and reduced graphene oxide) are successfully demonstrated. All the devices exhibit a high mobility (0.9&#8211;10 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and a uniform light&#8208;emission. This innovative approach demonstrates a novel LET platform and provides a promising pathway to achieve significant breakthroughs to develop electronic circuits and optoelectronic applications.

      <title>Mapping of Texture and Phase Fractions in Heterogeneous Stress States during Multiaxial Loading of Biomedical Superelastic NiTi</title>
      <dc:description>
Thermoelastic deformation mechanisms in polycrystalline biomedical&#8208;grade superelastic NiTi are spatially mapped using in situ neutron diffraction during multi&#8208;axial loading and heating. The similarity in R&#8208;phase variant behavior between uniaxial and torsional loading, in spite of the heterogeneous stress state associated with torsional loading is discussed along with its ability to accommodate the resulting stress and strain mismatch.








Abstract
Thermoelastic deformation mechanisms in polycrystalline biomedical&#8208;grade superelastic NiTi are spatially mapped using in situ neutron diffraction during multiaxial loading and heating. The trigonal R&#8208;phase is formed from the cubic phase during cooling to room temperature and subsequently deforms in compression, tension, and torsion. The resulting R&#8208;phase variant microstructure from the variant reorientation and detwinning processes are equivalent for the corresponding strain in tension and compression, and the variant microstructure is reversible by isothermal loading. The R&#8208;phase variant microstructure is consistent between uniaxial and torsional loading when the principal stress directions of the stress state are considered (for the crystallographic directions observed here). The variant microstructure evolution is tracked and the similarity in general behavior between uniaxial and torsional loading, in spite of the implicit heterogeneous stress state associated with torsional loading, pointed to the ability of the reversible thermoelastic transformation in NiTi to accommodate stress and strain mismatch with deformation. This ability of the R&#8208;phase, despite its limited variants, to accommodate stress and strain and satisfy strain incompatibility in addition to the existing internal stresses has significance for reducing irrecoverable deformation mechanisms during loading and cycling through the phase transformation.

Abstract
Miniature soft robots are mobile devices, which are made of smart materials that can be actuated by external stimuli to realize their desired functionalities. Here, the key advancements and challenges of the locomotion producible by miniature soft robots in micro&#8208; to centimeter length scales are highlighted. It is highly desirable to endow these small machines with dexterous locomotive gaits as it enables them to easily access highly confined and enclosed spaces via a noninvasive manner. If miniature soft robots are able to capitalize this unique ability, they will have the potential to transform a vast range of applications, including but not limited to, minimally invasive medical treatments, lab&#8208;on&#8208;chip applications, and search&#8208;and&#8208;rescue missions. The gaits of miniature soft robots are categorized into terrestrial, aquatic, and aerial locomotion. Except for the centimeter&#8208;scale robots that can perform aerial locomotion, the discussions in this report are centered around soft robots that are in the micro&#8208; to millimeter length scales. Under each category of locomotion, prospective methods and strategies that can improve their gait performances are also discussed. This report provides critical analyses and discussions that can inspire future strategies to make miniature soft robots significantly more agile.

In future, robots will be seamlessly integrated in everyday life and&#8212;as much as consumer electronics is omnipresent today&#8212;assist in a myriad of tasks.

Abstract
The advancement of technology has a profound and far&#8208;reaching impact on the society, now penetrating all areas of life. From cradle to grave, one is supported by and depends on a wide range of electronic and robotic appliances, with an ever more intimate integration of the digital and biological spheres. These advances, however, often come at the price of negatively impacting our ecosystem, with growing demands on energy, contributions to greenhouse gas emissions and environmental pollution&#8212;from production to improper disposal. Mitigating these adverse effects is among the grand challenges of the society and at the forefront of materials research. The currently emerging forms of soft, biologically inspired electronics and robotics have the unique potential of becoming not only like their natural antitypes in performance and capabilities, but also in terms of their ecological footprint. This review outlines the rise of sustainable materials in soft and bioinspired robotics, targeting all robotic components from actuators to energy storage and electronics. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in biobased robotics spans flourishing fields and applications ranging from microbots operating in vivo to biohybrid machines and fully biodegradable yet resilient actuators.

      <title>Tunnel Intergrowth LixMnO2 Nanosheet Arrays as 3D Cathode for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Thin Film Lithium Microbatteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Tunnel intergrowth LixMnO2 nanosheet arrays consisting of alternating 1 &#215; 3 and 1 &#215; 2 tunnels are developed by a facile electrolyte Li+ ion infusion method at a low temperature of 180 &#176;C. Benefiting from the stable tunnel structure for the cathode and favorable architecture with abundant 3D cathode/electrolyte interface, the constructed LixMnO2/LiPON/Li thin film battery achieves large specific capacity and outstanding cycle life.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state thin film lithium batteries (TFBs) are proposed as the ideal power sources for microelectronic devices. However, the high&#8208;temperature (&gt;500 &#176;C) annealing process of cathode films, such as LiCoO2 and LiMn2O4, restricts the on&#8208;chip integration and potential applications of TFBs. Herein, tunnel structured LixMnO2 nanosheet arrays are fabricated as 3D cathode for TFBs by a facile electrolyte Li+ ion infusion method at very low temperature of 180 &#176;C. Featuring an interesting tunnel intergrowth structure consisting of alternating 1 &#215; 3 and 1 &#215; 2 tunnels, the LixMnO2 cathode shows high specific capacity with good structural stability between 2.0 and 4.3 V (vs. Li+/Li). By utilizing the 3D LixMnO2 cathode, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LixMnO2/LiPON/Li TFB (3DLMO&#8208;TFB) has been successfully constructed with prominent advantages of greatly enriched cathode/electrolyte interface and shortened Li+ diffusion length in the 3D structure. Consequently, the 3DLMO&#8208;TFB device exhibits large specific capacity (185 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50 mA g&#8722;1), good rate performance, and excellent cycle performance (81.3% capacity retention after 1000 cycles), outperforming the TFBs using spinel LiMn2O4 thin film cathodes fabricated at high temperature. Importantly, the low&#8208;temperature preparation of high&#8208;performance cathode film enables the fabrication of TFBs on various rigid and flexible substrates, which could greatly expand their potential applications in microelectronics.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All&#8208;solid&#8208;state thin film lithium batteries (TFBs) are proposed as the ideal power sources for microelectronic devices. However, the high&#8208;temperature (&amp;gt;500 &#176;C) annealing process of cathode films, such as LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and LiMn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4,&lt;/sub&gt; restricts the on&#8208;chip integration and potential applications of TFBs. Herein, tunnel structured Li&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheet arrays are fabricated as 3D cathode for TFBs by a facile electrolyte Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion infusion method at very low temperature of 180 &#176;C. Featuring an interesting tunnel intergrowth structure consisting of alternating 1 &#215; 3 and 1 &#215; 2 tunnels, the Li&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode shows high specific capacity with good structural stability between 2.0 and 4.3 V (vs. Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Li). By utilizing the 3D Li&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/LiPON/Li TFB (3DLMO&#8208;TFB) has been successfully constructed with prominent advantages of greatly enriched cathode/electrolyte interface and shortened Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion length in the 3D structure. Consequently, the 3DLMO&#8208;TFB device exhibits large specific capacity (185 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 50 mA g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), good rate performance, and excellent cycle performance (81.3% capacity retention after 1000 cycles), outperforming the TFBs using spinel LiMn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; thin film cathodes fabricated at high temperature. Importantly, the low&#8208;temperature preparation of high&#8208;performance cathode film enables the fabrication of TFBs on various rigid and flexible substrates, which could greatly expand their potential applications in microelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extremely Fast Optical and Nonvolatile Control of Mixed&#8208;Phase Multiferroic BiFeO3 via Instantaneous Strain Perturbation</title>
      <dc:description>
All&#8208;optical manipulation of the complex phases and domain structures in multiferroic BiFeO3 thin films on ultrafast timescale is demonstrated by adoption of extremely short light pulses. The configuration of large&#8208;area optically written domains can be controlled by tuning the competing elastic and electrostatic energies. These results offer a novel route for development of all&#8208;optical switchable devices and high&#8208;speed multifunctional optoelectronics.








Abstract
Multiferroics&#8212;materials that exhibit coupled ferroic orders&#8212;are considered to be one of the most promising candidate material systems for next&#8208;generation spintronics, memory, low&#8208;power nanoelectronics and so on. To advance potential applications, approaches that lead to persistent and extremely fast functional property changes are in demand. Herein, it is revealed that the phase transition and the correlated ferroic orders in multiferroic BiFeO3 (BFO) can be modulated via illumination of single short/ultrashort light pulses. Heat transport simulations and ultrafast optical pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy reveal that the transient strain induced by light pulses plays a key role in determining the persistent final states. Having identified the diffusionless phase transformation features via scanning transmission electron microscopy, sequential laser pulse illumination is further demonstrated to perform large&#8208;area phase and domain manipulation in a deterministic way. The work contributes to all&#8208;optical and rapid nonvolatile control of multiferroicity, offering different routes while designing novel optoelectronics.

      <title>Anharmonicity&#8208;Driven Rashba Cohelical Excitons Break Quantum Efficiency Limitation</title>
      <dc:description>
An emission mechanism of lead halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLED) is revealed in which A&#8208;site cation disorder caused by unstable non&#8208;centrosymmetric vibrations plays a crucial role. The subsequent disorder of A&#8208;site cation leads to Rashba spin&#8208;orbit coupling and the lowest&#8208;lying bright cohelical exciton state. This allows for PeLED to overcome the internal 25% efficiency limitation of closed&#8208;shell LEDs.








Abstract
Closed&#8208;shell light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) suffer from the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) limitation imposed by optically inactive triplet excitons. Here, an unrevealed emission mechanism of lead halide perovskites (LHPs) APbX3 (A&#160;=&#160;Cs/CN2H5; X&#160;=&#160;Cl/Br/I) that circumvents the efficiency limit of closed&#8208;shell LEDs is explored. Though efficient emission is prohibited by optically inactive J&#160;=&#160;0 in inversion symmetric LHPs, the anharmonicity arising from stereochemistry of Pb and resonant orbital&#8208;bonding network along the imaginary A+&#8230;X&#8722;(T1u) transverse optical (TO) modes, breaks inversion symmetry, introducing disorder and Rashba&#8211;Dresselhaus spin&#8208;orbit coupling (RD&#8208;SOC). This results in bright cohelical and dark antihelical excitons. Many&#8208;body theory and first&#8208;principles calculations show that the optically active cohelical exciton is the lowest excited state in organic/inorganic LHPs. Thus, RD&#8208;SOC can drive to achieve the ideal 50% IQE by utilizing anharmonicity, much over the 25% IQE limitation for closed&#8208;shell LEDs.

      <title>Direct Magnetic Reinforcement of Electrocatalytic ORR/OER with Electromagnetic Induction of Magnetic Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
An external magnetic field increases the probability of spin polarization of magnetic metal nanoparticles and thus can enhance their oxygen reduction and evolution reaction (ORR/OER) catalytic activity. In this paper, carbon&#8208;based bifunctional catalysts of magnetic catalytic nanocages are fabricated by uniformly embedding cobalt nanoparticles into macroporous carbon nanofibers. The direct magnetic enhancement is verified by investigating the electrocatalytic ORR/OER performance under an external magnetic field.








Abstract
Designing stable and efficient electrocatalysts for both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER) at low&#8208;cost is challenging. Here, a carbon&#8208;based bifunctional catalyst of magnetic catalytic nanocages that can direct enhance the oxygen catalytic activity by simply applying a moderate (350 mT) magnetic field is reported. The catalysts, with high porosity of 90% and conductivity of 905 S m&#8722;1, are created by in situ doping metallic cobalt nanodots (&#8776;10&#160;nm) into macroporous carbon nanofibers with a facile electrospinning method. An external magnetic field makes the cobalt magnetized into nanomagnets with high spin polarization, which promote the adsorption of oxygen&#8208;intermediates and electron transfer, significantly improving the catalytic efficiency. Impressively, the half wave&#8208;potential is increased by 20&#160;mV for ORR, and the overpotential at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 is decreased by 15&#160;mV for OER. Compared with the commercial Pt/C+IrO2 catalysts, the magnetic catalyzed Zn&#8211;air batteries deliver 2.5&#8208;fold of capacities and exhibit much longer durability over 155 h. The findings point out a very promising strategy of using electromagnetic induction to boost oxygen catalytic activity.

      <title>Biomaterials and 3D Bioprinting Strategies to Model Glioblastoma and the Blood&#8211;Brain Barrier</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent progress on 3D&#8208;bioprinted models of glioblastoma and the blood&#8211;brain barrier are reviewed. In order to inform future design and implementation of 3D modeling, cellular and extracellular matrix components of the native tissue microenvironments, relevant natural and synthetic biomaterials and various 3D bioprinting strategies are discussed in detail.








Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent and lethal adult primary central nervous system cancer. An immunosuppresive and highly heterogeneous tumor microenvironment, restricted delivery of chemotherapy or immunotherapy through the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB), together with the brain's unique biochemical and anatomical features result in its universal recurrence and poor prognosis. As conventional models fail to predict therapeutic efficacy in GBM, in vitro 3D models of GBM and BBB leveraging patient&#8208; or healthy&#8208;individual&#8208;derived cells and biomaterials through 3D bioprinting technologies potentially mimic essential physiological and pathological features of GBM and BBB. 3D&#8208;bioprinted constructs enable investigation of cellular and cell&#8211;extracellular matrix interactions in a species&#8208;matched, high&#8208;throughput, and reproducible manner, serving as screening or drug delivery platforms. Here, an overview of current 3D&#8208;bioprinted GBM and BBB models is provided, elaborating on the microenvironmental compositions of GBM and BBB, relevant biomaterials to mimic the native tissues, and bioprinting strategies to implement the model fabrication. Collectively, 3D&#8208;bioprinted GBM and BBB models are promising systems and biomimetic alternatives to traditional models for more reliable mechanistic studies and preclinical drug screenings that may eventually accelerate the drug development process for GBM.

      <title>A High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Battery with Ion&#8208;Selective Nanofluidic Transport in a Conjugated Microporous Polymer Protective Layer</title>
      <dc:description>
Solution&#8208;processable conjugated microporous polymers are developed as protective layers for lithium anodes to achieve high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries with a long cycle life. A pouch cell fabricated using CMP&#8208;modified lithium foil achieves an energy density exceeding 400 Wh kg&#8722;1 and cycle stability &gt;65 cycles.








Abstract
Lithium metal is the &#8220;holy grail&#8221; of anodes, capable of unlocking the full potential of cathodes in next&#8208;generation batteries. However, the use of pure lithium anodes faces several challenges in terms of safety, cycle life, and rate capability. Herein, a solution&#8208;processable conjugated microporous thermosetting polymer (CMP) is developed. The CMP can be further converted into a large&#8208;scale membrane with nanofluidic channels (5&#8211;6 &#197;). These channels can serve as facile and selective Li&#8208;ion diffusion pathways on the surfaces of lithium anodes, thereby ensuring stable lithium stripping/plating even at high areal current densities. CMP&#8208;modified lithium anodes (CMP&#8208;Li) exhibit cycle stability of 2550 h at an areal current density of 20 mA cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, CMP is readily amenable to solution&#8208;processing and spray coating, rendering it highly applicable to continuous roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll lithium metal treatment processes.

&lt;p&gt;Solution&#8208;processable conjugated microporous polymers are developed as protective layers for lithium anodes to achieve high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries with a long cycle life. A pouch cell fabricated using CMP&#8208;modified lithium foil achieves an energy density exceeding 400 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and cycle stability &amp;gt;65 cycles.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium metal is the &#8220;holy grail&#8221; of anodes, capable of unlocking the full potential of cathodes in next&#8208;generation batteries. However, the use of pure lithium anodes faces several challenges in terms of safety, cycle life, and rate capability. Herein, a solution&#8208;processable conjugated microporous thermosetting polymer (CMP) is developed. The CMP can be further converted into a large&#8208;scale membrane with nanofluidic channels (5&#8211;6 &#197;). These channels can serve as facile and selective Li&#8208;ion diffusion pathways on the surfaces of lithium anodes, thereby ensuring stable lithium stripping/plating even at high areal current densities. CMP&#8208;modified lithium anodes (CMP&#8208;Li) exhibit cycle stability of 2550 h at an areal current density of 20 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, CMP is readily amenable to solution&#8208;processing and spray coating, rendering it highly applicable to continuous roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll lithium metal treatment processes. Pouch cells with CMP&#8208;Li as the anode and LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NCM811) as the cathode exhibits a stable energy density of 400 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In Operando Modulation of Rectification in Molecular Tunneling Junctions Comprising Reconfigurable Molecular Self&#8208;Assemblies</title>
      <dc:description>
Large&#8208;area molecular tunneling junctions embedded in microfluidic channels convert information encoded in chemical packets into electrical signals by reconstituting themselves through chemical exchange while in operation.








Abstract
The reconfiguration of molecular tunneling junctions during operation via the self&#8208;assembly of bilayers of glycol ethers is described. Well&#8208;established functional groups are used to modulate the magnitude and direction of rectification in assembled tunneling junctions by exposing them to solutions containing different glycol ethers. Variable&#8208;temperature measurements confirm that rectification occurs by the expected bias&#8208;dependent tunneling&#8211;hopping mechanism for these functional groups and that glycol ethers, besides being an unusually efficient tunneling medium, behave similarly to alkanes. Memory bits are fabricated from crossbar junctions prepared by injecting eutectic Ga&#8211;In (EGaIn) into microfluidic channels. The states of two 8&#8208;bit registers were set by trains of droplets such that they are able to perform logical AND operations on bit strings encoded into chemical packets that alter the composition of the crossbar junctions through self&#8208;assembly to effect memristor&#8208;like properties. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept work demonstrates the potential for fieldable devices based on molecular tunneling junctions comprising self&#8208;assembled monolayers and&#160;bilayers.

      <dc:description>
The distinct physical origin of 2D polarizations and modulation on degrees of freedom are comprehensively summarized based on the hysteresis behaviors and interface effects. The novel multifunctional polarized devices are discussed, from which perspectives and guidelines are proposed for developing the &#8220;Beyond Moore&#8221; integrated devices and circuits.








Abstract
The emergence of 2D polarized materials, including ferromagnetic, ferrovalley, and ferroelectric materials, has demonstrated unique quantum behaviors at atomic scales. These polarization behaviors are tightly bonded to the new degrees of freedom (DOFs) for next generation information storage and processing, which have been dramatically developed in the past few years. Here, the basic 2D polarized materials system and related devices&#8217; application in spintronics, valleytronics, and electronics are reviewed. Specifically, the underlying physical mechanism accompanied with symmetry broken theory and the modulation process through heterostructure engineering are highlighted. These summarized works focusing on the 2D polarization would continue to enrich the cognition of 2D quantum system and promising practical applications.

      <title>3D&#8208;Bioprinted Inflammation Modulating Polymer Scaffolds for Soft Tissue Repair</title>
      <dc:description>
An intrinsic inflammation modulating bioscaffold is developed by 3D&#8208;bioprinting for the surgical soft tissue repair. The bioscaffold is designed to sequester proinflammatory cytokines and acts as an inflammation trap. The in vivo studies in rat ventral hernia model have demonstrated the enhanced efficacy of the bioscaffold by inhibiting visceral adhesions formation and minimizing postsurgical complications.








Abstract
Development of inflammation modulating polymer scaffolds for soft tissue repair with minimal postsurgical complications is a compelling clinical need. However, the current standard of care soft tissue repair meshes for hernia repair is highly inflammatory and initiates a dysregulated inflammatory process causing visceral adhesions and postsurgical complications. Herein, the development of an inflammation modulating biomaterial scaffold (bioscaffold) for soft tissue repair is presented. The bioscaffold design is based on the idea that, if the excess proinflammatory cytokines are sequestered from the site of injury by the surgical implantation of a bioscaffold, the inflammatory response can be modulated, and the visceral adhesion formations and postsurgical complications can be minimized. The bioscaffold is fabricated by 3D&#8208;bioprinting of an in situ phosphate crosslinked poly(vinyl alcohol) polymer. In vivo efficacy of the bioscaffold is evaluated in a rat ventral hernia model. In vivo proinflammatory cytokine expression analysis and histopathological analysis of the tissues have confirmed that the bioscaffold acts as an inflammation trap and captures the proinflammatory cytokines secreted at the implant site and effectively modulates the local inflammation without the need for exogenous anti&#8208;inflammatory agents. The bioscaffold is very effective in inhibiting visceral adhesions formation and minimizing postsurgical complications.

      <title>Second Near&#8208;Infrared Photothermal Semiconducting Polymer Nanoadjuvant for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>
A second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) photothermal semiconducting polymer nanoadjuvant is developed for enhanced cancer immunotherapy. Upon NIR&#8208;II photoirradiation, the nanoadjuvant exerts photothermal effect to induce immunogenic cell death and on&#8208;demand release of toll&#8208;like receptor agonist, which enhances dendritic cell maturation. A synergistic action of photothermal immunotherapy thus occurs to inhibit the growth of primary and distant tumors and eliminate lung metastasis.








Abstract
Immunotherapy has offered new treatment options for cancer; however, the therapeutic benefits are often modest and desired to be improved. A semiconducting polymer nanoadjuvant (SPNIIR) with a photothermally triggered cargo release for second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) photothermal immunotherapy is reported here. SPNIIR consists of a semiconducting polymer nanoparticle core as an NIR&#8208;II photothermal converter, which is doped with a toll&#8208;like receptor (TLR) agonist as an immunotherapy adjuvant and coated with a thermally responsive lipid shell. Upon NIR&#8208;II photoirradiation, SPNIIR effectively generates heat not only to ablate tumors and induce immunogenic cell death (ICD), but also to melt the lipid layers for on&#8208;demand release of the TLR agonist. The combination of ICD and activation of TLR7/TLR8 enhances the maturation of dendritic cells, which amplifies anti&#8208;tumor immune responses. Thus, a single treatment of SPNIIR&#8208;mediated NIR&#8208;II photothermal immunotherapy effectively inhibits growth of both primary and distant tumors and eliminates lung metastasis in a murine mouse model. This study thus provides a remote&#8208;controlled smart delivery system to synergize photomedicine with immunotherapy for enhanced cancer treatment.

      <title>Recognition and Removal of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; by a Heteromultivalent Macrocyclic Coassembly: A Potential Strategy for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease</title>
      <dc:description>
A heteromultivalent coassembly composed of cyclodextrin and calixarene (CD&#8211;CA coassembly) according to the composition of amino acids in A&#946;1&#8208;42 effectively recognizes and disaggregates A&#946;1&#8208;42 fibrils. Intranasal administration of the CD&#8211;CA coassembly eliminates amyloid plaque and neurodegeneration in the brain, and improves cognitive deficits in 5xFAD mice. This supramolecular approach is a promising novel strategy for treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD).








Abstract
The imbalance of amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) production and clearance causes aggregation of A&#946;1&#8208;42 monomers to form fibrils and amyloid plaques, which is an indispensable process in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and eventually leads to pathological changes and cognitive impairment. Consequently, A&#946;1&#8208;42 is the most important target for the treatment of AD. However, developing a single treatment method that can recognize A&#946;1&#8208;42, inhibit A&#946;1&#8208;42 fibrillation, eliminate amyloid plaques, improve cognitive impairments, and alleviate AD&#8208;like pathology is challenging. Here, a coassembly composed of cyclodextrin (CD) and calixarene (CA) is designed, and it is used as an anti&#8208;A&#946; therapy agent. The CD&#8211;CA coassembly is based on the previously reported heteromultivalent recognition strategy and is able to successfully eliminate amyloid plaques and degrade A&#946;1&#8208;42 monomers in 5xFAD mice. More importantly, the coassembly improves recognition and spatial cognition deficits, and synaptic plasticity impairment in the 5xFAD mice. In addition, the coassembly ameliorates AD&#8208;like pathology including prevention of neuronal apoptosis and oxidant stress, and alteration of M1/M2 microglial polarization states. This supramolecular approach makes full use of both molecular recognition and self&#8208;assembly of macrocyclic amphiphiles, and is a promising novel strategy for AD treatment.

However, developing a single treatment method that can recognize A&#946;&lt;sub&gt;1&#8208;42&lt;/sub&gt;, inhibit A&#946;&lt;sub&gt;1&#8208;42&lt;/sub&gt; fibrillation, eliminate amyloid plaques, improve cognitive impairments, and alleviate AD&#8208;like pathology is challenging. Here, a coassembly composed of cyclodextrin (CD) and calixarene (CA) is designed, and it is used as an anti&#8208;A&#946; therapy agent. The CD&#8211;CA coassembly is based on the previously reported heteromultivalent recognition strategy and is able to successfully eliminate amyloid plaques and degrade A&#946;&lt;sub&gt;1&#8208;42&lt;/sub&gt; monomers in 5xFAD mice. More importantly, the coassembly improves recognition and spatial cognition deficits, and synaptic plasticity impairment in the 5xFAD mice. In addition, the coassembly ameliorates AD&#8208;like pathology including prevention of neuronal apoptosis and oxidant stress, and alteration of M1/M2 microglial polarization states. This supramolecular approach makes full use of both molecular recognition and self&#8208;assembly of macrocyclic amphiphiles, and is a promising novel strategy for AD treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nanomaterials Facilitating Microbial Extracellular Electron Transfer at Interfaces</title>
      <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;electrochemical systems (BESs) harnessing the microbial extracellular electron transfer (EET) process have attracted worldwide interest. Recent advances in nanomaterials facilitating EET at both the bacteria&#8211;electrode and the biotic interface are summarized. The behavior of nanomaterials in different EET routes and their influence on BESs performance are described, which will guide rational design of EET&#8208;related materials and better understanding of EET mechanisms.








Abstract
Electrochemically active bacteria can transport their metabolically generated electrons to anodes, or accept electrons from cathodes to synthesize high&#8208;value chemicals and fuels, via a process known as extracellular electron transfer (EET). Harnessing of this microbial EET process has led to the development of microbial bio&#8208;electrochemical systems (BESs), which can achieve the interconversion of electrical and chemical energy and enable electricity generation, hydrogen production, electrosynthesis, wastewater treatment, desalination, water and soil remediation, and sensing. Here, the focus is on the current understanding of the microbial EET process occurring at both the bacteria&#8211;electrode interface and the biotic interface, as well as some attempts to improve the EET by using various nanomaterials. The behavior of nanomaterials in different EET routes and their influence on the performance of BESs are described. The inherent mechanisms will guide rational design of EET&#8208;related materials and lead to a better understanding of EET mechanisms.

      <title>Assembly of Multi&#8208;Spheroid Cellular Architectures by Programmable Droplet Merging</title>
      <dc:description>
Artificial multicellular systems allow biological structures and behavior to be reconstituted in vitro in the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. In this work, a programmable droplet merging method is demonstrated for high&#8208;throughput generation of complex multi&#8208;spheroidal cellular architectures.

Abstract
Artificial multicellular systems are gaining importance in the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Reconstruction of complex tissue architectures in vitro is nevertheless challenging, and methods permitting controllable and high&#8208;throughput fabrication of complex multicellular architectures are needed. Here, a facile and high&#8208;throughput method is developed based on a tunable droplet&#8208;fusion technique, allowing programmed assembly of multiple cell spheroids into complex multicellular architectures. The droplet&#8208;fusion technique allows for construction of various multicellular architectures (double&#8208;spheroids, multi&#8208;spheroids, hetero&#8208;spheroids) in a miniaturized high&#8208;density array format. As an example of application, the propagation of Wnt signaling is investigated within hetero&#8208;spheroids formed from two fused Wnt&#8208;releasing and Wnt&#8208;reporter cell spheroids. The developed method provides an approach for miniaturized, high&#8208;throughput construction of complex 3D multicellular architectures and can be applied for studying various biological processes including cell signaling, cancer invasion, embryogenesis, and neural development.

      <title>Linear Electro&#8208;Optic Modulation in Highly Polarizable Organic Perovskites</title>
      <dc:description>
The linear electro&#8208;optic (EO) effect in organic perovskites is demonstrated. The crystal structures and polarizability can be modified by the rational design of the organic components to realize an enhancement of the EO performance. This work provides a molecular perspective on the design of organic perovskites for EO modulation and new applications in nonlinear optics.








Abstract
Electrical&#8208;to&#8208;optical signal conversion is widely employed in information technology and is implemented using on&#8208;chip optical modulators. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art modulator technologies are incompatible with silicon manufacturing techniques: inorganic nonlinear crystals such as LiNbO3 are integrated with silicon photonic chips only using complex approaches, and hybrid silicon&#8211;LiNbO3 optical modulators show either low bandwidth or high operating voltage. Organic perovskites are solution&#8208;processed materials readily integrated with silicon photonics; and organic molecules embedded within the perovskite scaffold allow in principle for high polarizability. However, it is found that the large molecules required for high polarizability also require an increase of the size of the perovskite cavity: specifically, using the highly polarizable DR2+ (R = H, F, Cl) in the A site necessitates the exploration of new X&#8208;site options. Only by introducing BF4&#8211; as the X&#8208;site molecule is it possible to synthesize (DCl)(NH4)(BF4)3, a material exhibiting a linear EO coefficient of 20 pm V&#8211;1, which is 10 times higher than that of metal halide perovskites and is a 1.5 fold enhancement compared to reported organic perovskites. The EO response of the organic perovskite approaches that of LiNbO3 (reff&#160;&#8776; 30 pm V&#8211;1) and highlights the promise of rationally designed organic perovskites for use in efficient EO modulators.

      <title>Colors of Single&#8208;Wall Carbon Nanotubes</title>
      <dc:description>
Colors of 466 species of single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are revealed by experiments on clean dry thin films and modeling of the carbon nanotube absorbance spectra. A quantitative coloration model of SWCNTs is proposed and is verified by existing experimental data. This model predicts the existence of brilliantly colored carbon nanotube films that can display the full rainbow.








Abstract
Although single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) exhibit various colors in suspension, directly synthesized SWCNT films usually appear black. Recently, a unique one&#8208;step method for directly fabricating green and brown films has been developed. Such remarkable progress, however, has brought up several new questions. The coloration mechanism, potentially achievable colors, and color controllability of SWCNTs are unknown. Here, a quantitative model is reported that can predict the specific colors of SWCNT films and unambiguously identify the coloration mechanism. Using this model, colors of 466 different SWCNT species are calculated, which reveals a broad spectrum of potentially achievable colors of SWCNTs. The calculated colors are in excellent agreement with existing experimental data. Furthermore, the theory predicts the existence of many brilliantly colored SWCNT films, which are experimentally expected. This study shows that SWCNTs as a form of pure carbon, can display a full spectrum of vivid colors, which is expected to complement the general understanding of carbon materials.

Abstract
Metal oxide resistive switching memories have been a crucial component for the requirements of the Internet of Things, which demands ultra&#8208;low power and high&#8208;density devices with new computing principles, exploiting low cost green products and technologies. Most of the reported resistive switching devices use conventional methods (physical and chemical vapor deposition), which are quite expensive due to their up&#8208;scale production. Solution&#8208;processing methods have been improved, being now a reliable technology that offers many advantages for resistive random&#8208;access memory (RRAM) such as high versatility, large area uniformity, transparency, low&#8208;cost and a simple fabrication of two&#8208;terminal structures. Solution&#8208;based metal oxide RRAM devices are emergent and promising non&#8208;volatile memories for future electronics. In this review, a brief history of non&#8208;volatile memories is highlighted as well as the present status of solution&#8208;based metal oxide resistive random&#8208;access memory (S&#8208;RRAM). Then, a focus on describing the solution synthesis parameters of S&#8208;RRAMs which induce a massive influence in the overall performance of these devices is discussed. Next, a precise analysis is performed on the metal oxide thin film and electrode interface and the recent advances on S&#8208;RRAM that will allow their large&#8208;area manufacturing. Finally, the figures of merit and the main challenges in S&#8208;RRAMs are discussed and future trends are proposed.

      <title>Ultrasoft and High&#8208;Mobility Block Copolymers for Skin&#8208;Compatible Electronics</title>
      <dc:description>
Triblock copolymers (TBCs) comprising a high&#8208;performance polymer semiconductor endcapped with soft elastomeric chains can phase segregate on the nanoscale, while preserving the properties of the individual blocks. The TBCs are ultrasoft (5 MPa), electronically functional (0.1 cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1), stretchable and durable, and maintain conductivity after 1500 cycles to 50% strain in a doped state.








Abstract
Polymer semiconductors (PSCs) are an essential component of organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), but their potential for stretchable electronics is limited by their brittleness and failure susceptibility upon strain. Herein, a covalent connection of two state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymers&#8212;semiconducting poly&#8208;diketo&#8208;pyrrolopyrrole&#8208;thienothiophene (PDPP&#8208;TT) and elastomeric poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)&#8212;in a single triblock copolymer (TBC) chain is reported, which enables high charge carrier mobility and low modulus in one system. Three TBCs containing up to 65 wt% PDMS were obtained, and the TBC with 65 wt% PDMS content exhibits mobilities up to 0.1 cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, in the range of the fully conjugated reference polymer PDPP&#8208;TT (0.7 cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1). The TBC is ultrasoft with a low elastic modulus (5 MPa) in the range of mammalian tissue. The TBC exhibits an excellent stretchability and extraordinary durability, fully maintaining the initial electric conductivity in a doped state after 1500 cycles to 50% strain.

      <title>Selective Ethanol Oxidation Reaction at the Rh&#8211;SnO2 Interface</title>
      <dc:description>
The Rh&#8211;SnO2 interface can be used as a highly active and selective site for ethanol oxidation to form CO2, where the strong synergy at the Rh&#8211;SnO2 interface significantly facilitates both electron transfer from the Rh to the Sn species and oxidation of the poisonous intermediates, leading to improved selectivity to the C1 pathway and excellent durability for the ethanol oxidation reaction.








Abstract
Direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs) are regarded as an attractive power source with high energy density, bio&#8208;renewability, and convenient storage and transportation. However, the anodic reaction of DEFCs, that is, the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR), suffers from poor efficiency due to the low selectivity to CO2 (C1 pathway) and high selectivity to CH3COOH (C2 pathway). In this study, the selective EOR to CO2 can be achieved at the Rh&#8211;SnO2 interface in SnO2&#8211;Rh nanosheets (NSs). The optimized catalyst of 0.2SnO2&#8211;Rh NSs/C exhibits excellent alkaline EOR performance with a mass activity of 213.2 mA mgRh&#8722;1 and a Faraday efficiency of 72.8% for the C1 pathway, which are 1.7 and 1.9 times higher than those of Rh NSs/C. Mechanism studies indicate that the strong synergy at the Rh&#8211;SnO2 interface significantly promotes the breaking of C&#63743;C bond of C2H5OH to form CO2, and facilitates oxidation of the poisonous intermediates (*CO and *CH3) to suppress the deactivation of the catalyst. This work not only provides a highly selective, active, and stable catalyst for the EOR, but also promotes fundamental research for the design of efficient catalysts via interface modification.

      <title>A Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium/Carbon Nanotube Hybrid for Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
A dendrite&#8208;free Li/carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrid has been fabricated by direct coating molten Li on CNTs for Li&#8208;metal batteries. Favorable thermodynamic and kinetic conditions are a powerful force to drive the rapid lift upwards and infusion of molten Li into CNTs network. The obtained hybrid exhibits super&#8208;stable function even at an ultrahigh current density.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal is promising in the next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. However, its practical application is still hindered by the poor cycling performance and serious safety issues for the consequence of dendritic Li. Herein, a dendrite&#8208;free Li/carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrid is proposed, which is fabricated by direct coating molten Li on CNTs, for Li&#8208;metal batteries. The favorable thermodynamic and kinetic conditions are the powerful force to drive the rapid lift upwards and infusion of molten Li into CNTs network, which is the key to form a uniform metallic layer in Li/CNTs hybrid. The obtained hybrid indicates super&#8208;stable functions even at an ultrahigh current density of 40&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 2000 cycles with a stripping/plating capacity of 2 mAh cm&#8722;2 in symmetric cells. Subsequently, this hybrid also demonstrates a significantly decreased resistance, excellent cycling stability at high current density and flexibility in the full Li&#8208;S battery. This work provides valuable concepts in fabricating Li anodes toward Li&#8208;metal batteries and beyond for their high&#8208;level services.

      <title>Strong Ferromagnetism Achieved via Breathing Lattices in Atomically Thin Cobaltites</title>
      <dc:description>
Atomically thin cobaltite remaining strongly ferromagnetic is achieved by local structural modification. A surprisingly large magnetic moment (0.5 &#956;B/Co) and Curie temperature (75 K), values larger than previously reported for any monolayer oxides, are observed in the LaCoO3 monolayer, demonstrating a strategy for creating functional quantum heterostructures by exploiting atomic interface engineering.








Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional quantum materials that remain strongly ferromagnetic down to monolayer thickness are highly desired for spintronic applications. Although oxide materials are important candidates for the next generation of spintronics, ferromagnetism decays severely when the thickness is scaled to the nanometer regime, leading to deterioration of device performance. Here, a methodology is reported for maintaining strong ferromagnetism in insulating LaCoO3 (LCO) layers down to the thickness of a single unit cell. It is found that the magnetic and electronic states of LCO are linked intimately to the structural parameters of adjacent &#8220;breathing lattice&#8221; SrCuO2 (SCO). As the dimensionality of SCO is reduced, the lattice constant elongates over 10% along the growth direction, leading to a significant distortion of the CoO6 octahedra, and promoting a higher spin state and long&#8208;range spin ordering. For atomically thin LCO layers, surprisingly large magnetic moment (0.5 &#956;B/Co) and Curie temperature (75 K), values larger than previously reported for any monolayer oxides are observed. The results demonstrate a strategy for creating ultrathin ferromagnetic oxides by exploiting atomic heterointerface engineering, confinement&#8208;driven structural transformation, and spin&#8208;lattice entanglement in strongly correlated materials.

      <title>Gate&#8208;Tunable Polar Optical Phonon to Piezoelectric Scattering in Few&#8208;Layer Bi2O2Se for High&#8208;Performance Thermoelectrics</title>
      <dc:description>
The thermoelectric (TE) transport in few&#8208;layer Bi2O2Se is probed, where gating can effectively modulate its scattering mechanism from polar optical phonon to piezoelectric scattering. This facilitates the capacity of drastic mobility engineering, and high TE performance over a wide range of temperature can be achieved due to persistently high mobility arising from the highly gate&#8208;tunable scattering mechanism.








Abstract
Atomically thin Bi2O2Se has emerged as a new member in 2D materials with ultrahigh carrier mobility and excellent air&#8208;stability, showing great potential for electronics and optoelectronics. In addition, its ferroelectric nature renders an ultralow thermal conductivity, making it a perfect candidate for thermoelectrics. In this work, the thermoelectric performance of 2D Bi2O2Se is investigated over a wide temperature range (20&#8211;300 K). A gate&#8208;tunable transition from polar optical phonon (POP) scattering to piezoelectric scattering is observed, which facilitates the capacity of drastic mobility engineering in 2D Bi2O2Se. Consequently, a high power factor of more than 400&#160;&#181;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2 over an unprecedented temperature range (80&#8211;200 K) is achieved, corresponding to the persistently high mobility arising from the highly gate&#8208;tunable scattering mechanism. This finding provides a new avenue for maximizing thermoelectric performance by changing the scattering mechanism and carrier mobility over a wide temperature range.

This finding provides a new avenue for maximizing thermoelectric performance by changing the scattering mechanism and carrier mobility over a wide temperature range.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Emerging Light&#8208;Emitting Materials for Photonic Integration</title>
      <dc:description>
Emerging 2D and metal halide perovskites light&#8208;emitting materials for photonic integration are reviewed, including their unique optical properties, fabrication methods, and the progress made in realizing on&#8208;chip light emitters based on these materials. Moreover, the existing challenges and future perspectives are discussed toward the realization of high&#8208;efficiency light sources for optical interconnections.








Abstract
The arrival of the information explosion era is urging the development of large&#8208;bandwidth high&#8208;data&#8208;rate optical interconnection technology. Up to now, the biggest stumbling block in optical interconnections has been the lack of efficient light sources despite significant progress that has been made in germanium&#8208;on&#8208;silicon (Ge&#8208;on&#8208;Si) and III&#8208;V&#8208;on&#8208;silicon (III&#8208;V&#8208;on&#8208;Si) lasers. 2D materials and metal halide perovskites have attracted much attention in recent years, and exhibit distinctive advantages in the application of on&#8208;chip light emitters. Herein, this Progress Report reviews the recent progress made in light&#8208;emitting materials with a focus on new materials, i.e., 2D materials and metal halide perovskites. The report briefly introduces the current status of Ge&#8208;on&#8208;Si and III&#8208;V&#8208;on&#8208;Si lasers and discusses the advances of 2D and perovskite light&#8208;emitting materials for photonic integration, including their optical properties, preparation methods, as well as the light sources based on these materials. Finally, challenges and perspectives of these emerging materials on the way to the efficient light sources are discussed.

      <title>Path&#8208;Dependent Thermal Metadevice beyond Janus Functionalities</title>
      <dc:description>
A 3D path&#8208;dependent thermal metadevice can be designed to achieve three heat transfer behaviors (cloaking, concentrating, and transparency) along different directions at the same time by breaking the symmetry using successive 3D transformations. This path&#8208;dependent strategy provides a new dimension for multifunctional metamaterial devices in the thermal field and for more general diffusion processes.








Abstract
Janus metamaterials, metasurfaces, and monolayers have received intensive attention in nanophotonics and 2D materials. Their core concept is to introduce asymmetry along the wave propagation direction, by stacking different materials or layers of meta&#8208;atoms, or breaking out&#8208;of&#8208;plane mirror asymmetry with external biases. Nevertheless, it has been hitherto elusive to realize a diffusive Janus metadevice, since scalar diffusion systems such as heat conduction normally operate in the absence of polarization control, spin manipulation, or electric&#8208;field stimuli, which all are widely used in achieving optical Janus devices. It is even more challenging, if not impossible, for a single diffusive metadevice to exhibit more than two thermal functions. Here a path&#8208;dependent thermal metadevice beyond Janus characteristics is proposed, which can exhibit three distinct thermal behaviors (cloaking, concentrating, and transparency) under different directions of heat flow. The rotation transformation mechanism of thermal conductivity provides a robust platform to assign a specific thermal behavior in any direction. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment of anisotropic in&#8208;plane conduction successfully validates such a path&#8208;dependent trifunction thermal metamaterial device. It is anticipated that this path&#8208;dependent strategy can provide a new dimension for multifunctional metamaterial devices in the thermal field, as well as for a more general diffusion process.

      <title>Activatable Polymer Nanoenzymes for Photodynamic Immunometabolic Cancer Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
An activatable organic nanoenzyme (SPNK) is developed for photodynamic immunometabolic cancer therapy. Near&#8208;infrared photoirradiation of SPNK can not only induce immunogenic cell death by photodynamic therapy but also activate kynureninase to in situ degrade immunosuppressive kynurenine, leading to enhanced systemic antitumor immunity and inhibition of both primary and distant tumors.








Abstract
Tumor immunometabolism contributes substantially to tumor proliferation and immune cell activity, and thus plays a crucial role in the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. Modulation of immunometabolism to boost cancer immunotherapy is mostly based on small&#8208;molecule inhibitors, which often encounter the issues of off&#8208;target adverse effects, drug resistance, and unsustainable response. In contrast, enzymatic therapeutics can potentially bypass these limitations but has been less exploited. Herein, an organic polymer nanoenzyme (SPNK) with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photoactivatable immunotherapeutic effects is reported for photodynamic immunometabolic therapy. SPNK is composed of a semiconducting polymer core conjugated with kynureninase (KYNase) via PEGylated singlet oxygen (1O2) cleavable linker. Upon NIR photoirradiation, SPNK generates 1O2 not only to exert photodynamic effect to induce the immunogenic cell death of cancer, but also to unleash KYNase and trigger its activity to degrade the immunosuppressive kynurenine (Kyn). Such a combinational effect mediated by SPNK promotes the proliferation and infiltration of effector T cells, enhances systemic antitumor T cell immunity, and ultimately permits inhibition of both primary and distant tumors in living mice. Therefore, this study provides a promising photodynamic approach toward remotely controlled enzymatic immunomodulation for improved anticancer therapy.

      <title>Magnetic Moments Induced by Atomic Vacancies in Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Flakes</title>
      <dc:description>
Localized magnetic moments induced by Pt vacancies in air&#8208;stable non&#8208;magnetic PtSe2 nanoflakes are reported and the induced magnetic moments in PtSe2 nanoflakes are found to be nearly thickness dependent in thinner nanoflakes. The authors&#8217; findings demonstrate a new way to induce magnetism in non&#8208;magnetic 2D materials.








Abstract
2D magnetism plays a key role in both fundamental physics and potential device applications. However, the instability of the discovered 2D magnetic materials has been one main obstacle in deep research and potential application of 2D magnetism. Here, a localized magnetic moment induced by Pt vacancies in air&#8208;stable type&#8208;II Dirac semimetal PtSe2 flakes is reported. The localized magnetic moments give rise to the Kondo effect, evidenced by logarithmic increment of resistance with decreasing temperature and isotropic negative longitudinal magnetoresistance. Additionally, the induced magnetic moment and Kondo temperature appear to depend on thickness in the thinner samples (&lt;10&#160;nm). The small magnetocrystalline anisotropy revealed by first&#8208;principles calculation indicates that the magnetic moments are randomly localized instead of long&#8208;range ordered. The findings demonstrate a new means to induce magnetism in 2D non&#8208;magnetic materials.
